functional theory calculations consists in optimizing orbitals for a
self-consistent solution of the Roothaan-Hall equations in an iterative
process. It is often ignored that multiple self-consistent solutions can exist,
several of which may correspond to minima of the energy functional. In addition
to the difficulty sometimes encountered to converge the calculation to a
self-consistent solution, one must ensure that the correct self-consistent
solution was found, typically the one with the lowest electronic energy.
Convergence to an unwanted solution is in general not trivial to detect and
will deliver incorrect energy and molecular properties, and accordingly a
misleading description of chemical reactivity. Wrong conclusions based on
incorrect self-consistent field convergence are particularly cumbersome in
automated calculations met in high-throughput virtual screening, structure
optimizations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and in real-time explorations of
chemical reactivity, where the vast amount of data can hardly be manually
inspected. Here, we introduce a fast and automated approach to detect and cure
incorrect orbital convergence, which is especially suited for electronic
structure calculations on sequences of molecular structures. Our approach
consists of a randomized perturbation of the converged electron density
(matrix) intended to push orbital convergence to solutions that correspond to
another stationary point (of potentially lower electronic energy) in the
variational parameter space of an electronic wave function approximation.

during an eruptive flare or coronal mass ejection is considered. The
reconnection has two phases: first of all, 3D ""zipper reconnection"" propagates
along the initial coronal arcade, parallel to the polarity inversion line
(PIL), then subsequent quasi-2D ""main phase reconnection"" in the low corona
around a flux rope during its eruption produces coronal loops and chromospheric
ribbons that propagate away from the PIL in a direction normal to it.
  One scenario starts with a sheared arcade: the zipper reconnection creates a
twisted flux rope of roughly one turn ($2\pi$ radians of twist), and then main
phase reconnection builds up the bulk of the erupting flux rope with a
relatively uniform twist of a few turns. A second scenario starts with a
pre-existing flux rope under the arcade. Here the zipper phase can create a
core with many turns that depend on the ratio of the magnetic fluxes in the
newly formed flare ribbons and the new flux rope. Main phase reconnection then
adds a layer of roughly uniform twist to the twisted central core. Both phases
and scenarios are modeled in a simple way that assumes the initial magnetic
flux is fragmented along the PIL. The model uses conservation of magnetic
helicity and flux, together with equipartition of magnetic helicity, to deduce
the twist of the erupting flux rope in terms the geometry of the initial
configuration.
  Interplanetary observations show some flux ropes have a fairly uniform twist,
which could be produced when the zipper phase and any pre-existing flux rope
possess small or moderate twist (up to one or two turns). Other interplanetary
flux ropes have highly twisted cores (up to five turns), which could be
produced when there is a pre-existing flux rope and an active zipper phase that
creates substantial extra twist.

  zeroth derived functors, has been added to the previous version",,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is the first one in a series of three dealing with the concept of
injective stabilization of the tensor product and its applications. Its primary
goal is to collect known facts and establish a basic operational calculus that
will be used in the subsequent parts. This is done in greater generality than
is necessary for the stated goal. Several results of independent interest are
also established. They include, among other things, connections with
satellites, an explicit construction of the stabilization of a finitely
presented functor, various exactness properties of the injectively stable
functors, a construction, from a functor and a short exact sequence, of a
doubly-infinite exact sequence by splicing the injective stabilization of the
functor and its derived functors. When specialized to the tensor product with a
finitely presented module, the injective stabilization with coefficients in the
ring is isomorphic to the 1-torsion functor. The Auslander-Reiten formula is
extended to a more general formula, which holds for arbitrary (i.e., not
necessarily finite) modules over arbitrary associative rings with identity.
Weakening of the assumptions in the theorems of Eilenberg and Watts leads to
characterizations of the requisite zeroth derived functors.
  The subsequent papers, provide applications of the developed techniques.
Part~II deals with new notions of torsion module and cotorsion module of a
module. This is done for arbitrary modules over arbitrary rings. Part~III
introduces a new concept, called the asymptotic stabilization of the tensor
product. The result is closely related to different variants of stable homology
(these are generalizations of Tate homology to arbitrary rings). A comparison
transformation from Vogel homology to the asymptotic stabilization of the
tensor product is constructed and shown to be epic.

  results added. The most significant aspect of this version is the fundamental
  role played by the trace of injectives and, as a consequence, a determination
  of all derived functors of torsion and cotorsion over rings with a suitable
  finiteness condition. New material is typeset in purple and blue colors",,"10.1016/j.jalgebra.2019.11.016",,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formalism of injective stabilization of additive functors is used to
define a new notion of the torsion submodule of a module. It applies to
arbitrary modules over arbitrary rings. For arbitrary modules over commutative
domains it coincides with the classical torsion, and for finitely presented
modules over arbitrary rings it coincides with the Bass torsion. A formally
dual approach -- based on projective stabilization -- gives rise to a new
concept: the cotorsion quotient module of a module. This is done in complete
generality -- the new concept is defined for any module over any ring. Unlike
torsion, cotorsion does not have classical prototypes.
  General properties of these constructs are established. It is shown that the
Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor applied to the cotorsion functor returns the
torsion functor. As a consequence, a ring is one-sided absolutely pure if and
only if each pure injective on the other side is cotorsion-free. If the
injective envelope of the ring is finitely presented, then the right adjoint of
the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor applied to the torsion functor returns the
cotorsion functor. This correspondence establishes a duality between torsion
and cotorsion over such rings. In particular, this duality applies to artin
algebras. It is also shown that, over any ring, the character module of the
torsion of a module is isomorphic to the cotorsion of the character module of
the module. Under various finiteness conditions on the injective envelope of
the ring, the derived functors of torsion and cotorsion are computed.

the proper registering of callbacks to receive control from the framework with
appropriate application programming interface (API) calls to delegate back to

population responsible for transmitting Dengue Fever. Since the {\em Aedes
Aegypti} mosquito is also a primary vector for the recent Zika and Chikungunya
epidemics across the Americas, a detailed monitoring of periods with favorable
climate conditions for mosquito profusion may improve the timing of
vector-control efforts and other urgent public health strategies. We apply
dimensionality reduction techniques and machine-learning algorithms to climate
time series data and analyze their connection to the occurrence of Dengue
outbreaks for seven major cities in Brazil. Specifically, we have identified
two key variables and a period during the annual cycle that are highly
predictive of epidemic outbreaks. The key variables are the frequency of
precipitation and temperature during an approximately two month window of the
winter season preceding the outbreak. Thus simple climate signatures may be
influencing Dengue outbreaks even months before their occurrence. Some of the
more challenging datasets required usage of compressive-sensing procedures to
estimate missing entries for temperature and precipitation records. Our results
indicate that each Brazilian capital considered has a unique frequency of
precipitation and temperature signature in the winter preceding a Dengue
outbreak. Such climate contributions on vector populations are key factors in
dengue dynamics which could lead to more accurate prediction models and early
warning systems. Finally, we show that critical temperature and precipitation
signatures may vary significantly from city to city, suggesting that the
interplay between climate variables and dengue outbreaks is more complex than
generally appreciated.

vertical stand structure even of understory layers can be derived. This paper
presents a tree segmentation approach for multi-story stands that stratifies
the point cloud to canopy layers and segments individual tree crowns within
each layer using a digital surface model based tree segmentation method. The
novelty of the approach is the stratification procedure that separates the
point cloud to an overstory and multiple understory tree canopy layers by
analyzing vertical distributions of LiDAR points within overlapping locales.
The procedure does not make a priori assumptions about the shape and size of
the tree crowns and can, independent of the tree segmentation method, be
utilized to vertically stratify tree crowns of forest canopies. We applied the
proposed approach to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest - a natural
deciduous forest with complex and highly variable terrain and vegetation
structure. The segmentation results showed that using the stratification
procedure strongly improved detecting understory trees (from 46% to 68%) at the
cost of introducing a fair number of over-segmented understory trees (increased
from 1% to 16%), while barely affecting the overall segmentation quality of
overstory trees. Results of vertical stratification of the canopy showed that
the point density of understory canopy layers were suboptimal for performing a
reasonable tree segmentation, suggesting that acquiring denser LiDAR point
clouds would allow more improvements in segmenting understory trees. As shown
by inspecting correlations of the results with forest structure, the
segmentation approach is applicable to a variety of forest types.

quantized gauge ambiguity and is normally observed at surfaces via the surface
charge density, while shift current is a bulk property and is described by
shift vector gauge invariant at each point in momentum space. They are
connected because the same optical transitions that are described in shift
currents pick out a relative gauge between valence and conduction bands. We
also discuss subtleties arising when there are points at the Brillouin zone

crowns within a LiDAR point cloud representing an arbitrarily large forested
area. The approach uses a single-processor tree segmentation algorithm as a
building block in order to process the data delivered in the shape of tiles in
parallel. The distributed processing is performed in a master-slave manner, in
which the master maintains the global map of the tiles and coordinates the
slaves that segment tree crowns within and across the boundaries of the tiles.
A minimal bias was introduced to the number of detected trees because of trees
lying across the tile boundaries, which was quantified and adjusted for.
Theoretical and experimental analyses of the runtime of the approach revealed a
near linear speedup. The estimated number of trees categorized by crown class
and the associated error margins as well as the height distribution of the
detected trees aligned well with field estimations, verifying that the
distributed approach works correctly. The approach enables providing
information of individual tree locations and point cloud segments for a
forest-level area in a timely manner, which can be used to create detailed
remotely sensed forest inventories. Although the approach was presented for
tree segmentation within LiDAR point clouds, the idea can also be generalized
to scale up processing other big spatial datasets.
  Highlights: - A scalable distributed approach for tree segmentation was
developed and theoretically analyzed. - ~2 million trees in a 7440 ha forest
was segmented in 2.5 hours using 192 cores. - 2% false positive trees were
identified as a result of the distributed run. - The approach can be used to

independent of the boundary conditions. On the other hand, for large $q$, where
the phase transition is discontinuous, the authors recently showed that
$t_{\textrm{mix}}$ is highly sensitive to boundary conditions:
$t_{\textrm{mix}} \geq \exp(cn)$ on an $n\times n$ box with periodic boundary,
yet under free or monochromatic boundary conditions, $t_{\textrm{mix}}
\leq\exp(n^{o(1)})$.
  In this work we classify this effect under boundary conditions that
interpolate between these two (torus vs. free/monochromatic). Specifically, if
one of the $q$ colors is red, mixed boundary conditions such as
red-free-red-free on the 4 sides of the box induce $t_{\textrm{mix}} \geq

systems with features of nonsymmetry and indefiniteness, the robustness of the
direct solvers extends beyond that of the multigrid solver, and relative to the

security and video surveillance. In this paper we propose a novel Accumulative
Motion Context (AMOC) network for addressing this important problem, which
effectively exploits the long-range motion context for robustly identifying the
same person under challenging conditions. Given a video sequence of the same or
different persons, the proposed AMOC network jointly learns appearance
representation and motion context from a collection of adjacent frames using a
two-stream convolutional architecture. Then AMOC accumulates clues from motion
context by recurrent aggregation, allowing effective information flow among
adjacent frames and capturing dynamic gist of the persons. The architecture of
AMOC is end-to-end trainable and thus motion context can be adapted to
complement appearance clues under unfavorable conditions (e.g. occlusions).
Extensive experiments are conduced on three public benchmark datasets, i.e.,
the iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS datasets, to investigate the performance of
AMOC. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AMOC network
outperforms state-of-the-arts for video-based re-identification significantly
and confirm the advantage of exploiting long-range motion context for video
based person re-identification, validating our motivation evidently.

recommendation approach through a storytelling mechanism for promoting the
communication between the user and the recommendation system. Our approach
emphasizes interactivity, explicit user input, and semantic information convey;
thus it can be used by general users without any knowledge of recommendation or
visualization algorithms. We validate our model with data statistics and
demonstrate our approach with case studies from the MovieLens100K dataset. Our
approaches of latent semantic analysis and interactive recommendation can also
be extended to other network-based visualization applications, including

in order to analyze the multi-tier heterogeneous cellular networks where the
base stations in different tiers usually adopt different transmission powers,
we propose a Transmission Power Normalization Model (TPNM), which is able to
convert a multi-tier cellular network into a single-tier network, such that all
base stations have the same normalized transmission power. Then using TPNM, the
signal and interference received at any point in the complex multi-tier
environment can be analyzed by considering the same point in the equivalent
single-tier cellular network model, thus significantly simplifying the
analysis. On this basis, we propose a new user association scheme in
heterogeneous cellular networks, where the base station that leads to the
smallest interference to other co-channel mobile stations is chosen from a set
of candidate base stations that satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) constraint
for an intended mobile station. Numerical results show that the proposed user
association scheme is able to significantly reduce the down-link interference

QC-LDPC codes from group rings. A group ring is a free module (at the same time
a ring) constructed in a natural way from any given ring and any given group.
We present a structure based on the elements of a group ring for constructing
QC-LDPC codes. Some of the previously addressed methods for constructing
QC-LDPC codes based on finite fields are special cases of the proposed
construction method. The constructed QC-LDPC codes perform very well over the
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with iterative decoding in terms
of bit-error probability and block-error probability. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed codes have competitive performance in comparison
with the similar existing LDPC codes. Finally, we propose a new encoding method
for the proposed group ring based QC-LDPC codes that can be implemented faster
than the current encoding methods. The encoding complexity of the proposed
method is analyzed mathematically, and indicates a significate reduction in the
required number of operations, even when compared to the available efficient
encoding methods that have linear time and space complexities.

037113), we obtain a reduced system of ordinary differential equations
describing the mean-field dynamics, with significantly lower dimensionality
compared with the complete set of dynamical equations for the system. We find
that, for sufficiently large networks and degrees, the dynamical behavior of
the reduced system agrees well with that of the full network. This dimensional
reduction allows for an efficient characterization of system phase transitions
and attractors. For networks with tightly peaked degree distributions, the
macroscopic behavior closely resembles that of fully connected networks
previously studied by others. In contrast, networks with scale-free degree
distributions exhibit different macroscopic dynamics due to the emergence of
degree dependent behavior of different oscillators. For nonassortative networks
(i.e., networks without degree correlations) we observe the presence of a
synchronously firing phase that can be suppressed by the presence of either
assortativity or disassortativity in the network. We show that the results
derived here can be used to analyze the effects of network topology on
macroscopic behavior in neuronal networks in a computationally efficient

distinct predictions. Experimental accuracy was so small that worrying about
epistemological problems was not necessary. That is no longer the case. The
underdeterminacy problem between string theory and the standard model for
current possible experimental energies is one example. We need modern inductive
methods for this problem, Bayesian methods or the equivalent Solomonoff
induction. To illustrate the proper way to work with induction problems I will
use the concepts of Solomoff induction to study the status of string theory.
Previous attempts have focused on the Bayesian solution. And they run into the
question of why string theory is widely accepted with no data backing it.
Logically unsupported additions to the Bayesian method were proposed. I will
show here that, by studying the problem from the point of view of the
Solomonoff induction those additions can be understood much better. They are
not ways to update probabilities. Instead, they are considerations about the
priors as well as heuristics to attempt to deal with our finite resources. For
the general problem, Solomonoff induction also makes it clear that there is no
demarcation problem. Every possible idea can be part of a proper scientific
theory. It is just the case that data makes some ideas extremely improbable.
Theories where that does not happen must not be discarded. Rejecting ideas is

polyelectrolyte solutions using a field-theoretic, renormalized Gaussian
fluctuation (RGF) theory. As in simple electrolyte solutions (Z.-G. Wang, Phys.
Rev. E. {\bf 81}, 021501 (2010)), the RGF provides a unified theory for
electrostatic fluctuations, accounting for both dielectric and charge
correlation effects in terms of the self-energy. Unlike simple ions, the
polyelectrolyte self energy depends intimately on the chain conformation, and
our theory naturally provides a self-consistent determination of the response
of intramolecular chain structure to polyelectrolyte and salt concentrations.
The theory captures the expected scaling behavior of chain size from the dilute
to semi-dilute regimes; by properly accounting for chain structure the theory
provides improved estimates of the self energy in dilute solution and correctly
predicts the eventual $N$-independence of the critical temperature and
concentration of salt-free solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes. We show that
the self energy can be interpreted in terms of an infinite-dilution energy
$\mu^\text{el}_{m,0}$ and a finite concentration correlation correction
$\mu^\text{corr}$ which tends to cancel out the former with increasing
concentration.

the dileptonic channel of $t\bar{t}h$ production. We find that (1) the

$5\sigma$ for CP phase $\xi=0,\pi/4,\pi/2$ when the luminosity ${\cal

Hence, viewing differential equations with hysteresis operators in the

whereas diamond does in $2H$ structure. We have also clarified that the
microscopic mechanism of the band-gap variations is attributed to peculiar
electron states $floating$ in internal channel space at the conduction-band
minimum (CBM), and that internal channel length and the electro-static
potential in channel affect the energy level of CBM.

mobility edges at $\pm E_c$ while for $ h > h_c$ all the single particle states

mobility edges, the interacting system can have MBL. Our numerical calculation
of participation ratio in the Fock space and Shannon entropy shows that both
for $h < h_c$ (quarter filled) and $h>h_c$ ($h\sim h_c$ and half filled), many
body states in the middle of the spectrum are delocalized while the low energy
states with $E < E_1$ and the high energy states with $E> E_2$ are localized.
Variance of entanglement entropy (EE) also shows divergence at $E_{1,2}$
indicating a transition from MBL to delocalized regime. We also studied
eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH) and found that the low energy many
body states, which show area law scaling for EE do not obey ETH. The crossings
from volume to area law scaling for EE and from thermal to non-thermal

many body states remain localized for weak to intermediate strength of
interaction and the system shows infinite temperature MBL phase.

complexes. First, we establish an equivalence between the MSA face-weights and
\emph{death times} in the persistence diagram. Next, we show a novel stability
result for the MSA face-weights which, due to our first result, also holds true
for the death and birth times, separately. Our final result concerns a
perturbation of a mean-field model of randomly weighted $d-$complexes. The
$d-$face weights here are perturbation of some i.i.d. distribution while all
the lower-dimensional faces have a weight of $0$. If the perturbations decay
sufficiently quickly, we show that suitably scaled extremal nearest
face-weights, face-weights of the $d-$MSA, and the associated death times
converge to an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. This result completely
characterizes the extremal points of persistence diagrams and MSAs. The point
process convergence and the asymptotic equivalence of three point processes are
new for any weighted random complex model, including even the non-perturbed
case. Lastly, as a consequence of our stability result, we show that Frieze's
$\zeta(3)$ limit for random minimal spanning trees and the recent extension to
random MSAs by Hino and Kanazawa also hold in suitable noisy settings.

the superposition principles to generate a variety of interesting solutions,

at some later finite time. We prove a Wronskian formula for the solutions

a correlated change of extinction and accretion rate, while the minimum around

scale $E_{LV}$ to be at least of the order of $10^{16}$ GeV at $1\sigma$ which
is the GUT scale or even higher $10^{17}$ GeV at $3\sigma$. Our claim is that
this energy can be interpreted as the decoupling scale of massless particles
from spacetime Lorentz violating effects.

energy out of small amounts of not necessarily stable resources. By definition,
Chaos is getting huge changes in the system's output due to unpredictable small
changes in initial conditions, and that means we could take advantage of this
fact and select the proper control system to manipulate system's initial
conditions and inputs in general and get a desirable output out of otherwise a
Chaotic system. That was accomplished by first building some known chaotic
circuit (Chua circuit) and the NI's MultiSim was used to simulate the ANN
control system. It was shown that this technique can also be used to stabilize
some hard to stabilize electronic systems.

  and Management",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effective monitoring and management of environment pollution is key to the
development of modern metropolitan cities. To sustain and to cope with the
exponential growth of the cities with high industrialization, expert decision
making is very essential in this process. A good governance system must be
supported by an actively participating population. In participatory sensing,
individuals and groups engages in the data collection actively and the helps
the city governance to make proper decisions. In this paper, we propose a
participatory sensing based three-tier framework to fight environment pollution
in urban areas of Bangladesh. The framework includes an android application
named `My City, My Environment', a server for storage and computation and also
a web server for the authority to monitor and maintain environmental issues
through expert decision making. We have already developed a prototype system
and deployed it to a small scale and demonstrated the effectiveness of this
framework.
