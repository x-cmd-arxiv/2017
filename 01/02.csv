(2017, Icarus 282, 19-33). That analysis depended largely on photometric data
obtained when the ring system interfered with observations of the globe. In
this study the magnitude and albedo are re-evaluated based on spectrophotometry
obtained during a ring-plane crossing (Karkoschka, 1998, Icarus, 133, 134-146).
A better correction for the illumination phase angle of Saturn's globe is also
derived and it is applied to the spectroscopy. The resulting values for most of
the 12 Johnson-Cousins and Sloan wavelength bands agree reasonably well with
those reported by Mallama et al. but some significant differences are noted.
The revised albedo value for the Rc band reduces the discrepancy with that
inferred from the work of Dyudina et al. (2005, ApJ 618, 973-986).

  attenuation method","PFG diffusion NMR and MRI, anomalous diffusion, diffusion tensor",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomalous diffusion has been investigated in many systems. Pulsed field
gradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion is much more complicated than PFG normal
diffusion. There have been many theoretical and experimental studies for PFG
isotropic anomalous diffusion, but there are very few theoretical treatments
reported for anisotropic anomalous diffusion. Currently, there is not a general
PFG signal attenuation expression, which includes the finite gradient pulse
effect and can treat all three types of anisotropic fractional diffusions:
general fractional diffusion, time fractional diffusion, and space-fractional
diffusion. In this paper, the recently developed instantaneous signal
attenuation (ISA) method was applied to obtain PFG signal attenuation
expression for free and restricted anisotropic anomalous diffusion with two
models: fractal derivative and fractional derivative models. The obtained PFG
signal attenuation expression for anisotropic anomalous diffusion can reduce to
the reported result for PFG anisotropic normal diffusion. The results can also
reduce to reported PFG isotropic anomalous diffusion results obtained by
effective phase shift diffusion equation method and instantaneous signal
attenuation method. For anisotropic space-fractional diffusion, the obtained
result agrees with that obtained by the modified Bloch equation method.
Additionally, The PFG signal attenuation expressions for free and restricted
anisotropic curvilinear diffusions were derived by the traditional method, the
results of which agree with the PFG anisotropic fractional diffusion results
based on the fractional derivative model. The powder pattern of PFG anisotropic
diffusion was also discussed. The results here improve our understanding of PFG
anomalous diffusion, and provide new formalisms for PFG anisotropic anomalous
diffusion in NMR and MRI.

represents the equilibrium ensemble at every packing fraction in an annealing
schedule. The algorithm and its equilibration properties are described and
results are presented for a glass-forming fluid composed of a 50/50 mixture of

observed consistently during magnetisation when the applied pulsed field, Ba,

this phenomenon. This flux jump behaviour enables the magnetic flux to
penetrate fully to the centre of the bulk superconductor, resulting in full

is that for every even integer $k \ge 4$, there exists $c>0$ such that the

and fractional polarization along the jets, Faraday effects and structure of
Faraday-corrected polarization images. Wavelength-dependence of the fractional
polarization and polarization angle is consistent with external Faraday
rotation, while some sources show internal rotation. The RM changes along the
jets, systematically increasing its value towards synchrotron self-absorbed
cores at shorter wavelengths. The highest core RM reaches 16,900 rad/m^2 in the
source rest frame for the quasar 0952+179, suggesting the presence of highly
magnetized, dense media in these regions. The typical RM of transparent jet
regions has values of an order of a hundred rad/m^2. Significant transverse
rotation measure gradients are observed in seven sources. The magnetic field in
the Faraday screen has no preferred orientation, and is observed to be random

anisotropies and energy spectrum will be limited by our understanding and
modeling of foregrounds. Not only does more information need to be gathered and
combined, but also novel approaches for the modeling of foregrounds,
commensurate with the vast improvements in sensitivity, have to be explored.
Here, we study the inevitable effects of spatial averaging on the spectral
shapes of typical foreground components, introducing a moment approach, which
naturally extends the list of foreground parameters that have to be determined
through measurements or constrained by theoretical models. Foregrounds are
thought of as a superposition of individual emitting volume elements along the
line of sight and across the sky, which then are observed through an
instrumental beam. The beam and line of sight averages are inevitable. Instead
of assuming a specific model for the distributions of physical parameters, our
method identifies natural new spectral shapes for each foreground component
that can be used to extract parameter moments (e.g., mean, dispersion,
cross-terms, etc.). The method is illustrated for the superposition of
power-laws, free-free spectra, gray-body and modified blackbody spectra, but
can be applied to more complicated fundamental spectral energy distributions.
Here, we focus on intensity signals but the method can be extended to the case
of polarized emission. The averaging process automatically produces
scale-dependent spectral shapes and the moment method can be used to propagate
the required information across scales in power spectrum estimates. The
approach is not limited to applications to CMB foregrounds but could also be
useful for the modeling of X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies.

number of spatial dimensions. The only assumptions are that the interactions
have finite range. The finite-volume correction is a sum of contributions from
all possible breakup channels. In the case where the separation is into two
bound clusters, our result gives the leading volume dependence up to
exponentially small corrections. If the separation is into three or more
clusters, there is a power-law factor that is beyond the scope of this work,
however our result again determines the leading exponential dependence. We also
present two independent methods that use finite-volume data to determine
asymptotic normalization coefficients. The coefficients are useful to determine
low-energy capture reactions into weakly bound states relevant for nuclear
astrophysics. Using the techniques introduced here, one can even extract the
infinite-volume energy limit using data from a single-volume calculation. The
derived relations are tested using several exactly solvable systems and
numerical examples. We anticipate immediate applications to lattice
calculations of hadronic, nuclear, and cold atomic systems.

rotationally symmetric systems for which the control stabilizes the whole orbit

these results, we derive a threshold on the density of the eavesdroppers below
which no secrecy enhancing technique is required to ensure a target secrecy

deep neural network that allows selective execution. Given an input, only a
subset of D2NN neurons are executed, and the particular subset is determined by
the D2NN itself. By pruning unnecessary computation depending on input, D2NNs
provide a way to improve computational efficiency. To achieve dynamic selective
execution, a D2NN augments a feed-forward deep neural network (directed acyclic
graph of differentiable modules) with controller modules. Each controller
module is a sub-network whose output is a decision that controls whether other
modules can execute. A D2NN is trained end to end. Both regular and controller
modules in a D2NN are learnable and are jointly trained to optimize both
accuracy and efficiency. Such training is achieved by integrating
backpropagation with reinforcement learning. With extensive experiments of
various D2NN architectures on image classification tasks, we demonstrate that
D2NNs are general and flexible, and can effectively optimize
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

stellar tidal disruptions by rotating massive black holes. It combines an exact
relativistic description of the hydrodynamical evolution of a test fluid in a
fixed curved spacetime with a Newtonian treatment of the fluid's self-gravity.
Explicit expressions for the equations of motion are derived for Kerr spacetime
using two different coordinate systems. We implement the new methodology within
an existing Newtonian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code and show that
including the additional physics involves very little extra computational cost.
We carefully explore the validity of the novel approach by first testing its
ability to recover geodesic motion, and then by comparing the outcome of tidal
disruption simulations against previous relativistic studies. We further
compare simulations in Boyer--Lindquist and Kerr--Schild coordinates and
conclude that our approach allows accurate simulation even of tidal disruption
events where the star penetrates deeply inside the tidal radius of a rotating
black hole. Finally, we use the new method to study the effect of the black
hole spin on the morphology and fallback rate of the debris streams resulting
from tidal disruptions, finding that while the spin has little effect on the
fallback rate, it does imprint heavily on the stream morphology, and can even
be a determining factor in the survival or disruption of the star itself. Our
methodology is discussed in detail as a reference for future astrophysical
applications.

procedures in a general Bayesian framework when a closed form expression of the
marginal likelihood function is not available or a local asymptotic quadratic
approximation of the log-likelihood function does not exist. Under appropriate
identifiability assumptions on the true model, we provide sufficient conditions
for a Bayesian model selection procedure to be consistent and obey the Occam's
razor phenomenon, i.e., the probability of selecting the ""smallest"" model that
contains the truth tends to one as the sample size goes to infinity. In order
to show that a Bayesian model selection procedure selects the smallest model
containing the truth, we impose a prior anti-concentration condition, requiring
the prior mass assigned by large models to a neighborhood of the truth to be
sufficiently small. In a more general setting where the strong model
identifiability assumption may not hold, we introduce the notion of local
Bayesian complexity and develop oracle inequalities for Bayesian model
selection procedures. Our Bayesian oracle inequality characterizes a trade-off
between the approximation error and a Bayesian characterization of the local
complexity of the model, illustrating the adaptive nature of averaging-based
Bayesian procedures towards achieving an optimal rate of posterior convergence.
Specific applications of the model selection theory are discussed in the
context of high-dimensional nonparametric regression and density regression
where the regression function or the conditional density is assumed to depend
on a fixed subset of predictors. As a result of independent interest, we
propose a general technique for obtaining upper bounds of certain small ball

Effelsberg 100-m telescope. HC3N(J=24-23) was observed in nine galaxies with
the 10-m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). Results. HC3 N 2-1 is detected in three
galaxies: IC 342, M 66 and NGC 660 (> 3 {\sigma}). HC3 N 24-23 is detected in
three galaxies: IC 342, NGC 1068 and IC 694. This is the first measurements of
HC3N 2-1 in a relatively large sample of external galaxies, although the
detection rate is low. For the HC3 N 2-1 non-detections, upper limits (2
{\sigma}) are derived for each galaxy, and stacking the non-detections is
attempted to recover the weak signal of HC3N. But the stacked spectrum does not
show any significant signs of HC3N 2-1 emission. The results are also compared
with other transitions of HC3N observed in galaxies. Conclusions. The low
detection rate of both transitions suggests low abundance of HC3N in galaxies,
which is consistent with other observational studies. The comparison between
HC3N and HCN or HCO+shows a large diversity in the ratios between HC3N and HCN

straightforward, mainly because Faraday spectrum is complicated due to
turbulent magnetic field; it ruins the one-to-one relation between the Faraday

Faraday spectrum. In this paper, employing ""simple toy models"" for the magnetic
field, we describe numerically as well as analytically the characteristic
properties of Faraday spectrum. We show that Faraday spectrum along ""multiple

Specifically, considering face-on spiral galaxies and modeling turbulent
magnetic field as a random field with single coherence length, we numerically
calculate Faraday spectrum along a number of LOSs and its shape-characterizing
parameters, that is, the moments. When multiple LOSs cover a region of $\gtrsim
(10\ {\rm coherence\ length)^2}$, the shape of Faraday spectrum becomes smooth
and the shape-characterizing parameters are well specified. With the Faraday
spectrum constructed as a sum of Gaussian functions with different means and
variances, we analytically show that the parameters are expressed in terms of
the regular and turbulent components of LOS magnetic field and the coherence
length. We also consider the turbulent magnetic field modeled with power-law
spectrum, and study how the magnetic field is revealed in Faraday spectrum. Our

wavelengths between 0.5 and 1 $\mu$m due to molecular absorption, the addition
of a sulfur haze boosts the albedo there to $\sim$0.7 due to scattering. Strong
absorption by the haze shortward of 0.4 $\mu$m results in albedos $<$0.1, in
contrast to the high albedos produced by Rayleigh scattering in a clear
atmosphere. As a result, the color of the planet shifts from blue to orange.
The existence of a sulfur haze masks the molecular signatures of methane and
water, thereby complicating the characterization of atmospheric composition.
Detection of such a haze by WFIRST is possible, though discriminating between a
sulfur haze and any other highly reflective, high altitude scatterer will
require observations shortward of 0.4 $\mu$m, which is currently beyond
WFIRST's design.

which are introduced in the literature as an extension of SM to explain these

non-standard interaction (NSI) between the elementary particles. In this paper,
we consider a model with an additional $Z'$ boson (which is quite successful in
explaining the observed LFU anomalies) and analyze its effect in the lepton
flavour violating (LFV) $B_d\to \tau^\pm e^\mp$ decay modes. From the present
upper bound of the $B_d\to \tau^\pm e^\mp$ branching ratio, we obtain the
constraints on the new physics parameters, which are related to the
corresponding NSI parameters in the neutrino sector by $SU(2)_L$ symmetry.
These new parameters are expected to have potential implications in the
neutrino oscillation studies and in this work we investigate the possibility of
observing the effects of these interactions in the currently running and
upcoming long-baseline experiments, i.e., NOvA and DUNE respectively.

solutions to complex cognitive problems, sometimes even outperforming a single
expert. The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the
judgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer.
A large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the
literature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the
majority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a
novel approach for aggregating judgments - the transmission chain - which has
not yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence.
In a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective
solution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the
collective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members.
We address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster
collective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical
simulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the
transmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the
structure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to
those of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we
rely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary
decisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods
empirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has
the best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the
transmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those
that have cumulative properties.

(GFS) ensure data availability and durability using replication. This paper is
focused on the analysis of the efficiency of replication mechanism that
determines the location of the copies of a given file at some server. The
variability of the loads of the nodes of the network is investigated for
several policies. Three replication mechanisms are tested against simulations
in the context of a real implementation of a such a system: Random, Least
Loaded and Power of Choice.
  The simulations show that some of these policies may lead to quite unbalanced
situations: if $\beta$ is the average number of copies per node it turns out
that, at equilibrium, the load of the nodes may exhibit a high variability. It
is shown in this paper that a simple variant of a power of choice type
algorithm has a striking effect on the loads of the nodes: at equilibrium, the
distribution of the load of a node has a bounded support, most of nodes have a
load less than $2\beta$ which is an interesting property for the design of the
storage space of these systems.
  Mathematical models are introduced and investigated to explain this
interesting phenomenon. The analysis of these systems turns out to be quite
complicated mainly because of the large dimensionality of the state spaces
involved. Our study relies on probabilistic methods, mean-field analysis, to
analyze the asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary node of the network when the
total number of nodes gets large. An additional ingredient is the use of
stochastic calculus with marked Poisson point processes to establish some of
our results.

reconnection from fast temporarily magnetized winds from OB-supergiant. If a

semiclassical gravity. The fact that, in semiclassical gravity, superposed
states must share a common classical spacetime geometry, even if they prefer
(according to general relativity) differently curved spacetimes, leads to
energy increases of the states, when their mass distributions are different. If
one interprets these energy increases divided by Planck's constant as decay
rates of the states, one obtains the lifetimes of superpositions according to
the Diosi-Penrose criterion and reduction probabilities according to Born's
rule. The derivation of Born's rule for two-state superpositions can be adapted
to the typical quantum mechanical experiments with the help of a common
property of these experiments. It is that they lead to never more than two
different mass distributions at one location referring e.g. to the cases that a
particle ""is"", or ""is not"", detected at the location. From the characteristic
energy of the Diosi-Penrose criterion, an action is constructed whose
relativistic generalisation becomes obvious by a decomposition of the
Einstein-Hilbert action to the superposed states. In Part 2, semiclassical
gravity is enhanced to the so-called Dynamical Spacetime approach to
wavefunction collapse, which leads to a physical mechanism for collapse.

quantum superpositions is developed, which takes the solid's microscopic mass
distribution (resulting from its nuclei) and its macroscopic shape into
account, where the solid's states can differ by slightly different positions or
extensions of the solid. For small displacements, smaller than the spatial
variation of the solid's nuclei, the characteristic energy of the Diosi-Penrose
criterion is mainly determined by the mass distribution of the nuclei. For
large displacements, much larger than the solid's lattice constant, the solid
can be idealised as a continuum, and the characteristic energy depends on the
solid's shape and the direction of the displacement. In Diosi's approach, in
which the mass density operator has to be smeared, the solid's microscopic mass
distribution plays no role. The results are applied to a special single-photon
avalanche photodiode detector, which interacts as little as possible with its
environment. This is realised by disconnecting the detector from the
measurement devices when it is in a superposition, and by biasing the
photodiode by a plate capacitor, which is charged shortly before the photon's
arrival. For a suitable choice of components, the detector can stay in a
superposition for seconds; its lifetime can be shortened to microseconds with
the help of a piezoactuator, which displaces a mass in the case of photon
detection.

collapse is proposed. The Dynamical Spacetime approach predicts deviations from
Born's rule, when a solid evolves into a three-state superposition, and when
the displacement between the superposed states is, at the reduction point in
time, significantly larger than the spatial variation of the solids nuclei,
being typically on the order of a tenth of an Angstroem. The solid is brought
into the three-state superposition by splitting a photon into three beams and
by detecting it in each beam by avalanche photodiodes, which displace the solid
at different distances with the help of a piezoactuator. The challenge of the
experiment is the precise prediction of the setup's reduction point in time to
ensure a sufficient separation between the states at this point in time. This
is addressed by avoiding interactions of the setup with the environment during
superposition, and by a precise calculation of the setup's reduction point in
time with the help of a formulary for the Diosi-Penrose criterion for solids in
quantum superpositions. Since the measurement of reduction probabilities is not
disturbed by state decoherence, the experiment can be performed at room
temperature. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that the predicted increase
of the reduction probability of one state by a factor of 1.5 with respect to
Born's rule can be measured by a few hundred statistically significant
measurements.

properties of conformal blocks and in construction of knot polynomials.
However, in complicated cases the logic is actually inverted: they are much
better deduced from these applications than from the basic representation
theory. Following the recent proposal of arXiv:1612.00422, we obtain the
exclusive Racah matrix $\bar S$ for the currently-front-line case of
representation $R=[3,1]$ with non-trivial multiplicities, where it is actually
operator valued, i.e. depends on the choice of basises in the intertwiner
spaces. Effective field theory for arborescent knots in this case possesses
gauge invariance, which is not yet properly described and understood. Because
of this lack of knowledge a big part (about a half) of $\bar S$ needs to be
reconstructed from orthogonality conditions. Therefore we discuss the abundance
of symmetric orthogonal matrices, to which $\bar S$ belong, and explain that
dimension of their moduli space is also about a half of that for the ordinary
orthogonal matrices. Thus the knowledge approximately matches the freedom and
this explains why the method can work -- with some limited addition of educated
guesses. A similar calculation for $R=[r,1]$ for $r>3$ should also be doable.

identified bars are either bar--like structures or dead central regions in
which star formation is strongly suppressed. Similar morphologies are found in
the distribution of star formation directly traced by H$\alpha$ maps. The sizes
of such optical and infrared structures correlate remarkably well, hinting at a
causal connection. In the light of previous observations and of theoretical
investigations in the literature, we interpret our findings as further evidence
of the scenario in which bars drive strong inflows toward their host nuclei:
young bars are still in the process of perturbing the gas and star formation
clearly delineates the shape of the bars; old bars on the contrary already
removed any gas within their extents, carving a dead region of negligible star
formation.

millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless systems with large antenna arrays. We develop
a novel simultaneous-estimation with iterative fountain training (SWIFT)
framework, in which multiple users estimate their channels at the same time and
the required number of channel measurements is adapted to various channel
conditions of different users. To achieve this, we represent the beam direction
estimation process by a graph, referred to as the beam-on-graph, and associate
the channel estimation process with a code-on-graph decoding problem.
Specifically, the base station (BS) and each user measure the channel with a
series of random combinations of transmit/receive beamforming vectors until the
channel estimate converges. As the proposed SWIFT does not adapt the BS's beams
to any single user, we are able to estimate all user channels simultaneously.
Simulation results show that SWIFT can significantly outperform the existing
random beamforming-based approaches, which use a predetermined number of
measurements, over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and channel coherence
time. Furthermore, by utilizing the users' order in terms of completing their
channel estimation, our SWIFT framework can infer the sequence of users'
channel quality and perform effective user scheduling to achieve superior
performance.

in resonance with Jupiter are comprised of objects scattered inward from the
outer Solar System during a period of dynamical instability. In this paper, we
present a new analysis of the absolute magnitude and optical color distribution
of Hilda asteroids, which lie in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter,
with the goal of comparing the bulk properties with previously published
results from an analogous study of Jupiter Trojans. We report an updated power
law fit of the Hilda magnitude distribution through H=14. Using photometric
data listed in the Sloan Moving Object Catalog, we confirm the
previously-reported strong bimodality in visible spectral slope distribution,
indicative of two sub-populations with differing surface compositions. When
considering collisional families separately, we find that collisional fragments
follow a unimodal color distribution with spectral slope values consistent with
the bluer of the two sub-populations. The color distributions of Hildas and
Trojans are comparable and consistent with a scenario in which the color
bimodality in both populations developed prior to emplacement into their
present-day locations. We propose that the shallower magnitude distribution of
the Hildas is a result of an initially much larger Hilda population, which was
subsequently depleted as smaller bodies were preferentially ejected from the
narrow 3:2 resonance via collisions. Altogether, these observations provide a
strong case supporting a common origin for Hildas and Trojans as predicted by
current dynamical instability theories of Solar System evolution.

with extragalactic background light (EBL) photons to produce electron-positron
pairs, which then interact with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons via
inverse-Compton scattering to produce gamma rays. Due to the deflection of the
electron-positron pairs, a non-zero intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) would
potentially produce detectable effects on the angular distribution of the
cascade emission. In particular, an angular broadening compared to the
unscattered emission could occur. Through non-detection of angularly broadened

sites hybridize with each other in ways that produce nontrivial band topology,
and the search for material systems to realize such phases have been strongly
influenced by this. Here we theoretically demonstrate topological insulators in
systems with a random distribution of sites in space, i. e., a random lattice.
This is achieved by constructing hopping models on random lattices whose ground
states possess nontrivial topological nature (characterized e. g., by Bott
indices) that manifests as quantized conductances in systems with a boundary.
By tuning parameters such as the density of sites (for a given range of fermion
hopping), we can achieve transitions from trivial to topological phases. We
discuss interesting features of these transitions. In two spatial dimensions,
we show this for all five symmetry classes (A, AII, D, DIII and C) that are
known to host nontrivial topology in crystalline systems. We expect similar
physics to be realizable in any dimension and provide an explicit example of a
$Z_2$ topological insulator on a random lattice in three spatial dimensions.
Our study not only provides a deeper understanding of the topological phases of
non-interacting fermions, but also suggests new directions in the pursuit of
the laboratory realization of topological quantum matter.

reduce the interference signal dimensions and thus achieve the optimal capacity
scaling, i.e. degrees of freedom, promised by the interference alignment
technique. However, imperfect CSI, due to channel estimation error, imperfect
CSI feedback and time selectivity of the channel, lead to a performance loss.
In this work, we propose a novel limited feedback algorithm for single-input
single-output interference alignment in time-variant channels. The feedback
algorithm encodes the channel evolution in a small number of subspace
coefficients, which allow for reduced-rank channel prediction to compensate for
the channel estimation error due to time selectivity of the fading process and
feedback delay. An upper bound for the rate loss caused by feedback
quantization and channel prediction is derived. Based on this bound, we develop
a dimension switching algorithm for the reduced-rank predictor to find the best
tradeoff between quantization- and prediction-error. Besides, we characterize
the scaling of the required number of feedback bits in order to decouple the
rate loss due to channel quantization from the transmit power. Simulation
results show that a rate gain over the traditional non-predictive feedback
strategy can be secured and a 60% higher rate is achieved at 20 dB

function corresponding to a total Hamiltonian with Rashba and radiation terms.
We consider a perturbation treatment for elastic scattering due to charged
impurities to finally obtain the magnetoresistance of the system. Without
radiation we recover a beating pattern in the amplitude of the Shubnikov de
Hass oscillations: a set of nodes and antinodes in the magnetoresistance. In
the presence of radiation this beating pattern is strongly modified following
the profile of radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations. We study their
dependence on intensity and frequency of radiation, including the teraherzt
regime.

that populate the N-dimensional space as a density distribution, especially
informative when the neural dynamics performs a noisy path through metastable
states (often a case of interest in neuroscience); this makes clustering in the
N-dimensional space a natural choice. We apply a variant of the 'mean-shift'
algorithm to perform such clustering, and validate it on an Hopfield network in
the glassy phase, in which metastable states are uncorrelated from memory
attractors. The neural states identified as clusters' centroids are then used
to define a parsimonious parametrization of the synaptic matrix, which allows a
significant improvement in inferring the synaptic couplings from neural
activities. We next consider the more realistic case of a multi-modular spiking
network, with spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) inducing history-dependent
effects; we develop a procedure, inspired by Boltzmann learning but extending
its domain of application, to learn inter-module synaptic couplings so that the
spiking network reproduces a prescribed pattern of spatial correlations. After
clustering the activity generated by multi-modular spiking networks, we
represent their multi-dimensional dynamics as the symbolic sequence of the
clusters' centroids, which naturally lends itself to complexity estimates that
provide information on memory effects like those induced by SFA. To obtain a
relative complexity measure we compare the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the actual
centroid sequence to the one of Markov processes sharing the same transition
probabilities between centroids; as an illustration, we show that the

naturally in solving PDE's for particle interaction with the Fast Multi-pole
Method (FMM), or computing generalized eigenvalues. From these application
fields, structured representations and algorithms have been designed in
numerical linear algebra to compute with these matrices in time linear in the

However, all existing benchmarks or evaluation frameworks produce static access

Hence, we have proposed the Dynamic Evaluation Framework (DEF) that simulates

designed to be open and fully extensible (e.g., new access pattern change
models can be added easily). In this paper, we instantiate DEF into the Dynamic

simulating the execution of four different dynamic clustering algorithms. The
results confirm our analysis that flexible conservative re-clustering is the
key in determining a clustering algorithm's ability to adapt to changes in

adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern

spectral properties of correlated electrons reliable in the strong-coupling
limit. We introduce an effective interaction determined self-consistently from
the reduced parquet equations. It is a static local approximation of the
two-particle irreducible vertex, the kernel of a potentially singular
Bethe-Salpeter equation. The effective interaction enters the Ward identity
from which a thermodynamic self-energy, renormalizing the one-electron
propagators, is determined. The dynamical Schwinger-Dyson equation with the
thermodynamic propagators is then used to calculate the spectral properties.
The thermodynamic and spectral properties of correlated electrons are in this
way determined on the same footing and in a consistent manner. Such a
mean-field approximation is analytically controllable and free of unphysical
behavior and spurious phase transitions. We apply the construction to the
asymmetric Anderson impurity and the Hubbard models in the strong-coupling
regime.

computer graphics (CG) generated data is not yet effective due to the concept
of 'domain-shift' between virtual and real data. Although simulated data
augmented with a few real world samples has been shown to mitigate domain shift
and improve transferability of trained models, guiding or bootstrapping the
virtual data generation with the distributions learnt from target real world
domain is desired, especially in the fields where annotating even few real
images is laborious (such as semantic labeling, and intrinsic images etc.). In
order to address this problem in an unsupervised manner, our work combines
recent advances in CG (which aims to generate stochastic scene layouts coupled
with large collections of 3D object models) and generative adversarial training
(which aims train generative models by measuring discrepancy between generated
and real data in terms of their separability in the space of a deep
discriminatively-trained classifier). Our method uses iterative estimation of
the posterior density of prior distributions for a generative graphical model.
This is done within a rejection sampling framework. Initially, we assume
uniform distributions as priors on the parameters of a scene described by a
generative graphical model. As iterations proceed the prior distributions get
updated to distributions that are closer to the (unknown) distributions of
target data. We demonstrate the utility of adversarially tuned scene generation
on two real-world benchmark datasets (CityScapes and CamVid) for traffic scene
semantic labeling with a deep convolutional net (DeepLab). We realized
performance improvements by 2.28 and 3.14 points (using the IoU metric) between

the strong sensitivity of the system to the experimental conditions and in

incident with $v$ (in order), where the inverse is taken for any edge leaving
$v$. Write $\chi = \sum_{\lambda}m_{\lambda}\chi_{\lambda}$, where the sum runs
over irreducible representations $\lambda$ of $G$ with character
$\chi_{\lambda}$ and with $m_{\lambda} \in \mathbb{C}$ for every $\lambda$. If
$H$ is connected, it is proved that $P_{\chi}(H) =
|G|^{|E|}\sum_{\lambda}\chi_{\lambda}(1)^{|F|-|E|}m_{\lambda}^{|V|}$, where $1$
is the identity element of $G$. Among the corollaries, a formula for the number
of nowhere-identity $G$-flows on $H$ is derived, generalizing a result of
Tutte. We show that these flows correspond bijectively to certain proper
$G$-colorings of a covering graph of the dual graph of $H$. This correspondence
generalizes coloring-flow duality for planar graphs.

  Visual binaries are the most numerous observed binaries, the number of pairs
exceeds 130000. The most complete list of presently known visual binary stars
was compiled by cross-matching objects and combining data of the three largest
catalogues of visual binaries. It was supplemented by the data on parallaxes,
multicolor photometry, spectral characteristics of the stars of this list taken
from other catalogues. This allowed us to compensate partly for the lack of
observational data for these objects. Combined data allowed us to check
validity of observational values and to investigate statistics of the orbital
and physical parameters of visual binaries. Corrections for incompleteness of
observational data are discussed. Obtained datasets and modern distributions of
binary parameters will be used to reconstruct the initial distributions and
parameters of the function of star formation for binary systems.

used in enzyme simulation. Over ten convergence studies of QM/MM methods have
revealed over the past several years that key energetic and structural
properties approach asymptotic limits with only very large (ca. 500-1000 atom)
QM regions. This slow convergence has been observed to be due in part to
significant charge transfer between the core active site and surrounding
protein environment, which cannot be addressed by improvement of MM force
fields or the embedding method employed within QM/MM. Given this slow
convergence, it becomes essential to identify strategies for the most
atom-economical determination of optimal QM regions and to gain insight into
the crucial interactions captured only in large QM regions. Here, we extend and
develop two methods for quantitative determination of QM regions. First, in the
charge shift analysis (CSA) method, we probe the reorganization of electron
density when core active site residues are removed completely, as determined by
large-QM region QM/MM calculations. Second, we introduce the
highly-parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA), which identifies how
core/substrate frontier states are altered by the presence of an additional QM
residue on smaller initial QM regions. We demonstrate that the FSA and CSA
approaches are complementary and consistent on three test case enzymes:
catechol O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450cam, and hen eggwhite lysozyme. We
also introduce validation strategies and test sensitivities of the two methods
to geometric structure, basis set size, and electronic structure methodology.
Both methods represent promising approaches for the systematic, unbiased
determination of quantum mechanical effects in enzymes and large systems that
necessitate multi-scale modeling.

minimally coupled to an arbitrary (current-free) nonlinear Lagrangian of
electrodynamics (NLED) in the slow rotation regime $a\ll M$ (black hole's
mass), up to first order in $a/M$. We then make use of the robust and
self-contained Born-Infeld Lagrangian in order to compare and contrast the
physical properties of such NLED spacetime with its Maxwellian counterpart (a
slowly rotating Kerr-Newman spacetime), especially focusing on the astrophysics
of both neutrino flavor oscillations ($\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$)
and spin-flip ($\nu_l \rightarrow \nu_r$, ""$l$"" stands for ""left"" and ""$r$""
stands for ""right"", change of neutrino handedness) mass level-crossings, the
equivalent to gyroscopic precessions. Such analysis proves that in the
spacetime of a slowly rotating nonlinear charged black hole (RNCBH),
intrinsically associated with the assumption the electromagnetism is nonlinear,
the neutrino dynamics in core-collapse supernovae could be significantly
changed. In such astrophysical environment a positive enhancement (reduction of
the electron fraction $Y_e<0.5$) of the r-process may take place. Consequently,
it might result in hyperluminous supernova explosions due to enlargement, in
atomic number and amount, of the decaying nuclides. Finally, we envisage some
physical scenarios that may lead to short-lived charged black holes with high
charge-to-mass ratios (associated with unstable highly magnetized neutron
stars) and ways to possibly disentangle theories of the electromagnetism from
other black holes observables (by means of light polarization measurements).

matter-energy density which does counter balance the repulsive force from the
interior whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum assumed to be de
Sitter spacetime which can be described by the generalized Schwarzschild
solution. With this specification we find out a set of exact and non-singular
solutions of the gravastar which seems physically very interesting and
reasonable.

terms of exact ray-trajectories (encoded in the structure itself of
Helmholtz-like equations) whose mutual coupling is the one and only cause of
any diffraction and interference process. In the case of Wave Mechanics, de
Broglie's merging of Maupertuis's and Fermat's principles (see Section 3)
provides, without resorting to the probability-based guidance-laws and
flow-lines of the Bohmian theory, the simple law addressing particles along the
Helmholtz rays of the relevant matter waves. The purpose of the present
research was to derive the exact Hamiltonian ray-trajectory systems concerning,
respectively, classical electromagnetic waves, non-relativistic matter waves
and relativistic matter waves. We faced then, as a typical example, the
numerical solution of non-relativistic wave-mechanical equation systems in a
number of numerical applications, showing that each particle turns out to
""dances a wave-mechanical dance"" around its classical trajectory, to which it
reduces when the ray-coupling is neglected. Our approach reaches the double
goal of a clear insight into the mechanism of wave-particle duality and of a
reasonably simple computability. We finally compared our exact dynamical
approach, running as close as possible to Classical Mechanics, with the
hydrodynamic Bohmian theory, based on fluid-like ""guidance laws"".

  spacetime","References update",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A gravity-induced approach to wavefunction collapse based on semiclassical
gravity is enhanced by the hypothesis of a temporally expanding spacetime,
which leads to a collapse model that can resolve the conflict between quantum
nonlocality and relativity. It is postulated that the spacetime region on which
the evolution of the state vector exists is bounded towards the future by a
border that is dynamically moving towards the future, and at which the state
vector must fulfil a boundary condition. Wavefunction collapse is represented
in such a way that the evolution of the state vector changes abruptly at
critical spacetime expansions to an evolution resembling a classical
trajectory. This can explain the correlations in EPR experiments without coming
into conflict with relativity, since the evolution of the state vector before
and after the abrupt change is governed solely by local physical laws. This
model leads to the same lifetimes of superpositions as the gravity-based
approaches of Diosi and Penrose, and is characterised by the facts that energy
is conserved at collapse and that the reduction point in time does not vary
statistically. Some unique features of the model are that it naturally leads to
stochastic behaviour and that it can predict reduction probabilities. It
explains why all experiments performed so far behave in agreement with Born's
rule, due to a property that they have in common. This gives rise to new
experiments for checking Born's rule, which can be realised in the short term.

describe the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic films with three to twenty
spin layers for the first time. Previously, the solution of second order
perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian was found for ferromagnetic films with two to
five layers under some assumptions by us. In this report, the exact solution is
presented without any assumptions by calculating the pseudo inverse of matrix
C. All eight magnetic parameters such as spin exchange interaction, second
order magnetic anisotropy, fourth order magnetic anisotropy, stress induced
magnetic anisotropy, demagnetization factor, in plane magnetic field, out of
plane magnetic field and magnetic dipole interaction were taken into account.
The easy and hard directions were found using 3-D and 2-D plots of total
magnetic energy versus these magnetic parameters. Angle between easy and hard
directions was nearly 107 degrees in many cases. The magnetic easy axis
gradually rotates from out of plane to in plane direction by indicating a
preferred in plane orientation of magnetic easy axis for films with higher
number of spin layers. These theoretical results agree with some experimental
research data of ferromagnetic thin films.
