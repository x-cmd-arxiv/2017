physical variables is developed for the numerical solution of one-dimensional
elastic-plastic flows with the Mie-Gr\""{u}neisen equation of state, the Wilkins
constitutive model, and the von Mises yielding criterion. The scheme combines
the Lagrangian method with the MMPDE moving mesh method and adaptively moves
the mesh to better resolve shock and other types of waves while preventing the
mesh from crossing and tangling. It can be viewed as a direct arbitrarily
Lagrangian-Eulerian method but can also be degenerated to a purely Lagrangian
scheme. It treats the relative velocity of the fluid with respect to the mesh
as constant in time between time steps, which allows high-order approximation
of free boundaries. A time dependent scaling is used in the monitor function to
avoid possible sudden movement of the mesh points due to the creation or
diminishing of shock and rarefaction waves or the steepening of those waves. A
two-rarefaction Riemann solver with elastic waves is employed to compute the
Godunov values of the density, pressure, velocity, and deviatoric stress at
cell interfaces. Numerical results are presented for three examples. The
third-order convergence of the scheme and its ability to concentrate mesh
points around shock and elastic rarefaction waves are demonstrated. The
obtained numerical results are in good agreement with those in literature. The
new scheme is also shown to be more accurate in resolving shock and rarefaction
waves than an existing third-order cell-centered Lagrangian scheme.

which reproduces the background expansion of $\Lambda$CDM with no need of a
cosmological constant nor of any dimensional constant beside Newton's one. A
previous analysis based on redshift-space distortions (RSD) data concluded that
the model was ruled out. In this work we revisit the issue and find that, when
recast in a localized model, the DW model is not ruled out and actually gives a
better fit to RSD data than $\Lambda$CDM. At the same time, the model predicts
a slightly lower value of $\sigma_{8}$ than $\Lambda$CDM, in agreement with
recent estimates based on lensing. We also produce analytical approximations of
the two modified gravity functions and of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ as a function of
redshift. Finally, we also show how much the fit depends on initial conditions
when these are generalized with respect to a standard matter-dominated era.

sensitive nature of much of the data that are daily exchanged or released to
untrusted parties requires that responsible organizations undertake appropriate
privacy protection measures. Nowadays, much of these data are texts (e.g.,
emails, messages posted in social media, healthcare outcomes, etc.) that,
because of their unstructured and semantic nature, constitute a challenge for
automatic data protection methods. In fact, textual documents are usually
protected manually, in a process known as document redaction or sanitization.
To do so, human experts identify sensitive terms (i.e., terms that may reveal
identities and/or confidential information) and protect them accordingly (e.g.,
via removal or, preferably, generalization). To relieve experts from this
burdensome task, in a previous work we introduced the theoretical basis of
C-sanitization, an inherently semantic privacy model that provides the basis to
the development of automatic document redaction/sanitization algorithms and
offers clear and a priori privacy guarantees on data protection; even though
its potential benefits C-sanitization still presents some limitations when
applied to practice (mainly regarding flexibility, efficiency and accuracy). In
this paper, we propose a new more flexible model, named (C, g(C))-sanitization,
which enables an intuitive configuration of the trade-off between the desired
level of protection (i.e., controlled information disclosure) and the
preservation of the utility of the protected data (i.e., amount of semantics to
be preserved). Moreover, we also present a set of technical solutions and
algorithms that provide an efficient and scalable implementation of the model
and improve its practical accuracy, as we also illustrate through empirical
experiments.

special relativity, and has been tested to great level of detail. However,
theories of quantum gravity at the Planck scale indicate that Lorentz symmetry
may be broken at that scale motivating further tests. While the Planck energy
is currently unreachable by experiment, tiny residual effects at attainable
energies can become measurable when photons propagate over sufficiently large
distances. The Standard-Model Extension (SME) is an effective field theory
approach to describe low-energy effects of quantum gravity theories. Lorentz
and CPT symmetry violating effects are introduced by adding additional terms to
the Standard Model Lagrangian. These terms can be ordered by the mass dimension
of the corresponding operator, and the leading terms of interest have dimension
d = 5. Effects of these operators are a linear variation of the speed of light
with photon energy, and a rotation of the linear polarization of photons
quadratic in photon energy, as well as anisotropy. We analyzed optical
polarization data from 72 AGN and GRBs and derived the first set of limits on
all 16 coefficients of mass dimension d = 5 of the SME photon sector. Our
constraints imply a lower limit on the energy scale of quantum gravity of
$10^6$ times the Planck energy, severly limiting the phase space for any theory

around which spin locks to momentum. The remnant of the Dirac cone is
hybridized with evanescent wave functions injected by metallic layers and
pushed, due to charge transfer from Co or Cu layers, few tenths of eV below
$E_F^0$ for both Bi$_2$Se$_3$/Co and Bi$_2$Se$_3$/Cu interfaces while hosting
distorted helical spin texture wounding around a single circle. These features
explain recent observation [K. Kondou {\em et al.}, Nat. Phys. {\bf 12}, 1027

well as in-plane spin textures signifying the spin-orbit proximity effect. We
predict that out-of-plane tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance in vertical
heterostructure Cu/Bi$_2$Se$_3$/Co, where current flowing perpendicular to its

noted that the vacuum angle theta(EW), associated with the electroweak SU(2) in

old craters are erased, such that the total number of observable impacts
remains constant. Despite substantial efforts to understand this process, there
remain many unsolved problems. Here, we propose an analytical model that
describes how a heavily cratered surface reaches a state of crater count
equilibrium. The proposed model formulates three physical processes
contributing to crater count equilibrium: cookie-cutting (simple, geometric
overlap), ejecta-blanketing, and sandblasting (diffusive erosion). These three
processes are modeled using a degradation parameter that describes the
efficiency for a new crater to erase old craters. The flexibility of our newly
developed model allows us to represent the processes that underlie crater count
equilibrium problems. The results show that when the slope of the production
function is steeper than that of the equilibrium state, the power law of the
equilibrium slope is independent of that of the production function slope. We
apply our model to the cratering conditions in the Sinus Medii region and at
the Apollo 15 landing site on the Moon and demonstrate that a consistent
degradation parameterization can successfully be determined based on the
empirical results of these regions. Further developments of this model will
enable us to better understand the surface evolution of airless bodies due to

accreting compact binary systems exhibit outbursts, during which their
luminosity increases by orders of magnitude. The DIM correctly predicts which
systems should be transient and works regardless of whether the accretor is a
black hole, a neutron star or a white dwarf. However, it has been known for
some time that the outbursts of X-ray binaries (which contain neutron-star or
black-hole accretors) exhibit hysteresis in the X-ray hardness-intensity
diagram (HID). More recently, it has been shown that the outbursts of accreting
white dwarfs also show hysteresis, but in a diagram combining optical, EUV and
X-ray fluxes.
  Aims. We examine here the nature of the hysteresis observed in cataclysmic
variables and low-mass X-ray binaries.
  Methods. We use the Hameury et al. (1998) code for modelling dwarf nova
outbursts, and construct the hardness intensity diagram as predicted by the
disc instability model.
  Results. We show explicitly that the standard DIM - modified only to account
for disc truncation - can explain the hysteresis observed in accreting white
dwarfs, but cannot explain that observed in X-ray binaries.
  Conclusions. The spectral evidence for the existence of different accretion
regimes / components (disc, corona, jets, etc.) should be based only on
wavebands that are specific to the innermost parts of the discs, i.e. EUV and
X-rays, which is a difficult task because of interstellar absorption. The
existing data, however, indicate that an EUV/X-ray hysteresis is present in SS
Cyg.

In this type of forgery, an area from the image copied, then after post

Copy-move forgery is to hide or duplicate one or more objects in the image.
Key-point based Copy-move forgery detection methods have five main steps:
preprocessing, feature extraction, matching, transform estimation and post
processing that matching and transform estimation have important effect on the
detection. More over the error could happens in some steps due to the noise.
The existing methods process these steps separately and in case of having an
error in a step, this error could be propagated to the following steps and
affects the detection. To solve the above mentioned problem, in this paper the
steps of the detection system interact with each other and if an error happens
in a step, following steps are trying to detect and solve it. We formulate this
interaction by defining and optimizing a cost function. This function includes
matching and transform estimation steps. Then in an iterative procedure the
steps are executed and in case of detecting error, the error will be corrected.

a clear dependence of the thin disc scale length, warp and flare shapes with

about 2 kpc for the oldest. The warp shows a complex structure, clearly
asymmetrical with a node angle changing with age from approximately 165 deg for
old stars to 195 deg for young stars. The outer disc is also flaring with a
scale height that varies by a factor of two between the solar neighbourhood and
a Galactocentric distance of 12 kpc. Conclusions. We conclude that the thin

one of the key performance metrics of a wireless cellular network. In this
paper, we propose a semi-analytical method based on saddle point approximation
(SPA) technique to calculate the SINR outage of a wireless system whose SINR
can be modeled in the form $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^M X_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i +1}$ where
$X_i$ denotes the useful signal power, $Y_i$ denotes the power of the
interference signal, and $\sum_{i=1}^M X_i$, $\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i$ are independent
random variables. Both $M$ and $N$ can also be random variables. The proposed
approach is based on the saddle point approximation to cumulative distribution
function (CDF) as given by \tit{Wood-Booth-Butler formula}. The approach is
applicable whenever the cumulant generating function (CGF) of the received
signal and interference exists, and it allows us to tackle distributions with
large skewness and kurtosis with higher accuracy. In this regard, we exploit a
four parameter \tit{normal-inverse Gaussian} (NIG) distribution as a base
distribution. Given that the skewness and kurtosis satisfy a specific
condition, NIG-based SPA works reliably. When this condition is violated, we
recommend SPA based on normal or symmetric NIG distribution, both special cases
of NIG distribution, at the expense of reduced accuracy. For the purpose of
demonstration, we apply SPA for the SINR outage evaluation of a typical user
experiencing a downlink coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) from the
base stations (BSs) that are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process. We
characterize the outage of the typical user in scenarios such as (a)~when the
number and locations of interferers are random, and (b)~when the fading
channels and number of interferers are random. Numerical results are presented
to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed set of approximations.

proposed for tunneling FETs (TFETs). Compared with single heterojunction (HJ)
TFETs, the 3HJ TFETs have both shorter tunneling distance and two transmission
resonances that significantly improve the ON-state current ($I_{\rm{ON}}$).
Coherent quantum transport simulation predicts, that $I_{\rm{ON}}=460\rm{\mu
A/\mu m}$ can be achieved at gate length $Lg=15\rm{nm}$, supply voltage
$V_{\rm{DD}}=0.3\rm{V}$, and OFF-state current $I_{\rm{OFF}}=1\rm{nA/\mu m}$.
However, strong electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering in the heavily
doped leads implies, that the 3HJ devices operate far from the ideal coherent
limit. In this study, such scattering effects are assessed by a newly developed
multiscale transport model, which combines the ballistic non-equilibrium
Green's function method for the channel and the drift-diffusion scattering
method for the leads. Simulation results show that the thermalizing scattering
in the leads both degrades the 3HJ TFET's subthreshold swing through scattering

our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix

overall computational complexity of our proposed algorithm, which is defined as
the iteration complexity times per iteration time complexity, is lower than the

populations of massive galaxies. NGC 7457 is a nearby, early-type galaxy with a
stellar luminosity of $1.7\times10^{10} L_{K\odot}$, allowing us to investigate
the populations in a relatively low mass galaxy. We classify the detected X-ray
sources into field LMXBs, globular cluster LMXBs, and background AGN based on
identifying optical counterparts in new HST/ACS images. We detect 10 field
LMXBs within the $r_{ext}$ ellipse of NGC 7457 (with semi-major axis $\sim$ 9.1
kpc, ellipticity = 0.55). The corresponding number of LMXBs with
$L_{x}>2\times10^{37}erg/s$ per stellar luminosity is consistent with that
observed in more massive galaxies, $\sim 7$ per $10^{10} L_{K\odot}$. We detect
a small globular cluster population in these HST data and show that its colour
distribution is likely bimodal and that its specific frequency is similar to
that of other early type galaxies. However, no X-ray emission is detected from
any of these clusters. Using published data for other galaxies, we show that
this non-detection is consistent with the small stellar mass of these clusters.
We estimate that 0.11 (and 0.03) LMXBs are expected per $10^{6}M_{\odot}$ in
metal-rich (and metal-poor) globular clusters. This corresponds to 1100 (and
330) LMXBs per $10^{10} L_{K\odot}$, highlighting the enhanced formation
efficiency of LMXBs in globular clusters. A nuclear X-ray source is detected
with $L_{x}$ varying from $2.8-6.8\times10^{38}erg/s$. Combining this $L_{x}$
with a published dynamical mass estimate for the central SMBH in NGC 7457, we
find that $L_{x}/L_{Edd}$ varies from $0.5-1.3\times10^{-6}$.

as the explanation of the Mont Blanc burst. It is shown that the Mont Blanc
burst is consistent with the distinctive signature of that explanation i.e., an
8 MeV antineutrino line from SN 1987A. It is further shown that a model of core
collapse supernovae involving dark matter particles of mass 8 MeV would in fact
yield an 8 MeV antineutrino line. Moreover, that dark matter model predicts 8
MeV $\nu,\bar{\nu}$ and $e^+e^-$ pairs from the galactic center, a place where
one would expect large amounts of dark matter to collect. The resulting $e^+$
would create $\gamma-$rays from the galactic center, and a fit to MeV
$\gamma-$ray data yields the model's dark matter mass, as well as the
calculated source temperature and angular size. More direct support comes from
the spectrum of $N\sim1000$ events recorded by the Kamiokande-II detector on
the day of SN 1987A, which appear to show an 8 MeV line atop the detector
background. This $\bar{\nu}$ line, if genuine, has been well-hidden for 30
years because it occurs very close to the peak of the background. This fact
might ordinarily justify extreme skepticism. In the present case, however, a
more positive view is called for based on (a) the very high statistical
significance of the result $(30 \sigma),$ (b) the use of a detector background
independent of the SN 1987A data using a later K-II data set, and (c) the
observation of an excess above the background spectrum whose central energy and
width both agree with that of an 8 MeV $\bar{\nu}$ line broadened by $25\%$
resolution. Lastly, it is noted that the tachyonic interpretation of the Mont
Blanc burst fits the author's earlier unconventional $3+3$ model of the
neutrino mass states.

For heavier isotopes, such as barium, production through neutron capture is

detailed theoretical predictions for the resulting final $s$-process abundances
have important uncertainties caused both by the underlying uncertainties in the
nuclear physics (principally neutron capture reaction and $\beta$-decay rates)
as well as by the stellar evolution modeling. In this work, we investigated the
impact of nuclear-physics uncertainties relevant to the $s$-process in massive
stars. Using a Monte-Carlo based approach, we performed extensive nuclear
reaction network calculations that include newly evaluated upper and lower
limits for the individual temperature dependent reaction rates. We found that
most of the uncertainty in the final abundances is caused by uncertainties in
the neutron capture rates, while $\beta$-decay rate uncertainties affect only a
few nuclei near $s$-process branchings. The $s$-process in rotating metal-poor
stars shows quantitatively different uncertainties and key reactions, although
the qualitative characteristics are similar. We confirmed that our results do

neutrino mass patterns and mixing. These are the outcome of the interplay of
several features, namely: i) the seesaw mechanism; ii) the presence of an
intermediate scale where B-L gauge symmetry is broken and the right-handed
neutrinos acquire a Majorana mass; iii) a symmetric Dirac neutrino mass matrix
whose pattern is close to the up-type quark one. In this framework two natural
characteristics emerge. Normal neutrino mass hierarchy is the only allowed, and
there is an approximate relation involving both light-neutrino masses and
mixing parameters. This differs from what occurring when horizontal flavour
symmetries are invoked. In this case, in fact, neutrino mixing or mass
relations have been separately obtained in literature. In this paper we discuss
an example of such comprehensive mixing-mass relation in a specific realization
of SO(10) and, in particular, analyse its impact on the expected neutrinoless
double beta decay effective mass parameter $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$, and on the
neutrino mass scale. Remarkably a lower limit for the lightest neutrino mass is

contemporary techniques for characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres. The
measurements are difficult, because - even in current favorable cases - the
signals can be as small as 0.001-percent of the host star's flux. Consequently,
some early results have been illusory, and not confirmed by subsequent
investigations. Prominent illusions to date include polarized scattered light,
temperature inversions, and the existence of carbon planets. The field moves
from the first tentative and often incorrect conclusions, converging to the
reality of exoplanetary atmospheres. That reality is revealed using transits
for close-in exoplanets, and direct imaging for young or massive exoplanets in
distant orbits. Several atomic and molecular constituents have now been
robustly detected in exoplanets as small as Neptune. In our current
observations, the effects of clouds and haze appear ubiquitous. Topics at the
current frontier include the measurement of heavy element abundances in giant
planets, detection of carbon-based molecules, measurement of atmospheric
temperature profiles, definition of heat circulation efficiencies for tidally
locked planets, and the push to detect and characterize the atmospheres of
super-Earths. Future observatories for this quest include the James Webb Space

  Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics","some few misprints have been corrected",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper using the Clifford bundle formalism we show how starting from
the photon concept and its relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) we
immediately get (with a simple hypothesis concerning the form of the photon

$\boldsymbol{F}$ which is a plane wave solution (PWS) of ME. Moreover, we show
how introducing a potential $1$-form $\boldsymbol{A}$ such that
$\boldsymbol{F}=d\boldsymbol{A}$ we can see how a duality rotation changed in a
\ spatial rotation transformation besides showing how $\mathrm{i}=\sqrt{-1}$
enters Maxwell theory thus permitting the writing of a representative of ME as
Schr\""{o}dinger like equation which plays a key role in answering one of the
main questions addressed in this paper, namely: is there any sense in talking
about photon trajectories in de Broglie-Bohm like theories? To this end we
investigate first the nature of the energy-momentum \emph{extensor} field of
the Maxwell field $\mathbf{T}(n)$ in some special situations showing that for
some of those cases $\mathbf{T}_{0}=\mathbf{T}(\boldsymbol{\gamma}_{0})$ even
cannot describe the flow of energy. A proposed solution is offered. We also
prove that there exists a pulse reshaping phenomenon even in vacuum. Finally we
discuss the Schr\""{o}dinger equation for a photon that follows from quantum
field theory and investigate solutions that some authors think imply in photon
localization. We discuss if such an idea is meaningful. Moreover, we show that
for such solutions it is possible (once we accept that photon wave functions
are extended in the space and also in the time domains) to derive a generalized
HJE containing a quantum potential and which may lead to non lightlike photon
trajectories in free space. We briefly discuss our findings in relation to a
recent experiment.

laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of small galaxies in
exquisite detail. The Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) is an
NOAO community DECam survey of the Clouds mapping 480 square degrees
(distributed over ~2400 square degrees at ~20% filling factor) to ~24th mag in
ugriz with the goal of identifying broadly distributed, low surface brightness
stellar populations associated with the stellar halos and tidal debris of the
Clouds. SMASH will also derive spatially-resolved star formation histories
covering all ages out to large radii from the MCs that will further complement
our understanding of their formation. Here, we present a summary of the survey,
its data reduction, and a description of the first public Data Release (DR1).
The SMASH DECam data have been reduced with a combination of the NOAO Community
Pipeline, PHOTRED, an automated PSF photometry pipeline based mainly on the
DAOPHOT suite, and custom calibration software. The attained astrometric
precision is ~15 mas and the accuracy is ~2 mas with respect to the Gaia DR1
astrometric reference frame. The photometric precision is ~0.5-0.7% in griz and
~1% in u with a calibration accuracy of ~1.3% in all bands. The median 5 sigma
point source depths in ugriz bands are 23.9, 24.8, 24.5, 24.2, 23.5 mag. The
SMASH data already have been used to discover the Hydra II Milky Way satellite,
the SMASH 1 old globular cluster likely associated with the LMC, and very
extended stellar populations around the LMC out to R~18.4 kpc. SMASH DR1
contains measurements of ~100 million objects distributed in 61 fields. A
prototype version of the NOAO Data Lab provides data access, including a data
discovery tool, SMASH database access, an image cutout service, and a Jupyter
notebook server with example notebooks for exploratory analysis.

time and energy efficiency of distributed memory graph computations. It affects
memory locality, inter-task load balance, communication time, and overall
memory utilization. Graph layout could refer to partitioning or replication of
vertex and edge arrays, selective replication of data structures that hold
meta-data, and reordering vertex and edge identifiers. In this work, we present
DGL, a fast, parallel, and memory-efficient distributed graph layout strategy
that is specifically designed for small-world networks (low-diameter graphs
with skewed vertex degree distributions). Label propagation-based partitioning
and a scalable BFS-based ordering are the main steps in the layout strategy. We
show that the DGL layout can significantly improve end-to-end performance of
five challenging graph analytics workloads: PageRank, a parallel subgraph
enumeration program, tuned implementations of breadth-first search and
single-source shortest paths, and RDF3X-MPI, a distributed SPARQL query
processing engine. Using these benchmarks, we additionally offer a
comprehensive analysis on how graph layout affects the performance of graph
analytics with variable computation and communication characteristics.

based in part on the theory of Calkin (1963). It is shown how the polarization
vector ${\bf P}$ in Calkin's approach, naturally arises from the Lagrange
multiplier constraint equation for Faraday's equation for the magnetic
induction ${\bf B}$, or alternatively from the magnetic vector potential form
of Faraday's equation. Gauss's equation, (divergence of ${\bf B}$ is zero), is
incorporated in the variational principle by means of a Lagrange multiplier
constraint. Noether's theorem, coupled with the gauge symmetries is used to
derive the conservation laws for (a)\ magnetic helicity (b)\ cross helicity,
(c) fluid helicity for non-magnetized fluids, and (d) a class of conservation
laws associated with curl and divergence equations, which applies to Faraday's
equation and Gauss's equation. The magnetic helicity conservation law is due to
a gauge symmetry in MHD and not due to a fluid relabelling symmetry. The
analysis is carried out for the general case of a non-barotropic gas, in which
the gas pressure and internal energy density depend on both the entropy $S$ and
the gas density $\rho$. The cross helicity and fluid helicity conservation laws
in the non-barotropic case, are nonlocal conservation laws, that reduce to
local conservation laws for the case of a barotropic gas. The connections
between gauge symmetries, Clebsch potentials and Casimirs are developed. It is
shown that the gauge symmetry functionals in the work of Henyey (1982) satisfy
the Casimir determining equations.

show that bet-hedging can also be effective against demographic fluctuations

constant environment. A species can maximize its overall abundance in the long
term by diversifying into coexisting subpopulations of both ""fast-growing"" and

models of birth-death processes to incorporate dispersal, during which new
populations are founded, and can further incorporate variations of local

development in multicellular organisms, groups of living cells must often move
collectively. While considerable study has probed the biophysical mechanisms of
how eukaryotic cells generate forces during migration, little such study has
been devoted to bacteria, in particular with regard to the question of how
bacteria generate and coordinate forces during collective motion. This question
is addressed here for the first time using traction force microscopy. We study
two distinct motility mechanisms of Myxococcus xanthus, namely twitching and
gliding. For twitching, powered by type-IV pilus retraction, we find that
individual cells exert local traction in small hotspots with forces on the
order of 50 pN. Twitching of bacterial groups also produces traction hotspots,
however with amplified forces around 100 pN. Although twitching groups migrate
slowly as a whole, traction fluctuates rapidly on timescales <1.5 min. Gliding,
the second motility mechanism, is driven by lateral transport of substrate
adhesions. When cells are isolated, gliding produces low average traction on
the order of 1 Pa. However, traction is amplified in groups by a factor of ~5.
Since advancing protrusions of gliding cells push on average in the direction
of motion, we infer a long-range compressive load sharing among sub-leading
cells. Together, these results show that the forces generated during twitching
and gliding have complementary characters and both forces are collectively
amplified in groups.

orbital evolution of massive black holes (MBHs) in the aftermath of galactic
mergers and an important channel for formation of gravitationally bound MBH
binaries. We use 2D radiative hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the
efficiency of dynamical friction in the presence of radiative feedback from an
MBH moving through a uniform density gas. We find that ionizing radiation that
emerges from the innermost parts of the MBH's accretion flow strongly affects
the dynamical friction wake and renders dynamical friction inefficient for a
range of physical scenarios. MBHs in this regime tend to experience positive
net acceleration, meaning that they speed up, contrary to the expectations for
gaseous dynamical friction in absence of radiative feedback. The magnitude of
this acceleration is however negligibly small and should not significantly
alter the velocity of MBHs over relevant physical timescales. Our results
suggest that suppression of dynamical friction is more severe at the lower mass
end of the MBH spectrum which, compounded with inefficiency of the gas drag for
lower mass objects in general, implies that $< 10^7$ solar mass MBHs have fewer
means to reach the centers of merged galaxies. These findings provide
formulation for a sub-resolution model of dynamical friction in presence of MBH
radiative feedback that can be easily implemented in large scale simulations.

  As opposed to the extensive literature on facility location which considers
the multiplicative error, we focus on minimizing the worst-case additive error.
Minimizing the additive error incentivizes mechanisms to adapt to the size of
the instance. I.e., mechanisms can sacrifice little efficiency in small
instances (location profiles in which all agents are relatively close to one
another), in order to gain more [absolute] efficiency in large instances. We
argue that this measure is better suited for many manifestations of the

linear sampling method or the factorization method, from the numerical point of

Hagedorn-like instability takes place in the N=2 -> 0 models (for small enough

the untwisted moduli is studied at the quantum level by taking into account
both untwisted and twisted contributions to the 1-loop effective potential. The
latter depends on the specific branch of the gauge theory along which the

marginal deformations in the pure Coulomb phase, and in some mixed

reactions with $^{6}$Li and $^{7}$Li projectiles. Previous theoretical analyses
have shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup
leaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small
fraction of the total $\alpha$ inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing
toward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms.
  Purpose: We aim to provide a systematic study of the $\alpha$ inclusive cross
sections observed in nuclear reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. In
addition to estimating the total $\alpha$ singles cross sections, it is our
goal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these $\alpha$ particles
and compare with experimental data, when available.
  Method: We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive
breakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized
coupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For
the NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura,
Austern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C32, 432 (1982)], within the DWBA
approximation.
  Results: Overall, the sum of the computed EBU and NEB cross sections is found
to reproduce very well the measured singles cross sections. In all cases
analyzed, we find that the inclusive breakup cross section is largely dominated
by the NEB component.
  Conclusions: The presented method provides a global and systematic
description of inclusive breakup reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. It
provides also a natural explanation of the previously observed underestimation
of the measured $\alpha$ yields by CDCC calculations. The method used here can
be extended to other weakly-bound projectiles, including halo nuclei.

pulses - picosecond and below - of bright X- to gamma-rays. These nominally
narrow spectral bandwidth electromagnetic radiation pulses are efficiently
produced in the interaction between intense, well-focused electron and laser
beams. The spectral characteristics of such sources are affected by many
experimental parameters, such as the bandwidth of the laser, and the angles of
both the electrons and laser photons at collision. The laser field amplitude
induces harmonic generation and importantly, for the present work, nonlinear
red shifting, both of which dilute the spectral brightness of the radiation. As
the applications enabled by this source often depend sensitively on its
spectra, it is critical to resolve the details of the wavelength and angular
distribution obtained from ICS collisions. With this motivation, we present
here an experimental study that greatly improves on previous spectral
measurement methods based on X-ray K-edge filters, by implementing a
multi-layer bent-crystal X-ray spectrometer. In tandem with a collimating slit,
this method reveals a projection of the double-differential angular-wavelength
spectrum of the ICS radiation in a single shot. The measurements enabled by
this diagnostic illustrate the combined off-axis and nonlinear-field-induced
red shifting in the ICS emission process. They reveal in detail the strength of
the normalized laser vector potential, and provide a non-destructive measure of
the temporal and spatial electron-laser beam overlap.

model is built from a set of $276$ numerical relativity (NR) simulations with
mass ratios $q \leq 2$, dimensionless spin magnitudes up to $0.8$, and the
restriction that the initial spin of the smaller black hole lies along the axis
of orbital angular momentum. It produces waveforms which begin $\sim 30$

which contain the effects of precession as well as all $\ell \in \{2, 3\}$

compare the model to NR waveforms \emph{not} used to build the model, and find
a better agreement within the parameter range of the model than other,
state-of-the-art precessing waveform models, with typical mismatches of
$10^{-3}$. We also construct a frequency domain surrogate model (called

the current estimates of the equation's solution generated by each of its
neighbors, and nothing more. Neighbor relationships are represented by a
time-dependent directed graph $N(t)$ whose vertices correspond to agents and
whose arcs characterize neighbor relationships. Sufficient conditions on $N(t)$
were derived under which the algorithm can cause all agents' estimates to
converge exponentially fast to the same solution to $Ax = b$. These conditions
were also shown to be necessary for exponential convergence, provided the data
about $[A \; b]$ available to the agents is ""non-redundant"". The aim of this

algorithm to solve a class of non-convex optimal control problems with certain

dynamics and non-convex state/control constraints. To tackle the challenge
posed by non-convexity, first we utilize exact penalty function to handle the
nonlinear dynamics. Then the proposed algorithm successively convexifies the
problem via a $ \textit{project-and-linearize} $ procedure. Thus a finite
dimensional convex programming subproblem is solved at each succession, which
can be done efficiently with fast Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers. Global
convergence to a local optimum is demonstrated with certain convexity
assumptions, which are satisfied in a broad range of optimal control problems.
The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for solving trajectory planning
problems with collision avoidance constraints. Through numerical simulations,
we demonstrate that the algorithm converges reliably after only a few
successions. Thus with powerful IPM based custom solvers, the algorithm can be
implemented onboard for real-time autonomous control applications.

Recently, some
deep-learning-based tracking algorithms have been achieving record-breaking
performances. However, due to the high complexity of deep learning, most deep
trackers suffer from low tracking speed, and thus are impractical in many
real-world applications. Some new deep trackers with smaller network structure
achieve high efficiency while at the cost of significant decrease on precision.
In this paper, we propose to transfer the feature for image classification to
the visual tracking domain via convolutional channel reductions. The channel
reduction could be simply viewed as an additional convolutional layer with the
specific task. It not only extracts useful information for object tracking but
also significantly increases the tracking speed. To better accommodate the
useful feature of the target in different scales, the adaptation filters are
designed with different sizes. The yielded visual tracker is real-time and also
illustrates the state-of-the-art accuracies in the experiment involving two
well-adopted benchmarks with more than 100 test videos.

category $\mathcal V$. We set up the basic theory, and prove a classification
result in terms of braided oplax monoidal functors to the Drinfeld center of
some monoidal category $\mathcal T$.
  Even the basic theory is interesting; it shares many characteristics with the
theory of monoidal categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category, but
lacks some features. Of particular note, there is no cartesian product of
braided-enriched categories, and the natural transformations do not form a
2-category, but rather satisfy a braided interchange relation.
  Strikingly, our classification is slightly more general than what one might
have anticipated in terms of strong monoidal functors $\mathcal V \to
Z(\mathcal T)$. We would like to understand this further; in a future paper we
show that the functor is strong if and only if the enriched category is
`complete' in a certain sense. Nevertheless it remains to understand what
non-complete enriched categories may look like.
  One should think of our construction as a generalization of
de-equivariantization, which takes a strong monoidal functor $\mathsf{Rep}(G)
\to Z(\mathcal T)$ for some finite group $G$ and a monoidal category $\mathcal
T$, and produces a new monoidal category $\mathcal T // G$. In our setting,
given any braided oplax monoidal functor $\mathcal V \to Z(\mathcal T)$, for
any braided $\mathcal V$, we produce $\mathcal T // \mathcal V$: this is not
usually an `honest' monoidal category, but is instead $\mathcal V$-enriched. If
$\mathcal V$ has a braided lax monoidal functor to $\mathsf{Vec}$, we can use
this to reduce the enrichment to $\mathsf{Vec}$, and this recovers
de-equivariantization as a special case.

identify all of the communities to which each node affiliates. Instead of
taking this approach, we introduce versatility, $V$, as a novel metric of nodal
affiliation: $V \sim 0$ means that a node is consistently assigned to a
specific community; $V \gg 0$ means it is inconsistently assigned to different
communities. Versatility works in conjunction with existing community detection
algorithms, and it satisfies many theoretically desirable properties in
idealised networks designed to maximise ambiguity of modular decomposition. The
local minima of global mean versatility identified the resolution parameters of
a hierarchical community detection algorithm that least ambiguously decomposed
the community structure of a social (karate club) network and the mouse brain
connectome. Our results suggest that nodal versatility is useful in quantifying
the inherent ambiguity of modular decomposition.

cycles to duplicate themselves accurately and to control their cell sizes.
Growth of Escherichia coli, in particular, follows a relation known as
Schaechter 's growth law. This law says that the average cell volume scales
exponentially with growth rate, with a scaling exponent equal to the time from
initiation of a round of DNA replication to the cell division at which the
corresponding sister chromosomes segregate. Here, we sought to test the
robustness of the growth law to systematic perturbations in cell dimensions
achieved by varying the expression levels of mreB and ftsZ. We found that
decreasing the mreB level resulted in increased cell width, with little change
in cell length, whereas decreasing the ftsZ level resulted in increased cell
length. Furthermore, the time from replication termination to cell division
increased with the perturbed dimension in both cases. Moreover, the growth law
remained valid over a range of growth conditions and dimension perturbations.
The growth law can be quantitatively interpreted as a consequence of a tight
coupling of cell division to replication initiation. Thus, its robustness to
perturbations in cell dimensions strongly supports models in which the timing
of replication initiation governs that of cell division, and cell volume is the
key phenomenological variable governing the timing of replication initiation.
These conclusions are discussed in the context of our recently proposed
adder-per-origin model, in which cells add a constant volume per origin between
initiations and divide a constant time after initiation.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.CY cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to mine a user's visiting history
and find her/his potentially preferred places. Although location recommendation
methods have been studied and improved pervasively, the challenges w.r.t
employing various influences including temporal aspect still remain. Inspired
by the fact that time includes numerous granular slots (e.g. minute, hour, day,
week and etc.), in this paper, we define a new problem to perform
recommendation through exploiting all diversified temporal factors. In
particular, we argue that most existing methods only focus on a limited number
of time-related features and neglect others. Furthermore, considering a
specific granularity (e.g. time of a day) in recommendation cannot always apply
to each user or each dataset. To address the challenges, we propose a
probabilistic generative model, named after Multi-aspect Time-related Influence
(MATI) to promote POI recommendation. We also develop a novel optimization
algorithm based on Expectation Maximization (EM). Our MATI model firstly
detects a user's temporal multivariate orientation using her check-in log in
Location-based Social Networks(LBSNs). It then performs recommendation using
temporal correlations between the user and proposed locations. Our method is
adaptable to various types of recommendation systems and can work efficiently
in multiple time-scales. Extensive experimental results on two large-scale LBSN
datasets verify the effectiveness of our method over other competitors.

Here, we examine several common materials and illustrate various problems and

qualitative insight from density functional theory, we show that the
superconducting and low-energy thermodynamic properties of the FeSCs can be
described semi-quantitively within multiband Eliashberg theory. We account for
an important high-energy mass renormalization phenomenologically,and in
agreement with constraints provided by thermodynamic, optical, and
angle-resolved photoemission data. When seen in this way, all FeSCs with
$T_\mathrm{c} <$ 40~K studied so far are found to belong to an {\it
intermediate} coupling regime. This finding is in contrast to the strong
coupling scenarios proposed in the early period of the FeSC history.We also
discuss several related issues, including the role of band shifts as measured
by the positions of van Hove singularities, and the nature of a recently
suggested quantum critical point in the strongly hole-doped systems
AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). Using high-precision full relativistic GGA-band

Fermi surface sheets, only the $\varepsilon$-pocket near the corner of the BZ
is compatible with the experimentally observed anisotropy of the upper critical
field. pointing to its dominant role in the superconductivity of these three

charged under the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetry, in conjunction with newly
introduced three right-handed Majorana neutrinos and the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$
Higgs. The model is built on the classical scale invariance, that is
dynamically broken by a new strongly coupled sector, what is called the

show that our model learnt generic audio features, similar to the way CNNs

effect: (i) gravitational waves propagating in such a neutrino background
exhibit birefringent behaviour leading to an enhancement/suppression of the
gravitational wave amplitudes depending on the polarisation, where the

elegantly analyzed with the logic programming language Prolog. Moreover, Prolog
offers further advantages for a thorough analysis: On the one hand, it natively
provides versatile options to efficiently process tree or graph data
structures. On the other hand, Prolog's non-determinism and backtracking eases
tests of different variations of the program flow without big effort. A
rule-based approach with Prolog allows to characterize the verification goals

given abstract syntax tree of C++ source code into Prolog facts and derive the
call graph and the execution sequence (tree), which then are further tested
against verification goals. The different program flow branching due to control
structures is derived by backtracking as subtrees of the full execution
sequence. Finally, these subtrees are verified in Prolog.
  We illustrate our approach with a case study, where we search for incorrect

Our extension respects the type system of Curry so that run-time errors due to
ill-typed data are avoided. This is obtained by preprocessing SQL statements at
compile time and translating them into type-safe database access operations. As
a consequence, the type checker of the Curry system can spot type errors in SQL
statements at compile time. To generate appropriately typed access operations,
the preprocessor uses an entity-relationship (ER) model describing the
structure of the relational data. In addition to standard SQL, SQL statements
embedded in Curry can include program expressions and also relationships
specified in the ER model. The latter feature is useful to avoid the
error-prone use of foreign keys. As a result, our SQL integration supports a
high-level and type-safe access to databases in Curry programs.

networks. Agglomeration is a common technique when designing parallel
programmes to control the granularity of the computation thereby finding a
better fit between the algorithm and the machine on which the algorithm runs.
Usually this is done by grouping smaller tasks and computing them en bloc
within one parallel process. In the case of sorting networks this could be done
by computing bigger parts of the network with one process. The agglomeration
law in this paper pursues a different strategy: The input data is grouped and
the algorithm is generalized to work on the agglomerated input while the
original structure of the algorithm remains. This will result in a new access
opportunity to sorting networks well-suited for efficient parallelization on
modern multicore computers, computer networks or GPGPU programming.
Additionally this enables us to use sorting networks as (parallel or
distributed) merging stages for arbitrary sorting algorithms, thereby creating
new hybrid sorting algorithms with ease. The expressiveness of functional
programming languages helps us to apply this law to systematically constructed
sorting networks, leading to efficient and easily adaptable sorting algorithms.
An application example is given, using the Eden programming language to show
the effectiveness of the law. The implementation is compared with different
parallel sorting algorithms by runtime behaviour.

  Recent results provide confluence criteria for conditional term rewrite

is a problem to decide whether a given element is in the defined set or not,
which corresponds to an execution of the program. This paper introduces reduced
proof graphs, and studies a technique to solve the membership problem of PBESs,
which is undecidable in general, by transforming it into a reduced proof graph.
  A vertex X(v) in a proof graph represents that the data v is in the set X, if
the graph satisfies conditions induced from a given PBES. Proof graphs are,
however, infinite in general. Thus we introduce vertices each of which stands
for a set of vertices of the original ones, which possibly results in a finite

reduced proof graphs should satisfy. We also show some examples having no
finite proof graph except for reduced one. We further propose a reduced

simpler sub-theories, whose interaction is regulated in a limited number of
ways, which reveals a topological substrate when pictured by string diagrams.
By exploring the double nature of computads as presentations of higher
algebraic theories, and combinatorial descriptions of ""directed spaces"", we
develop a basic language of directed topology for the compositional study of
algebraic theories. We present constructions of computads, all with clear
analogues in standard topology, that capture in great generality such notions

that lead to the theory of Frobenius algebras and of bialgebras. After a number
of examples, we describe how a fragment of the ZX calculus can be reconstructed

computational applications. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to provide a
satisfactory method for introducing mixing in other compact closed categories
such as the category of sets and binary relations. We therefore lack a uniform
strategy for extending a category to model imprecise linguistic information.
  In this work we adopt a different approach. We analyze different forms of
ambiguous and incomplete information, both with and without quantitative
probabilistic data. Each scheme then corresponds to a suitable enrichment of
the category in which we model language. We view different monads as
encapsulating the informational behaviour of interest, by analogy with their
use in modelling side effects in computation. Previous results of Jacobs then
allow us to systematically construct suitable bases for enrichment.
  We show that we can freely enrich arbitrary dagger compact closed categories
in order to capture all the phenomena of interest, whilst retaining the
important dagger compact closed structure. This allows us to construct a model
with real convex combination of binary relations that makes non-trivial use of
the scalars. Finally we relate our various different enrichments, showing that
finite subconvex algebra enrichment covers all the effects under consideration.

conditional follows from an analysis of operational concepts in quantum theory.
Here, we attempt such an analysis through quantum set theory (QST). In this
paper, we develop quantum set theory based on quantum logics with those three
conditionals, each of which defines different quantum logical truth value
assignment. We show that those three models satisfy the transfer principle of
the same form to determine the quantum logical truth values of theorems of the
ZFC set theory. We also show that the reals in the model and the truth values
of their equality are the same for those models. Interestingly, however, the
order relation between quantum reals significantly depends on the underlying
conditionals. We characterize the operational meanings of those order relations
in terms of joint probability obtained by the successive projective
measurements of arbitrary two observables. Those characterizations clearly show
their individual features and will play a fundamental role in future

numerical simulation of countless physical phenomena or processes in applied
sciences. One of the reasons for this undeniable success is the great
versatility of the finite-element approach to deal with different types of
geometries. This is particularly true of problems posed in curved domains of
arbitrary shape. In the case of function-value Dirichlet conditions prescribed
on curvilinear boundaries method's isoparametric version for meshes consisting
of curved triangles or tetrahedra has been mostly employed to recover the
optimal approximation properties known to hold for standard straight-edged
elements in the case of polygonal or polyhedral domains. However, besides
obvious algebraic and geometric inconveniences, the isoparametric technique is
helplessly limited in scope and simplicity, since its extension to degrees of
freedom other than function values is not straightforward if not unknown. The
purpose of this paper is to propose, study and test a simple alternative that
bypasses all the above drawbacks, without eroding qualitative approximation
properties. More specifically this technique can do without curved elements and
is based only on polynomial algebra. REMARKS : First submission (dated Jan. 3,

trajectories crossing these points. Such points are of different types. Some of
them can be easily ruled out by considering another non singular flat output,
defined on an open set intersecting the domain of the former one and well
defined at the point in question. However, it might happen that no well-defined
flat outputs exist at all at some points. We call these points \emph{intrinsic}
singularities and the other ones \emph{apparent}. A rigorous defintion of these
points is introduced in terms of atlas and charts in the framework of the
differential geometry of jets of infinite order and Lie-B\""acklund isomorphisms

division. As the number of cells increases exponentially in time, the
microscopic model is challenging in terms of computational time. To overcome
this problem, we aim at deriving the associated macroscopic dynamics leading
here to a porous media type equation. As we are interested in the long time
behavior of the dynamics, the macroscopic equation obtained through usual
derivation method fails at providing the correct qualitative behavior (e.g.
stationary states differ from the microscopic dynamics). We propose a modified
version of the macroscopic equation introducing a density threshold for the
repulsion. We numerically validate the new formulation by comparing the
solutions of the micro- and macro- dynamics. Moreover, we study the asymptotic
behavior of the dynamics as the repulsion between cells becomes singular
(leading to non-overlapping constraints in the microscopic model). We manage to
show formally that such an asymptotic limit leads to a Hele-Shaw type problem
for the macroscopic dynamics.
  The macroscopic model derived in this paper therefore enables to overcome the
problem of large computational time raised by the microscopic model and stays
closely linked to the microscopic dynamics.

follow-up paper Aronov, Miller and Sharir (SODA 2017) proved an
$O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ bound for triangles, but their method results in
pieces with curved boundaries. Moreover, their method uses polynomial
partitions, for which currently no algorithm is known. Thus the most natural
version of the problem is still wide open: Can we cut any collection of $n$
disjoint triangles in ${\Bbb R}^3$ into a subquadratic number of triangular
fragments that admit a depth order? And if so, can we compute the cuts
efficiently?
  We answer this question by presenting an algorithm that cuts any set of $n$
disjoint triangles in ${\Bbb R}^3$ into $O(n^{7/4}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$
triangular fragments that admit a depth order. The running time of our
algorithm is $O(n^{3.69})$. We also prove a refined bound that depends on the
number, $K$, of intersections between the projections of the triangle edges
onto the $xy$-plane: we show that $O(n^{1+\varepsilon} + n^{1/4}
K^{3/4}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$ fragments suffice to obtain a depth order. This
result extends to $xy$-monotone surface patches bounded by a constant number of
bounded-degree algebraic arcs, constituting the first subquadratic bound for
surface patches. As a byproduct of our approach we obtain a faster algorithm to
cut a set of lines into $O(n^{3/2}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$ fragments that admit a
depth order.

dissipation scale depends on the energy cascade rate, i.e., the larger the
energy input rate per unit mass, the more the turbulent fluctuations need to be
driven to increasingly smaller scales to dissipate the larger energy flux.
Observations of magnetic spectral energy densities indicate that this intuitive
picture is not valid in solar wind turbulence. Dissipation seems to set in at
the same length scale for different solar wind conditions independently of the
energy flux. To investigate this difference in more detail, we present an
analytic dissipation model for solar wind turbulence at electron scales, which
we compare with observed spectral densities. Our model combines the energy
transport from large to small scales and collisionless damping, which removes
energy from the magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic regime. We assume
wave-particle interactions of kinetic Alfv\'{e}n waves (KAW) to be the main
damping process. Wave frequencies and damping rates of KAW are obtained from
the hot plasma dispersion relation. Our model assumes a critically balanced
turbulence, where larger energy cascade rates excite larger parallel
wavenumbers for a certain perpendicular wavenumber. If the dissipation is
additionally wave driven such that the dissipation rate is proportional to the
parallel wavenumber - as with KAW - then an increase of the energy cascade rate
is counter-balanced by an increased dissipation rate for the same perpendicular
wavenumber leading to a dissipation length independent of the energy cascade
rate.

this small transverse momentum scale allows nonperturbative transverse momentum
dependent effects to be probed in high $p_T$ dihadron and direct photon-hadron

component from a near-side $\pi^0$ or direct photon, is sensitive to
initial-state $k_T$ and final-state fragmentation transverse momentum $j_T$ and
thus can probe nonperturbative transverse-momentum-dependent effects. In the
transverse-momentum-dependent framework, nearly back-to-back particle
production in $p$+$p$ collisions with a measured final-state hadron has been
predicted to break factorization due to the possibility of gluon exchanges with
colored remnants in the initial and final states. For this reason, the
interacting partons are predicted to be correlated; however, there is so far no
quantitative prediction for the magnitude of such effects. In this talk, recent
measurements of dihadron and direct-photon hadron correlations in $p$+$p$

of different colors. The images confirm that Philae was perched on a sloped
surface. A local horizon is visible in one corner of the image, beyond which we
can see the coma. Having spent a full day on the surface Philae was commanded
to lift and rotate, after which a final, sixth, LED image was acquired. The
change in perspective allowed us to construct a shape model of the surface. The
distance to the foreground was about 80 cm, much larger than the nominal 30 cm.
This caused stray light, rather than directly reflected LED light, to dominate
the image signal, complicating the analysis. The images show a lumpy surface
with a roughness of apparently fractal nature. Its appearance is completely
different from that of the first landing site, which was characterized by
centimeter to meter-sized debris (Mottola et al., 2015). We recognize neither
particles nor pores at the image resolution of 0.8 mm per pixel and large color
variations are absent. The surface has a bi-modal brightness distribution that

becomes saturated and cannot be used in classical reconstruction methods. For
example, in C-arm angiography systems, which provide projection radiography,
fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and are widely used for medical
diagnoses and interventions, the limited dynamic range of C-arm flat detectors
leads to overexposure in some projections during an acquisition, such as
imaging relatively thin body parts (e.g., the knee). Aiming at overexposure
correction for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, we in this paper
propose a mixed one-bit compressive sensing (M1bit-CS) to acquire information
from both regular and saturated measurements. This method is inspired by the
recent progress on one-bit compressive sensing, which deals with only sign
observations. Its successful applications imply that information carried by
saturated measurements is useful to improve recovery quality. For the proposed
M1bit-CS model, alternating direction methods of multipliers is developed and
an iterative saturation detection scheme is established. Then we evaluate
M1bit-CS on one-dimensional signal recovery tasks. In some experiments, the
performance of the proposed algorithms on mixed measurements is almost the same
as recovery on unsaturated ones with the same amount of measurements. Finally,
we apply the proposed method to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction
on a phantom and a simulated clinical image. The results are promising, as the
typical streaking artifacts and capping artifacts introduced by saturated
projection data are effectively reduced, yielding significant error reduction
compared with existing algorithms based on extrapolation.

soon larger than clusters born from lower $\Sigma_{\rm cloud}$ conditions. To
form a young cluster of a given age, stellar mass and mass surface density,
these models need to assume a parent molecular clump that is many times denser,

which gather several hundred participants, are rotating between different
regions. The March 2017 one will be held in Barcelona and the September 2017
one in Montreal, after Tokyo and Denver in 2016. The RDA work is organized
bottom-up, with Working Groups which have 18 months to produce implementable
deliverables and Interest Groups which serve as platforms of communication and
discussion and also produce important outputs such as surveys and
recommendations. There are currently 27 Working Groups and 45 Interest Groups,
tackling a wide diversity of subjects, including community needs, reference for
sharing, data stewardship and services, and topics related to the base
infrastructure of data sharing. Some scientific communities use the RDA as a
neutral forum to define their own disciplinary data sharing framework, with
major successes such as the Wheat Data Interoperability Working Group which
worked in coordination with the International Wheat Initiative. Astronomy has
the IVOA to define its interoperability standards, and so we do not need to
create a Group for that purpose in the RDA. But many topics discussed in the
RDA have a strong interest for us, for instance on data citation or
certification of data repositories. We have a lot to share from what we have
learnt in building our disciplinary global data infrastructure; we also have a
lot to learn from others. The paper discusses RDA current themes or results of
interest for astronomy data providers, and current liaisons with astronomy.

current blockades as DNA translocates into or out of the geometric confinement
of such conically shaped pores. We studied how the geometry of a nanopore
affects the detected ionic current signal of a translocating DNA molecule over
a wide range of salt concentration. The blockade level in the ionic current
depends on the translocation direction at a high salt concentration, and at
lower salt concentrations we find a non-intuitive ionic current decrease and
increase within each single event for the DNA translocations exiting from
confinement. We use recently developed DNA rulers with markers and finite
element calculations to explain our observations. Our calculations explain the
shapes of the signals observed at all salt concentrations and show that the
unexpected current decrease and increase are due to the competing effects of
ion concentration polarization and geometric exclusion of ions. Our analysis
shows that over a wide range of geometry, voltage and salt concentrations we
are able to understand the ionic current signals of DNA in asymmetric nanopores

image-related inverse problems including denoising, deblurring and deblocking.
However, a majority of reconstruction methods only exploit the nonlocal
self-similarity (NSS) prior of the degraded observation image, it is very
challenging to reconstruct the latent clean image. In this paper we propose a
novel model for image denoising via group sparsity residual and external NSS
prior. To boost the performance of image denoising, the concept of group
sparsity residual is proposed, and thus the problem of image denoising is
transformed into one that reduces the group sparsity residual. Due to the fact
that the groups contain a large amount of NSS information of natural images, we
obtain a good estimation of the group sparse coefficients of the original image
by the external NSS prior based on Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) learning and
the group sparse coefficients of noisy image is used to approximate the
estimation. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method not
only outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, but also delivers the best
qualitative denoising results with finer details and less ringing artifacts.

in young solar analogs by performing the first homogeneous and unbiased study

1.4mm of glycolaldehyde emission lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure (PdB)
interferometer in the framework of the CALYPSO IRAM large program. Results:
Glycolaldehyde has been detected towards 3 Class 0 and 1 Class I protostars out
of the 13 continuum sources targeted in Perseus: NGC1333-IRAS2A1,
NGC1333-IRAS4A2, NGC1333-IRAS4B1, and SVS13-A. The NGC1333 star forming region
looks particularly glycolaldehyde rich, with a rate of occurrence up to 60%.
The glycolaldehyde spatial distribution overlaps with the continuum one,
tracing the inner 100 au around the protostar. A large number of lines (up to
18), with upper-level energies Eu from 37 K up to 375 K has been detected. We
derived column densities > 10^15 cm^-2 and rotational temperatures Trot between
115 K and 236 K, imaging for the first time hot-corinos around NGC1333-IRAS4B1
and SVS13-A. Conclusions: In multiple systems glycolaldehyde emission is
detected only in one component. The case of the SVS13-A+B and IRAS4-A1+A2
systems support that the detection of glycolaldehyde (at least in the present
Perseus sample) indicates older protostars (i.e. SVS13-A and IRAS4-A2), evolved
enough to develop the hot-corino region (i.e. 100 K in the inner 100 au).
However, only two systems do not allow us to firmly conclude whether the
primary factor leading to the detection of glycolaldehyde emission is the
environments hosting the protostars, evolution (e.g. low value of Lsubmm/Lint),
or accretion luminosity (high Lint).

description of the evolution of cosmic structure furnished by the Szekeres dust
models (a non-spherical exact solution of Einstein's equations) and the
dynamics of Cosmological Perturbation Theory (CPT) for dust sources in a
$\Lambda$CDM background. We show how the dynamics of Szekeres models can be
described by evolution equations given in terms of ""exact fluctuations"" that
identically reduce (at all orders) to evolution equations of CPT in the
comoving isochronous gauge. We explicitly show how Szekeres linearised exact
fluctuations are specific (deterministic) realisations of standard linear
perturbations of CPT given as random fields but, as opposed to the latter
perturbations, they can be evolved exactly into the full non-linear regime. We
prove two important results: (i) the conservation of the curvature perturbation
(at all scales) also holds for the appropriate approximation of the exact
Szekeres fluctuations in a $\Lambda$CDM background, and (ii) the different
collapse morphologies of Szekeres models yields, at nonlinear order, different
functional forms for the growth factor that follows from the study of redshift
space distortions. The metric based potentials used in linear CPT are computed
in terms of the parameters of the linearised Szekeres models, thus allowing us
to relate our results to linear CPT results in other gauges. We believe that
these results provide a solid starting stage to examine the role of

short-reach communication links within high-performance electronic systems.
Multimode polymer waveguides in particular are strong candidates for use in
passive optical backplanes as they can be cost-effectively integrated onto
standard PCBs. Various optical backplanes using this technology and featuring a
large number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently
demonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex
waveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>=25 Gb/s)
due to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch
conditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the
highly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore,
we present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode
waveguides and waveguide components (i.e. bends and crossings) that enable the
implementation of passive optical backplanes. The performance of these
components is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for
different waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication.
Useful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for
each waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters
depends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and
desired link bandwidth. As an application of these studies, the obtained
results are employed to optimise the loss performance of a 10-card shuffle
router and enable >=40 Gb/s data transmission.

nuclear reaction $^{23}$Mg $(p, \gamma)$ $^{24}$Al by three models of Lai (LD),
Fushiki et al. (FGP), and Liu et al. (LJ) on the surface of magnetars. Our
results show that the rates can be greatly enhanced by three orders of
magnitude due to the influence of SES. The rates in our model are in good
agreement with those of LD and FGP at relatively low density environment (e.g.
$\rho_7<0.01$) for $1<B_{12}<10^2$. On the other hand, in relatively high
magnetic fields (e.g. $B_{12}>10^2$), the rates of our model can be 1.58 times
and around three orders of magnitude larger than those of FGP and LD,
respectively. The significant increase of the rates of our model for $^{23}$Mg
$(p, \gamma)$ $^{24}$Al implies that more $^{23}$Mg will escape from the Ne-Na
cycle due to SES in SMFs. As a consequence, the next reaction $^{24}$Al
$(\beta^+, \nu)$ $^{24}$Mg will produce more $^{24}$Mg to participate in the
Mg-Al cycle. Thus, it may lead to synthesize a large amount of production of
$A\geq 20$ nuclides (e.g. $^{26}$Al) on the surface of magnetars. These heavy
elements (e.g. $^{26}$Al) may be thrown out due to the compact binary mergers
of double neutron star (NS-NS) or black hole and neutron star (BH and NS)
systems. Our results may help to understand why the $^{26}$Al is always
overabundance in the interstellar space. Our conclusion may be helpful to the
investigation of the nucleosynthesis of some heavy elements, the energy
generation rate, and the numerical calculations of magnetars evolution.

be similar to the detected FRB frequencies. These `coincidences' lend some
credence to the possibility that FRBs might be artificial in origin. Other
relevant quantities, such as the characteristic mass of the light sail, and the
angular velocity of the beam, are also derived. By using the FRB occurrence
rate, we infer upper bounds on the rate of FRBs from extragalactic

being predicted. The failure to predict recessions is a persistent theme in
economic forecasting. The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) provides
data on predictions made for the growth of total output, GDP, in the United
States for one, two, three and four quarters ahead since the end of the 1960s.
Over a three quarters ahead horizon, the mean prediction made for GDP growth
has never been negative over this period. The correlation between the mean SPF
three quarters ahead forecast and the data is very low, and over the most
recent 25 years is not significantly different from zero.
  Here, we show that the machine learning technique of random forests has the
potential to give early warning of recessions. We use a small set of
explanatory variables from financial markets which would have been available to
a forecaster at the time of making the forecast. We train the algorithm over
the 1970Q2-1990Q1 period, and make predictions one, three and six quarters
ahead. We then re-train over 1970Q2-1990Q2 and make a further set of
predictions, and so on. We did not attempt any optimisation of predictions,
using only the default input parameters to the algorithm we downloaded in the
package R.
  We compare the predictions made from 1990 to the present with the actual
data. One quarter ahead, the algorithm is not able to improve on the SPF
predictions. Three and six quarters ahead, the correlations between actual and
predicted are low, but they are very significantly different from zero.
Although the timing is slightly wrong, a serious downturn in the first half of
2009 could have been predicted six quarters ahead in late 2007. The algorithm
never predicts a recession when one did not occur.
  We obtain even stronger results with random forest machine learning
techniques in the case of the United Kingdom.

found that the nonreciprocity effect of the MO material does not only result in
a nonvanishing reflected shift at normal incidence, but also leads to a
slab-thickness-independent term which breaks the symmetry between the reflected
and transmitted shifts at oblique incidence. The asymptotic behaviors of the
normal-incidence reflected shift are obtained in the vicinity of two
characteristic frequencies corresponding to a minimum reflectivity and a total
reflection, respectively. Moreover, the coexistence of two types of
negative-reflected-shift (NRS) at oblique incidence is discussed. We show that
the reversal of the shifts from positive to negative values can be realized by
tuning the magnitude of applied magnetic field, the frequency of incident wave
and the slab thickness as well as the incident angle. In addition, we further
investigate two special cases for practical purposes: the reflected shift with
a total reflection and the transmitted shift with a total transmission.

this non-Markovian approach to Brownian motion, we find out anomalous diffusion
characterized by the mean square displacement of a free particle and a harmonic

challenge with established optical techniques due to the commonly required
labeling of the reactants or the enzyme itself. The labeling process is usually
non-trivial and the labels themselves might skew the physical properties of the

enzymatic interactions and the associated conformational changes on the single

near-field enhancement provided by plasmonic nanorods resonantly coupled to
whispering gallery modes in microcavities. Specifically, we employ two
different recognition schemes: one in which the kinetics of polymerase/DNA
interactions are probed in the vicinity of DNA-functionalized nanorods, and the
other in which these interactions are probed via the magnitude of
conformational changes in the polymerase molecules immobilized on nanorods. In
both approaches we find that low and high polymerase activities can be clearly
discerned via their characteristic signal amplitude and signal length
distributions. Furthermore, the thermodynamic study of the monitored
interactions suggests the occurrence of DNA polymerization. This work
constitutes a proof-of-concept study of enzymatic activities via plasmonically
