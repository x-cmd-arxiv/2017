predominantly the same genes, yet display a continuum of phenotypes. While it
is known how one genotype can generate such non-genetic diversity, it remains
unclear how different phenotypes contribute to the performance of biological
function at the population level. We developed a microfluidic device to
simultaneously measure the phenotype and chemotactic performance of tens of
thousands of individual, freely-swimming Escherichia coli as they climbed a
gradient of attractant. We discovered that spatial structure spontaneously
emerged from initially well-mixed wild type populations due to non-genetic
diversity. By manipulating the expression of key chemotaxis proteins, we
established a causal relationship between protein expression, non- genetic
diversity, and performance that was theoretically predicted. This approach
generated a complete phenotype-to-performance map, in which we found a
nonlinear regime. We used this map to demonstrate how changing the shape of a
phenotypic distribution can have as large of an effect on collective
performance as changing the mean phenotype, suggesting that selection could act
on both during the process of adaptation.

concentrate on spreading of a droplet within a recessed stadium-shaped pixel,
with applications to the manufacture of POLED displays, and find that the
sloping side wall of the pixel can either locally enhance or hinder spreading
depending on whether the topography gradient ahead of the contact line is
positive or negative. Locally enhanced spreading occurs via the formation of
thin pointed rivulets along the side walls of the pixel through a mechanism
similar to capillary rise in sharp corners. We demonstrate that a thin-film
model combined with an experimentally measured spreading law, which relates the
speed of the contact line to the contact angle, provides excellent predictions
of the evolving liquid morphologies. We also show that the spreading can be
adequately described by a Cox-Voinov law for the majority of the evolution. The
model does not include viscous effects and hence, the timescales for the
propagation of the thin pointed rivulets are not captured. Nonetheless, this
simple model can be used very effectively to predict the areas covered by the
liquid and may serve as a useful design tool for systems that require precise
control of liquid on substrates.

the early universe. We consider three different versions of the Van der Waals

that two of the models do not fit constraints from observation. A third model

brightness asymmetry detected in polarized reflected light recently challenged
our understanding of scattering by the dust particles in this system. Secondly,
the morphology of the ring strongly suggests the presence of planets, although
no planets have been detected to date. We obtained high-angular resolution
coronagraphic images of the circumstellar environment around HR4796A with
VLT/SPHERE during the commissioning of the instrument in May 2014 and during
guaranteed-time observations in February 2015. The observations reveal for the
first time the entire ring of dust, including the semi-minor axis that was
previously hidden either behind the coronagraphic spot or in the speckle noise.
We determine empirically the scattering phase function of the dust in the H
band from 13.6deg to 166.6deg. It shows a prominent peak of forward scattering,
never detected before, for scattering angles below 30deg. We analyse the
reflectance spectra of the disc from the 0.95 to 1.6 microns, confirming the
red colour of the dust, and derive detection limits on the presence of
planetary mass objects. We confirm which side of the disc is inclined towards
the Earth. The analysis of the phase function suggests that the dust population
is dominated by particles much larger than the observation wavelength, of about
20 microns. Compact Mie grains of this size are incompatible with the spectral
energy distribution of the disc, however the observed rise in scattering
efficiency beyond 50deg points towards aggregates which could reconcile both
observables. We do not detect companions orbiting the star but our
high-contrast observations provide the most stringent constraints yet on the
presence of planets responsible for the morphology of the dust.

periodicity. Periods of the dominant variability in the newly discovered group
are $0.28<P_{\rm D}<0.41$\,days. Period ratios $(0.68 - 0.72)$ are smaller than
the period ratios of the Galactic bulge RRd stars. The typical amplitude ratio
(of the additional to the dominant periodicity) is 20\,\% for the stars
identified as fundamental mode RR~Lyrae and 50\,\% for stars classified as the
first-overtone RR~Lyrae. Ten stars from our sample exhibit equidistant peaks in
the frequency spectrum, that suggest the Blazhko-type modulation of the main
pulsation frequency and/or the additional periodicity. The Fourier coefficients
$R_{\mathrm{21}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{31}}$ are one of the lowest among fundamental
mode RR Lyrae stars, but among the highest for the first-overtone pulsators.
For the phase Fourier coefficients $\varphi_{\mathrm{21}}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{31}}$, our stars lie in between RRab and RRc stars. Discussed
stars were compared with the radial, linear pulsation models. Their position in
the Petersen diagram cannot be reproduced assuming that two radial modes are
excited and their physical parameters are similar to that characteristic for
RR~Lyrae stars. The non-radial mode scenario also faces difficulties. We
conclude that the dominant variability is most likely due to pulsation in the
radial fundamental mode including stars classified as the first overtone mode
pulsators. At this point, we cannot explain the nature of the additional
periodicity. Even more, classification of the stars as RR~Lyrae should be
treated as tentative.

  Unfortunately, the problem extends even to the release of aggregate data
statistics. This counter-intuitive phenomenon has come to be known as the
Fundamental Law of Information Recovery. It says that overly accurate estimates
of too many statistics can completely destroy privacy. One may think of this as
death by a thousand cuts. Every statistic computed from a data set leaks a
small amount of information about each member of the data set - a tiny cut.
This is true even if the exact value of the statistic is distorted a bit in

harmless little cut in terms of privacy risk for any individual, the cumulative
effect can be to completely compromise the privacy of some individuals.

al and a corresponding linear complementarity problem (LCP). We show that the
CPL, like KKT conditions and other simply switched systems, cannot be open
without being injective. Hence some of the intriguing PL structure described by
Scholtes is lost in the transformation from OPL to CPL. To both problems one
may apply Newton variants with appropriate generalized Jacobians directly
computable from the abs-normal representation. Alternatively, the CPL can be
solved by Bokhoven's modulus method and related fixed point iterations. We
compile the properties of the various schemes and highlight the connection to
the properties of the Schur complement matrix, in particular its signed real
spectral radius as analyzed by Rump. Numerical experiments and suitable
combinations of the fixed point solvers and stabilized generalized Newton
variants remain to be realized.

well the relationship between the Ca II H-line emission and $B_{\rm LOS}$, and

oscillations, which can display substantial regularity even when the individual

coexists with regular oscillations at the global level is still unclear. Here
we show that a combination of stochastic recurrence-based initiation with
deterministic refractoriness in an excitable network can reconcile these two
features, leading to maximum collective coherence for an intermediate noise
level. We report this behavior in the slow oscillation regime exhibited by a
cerebral cortex network under dynamical conditions resembling slow-wave sleep
and anaesthesia. Computational analysis of a biologically realistic network
model reveals that an intermediate level of background noise leads to
quasi-regular dynamics. We verify this prediction experimentally in cortical
slices subject to varying amounts of extracellular potassium, which modulates
neuronal excitability and thus synaptic noise. The model also predicts that
this effectively regular state should exhibit noise-induced memory of the
spatial propagation profile of the collective oscillations, which is also
verified experimentally. Taken together, these results allow us to construe the
enhanced regularity observed experimentally in the brain as an instance of
collective stochastic coherence.

introduced by S. Ito and T. Sadahiro. We compares some aspects of the
$(-\beta)$-shift to the $\beta$-shift. When the expansion in base $ -\beta $ of
$ -\frac{\beta}{\beta+1} $ is periodic with odd period or when $ \beta $ is
strictly less than the golden ratio, the $ (-\beta)$-shift, as defined by S.
Ito and T. Sadahiro cannot be coded because its language is not transitive.
This intransitivity of words explains the existence of gaps in the interval. We
observe that an intransitive word appears in the $(-\beta)$-expansion of a real
number taken in the gap. Furthermore, we determine the Zeta function
$\zeta_{-\beta}$ of the $(-\beta)$-transformation and the associated
lap-counting function $L_{T_{-\beta}}$. These two functions are related by $
\zeta_{-\beta}=(1-z^2)L_{T_{-\beta}}$. We observe some similarities with the
zeta function of the $\beta$-transformation. The function $\zeta_{-\beta}$ is
meromorphic in the unit disk, is holomorphic in the open disk $ \{z |z| <
\frac{1}{\beta} \}$, has a simple pole at $ \frac{1}{\beta}$ and no other
singularities $ z $ such that $\|z| = \frac{1}{\beta}$. We also note an
influence of gaps ($\beta$ less than the golden ratio) on the zeta function. In
factors of the denominator of $\zeta_{-\beta}$, the coefficients count the
words generating gaps.

light-curve characteristics of the Blazhko stars is given. We analysed 8\,282
stars having the best quality data in the OGLE-IV survey, and found that at
least $40.3$\,\% of stars show modulation of their light curves. The number of
Blazhko stars we identified is 3\,341, which is the largest sample ever studied

combined data sets with OGLE-III observations, we found that 50\,\% of stars
that show unresolved close peaks to the main component in OGLE-IV are actually
Blazhko stars with extremely long periods. Blazhko stars with modulation occur
preferentially among RR Lyrae stars with shorter pulsation periods in the

light curves appear to be substantially lower for Blazhko stars than for stars
with unmodulated light curve in average. We derived new relations for the
compatibility parameter $D_{m}$ in $I$ passband and relations that allow for
differentiating modulated and non-modulated stars easily on the basis of
$R_{31}$, $\phi_{21}$ and $\phi_{31}$. Photometric metallicities, intrinsic

that these interactions have running coupling constants which spoil the
conformal invariance of the quantised theory, even in the 't Hooft limit. We
show that the running coupling constant in principle also affect the anomalous
dimensions of composite operators by calculating the $K=L$ loop leading order
wrapping corrections to the operators tr$\bigl(\phi_i^L)$. For the

investigate how the structure, mass and width of filamentary structures depend

ratio. We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both
qualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament
fitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with
almost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of
simulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little
structural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)
ionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure
significantly affects the formation of filaments. Analysis of the mass within
cores and filaments show decrease in mass as the degree of turbulence
increases. Finally, observed filaments within the Taurus L1495/B213 complex are
best reproduced by models with supercritical mass-to-flux ratios and/or at
least mildly supersonic turbulence, however, our models show that sterile
fibres observed within Taurus may occur in highly ionised, subcritical

eruptions are energized and evolve are vital unsolved problems in Heliophysics.
The standard model for solar eruptions summarizes our current understanding of
these events. Magnetic energy in the corona is released through drastic
restructuring of the magnetic field via reconnection. Electrons and ions are
then accelerated by poorly understood processes. Theories include contracting
loops, merging magnetic islands, stochastic acceleration, and turbulence at
shocks, among others. Although this basic model is well established, the
fundamental physics is poorly understood. HXR observations using
grazing-incidence focusing optics can now probe all of the key regions of the
standard model. These include two above-the-looptop (ALT) sources which bookend
the reconnection region and are likely the sites of particle acceleration and
direct heating. The science achievable by a direct HXR imaging instrument can
be summarized by the following science questions and objectives which are some
of the most outstanding issues in solar physics (1) How are particles
accelerated at the Sun? (1a) Where are electrons accelerated and on what time
scales? (1b) What fraction of electrons is accelerated out of the ambient
medium? (2) How does magnetic energy release on the Sun lead to flares and
eruptions? A Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) instrument, which can
be built now using proven technology and at modest cost, would enable
revolutionary advancements in our understanding of impulsive magnetic energy
release and particle acceleration, a process which is known to occur at the Sun

million degrees. However, despite its importance for the structure, dynamics,
and evolution of the solar atmosphere, the origin of this heating remains
poorly understood. Several observational and theoretical considerations suggest
that the heating is driven by small, impulsive energy bursts which could be
Parker-style ""nanoflares"" (Parker 1988) that arise via reconnection within the
tangled and twisted coronal magnetic field. The classical ""smoking gun""
(Klimchuk 2009; Cargill et al. 2013) for impulsive heating is the direct
detection of widespread hot plasma (T > 6 MK) with a low emission measure. In
recent years there has been great progress in the development of Transition
Edge Sensor (TES) X-ray microcalorimeters that make them more ideal for
studying the Sun. When combined with grazing-incidence focusing optics, they
provide direct spectroscopic imaging over a broad energy band (0.5 to 10 keV)
combined with extremely impressive energy resolution in small pixels, as low as
0.7 eV (FWHM) at 1.5 keV (Lee 2015), and 1.56 eV (FWHM) at 6 keV (Smith 2012),
two orders of magnitude better than the current best traditional solid state
photon-counting spectrometers. Decisive observations of the hot plasma
associated with nanoflare models of coronal heating can be provided by new
solar microcalorimeters. These measurements will cover the most important part
of the coronal spectrum for searching for the nanoflare-related hot plasma and
will characterize how much nanoflares can heat the corona both in active
regions and the quiet Sun. Finally, microcalorimeters will enable to study all
of this as a function of time and space in each pixel simultaneously a
capability never before available.

In this paper, fuzzy based knowledge engineering model has been developed for
sentiment classification of special group of such sentences including the

carried out on patient's reviews on several different cholesterol lowering

promising properties for novel excitonic devices, including a large binding

electroluminescence from interlayer excitons. At zero bias, the p-n junction
functions as a highly sensitive photodetector, where the wavelength-dependent
photocurrent measurement allows the direct observation of resonant optical
excitation of the interlayer exciton. The resulting photocurrent amplitude from
the interlayer exciton is about 200 times smaller compared to the resonant
excitation of intralayer exciton. This implies that the interlayer exciton
oscillator strength is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the

static envelope, outflow cavity, and disk. The evolution of a rotating
collapsing envelope can be constrained by the far-infrared/millimeter SED along
with the azimuthally-averaged radial intensity profile, and the structure of
the outflow cavity plays a critical role at shorter wavelengths. Emission at
20-40 um requires a cavity with a constant-density inner region and a power-law
density outer region. The best fit model has an envelope mass of 19 solar mass

The time since collapse began is 24630-44000 yr, most likely around 36000 yr.
The corresponding mass infall rate in the envelope (1.2x10$^{-5}$ solar mass

semi-supervised unmixing algorithms select members from an endmember library

mixing among the observed spectra. To address this issue, we develop an
endmember selection method using a recently proposed semantic spectral
representation obtained via non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain (NHMC) model
for a wavelet transform of the spectra. The semantic representation can encode
spectrally discriminative features for any observed spectrum and, therefore,
our proposed method can perform endmember selection without any assumption on

sufficiently nonlinear mixing our proposed method outperforms dictionary-based

larger than the atomic cooling threshold. The threshold halo mass at which gas
first collapses and cools increases with ionizing flux for intermediate values,
and saturates at a value approximately an order of magnitude above the atomic
cooling threshold for extremely high flux (e.g. $\approx 5 \times 10^8 ~

photoheating, ionization/recombination, and Ly$\alpha$ cooling in the

collapsing gas and find that a gas mass of up to $\approx 10^{6}~ M_\odot$ can
reach the central regions within $3~{\rm Myr}$, providing an upper limit on the

spatially imaged through local measurements of the critical Josephson current,
providing unprecedented insight into the nature of superconductivity. The
spatial form of the Josephson current reflects the nature of the defects, and
can be used to probe defect-induced phase transitions from an $S=0$ to an

recover high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR)
observations. The crux of this problem lies in learning the complex mapping
between low-resolution patches and the corresponding high-resolution patches.
Prior arts have used either a mixture of simple regression models or a single
non-linear neural network for this propose. This paper proposes the method of
learning a mixture of SR inference modules in a unified framework to tackle
this problem. Specifically, a number of SR inference modules specialized in
different image local patterns are first independently applied on the LR image
to obtain various HR estimates, and the resultant HR estimates are adaptively
aggregated to form the final HR image. By selecting neural networks as the SR
inference module, the whole procedure can be incorporated into a unified
network and be optimized jointly. Extensive experiments are conducted to
investigate the relation between restoration performance and different network
architectures. Compared with other current image SR approaches, our proposed
method achieves state-of-the-arts restoration results on a wide range of images
consistently while allowing more flexible design choices. The source codes are

update finite element models (FEMs). Model updating techniques use the measured

measured data are contaminated with experimental noise and the models are
inaccurate due to randomness in the parameters. This kind of aleatory
uncertainty is irreducible, and may decrease the accuracy of the finite element
model updating process. However, uncertainty quantification methods can be used
to identify the uncertainty in the updating parameters. In this paper, the
uncertainties associated with the modal parameters are defined as fuzzy
membership functions, while the model updating procedure is defined as an
optimization problem at each {\alpha}-cut level. To determine the membership
functions of the updated parameters, an objective function is defined and
minimized using two metaheuristic optimization algorithms: ant colony
optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). A structural example
is used to investigate the accuracy of the fuzzy model updating strategy using
the PSO and ACO algorithms. Furthermore, the results obtained by the fuzzy
finite element model updating are compared with the Bayesian model updating
results.

one of the most extreme forms of star formation. Understanding how SSCs form is
an observational challenge. Theoretical studies establish that, to form such
clusters, the dynamical timescale of their parent clouds has to be shorter than
the timescale of the disruption of their parent clouds by stellar feedback.
However, due to insufficient observational support, it is still unclear how
feedback from SSCs acts on their surrounding matter. Studying feedback in SSCs
is essential to understand how such clusters form. Based on ALMA and VLT
observations, we study this process in a SSC in the overlap region of the
Antennae galaxies. We analyze a unique massive (~10^7 Msun) and young (1-3.5
Myr) SSC, still associated with compact molecular and ionized gas emission. The
cluster has two CO velocity components, a low velocity one spatially associated
with the cluster and a high velocity one distributed in a bubble-like shape
around the cluster. Our results on the low velocity component suggest that this
gas did not participate in the formation of the SSC. We propose that most of
the parent cloud has already been blown away, accelerated at the early stages
of the SSC evolution by radiation pressure, in a timescale ~1 Myr. The high
velocity component may trace outflowing molecular gas from the parent cloud.
Supporting evidence is found in shock heated H2 gas. The low velocity component
may be gas that was near the SSC when it formed but not part of its parent
cloud or clumps that migrated from the SGMC environment. This gas would be
dispersed by stellar winds and supernova explosions. Within ~100 pc from the
cluster, we estimate SFE>17%, smaller than the theoretical limit of 30% needed
to form a bound cluster. Further higher spatial resolution observations are
needed to test and quantify our proposed scenario.

extensive simulation study and a real data application. We identify several
factors driving the relative performance of the estimators. The most important
one is the strength of dependence. No method was found to be uniformly better
than all others. Overall, the kernel estimators performed best, but do worse
than penalized B-spline estimators when there is weak dependence and no tail
dependence.

speech technology needs to be developed without transcriptions, pronunciation

zero-resource speech processing: (i) finding frame-level feature
representations which make it easier to discriminate between linguistic units
(phones or words), and (ii) segmenting and clustering unlabelled speech into
meaningful units. In this thesis, we argue that a combination of top-down and
bottom-up modelling is advantageous in tackling these two problems.
  To address the problem of frame-level representation learning, we present the
correspondence autoencoder (cAE), a neural network trained with weak top-down
supervision from an unsupervised term discovery system. By combining this
top-down supervision with unsupervised bottom-up initialization, the cAE yields
much more discriminative features than previous approaches. We then present our
unsupervised segmental Bayesian model that segments and clusters unlabelled
speech into hypothesized words. By imposing a consistent top-down segmentation
while also using bottom-up knowledge from detected syllable boundaries, our
system outperforms several others on multi-speaker conversational English and
Xitsonga speech data. Finally, we show that the clusters discovered by the
segmental Bayesian model can be made less speaker- and gender-specific by using
features from the cAE instead of traditional acoustic features.
  In summary, the different models and systems presented in this thesis show
that both top-down and bottom-up modelling can improve representation learning,
segmentation and clustering of unlabelled speech data.

specific parallel-programming tasks and describes how to approach them. In some
surprisingly common cases, these tasks can be automated.

underlying successful parallel-programming projects will free a new generation
of parallel hackers from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old
wheels, enabling them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new
frontiers. However, what you get from this book will be determined by what you
put into it. It is hoped that simply reading this book will be helpful, and
that working the Quick Quizzes will be even more helpful. However, the best

are perturbations of galaxies, protoplanetary discs or planetary systems. We
approximate such events as subset of the restricted three-body problem by
considering only perturbations of non-interacting low-mass objects initially on
circular Keplerian orbits. In this paper we present a new parametrisation of
the initial conditions of this problem. Under certain conditions the initial
positions of the low-mass objects can be specified largely independent of the
initial position of the perturber. Exploiting additionally the known scalings
of the problem reduces the parameter space of initial conditions for one
specific perturbation to two dimensions. To this two-dimensional initial
condition space we have related the final properties of the perturbed
trajectories of the low-mass objects from our numerical simulations. That way,
maps showing the effect of the perturbation on the low-mass objects have been
created, which provide a new view on the perturbation process. Comparing the
maps for different mass-ratios reveals that the perturbations by low- and
high-mass perturbers are dominated by different physical processes. The
equal-mass case is a complicated mixture of the other two cases. Since the
final properties of trajectories with similar initial conditions are usually
also similar, the results of the limited number of integrated trajectories can
be generalised to the full presented parameter space by interpolation. Since
our results are also unique within the accuracy strived for, they constitute
general numerical solutions for this subset of the restricted three-body

supernovae of Type Ia, and the peculiar and fainter Type Iax supernovae. Here
we study the impact of accretion-induced spin-up including the subsequent
magnetic field generation, angular momentum transport, and viscous heating on
the white dwarf evolution up to the point of helium ignition. We resolve the
structure of the helium accreting white dwarf models with a one dimensional
Langrangian hydrodynamic code, modified to include rotational and magnetic
effects. We find magnetic angular momentum transport, which leads to quasi
solid-body rotation, profoundly impacts the evolution of the white dwarf
models. Our rotating lower mass ($0.54$ and $0.82~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) models
accrete up to 50\% more mass up to ignition compared to the non-rotating case
and the opposite for our more massive models. Furthermore, we find that
rotation leads to up to 10-times smaller helium ignition densities, except for
the lowest adopted initial white dwarf mass. Ignition densities of order
$10^6\,\mathrm{g/cm}^3$ are only found for the lowest accretion rates and for
large amounts of accreted helium $\gtrsim 0.4\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. However,
correspondingly massive donor stars would transfer mass at much higher rates.
We expect explosive He-shell burning to mostly occur as deflagrations and at
$\dot{M}>2\cdot10^{-8}~\mathrm{M}_\odot/\mathrm{yr}$, regardless of white dwarf
mass. Our results imply that helium accretion onto CO white dwarfs at the
considered rates is unlikely to lead to explosions of the CO core or to

Gemini South telescope at a spatial resolution of $\approx$ 240pc, to assess
the feeding and feedback processes in this nearby AGN. We have identified two
gaseous kinematical components in the emission line profiles: a broader
component ($\sigma\approx$ 400km s$^{-1}$) which is observed in the inner
1-2arcsec and a narrower component ($\sigma\approx$ 200km s$^{-1}$) which is
present over the entire field-of-view. We identify the broader component as due
to an unresolved nuclear outflow. The narrower component velocity field shows
strong isovelocity twists relative to a rotation pattern, implying the presence
of strong non-circular motions. The subtraction of a rotational model reveals
that these twists are caused by outflowing gas in the inner $\approx$ 1arcsec,
and by inflows associated with two spiral arms at larger radii. We calculate an
ionized gas mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{out}\approx$
0.16M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. We calculate the net gas mass flow rate across a
series of concentric rings, obtaining a maximum mass inflow rate in ionized gas
of $\approx$ 2.8M$_{\odot}$year$^{-1}$ at 800pc from the nucleus, which is two
orders of magnitude larger than the accretion rate necessary to power this AGN.
However, as the mass inflow rate decreases at smaller radii, most of the gas
probably will not reach the AGN, but accumulate in the inner few hundred
parsecs. This will create a reservoir of gas that can trigger the formation of
new stars.

  Heating at z<2","13 pages, 6 figures, comments welcome!",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We systematically study, in the context of the standard cold dark matter
model, star-formation suppression effects of two important known physical
processes---photoheating due to reionization of the intergalactic medium and
gravitational shock heating due to formation of massive halos and large-scale
structure---on the global evolution of star formation rate (SFR) density and
the so-called cosmic downsizing phenomenon in the redshift range z=0-6. We show
that the steep decline of cosmic SFR density from z~2 to z=0 can be primarily
explained by gravitational shock heating in two forms: massive halo
self-quenching and hot environment. Simultaneously, we show a decreasing trend
in the average SFR of star-forming galaxies from z=2 to z=0, reproducing the
observed cosmic downsizing at z<2. Nevertheless, the average halo mass of
star-forming galaxies is found to continue upsizing from z=2 to z=0. In stark
contrast to z<2, both photoheating and gravitational shock heating effects are
found to play a minor role in suppressing star formation. Additional negative
feedback effects are required to reconcile our model with observations at z>2.
Internal feedback from stellar evolution and supermassive black hole growth are
the natural candidates for this role, as galaxies at z>2 are more moderate in
mass but stronger in star formation and are thus more vulnerable. Our physical
model can be used to treat star formation in cosmological N-body simulations.

isochores and adiabats are identical. So one cannot simply apply the paradigm
in the former literatures. However, if one introduces a new thermodynamic
parameter associated with the renormalization length scale, the above problem
can be solved. We obtain the analytical efficiency expression of the

Moreover, we double check with the exact formula. Our result presents the first
specific example for the sound correctness of the exact efficiency formula. We
argue that the three-dimensional charged BTZ black hole can be viewed as a toy
model for further investigation of holographic heat engine. Furthermore, we
compare our result with that of the Carnot cycle and extend the former result
to three-dimensional spacetime. In this sense, the result in this paper would
be complementary to those obtained in four-dimensional spacetime or ever
higher. Last but not the least, the heat engine efficiency discussed in this

sky emission from ultraviolet to optical wavelengths, which is composed of the
zodiacal light (ZL), diffuse Galactic light (DGL), and residual emission. The
observations were performed toward 54 fields distributed widely over the sky,
with the spectral coverage from 0.2 to 0.7 um. In order to avoid contaminating
light from the earthshine, we use the data collected only in orbital nighttime.
The observed intensity is decomposed into the ZL, DGL, and residual emission,
in eight photometric bands spanning our spectral coverage. We found that the
derived ZL reflectance spectrum is flat in the optical, which indicates major
contribution of C-type asteroids to the interplanetary dust (IPD). In addition,
the ZL reflectance spectrum has an absorption feature at ~0.3 um. The shape of
the DGL spectrum is consistent with those found in earlier measurements and
model predictions. While the residual emission contains a contribution from the
extragalactic background light, we found that the spectral shape of the
residual looks similar to the ZL spectrum. Moreover, its optical intensity is
much higher than that measured from beyond the IPD cloud by Pioneer10/11, and
also than that of the integrated galaxy light. These findings may indicate the
presence of an isotropic ZL component, which is missed in the conventional ZL
models.

applies the main concepts of traditional physics to economics, typically
consist of large systems of economic agents who are characterized by the amount
of money they have. In the simplest model, at each time step, one agent gives
one dollar to another agent, with both agents being chosen independently and
uniformly at random from the system. Numerical simulations of this model
suggest that, at least when the number of agents and the average amount of
money per agent are large, the distribution of money converges to an
exponential distribution reminiscent of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of
energy in physics. The main objective of this paper is to give a rigorous proof
of this result and show that the convergence to the exponential distribution is
universal in the sense that it holds more generally when the economic agents
are located on the vertices of a connected graph and interact locally with
their neighbors rather than globally with all the other agents. We also study a
closely related model where, at each time step, agents buy with a probability
proportional to the amount of money they have, and prove that in this case the
limiting distribution of money is Poissonian.

4-7 Myr age, and signs of a fairly constant long-term star formation of the
underlying stellar population. The most massive nucleus, in contrast, is
quenched with a starburst age of >40 Myr and shows hints of budding AGN
activity. The secondary massive nucleus is at an intermediate stage. The two
major components have a population of older stars, consistent with a starburst
triggered 1 Gyr ago in a first encounter. The simplest explanation of the
history is that of a triple merger, where the strongly star forming component
has joined later. We detect multiple gas flows in different phases. The Bird
offers an opportunity to witness multiple stages of galaxy evolution in the

AGN activity. It also serves as a cautionary note on interpretations of

nonparametric methods, including a generalization of Kendall's tau test, for
doubly truncated data. Motivated by their approach, as well as by the work of
Bhattacharya et al. (1983) for right truncated data, we proposed a general
method for estimating the regression parameter when the dependent variable is
subject to the double truncation. It extends the Mann-Whitney-type rank
estimator and can be computed easily by existing software packages. We show
that the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. A
resampling scheme is proposed with large sample justification for approximating
the limiting distribution. The quasar data in Efron and Petrosian (1999) are
re-analyzed by the new method. Simulation results show that the proposed method
works well. Extension to weighted rank estimation are also given.

that local temporal dependencies can be retained and are globally consistent in
the resulting interval network. Moreover, network structure can be learned from

be effectively achieved by a biased user association scheme with which each
user chooses to associate with one base station (BS) based on the biased
received power. In contrast to previous studies where a BS always has packets
to transmit, we assume in this paper that incoming packets intended for all the
associated users form a queue in the BS. In order to find the delay limit of
the network to support real-time service, we focus on the delay optimization
problem by properly tuning the biasing factor of each tier. By adopting a
thinned Poisson point process (PPP) model to characterize the locations of BSs
in the busy state, an explicit expression of the average traffic intensity of
each tier is obtained. On that basis, an optimization problem is formulated to
minimize a lower bound of the network mean queuing delay. By showing that the
optimization problem is convex, the optimal biasing factor of each tier can be
obtained numerically. When the mean packet arrival rate of each user is small,
a closed-form solution is derived. The simulation results demonstrate that the
network queuing performance can be significantly improved by properly tuning
the biasing factor. It is further shown that the network mean queuing delay
might be improved at the cost of a deterioration of the network
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage, which indicates a performance
tradeoff between real-time and non-real-time traffic in HetNets.

Contrary to previous claims that a direct transition from a WSM to a diffusive

two distinct metallic phases should exist due to internode scattering that is
comparable to intranode scattering. The critical exponent of localization
length is $\nu\simeq 1.3$ for both the WSM-CI and CI-DM transitions, in the
same universality class of 3D Gaussian unitary ensemble of the Anderson
localization transition. The CI phase is confirmed by quantized nonzero Hall
conductances in the bulk insulating phase established by localization length
calculations. The disorder-induced various plateau-plateau transitions in both
the WSM and CI phases are observed and explained by the self-consistent Born
approximation. Furthermore, we clarify that the occurrence of zero density of
states at Weyl nodes is not a good criterion for the disordered WSM, and there
is no fundamental principle to support the hypothesis of divergence of
localization length at the WSM-DM transition.

density; this is consistent with extrinsic effects of jet disruption driving
the FR dichotomy. Using matched samples of HERGs and LERGs, we show that HERG
host galaxies are more frequently star-forming, with more evidence for

spectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars,
SpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (Teff), 15%
in stellar radius (Rstar), and 0.09 dex in metallicity [Fe/H]. Because the code
relies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars ~K4 and
later which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers,
reaching accuracies of 70 K in Teff, 10% in Rstar, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We
also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at
lower spectral resolution and SNR, enabling the characterization of faint
late-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are
publicly available.

this direction, it is known (Saari, 2014) that an optimal lower bound for the
number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$ is
$\lceil\log_{\phi}(n) + 1\rceil$, where $\phi$ denotes the golden ratio $(1 +

probe the surface spin canting in nanoparticles of two technologically
important magnetic materials, i.e. Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 (CFO). A soft experimental
technique is developed that is capable of extracting EELS spectra with one
atomic plane resolution recorded in a single frame. This yields information at
different depth of the nanoparticle from the surface to the core regions with
high signal to noise ratio and without beam damage. This enables comparing the
fine structures between the surface and core regions of the nanoparticles. The
results confirm earlier observations of uniformly oriented spin canting
structure for CFO with additional information on atom site-selective spin
canting information. In case of Fe3O4 preferred canting orientation forming
core and shell structure is deduced. Unlike earlier reports based on polarized
spin-flip neutron scattering measurement, it is possible to narrow down the
possible canting angles for Fe3O4 (Td, Oh tilts 40{\deg}, 40{\deg}) and CFO
(Td, Oh tilts 17{\deg}, 17{\deg}) from the experimental spectra combined with
the first principle based calculation considering non-collinear magnetism. In
addition, the role of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in stabilizing the spin
canting at the nanoparticle surface is discussed. The results demonstrate that
HREELS can be a powerful technique to probe the magnetic structure in
nano-dimensional systems and has advantages over neutron based techniques in

question we consider a general model of hierarchically organized self-renewing
tissues and show that the lifetime divisional load of such a tissue is
independent of the details of the cell differentiation processes, and depends
only on two structural and two dynamical parameters. Our results demonstrate
that a strict analytical relationship exists between two seemingly disparate
characteristics of self-renewing tissues: divisional load and tissue
organization. Most remarkably, we find that a sufficient number of
progressively slower dividing cell types can be almost as efficient in
minimizing the divisional load, as non-renewing tissues. We argue that one of
the main functions of tissue-specific stem cells and differentiation
hierarchies is the prevention of cancer.

also analyse the nature of the density field in real space by studying the
large-distance behavior of the two-point pair correlation function, of density
fluctuations in subsystems of increasing sizes, and of the direct correlation
function. We show that such real space analysis can be greatly improved by
introducing a coarse-grained density field to disentangle genuine large-scale

absent, indicating that randomly jammed packings are not hyperuniform. In
addition, we establish that the pair correlation function displays a
surprisingly complex structure at large distances, which is however not
compatible with the long-range negative correlation of hyperuniform systems but
fully compatible with an analytic form for the structure factor. This implies
that the direct correlation function is short-ranged, as we also demonstrate
directly. Our results reveal that density fluctuations in jammed packings do
not follow the behavior expected for random hyperuniform materials, but display

problems. First, the minima of the objective function used in learning
correspond to data points (also known as rubbish examples or fooling images)
that lack semantic similarity with the training data. Second, a clean input can
be changed by a small, and often imperceptible for human vision, perturbation,
so that the resulting deformed input is misclassified by the network. These
findings emphasize the differences between the ways DNN and humans classify
patterns, and raise a question of designing learning algorithms that more
accurately mimic human perception compared to the existing methods.
  Our paper examines these questions within the framework of Dense Associative
Memory (DAM) models. These models are defined by the energy function, with
higher order (higher than quadratic) interactions between the neurons. We show
that in the limit when the power of the interaction vertex in the energy
function is sufficiently large, these models have the following three
properties. First, the minima of the objective function are free from rubbish
images, so that each minimum is a semantically meaningful pattern. Second,
artificial patterns poised precisely at the decision boundary look ambiguous to
human subjects and share aspects of both classes that are separated by that
decision boundary. Third, adversarial images constructed by models with small
power of the interaction vertex, which are equivalent to DNN with rectified
linear units (ReLU), fail to transfer to and fool the models with higher order
interactions. This opens up a possibility to use higher order models for
detecting and stopping malicious adversarial attacks. The presented results
suggest that DAM with higher order energy functions are closer to human visual

variations in the Baetica cluster, a group of relatively young craters close to
the north pole. As Lutetia remains a poorly understood asteroid, such color
variations may provide clues to the nature of its surface. We take the color
analysis one step further. First we orthorectify the images using a shape model
and improved camera pointing, then apply a variety of techniques (photometric
correction, principal component analysis) to the resulting color cubes. We
characterize variegation in the Baetica crater cluster at high spatial
resolution, identifying crater rays and small, fresh impact craters. We argue
that at least some of the color variation is due to space weathering, which
makes Lutetia's regolith redder and brighter.

propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the

segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of
those morphemes. We experiment with the model on English CELEX data and German

increases both segmentation accuracy and morpheme F1 by between 3% and 5%.

abelian-square factors, that is, distinct factors that are abelian squares.
This motivates us to study infinite words such that the number of distinct
abelian-square factors of length $n$ grows quadratically with $n$. More
precisely, we say that an infinite word $w$ is {\it abelian-square-rich} if,
for every $n$, every factor of $w$ of length $n$ contains, on average, a number
of distinct abelian-square factors that is quadratic in $n$; and {\it uniformly

abelian-square-rich, but we show that the converse is not true in general. We

approach of the robust point matching method, we model point matching as a
mixed linear assignment-least square problem and show that after eliminating
the transformation variable, the resulting problem of minimization with respect
to point correspondence is a concave optimization problem. Furthermore, this
problem has the property that the objective function can be converted into a
form with few nonlinear terms via a linear transformation. Based on these
properties, we employ the branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm to optimize the
resulting problem where the dimension of the search space is small. To further
improve efficiency of the BnB algorithm where computation of the lower bound is
the bottleneck, we propose a new lower bounding scheme which has a
k-cardinality linear assignment formulation and can be efficiently solved.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness to disturbances and point

making the SEB ($7-17^\circ$ S) as opaque in the thermal infrared as the
adjacent equatorial zone. After the cessation of discrete convective activity
within the SEB in May 2009, a cool quiescent band of high aerosol opacity (the
SEB zone at $11-15^\circ$ S) was observed separating the cloud-free northern

contrasts of $1.0\pm0.5$ K), as well as the increased aerosol opacity at 4.8

chain of five warm, cloud-free `brown barges' (subsiding airmasses) were

they too had been obscured by the enhanced aerosol opacity of the SEB, although
the underlying warm circulation was still present in July 2010. The cool
temperatures and enhanced aerosol opacity of the SEBZ after July 2009 are
consistent with an upward flux of volatiles from deeper levels (e.g.,
ammonia-laden air) and enhanced condensation, obscuring the blue-absorbing
chromophore and whitening the SEB by April 2010. Revival of the dark SEB
coloration in the coming months will ultimately require sublimation of these

since the PEV users need to obtain system information (e.g., locations of
charging/discharging stations, current load and supply of the power grid) to
achieve the best charging and discharging performance, data communication plays
a crucial role. However, since the PEV users are highly mobile, information
from V2G systems is not always available for many reasons, e.g., wireless link
failures and cyber attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel
concept using cyber insurance to ""transfer"" cyber risks, e.g., unavailable

Under the insurance coverage, even without information about V2G systems, a PEV
user is always guaranteed the best price for charging/discharging. In
particular, we formulate the optimal energy cost problem for the PEV user by
adopting a Markov decision process framework. We then propose a learning
algorithm to help the PEV user make optimal decisions, e.g., to charge or
discharge and to buy or not to buy insurance, in an online fashion. Through
simulations, we show that cyber insurance is an efficient solution not only in
dealing with cyber risks, but also in maximizing revenue of the PEV user.

that control star formation efficiency: compressive motions, as opposed to
solenoidal motions, can trigger the collapse of cores, or mark the expansion of
Hii regions. We try to observationally derive the fractions of momentum density
($\rho v$) contained in the solenoidal and compressive modes of turbulence in
the Orion B molecular cloud and relate these fractions to the star formation
efficiency in the cloud. The implementation of a statistical method developed
by Brunt & Federrath (2014), applied to a $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) datacube obtained
with the IRAM-30m telescope, allows us to retrieve 3-dimensional quantities
from the projected quantities provided by the observations, yielding an
estimate of the compressive versus solenoidal ratio in various regions of the
cloud. Despite the Orion B molecular cloud being highly supersonic (mean Mach
number $\sim$ 6), the fractions of motion in each mode diverge significantly
from equipartition. The cloud's motions are on average mostly solenoidal
(excess > 8 % with respect to equipartition), which is consistent with its low
star formation rate. On the other hand, the motions around the main
star-forming regions (NGC 2023 and NGC 2024) prove to be strongly compressive.
We have successfully applied to observational data a method that was so far
only tested on simulations, and have shown that there can be a strong
intra-cloud variability of the compressive and solenoidal fractions, these
fractions being in turn related to the star formation efficiency. This opens a
new possibility for star-formation diagnostics in galactic molecular clouds.

  Wireless Sensor Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is
crucial that the network is able to detect anomalies in communication quality
(e.g., RSSI), which may cause performance degradation, so that the network can
react accordingly. In this paper, we introduce RADIUS, a lightweight system for
the purpose. The design of RADIUS is aimed at minimizing the detection error
(caused by normal randomness of RSSI) in discriminating good links from weak
links and at reaching high detection accuracy under diverse link conditions and
dynamic environment changes. Central to the design is a threshold-based
decision approach that has its foundation on the Bayes decision theory. In
RADIUS, various techniques are developed to address challenges inherent in
applying this approach. In addition, through extensive experiments, proper
configuration of the parameters involved in these techniques is identified for
an indoor environment. In a prototype implementation of the RADIUS system
deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that RADIUS is accurate in
detecting anomalous link quality degradation for all links across the network,
maintaining a stable error rate of 6.13% on average.

whitened state in 2009-2010 to its normal brown appearance is documented via
comparisons of thermal-infrared (5-20 $\mu$m) and visible-light imaging between
November 2010 and November 2011. The SEB revival consisted of convective
eruptions triggered over $\sim100$ days, potentially powered by the latent heat
released by the condensation of water. The plumes rise from the water cloud
base and ultimately diverge and cool in the stably-stratified upper
troposphere. Thermal-IR images were acquired 2 days after the SEB disturbance
was first detected by amateur observers on November 9th 2010. Subsequent images
revealed the cold, putatively anticyclonic and cloudy plume tops surrounded by
warm, cloud-free conditions at their peripheries. The majority of the plumes
erupted from a single source near $140-160^\circ$W, coincident with the remnant
cyclonic circulation of a brown barge that had formed during the fade.
Additional plumes erupted from the leading edge of the central disturbance
immediately east of the source. The tropospheric plumes excited stratospheric
thermal waves over the SEB, showing a direct connection between moist
convection and stratospheric wave activity. The subsidence of dry, unsaturated
air warmed the troposphere and removed the white aerosols. The aerosol-free air
was redistributed throughout the SEB by the zonal flow, following a
westward-moving southern branch and an eastward-moving northern branch that
revived the brown colouration over $\sim200$ days. The last stage of the
revival was the re-establishment of normal convective activity northwest of the
GRS in September 2011. Moist convection may therefore play an important role in
controlling the timescale and atmospheric variability during the SEB life
cycle. [Abridged]

reveal the emergence of a coronal sigmoid through the interaction between two
J-shaped bundles of loops which proceeds with multiple episodes of coronal loop
brightenings and significant variations in the magnetic flux through the
photosphere. These observations imply that repetitive magnetic reconnections
likely play a key role in the formation of the sigmoidal flux rope in the
corona and also contribute toward sustaining the temperature of the flux rope
higher than the ambient coronal structures. Notably, the formation of the
sigmoid is associated with the fast morphological evolution of an S-shaped
filament channel in the chromosphere. The sigmoid activates toward eruption
with the ascend of a large flux rope in the corona which is preceded by the
decrease of photospheric magnetic flux through the core flaring region
suggesting tether-cutting reconnection as a possible triggering mechanism. The
flux rope eruption results in a two-ribbon M6.5 flare with a prolonged rise
phase of ~21 min. The flare exhibits significant deviation from the standard

\cite{IyaSol} independently introduced and characterised algebras with dominant
dimension coinciding with the Gorenstein dimension and both dimensions being
larger than or equal to two. In \cite{IyaSol}, such algebras are named
Auslander-Gorenstein algebras. Auslander-Gorenstein algebras generalise the
well known class of higher Auslander algebras, where the dominant dimension
additionally coincides with the global dimension. In this article we generalise
Auslander-Gorenstein algebras further to algebras having the property that the
dominant dimension coincides with the finitistic dimension and both dimension
are at least two. We call such algebras finitistic Auslander algebras. As an
application we can specialise to reobtain known results about
Auslander-Gorenstein algebras and higher Auslander algebras such as the higher
Auslander correspondence with a very short proof. We then give several
conjectures and classes of examples for finitistic Auslander algebras. For a
local Hopf algebra $A$ and an indecomposable non-projective $A$-module $M$, we
show that $End_A(A \oplus M)$ is always a finitistic Auslander algebra of

non-zero, which generalises a result of Tachikawa who proved that $Ext_A^1(M,M)
\neq 0$ for indecomposable non-projective modules $M$ over group algebras of
$p$-groups. We furthermore conjecture that every algebra of dominant dimension
at least two which has exactly one projective non-injective indecomposable
module is a finitistic Auslander algebra. We prove this conjecture for a large
class of algebras which includes all representation-finite algebras.

the temporal lag in the STARIMA model, where the temporal lag is formulated as
a function of the spatial lag (spatial distance) and the average speed.
Secondly, an unsupervised classification algorithm based on ISODATA algorithm

time lag to use in the STARIMA model. Finally, a STARIMA-based model with

composition before and after the mixing takes place in the convective envelope
of subgiant stars are necessary. Stellar evolution models can provide us with
such predictions, although a comparision with objects of known age is needed
for calibration. Open clusters are excellent test cases, as they represent a
single stellar population for which the age can be derived through, e.g.,
isochrone fitting. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of stars
belonging to the well-known open cluster M67 observed by the APOGEE survey in
the twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and whose chemical
properties were derived with the ASPCAP pipeline. We find that the [C/N]
abundance of subgiant branch stars is overestimated by $\sim0.2$ dex due to an
offset in the determination of the [N/Fe] abundance. Stars on the red giant
branch and red clump are shown not to be affected by this offset. We derive
$\text{[C/N]}_{FDU}=-0.46\pm 0.03$ dex, which poses a strong constraint on
calibrations of $\text{[C/N]}_{FDU}$ as age indicator. We also do not find any
clear signature of additional chemical mixing processes that set in after the
red giant branch bump. The results obtained for M67 indicate the importance of
conducting high-resolution spectroscopic studies of open clusters of different

  Networks (DSN'17), Denver, USA, 26-29 June 2017",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Novel hardware-aided trusted execution environments, as provided by Intel's
Software Guard Extensions (SGX), enable to execute applications in a secure
context that enforces confidentiality and integrity of the application state
even when the host system is misbehaving. While this paves the way towards
secure and trustworthy cloud computing, essential system support to protect
persistent application state against rollback and forking attacks is missing.
  In this paper we present LCM - a lightweight protocol to establish a
collective memory amongst all clients of a remote application to detect
integrity and consistency violations. LCM enables the detection of rollback
attacks against the remote application, enforces the consistency notion of
fork-linearizability and notifies clients about operation stability. The
protocol exploits the trusted execution environment, complements it with simple
client-side operations, and maintains only small, constant storage at the
clients. This simplifies the solution compared to previous approaches, where
the clients had to verify all operations initiated by other clients. We have
implemented LCM and demonstrated its advantages with a key-value store
application. The evaluation shows that it introduces low network and
computation overhead; in particular, a LCM-protected key-value store achieves
0.72x - 0.98x of a SGX-secured key-value store throughput.

networks with spatially (Poisson) distributed eavesdroppers (EDs) under the
assumption that the base station employs transmit antenna selection (TAS) to
enhance secrecy performance. We compare the cases where the receiving user
equipment (UE) operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and full-duplex (FD) mode. In
the latter case, the UE simultaneously receives the intended downlink message
and transmits a jamming signal to strengthen secrecy. We investigate two models
of (semi)passive eavesdropping: (1) EDs act independently and (2) EDs collude
to intercept the transmitted message. For both of these models, we obtain
expressions for the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for HD and FD UE
operation. The expressions for HD systems have very accurate approximate or
exact forms in terms of elementary and/or special functions for all path loss
exponents. Those related to the FD systems have exact integral forms for
general path loss exponents, while exact closed forms are given for specific
exponents. A closed-form approximation is also derived for the FD case with
colluding EDs. The resulting analysis shows that the reduction in the secrecy
outage probability is logarithmic in the number of antennas used for TAS and
identifies conditions under which HD operation should be used instead of FD
jamming at the UE. These performance trends and exact relations between system
parameters can be used to develop adaptive power allocation and duplex
operation methods in practice. Examples of such techniques are alluded to
herein.

event estimation, survival biasing and composite emission biasing to improve
signal-to-noise of the output.For cloud particle scattering events, a
log-normal area distribution is constructed from the 3D cloud formation RHD
results and stochastically sampled in order to model the Rayleigh and Mie
scattering behaviour of a mixture of grain sizes. Stellar photon packets
incident on the eastern dayside hemisphere show predominantly Rayleigh,
single-scattering behaviour, while multiple-scattering occurs on the western
hemisphere. Combined scattered and thermal emitted light predictions are
consistent with published HST and Spitzer secondary transit observations. Our
model predictions are also consistent with geometric albedo constraints from
optical wavelength ground based polarimetry and HST B-band measurements. We
predict an apparent geometric albedo for HD 189733b of 0.205 and 0.229, in the

disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance) of new varieties is a key
component of crop performance improvement. However, the variety testing process
is presently exclusively based on experimental field approaches which
inherently reduces the number and the diversity of experienced combinations of
varieties x environmental conditions in regard of the multiplicity of growing
conditions within the cultivation area. Our aim is to make a greater and faster
use of the information issuing from these trials using crop modeling and
simulation to amplify the environmental and agronomic conditions in which the
new varieties are tested.
  In this study, we present a model-based approach to assist variety testing
and implement this approach on sunflower crop, using the SUNFLO simulation
model and a subset of 80 trials from a large multi-environment trial (MET)
conducted each year by agricultural extension services to compare newly
released sunflower hybrids. After estimating parameter values (using plant
phenotyping) to account for new genetic material, we independently evaluated
the model prediction capacity on the MET (model accuracy was 54.4 %) and its
capacity to rank commercial hybrids for performance level (Kendall's $\tau$ =
0.41, P < 0.01). We then designed a numerical experiment by combining the
previously tested genetic and new cropping conditions (2100 virtual trials) to
determine the best varieties and related management in representative French
production regions.
  We suggest that this approach could find operational outcomes to recommend
varieties according to environment types. Such spatial management of genetic
resources could potentially improve crop performance by reducing the
genotype-phenotype mismatch in farming environments.

Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations to estimate the amount of X-ray flux
reprocessed by HD189733b. Despite its extended evaporating-atmosphere, we find
that the X-ray absorption radius of HD189733b at 0.7keV, the mean energy of the
photons detected in the 0.25--2 keV energy band by XMM-Newton, is $\sim$1.01
times the planetary radius for an atmosphere of atomic Hydrogen and Helium
(including ions), and produces a maximum depth of $\sim$2.1% at
$\sim$$\pm46$~min from the center of the planetary transit on the geometrically
thick and optically thin corona. We compute numerically in the 0.25--2keV
energy band that this maximum depth is only of $\sim$1.6% at $\sim$$\pm47$~min
from the transit center, and little sensitive to the metal abundance assuming
that adding metals in the atmosphere would not dramatically change the
density-temperature profile. Regarding a direct detection of HD189733b in
X-rays, we find that the amount of flux reprocessed by the exoplanetary
atmosphere varies with the orbital phase, spanning between 3--5 orders of
magnitude fainter than the flux of the primary star. Additionally, the degree
of linear polarization emerging from HD 189733b is $<$0.003%, with maximums
detected near planetary greatest elongations. This implies that both the
modulation of the X-ray flux with the orbital phase and the scattered-induced
continuum polarization cannot be observed with current X-ray facilities.

our entire society so that what is a personal novelty can turn into an
innovation at a global level. Innovations occur throughout social, biological

newest model of Polya's urn with triggering of one novelty by another. What
seems to be key in the successful modelling schemes proposed so far is the idea
of looking at evolution as a path in a complex space, physical, conceptual,

Benefiting from training on a large dataset, the obtained compressive sensing

alternatively termed particle filters. The variance estimator that we propose
is a natural modification of that suggested by H. P. Chan and T. L. Lai [A
general theory of particle filters in hidden Markov models and some
applications. Ann. Statist., 41(6):2877-2904, 2013], which allows the variance
to be estimated in a single run of the particle filter by tracing the
genealogical history of the particles. However, due particle lineage
degeneracy, the estimator of the mentioned work becomes numerically unstable as
the number of sequential particle updates increases. Thus, by tracing only a
part of the particles' genealogy rather than the full one, our estimator gains
long-term numerical stability at the cost of a bias. The scope of the
genealogical tracing is regulated by a lag, and under mild, easily checked
model assumptions, we prove that the bias tends to zero geometrically fast as
the lag increases. As confirmed by our numerical results, this allows the bias
to be tightly controlled also for moderate particle sample sizes.

studied for a pulse length range from 500 fs to 4.5 ps and a fluence range
spanning 0.9 to 22 J/cm^2. The ablation depth and volume are obtained employing
a high-numerical-aperture optical microscope, while the ion yield and energy
distributions are obtained from a set of Faraday cups set up under various
angles. We found a slight increase of the ion yield for an increasing pulse
length, while the ablation depth is slightly decreasing. The ablation volume
remained constant as a function of pulse length. The ablation depth follows a
two-region logarithmic dependence on the fluence, in agreement with the
available literature and theory. In the examined fluence range, the ion yield
angular distribution is sharply peaked along the target normal at low fluences
but rapidly broadens with increasing fluence. The total ionization fraction
increases monotonically with fluence to a 5-6% maximum, which is substantially
lower than the typical ionization fractions obtained with nanosecond-pulse
ablation. The angular distribution of the ions does not depend on the laser
pulse length within the measurement uncertainty. These results are of
particular interest for the possible utilization of fs-ps laser systems in
plasma sources of extreme ultraviolet light for nanolithography.

expressed in the form of power series with respect to the resonance parameter

ordered according to their relative stabilities and thereby importances when
building up the actual electronic structures. To rationalize the results,
interrelations are sought between separate members of the power series, on the
one hand, and presence of definite substructures in the given Kekule structure,

of the relevant Kekule valence structures along with the usual rings consisting
of uniform double and single bonds alternately and known as conjugated

multicomponent systems. For this purpose, we have examined the phase separation
pattern of a binary mixture (AB) in presence of stationary spherical particles
(C) which prefers one of the components of the binary (say, A). Binary AB is
composed of critical composition(50:50) and off-critical compositions(60:40,
40:60). Particle sizes of 8 units and 16 units are used in the simulations. Two
types of particle loading are used, 5\% and 10\%. We have employed a ternary
form of Cahn-Hilliard equation to incorporate immobile fillers in our system.
To elucidate the effect of wetting on phase separation we have designed three
sets of $\chi_{ij}$ and $\kappa_{ij}$ to include the effects of neutral
preference, weak preference and strong preference of the particle for one of
the binary components. If the particles are preferentially wetted by one of the
components then early stage microstructures show transient concentric alternate
layers of preferred and non-preferred phases around the particles. When
particles are neutral to binary components then such a ring pattern does not
form. At late times, neutral preference between particles and binary components
yields a continuous morphology whereas preferential wetting produces isolated
domains of non-preferred phases dispersed in a continuous matrix of preferred
phase. For off-critical compositions, if minor component wets the particle then
a bicontinuous morphology results whereas if major component wets the network a
droplet morphology is seen. When majority component wets the particle, a
possibility of double phase separation is reported. In such alloys phase
separation starts near the particle surface and propagates to the bulk at
intermediate to late times forming spherical or nearly spherical droplets of
the minor component.

instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to the mechanical
yield. The theory, the order parameter used and the correlation functions which
exhibit the divergent correlation length are universal in nature and can be
applied to any amorphous solids that undergo mechanical yield.

single-slip-to-single-plane relaxation of single-crystal, strain-gradient
elastoplasticity with $L^p$-hardening penalty. In these relaxed models, where
only one slip-plane normal can be activated at each material point, the main
challenge is to show that the energy of geometrically necessary dislocations is
lower-semicontinuous along bounded-energy sequences which satisfy the
single-plane condition, meaning precisely that this side condition should be
preserved in the weak $L^p$-limit. This is done with the aid of an 'exclusion'
lemma of Conti \& Ortiz, which essentially allows one to put a lower bound on
the dislocation energy at interfaces of (single-plane) slip patches, thus
precluding fine phase-mixing in the limit. Furthermore, using div-curl
techniques in the spirit of Mielke \& M\""uller, we are able to show that the
usual multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into plastic and
elastic parts interacts with weak convergence and the single-plane constraint
in such a way as to guarantee lower-semicontinuity of the (polyconvex) elastic
energy, and hence the total elasto-plastic energy, given sufficient ($p>2$)

have formed, we follow the evolution and enrichment of the gas and the time
dependence of stellar mass. A key assumption is that interactions between
massive stars are important at high density, including interactions between
massive stars and massive star binaries that can shred stellar envelopes.
Massive-star interactions should also scatter low-mass stars out of the
cluster. Reasonable agreement with the observations is obtained for a cloud
core mass of ~4x10^6 M_sun and a density of ~2x10^6 cm^{-3}. The results depend
primarily on a few dimensionless parameters, including, most importantly, the
ratio of the gas consumption time to the lifetime of a massive star, which has
to be low, ~10%, and the efficiency of scattering low-mass stars per unit
dynamical time, which has to be relatively large, such as a few percent. Also
for these conditions, the velocity dispersions of embedded globular clusters
should be comparable to the high gas dispersions of galaxies at that time, so
that stellar ejection by multi-star interactions could cause low-mass stars to
leave a dwarf galaxy host altogether. This could solve the problem of missing
first-generation stars in the halos of Fornax and WLM.

provides a further improvement of the classical P\'{o}lya-Vinogradov inequality

have $$M(\chi)\ll_{\varepsilon} \sqrt{q}(\log q)^{1-\delta_g}(\log\log

finite automata into a network allows for more computational power. One such
network, called a cellular automaton, consists of an n-dimensional array for n

the oldest problems associated with cellular automata is the firing

emphasis on solutions that were published after 1998. We also focus on
solutions that minimize the number of states required by the finite automata.

This group generalizes the definition of the Jacobian group (also known as the

  There are many explicit combinatorial bijections in the literature between

G}(M)$ of circuit-cocircuit reversal classes of $M$, and then define a family
of combinatorial bijections $\beta_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$ between ${\mathcal G}(M)$

the set of circuits (resp. cocircuits) of $M$.) We then give a geometric
interpretation of each such map $\beta=\beta_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$ in terms of

point group $G$ are able to describe any 3-D object which exhibits the
rotational point group symmetry. However, in order to characterize the spatial
statistics of an ensemble of objects in which each object is different but the
statistics exhibit the symmetry, a complete set of basis functions is required.
In particular, for each irreducible representation (irrep) of $G$, it is
necessary to include basis functions that transform according to that irrep.
This complete set of basis functions is a basis for square-integrable functions
on the surface of the sphere in 3-D. Because the objects are real-valued, it is
convenient to have real-valued basis functions. In this paper, the existence of
such real-valued bases is proven and an algorithm for their computation is
provided for the icosahedral $I$ and the octahedral $O$ symmetries.
Furthermore, it is proven that such a real-valued basis does not exist for the
tetrahedral $T$ symmetry because some irreps of $T$ are essentially complex.
The importance of these basis functions to computations in single-particle
cryo-electron microscopy is described.

Simulations showed that a model based on established properties of point
defects (PDs) generation, reaction, clustering, and cluster dissociation, is
unable to predict black spot defects distribution consistent with STEM
observations. This failure suggests that additional phenomena not included in a
simple point-defect picture may contribute to radiation-induced evolution of
defect clusters in SiC and using our model we have determined the effects of a
number of these additional phenomena on cluster evolution. Using these
additional phenomena it is possible to fit parameters within physically

retention and monetization two central analytics metrics in games. Player
retention may refer to various duration variables quantifying product use:
total playtime or session playtime are popular research targets, and active
playtime is well-suited for subscription games. Such research often has the
goal of increasing player retention or conversely decreasing player churn.
Survival analysis is a framework of powerful tools well suited for retention
type data. This paper contributes new methods to game analytics on how playtime
can be analyzed using survival analysis without covariates. Survival and hazard
estimates provide both a visual and an analytic interpretation of the playtime
phenomena as a funnel type nonparametric estimate. Metrics based on the
survival curve can be used to aggregate this playtime information into a single
statistic. Comparison of survival curves between cohorts provides a scientific
AB-test. All these methods work on censored data and enable computation of
confidence intervals. This is especially important in time and sample limited
data which occurs during game development. Throughout this paper, we illustrate
the application of these methods to real world game development problems on the
Hipster Sheep mobile game.

spin measurements in terms of a probability density distribution resulting from
a rapidly changing angular momentum during an extended Zitterbewegung, a
light-like model of electron and Fermions is formulated. This model describes
individual particles in terms of paths of a moving quantum. It is shown that
this description allows one to reproduce observable properties as path-averages
over a period of the fast extended Zitterbewegung in elementary calculations.
The general topology of the paths may be described as a helical path, with a
helix axis forming a circle around a fixed point in space. The radius of the
helix and of the circle are equal and given by half the reduced Compton wave
length of a photon of energy equal to the rest energy of the particle
described. The paths depend on the relative velocity between the described
entity and the observer, and represent the De Broglie wave. The merits of the
proposed model are summarized and its role in relation to the established
description by quantum mechanics discussed. It is concluded that it supports
the existence of the proposed extended Zitterbewegung, and offers a description
of quantum behaviour without quantum mechanics.
