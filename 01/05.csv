computed with additional tests in the light of the suggestions provided in
recent publications.
  The analysis is extended to different metallicities, by comparing GCE results
and updated spectroscopic observations of unevolved field stars. We verify that
the GCE predictions obtained with different tests may represent, on average,
the evolution of selected neutron-capture elements in the Galaxy. The impact of
an additional weak s-process contribution from fast-rotating massive stars is

cluster perturbation theory (CPT), we construct a generalization of the
approach such that macroscopic conservation laws are respected. This is
achieved by exploiting the freedom for the choice of the starting point of the
all-order perturbation theory in the inter-cluster hopping. The proposed
conserving CPT is a self-consistent propagation scheme which respects the
conservation of energy, particle number and spin, which treats short-range
correlations exactly up to the linear scale of the cluster, and which
represents a mean-field-like approach on length scales beyond the cluster size.
Using Green's functions, conservation laws are formulated as local continuity
equations for the local spin-dependent particle and the doublon density. We
consider them as conditional equations to self-consistently fix the
time-dependent intra-cluster one-particle parameters. Thanks to the intrinsic
causality of the CPT, this can be set up as a step-by-step time propagation
scheme with a computational effort scaling linearly with the maximum
propagation time and exponentially in the cluster size. As a proof of concept,
we consider the dynamics of the two-dimensional, particle-hole-symmetric
Hubbard model following a weak interaction quench by simply employing two-site
clusters only. Conservation laws are satisfied by construction. We demonstrate
that enforcing them has strong impact on the dynamics. While the doublon
density is strongly oscillating within plain CPT, a monotonic relaxation is
observed within the conserving CPT.

software attacks, compromising security of applications as well. To overcome
this dependency, Intel introduced SGX, which allows to protect application code
against a subverted or malicious OS by running it in a hardware-protected
enclave. However, SGX lacks support for generic trusted I/O paths to protect
user input and output between enclaves and I/O devices.
  This work presents SGXIO, a generic trusted path architecture for SGX,
allowing user applications to run securely on top of an untrusted OS, while at
the same time supporting trusted paths to generic I/O devices. To achieve this,
SGXIO combines the benefits of SGX's easy programming model with traditional
hypervisor-based trusted path architectures. Moreover, SGXIO can tweak insecure
debug enclaves to behave like secure production enclaves. SGXIO surpasses
traditional use cases in cloud computing and makes SGX technology usable for
protecting user-centric, local applications against kernel-level keyloggers and
likewise. It is compatible to unmodified operating systems and works on a
modern commodity notebook out of the box. Hence, SGXIO is particularly
promising for the broad x86 community to which SGX is readily available.

  We show that allowing for slight overlaps, $n$ qubits can fit in just

Meanwhile, magnetic manifestations have posed and still do pose complex and

may be foremost caused by the fact that all of these effects are based on
correlated structures, which are induced by the interplay of dynamics and
elementary interactions. It is strongly correlated systems that certainly
represent one of the most fascinating and universal fields of research. In

intriguing and complex problems of modern solid state physics. Even after two

line. Recently, Miller et al. (2103) have presented broad-band, high quality
NuSTAR data of SerX-1.Using relativistically smeared self-consistent reflection
models, they find a value of R_in close to 1.0 R_ISCO (corresponding to 6 R_g),
and a low inclination angle, less than 10 deg. Aims: The aim of this paper is
to probe to what extent the choice of reflection and continuum models (and
uncertainties therein) can affect the conclusions about the disk parameters
inferred from the reflection component. To this aim we re-analyze all the
available public NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. Ser X-1 is a well studied source, its
spectrum has been observed by several instruments, and is therefore one of the
best sources for this study. Methods: We use slightly different continuum and
reflection models with respect to those adopted in literature for this source.
In particular we fit the iron line and other reflection features with
self-consistent reflection models as reflionx (with a power-law illuminating
continuum modified with a high energy cutoff to mimic the shape of the incident
Comptonization spectrum) and rfxconv. With these models we fit NuSTAR and
XMM-Newton spectra yielding consistent spectral results. Results: Our results
are in line with those already found by Miller et al. (2013) but less extreme.
In particular, we find the inner disk radius at about 13 R_g and an inclination
angle with respect to the line of sight of about 27 deg. We conclude that,
while the choice of the reflection model has little impact on the disk
parameters, as soon as a self-consistent model is used, the choice of the
continuum model can be important in the precise determination of the disk
parameters from the reflection component. Hence broad-band X-ray spectra are
highly preferable to constrain the continuum and disk parameters.

Let $\nu$ be the restriction of $\nu^*$ to $K$. The associated graded ring
${\rm gr}_{\nu}(R)$ was introduced by Bernard Teissier. It plays an important
role in local uniformization. We show that the extension $(K,\nu)\rightarrow

statement is not true when $\nu$ does not satisfy these assumptions. We deduce
that if $\nu$ has rational rank 1 and is not discrete and if $R\rightarrow R'$

size of the so-called big data, thus requiring refined investigative tools for
appropriate statistical analyses and data mining. We present a new approach
based on the complex network theory, offering a powerful framework to explore
complex systems with a huge number of interacting elements. Although interest
on complex networks has been increasing in the last years, few recent studies
have been applied to turbulence. We propose an investigation starting from a
two-point correlation for the kinetic energy of a forced isotropic field
numerically solved. Among all the metrics analyzed, the degree centrality is
the most significant, suggesting the formation of spatial patterns which
coherently move with similar vorticity over the large eddy turnover time scale.
Pattern size can be quantified through a newly-introduced parameter (i.e.,
average physical distance) and varies from small to intermediate scales. The
network analysis allows a systematic identification of different spatial
regions, providing new insights into the spatial characterization of turbulent
flows. Based on present findings, the application to highly inhomogeneous flows
seems promising and deserves additional future investigation.

impossible for an adversary to produce the hash $f(x)$ without knowing the
secret message $x\in\{0, 1\}^n$. Unfortunately, all hash functions are
vulnerable under the side-channel attack, which is a grave concern for
information security in practice. This is because typically $m\ll n$ and an
adversary needs only $m$ bits of information to pass the verification test.
  In sharp contrast, we show that when quantum states are used, the leakage
allowed can be almost the entire secret. More precisely, we call a function
that maps $n$ bits to $m$ qubits a quantum cryptographic function if the
maximum fidelity between two distinct hashes is negligible in $n$. We show that
for any $k=n-\omega(\log n)$, all quantum cryptographic hash functions remain
cryptographically secure when leaking $k$ bits of information. By the quantum
fingerprinting constructions of Buhrman et al.~({\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} 87,

hash functions. We also show that one only needs $\omega(\log^2 n)$ qubits to
verify a quantum cryptographic hash, rather than the whole classical
information needed to generate one.
  Our result also shows that to approximately produce a small amount of quantum
side information on a classical secret, it may require almost the full
information of the secret. This large gap represents a significant barrier for
proving quantum security of classical-proof extractors.

in machine learning has been to develop techniques that perform well in an
incremental (streaming) setting. In this paper, we investigate the problem of
private machine learning, where as common in practice, the data is not given at
once, but rather arrives incrementally over time.
  We introduce the problems of private incremental ERM and private incremental
regression where the general goal is to always maintain a good empirical risk
minimizer for the history observed under differential privacy. Our first
contribution is a generic transformation of private batch ERM mechanisms into
private incremental ERM mechanisms, based on a simple idea of invoking the
private batch ERM procedure at some regular time intervals. We take this
construction as a baseline for comparison. We then provide two mechanisms for
the private incremental regression problem. Our first mechanism is based on
privately constructing a noisy incremental gradient function, which is then
used in a modified projected gradient procedure at every timestep. This
mechanism has an excess empirical risk of $\approx\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the
dimensionality of the data. While from the results of [Bassily et al. 2014]
this bound is tight in the worst-case, we show that certain geometric
properties of the input and constraint set can be used to derive significantly
better results for certain interesting regression problems.

cases it may be inherent, e.g., the records in different geographical databases

reliability and humans' regularity in crowdsourced affective studies.
Reliability measures how likely a subject will respond to a question seriously;
and regularity measures how often a human will agree with other
seriously-entered responses coming from a targeted population.
Crowdsourcing-based studies or experiments, which rely on human self-reported
affect, pose additional challenges as compared with typical crowdsourcing
studies that attempt to acquire concrete non-affective labels of objects. The
reliability of participants has been massively pursued for typical
non-affective crowdsourcing studies, whereas the regularity of humans in an
affective experiment in its own right has not been thoroughly considered. It
has been often observed that different individuals exhibit different feelings
on the same test question, which does not have a sole correct response in the
first place. High reliability of responses from one individual thus cannot
conclusively result in high consensus across individuals. Instead, globally
testing consensus of a population is of interest to investigators. Built upon
the agreement multigraph among tasks and workers, our probabilistic model
differentiates subject regularity from population reliability. We demonstrate
the method's effectiveness for in-depth robust analysis of large-scale
crowdsourced affective data, including emotion and aesthetic assessments
collected by presenting visual stimuli to human subjects.

  Distribution-Guided Scores for Ranks","28 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is motivated by a hand-collected data set from one of the largest
Internet portals in Korea. This data set records the top 30 most frequently
discussed stocks on its on-line message board. The frequencies are considered
to measure the attention paid by investors to individual stocks. The empirical
goal of the data analysis is to investigate the effect of this attention on
trading behavior. For this purpose, we regress the (next day) returns and the
(partially) observed ranks of frequencies. In the regression, the ranks are
transformed into scores, for which purpose the identity or linear scores are
commonly used. In this paper, we propose a new class of scores (a score
function) that is based on the moments of order statistics of a pre-decided
random variable. The new score function, denoted by D-rank, is shown to be
asymptotically optimal to maximize the correlation between the response and
score, when the pre-decided random variable and true covariate are in the same
location-scale family. In addition, the least-squares estimator using the
D-rank consistently estimates the true correlation between the response and the
covariate, and asymptotically approaches the normal distribution. We
additionally propose a procedure for diagnosing a given score function
(equivalently, the pre-decided random variable Z) and selecting one that is
better suited to the data. We numerically demonstrate the advantage of using a
correctly specified score function over that of the identity scores (or other
misspecified scores) in estimating the correlation coefficient. Finally, we
apply our proposal to test the effects of investors' attention on their returns
using the motivating data set.

with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an
extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger
than any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs
have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute
localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host
galaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the
presence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted
in an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here
we report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known
repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric
observations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise
localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180
uJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with
non-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The
flux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day
timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size
less than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst
having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent
star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of
extragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly
faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct
sub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable
associations.

represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond
localization (~ 100mas precision) of FRB121102 using the VLA has led to its
unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to
the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise
localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship
between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent
emission. Here we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations
using the European VLBI Network and the 305-m Arecibo telescope, which
simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at
milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a
projected linear separation of < 40pc (< 12mas angular separation, at 95%
confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and
persistent radio source (~ 2-4mas at 1.7GHz), which are both similar to the
expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a
projected size constrained to be < 0.7pc (< 0.2mas angular extent at 5.0GHz)
and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of T_b > 5 x 10^7K. Together,
these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between
FRB121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source
associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron
star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB121102 that
best match the observed data.

provided the first unambiguous association (chance coincidence probability
$p\lesssim3\times10^{-4}$) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio
counterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart
and find that it is an extended ($0.6^{\prime\prime}-0.8^{\prime\prime}$)
object displaying prominent Balmer and [OIII] emission lines. Based on the
spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a
low-metallicity, star-forming, $m_{r^\prime} = 25.1$ AB mag dwarf galaxy at a
redshift of $z=0.19273(8)$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc.
From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host
galaxy to have a diameter $\lesssim4$ kpc and a stellar mass of
$M_*\sim4-7\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to
3$\,M_\odot\,L_\odot^{-1}$. Based on the H$\alpha$ flux, we estimate the star
formation rate of the host to be $0.4\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and a
substantial host dispersion measure depth $\lesssim 324\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$.
The net dispersion measure contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is
likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show
that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102's location reported by Marcote
et al (2017) is offset from the galaxy's center of light by $\sim$200 mas and
the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB
121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric
localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities
and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long
gamma ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.

bluer than those of cluster early-type galaxies. When compact groups have both
early- and late-type member galaxies, the MIR colors of the late-type members
in those compact groups are bluer than the MIR colors of cluster late-type
galaxies. As compact groups are located in denser regions, they tend to have
larger early-type galaxy fractions and bluer MIR color galaxies. These trends
are also seen for neighboring galaxies around compact groups. However, compact

been largely addressed in the quantum optics literature under the rotating wave
approximation (RWA), where rapid oscillating terms in the qubit-mode
interaction picture Hamiltonian can be neglected. At the same time, it is
generally accepted that provided the interaction is sufficiently strong or for
long times, the RWA tends to describe physical phenomena incorrectly. In this
work, we extend the investigation of the validity of the RWA to a more involved
setup where two qubit-mode subsystems are brought to interaction through their
harmonic coordinates. Our treatment is all analytic thanks to a sequence of
carefully chosen unitary transformations which allows us to diagonlize the
Hamiltonian within and without the RWA. By also considering qubit dephasing, we
find that the purity of the two-qubit state presents non-Markovian features
which become more pronounced as the coupling between the modes gets stronger
and the RWA loses its validity. In the same regime, there occurs fast
generation of entanglement between the qubits which is also not correctly
described under the RWA. The setup and results presented here clearly show the
limitations of the RWA in a scenario amenable to exact description and free
from numerical uncertainties. Consequently, it may be of interest for the
community working with cavity or circuit quantum electrodynamic systems in the

spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, uncovering new
insights into its atmosphere at the day-night terminator. We extensively
explore the parameter space with an unprecedented 10$^8$ models, spanning the
continuum from fully cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian
retrieval framework. We report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry
(NH$_3$ and/or HCN) in an exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7-7.7$\sigma$ confidence,
non-uniform cloud coverage at 4.5-5.4$\sigma$, high-altitude hazes at
$>$3$\sigma$, and sub-solar H$_2$O at $\gtrsim$3-5$\sigma$, depending on the
assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH$_3$ at 3.3$\sigma$ and 4.9$\sigma$ for
fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model with the
highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H$_2$O at 5-15 ppm (0.01-0.03$\times$
solar) and NH$_3$ at 0.01-2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting disequilibrium chemistry
and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions. Our results herald new promise

are expected to form at the highest peaks of the density field, which
constitute the cores of massive proto-clusters. Luminous quasars (QSOs) at z~4
are the most strongly clustered population known, and should thus reside in
massive dark matter halos surrounded by large overdensities of galaxies,
implying a strong QSO-galaxy cross-correlation function. We observed six z~4
QSO fields with VLT/FORS exploiting a novel set of narrow band filters custom
designed to select Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in a thin redshift slice of
Delta_z~0.3, mitigating the projection effects that have limited the
sensitivity of previous searches for galaxies around z>~4 QSOs. We find that
LBGs are strongly clustered around QSOs, and present the first measurement of
the QSO-LBG cross-correlation function at z~4, on scales of 0.1<~R<~9 Mpc/h
(comoving). Assuming a power law form for the cross-correlation function
xi=(r/r0_QG)^gamma, we measure r0_QG=8.83^{+1.39}_{-1.51} Mpc/h for a fixed
slope of gamma=2.0. This result is in agreement with the expected
cross-correlation length deduced from measurements of the QSO and LBG
auto-correlation function, and assuming a linear bias model. We also measure a
strong auto-correlation of LBGs in our QSO fields finding
r0_GG=21.59^{+1.72}_{-1.69} Mpc/h for a fixed slope of gamma=1.5, which is ~4
times larger than the LBG auto-correlation length in random fields, providing
further evidence that QSOs reside in overdensities of LBGs. Our results
qualitatively support a picture where luminous QSOs inhabit exceptionally
massive (M_halo>10^12 M_sun) dark matter halos at z~4.

which dust overcomes both barriers. Its key ingredients are i) backreaction
from the dust onto the gas, ii) grain growth and fragmentation, and iii)
large-scale gradients. The pile-up of growing and fragmenting grains modifies
the gas structure on large scales and triggers the formation of pressure
maxima, in which particles are trapped. We show that these self-induced dust

fragmentation thresholds and initial dust-to-gas ratios. They are favored
locations for pebbles to grow into planetesimals, thus opening new paths

intriguing result in classical general relativity is the vanishing of the TLNs

nature of compact objects: (i) we compute the TLNs of exotic compact objects,
including different families of boson stars, gravastars, wormholes, and other
toy models for quantum corrections at the horizon scale. In the black-hole

(iii) We assess the ability of present and future gravitational-wave detectors
to measure the TLNs of these objects, including the first analysis of TLNs with
LISA. Both LIGO, ET and LISA can impose interesting constraints on boson stars,
while LISA is able to probe even extremely compact objects. We argue that the
TLNs provide a smoking gun of new physics at the horizon scale, and that future

modeling the ejecta-condensed dust in Cas A, which exhibits the same spectral

we find that it would be the dominant constituent of the dust in G54.1+0.3,
with possible secondary contributions from other compositions, such as carbon,
silicate, or alumina grains. The smallest mass of SN-formed dust required by

confirms the scenario in which the SN-formed dust has not yet been processed by
the SN reverse shock and is being heated by stars belonging to a cluster in

the tetrahedral $T_d$ point group symmetry of pristine diamond is maintained
when a vacancy defect is present. This is shown to arise from the presence of a
dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion that is stabilised by large vibrational
anharmonicity. Our calculations further demonstrate that the dynamic
Jahn-Teller-distorted structure of $T_d$ symmetry is lower in energy than the
static Jahn-Teller distorted tetragonal $D_{2d}$ vacancy defect, in agreement
with experimental observations. The tetrahedral vacancy structure becomes more
stable with respect to the tetragonal structure by increasing temperature. The
large anharmonicity arises mainly from quartic vibrations, and is associated
with a saddle point of the Born-Oppenheimer surface and a minimum in the free
energy. This study demonstrates that the behaviour of Jahn-Teller distortions
of point defects can be calculated accurately using anharmonic vibrational
methods. Our work will open the way for first-principles treatments of dynamic

The minimal SAdS Thermodynamics is extended within a Hamiltonian approach, by

that the cosmological constant can be introduced in the thermodynamic

it is compatible with the introduction of new thermodynamic potentials, and
respects the laws of black hole Thermodynamics. By demanding homogeneity of the

recent observational studies, that the <SFR>--BHAR relation for an AGN selected
sample produces a relatively flat trend, whilst the <BHAR>--SFR relation for a
SFR selected sample yields an approximately linear trend. These trends remain
consistent with their instantaneous equivalents even when both SFR and BHAR are
time-averaged over a period of 100~Myr. There is no universal relationship
between the two growth rates. Instead, SFR and BHAR evolve through distinct
paths that depend strongly on the mass of the host dark matter halo. The
galaxies hosted by haloes of mass M200 $\lesssim 10^{11.5}$Msol grow steadily,
yet black holes (BHs) in these systems hardly grow, yielding a lack of
correlation between SFR and BHAR. As haloes grow through the mass range
$10^{11.5} \lesssim$ M200 $\lesssim 10^{12.5 }$Msol BHs undergo a rapid phase
of non-linear growth. These systems yield a highly non-linear correlation
between the SFR and BHAR, which are non-causally connected via the mass of the
host halo. In massive haloes (M200 $\gtrsim 10^{12.5}$Msol) both SFR and BHAR
decline on average with a roughly constant scaling of SFR/BHAR $\sim 10^{3}$.
Given the complexity of the full SFR--BHAR plane built from multiple
behaviours, and from the large dynamic range of BHARs, we find the primary
driver of the different observed trends in the <SFR>--BHAR and <BHAR>--SFR
relationships are due to sampling considerably different regions of this plane.

we study the colliding wind binary gamma2 Velorum and aim at identifying the

multi-epoch VLTI/AMBER data that allows us to separate the spectral components

confirm previous distance measurements. We then analyse the spectra of the
individual stars, showing that the O star spectrum is peculiar within its
class. Then, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the
system from which we extract model images, visibility curves and closure phases
which can be directly compared with the observed data. The hydrodynamic
simulations reveal the 3D spiral structure of the wind collision region, which
results in phase-dependent emission maps. Our model visibility curves and
closure phases provide a good match when the wind collision region accounts for
3 to 10 per cent of the total flux in the near infrared. The dialogue between

and device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also
resulted in a growing number of reports on nearly ubiquitous presence of
ferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and
electromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in
the bulk, or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress
ferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be
suggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective
of the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of
PFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM
imaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric like
responses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible
mechanisms behind observed behaviors, and possible experimental strategies for
their identification.

produce the $z=0$ elliptical galaxy population are commonly ascribed to a
sudden quenching event, which is able to rid the central galaxy of its cold gas
reservoir in a short time. Following this event, the galaxy is able to prevent
further SF and stay quiescent via a maintenance mode. We test whether such a
quenching event is truly necessary using a simple model of quiescence. In this
model, hot gas (all gas above a temperature threshold) in a $\sim10^{12}
M_{\odot}$ halo mass galaxy at redshift $z\sim3$ is prevented from cooling. The
cool gas continues to form stars at a decreasing rate and the galaxy stellar
mass, morphology, velocity dispersion and position on the color magnitude
diagram (CMD) proceed to evolve. By $z=0$, the halo mass has grown to $10^{13}
M_{\odot}$ and the galaxy has attained characteristics typical of an observed
$z=0$ elliptical galaxy. Our model is run in the framework of a cosmological,
smooth particle hydrodynamic code which includes SF, early stellar feedback,
supernova feedback, metal cooling and metal diffusion. Additionally, we
post-process our simulations with a radiative transfer code to create a mock
CMD. In contrast to previous assumptions that a pure ""fade away"" model evolves
too slowly to account for the sparsity of galaxies in the ""green valley"", we
demonstrate crossing times of $<$1 Gyr. We conclude that no sudden quenching

presence of a modified time reversal symmetry that satisfies ${\cal T}^2=1 $.
Such chains can be realized in one dimensional structures embedded in
fractionalized two dimensional states of matter, e.g. at the edges of a
fractional quantum spin Hall system, where counter propagating modes may be
gapped either by back-scattering or by coupling to a superconductor. In the
absence of any additional symmetries, a chain of $\mathbb{Z}_m$ parafermions
can belong to one of several distinct phases. We find that when the modified
time reversal symmetry is imposed, the classification becomes richer. If $m $
is odd, each of the phases splits into two subclasses. We identify the symmetry
protected phase as a Haldane phase that carries a Kramers doublet at each end.
When $m $ is even, each phase splits into four subclasses. The origin of this
split is in the emergent Majorana fermions associated with even values of $m$.
We demonstrate the appearance of such emergent Majorana zero modes in a system
where the constituents particles are either fermions or bosons.

strong first order phase transition, that reheats the Standard Model (SM)

larger effective number of neutrinos compared to the SM value $N_{\text{eff}}
\approx 3$, as inferred from precision measurements of the cosmic microwave

anomalies. Hence, aspects of our scenario could be testable in terrestrial

how to learn causal relationships between variables from the kinds of
collections faced by modern data scientists: the number of experiments is
large, many experiments have very small effects, and the analyst lacks metadata
(e.g., descriptions of the interventions). Here we use experimental groups as
instrumental variables (IV) and show that a standard method (two-stage least
squares) is biased even when the number of experiments is infinite. We show how
a sparsity-inducing l0 regularization can --- in a reversal of the standard
bias--variance tradeoff in regularization --- reduce bias (and thus error) of
interventional predictions. Because we are interested in interventional loss
minimization we also propose a modified cross-validation procedure (IVCV) to
feasibly select the regularization parameter. We show, using a trick from Monte

techniques have been neglected by the solar community due to their failure to
reproduce solar observations. Nevertheless, some of these techniques are still
used to simulate the coronae and winds of solar analogs. Here we present a
comparative study between two MHD models for the solar corona and solar wind.
The first type of model is a polytropic wind model, and the second is the
physics-based AWSOM model. We show that while the AWSOM model consistently
reproduces many solar observations, the polytropic model fails to reproduce
many of these observations and in the cases it does, its solutions are
unphysical. Our recommendation is that polytropic models, which are used to
estimate mass-loss rates and other parameters of solar analogs, must be first
calibrated with solar observations. Alternatively, these models can be
calibrated with models that capture more detailed physics of the solar corona
(such as the AWSOM model), and that can reproduce solar observations in a
consistent manner. Without such a calibration, the results of the polytropic

represent the units of the network and edges represent connections between

between neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a
disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges
between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different
networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network
integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity
structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a
myriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse
club--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network.
The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties
consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly
interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global
integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that
produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating
that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.
Given the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the
macaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air

[3.6]-[4.5] colors between 0.3 mag and 1.6 mag. The photometric evolution of
SPRITEs is diverse, ranging from < 0.1 mag/yr to > 7 mag/yr. SPRITEs occur in
star-forming galaxies. We present an in-depth study of one of them, SPIRITS
14ajc in Messier 83, which shows shock-excited molecular hydrogen emission.
This shock may have been triggered by the dynamic decay of a non-hierarchical
system of massive stars that led to either the formation of a binary or a
proto-stellar merger.

issues related to stability and state transitions in low-mass X-ray binaries.
However, it is unclear how real discs become strongly magnetized and, even if
they do, whether they can remain in such a state. In this paper, we address the
latter issue through a pair of global disc simulations. Here, we only consider
cases of initially purely toroidal magnetic fields contained entirely within a
compact torus. We find that, over only a few tens of orbital periods, the
magnetization of an initially strongly magnetized disc,
$P_\mathrm{mag}/P_\mathrm{gas} \ge 10$, drops to $\lesssim 0.1$, similar to the
steady-state value reached in initially weakly magnetized discs. This is
consistent with recent shearing box simulations with initially strong toroidal
fields, the robust conclusion being that strongly magnetized toroidal fields
can not be locally self-sustaining. These results appear to leave net poloidal
flux or extended radial fields as the only avenues for establishing strongly
magnetized discs, ruling out the thermal collapse scenario.

in terms of commutative variables, we introduce variables transformations that
depend on a noncommutative parameter ($\gamma$). The main motivation for the
introduction of the noncommutativity is trying to explain the present
accelerated expansion of the universe. We obtain the dynamical equations for
these models and solve them. The solutions have four constants: $\gamma$, a
parameter associated with the fluid energy $C$, $k$, $\alpha$ and the initial

different equations of motion. Then, we compare the evolution of the universe
between the present noncommutative models and the corresponding commutative

describing an accelerating universe. We estimate the value of $\gamma$, for the

$E_{\mathrm{mag}}$, which confirms energy closure within the measurement
uncertainties and corroborates the magnetic origin of flares and CMEs; (2) The
energy partition of the dissipated magnetic free energy is: $0.51\pm0.17$ in
nonthermal energy of $\ge 6$ keV electrons, $0.17\pm0.17$ in nonthermal $\ge 1$

white-light flares is comparable with the thermal energy in soft X-rays (SXR);
(5) Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events carry a fraction $\approx 0.03$ of

The warm-target model predicts a lower limit of the low-energy cutoff at $e_c

develop a model of the occurrence-size distribution function of coronal loop
widths, characterized by a lower limit of widths $w_{min}$, a peak width $w_p$,
a peak occurrence number $n_p$, and a power law slope $a$. Our data analysis
includes automated tracing of curvi-linear features with the OCCULT-2 code,
automated sampling of the cross-sectional widths of coronal loops, and fitting
of the theoretical size distribution to the observed distribution. With
Monte-Carlo simulations and variable pixel sizes $\Delta x$ we derive a first
diagnostic criterion to discriminate whether the loop widths are unresolved
$(w_p/\Delta x \approx 2.5\pm0.2)$, or fully resolved (if $w_p/\Delta x >
2.7$). For images with resolved loop widths we can apply a second diagnostic
criterion that predicts the lower limit of loop widths, $w_{min} \approx 3
(\Delta x_{crit}-0.37"")$ as a function of the critical resolution $\Delta
x_{crit}$. We find that the loop widths are marginally resolved in AIA images,
but are fully resolved in Hi-C images, where our model predicts a lower limit
of loop widths at $w_{min} \approx 100$ km and a most frequent (peak) value at
$w_p \approx 300$ km, in agreement with recent results of Brooks et al. This
result agrees with the statistics of photospheric granulation sizes and thus
supports coronal heating mechanisms operating on the macroscopic scale of
photospheric magneto-convection, rather than nanoflare heating models with
unresolved microscopic scales.

amplitude of the critical current, but also the number of modes and their
transmission. We measured the CPR of many individual InAs nanowire Josephson
junctions, one junction at a time. Both the amplitude and shape of the CPR
varied between junctions, with small critical currents and skewed CPRs
indicating few-mode junctions with high transmissions. In a gate-tunable
junction, we found that the CPR varied with gate voltage: Near the onset of
supercurrent, we observed behavior consistent with resonant tunneling through a
single, highly transmitting mode. The gate dependence is consistent with
modeled subband structure that includes an effective tunneling barrier due to
an abrupt change in the Fermi level at the boundary of the gate-tuned region.
These measurements of skewed, tunable, few-mode CPRs are promising both for
applications that require anharmonic junctions and for Majorana readout

data into contiguous buckets or bins, where the function that categorizes an
element into a bucket is provided by the programmer. Due to the lack of an
efficient multisplit on GPUs, programmers often choose to implement multisplit
with a sort. One way is to first generate an auxiliary array of bucket IDs and
then sort input data based on it. In case smaller indexed buckets possess
smaller valued keys, another way for multisplit is to directly sort input data.
Both methods are inefficient and require more work than necessary: the former
requires more expensive data movements while the latter spends unnecessary
effort in sorting elements within each bucket. In this work, we provide a
parallel model and multiple implementations for the multisplit problem. Our
principal focus is multisplit for a small (up to 256) number of buckets. We use
warp-synchronous programming models and emphasize warp-wide communications to
avoid branch divergence and reduce memory usage. We also hierarchically reorder
input elements to achieve better coalescing of global memory accesses. On a
GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, we can reach a peak throughput of 18.93 Gkeys/s (or 11.68
Gpairs/s) for a key-only (or key-value) multisplit. Finally, we demonstrate how
multisplit can be used as a building block for radix sort. In our
multisplit-based sort implementation, we achieve comparable performance to the
fastest GPU sort routines, sorting 32-bit keys (and key-value pairs) with a
throughput of 3.0 G keys/s (and 2.1 Gpair/s).

non-orthogonal multiple access technology for the future fifth generation (5G)
communications. Due to the sparse nature, message passing algorithm (MPA) has
been used as the receiver to achieve close to maximum likelihood (ML) detection
performance with much lower complexity. However, the complexity order of MPA is
still exponential with the size of codebook and the degree of signal
superposition on a given resource element. In this paper, we propose a novel
low complexity iterative receiver based on expectation propagation algorithm
(EPA), which reduces the complexity order from exponential to linear.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EPA receiver achieves nearly
the same block error rate (BLER) performance as the conventional message
passing algorithm (MPA) receiver with orders less complexity.

challenges for quantum information processing. Current state-of-the-art
experiments rarely go beyond 10 qubits and in most cases demonstrate only
limited control. Here we demonstrate control of a 12-qubit system, and show
that the system can be employed as a quantum processor to optimize its own
control sequence by using measurement-based feedback control (MQFC). The final
product is a control sequence for a complex 12-qubit task: preparation of a
12-coherent state. The control sequence is about 10% more accurate than the one
generated by the standard (classical) technique, showing that MQFC can correct
for unknown imperfections. Apart from demonstrating a high level of control
over a relatively large system, our results show that even at the 12-qubit
level, a quantum processor can be a useful lab instrument. As an extension of
our work, we propose a method for combining the MQFC technique with a twirling
protocol, to optimize the control sequence that produces a desired Clifford

aspects of biological particles and both aspects can be combined by describing
the electron scattering intensity of the particle as a stochastic process with
a symmetric probability law and therefore symmetric moments. A maximum
likelihood estimator implemented by an expectation-maximization algorithm is
described which estimates the unknown statistics of the electron scattering
intensity stochastic process from images of instances of the particle. The
algorithm is demonstrated on the bacteriophage HK97 and the virus N$\omega$V.
The results are contrasted with existing algorithms which assume that each

approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems in data analysis and
scientific computing. These methods are based on augmenting the objective with
a penalty function, which is specified based on prior domain-specific expertise
to induce a desired structure in the solution. We consider the problem of
learning suitable regularization functions from data in settings in which
precise domain knowledge is not directly available. Previous work under the
title of `dictionary learning' or `sparse coding' may be viewed as learning a
regularization function that can be computed via linear programming. We
describe generalizations of these methods to learn regularizers that can be
computed and optimized via semidefinite programming. Our framework for learning
such semidefinite regularizers is based on obtaining structured factorizations
of data matrices, and our algorithmic approach for computing these
factorizations combines recent techniques for rank minimization problems along
with an operator analog of Sinkhorn scaling. Under suitable conditions on the
input data, our algorithm provides a locally linearly convergent method for
identifying the correct regularizer that promotes the type of structure
contained in the data. Our analysis is based on the stability properties of
Operator Sinkhorn scaling and their relation to geometric aspects of
determinantal varieties (in particular tangent spaces with respect to these
varieties). The regularizers obtained using our framework can be employed
effectively in semidefinite programming relaxations for solving inverse
problems.

lines that is separated from the open lines by current sheets, and different
branches of such sheets intersect at a critical line on the light cylinder
(LC). The LC is located far away from the neutron star, and the pulsar's
intrinsic magnetic field at that location is much weaker than the commonly
quoted numbers applicable to the star surface. The magnetic field surrounding
supermassive black holes that reside in galactic nuclei is of comparable or
greater strength. Therefore, when the pulsar travels inside such regions, a
non-negligible Lorentz force is experienced by the current sheets, which tends
to pull them apart at the critical line. As breakage occurs, instabilities
ensue that burst the bubble, allowing closed field lines to snap open and
release large amounts of electromagnetic energy, sufficient to power fast radio
bursts (FRBs). This process is necessarily associated with an environment of a
strong magnetic field and thus might explain the large rotation measures

Heisenberg Limit (HL), within a factor of $\sim$ $\sqrt{2}$, via collective
state detection and critical tuning of one-axis twist spin squeezing. It
generates a Schr\""odinger cat (SC) state, as a superposition of two extremal
collective states. When this SC interferometer is used as a gyroscope, the
interference occurs at an ultrahigh Compton frequency, corresponding to a
mesoscopic single object with a mass of $Nm$, where $N$ is the number of
particles in the ensemble, and $m$ is the mass of each particle. For $^{87}$Rb
atoms, with $N=10^{6}$, for example, the intereference would occur at a Compton
frequency of $\sim$ $2 \times 10^{31}$ Hz. Under this scheme, the signal is
found to depend critically on the parity of $N$. We present two variants of the
protocol. Under Protocol A, the fringes are narrowed by a factor of $N$ for one
parity, while for the other parity the signal is zero. Under Protocol B, the
fringes are narrowed by a factor of $N$ for one parity, and by a factor of
$\sqrt{N}$ for the other parity. Both protocols can be modified in a manner
that reverses the behavior of the signals for the two parities. Over repeated
measurements under which the probability of being even or odd is equal, the
averaged sensitivity is smaller than the HL by a factor of $\sim$ $\sqrt{2}$
for both versions of the protocol. We show that when the SC interferometer is
configured as an accelerometer, the effective two-photon wave vector is
enhanced by a factor of $N$, leading to the same degree of enhancement in
sensitivity. We also show that such a mesoscopic single object can be used to
increase the effective base frequency of an atomic clock by a factor of $N$,
with a sensitivity that is equivalent to the HL, within a factor of $\sim$
$\sqrt{2}$.

$m$ columns (dimensions), where $k$ and $m$ are proportional to $n$. For a
variety of important deterministic equiangular tight frames (ETFs) and tight
non-ETF frames, we consider the distribution of singular values of the
$k$-subset matrix. We observe that for large $n$ they can be precisely
described by a known probability distribution -- Wachter's MANOVA spectral
distribution, a phenomenon that was previously known only for two types of
random frames. In terms of convergence to this limit, the $k$-subset matrix
from all these frames is shown to be empirically indistinguishable from the
classical MANOVA (Jacobi) random matrix ensemble. Thus empirically the MANOVA
ensemble offers a universal description of the spectra of randomly selected
$k$-subframes, even those taken from deterministic frames. The same
universality phenomena is shown to hold for notable random frames as well. This
description enables exact calculations of properties of solutions for systems
of linear equations based on a random choice of $k$ frame vectors out of $n$
possible vectors, and has a variety of implications for erasure coding,
compressed sensing, and sparse recovery. When the aspect ratio $m/n$ is small,
the MANOVA spectrum tends to the well known Marcenko-Pastur distribution of the
singular values of a Gaussian matrix, in agreement with previous work on highly
redundant frames. Our results are empirical, but they are exhaustive, precise

(UAVs) serving a given region. Modeling this network as a uniform binomial
point process (BPP), we derive the downlink coverage probability of a reference
receiver located at an arbitrary position on the ground assuming Nakagami-$m$
fading for all wireless links. The reference receiver is assumed to connect to
its closest transmitting node as is usually the case in cellular systems. After
deriving the distribution of distances from the reference receiver to the
serving and interfering nodes, we derive an exact expression for downlink
coverage probability in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform of
interference power distribution. In the downlink of this system, it is not
unusual to encounter scenarios in which the line-of-sight (LOS) component is
significantly stronger than the reflected multipath components. To emulate such
scenarios, we also derive the coverage probability in the absence of fading
from the results of Nakagami-$m$ fading by taking the limit $m \to \infty$.
Using asymptotic expansion of incomplete gamma function, we concretely show
that this limit reduces to a redundant condition. Consequently, we derive an
accurate coverage probability approximation for this case using dominant
interferer-based approach in which the effect of dominant interferer is exactly
captured and the residual interference from other interferers is carefully
approximated. We then derive the bounds of the approximate coverage probability
using Berry-Esseen theorem. Our analyses reveal several useful trends in
coverage probability as a function of height of the transmitting nodes and the
location of reference receiver on the ground.

attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.
In this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by
superseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock
contests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's
contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that
this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited
for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b)
it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to
an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional,
fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to
compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our
mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds
on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players'
social welfare.

introduce Vizic, a Python visualization library that builds the connection
between images and catalogs through an interactive map of the sky region. Vizic
visualizes catalog data over a custom background canvas using the shape, size
and orientation of each object in the catalog. The displayed objects in the map
are highly interactive and customizable comparing to those in the images. These
objects can be filtered by or colored by their properties, such as redshift and
magnitude. They also can be sub-selected using a lasso-like tool for further
analysis using standard Python functions from inside a Jupyter notebook.
Furthermore, Vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of
the sky map. We have initially implemented several overlays, namely, Voronoi,
Delaunay, Minimum Spanning Tree and HEALPix grid layers, which are helpful for
visualizing large-scale structure. All these overlays can be generated, added
or removed interactively with one line of code. The catalog data is stored in a
non-relational database, and the interfaces were developed in JavaScript and
Python to work within Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create custom widgets,
user generated scripts to analyze and plot the data selected/displayed in the
interactive map. This unique design makes Vizic a very powerful and flexible
interactive analysis tool. Vizic can be adopted in variety of exercises, for
example, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies,
outlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations.

promoting individual cells to a state of higher persistence, which constitutes
an as-yet unreported contact enhancement of locomotion. Our findings suggest

which can combine perturbative and nonperturbative effects consistently for
theories like QCD. It is postulated that the strongly coupled nonperturbative
sector has a holographic dual in the form of a classical gravity theory in the
large N limit, and the perturbative fields determine the gravitational boundary
conditions. In this work, we pursue a fundamental derivation of this framework
particularly showing how perturbative physics by itself can determine the
holographic dual of the infrared, and also the interactions between the
perturbative and the holographic sectors. We firstly demonstrate that the
interactions between the two sectors can be constrained through the existence
of a conserved local energy-momentum tensor for the full system up to hard-soft
coupling constants. As an illustration, we set up a bi-holographic toy theory
where both the UV and IR sectors are strongly coupled and holographic with
distinct classical gravity duals. In this construction, the requirement that an
appropriate gluing can cure the singularities (geodetic incompletenesses) of
the respective geometries leads us to determine the parameters of the IR theory
and the hard-soft couplings in terms of those of the UV theory. The high energy
scale behaviour of the hard-soft couplings is state-independent but their
runnings turn out to be state-dependent. We discuss how our approach can be

from a finite set of candidates under unknown consumer preference. A standard
approach to this problem follows a two-step strategy: First, estimate the
preference of the consumer population, represented as a point in part-worth
space, using an adaptive discrete-choice questionnaire. Second, integrate the
estimated part-worth vector with engineering feasibility and cost models to
determine the optimal design. In this work, we (1) demonstrate that accurate
preference estimation is neither necessary nor sufficient for identifying the
optimal design, (2) introduce a novel adaptive questionnaire that leverages
knowledge about engineering feasibility and manufacturing costs to directly
determine the optimal design, and (3) interpret product design in terms of a
nonlinear segmentation of part-worth space, and use this interpretation to
illuminate the intrinsic difficulty of optimal design in the presence of noisy
questionnaire responses. We establish the superiority of the proposed approach
using a well-documented optimal product design task. This study demonstrates
how the identification of optimal product design can be accelerated by
integrating marketing and manufacturing knowledge into the adaptive

a single room. The payoff matrix in this model represents the complicated
interactions between selfish individuals, and the mean force imposed on an
individual is given by considering the impacts of neighborhood payoff, walls,
and defector herding. Each passer-by moves to his selected location according
to the Fermi function, and the average velocity of pedestrian flow is defined
as a function of the motion rule. Two pedestrian types are included:
cooperators, who adhere to the evacuation instructions; and defectors, who
ignore the rules and act individually. It is observed that the escape time
increases with the panic level, and the system remains smooth for a low panic
level, but exhibits three stages for a high panic level. We prove that the
panic level determines the dynamics of this system, and the initial density of
cooperators has a negligible impact. The system experiences three phases, a
single phase of cooperator, a mixed two-phase pedestrian, and a single phase of
defector sequentially as the panic level upgrades. The phase transition has
been proven basically robust to the changes of empty site contribution, wall's
pressure, and noise amplitude in the motion rule. It is further shown that
pedestrians derive the greatest benefit from overall cooperation, but are
trapped in the worst situation if they are all defectors.

""down"" magnetization, enabling magnetization switching. This magnetic switching
is found to be inhomogeneous throughout the material, with some individual FePt
nanoparticles neither switching nor demagnetizing. The origin of this behavior
is identified as the near-field modification of the incident laser radiation
around FePt nanoparticles. The fraction of not-switching nanoparticles is
influenced by the heat flow between FePt and a heat-sink layer.

need any knowledge on the product state and does not require the calculation of
any second derivatives. The underlying idea is to use two nearby points in
configuration space to locate the path of slowest ascent. By introducing a weak
noise term, the algorithm is able to find even low-lying saddle points that are
not reachable by means of a slowest ascent path. Since the algorithm makes only
use of the value of the potential and its gradient, the computational effort to
find saddles is linear in the number of degrees of freedom, if the potential is
short-ranged. We test the performance of the algorithm for two potential energy
landscapes. For the M\""uller-Brown surface we find that the algorithm always
finds the correct saddle point. For the modified M\""uller-Brown surface, which
has a saddle point that is not reachable by means of a slowest ascent path, the
algorithm is still able to find this saddle point with high probability.

offering orders of magnitude greater bandwidths combined with further gains via
beamforming and spatial multiplexing from multi-element antenna arrays. MmWave
system may exploit the hybrid analog and digital precoding to achieve
simultaneously the diversity, array and multiplexing gain with a lower cost of
implementation. Motivated by this, in this paper, we investigate the design of
hybrid precoder and combiner with sub-connected architecture, where each radio
frequency chain is connected to only a subset of base station (BS) antennas
from the perspective of energy efficient transmission. The problem of interest
is a non-convex and NP-hard problem that is difficult to solve directly. In
order to address it, we resort to design a two-layer optimization method to
solve the problem of interest by exploiting jointly the interference alignment
and fractional programming. First, the analog precoder and combiner are
optimized via the alternating-direction optimization method (ADOM) where the
phase shifter can be easily adjusted with an analytical structure. Then, we
optimize the digital precoder and combiner based on an effective multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) channel coefficient. The convergence of the proposed
algorithms is proved using the monotonic boundary theorem and fractional
programming theory. Extensive simulation results are given to validate the
effectiveness of the presented method and to evaluate the energy efficiency
performance under various system configurations.

except for very low pressures, the pressure dependence of both density and area
of micro-contacts remains well described by Greenwood-Williamson's model, which
neglects any interaction between asperities. In addition, in steady sliding,
friction measurements reveal that the mean shear stress at the scale of the
asperities is systematically larger than that found for a macroscopic contact
between a smooth lens and a rubber. This suggests that frictional stresses

generalization of Randers and Kropina metrics. They are constructed from the
natural data for Zermelo navigation problem, namely, a Riemannian metric $g_R$
and a vector field $W$ (the wind), where, now, the restriction of mild wind
$g_R(W,W)<1$ is dropped.
  Here, the models of WRS spaceforms of constant flag curvature are determined.
Indeed, the celebrated classification of Randers metrics of constant flag
curvature by Bao, Robles and Shen, extended to the Kropina case in the works by
Yoshikawa, Okubo and Sabau, can be used to obtain the local classification. For
the global one, a suitable result on completeness for WRS yields the complete
simply connected models. In particular, any of the local models in the Randers
classification does admit an extension to a unique model of wind Riemannian
structure, even if it cannot be extended as a complete Finslerian manifold.
  Thus, WRS's emerge as the natural framework for the analysis of Randers
spaceforms and, prospectively, wind Finslerian structures would become
important for other global problems too. For the sake of completeness, a brief
overview about WRS (including a useful link with the conformal geometry of a
class of relativistic spacetimes) is also provided.

The

Research activities focus on both and, thanks to them, we know not only many
measurable properties of networks but also the essence of some phenomena that
occur during the evolution of networks. One typical research area is the
analysis of co-authorship networks and their evolution. In our paper, the
analysis of one real-world co-authorship network and inspiration from existing
models form the basis of the hypothesis from which we derive new 3-lambda
network model. This hypothesis works with the assumption that regular behavior
of nodes revolves around an average. However, some anomalies may occur. The
3-lambda model is stochastic and uses the three parameters associated with the
average behavior of the nodes. The growth of the network based on this model
assumes that one step of the growth is an interaction in which both new and
existing nodes are participating. In the paper we present the results of the
analysis of a co-authorship network and formulate a hypothesis and a model
based on this hypothesis. Later in the paper, we examine the outputs from the
network generator based on the 3-lambda model and show that generated networks
have characteristics known from the environment of real-world networks.

categorize and search for content, and to spread short messages across members
of the social network. In this paper, we study temporal hashtag usage practices
in Twitter with the aim of designing a cognitive-inspired hashtag
recommendation algorithm we call BLLi,s. Our main idea is to incorporate the
effect of time on (i) individual hashtag reuse (i.e., reusing own hashtags),
and (ii) social hashtag reuse (i.e., reusing hashtags, which has been
previously used by a followee) into a predictive model. For this, we turn to
the Base-Level Learning (BLL) equation from the cognitive architecture ACT-R,
which accounts for the time-dependent decay of item exposure in human memory.
We validate BLLi,s using two crawled Twitter datasets in two evaluation
scenarios: firstly, only temporal usage patterns of past hashtag assignments
are utilized and secondly, these patterns are combined with a content-based
analysis of the current tweet. In both scenarios, we find not only that
temporal effects play an important role for both individual and social hashtag
reuse but also that BLLi,s provides significantly better prediction accuracy
and ranking results than current state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation
methods.

individual electron spins have been identified as versatile quantum information

circuit. Despite important experimental efforts to control the electron
displacement over long distances, keeping the electron spin coherence after
transfer remained up to now elusive. Here we demonstrate that individual
electron spins can be displaced coherently over a distance of 5 micrometers.
This displacement is realized on a closed path made of three tunnel-coupled
lateral quantum dots. Using fast quantum dot control, the electrons tunnel from
one dot to another at a speed approaching 100 m/s. We find that the spin
coherence length is 8 times longer than expected from the electron spin
coherence without displacement. Such an enhanced spin coherence points at a
process similar to motional narrowing observed in nuclear magnetic resonance
experiments6. The demonstrated coherent displacement will enable long-range
interaction between distant spin-qubits and will open the route towards
non-abelian and holonomic manipulation of a single electron spin.

We define a twisting cochain:\[\mathfrak{t} \colon LC_{\ast}(\Lambda) \to

dual. In particular, $\mathfrak{t}$ induces a quasi-isomorphism between
$CE^*(\Lambda)$ and the cobar of the Floer homology of $L$, $\Omega CF_*(L)$.
We use the duality result to show that under certain connectivity and locally
finiteness assumptions, $CE^*(\Lambda)$ is quasi-isomorphic to $C_{-*}(\Omega

distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP), a framework of modeling
MAS, to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets).
Two issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet
including: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the
negtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which
kind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the
quality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues, we firstly come up with
an ECAV-$\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\eta$
with an adequate assignment ($\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the
scale of the model. After that, a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed
on the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the
solution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the
Max-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method
(LDD), the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to
transform original problem into a satisfied one. In addition, it is also
apparent that the DCOP based method has better robustness than LDD when the

photosynthesis research and (bio)-molecular research in general. Oxygenic
photosystems typically display an asymmetric Cotton effect around the

signals are the direct result of the chirality of the supramolecular
aggregates. The circular polarization is thus directly influenced by the
composition and architecture of the photosynthetic macrodomains, and is thereby
linked to photosynthetic functioning. Although ordinarily measured only on a
molecular level, we have developed a new spectropolarimetric instrument,
TreePol, that allows for both laboratory and in-the-field measurements. Through
spectral multiplexing, TreePol is capable of fast measurements with a
sensitivity of $\sim 1*10^{-4}$ and is therefore suitable of non-destructively
probing the molecular architecture of whole plant leaves. We have measured the
chiroptical evolution of \textit{Hedera helix} leaves for a period of 22 days.
Spectrally resolved circular polarization measurements (450-900 nm) on whole
leaves in transmission exhibit a strong decrease in the polarization signal
over time after plucking, which we accredit to the deterioration of chiral
macro-aggregates. Chlorophyll \textit{a} levels measured over the same period
by means of UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a much
smaller decrease. With these results we are able to distinguish healthy from
deteriorating leaves. Hereby we indicate the potency of circular polarization
spectroscopy on whole and intact leaves as a nondestructive tool for structural
and plant stress assessment. Additionally, we underline the establishment of
circular polarization signals as remotely accessible means of detecting the

simulations of the geodynamo. We rely on a sequence of three convection-driven
simulations in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. The most extreme case
reaches towards the Earth's core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl
number Pm=0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number
Rm>500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E=1e-7), at the limit of what is
feasible on today's supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis
highlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo
theory predictions -- all present together in the same simulation -- but it
also unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth's core dynamics.In this
strong-field, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one
order of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of
magnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast
exists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the
cylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In
the interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and is associated with a
vigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the
formation of a reverse polar flux patch at the surface of the shell.
Furthermore, the strong magnetic field also allows accumulation of light
material within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratification there.
Torsional Alfv{\'e}n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the
tangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator.Outside the tangent
cylinder, the magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic
energy is mostly non-zonal. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the
low-frequency, non-zonal flow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly
large-scale: an m=1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations,
without any heterogeneous boundary forcing.Our spatio-temporal analysis further
reveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale flow is governed by a balance
between Coriolis and buoyancy forces -- magnetic field and flow tend to align,
minimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency flow obeys a balance
between magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live
at an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a 3-term 1 MAC balance --
involving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale (E^{1/3})
quasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic
intensity.

diagrammatic approach, we further factorize each topological amplitude into
decay constant, form factors and unknown universal parameters. By $\chi^2$
fitting 46 experimental observables, we extracted 10 theoretical parameters
with $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom around 2. Using the fitted parameters, we
calculated the branching fractions, polarization fractions, CP asymmetries and
relative phases between polarization amplitudes of each decay mode. The decay
channels dominated by tree diagram have large branching fractions and large
longitudinal polarization fraction. The branching fractions and longitudinal
polarization fractions of color-suppressed decays become smaller. Current
experimental data of large transverse polarization fractions in the penguin
dominant decay channels can be explained by only one transverse amplitude of
penguin annihilation diagram. Our predictions of those not yet measured
channels can be tested in the ongoing LHCb experiment and the Belle-II
experiment in future.

around solar-type stars. Improving our understanding of these mysterious
planets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for
detailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets
detected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.
Indeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they
regularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit
probability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of
possible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer
multi-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected
by radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by
the HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the
project. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly
disfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We
derive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets
transits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant
probability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our
Spitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted
planets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them. Our
light curves demonstrate for Warm Spitzer excellent photometric precisions: for
14 targets out of 19, we were able to reach standard deviations that were
better than 50ppm per 30 min intervals. Combined with its Earth-trailing orbit,
which makes it capable of pointing any star in the sky and to monitor it
continuously for days, this work confirms Spitzer as an optimal instrument to
detect sub-mmag-deep transits on the bright nearby stars targeted by Doppler
surveys.

the effective shear modulus of a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) is studied
theoretically in the framework of a recently introduced approach to the
single-particle magnetostriction mechanism [V. M. Kalita et al, Phys. Rev. E
93, 062503 (2016)]. The planar problem of magnetostriction in an MAE with soft
magnetic inclusions in the form of a thin disk (platelet) having the magnetic
anisotropy in the plane of this disk is solved analytically. An external
magnetic field acts with torques on magnetic filler particles, creates
mechanical stresses in the vicinity of inclusions, induces shear strain and
increases the effective shear modulus of these composite materials. It is shown
that the largest effect of the magnetic field on the effective shear modulus
should be expected in MAEs with soft elastomer matrices, where the shear
modulus of the matrix is less than the magnetic anisotropy constant of
inclusions. It is derived that the effective shear modulus is non-linearly
dependent on the external magnetic field and approaches the saturation value in
magnetic fields exceeding the field of particle anisotropy. It is shown that
model calculations of the effective shear modulus correspond to a
phenomenological definition of effective elastic moduli and magnetoelastic
coupling constants. Obtained theoretical results compare well with known
experimental data. Determination of effective elastic coefficients in MAEs and
their dependence on magnetic field is discussed. The concentration dependence
of the effective shear modulus at higher filler concentrations has been
estimated using the method of Pad\'e approximants, which correctly predicts
that both the absolute and relative changes of the magnetic-field dependent
effective shear modulus will significantly increase with the growing
concentration of filler particles.

can occur when the heating is both highly-stratified and quasi-constant.
Unambiguous observational identification of TNE would thus permit to strongly
constrain heating scenarios. Up to now, while TNE is the standard
interpretation of coronal rain, the long-term periodic evolution predicted by
simulations has never been observed yet. However, the detection of long-period
intensity pulsations (periods of several hours) has been recently reported with
SoHO/EIT, and this phenomenon appears to be very common in loops. Moreover, the
three intensity-pulsation events that we recently studied with SDO/AIA show
strong evidence for TNE in warm loops. In the present paper, a realistic loop
geometry from LFFF extrapolations is used as input to 1D hydrodynamic
simulations. Our simulations show that for the present loop geometry, the
heating has to be asymmetrical to produce TNE. We analyse in detail one
particular simulation that reproduces the average thermal behavior of one of
the pulsating loop bundle observed with AIA. We compare the properties of this
simulation with the properties deduced from the observations. The magnetic
topology of the LFFF extrapolations points to the presence of sites of
preferred reconnection at one footpoint, supporting the presence of asymmetric
heating. In addition, we can reproduce the temporal large-scale intensity
properties of the pulsating loops. This simulation further strengthens the
interpretation of the observed pulsations as signatures of TNE. This thus gives
important information on the heating localization and time scale for these
loops.

convergence field around clusters of galaxies to constrain their connectivity
to the cosmic web. We describe in this paper the corresponding theory in
Lagrangian space where analytical results can be obtained by identifying
clusters to peaks in the initial field. We derive the three-point Gaussian
statistics of a two-dimensional field and its first and second derivatives. The
formalism allows us to study the statistics of the field in a shell around a
central peak, in particular its multipolar decomposition. The peak condition is
shown to significantly remove power from the dipolar contribution and to modify
the monopole and quadrupole. As expected, higher order multipoles are not
significantly modified by the constraint. Analytical predictions are
successfully checked against measurements in Gaussian random fields. The effect
of substructures and radial weighting is shown to be small and does not change
the qualitative picture. The non-linear evolution is shown to induce a
non-linear bias of all multipoles proportional to the cluster mass.We predict
the Gaussian and weakly non-Gaussian statistics of multipolar moments of a
two-dimensional field around a peak as a proxy for the azimuthal distribution
of the convergence field around a cluster of galaxies. A quantitative estimate
of this multipolar decomposition of the convergence field around clusters in
numerical simulations of structure formation and in observations will be
presented in two forthcoming papers.

determines provably minimal graph bisection or outputs ""fail"" when the
optimality cannot be certified. In this paper we focus on Boppana's algorithm
which belongs to one of the most prominent methods of this type. It is well
known that the algorithm works well in the random \emph{planted bisection
model} -- the standard class of graphs for analysis minimum bisection and
relevant problems. In 2001 Feige and Kilian posed the question if Boppana's
algorithm works well in the semirandom model by Blum and Spencer. In our paper
we answer this question affirmatively. We show also that the algorithm achieves
similar performance on graph classes which extend the semirandom model.
  Since the behavior of Boppana's algorithm on the semirandom graphs remained
unknown, Feige and Kilian proposed a new semidefinite programming (SDP) based
approach and proved that it works on this model. The relationship between the
performance of the SDP based algorithm and Boppana's approach was left as an
open problem. In this paper we solve the problem in a complete way by proving
that the bisection algorithm of Feige and Kilian provides exactly the same
results as Boppana's algorithm. As a consequence we get that Boppana's
algorithm achieves the optimal threshold for exact cluster recovery in the
\emph{stochastic block model}. On the other hand we prove some limitations of
Boppana's approach: we show that if the density difference on the parameters of
the planted bisection model is too small then the algorithm fails with high
probability in the model.

on the parameter space of i) Dark Matter models based on keV sterile neutrinos;
ii) the ""fuzzy"" wavelike Dark Matter models, based on Bose-Einstein condensate
of ultra-light particles. For the case of the sterile neutrinos, we consider
two production mechanisms: resonant production through the mixing with active
neutrinos and the decay of scalar particles. For the former model, we derive
constraints for the combination of sterile neutrino mass $m_{\nu}$ and mixing
parameter $\sin^2(2\theta)$ which provide the tightest lower bounds on the
mixing angle (and hence on the lepton asymmetry) derived so far by methods
independent of baryonic physics. For the latter we compute the allowed
combinations of the scalar mass, its coupling to the Higgs field, and the
Yukawa coupling of the scalar to the sterile neutrinos. We compare our results
to independent, existing astrophysical bounds on sterile neutrinos in the same
mass range. For the case of ""fuzzy"" Dark Matter, we show that the observed
number density $\approx 1/{\rm Mpc}^3$ of high-redshift galaxies in the HFF
sets a lower limit $m_\psi\geq 8\cdot 10^{-22}$ eV (at 3-$\sigma$ confidence
level) on the particle mass, a result that strongly disfavors wavelike bosonic
Dark Matter as a viable model for structure formation. We discuss the impact on

change of the resonance frequency. We demonstrate that the device can be

= 31.3 K. Detailed analysis is undertaken on the data. Both the dynamical
relaxation and conventional relaxation have been measured leading to the
self-consistent determination of the magnetization relaxation rate. It is found
that the data are well described by the collective pinning model leading to the
glassy exponent of about $\mu\approx$ 1.64 to 1.68 with the magnetic fields of
1 and 3 T. The analysis based on Maley's method combining with the conventional
relaxation data allows us to determine the current dependent activation energy
$U$ which yields a $\mu$ value of about 1.23 to 1.29 for the magnetic fields of
1 and 3 T. The second magnetization peaks appear in wide temperature region
from 2 K to 24 K. The separation between the second peak field and the
irreversibility field becomes narrow when temperature is increased. When the
two fields are close to each other, we find that the second peak evolves into a
step like transition of magnetization, suggesting a crossover from the second
order to first order transition. Finally, we present a vortex phase diagram and
demonstrate that the vortex dynamics in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ can be used as a

hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) formation have on the Galactic distribution of
X-ray binaries (XRBs) which contain these objects. We find that the root mean
square of the height above the Galactic plane of BH- and NS-XRBs is a powerful
proxy to discriminate among different formation scenarios, and that binary
evolution following the BH/NS formation does not significantly affect the
Galactic distributions of the binaries. We find that a population model in
which at least some BHs receive a (relatively) high natal kick fits the
observed BH-XRBs best. For the NS case, we find that a high NK distribution,
consistent with the one derived from the measurement of pulsar proper motion,
is the most preferable. We also analyse the simple method we previously used to
estimate the minimal peculiar velocity of an individual BH-XRB at birth. We
find that this method may be less reliable in the bulge of the Galaxy for
certain models of the Galactic potential, but that our estimate is excellent
for most of the BH-XRBs.

S\'ersic index and $D_n4000$ for ~40,000 quiescent galaxies in the SDSS. At a
fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher $D_n4000$ have larger velocity
dispersions and smaller sizes. $D_n4000$ is a proxy for stellar population age,
thus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have larger velocity
dispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion and size into a
dynamical mass estimator, $\sigma^2 R$. At a fixed stellar mass, $\sigma^2 R$
depends on $D_n4000$. The S\'ersic index is also correlated with $D_n4000$. The
dependence of $\sigma^2 R$ and S\'ersic index on $D_n4000$ suggests that
quiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems. We derive an
empirical correction for non-homology which is consistent with the analytical
correction derived from the virial theorem. After accounting for non-homologous
galactic structure, we measure $M_\ast \propto M_d^{0.998 \pm 0.004}$ where
$M_\ast$ is the stellar mass and $M_d$ is the dynamical mass derived from the
velocity dispersion and size; stellar mass is directly proportional to
dynamical mass. Quiescent galaxies appear to be in approximate virial
equilibrium and deviations of the fundamental plane parameters from the
expected virial relation may result from mass-to-light ratio variations,
selection effects and the non-homology of quiescent galaxies. We infer the
redshift evolution of velocity dispersion and size for galaxies in our sample
assuming purely passive evolution. The inferred evolution is inconsistent with
direct measurements at higher redshifts. Thus quiescent galaxies do not
passively evolve. Quiescent galaxies have properties consistent with standard
galaxy formation in $\Lambda$CDM. They form at different epochs and evolve
modestly increasing their size, velocity dispersion and S\'ersic index after
they cease star formation.

particularly challenging due to the considerable spatial uncertainty on tracer
pathways and dominant controlling processes, such as dispersion, channeling,
trapping, matrix diffusion, ambient and density driven flows. We attempted to
reduce this uncertainty by coupling push-pull tracer experiments with
single-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) time-lapse imaging. The experiments
involved different injection fractures, chaser volumes and resting times, and
were performed at the fractured rock research site of Ploemeur in France (H+
network, hplus.ore.fr/en). For the GPR acquisitions, we used both fixed and
moving antenna setups in a borehole that was isolated with a flexible liner.
During the fixed-antenna experiment, time-varying GPR reflections allowed us to
track the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tracer during the push-pull
experiment. During the moving antenna experiments, we clearly imaged the
dominant fractures in which tracer transport took place, fractures in which the
tracer was trapped for longer time periods, and the spatial extent of the
tracer distribution (up to 8 m) at different times. This demonstrated the
existence of strongly channelized flow in the first few meters and radial flow
at greater distances. By varying the resting time of a given experiment, we
identified regions affected by density-driven and ambient flow. These
experiments open up new perspectives for coupled hydrogeophysical inversion

there are complex inter- and intra- modal dependencies. While several
approaches have been proposed for dependent data fusion (e.g., based on copula
theory), their advantages come at a high price in terms of computational
complexity. In this paper, we treat the detection problem with compressive
sensing (CS) where compression at each sensor is achieved via low dimensional
random projections. CS has recently been exploited to solve detection problems
under various assumptions on the signals of interest, however, its potential
for dependent data fusion has not been explored adequately. We exploit the
capability of CS to capture statistical properties of uncompressed data in
order to compute decision statistics for detection in the compressed domain.
First, a Gaussian approximation is employed to perform likelihood ratio (LR)
based detection with compressed data. In this approach, inter-modal dependence
is captured via a compressed version of the covariance matrix of the
concatenated (temporally and spatially) uncompressed data vector. We show that,
under certain conditions, this approach with a small number of compressed
measurements per node leads to enhanced performance compared to detection with
uncompressed data using widely considered suboptimal approaches. Second, we
develop a nonparametric approach where a decision statistic based on the second
order statistics of uncompressed data is computed in the compressed domain. The
second approach is promising over other related nonparametric approaches and
the first approach when multimodal data is highly correlated at the expense of
slightly increased computational complexity.

use analytical expressions for the Maxwell equations in a homogeneous space to

frequency-dependent dispersion and attenuation through the empirical Jonscher
formulation. We discretize fractures into elements that are linearly polarized
by the incoming electric field that arrives from the source to each element,
locally, as a plane wave. To model the effective source wavelet we use a
generalized Gamma distribution to define the antenna dipole moment. We combine
microscopic and macroscopic Maxwell's equations to derive an analytic
expression for the response of each element, which describes the full electric
dipole radiation patterns along with effective reflection coefficients of thin

inverting geophysical and hydrological data allows us to benefit from the
advantages of geophysical imaging and, at the same time, recover the
hydrological parameters of interest. We have applied a coupling strategy
between geophysical and hydrological models that is based on structural
similarity constraints. Model combinations, for which the spatial gradients of
the inferred parameter fields are not aligned in parallel, are penalized in the
inversion. This structural coupling does not require introducing a potentially
weak, unknown, and nonstationary petrophysical relation to link the models. The
method was first tested on synthetic data sets and then applied to two
combinations of geophysical/hydrological data sets from a saturated gravel
aquifer in northern Switzerland. Crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
traveltimes were jointly inverted with hydraulic tomography data, as well as
with tracer mean arrival times, to retrieve the 2D distribution of GPR

form factors from worldwide data with an emphasis on precise new data covering
the low-momentum region, which is sensitive to the large-scale structure of the
nucleon. From these, we construct the flavor-separated Dirac and Pauli form
factors and their ratios, and compare the results to recent extractions and
theoretical calculations and models.

their cross sectional areas along complex lines (special 2-dimensional real
planes) through the origin. Under mild symmetry conditions on one of the bodies
a Busemann-Petty type theorem holds. Quaternionic and Octonionic analogs also
hold. The argument relies on integration in polar coordinates coupled with
Jensen's inequality. Along the way we provide a criterion that detects which
centered bodies are {\it circular}. i.e., stabilized by multiplication by
complex numbers of unit modulus. Our goal is to present a Busemann-Petty type
result with a minimum of required background and, in addition, to suggest
characterizations of classes of star bodies by means of integral geometric
inequalities.

films grown on a different substrate. Residual strains of SiC have been widely
employed to form ultra-high frequency and high Q factor resonators. However, to
date the highest residual strain of SiC was reported to be limited to
approximately 0.6%. Large strains induced into SiC could lead to several
interesting physical phenomena, as well as significant improvement of resonant
frequencies. We report an unprecedented nano strain-amplifier structure with an
ultra-high residual strain up to 8% utilizing the natural residual stress
between epitaxial 3C SiC and Si. In addition, the applied strain can be tuned
by changing the dimensions of the amplifier structure. The possibility of
introducing such a controllable and ultra-high strain will open the door to
investigating the physics of SiC in large strain regimes, and the development

generic, flexible and concise code and to interact with the language using an
interactive Read-eval-print-loop (REPL). However, this flexibility has its
price: As the R interpreter has no information about the expected variable
type, many base functions automatically convert the input instead of raising an
exception. Unfortunately, this frequently leads to runtime errors deeper down
the call stack which obfuscates the original problem and renders debugging
challenging. Even worse, unwanted conversions can remain undetected and skew or
invalidate the results of a statistical analysis. As a resort, assertions can
be employed to detect unexpected input during runtime and to signal
understandable and traceable errors.
  The package ""checkmate"" provides a plethora of functions to check the type
and related properties of the most frequently used R objects and variable
types. The package is mostly written in C to avoid any unnecessary performance
overhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently write concise, well-tested
assertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Furthermore,
checkmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework ""testthat"" by
extending it with plenty of additional expectation functions, and registered C
routines are available for package developers to perform assertions on
arbitrary SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects implemented as struct in
C) in compiled code.

residues in solvation dynamics by selecting residues often used as natural
probes, namely tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine, located at different
positions on protein surface and having various degrees of solvent exposure.
Such differently placed residues are found to exhibit different timescales of
relaxation. The total solvation response, as measured by the probe is
decomposed in terms of its interactions with (i) protein core, (ii) side-chain
atoms and (iii) water molecules. Significant anti cross-correlations among
these contributions are observed as a result of side-chain assisted energy flow
between protein core and hydration layer, which is important for the proper
functionality of a protein. It is also observed that there are rotationally
faster as well as slower water molecules than that of bulk solvent, which are
considered to be responsible for the multitude of timescales that are observed
in solvation dynamics. We also establish that slow solvation derives a
significant contribution from protein side-chain fluctuations. When the motion
of the protein side-chains is forcefully quenched, solvation either becomes
faster or slower depending on the location of the probe.

known as matrix denoising, is a fundamental inverse problem in statistical
signal processing. Matrix denoising methods are generally based on shrinkage or
thresholding of singular values with a predetermined shrinkage parameter or
threshold. However, most of the existing adaptive shrinkage methods use
multiple parameters to obtain a better flexibility in shrinkage. The optimal
value of these parameters using either cross-validation or Stein's principle.
In both the cases, the iterative estimation of various parameters render the
existing shrinkage methods computationally latent for most of the real-time
applications. This paper presents an efficient data dependent shrinkage
function whose parameters are estimated using Stein's principle but in a
non-iterative manner, thereby providing a comparatively faster shrinkage
method. In addition, the proposed estimator is found to be consistent with the
recently proposed asymptotically optimal estimators using the results from
random matrix theory. The experimental studies on artificially generated
low-rank matrices and on the magnetic resonant imagery data, show the efficacy
of the proposed denoising method.
