microscopic and macroscopic objects in statistical models. Tropical algebra
gives a common framework for macrosystems (subsets) and their elementary
constituents (elements) that is well-behaved with respect to composition. This
kind of connection is studied with maps that preserve a monoid structure. The
approach highlights an underlying order relation that is explored through the
concepts of filter and ideal. Particular attention is paid to asymmetry and
duality between max- and min-criteria. Physical implementations are presented
through simple examples in thermodynamics and non-equilibrium physics. The
phenomenon of ultrametricity, the notion of tropical equilibrium and the role
of ground energy in non-equilibrium models are discussed. Tropical symmetry,
i.e. idempotence, is investigated.

implicit assumption, and that of transitivity a frequent explicit one. By
compactness arguments, local finiteness guarantees several regularity
properties. It is generally easy to find counterexamples to such regularity
results when the assumption of local finiteness is dropped. The present work
focuses on the following problem: determining whether these regularity
properties still hold when local finiteness is replaced by an assumption of
transitivity.
  After recalling the locally finite situation, we show that there are Cayley
graphs with infinite generating systems that have infinite diameter but do not
contain any infinite geodesic ray. We also introduce a notion of generalised
diameter. The generalised diameter of a graph is either an ordinal or ""truly
infinite"" and captures the extension properties of geodesic paths. It is a
finite ordinal if and only if the usual diameter is finite, and in that case
the two notions agree. Besides, the generalised diameter is ""truly infinite"" if
and only if the considered graph contains an infinite geodesic ray. We show
that there exist Cayley graphs of abelian groups of arbitrary generalised
diameter.
  Finally, we build Cayley graphs of abelian groups that have isomorphic balls
of radius R for every R but are not globally isomorphic. This enables us to
construct a non-transitive graph such that for every R and any vertices u and
v, the ball of centre u and radius R is isomorphic to that of centre v and same
radius.

prebiotically important molecules or even nascent life may have formed on Mars
and been transferred to Earth. UV light plays a key role in prebiotic
chemistry. Characterizing the early Martian surface UV environment is key to
understanding how Mars compares to Earth as a venue for prebiotic chemistry.
  Here, we present two-stream multi-layer calculations of the UV surface
radiance on Mars at 3.9 Ga, to constrain the surface UV environment as a
function of atmospheric state. We explore a wide range of atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and compositions, corresponding to the diversity of
Martian atmospheric states consistent with available constraints. We include
the effects of clouds and dust. We calculate dose rates to quantify the effect
of different atmospheric states on UV-sensitive prebiotic chemistry.
  We find that for normative clear-sky CO2-H2O atmospheres, the UV environment
on young Mars is comparable to young Earth. This similarity is robust to
moderate cloud cover: thick clouds ($\tau$>100) are required to significantly
affect the Martian UV environment, because cloud absorption is degenerate with
atmospheric CO2. On the other hand, absorption from SO2, H2S, and dust is
nondegenerate with CO2, meaning if they can build up to high levels, surface UV
fluence will be suppressed. These absorbers have spectrally variable
absorption, meaning that their presence affects prebiotic pathways in different
ways. In particular, high SO2 environments may admit UV fluence that favors
pathways conducive to abiogenesis over pathways unfavorable to it. However,
better measurements of the spectral quantum yields of these pathways are
required to evaluate this hypothesis definitively.

employing femtosecond time resolved X-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity

that the sub-picosecond magnetization quenching is accompanied by strong
changes in non-magnetic X-ray reflectivity. These changes vary with reflection

conceptual geological models are represented by multiple-point statistics

different ways. First, dominant modes are identified by analysis of the
frequency content in the realizations, which drastically reduces the model
parameter space in the frequency-amplitude domain. Second, the distributions of
global, summary metrics (e.g. model roughness) are used to formulate a prior
probability density function. The inverse problem is formulated in a Bayesian
framework and the posterior pdf is sampled using Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulation. The usefulness and applicability of this method is demonstrated on
two case studies in which synthetic crosshole ground-penetrating radar
traveltime data are inverted to recover 2-D porosity fields. The use of prior
information from TIs significantly enhances the reliability of the posterior
models by removing inversion artefacts and improving individual parameter
estimates. The proposed methodology reduces the ambiguity inherent in the

Changes in the indentation depth under constant applied load were monitored

the probe using an interferometric method. In addition, shear properties of the
indented films were measured using a lateral contact method. In the case of
poly(PEGMA) films, we show that poroelastic indentation behavior is adequately
described within the framework of an approximate contact model derived within
the limits of confined contact geometries. This model provides simple scaling
laws for the characteristic poroelastic time and the equilibrium indentation
depth. Conversely, deviations from this model are evidenced for poly(DMA) and
poly(NIPAM) films. From lateral contact experiments, these deviations are found
to result from strong changes in the shear properties as a result of glass

the drainage of the confined films squeezed between the rigid substrates.

coordinated fashion thanks to vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. When applied at
a larger scale, platooning will create significant opportunities for energy
savings due to reduced aerodynamic drag, as well as increased road capacity and
congestion reduction resulting from shorter vehicle headways. However, these
potential savings are maximized if platooning-capable vehicles spend most of
their travel time within platoons. Ad hoc platoon formation may not ensure a
high rate of platoon driving. In this paper we consider the problem of central
coordination of platooning-capable vehicles. By coordinating their routes and
departure times, we can maximize the fuel savings afforded by platooning
vehicles. The resulting problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that
considers the platoon coordination and vehicle routing problems simultaneously.
We demonstrate our methodology by evaluating the benefits of a coordinated
solution and comparing it with the uncoordinated case when platoons form only
in an ad hoc manner. We compare the coordinated and uncoordinated scenarios on
a grid network with different assumptions about demand and the time vehicles
are willing to wait.

this limitation and propose a novel controller for HAS clients that is able to
reach quality fairness while preserving the main characteristics of HAS systems

price-based mechanism in order to build a controller that maximizes the
aggregate video quality for a set of HAS clients that share a common
bottleneck. When network resources are scarce, the clients with simple video
sequences reduce the requested bitrate in favor of users that subscribe to more
complex video sequences, leading to a more efficient network usage. The
proposed controller has been implemented in a network simulator, and the

2012cu to be consistent with those of the Milky Way. Furthermore we find no

also compare the dust extinction curve models of Cardelli et al. (1989),
O'Donnell (1994), and Fitzpatrick (1999), and find the predictions of

that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of

for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the

to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks
for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently,
processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human
behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings

pressure ($P_{\rm th}$) of the diffuse, neutral gas. By combining [C II] 158
$\mu$m, HI, and CO data from 31 galaxies selected from the Herschel KINGFISH
sample, we have measured thermal pressures in 534 predominantly atomic regions
with typical sizes of $\sim$1 kiloparsec. We find a distribution of thermal
pressures in the $P_{\rm th}/k\sim10^3-10^5$ K cm$^{-3}$ range. For a
sub-sample of regions with conditions similar to those of the diffuse, neutral
gas in the Galactic plane, we find thermal pressures that follow a log-normal
distribution with a median value of $P_{\rm th}/k\approx3600$ K cm$^{-3}$.
These results are consistent with thermal pressure measurements using other
observational methods. We find that $P_{\rm th}$ increases with radiation field
strength and star formation activity, as expected from the close link between
the heating of the gas and the star formation rate. Our thermal pressure
measurements fall in the regime where a two-phase ISM with cold and warm
neutral medium could exist in pressure equilibrium. Finally, we find that the
midplane thermal pressure of the diffuse gas is about $\sim30$% of the vertical
weight of the overlying ISM, consistent with results from hydrodynamical
simulations of self-regulated star formation in galactic disks.

fossil relativistic electrons from active galactic nuclei are re-accelerated at
cluster shocks. It also implies that radio galaxies play an important role in
governing the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium in merging

discrete packets of quantum information along one direction. In
non-fractionalized systems with only bosonic excitations, this pumping is
quantified by a dynamical topological index that is a rational number --
highlighting its difference from the integer valued invariant underlying
equilibrium chiral phases (e.g. quantum Hall systems). Here, we explore CF
phases in systems with emergent anyon excitations that have fractional
statistics (Abelian topological order). Despite the absence of mobile
non-Abelian particles in these systems, external driving can supply the energy
to pump otherwise immobile non-Abelian defects (sometimes called twist defects
or genons) around the boundary, thereby transporting an irrational fractional
number of quantum bits along the edge during each drive period. This enables
new CF phases with chiral indices that are square roots of rational numbers,
inspiring the label: ""radical CF phases"". We demonstrate an unexpected
bulk-boundary correspondence, in which the radical CF edge is tied to bulk
dynamics that exchange electric and magnetic anyon excitations during each
period. We construct solvable, stroboscopically driven versions of Kitaev's
honeycomb spin model that realize these radical CF phases, and discuss their

We introduce a method to reconstruct the rotation of a galactic corona, based
on its angular momentum distribution (AMD). This allows us to investigate in
what conditions the angular momentum acquired from tidal torques can be
transferred to star forming discs and explain observed galaxy-scale processes,
such as inside-out growth and the build-up of abundance gradients. We find that
a simple model of an isothermal corona with a temperature slightly smaller than
virial and a cosmologically motivated AMD is in good agreement with galaxy
evolution requirements, supporting hot-mode accretion as a viable driver for
the evolution of spiral galaxies in a cosmological context. We predict
moderately sub-centrifugal rotation close to the disc and slow rotation close
to the virial radius. Motivated by the observation that the Milky Way has a
relatively hot corona (T ~ 2 x 10^6 K), we also explore models with a
temperature larger than virial. To be able to drive inside-out growth, these
models must be significantly affected by feedback, either mechanical (ejection
of low angular momentum material) or thermal (heating of the central regions).
However, the agreement with galaxy evolution constraints becomes, in these
cases, only marginal, suggesting that our first and simpler model may apply to
a larger fraction of galaxy evolution history.

We find that this has already fallen to $379^{+34}_{-28}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$
at a radius of 50 kpc. Through measuring the escape speed and its variation, we
obtain constraints on the Galactic potential as a whole. In particular, the
gradient in the escape speed with radius suggests that the total mass contained
within 50 kpc is $29^{+7}_{-5}\times10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a
relatively light dark halo for the Milky Way. Our method represents a novel way
of estimating the mass of the Galaxy, and has very different systematics to
more commonly used models of tracers, which are more sensitive to the central
parts of the halo velocity distributions. Using our inference on the escape

For each dwarf we consider, we predict small pericenter radii and large orbital

atmospheric dynamics, we analyze Hinode, IRIS, and SDO data of a new EFR in
NOAA AR 12401. Out of 151 bright points (BPs) identified in Hinode/SOT Ca
images, 29 are overlapped by an SOT/SP scan. Seven BPs in the EFR center
possess mixed-polarity magnetic backgrounds in the photosphere. Their IRIS UV
spectra (e.g., Si IV 1402.8 A) are strongly enhanced and red- or blue-shifted
with tails reaching +/- 150 km/s, which is highly suggestive of bi-directional
jets, and each brightening lasts for 10 - 15 minutes leaving flare-like light
curves. Most of this group show bald patches, the U-shaped photospheric
magnetic loops. Another 10 BPs are found in unipolar regions at the EFR edges.
They are generally weaker in UV intensities and exhibit systematic redshifts
with Doppler speeds up to 40 km/s, which could exceed the local sound speed in
the transition region. Both types of BPs show signs of strong temperature
increase in the low chromosphere. These observational results support the
physical picture that heating events in the EFR center are due to magnetic
reconnection within cancelling undular fields like Ellerman bombs, while the
peripheral heating events are due to shocks or strong compressions caused by
fast downflows along the overlying arch filament system.

These SMGs were selected originally using AzTEC at 1100 micron, and are
observed by Herschel to be faint at 100--500 micron. Their (sub)millimeter
colors are as red as -- or redder -- than known z>~5 SMGs; indeed,
ASXDF1100.053.1 is redder than HFLS 3, which lies at z=6.3. They are also faint
and red in the near-/mid-infrared: ~1 microJy at IRAC 4.5 micron and <0.2
microJy in the Ks filter. These SMGs are also faint in the radio waveband,
where F_6GHz=4.5 microJy for ASXDF1100.053.1 and F_1.4GHz=28 microJy for

properties of ASXDF1100.053.1 for z=5.5--7.5 and 231.1 for z=3.5--5.5 are as
follows: their infrared luminosities are [6.5-7.4]x10^{12} and
[4.2-4.5]x10^{12} L_sun; their stellar masses are [0.9-2]x10^{11} and
[0.4-3]x10^{10} M_sun; their circularized half-light radii in the ALMA maps are
~1 and <~0.2 kpc (~2--3 kpc for 90% of the total flux). Lastly, their surface
infrared luminosity densities, Sigma_IR, are ~1x10^{12} and >~1.5x10^{13} L_sun
kpc^{-2}, similar to values seen for local (U)LIRGs. These data suggest that
ASXDF1100.053.1 and 231.1 are compact SMGs at z>~4 and can plausibly evolve

density (PPSD) in CDM halos. We study fluid collapse, using the close analogy
between the gas entropy and the PPSD in the fluid approximation. Our
hydrodynamic calculations allow for a precise evaluation of logarithmic
derivatives. For scale-free initial conditions, entropy is a power law in
Lagrangian (mass) coordinates, but not in Eulerian (radial) coordinates. The
deviation from a radial power law arises from incomplete hydrostatic
equilibrium (HSE), linked to bulk inflow and mass accretion, and the
convergence to the asymptotic central power-law slope is very slow. For more
realistic collapse, entropy is not a power law with either radius or mass due
to deviations from HSE and scale-dependent initial conditions. Instead, it is a
slowly rolling power law that appears approximately linear on a log-log plot.
Our fluid calculations recover PPSD power-law slopes and residual amplitudes
similar to N-body simulations, indicating that deviations from a power law are
not numerical artefacts. In addition, we find that realistic collapse is not
self-similar: scale lengths such as the shock radius and the turnaround radius
are not power-law functions of time. We therefore argue that the apparent
power-law PPSD cannot be used to make detailed dynamical inferences or
extrapolate halo profiles inward, and that it does not indicate any hidden
integrals of motion. We also suggest that the apparent agreement between the
PPSD and the asymptotic Bertschinger slope is purely coincidental.

approach have recently emerged from separate proposals addressing, for example,
quantum chemistry and combinatorial problems. These algorithms provide an
approximate solution to the problem at hand by encoding it in the state of a
quantum computer. The operations used to prepare the state are not a priori
fixed but, quite the opposite, are subjected to a classical optimization
procedure that modifies the quantum gates and improves the quality of the
approximate solution. While the quantum hardware determines the size of the
problem and what states are achievable (limited, respectively, by the number of
qubits and by the kind and number of possible quantum gates), it is the
classical optimization procedure that determines the way in which the quantum
states are explored and whether the best available solution is actually
reached. In addition, the quantities required in the optimization, for example
the objective function itself, have to be estimated with finite precision in
any experimental implementation. While it is desirable to have very precise
estimates, this comes at the cost of repeating the state preparation and
measurement multiple times. Here we analyze the competing requirements of high
precision and low number of repetitions and study how the overall performance
of the variational algorithm is affected by the precision level and the choice
of the optimization method. Finally, this study introduces quasi-Newton
optimization methods in the general context of hybrid variational algorithms
and presents quantitative results for the Quantum Approximate Optimization

been useful in examining inflation and dark energy, can also be used to
establish a systematic approach to inflationary reheating. We consider two
methods. First, we extend Weinberg's background EFT to the end of inflation and
reheating. We establish when parametric resonance and decay of the inflaton
occurs, but also find intrinsic theoretical limitations, which make it
difficult to capture some reheating models. This motivates us to next consider
Cheung, et. al.'s EFT approach, which instead focuses on perturbations and the
symmetry breaking induced by the cosmological background. Adapting the latter
approach to reheating implies some new and important differences compared to
the EFT of Inflation. In particular, there are new hierarchical scales, and we
must account for inflaton oscillations during reheating, which lead to discrete
symmetry breaking. Guided by the fundamental symmetries, we construct the EFT
of reheating, and as an example of its usefulness we establish a new class of
reheating models and the corresponding predictions for gravity wave
observations. In this paper we primarily focus on the first stages of

novel technique of transforming a discrete differential expression into an
exact equivalent rational continuum derivative form is developed considering
the Taylor's series transformation of the continuous field variables and
traveling wave type of solutions for both the discrete and continuum field
variables. An exact equivalent continuum rod representation of the 1D harmonic

developed to explore their nonlocal properties in general. Some analytical and
numerical studies on the high frequency dynamic behavior of these novel

problems when applied to quiet-Sun data. Here we present a first application to
an active region. We use solar vector magnetic field measurements gathered by
the IMaX polarimeter during the flight of the \sunrise{} balloon-borne solar
observatory in June 2013 as boundary condition for a magneto-static model of
the higher solar atmosphere above an active region. The IMaX data are embedded
in active region vector magnetograms observed with SDO/HMI. This work continues
our magneto-static extrapolation approach, which has been applied earlier ({\it
Paper I}) to a quiet Sun region observed with \sunrise{} I. In an active region
the signal-to-noise-ratio in the measured Stokes parameters is considerably
higher than in the quiet Sun and consequently the IMaX measurements of the
horizontal photospheric magnetic field allow us to specify the free parameters
of the model in a special class of linear magneto-static equilibria. The high
spatial resolution of IMaX (110-130 km, pixel size 40 km) enables us to model
the non-force-free layer between the photosphere and the mid chromosphere
vertically by about 50 grid points. In our approach we can incorporate some
aspects of the mixed beta layer of photosphere and chromosphere, e.g., taking a
finite Lorentz force into account, which was not possible with lower resolution
photospheric measurements in the past. The linear model does not, however,
permit to model intrinsic nonlinear structures like strongly localized electric
currents.

Due to transistor mismatch each pixel circuit needs to be calibrated
individually to achieve response uniformity. Traditionally this is addressed by
programmable threshold trimming in each pixel, but requires robustness against
radiation effects, temperature, and time. In this paper a self-adjusting
threshold mechanism is presented, which corrects the threshold for both spatial
inequality and time variation and maintains a constant response. It exploits
the electrical noise as relative measure for the threshold and automatically
adjust the threshold of each pixel to always achieve a uniform frequency of
noise hits. A digital implementation of the method in the form of an up/down
counter and combinatorial logic filter is presented. The behavior of this
circuit has been simulated to evaluate its performance and compare it to

equation we obtain a local energy decay that is almost sharp from the scaling
point of view, but nonetheless misses the classical estimates by a gap. This
work is inspired by the work of Klainerman on $L^2$---$L^\infty$ decay of wave
equations, as well as the recent work of Fajman, Joudioux, and Smulevici on
decay of mass distributions for the relativistic Vlasov equation.

The first one, used in practice, is based on an extension of DPLL for model
counting called exhaustive DPLL. The second approach, more theoretical,
exploits the structure of the input to compute the number of satisfying
assignments by usually using a dynamic programming scheme on a decomposition of
the formula. In this paper, we make a first step toward the separation of these
two techniques by exhibiting a family of formulas that can be solved in
polynomial time with the first technique but needs an exponential time with the
second one. We show this by observing that both techniques implicitely
construct a very specific boolean circuit equivalent to the input formula. We
then show that every beta-acyclic formula can be represented by a polynomial
size circuit corresponding to the first method and exhibit a family of
beta-acyclic formulas which cannot be represented by polynomial size circuits
corresponding to the second method. This result shed a new light on the
complexity of #SAT and related problems on beta-acyclic formulas. As a
byproduct, we give new handy tools to design algorithms on beta-acyclic
hypergraphs.

traditional alternatives. If it can be said that there is a consensus on the
form of response theories in driven, nonequilibrium transient dynamics, then
that consensus is consistent with maximizing the entropy of a distribution over
transition space. This agreement requires the problem of force/flux
relationships to be described entirely in terms of such transition
distributions, rather than steady-state properties (such as near-equilibrium
works) or distributions over trajectory space (such as maximum caliber). Within
the transition space paradigm, it is actually simpler to work in the fully
nonlinear regime without relying on any assumptions about the steady-state or
long-time properties. Our results are compared to extensive numerical
simulations of two very different systems. The first is a the periodic Lorentz
gas under constant external force, extended with angular velocity and
physically realistic inelastic scattering. The second is an
$\alpha$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain, extended with a Langevin thermostat that
couples only to individual harmonic modes. Although we simulate both starting
from transient initial conditions, the maximum entropy structure of the
transition distribution is clearly evident on both atomistic and intermediate

nonequilibrium statistical mechanics by employing analogies with standard
maximum entropy techniques -- even in cases where large deviation principles
cannot be rigorously proven.

research on misconceptions, testing, and teaching strategies for introductory

analyzed for the misconceptions, research tools, teaching strategies and

their contribution to the various subtopics of quantum mechanics. Analysis
shows that students have difficulty relating quantum physics to physical
reality. It also shows that the teaching of complex quantum behavior, such as
time dependence, superposition and the measurement problem, has barely been
investigated for the secondary and lower undergraduate level. At the secondary
school level, this review shows a need to investigate student difficulties
concerning wave functions and potential wells. Investigation of research tools
shows the necessity for the development of assessment tools for secondary and
lower undergraduate education, which cover all major topics and are suitable
for statistical analysis. Furthermore, this review shows the existence of very
diverse ideas concerning teaching strategies for quantum mechanics and a lack
of research into which strategies promote understanding. This review underlines
the need for more empirical research into student difficulties, teaching
strategies, activities and research tools intended for a conceptual approach

a sufficient amount of damage, the channel ceases to convey signals. Constant
composition codes are adopted to obtain an achievability bound and the
left-concave right-convex inequality is then refined to obtain a converse bound
on the log-volume throughput for channels that wear out. Since infinite
blocklength codes will always wear out the channel for any finite threshold of
failure and therefore cannot convey information at positive rates, we analyze
the performance of finite blocklength codes to determine the maximum expected
transmission volume at a given level of average error probability. We show that
this maximization problem has a recursive form and can be solved by dynamic
programming. Numerical results demonstrate that a sequence of block codes is
preferred to a single block code for streaming sources.

reported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,
potentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating
at diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield
the dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within

axion stars could be very abundant in galaxies. As a result, collisions with
each other, and with other astrophysical bodies, can occur. We calculate the
rate and analyze the consequences of three classes of collisions, those
occurring between a dilute axion star and: another dilute axion star, an
ordinary star, or a neutron star. In all cases we attempt to quantify the most
important astrophysical uncertainties; we also pay particular attention to
scenarios in which collisions lead to collapse of otherwise stable axion stars,
and possible subsequent decay through number changing interactions. Collisions
between two axion stars can occur with a high total rate, but the low relative
velocity required for collapse to occur leads to a very low total rate of
collapses. On the other hand, collisions between an axion star and an ordinary
star have a large rate, $\Gamma_\odot \sim 3000$ collisions/year/galaxy, and
for sufficiently heavy axion stars, it is plausible that most or all such
collisions lead to collapse. We identify in this case a parameter space which
has a stable region and a region in which collision triggers collapse, which
depend on the axion number ($N$) in the axion star, and a ratio of mass to
radius cubed characterizing the ordinary star ($M_s/R_s^3$). Finally, we
revisit the calculation of collision rates between axion stars and neutron
stars, improving on previous estimates by taking cylindrical symmetry of the
neutron star distribution into account. Collapse and subsequent decay through
collision processes, if occurring with a significant rate, can affect dark
matter phenomenology and the axion star mass distribution.

should be taken with caution because of the red-noise. Beside these periods,
there are several short-term (1-5 days) flare-like events in the light-curves.
There are good correlations between the continuum fluxes and H{\alpha} and

different weighted l2-norms by simply applying a weighting function within the
least-squares formulation. In addition, a goal-oriented semi-norm induced by an

as a linear functional of the solution. We establish optimality and error
bounds for the proposed method, and extensive numerical experiments show that
the weighted LSPG methods outperforms other spectral methods in minimizing

electrons are swept away from the axis, is presently considered to be the

generate mock halos created by stochastic magnetic fields with and without

the magnetic field. We propose a sharper version of the Q-statistics and
demonstrate its sensitivity to the magnetic field strength, the coherence

distribution of capacitance of the disordered mesoscopic capacitors for three
different ensembles: orthogonal (symmetry index \beta=1), unitary (\beta=2),
and symplectic (\beta=4). It is found that the electrochemical capacitance in
the disordered systems exhibits universal behavior. In the case of single
conducting channel, the electrochemical capacitance follows a symmetric
Gaussian distribution at weak disorders as expected from the random matrix
theory. In the strongly disordered regime, the distribution is found to be a
sharply one-sided form with a nearly-constant tail in the large capacitance
region. This behavior is due to the existence of the necklace states in
disordered systems, which is characterized by the multi-resonance that gives
rise to a large density of states. In addition, it is found that the necklace
state also enhances the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance in the case
of single conducting channel. When the number of conducting channels increases,
the influence of necklace states becomes less important. For large number of
conducting channels, the electrochemical capacitance fluctuation develops a
plateau region in the strongly disordered regime. The plateau value is
identified as universal electrochemical capacitance fluctuation, which is
independent of system parameters such as disorder strength, Fermi energy,
geometric capacitance, and system size. Importantly, the universal

have been studying difficulties in understanding magnetism encountered by
students in the calculus-based introductory physics courses. A majority of
these students are engineering majors. Student difficulties were assessed by
administering written free-response questions and by developing and
administering a research-based multiple-choice test to students. We also
conducted individual interviews with a subset of students. Some of these
interviews were lecture-demonstration based interviews in which students were
asked to predict the outcomes of experiments, perform the experiments and
reconcile the differences between their predictions and observations. Some of
the common misconceptions found in magnetism are analogous to those found in
electrostatics. Some additional difficulties are due to the non-intuitive three
dimensional nature of the relation between magnetic field, magnetic force and
velocity of the charged particles or direction of current. Another finding is
that students often used their gut feeling and had more difficulty reconciling
with the idea that the magnetic force and field are perpendicular to each other
when they were shown actual lecture-demonstration setups and asked to predict
outcomes of experiments than when they were asked to explain relation between
magnetic force and field theoretically solely based upon an equation. We
discuss the implications of this research to teaching and learning.

examine the power of quantum annealers to provide a different type of quantum
enhancement of practical relevance, namely, their ability to serve as useful
samplers from the ground-state manifolds of combinatorial optimization
problems. We study, both numerically by simulating ideal stoquastic and
non-stoquastic quantum annealing processes, and experimentally, using a
commercially available quantum annealing processor, the ability of quantum
annealers to sample the ground-states of spin glasses differently than
classical thermal samplers. We demonstrate that i) quantum annealers in general
sample the ground-state manifolds of spin glasses very differently than thermal
optimizers, ii) the nature of the quantum fluctuations driving the annealing
process has a decisive effect on the final distribution over ground-states, and
iii) the experimental quantum annealer samples ground-state manifolds
significantly differently than thermal and ideal quantum annealers. We
illustrate how quantum annealers may serve as powerful tools when complementing
standard sampling algorithms.

essentially a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator searching parameters of
interest in a high dimensional space. However, the complexity of this method
increases exponentially with the number G of targets.Besides, without the prior
information of the number of targets, a multi-hypothesis testing strategy to
determine the number of targets is required, which further complicates this
method. Therefore, we split the joint maximization into G disjoint optimization
problems by clearing the interference from previously declared targets. In this
way, we derive two fast and robust suboptimal solutions which allow trading
performance for a much lower implementation complexity which is almost
independent of the number of targets. In addition, the multi-hypothesis testing
is no longer required when target number is unknown. Simulation results show
the proposed algorithms can correctly detect and accurately localize multiple
targets even when targets share common range bins in some paths.

real practice, the incentive mechanism is typically not an isolated module, but
interacts with the data aggregation mechanism that aggregates workers' data.
For this reason, we propose CENTURION, a novel integrated framework for

  We propose the first algorithm to compute influence spread exactly under the

computes influence spread by dynamic programming on the constructed BDDs. To
construct the BDDs efficiently, we designed a new frontier-based search-type

influence-spread related problems, such as random sampling without rejection,
conditional influence spread evaluation, dynamic probability update, and
gradient computation for probability optimization problems.
  We conducted computational experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm.
The algorithm successfully computed influence spread on real-world networks

properly engineered in experimental setups, and could lead to a new controlling
tool for gaps and transport properties. Here, we analyze the electronic
properties of folded AGNRs relating the electronic responses and the mechanical
deformation. An important and universal parameter for the gap engineering is
the ribbon percent width variation, i.e., the difference between the deformed
and undeformed ribbon widths. AGNRs bandgap can be tuned mechanically in a well
defined bounded range of energy values, eventually leading to a metallic
system. This characteristic provides a new controllable degree of freedom that
allows manipulation of electronic currents. We show that the numerical results
are analytically predicted by solving the Dirac equation for the strained
system.

black holes without spins has been investigated with numerical relativistic
simulations. We adopt the parabolic approximation which assumes that the
gravitational wave radiation from a weakly hyperbolic orbit is the same as that
from the parabolic orbit having the same pericenter distance. Using the
radiated energies from the parabolic orbit simulations, we have obtained the
critical impact parameter ($b_{\rm crit}$) for the GR capture for weakly
hyperbolic orbit as a function of initial energy. The most energetic encounters
occur around the boundary between the direct merging and the fly-by orbits, and
can emit several percent of initial total ADM energy at the peak. When the
total mass is fixed, energy and angular momentum radiated in the case of
unequal mass black holes are smaller than those of equal mass black holes
having the same initial orbital angular momentum for the fly-by orbits. We have
compared our results with two different Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations, the
exact parabolic orbit (EPO) and PN corrected orbit (PNCO). We find that the
agreement between the EPO and the numerical relativity breaks down for very
close encounters ($\it{e.g.}$, $b_{\rm crit} \lesssim 100$ M), and it becomes
worse for higher mass ratios. For instance, the critical impact parameters can
differ by more than $50\%$ from those obtained in EPO if the relative velocity
at infinity $v_{\infty}$ is larger than 0.1 for the mass ratio of
$m_{1}/m_{2}=16$. The PNCO gives more consistent results than EPO, but it also

matrices with low non-trivial aperiodic auto- and cross- correlation sums. For
multicarrier code-division multiple-access applications, the availability of
large QCSSs with low correlation sums is desirable. The generalized Levenshtein
bound (GLB) is a lower bound on the maximum aperiodic correlation sum of QCSSs.
The bounding expression of GLB is a fractional quadratic function of a weight
vector $\mathbf{w}$ and is expressed in terms of three additional parameters
associated with QCSS: the set size $K$, the number of channels $M$, and the
sequence length $N$. It is known that a tighter GLB (compared to the Welch
bound) is possible only if the condition $M\geq2$ and $K\geq \overline{K}+1$,
where $\overline{K}$ is a certain function of $M$ and $N$, is satisfied. A
challenging research problem is to determine if there exists a weight vector
which gives rise to a tighter GLB for \textit{all} (not just \textit{some})
$K\geq \overline{K}+1$ and $M\geq2$, especially for large $N$, i.e., the
condition is {asymptotically} both necessary and sufficient. To achieve this,
we \textit{analytically} optimize the GLB which is (in general) non-convex as
the numerator term is an indefinite quadratic function of the weight vector.
Our key idea is to apply the frequency domain decomposition of the circulant
matrix (in the numerator term) to convert the non-convex problem into a convex
one. Following this optimization approach, we derive a new weight vector
meeting the aforementioned objective and prove that it is a local minimizer of

find that the local $\mathcal{B}_3$ geometry, which is a three-point blow-up of
local $\mathbb{P}^2$, is associated with electrons on a triangular lattice.
This correspondence allows us to use known results in condensed matter physics
to investigate the quantum geometry of the toric Calabi--Yau manifold.

applications like magnetocaloric refrigeration and actuation based on the
magnetic shape memory effect. Their outstanding functional properties depend on
low hysteresis losses and low actuation fields. These are only achieved if the
atomic positions deviate from a tetragonal lattice by periodic displacements.
The origin of the so-called modulated structures is the subject of much
controversy: They are either explained by phonon softening or adaptive
nanotwinning. Here we used large-scale density functional theory calculations
on the Ni2MnGa prototype system to demonstrate interaction energy between twin
boundaries. Minimizing the interaction energy resulted in the experimentally
observed ordered modulations at the atomic scale, it explained that a/b twin
boundaries are stacking faults at the mesoscale, and contributed substantially
to the macroscopic hysteresis losses. Furthermore, we found that phonon
softening paves the transformation path towards the nanotwinned martensite
state. This unified both opposing concepts to explain modulated martensite.

progenitors of massive clusters in the inner Galaxy. Sensitive mid-infrared
data at 21-24 $\mu$m from the WISE and MIPSGAL surveys were explored to search
for embedded objects, and complementary spectroscopic data were used to
investigate their stability and star formation activity. Based on such
ancillary data we identify an unbiased sample of infrared-quiet massive clumps
in the Galaxy that potentially represent the earliest stages of massive cluster
formation. An important fraction of this sample consists of sources that have
not been studied in detail before. Comparing their properties to clumps hosting
more evolved embedded objects, we find that they exhibit similar physical
properties in terms of mass and size, suggesting that infrared-quiet massive
clumps are not only capable of forming high-mass stars, but likely also follow
a single evolutionary track leading to the formation of massive clusters. The
majority of the sources are not in virial-equilibrium, suggesting collapse on
the clump scale. This is in line with the low number of infrared-quiet massive
clumps and earlier findings that star formation, in particular for high-mass
objects is a fast, dynamic process. We propose a scenario in which massive
clumps start to fragment and collapse before their final mass is accumulated
indicating that strong self-gravity and global collapse is needed to build up
rich clusters and the most massive stars.

doping concentration (x) was investigated by means of magnetization hysteresis
loop (MHL) measurements on single-crystal samples. Depending on the dopant
elements and their concentration, Jc exhibits a variety of magnetic-field (H)
and temperature (T) dependences. (1) In the case of K-Ba122, MHL of the
underdoped samples (x < 0.33) exhibits the second magnetization peak (SMP),
which sustains high Jc at high H and high T, exceeding 10^5 A/cm2 at T = 25 K
and H = 6 T for x = 0.30. On the other hand, SMP is missing in the optimally (x
~ 0.36-0.40) and overdoped (x ~ 0.50) samples, and consequently Jc rapidly
decreases by more than one order of magnitude, although the change in Tc is
within a few K. (2) For Co-Ba122, SMP is always present over the entire
superconducting (SC) dome from the under (x ~ 0.05) to the overdoped (x ~ 0.12)
region. However, the magnitude of Jc significantly changes with x, exhibiting a
sharp maximum at x ~ 0.057, which is a slightly underdoped composition for
Co-Ba122. (3) For P-Ba122, the highest Jc is attained at x = 0.30 corresponding
to the highest Tc composition. For the overdoped samples, MHL is characterized
by SMP located close to the irreversibility field. Common to the three doping
variations, Jc becomes highest at the under-doping side of SC dome near the
phase boundary between SC phase and the antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic phase.
Also, the peak appears in a narrow range of doping, distinct from the Tc dome
with broad maximum. These similarities in the three cases indicate that the
observed doping dependence of Jc is intrinsic to the BaFe2As2-based
superconductors.

gravity with the Minkowski fiducial metric, in such a way that the quasidilaton
global symmetry is maintained and that the theory admits a stable
self-accelerating de Sitter solution. We start with a precursor theory that
contains three propagating gravitational degrees of freedom without a
quasidilaton scalar and introduce St\""uckelberg fields to covariantize its
action. This makes it possible for us to formulate the quasidilaton global
symmetry that mixes the St\""uckelberg fields and the quasidilaton scalar field.
By the Hamiltonian analysis we confirm that the precursor theory with the
quasidilaton scalar contains four degrees of freedom, three from the precursor
massive gravity and one from the quasidilaton scalar. We further remove one
propagating degree of freedom to construct the minimal quasidilaton theory with
three propagating degrees of freedom, corresponding to two polarizations of
gravitational waves from the minimal theory of massive gravity and one scalar
from the quasidilaton field, by carefully introducing two additional
constraints to the system in the Hamiltonian language. Switching to the
Lagrangian language, we find self-accelerating de Sitter solutions in the
minimal quasidilaton theory and analyze their stability. It is found that the
self-accelerating de Sitter solution is stable in a wide range of parameters.

method for distance determination; it converts radial velocities into pulsation
velocities. Several methods are used to determine p, such as geometrical and
hydrodynamical models or the inverse BW approach when the distance is known. We
analyze new HARPS-N spectra of delta Cep to measure its cycle-averaged
atmospheric velocity gradient in order to better constrain the projection
factor. We first apply the inverse BW method to derive p directly from
observations. The projection factor can be divided into three subconcepts: (1)
a geometrical effect (p0); (2) the velocity gradient within the atmosphere
(fgrad); and (3) the relative motion of the optical pulsating photosphere with
respect to the corresponding mass elements (fo-g). We then measure the fgrad
value of delta Cep for the first time. When the HARPS-N mean cross-correlated
line-profiles are fitted with a Gaussian profile, the projection factor is
pcc-g = 1.239 +/- 0.034(stat) +/- 0.023(syst). When we consider the different
amplitudes of the radial velocity curves that are associated with 17 selected
spectral lines, we measure projection factors ranging from 1.273 to 1.329. We
find a relation between fgrad and the line depth measured when the Cepheid is
at minimum radius. This relation is consistent with that obtained from our best
hydrodynamical model of delta Cep and with our projection factor decomposition.
Using the observational values of p and fgrad found for the 17 spectral lines,
we derive a semi-theoretical value of fo-g. We alternatively obtain fo-g =
0.975+/-0.002 or 1.006+/-0.002 assuming models using radiative transfer in
plane-parallel or spherically symmetric geometries, respectively. The new
HARPS-N observations of delta Cep are consistent with our decomposition of the

'physically universal' cellular automata or Hamiltonians. The latter were
previously defined as systems that admit the implementation of any desired
transformation on a finite target region by first initializing the state of the
surrounding and then letting the system evolve according to its autonomous
dynamics. This way, one obtains a model of control where each region can play
both roles the controller or the system to be controlled. In physically
universal systems every degree of freedom is indirectly accessible by operating
on the remaining degrees of freedom.
  In a nutshell, the thermodynamic cost of an operation is then given by the
size of the region around the target region that needs to be initialized. In
the meantime, physically universal CAs have been constructed by Schaeffer (in
two dimensions) and Salo & T\""orm\""a (in one dimension). Here we show that in
Schaeffer's CA the cost for implementing $n$ operations grows linearly in $n$,
while operating in a thermodynamic cycle requires sublinear growth to ensure
zero cost *per operation* in the limit $n\to\infty$. Although this particular
result need not hold for general physically universal CAs, this strong notion
of universality does imply a certain kind of instability of information, which
could result in lower bounds on the cost of protecting information from its
noisy environment.
  The technical results of the paper are sparse and quite simple. The
contribution of the paper is mainly conceptual and consists in illustrating the
type of thermodynamic questions raised by models of control that rely on the
concept of physical universality.

with the modern tools of differential geometry and of geodesic flow on the
space SDiff of volume-preserving transformations (Arnold, Ann. Inst. Fourier,
vol. 16, 1966, pp. 319-361), all manners of generalisations are here derived.
The Cauchy invariants equation and the Cauchy formula, relating the vorticity

Lie-advection invariance, which are duals of each other (specifically, Hodge
dual). Actually, this is shown to be an instance of a general result, which
holds for flow both in flat (Euclidean) space and in a curved Riemannian space:
any Lie-advection invariant p-form which is exact (i.e. is a differential of a

This constitutes a new fundamental result in linear transport theory, providing
a Lagrangian formulation of Lie advection for some classes of differential
forms. The result has a broad applicability: examples include the

Inversion based on multiple-point statistics is challenging due to high
nonlinearity and time-consuming geostatistical resimulation steps that are
needed to create new model proposals. We propose an entirely new model proposal
mechanism for geophysical inversion that is inspired by texture synthesis in
computer vision. Instead of resimulating pixels based on higher-order patterns
in the training image, we identify a suitable patch of the training image that
replace a corresponding patch in the current model without breaking the
patterns found in the training image, that is, remaining consistent with the
given prior. We consider three cross-hole ground-penetrating radar examples in
which the new model proposal mechanism is employed within an extended
Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion. The model proposal step
is about 40 times faster than state-of-the-art multiple-point statistics
resimulation techniques, the number of necessary MCMC steps is lower and the
quality of the final model realizations is of similar quality. The model
proposal mechanism is presently limited to 2-D fields, but the method is
general and can be applied to a wide range of subsurface settings and

This paper reports on predictions and measurements of this temperature

resonators operated at microwave frequencies. At room temperature, microwave
Bragg resonators have the best potential to reach extremely high Q-factors.
Research has been conducted over the last decade on modeling, optimizing and
realizing such high Q-factor devices for applications such as filtering,
sensing, and frequency metrology. We present an optimized design, which has a
temperature sensitivity 2 to 4 times less than current whispering gallery mode
resonators without using temperature compensating techniques and about 30% less
than other existing Bragg resonators. Also, the performance of a new generation
single-layered Bragg resonators, based on a hybrid-Bragg-mode, is reported with
a sensitivity of about -12ppm/K at 295K. For a single reflector resonator, it
achieves a similar level of performance as a double-Bragg-reflector resonator
but with a more compact structure and performs six times better than
whispering-gallery-mode resonators. The hybrid resonator promises to deliver a

approaches to formulate and solve inverse problems in ways that effectively
integrate geological concepts with geophysical and hydrogeological data. Modern
geostatistical simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface
realizations that are in agreement with conceptual geological models and
statistical rock physics can be used to map these realizations into physical
properties that are sensed by the geophysical or hydrogeological data. The
inverse problem consists of finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface
realizations that are in agreement with the data. The most general inversion
frameworks are presently often computationally intractable when applied to
large-scale problems and it is necessary to better understand the implications
of simplifying (1) the conceptual geological model (e.g., using model
compression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g., using proxy models); and
(3) the algorithm used to solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte
Carlo or local optimization methods) to reach practical and robust solutions
given today's computer resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need to
not only use geophysical and hydrogeological data for parameter estimation
purposes, but also to use them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological

metallicity, provides an ideal laboratory to study star formation in such an
environment. The classical dense molecular gas thermometer NH3 is rarely
available in a low metallicity environment because of photoionization and a
lack of nitrogen atoms. Our goal is to directly measure the gas kinetic
temperature with formaldehyde toward six star-forming regions in the LMC. Three
rotational transitions of para-H2CO near 218 GHz were observed with the APEX
12m telescope toward six star forming regions in the LMC. Those data are
complemented by C18O 2-1 spectra. Using non-LTE modeling with RADEX, we derive
the gas kinetic temperature and spatial density, using as constraints the
measured para-H2CO 321-220/303-202 and para-H2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 ratios.
Excluding the quiescent cloud N159S, where only one para-H2CO line could be
detected, the gas kinetic temperatures derived from the preferred para-H2CO
321-220/303-202 line ratios range from 35 to 63 K with an average of 47 K.
Spatial densities of the gas derived from the paraH2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 line
ratios yield 0.4-2.9x10^5 cm^-3 with an average of 1.5x10^5 cm^-3. Temperatures
derived from the para-H2CO line ratio are similar to those obtained with the
same method from Galactic star forming regions and agree with results derived
from CO in the dense regions of the LMC. A comparison of kinetic temperatures
derived from para-H2CO with those from the dust also shows good agreement. This
suggests that the dust and para-H2CO are well mixed in the studied star forming
regions. A correlation between the gas kinetic temperatures derived from
para-H2CO and infrared luminosity, represented by the 250um flux, suggests that
the kinetic temperatures traced by para-H2CO are correlated with the ongoing
massive star formation in the LMC.

Multilevel Accelerated Lambda Iteration (MALI) has been to the method of choice
to perform high-resolution computations in multidimensional problems. The
disadvantage of MALI is that its computing time scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$,
with $n$ the number of grid points. When the grid gets finer, the computational
cost increases quadratically. We aim to develop a 3D non-LTE radiative transfer
code that is more efficient than MALI. We implement a non-linear multigrid,
fast approximation storage scheme, into the existing Multi3D radiative transfer
code. We verify our multigrid implementation by comparing with MALI
computations. We show that multigrid can be employed in realistic problems with
snapshots from 3D radiative-MHD simulations as input atmospheres. With
multigrid, we obtain a factor 3.3-4.5 speedup compared to MALI. With
full-multigrid the speed-up increases to a factor 6. The speedup is expected to
increase for input atmospheres with more grid points and finer grid spacing.
Solving 3D non-LTE radiative transfer problems using non-linear multigrid
methods can be applied to realistic atmospheres with a substantial speed-up.

conditioned multi-Gaussian realizations and derivatives thereof can explain the

is presented using the observations recorded with the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrometer (IRIS), the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on-board Hinode and the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The fan loops emerging
from non-flaring AR~11899 (near the disk-center) on 19th November, 2013 are
clearly discernible in AIA 171~{\AA} images and those obtained in \ion{Fe}{8}
and \ion{Si}{7} images using EIS. Our measurements of electron densities reveal
that the footpoints of these loops are approximately at constant pressure with
electron densities of $\log\,N_{e}=$ 10.1 cm$^{-3}$ at $\log\,[T/K]=5.15$
(\ion{O}{4}), and $\log\,N_{e}=$ 8.9 cm$^{-3}$ at $\log\,[T/K]=6.15$
(\ion{Si}{10}). The electron temperature diagnosed across the fan loops by
means of EM-Loci suggest that at the footpoints, there are two temperature
components at $\log\,[T/K]=4.95$ and 5.95, which are picked-up by IRIS lines
and EIS lines respectively. At higher heights, the loops are nearly isothermal
at $\log\,[T/K]=5.95$, that remained constant along the loop. The measurement
of Doppler shift using IRIS lines suggests that the plasma at the footpoints of
these loops is predominantly redshifted by 2-3~km~s$^{-1}$ in \ion{C}{2},
10-15~km~s$^{-1}$ in \ion{Si}{4} and $~$15{--}20~km~s$^{-1}$ in \ion{O}{4},
reflecting the increase in the speed of downflows with increasing temperature
from $\log\,[T/K]=4.40$ to 5.15. These observations can be explained by low
frequency nanoflares or impulsive heating, and provide further important
constraints on the modeling of the dynamics of fan loops.

Whereas at $y=0.11$ even a sensitive magnetic microprobe such as $\mu$SR does
not detect magnetism, all other samples display weak ferromagnetism with a
magnetic moment of up to 0.22 $\mu_B$ per Fe atom. As a function of doping and
of temperature a crossover from short range to long range magnetic order is
observed, characterized by a broadly distributed spontaneous internal field.
However, the $y=0.14$ and $y=0.17$ remain in the short range ordered state down
to the lowest investigated temperature. The transition from short range to long
range order appears to be accompanied by a change of the character of the spin
fluctuations, which exhibit spin wave excitations signature in the LRO part of
the phase diagram. M\""ossbauer spectroscopy for $y=0.27$ and 0.32 indicates
that the internal field lies in the plane perpendicular to the crystallographic
$c$ axis. The field distribution and its evolution with doping suggest that the
details of the Fe magnetic moment formation and the consequent magnetic state
are determined not only by the dopant concentration but also by the way the
replacement of the Ga atoms surrounding the Fe is accomplished.

observed in current observations, it is of great significance to find out the
influences of photospheric magnetic conditions on solar eruptive activities.
Previous studies about catastrophe indicated that the magnetic system
consisting of a flux rope in a partially open bipolar field is subject to
catastrophe, but not if the bipolar field is completely closed under the same
specified photospheric conditions. In order to investigate the influence of the
photospheric magnetic conditions on the catastrophic behavior of this system,
we expand upon the 2.5 dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in
Cartesian coordinates to simulate the evolution of the equilibrium states of
the system under different photospheric flux distributions. Our simulation
results reveal that a catastrophe occurs only when the photospheric flux is not
concentrated too much toward the polarity inversion line and the source regions
of the bipolar field are not too weak; otherwise no catastrophe occurs. As a
result, under certain photospheric conditions, a catastrophe could take place
in a completely closed configuration whereas it ceases to exist in a partially
open configuration. This indicates that whether the background field is
completely closed or partially open is not the only necessary condition for the
existence of catastrophe, and that the photospheric conditions also play a
crucial role in the catastrophic behavior of the flux rope system.

efficiently reduces the effect of inter-cell interference from other-cell base

streams in the same cell. We show that the minimum number of users required to
achieve a target degrees-of-freedom (DoF) can be fundamentally reduced, i.e.,
the fundamental user scaling law can be improved by using the ODIA, compared
with the existing downlink IA schemes. In addition, we adopt a limited feedback
strategy in the ODIA framework, and then analyze the number of feedback bits
required for the system with limited feedback to achieve the same user scaling
law of the ODIA as the system with perfect CSI. We also modify the original
ODIA in order to further improve sum-rate, which achieves the optimal multiuser
diversity gain, i.e., $\log\log N$, per spatial stream even in the presence of
downlink inter-cell interference, where $N$ denotes the number of users in a
cell. Simulation results show that the ODIA significantly outperforms existing
interference management techniques in terms of sum-rate in realistic cellular
environments. Note that the ODIA operates in a non-collaborative and decoupled
manner, i.e., it requires no information exchange among BSs and no iterative
beamformer optimization between BSs and users, thus leading to an easier
implementation.

of geophysical data that is based on structural constraints is often favored
over model coupling based on explicit petrophysical relationships. More
specifically, cross-gradient joint inversion has been applied to a wide range

physical consistency. Future research avenues include investigating the

This density range covers the rock densities of new and previously published

High-density anomalies in the central and southern part of the island can be
related to two main degassing faults crossing the island (N41 and N64) that are
interpreted as preferential regions of dyke intrusions. In addition, two
low-density anomalies are found in the northeastern part and in the summit area
of the island. These anomalies seem to be geographically related with past

sampling from past states, MT-DREAM(ZS) is being used to infer, as closely and
consistently as possible, the posterior distribution of spatially distributed
vadose zone soil moisture and/or porosity under saturated conditions. Two
differing and opposing model parameterization schemes are being considered, one
involving a classical uniform grid discretization and the other based on a
discrete cosine transformation (DCT). We illustrate our approach using two
different case studies involving geophysical data from a synthetic water tracer
infiltration study and a real-world field study under saturated conditions. Our
results demonstrate that the DCT parameterization yields the most accurate
estimates of distributed soil moisture for a large range of spatial
resolutions, and superior MCMC convergence rates. In addition, DCT is admirably
suited to investigate and quantify the effects of model truncation errors on
the MT-DREAM(ZS) inversion results. For the field example, lateral anisotropy
needs to be enforced to derive reliable soil moisture variability. Our results
also demonstrate that the posterior soil moisture uncertainty derived with the
proposed Bayesian procedure is significantly larger than its counterpart
estimated from classical smoothness-constrained deterministic inversions.

the crucial link between the expected values of diffusion processes and the

been shown to capture nonlinear mean square displacements exhibiting crossovers
between different scaling regimes, which have been observed in biological

its extension to functionals explicitly depending on time, which are relevant

staggering growth accompanied by intense debates and scattered regulations
around the world. Current discourses, however, are largely focused on opinions
rather than empirical evidences. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting
the first large-scale measurement study on Airbnb, using a crawled data set
containing 2.3 million listings, 1.3 million hosts, and 19.3 million reviews.
We measure several key characteristics at the heart of the ongoing debate and
the sharing economy. Among others, we find that Airbnb has reached a global yet
heterogeneous coverage. The majority of its listings across many countries are
entire homes, suggesting that Airbnb is actually more like a rental marketplace
rather than a spare-room sharing platform. Analysis on star-ratings reveals
that there is a bias toward positive ratings, amplified by a bias toward using
positive words in reviews. The extent of such bias is greater than Yelp
reviews, which were already shown to exhibit a positive bias. We investigate a
key issue---commercial hosts who own multiple listings on Airbnb---repeatedly
discussed in the current debate. We find that their existence is prevalent,
they are early-movers towards joining Airbnb, and their listings are
disproportionately entire homes and located in the US. Our work advances the
current understanding of how Airbnb is being used and may serve as an
independent and empirical reference to inform the debate.

media treated by the plasma jet capable of forming thinly stratified
self-organized patterns at a plasma-liquid interface. A pronounced cancer
depressing activity towards at least two kinds of human cancer cells, namely
breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and human glioblastoma U87 cancer lines, was
demonstrated. After a short treatment at the thinly stratified self-organized
plasma-liquid interface pattern, the cancer inhibiting media demonstrate well
pronounced depression and apoptosis activities towards tumor cells, not
achievable without interfacial stratification of plasma jet to thin (of several
um) current filaments, which therefore play a pivotal (yet still not completely
clear) role in building up the cancer inhibition properties. Moreover, thinly
stratified, self-organized interfacial discharge is capable to efficiently
control the ROS and RNS concentrations in the cancer-inhibiting media, and in
particular, abnormal ROS/RNS ratios not achievable in discharges which do not
form stratified thin-filament patterns could be obtained. These results were
explained in terms of interaction of thin plasma filaments of the
self-organized pattern with gas and liquid, where the unusual interaction
conditions (i.e., high surface-to-volume ratios etc.) cause accumulation of
ROS, RNS and other species in unusual ratios and concentrations, thus forming
potentially efficient anti-cancer cocktail. Our funding could be extremely

process provides a non-standard coupling of all finite Kingman's coalescents.
Second, we use the new process and the Chen-Stein method to extend the
well-understood properties of degree distribution of random recursive trees to
extremal-range cases. Namely, we obtain convergence rates on the number of
vertices with degree at least $c\ln n$, $c\in (1,2)$, in trees with $n$
vertices. Further avenues of research are discussed.

applied to multirobot excavation for lunar base preparation tasks including
clearing landing pads and burying of habitat modules. We show for the first
time, a team of autonomous robots excavating a terrain to match a given 3D
blueprint. Constructing mounds around landing pads will provide physical
shielding from debris during launch/landing. Burying a human habitat modules
under 0.5 m of lunar regolith is expected to provide both radiation shielding
and maintain temperatures of -25 $^{o}$C. This minimizes base life-support
complexity and reduces launch mass. ANT is compelling for a lunar mission
because it doesn't require a team of astronauts for excavation and it requires
minimal supervision. The robot teams are shown to autonomously interpret
blueprints, excavate and prepare sites for a lunar base. Because little
pre-programmed knowledge is provided, the controllers discover creative
techniques. ANT evolves techniques such as slot-dozing that would otherwise
require excavation experts. This is critical in making an excavation mission
feasible when it is prohibitively expensive to send astronauts. The controllers
evolve elaborate negotiation behaviors to work in close quarters. These and
other techniques such as concurrent evolution of the controller and team size
are shown to tackle problem of antagonism, when too many robots interfere
reducing the overall efficiency or worse, resulting in gridlock. While many
challenges remain with this technology our work shows a compelling pathway for
field testing this approach.

characterization of large and complex biomolecular systems by simulation rely
on ensemble approaches, where data from large numbers of relatively short
trajectories are integrated. In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are
extremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and
long-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these
short simulations are in ""local equilibrium"" within the MSM states. However, in
the last over 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially
discussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can
be detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM
estimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these
issues: We systematically analyze the estimation of Markov state models (MSMs)
from short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the
error between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from
many short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained
even from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag
times and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model
(OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that
corrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag
times are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate
the exact eigenvalues or relaxation timescales of the system without estimating
an MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the
discretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular
dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration.
The improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA as of version 2.3.

of the pathology in unseen individuals. Nonetheless, the use of disease
progression models for probabilistic predictions still requires investigation,
for example for accounting for missing observations in clinical data, and for
accurate uncertainty quantification. We tackle this problem by proposing a
novel Gaussian process-based method for the joint modeling of imaging and
clinical biomarker progressions from time series of individual observations.
The model is formulated to account for individual random effects and time
reparameterization, allowing non-parametric estimates of the biomarker
evolution, as well as high flexibility in specifying correlation structure, and
time transformation models. Thanks to the Bayesian formulation, the model
naturally accounts for missing data, and allows for uncertainty quantification
in the estimate of evolutions, as well as for probabilistic prediction of
disease staging in unseen patients. The experimental results show that the
proposed model provides a biologically plausible description of the evolution
of Alzheimer's pathology across the whole disease time-span as well as
remarkable predictive performance when tested on a large clinical cohort with
missing observations.

which consumers who adopt the product can later ""recover"" and stop influencing
their peers to adopt the product. To gain insight into the effect of the social
network structure on the diffusion, we focus on two extreme cases. In the
""most-connected"" configuration where all consumers are inter-connected
(complete network), averaging over all consumers leads to an aggregate model,
which combines the Bass model for diffusion of new products with the SIR model
for epidemics. In the ""least-connected"" configuration where consumers are
arranged on a circle and each consumer can only be influenced by his left
neighbor (one-sided 1D network), averaging over all consumers leads to a
different aggregate model which is linear, and can be solved explicitly. We
conjecture that for any other network, the diffusion is bounded from below and
from above by that on a one-sided 1D network and on a complete network,
respectively. When consumers are arranged on a circle and each consumer can be
influenced by his left and right neighbors (two-sided 1D network), the
diffusion is strictly faster than on a one-sided 1D network. This is different
from the case of non-recovering adopters, where the diffusion on one-sided and
on two-sided 1D networks is identical. We also propose a nonlinear model for
recoveries, and show that consumers' heterogeneity has a negligible effect on
the aggregate diffusion.

from level-dependent random samples of the high-dimensional parameter space via
CS methods such as weighted l1-minimization. For affine parametric, linear

certain summability properties of the coefficient sequence in a general

vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Coherent VUV
laser radiation is produced by resonance-enhanced sum-frequency mixing
($\nu_{\mathrm{VUV}}=2\nu_{\mathrm{UV}}+\nu_2$) in Kr and Xe using two
near-Fourier-transform-limited laser pulses of frequencies $\nu_{\mathrm{UV}}$
and $\nu_2$. Sidebands generated in the output of the second laser ($\nu_2$)
using an electro-optical modulator operating at the frequency
$\nu_{\mathrm{mod}}$ are directly transfered to the VUV and used to record FM
spectra. Demodulation is demonstrated both at $\nu_{\mathrm{mod}}$ and
$2\nu_{\mathrm{mod}}$. The main advantages of the method are that its
sensitivity is not reduced by pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the VUV laser
intensity, compared to VUV absorption spectroscopy is its background-free
nature, the fact that its implementation using table-top laser equipment is
straightforward and that it can be used to record VUV absorption spectra of
cold samples in skimmed supersonic beams simultaneously with
laser-induced-fluorescence and photoionization spectra. To illustrate these
advantages we present VUV FM spectra of Ar, Kr, and N$_2$ in selected regions
between 105000cm$^{-1}$ and 122000cm$^{-1}$.

to study the quantum-to-classical transition and the impact of noise on
entanglement during inflation. Given an explicit interaction between the system
and environment, we derive a quantum master equation for the reduced density
matrix of perturbations, drawing parallels with quantum Brownian motion, where
we see the emergence of fluctuation and dissipation terms. Although the master
equation is not in Lindblad form, we see how typical solutions exhibit
positivity on super-horizon scales, leading to a physically meaningful density
matrix. This allows us to write down a Langevin equation with stochastic noise
for the classical trajectories which emerge from the quantum system on
super-horizon scales. In particular, we find that environmental decoherence
increases in strength as modes exit the horizon, with the growth driven
essentially by white noise coming from local contribution to environmental
correlations. Finally, we use our master equation to quantify the strength of
quantum correlations as captured by discord. We show that environmental
interactions have a tendency to decrease the size of the discord and that these
effects are determined by the relative strength of the expansion rate and
interaction rate of the environment. We interpret this in terms of the
competing effects of particle creation versus environmental fluctuations, which
tend to increase and decrease the discord respectively.

behaviors that the brain generates. But the brain, an extremely complex
structure resulting from millions of years of evolution, can be viewed as a
solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. The
environment generates signals that produce sensory events within an organism.
Building an internal spatial and temporal model of the environment allows an
organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. Higher intelligence might
be the ability to process information coming from a larger extent of
space-time. In keeping with nature's penchant for extending rather than
replacing, the purpose of the mammalian neocortex might then be to record
events from distant reaches of space and time and render them, as though yet
near and present, to the older, deeper brain whose instinctual roles have
changed little over eons. Here this notion is embodied in a model called
morphognosis (morpho = shape and gnosis = knowledge). Its basic structure is a
pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of the pyramid
are the most recent and nearby events. Receding from the apex are less recent
and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a
structure of progressively larger chunks of space-time knowledge. A set of
morphognostics forms long-term memories that are learned by exposure to the
environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the
morphognosis model, using a simulated organism that learns to forage in its
world for food, build a nest, and play the game of Pong.

Although many
experimental studies make it clear that viruses are parasitic entities that
hijack the host's molecular resources, a detailed estimate for the energetic
cost of viral synthesis is largely lacking. To quantify the energetic cost of
viruses to their hosts, we enumerated the costs associated with two very
distinct but representative DNA and RNA viruses, namely T4 and influenza. We
found that for these viruses, translation of viral proteins is the most
energetically expensive process. Interestingly, the cost of building a T4 phage
and a single influenza virus are nearly the same. Due to influenza's higher
burst size, however, the overall cost of a T4 phage infection is only 2-3% of
the cost of an influenza infection. The costs of these infections relative to
their host's estimated energy budget during the infection reveal that a T4
infection consumes about a third of its host's energy budget, where as an
influenza infection consumes only 1%. Building on our estimates for T4, we show
how the energetic costs of double-stranded DNA viruses scale with virus size,
revealing that the dominant cost of building a virus can switch from
translation to genome replication above a critical virus size. Lastly, using
our predictions for the energetic cost of viruses, we provide estimates for the
strengths of selection and genetic drift acting on newly incorporated genetic
elements in viral genomes, under conditions of energy limitation.

applications, including pricing claims with path dependence and early exercise
features, stochastic optimal control, filtering problems and efficient
calibration of large derivative books. Recursive Marginal Quantization of the
Euler scheme has recently been proposed as an efficient numerical method for
evaluating functionals of solutions of stochastic differential equations. This
method involves recursively quantizing the conditional marginals of the
discrete-time Euler approximation of the underlying process. By generalizing
this approach, we show that it is possible to perform recursive marginal
quantization for two higher-order schemes: the Milstein scheme and a simplified
weak order 2.0 scheme. As part of this generalization a simple matrix
formulation is presented, allowing efficient implementation. We further extend
the applicability of recursive marginal quantization by showing how absorption
and reflection at the zero boundary may be incorporated, when this is
necessary. To illustrate the improved accuracy of the higher order schemes,
various computations are performed using geometric Brownian motion and its
generalization, the constant elasticity of variance model. For both processes,
we show numerical evidence of improved weak order convergence and we compare
the marginal distributions implied by the three schemes to the known analytical
distributions. By pricing European, Bermudan and Barrier options, further
evidence of improved accuracy of the higher order schemes is demonstrated.

of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low
permeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock
sample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock
sample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high
permeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional
steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability
as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny
mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of
targeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops,
sectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known
permeability of the reference rock sample, based on the mass conservation
principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using
additional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop across
the first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to
high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to
form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the
measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in
studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently,
the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high
accuracy and efficiency.

  Linguistic Society of America, Poster (January 5-8, 2017)",,,,"stat.AP stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mixed-effects models have emerged as the gold standard of statistical
analysis in different sub-fields of linguistics (Baayen, Davidson & Bates,
2008; Johnson, 2009; Barr, et al, 2013; Gries, 2015). One problematic feature
of these models is their failure to converge under maximal (or even
near-maximal) random effects structures. The lack of convergence is relatively
unaddressed in linguistics and when it is addressed has resulted in statistical
practices (e.g. Jaeger, 2009; Gries, 2015; Bates, et al, 2015b) that are
premised on the idea that non-convergence is an indication that a random
effects structure is over-specified (or not parsimonious), the parsimonious
convergence hypothesis (PCH). We test the PCH by running simulations in lme4
under two sets of assumptions for both a linear dependent variable and a binary
dependent variable in order to assess the rate of non-convergence for both
types of mixed effects models when a known maximal effect structure is used to
generate the data (i.e. when non-convergence cannot be explained by random
effects with zero variance). Under the PCH, lack of convergence is treated as
evidence against a more maximal random effects structure, but that result is
not upheld with our simulations. We provide an alternative model, fully
specified Bayesian models implemented in rstan (Stan Development Team, 2016;
Carpenter, et al, in press) that removed the convergence problems almost
entirely in simulations of the same conditions. These results indicate that
when there is known non-zero variance for all slopes and intercepts, under
realistic distributions of data and with moderate to severe imbalance, mixed
effects models in lme4 have moderate to high non-convergence rates which can
cause linguistic researchers to wrongfully exclude random effect terms.
