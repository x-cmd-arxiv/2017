integration and interoperability of networking, computing systems, and
mechanical devices. Due to its scale and variety, CPS faces a number of
challenges and opens up a few research questions in terms of management,
fault-tolerance, and scalability. We propose a software-defined approach
inspired by Software-Defined Networking (SDN), to address the challenges for a
wider CPS adoption. We thus design a middleware architecture for the correct
and resilient operation of CPS, to manage and coordinate the interacting
devices centrally in the cyberspace whilst not sacrificing the functionality
and performance benefits inherent to a distributed execution.

considered. Digraph games are transferable utility (TU) games with limited
cooperation among players, where players are represented by nodes. A
restrictive relation between two adjacent players is established by a directed
line segment. Directed path, connecting the initial player with the terminal
player, form the coalition among players. A dominance relation is established
between players and this relation determines whether or not a player wants to
cooperate. To cooperate, we assume that a player joins a coalition where he/she
is not dominated by any other players.The Shapley value is defined as the
average of marginal contribution vectors corresponding to all permutations that
do not violate the subordination of players. The Shapley value for cyclic
digraph games is calculated and analyzed. For a given family of characteristic
functions, a quick way to calculate Shapley values is formulated.

be dissipated as heat, potentially raising the temperature 20 C - 30 C higher
than the ambient. In the long term, extreme self-heating erodes efficiency and
shortens lifetime, thereby dramatically reducing the total energy output.
Therefore, it is critically important to develop effective and practical (and
preferably passive) cooling methods to reduce operating temperature of PV
modules. In this paper, we explore two fundamental (but often overlooked)
origins of PV self-heating, namely, sub-bandgap absorption and imperfect
thermal radiation. The analysis suggests that we redesign the optical
properties of the solar module to eliminate parasitic absorption
(selective-spectral cooling) and enhance thermal emission (radiative cooling).
Our Comprehensive opto-electro-thermal simulation shows that the proposed
techniques would cool the one-sun and low-concentrated terrestrial solar
modules up to 10 C and 20 C, respectively. This self-cooling would
substantially extend the lifetime for solar modules, with The corresponding
increase in energy yields and reduced LCOE.

consists of a quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra $(\frak{q},\beta)$ together with a

$\frak{g}$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebras are the Lie algebra structures
associated to symplectic Lie groups with an action by a Lie group $G$ which
acts via symplectic Lie group automorphisms. In addition to geometry,
$\frak{g}$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebras can also be motivated from the point of

correspond to \textit{quasi Frobenius Lie objects} in $\mathbf{Rep}(\frak{g})$.
If $\frak{g}$ is now equipped with a Lie bialgebra structure, then the
categorical formulation of $\overline{G}$-Frobenius algebras given in \cite{KP}

quasi-Frobenius Lie object in $\mathbf{Rep}(D(\frak{g}))$, where $D(\frak{g})$

the magnetostatic interaction is biaxial, with hard axis normal to the ribbon
and easy axis along the central curve. The micromagnetic energy of a narrow
ribbon reduces to that of a one-dimensional ferromagnetic wire, but with
curvature, torsion and local anisotropy modified by the rate of turning. These
general results are applied to two examples, namely a helicoid ribbon, for
which the central curve is a straight line, and a M\""obius ribbon, for which
the central curve is a circle about which the line segment executes a
$180^\circ$ twist. In both examples, for large positive tangential anisotropy,
the ground state magnetization lies tangent to the central curve. As the
tangential anisotropy is decreased, the ground state magnetization undergoes a
transition, acquiring an in-surface component perpendicular to the central
curve. For the helicoid ribbon, the transition occurs at vanishing anisotropy,
below which the ground state is uniformly perpendicular to the central curve.
The transition for the M\""obius ribbon is more subtle; it occurs at a positive

to be combined by an additional beamsplitter. In this scheme, signals at the

The influence of the position meter-like back action force associated with the

amplitude quadrature of the beamsplitter common output correlated with this

modern gravitational-wave detectors, two independent optical position meters
can be implemented by two orthogonal polarisations of the probe light. Our

due to H ii-regions. These differences, together with the biconic symmetry of
the extra-planar ionized structure, makes UGC 10043 a clear candidate for a
galaxy with gas outflows ionizated by shocks. From the comparison of shock
models with the observed line ratios, and the kinematics observed from the FPI
data, we constrain the physical properties of the observed outflow. The data
are compatible with a velocity increase of the gas along the extraplanar
distances up to < 400 km/s and the preshock density decreasing in the same
direction. We also observe a discrepancy in the SFR estimated based on Ha (0.36
Msun/yr ) and the estimated with the CIGALE code, being the latter 5 times
larger. Nevertheless, this SFR is still not enough to drive the observed
galactic wind if we do not take into account the filling factor. We stress that
the combination of the three techniques of observation with models is a
powerful tool to explore galactic winds in the Local Universe.

formation for moving interface problems involving the incompressible Euler
equations in the plane.
  The first problem considered is the two-phase Euler vortex sheets problem
with surface tension for which is proved the finite time singularity of the
natural norm of the problem for suitable initial data. This is in striking
contrast with the case of finite time splash and splat singularity formation
for the one phase Euler equations introduced in [4] and studied in a more
general context in [8], for which the natural norm (in the one phase fluid)
stays finite all the way until contact.
  The second problem considered involves the presence of a heavier rigid body
moving in the perfect fluid. We first establish that the rigid body will hit
the bottom of the fluid domain in finite time (in a more general context and
very different methodology than first done for this problem in [19]). We next
establish that a surface energy blows up, and characterize the acceleration of
the rigid body at contact, depending on the nature of the contact zone:
Acceleration opposes the motion at contact, and is either positive finite if
the contact zone contains a curve, or infinite otherwise.

relative to the matter. We show how measurements of this spatial distribution

inferences about the physics of halo formation. Our analysis exploits the fact
that halo bias factors satisfy consistency relations which encode this physics,

assembly bias has played a role. We illustrate our methods using a model in
which three parameters matter: a density threshold, the local slope and the
curvature of the smoothed density field. The latter two are nearly degenerate;
our approach naturally allows one to build an accurate effective two-parameter
model for which the consistency relations still apply. This, with an accurate
description of the smoothing window, allows one to describe the
protohalo-matter cross-correlation very well, both in Fourier and configuration
space. We then use our determination of the large scale bias parameters
together with the consistency relations, to estimate the enclosed density and
mean slope on the Lagrangian radius scale of the protohalos. Direct
measurements of these quantities, made on smaller scales than those on which
the bias parameters are typically measured, are in good agreement.

assigned to underlying physical resources in a network substrate. VN migration
is the process of remapping a VN's logical topology to a new set of physical
resources to provide failure recovery, energy savings, or defense against
attack. Providing VN migration that is transparent to running applications is a
significant challenge. Efficient migration mechanisms are highly dependent on
the technology deployed in the physical substrate. Prior work has considered
migration in data centers and in the PlanetLab infrastructure. However, there
has been little effort targeting an SDN-enabled wide-area networking
environment - an important building block of future networking infrastructure.
In this work, we are interested in the design, implementation and evaluation of
VN migration in GENI as a working example of such a future network. We identify
and propose techniques to address key challenges: the dynamic allocation of
resources during migration, managing hosts connected to the VN, and flow table
migration sequences to minimize packet loss. We find that GENI's virtualization
architecture makes transparent and efficient migration challenging. We suggest
alternatives that might be adopted in GENI and are worthy of adoption by

system's energy cannot be lowered by any reversible, unitary process acting on

concept of complete passivity, thermal states, and the emergence of a
thermodynamic temperature. In contrast, here we need only consider a single
system and show that every passive state except the thermal state is unstable
under a weaker form of reversibility. More precisely, we show that given a
single copy of any athermal quantum state we may extract a maximal amount of
energy from the state when we can use a machine that operates in a reversible
cycle and whose state is left unchanged. This means that for individual systems
the only form of passivity that is stable under general reversible processes is
complete passivity, and thus provides a single-shot and more physically
motivated identification of thermal states and the emergence of temperature.
The machine which extracts work from passive states exploits the fact that one
can find a subspace which acts as a virtual hot reservoir, and a subspace which
acts as a virtual cold reservoir. We show that an optimal amount of work can be
extracted, and that the machine operates at the Carnot efficiency between pairs
of virtual reservoirs.

equation with the help of the eigenfunctions of the time-dependent
Fokker-Planck operator. The expansion parameter is the time derivative of the
external parameter which controls the form of an external potential. Our
expansion corresponds to the perturbative calculation of the adiabatic motion
in quantum mechanics. With this method, we derive a new formula to calculate
the irreversible work order by order, which is expressed as the expectation
value with a pseudo density matrix. Applying this method to the case of the
harmonic potential, we show that the first order term of the expansion gives
the exact result. Because we do not need to solve the coupled differential
equations of moments, our method simplifies the calculations of various
functions such as the fluctuation of the irreversible work per unit time. We
further investigate the exact optimized protocol to minimize the irreversible
work by calculating its variation with respect to the control parameter itself.

while the outer envelope of proto-Jupiter is typically convective and has an
homogeneous composition, the innermost regions have compositional gradients. In
addition, the existence of heavy elements in the envelope leads to much higher
internal temperatures (several times 10$^4$ K) than in the case of a
hydrogen-helium envelope. The derived core mass depends on the actual
definition of the core: if the core is defined as the region in which the
heavy-element mass fraction is above some limit (say 0.5), then it can be much
more massive ($\sim$ 15 M$_{\oplus}$) and more extended (10\% of the planet's

diagnostic tool to characterize the system's formation and evolution. This tool
is however complex to use in practice, as galaxies are subject to a range of
simultaneous physical processes active from pc to kpc scales. This renders
observations of the full optical extent of galaxies down to sub-kpc scales
essential. Aims. Using the WiFeS integral field spectrograph, we previously
detected abrupt and localized variations in the gas-phase oxygen abundance of
the spiral galaxy HCG91c. Here, we follow-up on these observations to map
HCG91c's disk out to ~2Re at a resolution of 600pc, and characterize the
non-radial variations of the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the system. Methods.
We obtained deep MUSE observations of the target under ~0.6 arcsec seeing
conditions. We perform both a spaxel-based and aperture-based analysis of the
data to map the spatial variations of 12+log(O/H) across the disk of the
galaxy. Results. We confirm the presence of rapid variations of the oxygen
abundance across the entire extent of the galaxy previously detected with
WiFeS, for all azimuths and radii. The variations can be separated in two
categories: a) localized and associated with individual HII regions, and b)
extended over kpc scales, and occurring at the boundaries of the spiral
structures in the galaxy. Conclusions. Our MUSE observations suggest that the
enrichment of the interstellar medium in HGC91c has proceeded preferentially
along spiral structures, and less efficiently across them. Our dataset
highlights the importance of distinguishing individual star-forming regions
down to scales of a few 100pc when using integral field spectrographs to
spatially resolve the distribution of oxygen abundances in a given system, and
accurately characterize azimuthal variations and intrinsic scatter.

host dark matter subhaloes, the most massive of which may have undergone star
formation resulting in dwarf galaxy groups. Ensembles of dwarf galaxies are
observed as satellites of more massive galaxies, and there is observational and
theoretical evidence to suggest that these satellites at z=0 were captured by
the massive host halo as a group. However, the evolution of dwarf galaxies is
highly susceptible to environment making these satellite groups imperfect
probes of CDM in the low mass regime. We have identified one of the clearest
examples to date of hierarchical structure formation at low masses: seven
isolated, spectroscopically confirmed groups with only dwarf galaxies as
members. Each group hosts 3-5 known members, has a baryonic mass of ~4.4 x 10^9

residuals with S\'ersic index could be ascribed to the (weak) correlation with
bulge mass or even velocity dispersion. Finally, targetted Monte Carlo

orbits of a few days. They are commonly believed not to have formed in situ,
requiring inwards migration towards the host star. One of the proposed
migration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in
which the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular
processes, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous
theoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.
Recently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the
latter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and
HJs could potentially be formed more efficiently. Here, we investigate this
possibility by modeling the secular dynamical and tidal evolution of planets in
two hierarchical configurations in stellar triple systems. We find that the HJ
formation efficiency is higher compared to stellar binaries, but only by at
most a few tens of per cent. The orbital properties of the HJs formed in the
simulations are very similar to HJs formed in stellar binaries, and similarly
to studies of the latter we find no significant number of warm Jupiters. HJs
are only formed in our simulations for triples with specific orbital
configurations, and our constraints are approximately consistent with current
observations. In future, this allows to rule out high-$e$ migration in stellar
triples if a HJ is detected in a triple grossly violating these constraints.

microbes in a bid to gain insight into transcriptional regulation, adaptive

enabling rational strain design. Unfortunately, experimentally determined
intracellular flux distribution are often inconsistent or incomparable due to
different experimental conditions and methodologies. Computational strain
design relies on constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA)
techniques to predict the effect of gene knockouts such as flux balance
analysis (FBA), regulatory on/off minimization(ROOM), minimization of metabolic
adjustment (MOMA), relative optimality in metabolic networks (RELATCH). Most of
these knock-out prediction methods are based on conserving inherent flux
patterns (between wild type and mutant) that are thought to be representative
of the cellular regulatory structure. However, it has been recently
demonstrated that these methods show poor agreement with experimental data. To
improve the fidelity of knockout predictions and subsequent computational
strain design, we developed REMEP, a metabolite-centric method. We demonstrate
the improved performance of REMEP by comparing the different methods on
experimental knockout data of E. coli, and S. cerevisiae grown in batch
cultures. REMEP retains most of the features of earlier algorithms but is much
more accurate in capturing cellular responses to genetic perturbations. A
primary reason for this is that REMEP relies on the assumption that cellular
regulatory structure leaves a signature on metabolite patterns and not just
flux patterns. REMEP will also prove useful in uncovering novel insights into
cellular regulation and control.

epithelial-looking cells with enhanced migratory ability during embryonic
development and tissue repair. EMT can also be co-opted by cancer cells to
acquire metastatic potential and drug-resistance. Recent research has argued
that epithelial (E) cells can undergo either a partial EMT to attain a hybrid
epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that typically displays collective
migration, or a complete EMT to adopt a mesenchymal (M) phenotype that shows
individual migration. The core EMT regulatory network -
miR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 - has been identified by various studies, but how
this network regulates the transitions among the E, E/M, and M phenotypes
remains controversial. Two major mathematical models - ternary chimera switch
(TCS) and cascading bistable switches (CBS) - that both focus on the
miR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 network, have been proposed to elucidate the EMT
dynamics, but a detailed analysis of how well either or both of these two
models can capture recent experimental observations about EMT dynamics remains
to be done. Results: Here, via an integrated experimental and theoretical
approach, we first show that both these two models can be used to understand
the two-step transition of EMT - E-E/M-M, the different responses of SNAIL and
ZEB1 to exogenous TGF-b and the irreversibility of complete EMT. Next, we
present new experimental results that tend to discriminate between these two
models. We show that ZEB1 is present at intermediate levels in the hybrid E/M
H1975 cells, and that in HMLE cells, overexpression of SNAIL is not sufficient
to initiate EMT in the absence of ZEB1 and FOXC2. Conclusions: These
experimental results argue in favor of the TCS model proposing that
miR-200/ZEB1 behaves as a three-way decision-making switch enabling transitions
among the E, hybrid E/M and M phenotypes.

Symmetry where the fermion mixings arise as result of imposing an ${\bf

As a consequence, the effective neutrino mass matrix possesses approximately
the $\mu-\tau$ symmetry. The breaking of the $\mu-\tau$ symmetry induces
sizable non zero $\theta_{13}$, and the deviation of $\theta_{23}$ from
$45^{\circ}$ is strongly controlled by an $\epsilon$ free parameter and the
complex neutrino masses. Then, an analytic study on the extreme Majorana phases
is done since these turn out to be relevant to enhance or suppress the reactor
and atmospheric angle. So that we have constrained the parameter space for the
$\epsilon$ parameter and the lightest neutrino mass that accommodate the mixing
angles. The highlighted results are: a) the normal hierarchy is ruled out since
the reactor angle comes out being tiny, for any values of the Majorana phases;
b) for the inverted hierarchy there is one combination in the extreme phases
where the values of the reactor and atmospheric angles are compatible up to $2,
3~\sigma$ of C. L., but the parameter space is tight; c) the model favors the
degenerate ordering for one combination in the extreme Majorana phases. In this
case, the reactor and atmospheric angle are compatible with the experimental
data for a large set of values of the free parameters. Therefore, this model
may be testable by the future result that the Nova and KamLAND-Zen
collaborations will provide.

sensitivity of the reconstructed images by orders of magnitude. The efficient
processing of large-scale data sets is of great importance. We propose an
acceleration strategy for a recently proposed primal-dual distributed
algorithm. A preconditioning approach can incorporate into the algorithmic
structure both the sampling density of the measured visibilities and the noise
statistics. Using the sampling density information greatly accelerates the
convergence speed, especially for highly non-uniform sampling patterns, while
relying on the correct noise statistics optimises the sensitivity of the
reconstruction. In connection to CLEAN, our approach can be seen as including
in the same algorithmic structure both natural and uniform weighting, thereby
simultaneously optimising both the resolution and the sensitivity. The method
relies on a new non-Euclidean proximity operator for the data fidelity term,
that generalises the projection onto the $\ell_2$ ball where the noise lives
for naturally weighted data, to the projection onto a generalised ellipsoid
incorporating sampling density information through uniform weighting.
Importantly, this non-Euclidean modification is only an acceleration strategy
to solve the convex imaging problem with data fidelity dictated only by noise
statistics. We showcase through simulations with realistic sampling patterns
the acceleration obtained using the preconditioning. We also investigate the
algorithm performance for the reconstruction of the 3C129 radio galaxy from
real visibilities and compare with multi-scale CLEAN, showing better
sensitivity and resolution. Our MATLAB code is available online on GitHub.

than those in isolation at the same stellar mass. At these stellar masses,
group central galaxies are usually found in small groups of N=2 members. The
higher HI content in these low mass group central galaxies is mirrored by their
higher average star formation activity and molecular hydrogen content. At
larger stellar masses, this difference disappears and central galaxies in
groups have similar (or even smaller) gas reservoirs and star formation
activity compared to those in isolation. We discuss possible scenarios able to

equivalent to either a pair of electron and ion flow flux tubes, a pair of

show that ion flow fields can unwind to compensate for an increasing magnetic
twist. The results demonstrate that including a species finite momentum can
result in a very long collimated canonical vorticity flux tube even if the
magnetic flux tube is flared. With finite momentum, particle density gradients
must be normal to canonical vorticities, not to magnetic fields, so
observations of collimated astrophysical jets could be images of canonical
vorticity flux tubes instead of magnetic flux tubes.

methods for verification and validation of quantum behavior. Quantum tomography
(QT) is the standard tool for diagnosing quantum states, process, and readout
devices by providing complete information. However, QT is limited since it is
expensive to not only implement experimentally, but also requires heavy
classical post-processing of data. In this dissertation, we introduce new
methods for QT that are more efficient to implement and robust to noise and
errors, thereby making QT a more practical tool for current quantum information
experiments.
  The crucial detail that makes these new, efficient, and robust methods
possible is prior information about the quantum system. This prior information
is prompted by the goals of most experiments in quantum information, which
require pure states, unitary processes, and rank-1 POVM operators. Therefore,
most experiments are designed to operate near this ideal regime. We show that
when this is the case, QT can be accomplished with significantly fewer
resources, and produce a robust estimate in the presence of noise and errors.
Moreover, the estimate is also robust if the state is not exactly pure, the
process is not exactly unitary, or the POVM is not exactly rank-1. Such
compelling methods are only made possible by the positivity constraint on
quantum states, processes, and POVMs. This requirement is an inherent feature
of quantum mechanics, but has powerful consequences to QT.
  Since QT is necessarily an experimental tool, we discuss a test of these new
methods in an experimental setting. The physical system is an ensemble of
laser-cooled cesium atoms in the laboratory of Prof. Poul Jessen. Experiments
were conducted by Hector Sosa-Martinez et al. to demonstrate different QT
protocols. We compare the results, and conclude that the new methods are
effective.

sub-components, which are seen to differ in structure. We determine core radii,
central temperatures, the gas masses within $r_{500c}$, and the total masses
for the broader NE and sharper SW components assuming hydrostatic equilibrium.
The central entropy of the NE clump is about two times higher than the SW.
Along with its structural properties, this suggests that it has undergone
merging on its own. The weak-lensing analysis gives virial masses for each
substructure, which compare well with earlier dynamical results. The derived
outer mass contours of the SW sub-component from weak lensing are more
irregular and extended than those of the NE. Although there is a weak
enhancement and small offsets between X-ray gas and mass centers from weak
lensing, the lack of large amounts of gas between the two sub-clusters
indicates that Abell 2465 is in a pre-merger state. A dynamical model that is
consistent with the observed cluster data, based on the FLASH program and the
radial infall model, is constructed, where the subclusters currently separated

provide solutions to problems, which can currently not be solved on classical
computers. Finding the best physical implementation for such technologies is an
important research topic and using optical effects is a promising route towards
this goal. It was theoretically shown that optical quantum computing is
possible using only single-photon sources and detectors, and linear optical
circuits. An experimental implementation of such quantum optical circuits
requires a stable, robust and scalable architecture. This can be achieved via
miniaturization of the optical devices in the form of photonic integrated
circuits (PICs). The development of a suitable material platform for such PICs
could therefore have a large impact on future technologies. Diamond is a
particularly attractive material here, as it naturally offers a range of
optically active defects, which can act as single-photon sources, quantum
memories, or sensor elements. Besides its excellent optical properties, diamond
also has a very high Young's modulus, which is important for optomechanics, and
can be employed for potentially fast and low-loss tuning of PICs after
fabrication. In this work, components for future quantum optical circuits are
developed. This includes the first diamond optomechanical elements, as well as
the first integrated single-photon detectors on a diamond material platform.
Diamond micromechanical resonators with high quality factors are realized and
their actuation via optical gradient forces and electrostatic forces is
demonstrated. The accomplished superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors
show excellent performance in terms of low timing jitter, high detection
efficiency, and low noise-equivalent power. Moreover, a novel scalable method
for PIC fabrication from high quality single crystal diamond is presented.

sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows for a
tractable computation of AIC (Akaike information criteria) or BIC (Bayes

information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling
the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support

place each candidate model in the {\em strong support}, {\em weak support} or

to a physical radius of $R=10.8\pm0.6$ km, and the neutron star would have to
be smaller than this radius (other outcomes are possible for allowed spin

used for the past 25 years as a reference source in TeV astronomy, for
calibration and verification of new TeV instruments. The High Altitude Water
Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), completed in early 2015, has been used to observe
the Crab Nebula at high significance across nearly the full spectrum of
energies to which HAWC is sensitive. HAWC is unique for its wide field-of-view,
nearly 2 sr at any instant, and its high-energy reach, up to 100 TeV. HAWC's
sensitivity improves with the gamma-ray energy. Above $\sim$1 TeV the
sensitivity is driven by the best background rejection and angular resolution
ever achieved for a wide-field ground array.
  We present a time-integrated analysis of the Crab using 507 live days of HAWC
data from 2014 November to 2016 June. The spectrum of the Crab is fit to a
function of the form $\phi(E) = \phi_0 (E/E_{0})^{-\alpha
-\beta\cdot{\rm{ln}}(E/E_{0})}$. The data is well-fit with values of
$\alpha=2.63\pm0.03$, $\beta=0.15\pm0.03$, and
log$_{10}(\phi_0~{\rm{cm}^2}~{\rm{s}}~{\rm{TeV}})=-12.60\pm0.02$ when $E_{0}$
is fixed at 7 TeV and the fit applies between 1 and 37 TeV. Study of the
systematic errors in this HAWC measurement is discussed and estimated to be
$\pm$50\% in the photon flux between 1 and 37 TeV.
  Confirmation of the Crab flux serves to establish the HAWC instrument's
sensitivity for surveys of the sky. The HAWC survey will exceed sensitivity of
current-generation observatories and open a new view of 2/3 of the sky above 10
TeV.

  In the first stage, we predict the location and scale of boxes which are
likely to contain people; for this we use the Faster RCNN detector. In the
second stage, we estimate the keypoints of the person potentially contained in
each proposed bounding box. For each keypoint type we predict dense heatmaps
and offsets using a fully convolutional ResNet. To combine these outputs we
introduce a novel aggregation procedure to obtain highly localized keypoint
predictions. We also use a novel form of keypoint-based Non-Maximum-Suppression
(NMS), instead of the cruder box-level NMS, and a novel form of keypoint-based
confidence score estimation, instead of box-level scoring.
  Trained on COCO data alone, our final system achieves average precision of
0.649 on the COCO test-dev set and the 0.643 test-standard sets, outperforming
the winner of the 2016 COCO keypoints challenge and other recent state-of-art.

were made using the same reference source, and data sets were of varying length
taken over the time period from September 1996 through August 2014. Clear
evidence of annual variations was observed in data from four of the detectors.
Short time periodograms from the data sets suggest temporal variability of both
the amplitude and frequency of these variations. The annual variations in two
of the data sets show peak values near the first of February, while
surprisingly, the annual variations in the other two are roughly out of phase
with the first two. Three of the four detectors exhibited annual variations
over approximately the same time period. A joint statistic constructed by
combining spectra from these three shows peaks approximating the frequencies of
solar r-mode oscillations with $\nu_R = 11.74$ cpy, $m=1$, and $l=3,5,6.$ The
fact that similar variations were not present in all detectors covering similar
time periods rules out variations in activity as the cause, and points to
differing sensitivities to unspecified environmental parameters instead. In
addition to seasonal variations, the modulation of environmental parameters by
solar processes remains a possible explanation of periodogram features, but
without requiring new physics.

slowly initially and then much more rapidly by ~ 10 Myr. However, there is a
continuing component until ~ 35 Myr, probably due primarily to massive clouds
of debris generated in giant impacts during the oligarchic/chaotic growth
phases of terrestrial planets. If the contribution from primordial disks is
excluded, the evolution of the incidence of these oligarchic/chaotic debris

(KS) star formation relation in the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)

from $10^{10}$ -- $10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the KS relation emerges
and is robustly maintained due to the effects of feedback on local scales
regulating star-forming gas, independent of the particular small-scale star
formation prescriptions employed. We demonstrate that the time-averaged KS
relation is relatively independent of redshift and spatial averaging scale, and
that the star formation rate surface density is weakly dependent on metallicity
and inversely dependent on orbital dynamical time. At constant star formation
rate surface density, the `Cold \& Dense' gas surface density (gas with $T <
300$~K and $n > 10$~cm$^{-3}$, used as a proxy for the molecular gas surface
density) of the simulated galaxies is $\sim$0.5~dex less than observed at
$\sim$kpc scales. This discrepancy may arise from underestimates of the local
column density at the particle-scale for the purposes of shielding in the
simulations. Finally, we show that on scales larger than individual giant
molecular clouds, the primary condition that determines whether star formation
occurs is whether a patch of the galactic disk is thermally Toomre-unstable
(not whether it is self-shielding): once a patch can no longer be thermally
stabilized against fragmentation, it collapses, becomes self-shielding, cools,

realize them in synthetic materials such as cold atomic gases. Intriguingly, it
is possible to realize Majorana boundary modes in a $1$D number-conserving
system consisting of two fermionic chains coupled only by pair-hopping
processes. It is commonly believed that significant interchain single-particle
tunneling necessarily destroys these Majorana modes, as it spoils the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermion parity symmetry that protects them. In this Letter, we
present a new mechanism to overcome this obstacle, by piercing a (synthetic)
magnetic $\pi$-flux through each plaquette of the Fermi ladder. Using
bosonization, we show that in this case there exists an exact leg-interchange
symmetry that is robust to interchain hopping, and acts as fermion parity at
long wavelengths. We utilize density matrix renormalization group and exact
diagonalization to verify that the resulting model exhibits Majorana boundary
modes up to large single-particle tunnelings, comparable to the intrachain
hopping strength. Our work highlights the unusual impacts of different
topologically trivial band structures on these interaction-driven topological
phases, and identifies a distinct route to stabilizing Majorana boundary modes
in $1$D fermionic ladders.

show that the superconductivity of $1T$-TiTe$_2$ exhibits very different
behavior under the hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure. The hydrostatic pressure
is harmful to the superconductivity, while the uniaxial pressure is beneficial
to the superconductivity. Superconducting transition temperature $T_C$ at
ambient pressure is 0.73 K, and it reduces monotonously under the hydrostatic
pressure to 0.32 K at 30 GPa. While the $T_C$ increases dramatically under the
uniaxial pressure along $c$ axis. The established $T_C$ of 6.34 K under the
uniaxial pressure of 17 GPa, below which the structural stability maintains, is
above the liquid helium temperature of 4.2 K. The increase of density of states
at Fermi level, the redshift of $F(\omega)$/$\alpha^2F(\omega)$ and the
softening of the acoustic modes with pressure are considered as the main
reasons that lead to the enhanced superconductivity under uniaxial pressure. In
view of the previously predicted topological phase transitions of $1T$-TiTe$_2$

we give an explicit code construction based on a distortion ball instead of

similar to the optimal code construction in the variable-length lossless source

the encoder is stochastic or deterministic. One-shot results yield a general
formula of the optimal rate for blocklength $n$. In addition, our general
formula is applied to asymptotic analysis for a stationary memoryless source.
As a result, we derive a single-letter characterization of the optimal rate by
using the rate-distortion and rate-dispersion functions.

leads to the formation of molecular clouds out of the diffuse interstellar
medium (ISM). One avenue of studying this interplay is by analyzing statistical
features derived from observations, where the interpretation of these features
is greatly facilitated by comparisons with numerical simulations. Here we focus
on the statistical anisotropy present in synthetic maps of velocity centroid
data, which we derive from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
a turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating patch of ISM. We study how the
orientation and magnitude of the velocity anisotropy correlate with the
magnetic field and with the structures generated by gravitational collapse.
  Motivated by recent observational constraints, our simulations focus on the
supersonic (sonic Mach number $\mathcal{M} \approx 2 - 17$) but sub- to
trans-alfvenic (alfvenic Mach number $\mathcal{M}_A \approx 0.2 - 1.2$)
turbulence regime, and we consider clouds which are barely to mildly
magnetically supercritical (mass-to-flux ratio equal to once or twice the
critical value). Additionally we explore the impact of the turbulence driving
mechanism (solenoidal or compressive) on the velocity anisotropy.
  While we confirm previous findings that the velocity anisotropy generally
aligns well with the plane-of-sky magnetic field, our inclusion of the effects
of self-gravity reveals that in regions of higher column density, the velocity
anisotropy may be destroyed or even reoriented to align with the
gravitationally formed structures. We provide evidence that this effect is not
necessarily due to the increase of $\mathcal{M}_A$ inside the high-density
regions.

investigate the power allocation among the source, relay and friendly jammers

closed-form sub-optimal solution. Specificially, all the intermediate nodes

For each candidate, we derive the sub-optimal closed-form power allocation

Then, the candidate which is capable of achieving the highest secrecy rate is
selected as the relay. Two assumptions about the channel state information
(CSI), namely the full CSI (FCSI) and partial CSI (PCSI), are considered.
Simulation results show that the proposed JRJS scheme outperforms the
conventional pure relay selection, pure jamming and GSVD based beamforming
schemes in terms of secrecy rate. Additionally, the proposed FCSI based power
allocation (FCSI-PA) and PCSI based power allocation (PCSI-PA) schemes both
achieve higher secrecy rates than the equal power allocation (EPA) scheme.

operator in this general Hamiltonian is nearly identical with that of the
Eckart-Watson operator even when curvilinear vibrational coordinates are
employed. Its different realizations correspond to different methods of
calculating Eckart displacements. There are at least two different methods for
calculating such displacements: rotation and projection. In this communication
the application of Eckart Hamiltonian operators constructed by rotation and
projection, respectively, is numerically demonstrated in calculating
vibrational energy levels. The numerical examples confirm that there is no need
for rotation to construct an Eckart ro-vibrational Hamiltonian. The application
of the gateway method is advantageous even when rotation is used, since it
obviates the need for differentiation of the matrix rotating into the Eckart
frame. Simple geometrical arguments explain that there are infinitely many
different methods for calculating Eckart displacements. The geometrical picture
also suggests that a unique Eckart displacement vector may be defined as the
shortest (mass-weighted) Eckart displacement vector among Eckart displacement
vectors corresponding to configurations related by rotation. Its length, as
shown analytically and demonstrated by way of numerical examples, is equal to
or less than that of the Eckart displacement vector one can obtain by rotation
to the Eckart frame.

has still remained a challenge. Here, we analyze two-dimensional Fourier
spectra for resonant optical excitation of resident electrons to localized
trions or donor-bound excitons in semiconductor nanostructures subject to a
transverse magnetic field. Particular attention is devoted to Raman coherence
spectra which allow one to accurately evaluate tiny splittings of the electron

ensemble. A stimulated step-like Raman process induced by a sequence of two
laser pulses creates a coherent superposition of the ground state doublet which
can be retrieved only optically due to selective excitation of the same
sub-ensemble with a third pulse. This provides the unique opportunity to
distinguish between different complexes that are closely spaced in energy in an
ensemble. The related experimental demonstration is based on photon echo
measurements in an n-type CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well structure detected by a
heterodyne technique. The difference in the sub-$\mu$eV range between the

for all the physically-relevant parameters. The goal is that of identifying the
relevant physically-meaningful asymptotic approximations applicable for the
Master kinetic equation, together with their possible relationships with the
Boltzmann and Enskog kinetic equations, and holding in appropriate asymptotic
regimes. These correspond either to dilute or dense systems and are formed
either by small-size or finite-size identical hard spheres, the distinction
between the various cases depending on suitable asymptotic orderings in terms

work we explore a scenario of electric field creation of another type of
topological defects -- magnetic vortices and antivortices, which are
characteristic for materials with easy plane (XY) symmetry. Each magnetic
(anti)vortex in magnetoelectric materials (such as type-II multiferroics)
possesses a quantized magnetic and an electric charge, where the former is
responsible for interaction between vortices and the latter couples the
vortices to electric field. This property of magnetic vortices opens a peculiar
possibility of creation of magnetic vortex plasma by non-uniform electric

a ""magnetic atom"" with a localized spatially ordered spot of vortices

analytically find the vortex density distribution profile and temperature

a smaller net by iteratively contracting certain well-formed subnets into

reveal the hierarchical structure of a WF net, and since it preserves certain
semantical properties such as soundness, it can help with analysing and
understanding why a WF net is sound or not. The reduction can also be used to
verify if a WF net is an AND-OR net. This class of WF nets was introduced in
earlier work, and arguably describes nets that follow good hierarchical design
principles. It is shown that the AND-OR reduction is confluent up to
isomorphism, which means that despite the inherent non-determinism that comes
from the choice of subnets that are contracted, the final result of the
reduction is always the same up to the choice of the identity of the nodes.
Based on this result, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented that computes
this unique result of the AND-OR reduction. Finally, it is shown how this

transformations lead to improved retrieval, classification, and clustering
algorithms due to the better adapted distance or similarity measures. Here, we
address the problem of learning these transformations when the underlying
constraint generation process is nonstationary. This nonstationarity can be due
to changes in either the ground-truth clustering used to generate constraints
or changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is apparent.
We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic Learning (OCELAD),
a general adaptive, online approach for learning and tracking optimal metrics
as they change over time that is highly robust to a variety of nonstationary
behaviors in the changing metric. We apply the OCELAD framework to an ensemble
of online learners. Specifically, we create a retro-initialized composite
objective mirror descent (COMID) ensemble (RICE) consisting of a set of
parallel COMID learners with different learning rates, and demonstrate
parameter-free RICE-OCELAD metric learning on both synthetic data and a highly
nonstationary Twitter dataset. We show significant performance improvements and
increased robustness to nonstationary effects relative to previously proposed
batch and online distance metric learning algorithms.

and offers an interpretation in which wave function is a consequence of
subquantum processes taking place at the level of the organization of matter
which underlies the phenomena described by quantum mechanics. We show that this
interpretation provides a common ground to explain problematic issues of
quantum theory (wave function collapse, electrons passing through two slits,
behavior of electrons within the atom, quantum entanglement). The paper also
shows that entropy is determined by the maximum number of macrosystem states
which appear as the result of subquantum processes.

Employing a rigid holding geometry that is first-order insensitive to the
squeezing force and a cavity geometry that improves the thermal noise limit at
room temperature, we observe a laser phase noise that is nearly thermal noise
limited for three frequency decades (1 Hz to 1 kHz offset) and supports 10 GHz
generation with phase noise near -100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset and <-173 dBc/Hz

  novel modal model accounting for the track-vehicle interaction",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is a powerful tool, widely used in the
fields of structural identification and health monitoring, and certainly
eligible for identifying the real in-operation behaviour of vehicle systems.
Several attempts can be found in the literature, for which the usage of
algorithms based on the classical OMA formulation has been strained for the
identification of passenger cars and industrial trucks. The interest is mainly
focused on the assessment of suspension behaviour and, thus, on the
identification of the so-called vehicle rigid body modes. But issues arise when
the operational identification of a vehicle system is performed, basically
related to the nature of the loads induced by the roughness of rolling
profiles. The forces exerted on the wheels, in fact, depending on their
location, are affected by time and/or spatial correlation, and, more over, do
not fit the form of white noise sequences. Thus, the nature of the excitation
strongly violate the hypotheses on which the formulation of classical OMA modal
model relies, leading to pronounced modelling errors and, in turn, to poorly
estimated modal parameters. In this paper, we develop a specialised modal
model, that we refer to as the Track-Vehicle Interaction Modal Model, able to
incorporate the character of road/rail inputs acting on vehicles during
operation. Since in this novel modal model the relationship between vehicle
system outputs and modal parameters is given explicitly, the development of new
specific curve fitting techniques, in the time-lag or frequency domain, is now
possible, making available simple and cost-effective tools for vehicle
operational identification. More over, a second, but not less important outcome
of the proposed modal model is the usage of the resulting techniques for the
indirect characterisation of rolling surface roughness, that can be used to
improve comfort and safety.
