pumped two-level system (TLS) coupled to a bath of weakly interacting Bose gas.
Using Keldysh formalism and diagrammatic perturbation theory, expressions for
the relaxation times of the TLS Rabi oscillations are derived when the boson
bath is in the normal state and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. We
apply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a
boson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath
is in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both
condensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light
coupling and dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light
coupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the
normal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi
oscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump
field frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath
is in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the
dipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation
rate on both the pump field frequency and field strength, providing a
characteristic signature for the detection of BEC phase transition of the
coupled dipolar exciton gas.

useful technique for protocol of quantum control with potential applications in
quantum information processing. In this paper we introduce a particular
protocol to perform IEH and we show how this scheme can be used for
implementing a set of quantum gates by using minimal quantum resources (such as
entanglement, interactions between more than two quits or auxiliary quits).
Remarkably, while previous protocols request three-quits interactions and/or
auxiliary quits for implementing such gates, our protocol requires just
two-qubit interactions and no auxiliary qubits. By using this approach, we can
obtain a large class of Hamiltonians that allow us to implement single and
two-quit gates necessary to quantum computation. To conclude this article, we
analyze the performance of our scheme against systematic errors related to
amplitude noise, where we show that the free parameters introduced in our
scheme can be useful for enhancing the robustness of the protocol against such
errors.

Systems that may fulfill the demands of such applications are comb-shaped spin

inhomogeneous ensemble broadening, the storage time of these quantum memories
is, however, still rather limited. Here we demonstrate how to overcome this
problem by burning well-placed holes into the spectral spin density leading to
spectacular performance in the multimode regime. Specifically, we show how an

Green Peas with HST/COS Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Green Peas are nearby star-forming
galaxies with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines. Our sample is four
times larger than the previous sample and covers a much more complete range of
Green Pea properties. We found that about 2/3 of Green Peas are strong
Ly$\alpha$ line emitters with rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width $>20$ \AA.
The Ly$\alpha$ profiles of Green Peas are diverse. The Ly$\alpha$ escape
fraction, defined as the ratio of observed Ly$\alpha$ flux to intrinsic
Ly$\alpha$ flux, shows anti-correlations with a few Ly$\alpha$ kinematic
features -- both the blue peak and red peak velocities, the peak separations,
and FWHM of the red portion of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Using properties
measured from SDSS optical spectra, we found many correlations -- Ly$\alpha$
escape fraction generally increases at lower dust reddening, lower metallicity,
lower stellar mass, and higher [OIII]/[OII] ratio. We fit their Ly$\alpha$
profiles with the HI shell radiative transfer model and found Ly$\alpha$ escape
fraction anti-correlates with the best-fit $N_{HI}$. Finally, we fit an
empirical linear relation to predict Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction from the dust
extinction and Ly$\alpha$ red peak velocity. The standard deviation of this
relation is about 0.3 dex. This relation can be used to isolate the effect of
IGM scatterings from Ly$\alpha$ escape and to probe the IGM optical depth along
the line of sight of each $z>7$ Ly$\alpha$ emission line galaxy in the JWST
era.

relaxes the assumption of explicit redundancy by calculating the expected

partial knowledge of the sky, such as point sources with known positions but
unknown fluxes. We describe a 2-level sparse matrix inverse to make the

reference implementation and use it to test the calibration of simulations of
an array with imperfectly located antennas observing Euclidean-distributed
point sources. Including position information for a handful of the brightest

$\sim$2/5 over redundant calibration for the noise levels/position errors
adopted in the simulations. Inclusion of source positions also allows us to
measure the overall phase gradient across the array, information which is lost

(QSS) for particle distributions in three dimensions interacting via an
attractive radial pair potential $V(r \rightarrow \infty) \sim 1/r^\gamma$ with
$\gamma > 0$, and either a soft-core or hard-core regularization at small $r$.
In the first part of the paper we generalize, for any spatial dimension $d \geq
2$, Chandrasekhar's approach for the case of gravity to obtain analytic
estimates of the rate of collisional relaxation due to two body collisions. The
resultant relaxation rates indicate an essential qualitative difference
depending on the integrability of the pair force at large distances: for
$\gamma >d-1$ the rate diverges in the large particle number $N$ (mean field)
limit, unless a sufficiently large soft core is present; for $\gamma < d-1$, on
the other hand, the rate vanishes in the same limit even in the absence of any
regularization. In the second part of the paper we compare our analytical
predictions with the results of extensive parallel numerical simulations in
$d=3$, for a range of different exponents $\gamma$ and soft cores leading to
the formation of QSS. We find, just as for the previously well studied case of
gravity (which we also revisit), excellent agreement between the parametric
dependence of the observed relaxation times and our analytic predictions.
Further, as in the case of gravity, we find that the results indicate that,
when large impact factors dominate, the appropriate cut-off is the size of the
system (rather than, for example, the mean inter-particle distance). Our
results provide strong evidence that the existence of QSS is robust only for
long-range interactions with a large distance behavior $\gamma < d-1$; for
$\gamma \geq d-1$ the existence of such states will be conditioned strongly on
the short range properties of the interaction.

is broken with spontaneous emergence of circulating particle current. This
implies that a finite angular momentum can be generated with neither rotation

temperature-driven phase transitions at high-pressure, such as melting, the
glass transition, magnetic and electric orderings, or superconducting

cannot be directly extracted from measurements at frequencies slower than the
timescale of conduction to the diamond anvils (10s to 100s of kHz) since the
experiment is far from adiabatic. At higher frequencies, laser-heating
experiments allow relative calorimetric measurements, where changes in specific
heat of the sample are discriminated from changes in other material properties
by scanning the heating frequency from $\sim 1$ MHz to 1 GHz. But laser-heating
generates large temperature gradients in metal samples, preventing absolute
heat capacities to be inferred. High-frequency Joule heating, on the other
hand, allows accurate, absolute specific heat measurements if it can be
performed at high-enough frequency: assuming a thin layer of KBr insulation,
the specific heat of a 5 $\mu$m-thick metal sample heated at 100 kHz, 1 MHz, or
10 MHz frequency would be measured with 30%, 8% or 2% accuracy, respectively.

ground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection monitoring data. Five successful
tracer tests were performed under various experimental conditions between two
boreholes 6 m apart. For each experiment, saline tracer was injected into a
previously identified packed-off transmissive fracture while repeatedly
acquiring single-hole GPR reflection profiles together with electrical
conductivity logs in the pumping borehole. By analyzing depth-migrated GPR

connectivity, and the geometry of fractures that contribute to tracer
transport, (2) the velocity and the mass of tracer that was carried along each
flow path, and (3) the effective transport parameters of the identified flow
paths. We find a qualitative agreement when comparing the time evolution of GPR
reflectivity strengths at strategic locations in the formation with those
arising from simulated transport. The discrepancies are on the same order as
those between observed and simulated breakthrough curves at the outflow

flow and transport properties of fracture networks. We present a novel approach
to stochastically generate three-dimensional discrete networks of connected
fractures that are conditioned to hydrological and geophysical data. A
hierarchical rejection sampling algorithm is used to draw realizations from the
posterior probability density function at different conditioning levels. The
method is applied to a well-studied granitic formation using data acquired
within two boreholes located 6 m apart. The prior models include 27 fractures
with their geometry (position and orientation) bounded by information derived
from single-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired during saline
tracer tests and optical televiewer logs. Eleven cross-hole hydraulic
connections between fractures in neighboring boreholes and the order in which
the tracer arrives at different fractures are used for conditioning.
Furthermore, the networks are conditioned to the observed relative hydraulic
importance of the different hydraulic connections by numerically simulating the
flow response. Among the conditioning data considered, constraints on the
relative flow contributions were the most effective in determining the
variability among the network realizations. Nevertheless, we find that the
posterior model space is strongly determined by the imposed prior bounds.
Strong prior bounds were derived from GPR measurements and helped to make the
approach computationally feasible. We analyze a set of 230 posterior
realizations that reproduce all data given their uncertainties assuming the
same uniform transmissivity in all fractures. The posterior models provide
valuable statistics on length scales and density of connected fractures, as
well as their connectivity.

parameters arise in a variety of fields. To cope with those, three common
methods are widely considered: (1) jointly estimating the parameters of
interest and the nuisance parameters, (2) projecting out the nuisance
parameters, (3) selecting a reference and then taking differences between the
reference and the observations, which we will refer to as ""differential signal
processing."" A lot of literature has been devoted to these methods, yet all
follow separate paths.
  Based on a unified framework, we analytically explore the relations between
these three methods, where we particularly focus on the third one and introduce
a general differential approach to cope with multiple distinct nuisance
parameters. After a proper whitening procedure, the corresponding best linear
unbiased estimators (BLUEs) are shown to be all equivalent to each other.
Accordingly, we unveil some surprising facts, which are in contrast to what is
commonly considered in literature, e.g., the reference choice is actually not
important for the differencing process. Since this paper formulates the problem
in a general manner, one may specialize our conclusions to any particular
application. Some localization examples are also presented in this paper to
verify our conclusions.

high noise levels (i.e. for low source galaxy densities and/or high shape
measurement uncertainties), both normal and lognormal priors lead to
reconstructions of comparable quality, but with the lognormal reconstruction
being prone to mass-sheet degeneracy. In the low-noise regime and on small
scales, the lognormal model produces better reconstructions than the normal
model: The lognormal model 1) enforces non-negative densities, while negative
densities are present when a normal prior is employed, 2) better traces the
extremal values and the skewness of the true underlying distribution, and 3)
yields a higher pixel-wise correlation between the reconstruction and the true
density.

  over Q",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by our arithmetic applications, we required some tools that might
be of independent interest.
  Let $\mathcal E$ be an absolutely irreducible group scheme of rank $p^4$ over
$\mathbb Z_p$. We provide a complete description of the Honda systems of
$p$-divisible groups $\mathcal G$ such that $\mathcal G[p^{n+1}]/\mathcal
G[p^n] \simeq \mathcal E$ for all $n$. Then we find a bound for the abelian
conductor of the second layer $\mathbb Q_p(\mathcal G[p^2])/\mathbb
Q_p(\mathcal G[p])$, stronger in our case than can be deduced from Fontaine's
bound.
  Let $\pi\!: \, {\rm Sp}_{2g}(\mathbb Z_p) \to {\rm Sp}_{2g}(\mathbb F_p)$ be
the reduction map and let $G$ be a closed subgroup of ${\rm Sp}_{2g}(\mathbb
Z_p)$ with $\overline{G} = \pi(G)$ irreducible and generated by transvections.
We fill a gap in the literature by showing that if $p=2$ and $G$ contains a
transvection, then $G$ is as large as possible in ${\rm Sp}_{2g}(\mathbb Z_p)$
with given reduction $\overline{G}$, i.e. $G = \pi^{-1}(\overline{G})$.
  One simple application arises when $A = J(C)$ is the Jacobian of a
hyperelliptic curve $C\!: \, y^2 + Q(x)y = P(x)$, where $Q(x)^2 + 4P(x)$ is
irreducible in $\mathbb Z[x]$ of degree $m=2g+1$ or $2g+2$, with Galois group
$\mathcal S_m \subset {\rm Sp}_{2g}(\mathbb F_2)$. If the Igusa discriminant
$I_{10}$ of $C$ is odd and some prime $q$ exactly divides $I_{10}$, then $G =
{\operatorname{Gal}}(\mathbb Q(A[2^\infty])/\mathbb Q)$ is
$\tilde{\pi}^{-1}(\mathcal S_m)$, where $\tilde{\pi}\!: \, {\rm
GSp}_{2g}(\mathbb Z_p) \to {\rm Sp}_{2g}(\mathbb F_p)$.
  When $m = 5$, $Q(x) = 1$ and $I_{10} = N$ is a prime, $A = J(C)$ is an
example of a $\textit{favorable}$ abelian surface. We use the machinery above
to obtain non-existence results for certain favorable abelian surfaces, even
for large $N$.

drawup events of log-returns for an underlying asset modeled by a spectrally
negative geometric L\'evy process. We consider four contracts, three of which
were introduced in Zhang et al. (2013) for a geometric Brownian motion. The
first one is an insurance contract where the protection buyer pays a constant
premium until the drawdown of fixed size of log-returns occurs. In return
he/she receives a certain insured amount at the drawdown epoch. The next
insurance contract provides protection from any specified drawdown with a
drawup contingency. This contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup event
occurs prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of
the previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows the
investor to terminate the contract earlier. We focus on two problems:
calculating the fair premium $p$ for the basic contracts and identifying the
optimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature. To do
this we solve some two-sided exit problems related to drawdown and drawup of
spectrally negative L\'evy processes, which is of independent mathematical
interest. We also heavily rely on the theory of optimal stopping.

cameras, inertial measurement units, and 3D laser scanners. Often, solving a

while there are undeniable benefits to combine sensors of different modalities
the process tends to be complicated. Segmenting scenes observed by the robot
into a discrete set of classes is a central requirement for autonomy as
understanding the scene is the first step to reason about future situations.
Scene segmentation is commonly performed using either image data or 3D point
cloud data. In computer vision many successful methods for scene segmentation
are based on conditional random fields (CRF) where the maximum a posteriori
(MAP) solution to the segmentation can be obtained by inference. In this paper
we devise a new CRF inference method for scene segmentation that incorporates
global constraints, enforcing the sets of nodes are assigned the same class
label. To do this efficiently, the CRF is formulated as a relaxed quadratic
program whose MAP solution is found using a gradient-based optimisation
approach. The proposed method is evaluated on images and 3D point cloud data
gathered in urban environments where image data provides the appearance
features needed by the CRF, while the 3D point cloud data provides global
spatial constraints over sets of nodes. Comparisons with belief propagation,
conventional quadratic programming relaxation, and higher order potential CRF
show the benefits of the proposed method.

Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg degeneration of the moduli space of G-bundles Bun_G

dual group of G.
  In the first part of the article we study the monodromy action on the nearby
cycles sheaf along the principal degeneration of Bun_G. We describe the
weight-monodromy filtration in terms of the combinatorics of the Langlands dual
group of G and generalizations of the Picard-Lefschetz oscillators found in
[Sch1]. Our proofs use certain local models for the principal degeneration
whose geometry is studied in the second part.
  Our local models simultaneously provide two types of degenerations of the
Zastava spaces, which together equip the Zastava spaces with the geometric
analog of a Hopf algebra structure. The first degeneration corresponds to the
usual Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion of divisors on the curve. The second
degeneration is new and corresponds to what we call Vinberg fusion: It is
obtained not by degenerating divisors on the curve, but by degenerating the
group G via the Vinberg semigroup. On the level of cohomology the Vinberg
fusion gives rise to an algebra structure, while the Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion
gives rise to a coalgebra structure; the Hopf algebra axiom is a consequence of
the underlying geometry.
  It is natural to conjecture that this Hopf algebra agrees with the universal
enveloping algebra of the positive part of the Langlands dual Lie algebra. The
above procedure would then yield a novel and highly geometric way to pass to
the Langlands dual side: Elements of the Langlands dual Lie algebra are
represented as cycles on the above moduli spaces, and the Lie bracket of two
elements is obtained by deforming the cartesian product cycle along the Vinberg
degeneration.

object and Source I, located behind the Orion Nebula, were ejected with
velocities of $\sim$29 and $\sim$13 km s$^{-1}$ about 500 years ago by such
interactions. This event generated an explosion in the gas. New ALMA
observations show in unprecedented detail, a roughly spherically symmetric
distribution of over a hundred $^{12}$CO J=2$-$1 streamers with velocities
extending from V$_{LSR}$ =$-$150 to +145 km s$^{-1}$. The streamer radial
velocities increase (or decrease) linearly with projected distance from the
explosion center, forming a `Hubble Flow' confined to within 50 arcseconds of
the explosion center. They point toward the high proper-motion, shock-excited
H$_2$ and [Fe ii ] `fingertips' and lower-velocity CO in the H$_2$ wakes
comprising Orion's `fingers'. In some directions, the H$_2$ `fingers' extend
more than a factor of two farther from the ejection center than the CO
streamers. Such deviations from spherical symmetry may be caused by ejecta
running into dense gas or the dynamics of the N-body interaction that ejected
the stars and produced the explosion. This $\sim$10$^{48}$ erg event may have
been powered by the release of gravitational potential energy associated with
the formation of a compact binary or a protostellar merger. Orion may be the
prototype for a new class of stellar explosion responsible for luminous
infrared transients in nearby galaxies.

main computation complexity for exemplar-based face sketch synthesis methods
lies in the neighbor selection process. State-of-the-art face sketch synthesis
methods perform neighbor selection online in a data-driven manner by $K$
nearest neighbor ($K$-NN) searching. Actually, the online search increases the

the whole training dataset for neighbor selection, the computational complexity
increases with the scale of the training database and hence these methods have

normally found a pattern of the radial outflow near the midplane, switching to

which is inward at all altitudes, is possible in disks with entropy and
temperature steeply increasing with height. Such thermodynamic conditions may
be typical in the optically thin, viscously heated accretion disks. Disks in
which these conditions do not hold should feature radial outflow near the

Our results can also be used for designing hydrodynamical disk simulations with
a prescribed pattern of the meridional circulation.

thermodynamics in Markovian limit, we adopt a completely different treatment
which is developed in the context of classical stochastic processes. Our result
generally excludes the possibility of a process with finite speed at the Carnot

traffic forecasting to predict the road traffic at the particular site in a
short period is often useful and important. In existing works, Seasonal
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is a popular approach.
The scheme however encounters two challenges: 1) the analysis on related data
is insufficient whereas some important features of data may be neglected; and
2) with data presenting different features, it is unlikely to have one
predictive model that can fit all situations. To tackle above issues, in this
work, we develop a hybrid model to improve accuracy of SARIMA. In specific, we
first explore the autocorrelation and distribution features existed in traffic
flow to revise structure of the time series model. Based on the Gaussian
distribution of traffic flow, a hybrid model with a Bayesian learning algorithm
is developed which can effectively expand the application scenarios of SARIMA.
We show the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal using both analysis and
experimental studies. Using the real-world trace data, we show that the
proposed predicting approach can achieve satisfactory performance in practice.

mobile devices to facilitate largescale crowdsourcing tasks (e.g. urban sensing

Device-to-Device (D2D) communications between participating devices for
interactive operations such as task collaborations and file transmissions.
Considering the private participating devices and their opportunistic
encountering behaviors, it is highly desired to establish secure and
trustworthy D2D connections in a fast and autonomous way, which is vital for
implementing practical Mobile Crowdsourcing Systems (MCSs). In this paper, we
develop an efficient scheme, Trustworthy Device Pairing (TDP), which achieves
user-transparent secure D2D connections and reliable peer device selections for
trustworthy D2D communications. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and security intensity of TDP in theory. The performance of TDP
is evaluated based on both real-world prototype experiments and extensive
trace-driven simulations. Evaluation results verify our theoretical analysis
and show that TDP significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of
pairing speed, stability, and security.

transmission capacity between the resource vehicle and the destination vehicle
is evaluated. If the requested file can be successfully transferred over the
direct Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) connection, the file transfer will be
completed by the resource and the destination themselves. Otherwise, a cluster
will be formed to help the file transfer. As a fully-distributed scheme that
relies on the collaboration of cluster members, CFT does not require any
assistance from roadside units or access points. Our experimental results
indicate that CFT outperforms the existing file transfer schemes for highway

request is served by sending it to the root before its deadline at a cost equal
to the weight of the path from the node in which it resides to the root.
However, requests from different nodes can be aggregated, and served together,
so as to save on cost. The cost of serving an aggregated set of requests is
equal to the weight of the subtree spanning the nodes in which the requests
reside. Thus, the problem is to find a competitive online aggregation algorithm
that minimizes the total cost of the aggregated requests. This problem arises
naturally in many scenarios, including multicasting, supply-chain management

admit a polynomial kernel unless $\NP \subseteq \coNP / \poly$. Independently

study the complexity of \probrFixSwap, where the only difference from \probrFix

that for every $r \geq 3$, the problem \probrFixSwap is $\W[1]$-hard whereas
\probrFix is known to be FPT. Moreover, when $r$ is part of the input, we
observe both \probFix and \probFixSwap are $\W[1]$-hard parameterized by

some finite number of swaps. For instance, we prove that for $r=3$, the

steady state on the system by creating effective potentials in otherwise
homogeneous space. An example of stable and unstable rectifications of thermal

management in wireless networks. On the other hand, simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) has become an emerging technique.
Although some works have been done on IA and SWIPT, these two important areas
have traditionally been addressed separately in the literature. In this paper,
we propose to use a common framework to jointly study IA and SWIPT. We analyze
the performance of SWIPT in IA networks. Specifically, we derive the upper
bound of the power that can be harvested in IA networks. In addition, we show
that, to improve the performance of wireless power transfer and information
transmission, users should be dynamically selected as energy harvesting (EH) or
information decoding (ID) terminals. Furthermore, we design two
easy-implemented SWIPT-user selection (SWIPT-US) algorithms in IA networks. To
optimize the ID and EH performance of SWIPT in IA networks, a power-splitting
optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed when power splitters are available,
and its closed-form optimal solutions are derived. Power allocation in the PSO
algorithm is also studied to further optimize the performance. Simulation
results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

the duration of a single step, i.e., a ballistic motion performed by a walker,
is governed by a power-law tailed distribution of infinite variance and finite
mean. We demonstrate that the probability density function (PDF) of the
coordinate of the random walker has two different scaling limits at large
times. One limit describes the bulk of the PDF. It is the $d-$dimensional
generalization of the one-dimensional L\'evy distribution and is the
counterpart of central limit theorem (CLT) for random walks with finite
dispersion. In contrast with the one-dimensional L\'evy distribution and the
CLT this distribution does not have universal shape. The PDF reflects
anisotropy of the single-step statistics however large the time is. The other
scaling limit, the so-called 'infinite density', describes the tail of the PDF
which determines second (dispersion) and higher moments of the PDF. This limit
repeats the angular structure of PDF of velocity in one step. Typical
realization of the walk consists of anomalous diffusive motion (described by
anisotropic $d-$dimensional L\'evy distribution) intermitted by long ballistic
flights (described by infinite density). The long flights are rare but due to
them the coordinate increases so much that their contribution determines the
dispersion. We illustrate the concept by considering two types of L\'evy walks,
with isotropic and anisotropic distributions of velocities. Furthermore, we
show that for isotropic but otherwise arbitrary velocity distribution the
$d-$dimensional process can be reduced to one-dimensional L\'evy walk.

polarization would have required a pseudospin g-factor exceeding 40. To
investigate the magnetic response, we use polarization resolved
photoluminescence as well as resonant reflection measurements. In the latter,
we observe gate voltage dependent transfer of oscillator strength from the
exciton to the attractive-Fermi-polaron: stark differences in the spectrum of
the two light helicities provide a confirmation of valley polarization. Our
findings suggest an interaction induced giant paramagnetic response of MoSe2,
which paves the way for valleytronics applications.

any such realization of $G$ can be translated up to a quadratic field over

  The sufficient conditions are imposed on a parametric polynomial with Galois

by Slater (J. Phys. A 40 [2007] 14279). In the Lovas-Andai framework, the
independent variable $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$ is the ratio $\sigma(V)$ of the
singular values of the $2 \times 2$ matrix $V=D_2^{1/2} D_1^{-1/2}$ formed from
the two $2 \times 2$ diagonal blocks ($D_1, D_2$) of a $4 \times 4$ density

diagonal-entry ratio $\sqrt{\frac{\rho_{11} \rho_{44}}{\rho_{22}

$\mu=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ when both $D_1$ and $D_2$ are themselves diagonal.
Lovas and Andai established that their two-rebit ""separability function""
$\tilde{\chi}_1 (\varepsilon )$ ($\approx \varepsilon$) yields the previously
conjectured Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability of $\frac{29}{64}$. We are
able, in the Slater framework (using cylindrical algebraic decompositions [CAD]
to enforce positivity constraints), to reproduce this result. Further, we newly
find its two-qubit (yielding $\frac{8}{33}$), two-quater[nionic]-bit (yielding
$\frac{26}{323}$) and ""two-octo[nionic]-bit"" (yielding $\frac{44482}{4091349}$)

develops an order-4 recurrence satisfied by the predictions of the several

we show how to generalize Fano's inequality under both the conventional and

allowing $M$ to be infinite, a lower bound on the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional

upper and lower bounds on the minimum error probability are obtained as a
function of the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional entropy for both positive and

yield useful information about relationships too remote to be detected by

prediction of patterns and motifs in mutual structural fragments. With the
exponential increase of structural proteomics data, the methods that scale with
the rate of increase of data lose efficiency. Hence, new methods that reduce
the computational expense of this problem should be developed. We present a
novel framework through which we are able to find and align protein structure
neighbors via hierarchical clustering and entropy-based query search, and
present a web-based protein database search and alignment tool to demonstrate
the applicability of our approach. The resulting method replicates the results
of the current gold standard with a minimal loss in sensitivity in a
significantly shorter amount of time, while ameliorating the existing web
workspace of protein structure comparison with a customized and dynamic
web-based environment. Our tool serves as both a functional industrial means of
protein structure comparison and a valid demonstration of heuristics in
proteomics.
