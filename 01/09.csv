class) optical spectroscopic survey telescope with a field of view comparable
to that of LSST. Such a facility could enable transformational progress in
several areas of astrophysics, and may constitute an unmatched capability for
decades. Deep imaging from LSST and Euclid will provide accurate photometry for
spectroscopic targets beyond the reach of 4m class instruments. Such a facility
would revolutionise our understanding of the assembly and enrichment history of
the Milky Way and the role of dark matter through chemo-dynamical studies of
tens of millions of stars in the Local Group. Emission and absorption line
spectroscopy of redshift z=2-5 galaxies can be used to directly chart the
evolution of the cosmic web and examine its connection with activity in
galaxies. The facility will also have synergistic impact, e.g. in following up
live and transpired transients found with LSST, as well as providing targets
and the local environmental conditions for follow-up studies with E-ELT and
future space missions. Although our study is exploratory, we highlight a
specific telescope design with a 5 square degree field of view and an
additional focus that could host a next-generation panoramic IFU. We discuss
some technical challenges and operational models and recommend a conceptual
design study aimed at completing a more rigorous science case in the context of
a costed technical design.

both hints. In one scenario the requirement is that the expected number of
guesses it takes Bob to guess the password approach one as n tends to infinity,

As a result, the system becomes unstable against the density fluctuations under

collective excitation spectra. We trace the evolution of the spectrum of the
collective excitations and their spin-charge structures with the change in the

grows to become unstable at its critical value. Interestingly, this mode
evolves from a pure spin excitation to a pure charge one. At the critical point
its velocity turns to zero together with the charge stiffness.

provide a unique vantage point for studying the properties of phosphorene, a

nanodevices have remained largely unexplored due to the lack of air stability
observed in phosphorene under ambient conditions. This study investigates a
novel nanofabrication technique that effectively enhances the air stability and
practical scalability of graphene-analogous phosphorene. A phosphorene-WS2
heterostructure was first designed and synthesized via micromechanical
exfoliation and dry transfer methods. A novel umbrella contact was fabricated
using electron beam lithography which extended the electrical anode over the
phosphorene heterojunction region. SEM, Raman spectroscopy, gate transport, and
photocurrent response techniques were employed to characterize the device
physically and electronically. Devices fabricated with an extended anodic
contact remained functional for extended periods of time, suggesting that the
contact had prevented the phosphorene from degradation in ambient conditions.
Preliminary results obtained via current response indicate a promising
heterojunction with high speed transistor properties. This work suggests the
unprecedented longevity and practical scalability of phosphorene utilizing a
novel contact nanofabrication technique. Potential applications of the
nanodevice include next generation electronic devices, photodetectors, energy

coefficients are introduced. These provide an effective notion of approximate

polynomials, as a non-commutative generalization of the well-studied
approximate GCD problem.
  Given two differential polynomials, we present an algorithm to find nearby
differential polynomials with a non-trivial GCRD, where nearby is defined with
respect to a suitable coefficient norm. Intuitively, given two linear
differential polynomials as input, the (approximate) GCRD problem corresponds
to finding the (approximate) differential polynomial whose solution space is
the intersection of the solution spaces of the two inputs.
  The approximate GCRD problem is proven to be locally well-posed. A method
based on the singular value decomposition of a differential Sylvester matrix is
developed to produce an initial approximation of the GCRD. With a sufficiently
good initial approximation, Newton iteration is shown to converge quadratically
to an optimal solution. Finally, sufficient conditions for existence of a
solution to the global problem are presented along with examples demonstrating
that no solution exists when these conditions are not satisfied.

using the Quantum Operator Form (QOF); a new representation of quantum circuit

CV$^\dagger$ quantum gates. The proposed form is a quantum extension to the
well known Reed-Muller but unlike the Reed-Muller form, the QOF allows the
usage of different quantum gates. Therefore QOF permits minimization of quantum
circuits by using properties of different gates than only the multi-control
Toffoli gates. We introduce a set of minimization rules and a pseudo-algorithm
that can be used to design circuits with the CNOT, CV and CV$^\dagger$ quantum

markets, which has received much attention in the past decade. Its popularity
arose from a tractable asymptotic expansion for implied volatility, derived by
heat kernel methods. As markets moved to historically low rates, this expansion
appeared to yield inconsistent prices. Since the model is deeply embedded in
market practice, alternative pricing methods for SABR have been addressed in
numerous approaches in recent years. All standard option pricing methods make
certain regularity assumptions on the underlying model, but for SABR these are
rarely satisfied. We examine here regularity properties of the model from this
perspective with view to a number of (asymptotic and numerical) option pricing
methods. In particular, we highlight delicate degeneracies of the SABR model
(and related processes) at the origin, which deem the currently used popular
heat kernel methods and all related methods from (sub-) Riemannian geometry
ill-suited for SABR-type processes, when interest rates are near zero. We
describe a more general semigroup framework, which permits to derive a suitable
geometry for SABR-type processes (in certain parameter regimes) via symmetric
Dirichlet forms. Furthermore, we derive regularity properties (Feller-
properties and strong continuity properties) necessary for the applicability of
popular numerical schemes to SABR-semigroups, and identify suitable Banach- and
Hilbert spaces for these. Finally, we comment on the short time and large time
asymptotic behaviour of SABR-type processes beyond the heat-kernel framework.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); however, a detailed explanation of their central
engine is still lacking. The annihilation of neutrino pairs has been proposed
as one of the possible powering mechanisms. We present calculations of the
energy and momentum deposition operated by neutrino pair annihilation above
merger remnants. Starting from the results of a detailed, three-dimensional
simulation of the aftermath of a binary neutron star merger, we compute the
deposition rates over a time scale comparable to the life time of the disk ($t
\approx 0.4$ s), assuming a long-lived massive neutron star (MNS). We model
neutrino emission using a spectral leakage scheme and compute the neutrino
annihilation rates using a ray-tracing algorithm. We find that the presence of
the MNS increases the energy deposition rate by a factor $\sim 2$, mainly due
to the annihilation of radiation coming from the MNS with radiation coming from
the disk. We compute the impact of relativistic effects and discover that,
despite they can significantly change the local rate intensity, the
volume-integrated results are only marginally decreased. The cumulative
deposited energy, extrapolated to 1 sec, is $\approx 2.2 \times 10^{49} \, {\rm
erg}$. A comparison with the inferred short GRB energetics reveals that in most
cases this energy is not large enough, even assuming small jet opening angles
and a long-lived MNS. Significantly more intense neutrino luminosities (a
factor ~5-10 larger) are required to explain most of the observed short GRB. We
conclude that it is unlikely that neutrino pair annihilation can explain the
central engine of short GRBs alone.

properly designed electric field pulse. Specifically, we predict that an
ultrafast electric field pulse can cause a negative ECE up to 35 K in PbTiO$_3$
occurring on few picosecond time scales. We acquire and analyze these results
by clarifying the mechanism of ECE during an adiabatic irreversible process; In
addition to the conventional explanation of the ECE with entropy reallocation,
we simply portray the ECE with the concept of internal energy redistribution.
Electric field does work on a ferroelectric crystal and redistributes its
internal energy. How the kinetic energy is redistributed determines the
temperature change and strongly depends on the electric field temporal profile.
This concept is supported by our all--atom molecular dynamics simulations of
PbTiO$_3$ and BaTiO$_3$. Based on this improved understanding of ECE, we
propose strategies for inducing both giant and negative ECE. This work offers a
more general framework to understand the ECE and highlights the opportunities

several real-world RSs operate in the cross-domain scenario, where the system

evaluation framework, explicitly suited for the cross-domain recommendation
scenario. We show that having access to the preferences of the users in the
auxiliary domain may have a huge impact on the performance of active learning
strategies w.r.t. the classical, single-domain scenario.

frequency in the data is high compared to the expected frequency under a null

the Minimum Description Length (MDL) literature to define a new measure of

within the exposure pool. If the exposure pool is inhomogeneous with respect to
the asset correlation itself then the error may be going in both directions,

correlation is systematically underestimated. Both effects stack up and the
error tends to become even larger if in addition a negative correlation between
asset correlation and PD is assumed, which is plausible in many circumstances

measured from default data tend to be lower than asset correlations derived

searches in this topology, which exclusively relied on effective field
theories, the results are interpreted in terms of a simplified model of dark
matter production for both vector and axial vector couplings between a mediator
and dark matter particles. The first study of this class of models using CMS
data at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV is presented. Additionally, effective field theories
of dark matter and unparticle production are used to interpret the data.

the capacity of this channel as a function of $C_0$. What is the critical value
of $C_0$ such that $C(C_0)$ first equals $C(\infty)$? This is a long-standing
open problem posed by Cover and named ""The Capacity of the Relay Channel,"" in
$Open \ Problems \ in \ Communication \ and \ Computation$, Springer-Verlag,
1987. In this paper, we answer this question in the Gaussian case and show that
$C(C_0)$ can not equal to $C(\infty)$ unless $C_0=\infty$, regardless of the
SNR of the Gaussian channels. This result follows as a corollary to a new upper
bound we develop on the capacity of this channel. Instead of
""single-letterizing"" expressions involving information measures in a
high-dimensional space as is typically done in converse results in information
theory, our proof directly quantifies the tension between the pertinent
$n$-letter forms. This is done by translating the information tension problem
to a problem in high-dimensional geometry. As an intermediate result, we
develop an extension of the classical isoperimetric inequality on a
high-dimensional sphere, which can be of interest in its own right.

wireless communication links to transition from line-of-sight (LOS) to
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, which can greatly reduce the received
power, particularly at higher frequencies such as millimeter wave (mmWave). We
consider a cellular network in which a mobile user attempts to connect to two
or more base stations (BSs) simultaneously, to increase the probability of at
least one LOS link, which is a form of macrodiversity. We develop a framework
for determining the LOS probability as a function of the number of BSs, when
taking into account the correlation between blockages: for example, a single
blockage close to the device -- including the user's own body -- could block
multiple BSs. We consider the impact of the size of blocking objects on the
system reliability probability and show that macrodiversity gains are higher
when the blocking objects are small. We also show that the BS density must
scale as the square of the blockage density to maintain a given level of
reliability.

linearized, with direct applications in large-scale statistical learning and
fast near neighbor search. The linearized GMM kernel was extensively compared
in with linearized radial basis function (RBF) kernel. On a large number of
classification tasks, the tuning-free GMM kernel performs (surprisingly) well
compared to the best-tuned RBF kernel. Nevertheless, one would naturally expect
that the GMM kernel ought to be further improved if we introduce tuning
parameters.
  In this paper, we study three simple constructions of tunable GMM kernels:
(i) the exponentiated-GMM (or eGMM) kernel, (ii) the powered-GMM (or pGMM)
kernel, and (iii) the exponentiated-powered-GMM (epGMM) kernel. The pGMM kernel
can still be efficiently linearized by modifying the original hashing procedure
for the GMM kernel. On about 60 publicly available classification datasets, we
verify that the proposed tunable GMM kernels typically improve over the
original GMM kernel. On some datasets, the improvements can be astonishingly
significant.
  For example, on 11 popular datasets which were used for testing deep learning
algorithms and tree methods, our experiments show that the proposed tunable GMM
kernels are strong competitors to trees and deep nets. The previous studies
developed tree methods including ""abc-robust-logitboost"" and demonstrated the
excellent performance on those 11 datasets (and other datasets), by
establishing the second-order tree-split formula and new derivatives for
multi-class logistic loss. Compared to tree methods like
""abc-robust-logitboost"" (which are slow and need substantial model sizes), the
tunable GMM kernels produce largely comparable results.

then each runner will at some time be separated by a distance of at least
$\frac{1}{n+1}$ from the others. In this paper we make some remarks on this

slightly for large $n$, to $\frac{1}{2n} + \frac{c \log n}{n^2 (\log\log n)^2}$
for some absolute constant $c>0$; previous improvements were roughly of the

the input registers, avoiding any reference to the notion of a purification of
the classical input state. We provide an exact operational interpretation of
this alternative characterization as the sum of the cost of transmitting
information about the classical inputs and the cost of forgetting information
about these inputs. To obtain this characterization, we prove a general lemma,
the Information Flow Lemma, assessing exactly the transfer of information in
general interactive quantum processes. Furthermore, we clarify the link between
QIC and IC of classical protocols by simulating quantumly classical protocols.
  Finally, we apply these concepts to argue that any quantum protocol that does
not forget information solves Disjointness on n-bits in Omega (n)
communication, completely losing the quadratic quantum speedup. This provides a
specific sense in which forgetting information is a necessary feature of
interactive quantum protocols. We also apply these concepts to prove that QIC
at zero-error is exactly n for the Inner Product function, and n (1 - o(1)) for
a random Boolean function on n+n bits.

for large grains expected in the protoplanetary disks and find that mm-sized
grains at midplane do not align with the magnetic field as the Larmor
precession timescale for such large grains becomes longer than the gaseous
damping timescale. Hence, for these grains the RAT theory predicts that the
alignment axis is determined by the grain precession with respect to the
radiative flux. As a result, we expect that the polarization will be in the
azimuthal direction for a face-on disk. It is also shown that if dust grains
have superparamagnetic inclusions, magnetic field alignment is possible for
(sub-)micron grains at the surface layer of disks, and this can be tested by
mid-infrared polarimetric observations.

stable of the three to changes, although it does not, at the moment, go to high
enough redshifts to tightly constrain the dark energy equation of state, $w$.
Union2.1, drawn from many different sources, appears somewhat susceptible to
changes within the dataset. JLA reconstructs well for a smaller number of
cosmological parameters. At higher degrees of freedom, the dependence of its
errors on redshift can lead to varying results between subsets. Panstarrs is
inconsistent with the other two at about $2\sigma$, and JLA and Union2.1 are
about $1\sigma$ away from each other. For the $\Omega_{0m}-w$ cosmological
reconstruction, the $1\sigma$ range of values in $w$ for selected subsets of
each dataset is two times larger for JLA and Union2.1 as compared to Panstarrs.
The range in $\Omega_{0m}$ for the same subsets remains approximately similar
for all three datasets. Although there are differences in the fitting and
correction techniques used in the different samples, the most important
criterion is SNe selection, a slightly different SNe selection can lead to
noticeably different results both in the purely statistical analysis and
cosmological reconstruction. We note that a single, high quality low redshift
sample could help decrease the uncertainties in the result. We also note that
lack of homogeneity in the magnitude errors may bias the results and should
either be modeled, or its effect neutralized by using other, complementary
datasets. A supernova sample with high quality data at both high and low
redshifts, constructed from a few surveys to avoid heterogeneity in the sample,
and with homogeneous errors, would result in a more robust cosmological
reconstruction.

N2H+, C2H, HC3N, and HNC and found that they are not much different from
previous studies made in other massive star-forming regions. However, their
abundances are relatively low compared to infrared dark clouds (IRDCs). The

Besides, the fractional abundances of N2H+, C2H, and HC3N seem to decrease as a
function of their Lyman continuum fluxes (NL), indicating that these molecules

which the opinion distribution of a population evolves via sequential random

structure for a Gaussian random vector. It is recognized as a powerful tool in
different applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech
language, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection
is a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample
of a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection
are suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family
of individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach
leads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical
procedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic
of these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing
literature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect
edge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also
important to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type
II error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection
problem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of
statistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses.
Additive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We
construct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine
them to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the
obtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear
combination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of
unbiased multiple decision procedures.

theoretically solid nonlinear-type time-frequency analyses techniques, the
de-shape short time Fourier transform and the synchrosqueezing transform, which
allows us to extract the instantaneous physiological information from the PPG

the algorithm by a simulated signal and discussing the meaning of

contains PPG signals relative to spontaneous or controlled breathing in static

diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that
although the viscosity ratio of PP/COC blend was unfavorable for COC droplet
deformation, the COC phase was converted to finely dispersed fibrils in PP
matrix. This could be asserted to the high elasticity of the COC droplets that
suppressed the droplet breakup in the favor of fibrillation process. The high
glass transition temperature of COC (140 degree centigrade) could also assist
restoring the generated microfibril morphology upon cooling. The experimental
results also depicted that the droplet deformation and microfibril formation of
PP/COC/organoclay nanocomposites mainly depend on the organoclay partitioning,
which could be controlled predominantly by kinetic parameters. While the
localization of organoclay in the PP matrix resulted in smaller COC droplets
and fibrils with smaller diameter, the presence of organoclay inside COC
droplets reduced the droplet deformability, leading to fibrils with larger
diameter.

properties and is not less instrumental in applications. We show that the
strong metric subregularity of a mapping F acting between metric spaces is
stable under perturbations of the form f + F, where f is a function with a
small calmness constant. This result is parallel to the Lyusternik-Graves
theorem for metric regularity and to the Robinson theorem for strong
regularity, where the perturbations are represented by a function f with a
small Lipschitz constant. Then we study perturbation stability of the same kind
for mappings acting between Banach spaces, where f is not necessarily
differentiable but admits a set-valued derivative-like approximation. Strong
metric q-subregularity is also considered, where q is a positive real constant
appearing as exponent in the definition. Rockafellar's criterion for strong
metric subregularity involving injectivity of the graphical derivative is
extended to mappings acting in infinite-dimensional spaces. A sufficient
condition for strong metric subregularity is established in terms of
surjectivity of the Frechet coderivative. Various versions of Newton's method

Here, taking MoS2 as an example, we review the key factors that bring down the
mobility in TMDC transistors, including phonons, charged impurities, defects,
and charge traps. We introduce a theoretical model that quantitatively captures
the scaling of mobility with temperature, carrier density and thickness. By
fitting the available mobility data from literature over the past few years, we
are able to obtain the density of impurities and traps for a wide range of
transistor structures. We show that interface engineering such as oxide surface
passivation, high-k dielectrics and BN encapsulation could effectively reduce
the impurities, leading to improved device performances. For few-layer TMDCs,
we analytically model the lopsided carrier distribution to elucidate the
experimental increase of mobility with the number of layers. From our analysis,
it is clear that the charge transport in TMDC samples is a very complex problem
that must be handled carefully. We hope that this Review can provide new
insights and serve as a starting point for further improving the performance of
TMDC transistors.

of-the-art localization and tracking methods in the wireless sensor networks is

indoor scenario. This limitation can be handled up to a large extent by
employing a large number of existing access points (APs) in the range free

magnetic, inertial, compass, gyroscope, ultrasound, infrared, visual and/or

  Computing, Dec. 2016. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1610.07284",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing decentralized policies for wireless communication networks is a
crucial problem, which has only been partially solved in the literature so far.
In this paper, we propose the Decentralized Markov Decision Process (Dec-MDP)
framework to analyze a wireless sensor network with multiple users which access
a common wireless channel. We consider devices with energy harvesting
capabilities, so that they aim at balancing the energy arrivals with the data
departures and with the probability of colliding with other nodes. Randomly
over time, an access point triggers a SYNC slot, wherein it recomputes the
optimal transmission parameters of the whole network, and distributes this
information. Every node receives its own policy, which specifies how it should
access the channel in the future, and, thereafter, proceeds in a fully
decentralized fashion, without interacting with other entities in the network.
We propose a multi-layer Markov model, where an external MDP manages the jumps
between SYNC slots, and an internal Dec-MDP computes the optimal policy in the
near future. We numerically show that, because of the harvesting, a fully
orthogonal scheme (e.g., TDMA-like) is suboptimal in energy harvesting
scenarios, and the optimal trade-off lies between an orthogonal and a random
access system.

binary scattering together with nucleon transfer is dominant, and the
probability of elastic+inelastic scattering events increases rapidly with
impact parameter in peripheral collisions and approaches to one when $b>14$ fm.
The mass-TKE distribution in central collisions due to the competition is quite
different from those in peripheral collisions and the distribution of total

noise (AWGN) energy-harvesting (EH) channel with an infinite battery. The EH
process is characterized by a sequence of blocks of harvested energy, which is
known causally at the source. The harvested energy remains constant within a
block while the harvested energy across different blocks is characterized by a
sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.
The blocks have length $L$, which can be interpreted as the coherence time of
the energy arrival process. If $L$ is a constant or grows sublinearly in the
blocklength $n$, we fully characterize the first-order term in the asymptotic
expansion of the maximum transmission rate subject to a fixed tolerable error
probability $\varepsilon$. The first-order term is known as the
$\varepsilon$-capacity. In addition, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the
second-order term in the asymptotic expansion, which reveal that the second
order term scales as $\sqrt{\frac{L}{n}}$ for any $\varepsilon$ less than
$1/2$. The lower bound is obtained through analyzing the save-and-transmit
strategy. If $L$ grows linearly in $n$, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the
$\varepsilon$-capacity, which coincide whenever the cumulative distribution
function (cdf) of the EH random variable is continuous and strictly increasing.
In order to achieve the lower bound, we have proposed a novel adaptive
save-and-transmit strategy, which chooses different save-and-transmit codes
across different blocks according to the energy variation across the blocks.

massive hydrogen envelope ($M_\mathrm{H,env} > 0.15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$). SN Ib
progenitors are predominantly produced by early Case B mass transfer. Our
models predict that SN IIb progenitors are systematically more luminous in the
optical ($-8.0 \lesssim M_\mathrm{V} \lesssim -5.0$) than the majority of SN Ib

progenitor with a final mass of $\sim 3.0~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The event rate of
blue and yellow SN IIb progenitors would increase as metallicity decreases,
while the event rate of SN Ib progenitors would decrease instead. By contrast,
the population of RSG SN IIb progenitors would not be significantly affected by

stylization. Second, we improve diversity by introducing a new learning
formulation that encourages generators to sample unbiasedly from the Julesz

certain filter responses. Together, these two improvements take feed forward

promising accuracy with a modest privacy budget, and the second solution yields
better accuracy if the sampling asymptotically converges. We also compare our

  visual receptive fields","41 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The affine Gaussian derivative model can in several respects be regarded as a
canonical model for receptive fields over a spatial image domain: (i) it can be
derived by necessity from scale-space axioms that reflect structural properties
of the world, (ii) it constitutes an excellent model for the receptive fields
of simple cells in the primary visual cortex and (iii) it is covariant under
affine image deformations, which enables more accurate modelling of image
measurements under the local image deformations caused by the perspective
mapping, compared to the more commonly used Gaussian derivative model based on
derivatives of the rotationally symmetric Gaussian kernel.
  This paper presents a theory for discretizing the affine Gaussian scale-space
concept underlying the affine Gaussian derivative model, so that scale-space
properties hold also for the discrete implementation.
  Two ways of discretizing spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels are
presented: (i) by solving semi-discretized affine diffusion equation, which has
derived by necessity from the requirements of a semi-group structure over scale
as parameterized by a family of spatial covariance matrices and obeying
non-creation of new structures from any finer to any coarser scale in terms of
non-enhancement of local extrema and (ii) approximating these semi-discrete
affine receptive fields by parameterized families of 3x3-kernels as obtained
from an additional discretization along the scale direction. The latter
discrete approach can be optionally complemented by spatial subsampling at
coarser scales, leading to the notion of affine hybrid pyramids.
  Using these theoretical results, we outline hybrid architectures for discrete
approximations of affine covariant receptive field families, to be used as a
first processing layer for affine covariant and affine invariant visual
operations at higher levels.

important to understand the network structure itself in the absence of
infection. In this text we consider dynamic network models that are inspired by
the (static) configuration network. The networks are described by
population-level averages such as the fraction of the population with $k$
partners, $k=0,1,2,\ldots$ This means that the bookkeeping contains information
about individuals and their partners, but no information about partners of
partners. Can we average over the population to obtain information about
partners of partners? The answer is `it depends', and this is where the mean
field at distance one assumption comes into play. In this text we explain that,
yes, we may average over the population (in the right way) in the static
network. Moreover, we provide evidence in support of a positive answer for the
network model that is dynamic due to partnership changes. If, however, we
additionally allow for demographic changes, dependencies between partners
arise. In earlier work we used the slogan `mean field at distance one' as a
justification of simply ignoring the dependencies. Here we discuss the
subtleties that come with the mean field at distance one assumption, especially
when demography is involved. Particular attention is given to the accuracy of
the approximation in the setting with demography. Next, the mean field at
distance one assumption is discussed in the context of an infection
superimposed on the network. We end with the conjecture that an extension of
the bookkeeping leads to an exact description of the network structure.

quantities that most radically affect the onset of gravitational instabilities
in galaxy discs, and the quantity that is most drastically approximated in
stability analyses. Here we analyse the stability of a large sample of nearby
star-forming spirals treating molecular gas, atomic gas and stars as three
distinct components, and using radial profiles of sigma_CO and sigma_HI derived
from HERACLES and THINGS observations. We show that the radial variations of
sigma_CO and sigma_HI have a weak effect on the local stability level of galaxy
discs, which remains remarkably flat and well above unity, but is low enough to
ensure (marginal) instability against non-axisymmetric perturbations and gas
dissipation. More importantly, the radial variation of sigma_CO has a strong
impact on the size of the regions over which gravitational instabilities
develop, and results in a characteristic instability scale that is one order of
magnitude larger than the Toomre length of molecular gas. Disc instabilities
are driven, in fact, by the self-gravity of stars at kpc scales. This is true
across the entire optical disc of every galaxy in the sample, with few
exceptions. In the linear phase of the disc instability process, stars and
molecular gas are strongly coupled, and it is such a coupling that ultimately
triggers local gravitational collapse/fragmentation in the molecular gas.

particular central regions of our Galaxy have been studied searching for
point-like objects, for extended regions of emission, and for signal from
transient objects selected through multi-messenger observations. For the first
time, cascade events are used for these searches.
  ANTARES has also provided results on searches for hypothetical particles
(such as magnetic monopoles and nuclearites in the cosmic radiation), and
multi-messenger studies of the sky in combination with various detectors. Of

classical scale invariance, which is broken by chiral symmetry breaking and
confinement in a new strongly-coupled gauge theory that resembles QCD. The
Standard Model Higgs field emerges as a result of the mixing of a scalar meson
in the new strong dynamics and a massless elementary scalar field. The mass and
scalar decay constant of that scalar meson, which are generated dynamically in
the new gauge theory, give rise to the Higgs field mass term, automatically
possessing the correct negative sign by the bosonic seesaw mechanism. Using
analogy with QCD, we evaluate the dynamical scale of the new gauge theory and
further make quantitative predictions for light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons
associated with axial symmetry breaking along chiral symmetry breaking in the
new gauge theory. A prominent consequence of the scenario is that there should
be a Standard Model gauge singlet pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with mass below
220GeV, which couples to two electroweak gauge bosons through the
Wess-Zumino-Witten term, whose strength is thus determined by the dynamical
scale of the new gauge theory. Other pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, charged
under the electroweak gauge groups, also appear. Concerning the theoretical
aspects, it is shown that the scalar quartic coupling can vanish at the Planck
scale with the top quark pole mass as large as 172.5GeV, realizing the flatland
scenario without being in tension with the current experimental data.

users the ability to connect to their expected networks anytime, anywhere. This
leads to an increment of the number of wireless interfaces integrated into a
single mobile device, hence, it allows the device to be able to connect to
multiple access networks. However, in some specific cases such as natural
disasters, having an uncorrupted and timely information exchanging means is
critical for affected victims to survive or to connect to the outside world.
This is because the essential network infrastructures in these cases could be
destroyed causing a large number of systems to stop working. In that cases, the
victims need a heterogeneous communications network in which they can
communicate, without a doubt, by using different wireless access technologies,
i.e., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The network must also be able to smoothly change the
access technologies, or called a vertical handover, to ensure QoS for ongoing
applications. In addition, the network must have a mechanism to save energy.
For hese reasons, an SDN approach, which has been proposed in a previous work,
is considered. The performance of the system has been validated by a set of
experiments in a real testbed. The obtained results show that the proposed
vertical handover can save at least 24.42 per cent of the energy consumed by
the wireless communication. The handover delay with different UDP traffic is
less than 150ms. Moreover, the network allows a device using Bluetooth to talk
with another one using Wi-Fi over a heterogeneous connection where the
end-to-end jitter is mainly below 20ms and the packet loss rate is as small as
0.2 per cent.

destroyed possibly by its interaction with preexisting structures in the active

the difficulty in acquisition and maintenance of ontologies and semantic
annotations. On the other hand, the Internet explosion and the massive
diffusion of mobile smart devices lead to the creation of a worldwide system,
which information is daily checked and fueled by the contribution of millions
of users who interacts in a collaborative way. Search engines, continually
exploring the Web, are a natural source of information on which to base a
modern approach to semantic annotation. A promising idea is that it is possible
to generalize the semantic similarity, under the assumption that semantically
similar terms behave similarly, and define collaborative proximity measures
based on the indexing information returned by search engines. The PMING
Distance is a proximity measure used in data mining and information retrieval,
which collaborative information express the degree of relationship between two
terms, using only the number of documents returned as result for a query on a
search engine. In this work, the PMINIG Distance is updated, providing a novel
formal algebraic definition, which corrects previous works. The novel point of
view underlines the features of the PMING to be a locally normalized linear
combination of the Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalized Google Distance.
The analyzed measure dynamically reflects the collaborative change made on the
web resources.

be probed by studying the diffuse neutrino intensity. We aim at constraining
$F_{\rm max}$ by adopting a broken power-law flux distribution, a hypothesis
supported by observed properties of any generic astrophysical sources. The
first estimate of $F_{\rm max}$ comes from the fact that we can only observe
one universe, and hence, the expected number of sources above $F_{\rm max}$
cannot be too small compared with one. For abundant source classes such as
starburst galaxies, this one-source constraint yields a value of $F_{\rm max}$
that is an order of magnitude lower than the current upper limits from
point-source searches. Then we derive upper limits on $F_{\rm max}$ assuming
that the angular power spectrum is consistent with neutrino shot noise yet. We
find that the limits obtained with upgoing muon neutrinos in IceCube can
already be quite competitive, especially for rare but bright source populations
such as blazars. The limits will improve nearly quadratically with exposure,
and therefore be even more powerful for the next generation of neutrino
telescopes.

recently introduced Implicit B-Splines (IBS). The rich discriminative
information provided by the scale-variant HoCP features is leveraged during
inference. An automatic variable size part extraction framework iteratively
refines the object's initial pose that is roughly aligned due to the extraction
of coarsest parts, the ones occupying the largest area in image pixels. The
iterative refinement is accomplished based on finer (smaller) parts that are
represented with more discriminative control point descriptors by using our
Iterative Hough Forest. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset

her moves to obtain a lookahead on her opponent's moves. We show that
determining the winner of delay games with winning conditions given by parity

games: lookahead can be traded for the quality of winning strategies and vice
versa. We determine the extent of this tradeoff. In particular, even the
smallest lookahead allows to improve the quality of an optimal strategy from
the worst possible value to almost the smallest possible one. Thus, the benefit
of introducing lookahead is twofold: not only does it allow the delaying player
to win games she would lose without, but lookahead also allows her to improve
the quality of her winning strategies in games she wins even without lookahead.

energy and momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean. The role exerted by
surface waves on this interchange is particularly enigmatic. Waves induce
turbulence in the upper ocean by breaking and through Langmuir circulations.
However, waves can directly inject energy into subsurface layers. This relates
to waves not being truly irrotational and therefore the induced orbital motion
being turbulent. The existence, extent and properties of this turbulent
oscillatory flow still remain uncertain. Here we present measurements of the
velocity field of oscillatory flows, which are induced by mechanically
generated random wave fields in a large scale experimental facility. Velocities
were recorded at a depth sufficiently far from the water surface to rule out
effects of wave breaking. We demonstrate that the spectral tail of the velocity
field follows a power-law scaling close to $\omega^{-5/3}$. The turbulent
behaviour is investigated via rigorous statistical analysis of the structure
functions to highlight the emergence of intermittency in oscillatory flows. The
results show that wave motion is turbulent and can contribute to ocean mixing.
By deepening of the mixed layer, wave induced motion affects cyclogenesis and
sediment resuspension.

(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction
feathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between
gas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface
densities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along

spurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback

result of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution

formation onset mechanism that can be solely associated to the presence of the

odd characteristic $p$. For a positive integer $m$ prime to $p$, let
$F=\mathbb{K}(x,y)$ be the transcendency degree $1$ function field defined by
$y^q+y=x^m+x^{-m}$. Let $t=x^{m(q-1)}$ and $H=\mathbb{K}(t)$. The extension
$F|H$ is a non-Galois extension. Let $K$ be the Galois closure of $F$ with
respect to $H$. By a result of Stichtenoth, $K$ has genus $g(K)=(qm-1)(q-1)$,
$p$-rank (Hasse-Witt invariant) $\gamma(K)=(q-1)^2$ and a
$\mathbb{K}$-automorphism group of order at least $2q^2m(q-1)$. In this paper
we prove that this subgroup is the full $\mathbb{K}$-automorphism group of $K$;
more precisely $Aut_{\mathbb {K}}(K)=Q\rtimes D$ where $Q$ is an elementary
abelian $p$-group of order $q^2$ and $D$ has a index $2$ cyclic subgroup of
order $m(q-1)$. In particular, $\sqrt{m}|Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|> g(K)^{3/2}$, and
if $K$ is ordinary (i.e. $g(K)=\gamma(K)$) then
$|Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|>g^{3/2}$. On the other hand, if $G$ is a solvable
subgroup of the $\mathbb{K}$-automorphism group of an ordinary, transcendency
degree $1$ function field $L$ of genus $g(L)\geq 2$ defined over $\mathbb{K}$,
then by a result due to Korchm\'aros and Montanucci, $|Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|\le
34 (g(L)+1)^{3/2}<68\sqrt{2}g(L)^{3/2}$. This shows that $K$ hits this bound up
to the constant $68\sqrt{2}$.
  Since $Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)$ has several subgroups, the fixed subfield $F^N$
of such a subgroup $N$ may happen to have many automorphisms provided that the
normalizer of $N$ in $Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)$ is large enough. This possibility is
worked out for subgroups of $Q$.

data warehouse models have been proposed during past years in order to handle
hetero-geneity and complexity of multidimensional data in a way traditional
relational data warehouse approaches fail to achieve. However, XML-native
database systems currently suffer from limited performance, both in terms of
volumes of manageable data and query response time. Therefore , recent research
efforts are focusing the attention on fragmentation techniques, which are able
to overcome the limitations above. Derived horizontal fragmentation is already
used in relational data warehouses, and can definitely be adapted to the XML
context. However, classical fragmentation algorithms are not suitable to
control the number of originated fragments, which instead plays a critical role
in data warehouses, and, with more emphasis, distributed data warehouse
architectures. Inspired by this research challenge, in this paper we propose
the use of K-means clustering algorithm for effectively and efficiently
supporting the fragmentation of very large XML data warehouses, and, at the
same time, completely controlling and determining the number of originated
fragments via adequately setting the parameter K. We complete our analytical
contribution by means of a comprehensive experimental assessment where we
compare the efficiency of our proposed XML data warehouse fragmentation

active power coordination of different priority loads is formulated as an

converted rapidly to the kinetic energy of non-thermal particles and bulk
plasma motion. This will likely result in non-equilibrium particle
distributions and turbulent plasma conditions. We investigate this by analysing
the profiles of high-temperature extreme ultraviolet emission lines from a
major flare (SOL2014-03-29T17:44) observed by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer
(EIS) on Hinode. We find that in many locations the line profiles are
non-Gaussian, consistent with a kappa-distribution of emitting ions with
properties that vary in space and time. At the flare footpoints, close to sites
of hard X-ray emission from non-thermal electrons, the kappa-index for the Fe
XVI 262.976 angstrom line at 3 MK takes values of 3-5. In the corona, close to
a low-energy HXR source, the Fe XXIII 263.760 angstrom line at 15 MK shows
kappa values of typically 4-7. The observed trends in the kappa parameter show
that we are most likely detecting the properties of the ion population rather
than any instrumental effects. We calculate that a non-thermal ion population
could exist if locally accelerated on timescales < 0.1 s. However, observations
of net redshifts in the lines also imply the presence of plasma downflows which
could lead to bulk turbulence, with increased non-Gaussianity in cooler
regions. Both interpretations have important implications for theories of solar
flare particle acceleration.

confinement experiment is fundamental in order to make nuclear fusion a
reliable source of energy. The development of a set of equations describing the
plasma evolution on a given time scale is the main requirement to reach this
goal. A limited amount of works have studied in a self-consistent way
collisional transport and fluctuation induced transport. The motivation of this
work stems from the fundamental importance of the self-consistency of the
adopted description in order to understand transport processes on the energy
confinement (transport) time scale because of the mutual interaction between
collisions and turbulence. In turn, this is crucial in order to predict fluxes
of particle and energy and, ultimately, the overall plasma evolution. Using
flux coordinates and the drift ordering we derive a set of evolutions equations
for the number of particles and the energy density on the transport time scale.
These equations show the interplay between collisions and fluctuations and, in
particular, show that fluctuations may enhance collisional transport while the
collisions can damp long lived structures formed by saturated instabilities,
i.e zonal structures. Fluctuation induced fluxes are described using
gyrokinetic field theory, which makes a comparison with the theory of phase
space zonal structures possible, revealing that the fluctuations induced part
of the transport equations can be obtained by taking the proper moment of the
long length scale limit of the equation governing the evolution of phase space
zonal structures. Finally, we show that plasma nonlinear evolution can yield to
structures formation that are characterized by mesoscales, intermediate between
the typical ones of plasma turbulence and those of the reference plasma
equilibrium.

comprising of different ${SU(2)_L}$ multiplets. If the extended scalar sector
participates in the electroweak symmetry breaking then these extra scalars need
to couple with the known standard model particles. In this work, it has been
shown that the vector boson scattering involving scalar boson exchanges provide
a complimentary way to direct search methods to probe into the scalar sector.
As different extended scalar sectors have similar types of scalar fields, e.g.,
an extra $CP$-even Higgs, charged Higgs etc., these new physics models can give
rise to the similar types of experimental signatures. It is possible to
distinguish between such models at various vector boson scattering processes by
looking at the resonances. Also, the shapes of the resonances can provide
further insight to the relevant parameter space of these models.
  As in the SM, the electroweak vacuum is metastable, it is important to
explore if an extended scalar has an answer in its reserve. As the scalar
weakly interacting massive scalar particles protected by $Z_2$ symmetry can
serve as viable dark matter candidates, it is interesting to explore if they
help prolong the lifetime of the Universe. The effective Higgs potential gets
modified in the presence of these new extra scalars, improving the stability of
electroweak vacuum. Such an exercise has been undertaken in various kinds of
extended scalar sectors. In order to show the explicit dependence of the
electroweak stability on different parameters of these extended sectors,
various kinds of phase diagrams have been presented. Graphical demonstrations
have been provided to illustrate how the confidence level, at which stability
of electroweak vacuum is excluded, depends on such new physics parameters.

state hit probability under a stationary request process does not account for
performance loss under a variable request arrival process. In this work, we
consider adaptability of caching algorithms from two perspectives: (a) the
accuracy of learning a fixed popularity distribution, and (b) the speed of
learning items' popularity. In order to attain this goal, we compute the
distance between the stationary distributions of several popular algorithms
with that of a genie-aided algorithm that has knowledge of the true popularity
ranking, which we use as a measure of learning accuracy. We then characterize
the mixing time of each algorithm, i.e., the time needed to attain the
stationary distribution, which we use as a measure of learning efficiency. We
merge both measures above to obtain the ""learning error"" representing both how
quickly and how accurately an algorithm learns the optimal caching
distribution, and use this to determine the trade-off between these two
objectives of many popular caching algorithms. Informed by the results of our
analysis, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm, Adaptive-LRU (A-LRU), that
learns both faster and better the changes in the popularity. We show
numerically that it also outperforms all other candidate algorithms when
confronted with either a dynamically changing synthetic request process or

dimension-six operator that explains an experimental excess in direct detection
is assumed to drive decoupling at freeze-out, and apply them to the
proton-philic Spin-dependent Inelastic Dark Matter (pSIDM) scenario, a
phenomenological set-up containing two states $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ with
$m_{\chi_2}>m_{\chi_1}$ that we have shown in a previous paper to explain the
DAMA effect in compliance with the constraints from other detectors. We update
experimental constraints on pSIDM, extend the analysis to the most general
spin-dependent momentum-dependent interactions allowed by non-relativistic
Effective Field Theory (EFT), and consider for the WIMP velocity distribution
in our Galaxy both a halo-independent approach and a standard Maxwellian. The
problem of calculating the relic abundance by using direct detection data to
fix the model parameters is affected by a strong sensitivity on $f(v)$ and by
the degeneracy between the WIMP local density and the WIMP-nucleon scattering
cross section. As a consequence, a DM direct detection experiment is not
directly sensitive to the physical cut-off scale of the EFT, but on some
dimensional combination that does not depend on the actual value of the relic
abundance. However, such degeneracy can be used to develop a consistency test
on the possibility that the WIMP is a thermal relic in the first place. When we
apply it to the pSIDM scenario we find that only a WIMP with a standard
spin-dependent interaction ${\cal O}_{spin}$ with quarks can be a thermal
relic, for a galactic velocity distribution that departs from a Maxwellian.
However all the $\chi_2$ states must have already decayed today, and this
requires some additional mechanism besides that provided by the ${\cal
O}_{spin}$ operator.

in theory, for the solution of a two-dimensional elliptic equation with
strongly anisotropic diffusion coefficients along different directions, subject
to the Neumann boundary condition and the Dirichlet boundary condition on
specific parts of the domain boundary, respectively. The ill-posedness arising
from the Neumann boundary condition in the strongly anisotropic diffusion limit
is handled by the decomposition of the solution into a mean part and a
fluctuation part. The boundary layer analysis due to the Dirichlet boundary
condition is conducted for each order in the expansion for the fluctuation
part. Our results suggest that the leading order is the combination of the mean

metamaterials whose dispersion and propagation properties results from the use
of geometric inhomogeneities in the form of Acoustic Black Holes (ABH). The ABH
is an element able to smoothly bend and slow down elastic waves, therefore
providing a variety of unconventional dispersion and propagation properties
typically observed in more complex multi-material and locally resonant designs.
This approach enables thin-walled structural elements having fully embedded
acoustic lenses capable of different functionalities such as focusing,
collimation, and negative refraction. Numerical simulations show that such
structures exhibit broadband operating conditions that span both the
metamaterial and the phononic range. Full field experimental measurements allow
validating the design approach and confirm the performance of the embedded
acoustic lens.

hypotheses about characteristic scales in signals, it is essential that the
selected scale levels reflect the extent of the underlying structures in the
signal.
  This paper presents a theory and in-depth theoretical analysis about the
scale selection properties of methods for automatically selecting local
temporal scales in time-dependent signals based on local extrema over temporal
scales of scale-normalized temporal derivative responses. Specifically, this
paper develops a novel theoretical framework for performing such temporal scale
selection over a time-causal and time-recursive temporal domain as is necessary
when processing continuous video or audio streams in real time or when
modelling biological perception.
  For a recently developed time-causal and time-recursive scale-space concept
defined by convolution with a scale-invariant limit kernel, we show that it is
possible to transfer a large number of the desirable scale selection properties
that hold for the Gaussian scale-space concept over a non-causal temporal
domain to this temporal scale-space concept over a truly time-causal domain.
Specifically, we show that for this temporal scale-space concept, it is
possible to achieve true temporal scale invariance although the temporal scale
levels have to be discrete, which is a novel theoretical construction.

film to a 'full' (one-dimensional) magnonic crystal. For this purpose, the
surface of a pre-patterned 36.8 nm thin permalloy film was sequentially ion
milled resulting in magnonic hybrid structures, referred to as
surface-modulated magnonic crystals, with increasing modulation depth. After
each etching step, ferromagnetic resonance measurements were performed yielding
the spin-wave resonance modes in backward-volume and Damon-Eshbach geometry.
The spin-wave spectra of these hybrid systems reveal an even larger variety of
spin-wave states compared to the 'full' magnonic crystal. The measurements are
corroborated by quasi-analytical theory and micromagnetic simulations in order
to study the changing spin-wave mode character employing spin-wave mode
profiles. In backward-volume geometry, a gradual transition from the uniform
mode in the film limit to a fundamental mode in the thin part of the magnonic
crystal was observed. Equivalently, the first and the second film modes are
transform into a center and an edge mode of the thick part of the magnonic
crystal. Simple transition rules from the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ film mode to the
$m^{\mathrm{th}}$ mode in the 'full' magnonic crystal are formulated unraveling
the complex mode structure particularly in the backward-volume geometry. An
analogous analysis was performed in the Damon-Eshbach geometry.

structure of an algebra, in which vector multiplication is ordinary
multiplication of wave functions. This algebra is finite-dimensional, with
exactly $N!^{d-1}$ generators for $N$ identical particles, bosons or fermions,
in $d$ dimensions. The generators are called shapes. Each shape is a possible
many-body vacuum. Shapes are natural generalizations of the ground-state Slater
determinant to more than one dimension. Physical states, including the ground
state, are superpositions of shapes with symmetric-function coefficients, for
both bosons and fermions. These symmetric functions may be interpreted as
bosonic excitations of the shapes. The algebraic structure of Hilbert space
described here provides qualitative insights into long-standing issues of
many-body physics, including the fermion sign problem and the microscopic
origin of bands in the spectra of finite systems.
