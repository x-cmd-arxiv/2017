the well-known prescribed $Q$-curvature problem asks whether or not there is a
metric $g$ comformal to $g_0$ such that its $Q$-curvature, associated with the
GJMS operator $\mathbf P_g$, is equal to a given function $f$. Letting $g =
e^{2u}g_0$, this problem is equivalent to solving \[ \mathbf P_{g_0} u+Q_{g_0}
= f e^{nu}, \] where $Q_{g_0}$ denotes the $Q$-curvature of $g_0$. The primary
objective of the paper is to introduce the following negative gradient flow of
the time dependent metric $g(t)$ conformal to $g_0$, \[ \frac{\partial g
(t)}{\partial t}= -2\Big(Q_{g (t)} - \frac{\int_M f Q_{g(t)} d\mu_{g(t)}

problem of prescribing $Q$-curvature. Since $\int_M Q_g d\mu_g$ is conformally
invariant, our analysis depends on the size of $\int_M Q_{g_0} d\mu_{g_0}$,
which is assumed to satisfy \[ \int_M Q_0 d\mu_{g_0} \ne k (n-1)! \, {\rm

twofold. First, we identify suitable conditions on $f$ such that the gradient
flow defined as above is defined to all time and convergent, as time goes to
infinity, sequentially or uniformly. Second, we show that various existence
theorems for prescribed $Q$-curvature problem can be derived from the
convergence of the flow.

linearity. The admissible CA observables and the existence of solutions of the

This compound lacks a long range order down to 37 mK, which is a temperature
5000-times lower than the magnetic interaction scale of around 200 K. Partial
substitution for Zn can continuously vary the magnetic ground state from an
antiferromagnetic order to a spin-gapped state through the liquid state. This
indicates that the spin-liquid state emerges from a delicate balance of inter-

role. This unique feature should realize a new type of quantum magnetism.

the specific target signature in advance. However, target signature are often
difficult or impossible to obtain. Furthermore, common methods for obtaining
target signatures, such as from laboratory measurements or manual selection
from an image scene, usually do not capture the discriminative features of
target class. In this paper, an approach for estimating a discriminative target
signature from imprecise labels is presented. The proposed approach maximizes
the response of the hybrid sub-pixel detector within a multiple instance
learning framework and estimates a set of discriminative target signatures.
After learning target signatures, any signature based detector can then be
applied on test data. Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection
experiments are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

preferred. In recent years, there has been much development for binary
classification with a reject option. Yet, little progress has been made for the
multicategory case. In this article, we propose margin-based multicategory
classification methods with a reject option. In addition, and more importantly,
we introduce a new and unique refine option for the multicategory problem,
where the class of an observation is predicted to be from a set of class
labels, whose cardinality is not necessarily one. The main advantage of both
options lies in their capacity of identifying error-prone observations.
Moreover, the refine option can provide more constructive information for
classification by effectively ruling out implausible classes. Efficient
implementations have been developed for the proposed methods. On the
theoretical side, we offer a novel statistical learning theory and show a fast
convergence rate of the excess $\ell$-risk of our methods with emphasis on
diverging dimensionality and number of classes. The results can be further
improved under a low noise assumption. A set of comprehensive simulation and

electronics from its beginnings. Although their properties can be well
represented transport model equations, design and analysis approaches have, to
a good extent, been limited to using current-equispaced horizontal and parallel
isolines of the characteristic surface. Here, we resort to the geometrical
structure imposed on BJTs behavior by the Early effect and voltage as a means
to derive a simple, intuitive and more complete respective model that, though
excluding cut-off and saturation regimes, can simplify the design and
characterization of BJTs and respective circuits, including integrated devices.
The approach involves using a beam of isolines converging at the Early voltage
as the model of a BJT. The angles of the isolines, another important aspect of
BJTs, are experimentally verified often to vary almost in linear fashion with
the base current, endowing the proposed Early model with an intrinsic geometric
nature. An experimental-numerical methodology is suggested for the Early model
estimation, and applied to 12 real-world small signal NPN BJTs. Interesting
results are obtained, including the identification of diverse Early voltage

varying degrees of accuracy. Our pipeline uses a linear mixture (Generalized
Least Squares) solution for component separation, and a hybrid approach for
power spectrum estimation, with a Quadratic Maximum Likelihood estimator at low
$\ell$s and a pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ deconvolution at high $\ell$s. In the
likelihood for $r$, we explore modelling foreground residuals as nuisance
parameters. Our analysis aims at measuring the bias introduced in $r$ by
mismodelling the foregrounds, and to determine what error is tolerable while
still successfully detecting $r$. We find that $r=0.01$ can be measured
successfully even for a complex sky model and in the presence of foreground
parameters error. However, the detection of $r=0.001$ is a lot more
challenging, as inaccurate modelling of the foreground spectral properties may
result in a biased measurement of $r$. Once biases are eliminated, the total
error on $r$ allows setting an upper limit rather than a detection, unless the
uncertainties on the foreground spectral indices are very small, i.e. equal or
better than 0.5\% error for both dust and synchrotron. This emphasizes the need
for pursuing research on component separation and foreground characterization
in view of next-generation CMB polarization experiments.

resolution, and can be carried out with photoswitchable fluorophores for
multi-component discrimination, to determine the stoichiometry, affinity, and
shape of macromolecular complexes with dissociation equilibrium constants from
picomolar to micromolar. A popular approach for data interpretation is the
determination of the binding affinity by isotherms of weight-average
sedimentation coefficients, sw. A prevailing dogma in sedimentation analysis is
that the weight-average sedimentation coefficient from the transport method
corresponds to the signal- and population-weighted average of all species. We
show that this does not always hold true for systems that exhibit significant
signal changes with complex formation - properties that may be readily
encountered in practice, e.g., from a change in fluorescence quantum yield.
Coupled transport in the reaction boundary of rapidly reversible systems can
make significant contributions to the observed migration in a way that cannot
be accounted for in the standard population-based average. Effective particle
theory provides a simple physical picture for the reaction-coupled migration
process. On this basis we develop a more general binding model that converges
to the well-known form of sw with constant signals, but can account
simultaneously for hydrodynamic co-transport in the presence of changes in
fluorescence quantum yield. We believe this will be useful when studying
interacting systems exhibiting fluorescence quenching, enhancement or Forster
resonance energy transfer with transport methods.

calculation of $\alpha$-induced reaction cross sections at low energies in the
statistical model. Uncertainties of these calculations are related to
ambiguities in the adjustment of the potential parameters to experimental
elastic scattering angular distributions (typically at higher energies) and to
the energy dependence of the effective $\alpha$-nucleus potentials.
  Purpose The present work studies cross sections of $\alpha$-induced reactions
for $^{64}$Zn at low energies and their dependence on the chosen input
parameters of the statistical model calculations. The new experimental data
from the recent Atomki experiments allow for a $\chi^2$-based estimate of the
uncertainties of calculated cross sections at very low energies.
  Method The recent data for the ($\alpha$,$\gamma$), ($\alpha$,$n$), and
($\alpha$,$p$) reactions on $^{64}$Zn are compared to calculations in the
statistical model. A survey of the parameter space of the widely used computer
code TALYS is given, and the properties of the obtained $\chi^2$ landscape are
discussed.
  Results The best fit to the experimental data at low energies shows $\chi^2/F
\approx 7.7$ per data point which corresponds to an average deviation of about
30% between the best fit and the experimental data. Several combinations of the
various ingredients of the statistical model are able to reach a reasonably
small $\chi^2/F$, not exceeding the best-fit result by more than a factor of 2.
  Conclusions The present experimental data for $^{64}$Zn in combination with
the statistical model calculations allow to constrain the astrophysical
reaction rate within about a factor of 2. However, the significant excess of
$\chi^2/F$ of the best-fit from unity asks for further improvement of the
statistical model calculations and in particular the $\alpha$-nucleus
potential.

or functions, and a basic challenge is to show separations of complexity
classes $A \not= B$ especially when $A$ is known to be a subset of $B$. In this
paper we introduce a homological theory of functions that can be used to
establish complexity separations, while also providing other interesting
consequences. We propose to associate a topological space $S_A$ to each class
of functions $A$, such that, to separate complexity classes $A \subseteq B'$,
it suffices to observe a change in ""the number of holes"", i.e. homology, in
$S_A$ as a subclass $B$ of $B'$ is added to $A$. In other words, if the
homologies of $S_A$ and $S_{A \cup B}$ are different, then $A \not= B'$. We
develop the underlying theory of functions based on combinatorial and
homological commutative algebra and Stanley-Reisner theory, and recover Minsky
and Papert's 1969 result that parity cannot be computed by nonmaximal degree
polynomial threshold functions. In the process, we derive a ""maximal principle""
for polynomial threshold functions that is used to extend this result further
to arbitrary symmetric functions. A surprising coincidence is demonstrated,
where the maximal dimension of ""holes"" in $S_A$ upper bounds the VC dimension
of $A$, with equality for common computational cases such as the class of
polynomial threshold functions or the class of linear functionals in $\mathbb
F_2$, or common algebraic cases such as when the Stanley-Reisner ring of $S_A$
is Cohen-Macaulay. As another interesting application of our theory, we prove a
result that a priori has nothing to do with complexity separation: it
characterizes when a vector subspace intersects the positive cone, in terms of
homological conditions. By analogy to Farkas' result doing the same with
*linear conditions*, we call our theorem the Homological Farkas Lemma.

conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and
on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores
short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the
majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85% of the cumulative SFHs are
fitted to within a maximum error of 5% of the total stellar mass formed, and
99% to within 10%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the
commonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more
than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were
rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the log-normal parameter
space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find
that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though
Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of
log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of
Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts
their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not
determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight
relation, where $\mathrm{width}\propto\mathrm{(peak\ time)}^{3/2}$. We show
that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively)
by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their
galaxies.

observed variability in the coronal properties is driven by a variable optical
depth. A constant heating to cooling ratio is measured implying that there is a

metallicity determined from the host galaxy photometry and spectroscopy up to z

galaxies in the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relation plane. We
find that although LGRBs also form in galaxies with relatively large stellar
masses, the large majority of host galaxies have metallicities below
log(O=H)~8.6. The extension to z = 2 results in a good sampling of stellar
masses also above Log(Mstar/Msun)~9.5 and provides evidence that LGRB host
galaxies do not follow the fundamental metallicity relation. As shown by the
comparison with dedicated numerical simulations of LGRB host galaxy population,
these results are naturally explained by the existence of a mild (~0.7 Zsun)
threshold for the LGRB formation. The present statistics does not allow us to
discriminate between different shapes of the metallicity cutoff, but the
relatively high metallicity threshold found in this work is somewhat in
disagreement to most of the standard single-star models for LGRB progenitors.

The $n_i$'s take value in the interval $[2,q]$ and may be regarded as $S_z$
eigenvalues in the spin representation $j = (q-2)/2$. The distinctive
interaction of the model is based on the coprimality matrix $\bf \Phi$: for the
ferromagnetic case, this matrix assigns lower energy to configurations where
occupation numbers $n_i$ and $n_{i+1}$ of neighbouring sites share a common
divisor, while for the anti-ferromagnetic case it assigns lower energy to
configurations where $n_i$ and $n_{i+1}$ are coprime. The coprime chain, both

ground states whose values can be exactly computed by means of graph
theoretical tools. In the ferromagnetic case there are generally also
frustration phenomena. A fine tuning of local operators may lift the
exponential ground state degeneracy and, according to which operators are

promise of novel, low power, ultrafast electronics, but the relative roles of

understanding difficult to obtain. Here we point out that existing data on
tuning of the MIT in perovskite transition metal oxides through ionic size
effects provides evidence of systematic and large effects on the phase
transition due to dynamical fluctuations of the elastic strain, which have been
usually neglected. This is illustrated by a simple yet quantitative statistical
mechanical calculation in a model that incorporates cooperative lattice
distortions coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom. We reproduce the
observed dependence of the transition temperature on cation radius in the
well-studied manganite and nickelate materials. Since the elastic couplings are

quiescence at the time of our observations, it showed a strong optical flaring
activity, more pronounced at higher frequencies (i.e. the g band). Once the
flares were subtracted, we tentatively recovered a sinusoidal modulation at the
system orbital period in all bands, even if a significant phase shift with
respect to an irradiated star, typical of accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars
is detected. We conclude that the observed flaring could be a manifestation of
the presence of an accretion disc in the system. The observed light curve
variability could be explained by the presence of a superhump, which might be
another proof of the formation of an accretion disc. In particular, the disc at
the time of our observations was probably preparing to the new outburst of the

stable r-process nuclei such as Eu. These two types of nuclei can be associated
with one r-process event and cumulation of events till formation of the solar
system, respectively. With help of the observed local star formation history,
we deduce the chemical evolution of 244Pu and obtain three main results: (i)
the last r-process event occurred 130-140 Myr before formation of the solar
system, (ii) the present-day low 244Pu abundance as measured in deep sea
reservoirs results from the low recent star formation rate compared to ~4.5 - 5
Gyr ago, and (iii) there were ~15 r-process events in the solar vicinity from
formation of the Galaxy to the time of solar system formation and ~30 r-process
events to the present time. Then, adopting a reasonable hypothesis that a
neutron star merger is the r-process production site, we find that the ejected
r-process elements are extensively spread out and mixed with interstellar
matter with a mass of ~3.5 million solar masses, which is about 100 times
larger than that for supernova ejecta. In addition, the event frequency of
r-process production is estimated to be one per about 1400 core-collapse

applying two cycles of a particular parallel method. Here $S(A)$ stands for the

Further monitoring by Swift began to uncover the enormity of the outburst,
which peaked at 1.2 x 10^39 erg/s on 2016 August 25 (MJD 57625). The system
then began a gradual decline in flux that was still continuing over 5 months

account the complex accretion changes over the outburst, to solve for the
orbital parameters. Our results show SMC X-3 to be a system with a moderately
low eccentricity amongst the Be/X-ray binary systems and to have a dynamically
determined orbital period statistically consistent with the prominent period
measured in the OGLE optical light curve. Our optical and X-ray derived
ephemerides show that the peak in optical flux occurs roughly 6 days after
periastron. The measured increase in I-band flux from the counterpart during
the outburst is reflected in the measured equivalent width of the H-alpha line
emission, though the H-alpha emission itself seems variable on sub-day
time-scales, possibly due to the NS interacting with an inhomogeneous disc.

  Method: We conducted an empirical case study of energy consumption by two
MySQL database engines, InnoDB and MyISAM, across 40 releases. We examined the
relationships of four software metrics to energy consumption and execution time

technique implements large eddy simulation, discrete phase simulation, a

is such that the computational costs scale linearly with the number of
particles present in the computational domain. On detection of a collision,
particle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision kinetic energy,
restitution coefficient and the van der Waals' interactions. The performance of
the technique developed is tested by performing parametric studies of the
influence the restitution coefficient $(e_{n} = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6$ and $0.8)$,
particle size ($d_p = 60, 120, 200$ and $316 \mu{m}$), fluid inertia

particle-particle interaction events (collision and agglomeration). The results
demonstrate that the collision frequency shows a linear dependency on the
restitution coefficient, while the agglomeration rate shows an inverse
dependence. Collisions among smaller particles are more frequent and efficient
in forming agglomerates than those of coarser particles. The particle-particle
interaction events show a strong dependency on the shear Reynolds number
$Re_{\tau}$, while increasing the particle concentration effectively enhances
particle collision and agglomeration. Overall, the sensitivity of the

constraining the characteristic mass ($m_c$) and width ($\sigma$) of a
lognormal sub-solar initial mass function (IMF) in Local Group dwarf galaxies
using direct star counts. For a typical Milky Way (MW) satellite ($M_{V} =
-8$), jointly constraining $m_c$ and $\sigma$ to a precision of $\lesssim 20\%$
requires that observations be complete to $\lesssim 0.2 M_{\odot}$, if the IMF
is similar to the MW IMF. A similar statistical precision can be obtained if
observations are only complete down to $0.4M_{\odot}$, but this requires
measurement of nearly 100$\times$ more stars, and thus, a significantly more
massive satellite ($M_{V} \sim -12$). In the absence of sufficiently deep data
to constrain the low-mass turnover, it is common practice to fit a
single-sloped power law to the low-mass IMF, or to fit $m_c$ for a lognormal
while holding $\sigma$ fixed. We show that the former approximation leads to
best-fit power law slopes that vary with the mass range observed and can
largely explain existing claims of low-mass IMF variations in MW satellites,
even if satellite galaxies have the same IMF as the MW. In addition, fixing
$\sigma$ during fitting leads to substantially underestimated uncertainties in
the recovered value of $m_c$ (by a factor of $\sim 4$ for typical
observations). If the IMFs of nearby dwarf galaxies are lognormal and do vary,
observations must reach down to $\sim m_c$ in order to robustly detect these
variations. The high-sensitivity, near-infrared capabilities of JWST and WFIRST
have the potential to dramatically improve constraints on the low-mass IMF. We
present an efficient observational strategy for using these facilities to
measure the IMFs of Local Group dwarf galaxies.

thermodynamics and the entropy of an extremal rotating thin shell, i.e., an
extremal rotating ring, are investigated. The outer and inner regions are taken
to be the Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelbom-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime and the vacuum ground
state anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, respectively. By applying the first law
of thermodynamics to the extremal shell one shows that its entropy is an
arbitrary function of the gravitational area $A_+$ alone, $S=S(A_+)$. When the
shell approaches its own gravitational radius $r_+$ and turns into an extremal
rotating BTZ black hole, it is found that the entropy of the spacetime remains
such a function of $A_+$. It is thus vindicated, that extremal black holes,
here extremal BTZ black holes, have different properties from the corresponding
nonextremal black holes, which have the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S(A_+)=
\frac{A_+}{4G}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. It is argued that for
the extremal case $0\leq S(A_+)\leq \frac{A_+}{4G}$. Thus, rather than having
just two entropies for extremal black holes, as previous results debated, 0 and
$\frac{A_+}{4G}$, it is shown that extremal black holes may have a continuous
range of entropies, limited by precisely those two entropies. Surely, the
entropy that a particular extremal black hole picks must depend on past
processes, notably on how it was formed. It is also found a remarkable relation
between the third law of thermodynamics and the impossibility for a massive
body to reach the velocity of light. In the procedure, it becomes clear that
there are two distinct angular velocities for the shell, the mechanical and
thermodynamic angular velocities. In passing, we clarify, for a static
spacetime with a thermal shell, the meaning of the Tolman temperature formula
at a generic radius and at the shell. (Abridged version).

of constraining the angular momentum transport mechanism. We find that the

have a broad distribution extending from $10^{-4}$ to $0.04$. Moreover, they
correlate with neither the global disk parameters (mass, size, surface density)
nor the stellar characteristics (mass, luminosity, radius). However, we do find
a strong linear correlation between $\alpha$ and the central mass accretion
rate $\dot M$. This correlation is unlikely to result from the direct physical
effect of $\dot M$ on disk viscosity on global scales. Instead, we suggest that
it is caused by the decoupling of stellar $\dot M$ from the global disk
characteristics in one of the following ways. (1) The behavior (and range) of
$\alpha$ is controlled by a yet unidentified parameter (e.g. ionization
fraction, magnetic field strength, or geometry), ultimately driving the
variation of $\dot M$. (2) The central $\dot M$ is decoupled from the global
viscous mass accretion rate as a result of an instability or mass accumulation
(or loss) in the inner disk. (3) Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is
that angular momentum in protoplanetary disks is transported non-viscously,
e.g. via magnetohydrodynamic winds or spiral density waves.

approaches have shown remarkable abilities to discriminatively learn 2D

donor stars and relatively short orbital periods, of order one week to several
months may survive spiral in, to then form Wolf-Rayet (WR) X-ray binaries with
orbital periods of order a day to a few days; while in systems where the
compact star is a neutron star, HMXBs with these orbital periods never survive
spiral-in. We therefore predict that WR X-ray binaries can only harbor black
holes. The reason why black-hole HMXBs with these orbital periods may survive
spiral in is: the combination of a radiative envelope of the donor star, and a
high mass of the compact star. In this case, when the donor begins to overflow
its Roche lobe, the systems are able to spiral in slowly with stable Roche-lobe
overflow, as is shown by the system SS433. In this case the transferred mass is
ejected from the vicinity of the compact star (so-called ""isotropic
re-emission"" mass loss mode, or ""SS433-like mass loss""), leading to gradual
spiral-in. If the mass ratio of donor and black hole is $>3.5$, these systems
will go into CE evolution and are less likely to survive. If they survive, they
produce WR X-ray binaries with orbital periods of a few hours to one day.
  Several of the well-known WR+O binaries in our Galaxy and the Magellanic
Clouds, with orbital periods in the range between a week and several months,
are expected to evolve into close WR-Black-Hole binaries,which may later
produce close double black holes. The galactic formation rate of double black

  Semantic Segmentation",,"ICASSP 2017",,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Style transfer is an important task in which the style of a source image is
mapped onto that of a target image. The method is useful for synthesizing
derivative works of a particular artist or specific painting. This work
considers targeted style transfer, in which the style of a template image is
used to alter only part of a target image. For example, an artist may wish to
alter the style of only one particular object in a target image without
altering the object's general morphology or surroundings. This is useful, for
example, in augmented reality applications (such as the recently released
Pokemon GO), where one wants to alter the appearance of a single real-world
object in an image frame to make it appear as a cartoon. Most notably, the
rendering of real-world objects into cartoon characters has been used in a
number of films and television show, such as the upcoming series Son of Zorn.
We present a method for targeted style transfer that simultaneously segments
and stylizes single objects selected by the user. The method uses a Markov
random field model to smooth and anti-alias outlier pixels near object
boundaries, so that stylized objects naturally blend into their surroundings.

atmospheres of Solar System and exoplanetary terrestrial planets. Its parent
model, known as ModelE2 (Schmidt et al. 2014), is used to simulate modern and
21st Century Earth and near-term paleo-Earth climates. ROCKE-3D is an ongoing
effort to expand the capabilities of ModelE2 to handle a broader range of
atmospheric conditions including higher and lower atmospheric pressures, more
diverse chemistries and compositions, larger and smaller planet radii and
gravity, different rotation rates (slowly rotating to more rapidly rotating
than modern Earth, including synchronous rotation), diverse ocean and land
distributions and topographies, and potential basic biosphere functions. The
first aim of ROCKE-3D is to model planetary atmospheres on terrestrial worlds
within the Solar System such as paleo-Earth, modern and paleo-Mars,
paleo-Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. By validating the model for a broad range
of temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric constituents we can then expand its
capabilities further to those exoplanetary rocky worlds that have been
discovered in the past and those to be discovered in the future. We discuss the
current and near-future capabilities of ROCKE-3D as a community model for
studying planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres.

negative information can also propagate widely. When the cascades with
different opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first is the
most likely to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is
detected, a natural containment method is to introduce a positive cascade
competing against the rumor. Given a budget $k$, the rumor blocking problem
asks for $k$ seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that
the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The
prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated
within a factor of $(1-1/e-\delta)$ by a classic greedy algorithm combined with
Monte Carlo simulation with the running time of $O(\frac{k^3mn\ln
n}{\delta^2})$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of users and edges,
respectively. Unfortunately, the Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods are
extremely time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance
guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a
randomized algorithm which runs in $O(\frac{km\ln n}{\delta^2})$ expected time
and provides a $(1-1/e-\delta)$-approximation with a high probability. The
experimentally results on both the real-world and synthetic social networks

efficient than the state-of-the-art method and it is able to find the seed
nodes which are effective in limiting the spread of rumor.

varying human feedback parameters on task performance by investigating the

with which the agent incorporates human feedback has a significant impact on
task performance. We found that smearing human feedback over time steps
improves performance and we show varying the probability of feedback at each

revealed its coincidence with a dwarf host galaxy and a steady (`quiescent')
non-thermal radio source. We show that the properties of the host galaxy are
consistent with those of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) and
hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were
previously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of
newly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation
periods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario
whereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar
remnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements
on the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta
(accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula),
energetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the
quiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century.
The quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the
shock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the
surrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar
wind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow
from an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be
too young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time
derivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent
radio source. We propose future tests of the SLSNe-I/LGRB/FRB connection, such
as searches for FRBs from nearby SLSNe-I/LGRB on timescales of decades after
their explosions.

graph, with a given (irregular) degree distribution, the distributions of

size of the graph tends to infinity. We derive asymptotic upper and lower
bounds on the expected values of the Poisson distributions that are independent
of the size of the graph, and only depend on the degree distribution and the
cycle length. For a random lift of a bi-regular protograph, we prove that the
asymptotic cycle distributions are essentially the same as those of random
bipartite graphs as long as the degree distributions are identical. For random
QC-LDPC codes, however, we show that the cycle distribution can be quite
different from the other two categories. In particular, depending on the
protograph and the value of $c$, the expected number of cycles of length $c$,
in this case, can be either $\Theta(N)$ or $\Theta(1)$, where $N$ is the
lifting degree (code length). We also provide numerical results that match our

solution to finding all symmetrically unique configurations and displacements
is to generate the complete list of possible configurations and remove those
that are symmetrically equivalent. This approach, however, suffers from the
combinatorial explosion that happens when the supercell size is large, when
there are more than two atom types, or when there are multiple displaced atoms.
This problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of
unique arrangements that survive the elimination process. Here, we extend an
existing algorithm\cite{enum1,enum2,enum3} to include the extra configurational
degree of freedom from the inclusion of displacement directions. The algorithm
uses group theory to eliminate large classes of configurations, avoiding the
combinatoric explosion. With this approach we can now enumerate previously
inaccessible systems, including atomic displacements.

small-cells. The SP charges a price per unit rate for each type of service.
Each SP is given a fixed amount of bandwidth and splits it between macro- and
small-cells. Motivated by bandwidth regulations, such as those for the 3.5Gz
band, we assume a minimum amount of bandwidth has to be set aside for
small-cells. We study the optimal pricing and bandwidth allocation strategies
in both monopoly and competitive scenarios. In the monopoly scenario the
strategy is unique. In the competitive scenario there exists a unique Nash
equilibrium, which depends on the regulatory constraints. We also analyze the
social welfare achieved, and compare it to that without the small-cell
bandwidth constraints. Finally, we discuss implications of our results on the
effectiveness of the minimum bandwidth constraint on influencing small-cell
deployments.

and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Evaporation fronts directly
influence the gas and ice abundances of volatile species in the disk and
therefore the coagulation physics and efficiency and the chemical composition
of the resulting planetesimals.
  Aims. In this work we investigate the influence of the existence of the CO
ice line on the particle growth and on the distribution of CO in the disk.
  Methods. We include the possibility of tracking the CO content and/or other
volatiles in particles and in the gas in our existing dust coagulation and disk
evolution model and developed a method for evaporation and condensation of CO
using the Hertz-Knudsen equation. Our model does not include fragmentation,
yet, which will be part of further investigations.
  Results. We find no enhanced grain growth just outside the ice line where the
particle size is limited by radial drift. Instead we find a depletion of solid
material inside the ice line which is solely due to evaporation of the CO. Such
a depression inside the ice line may be observable and may help to quantify the
processes described in this work. Furthermore, we find that the viscosity and
diffusivity of the gas heavily influence the re-distribution of vaporized CO at
the ice line and can lead to an increase in the CO abundance by up to a factors
of a few in the region just inside the ice line. Depending on the strength of
the gaseous transport mechanisms the position of the ice line in our model can
change by up to 10 AU and consequently, the temperature at that location can
range from 21 K to 23 K.

arising as partial orders of configurations, are a landmark of concurrency
theory, providing a clear characterisation of causality in computations. They
have been used for defining a concurrent semantics of several formalisms, from
Petri nets to (linear) graph rewriting systems, which in turn lay at the basis
of many visual modelling frameworks. Stability however is restrictive when
dealing with formalisms with ""fusion"", i.e., where a computational step can not
only consume and produce but also merge parts of the state. This happens, e.g.,
for graph rewriting systems with non-linear rules, which are needed to cover
some relevant applications (such as the graphical encoding of calculi with name
passing). Guided by the need of capturing the semantics of formalisms with
fusion we leave aside stability and we characterise, as a natural
generalisation of prime algebraic domains, a class of domains, referred to as
weak prime domains. We then identify a corresponding class of event structures,
that we call connected event structures, via a duality result formalised as an
equivalence of categories. We show that connected event structures are exactly
the class of event structures that arise as the semantics of non-linear graph
rewriting systems. Interestingly, the category of general unstable event
structures coreflects into our category of weak prime domains, so that our
result provides a characterisation of the partial orders of configurations of

Quasi-infinitely divisible distributions appear naturally in the factorization
of infinitely divisible distributions. Namely, a distribution $\mu$ is
quasi-infinitely divisible if and only if there are two infinitely divisible
distributions $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ such that $\mu_1 \ast \mu = \mu_2$. The

than applications of the usual vanishing theorems and L2 estimates for the
d-bar equation, are required for its proof. This note (which is part of a
lecture given in the 60th birthday conference for Lawrence Ein) gives a
simpler, more straightforward proof of Skoda's result, which makes it a natural
consequence of the standard techniques in vanishing theorems and solving d-bar
equation with L2 estimates. The proof involves the following three ingredients:
(i) one particular Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for tensors with a special factor
which accounts for the exponent of the denominator in the formulation of the
integral condition for Skoda's ideal generation, (ii) the nonnegativity of
Nakano curvature of the induced metric of a special co-rank-1 subbundle of a
trivial vector bundle twisted by a special scalar weight function, and (iii)
the vanishing theorem and solvability of d-bar equation with L2 estimates for

However, many online applications are not contented with the simple data access
interface currently provided by highly-available datastores. Distributed
transaction support is demanded by applications such as large-scale online
payment used by Alipay or Paypal. Current solutions to distributed transaction
can spend more than half of the whole transaction processing time in
distributed commit. An efficient atomic commit protocol is highly desirable.
This paper presents the HACommit protocol, a logless one-phase commit protocol
for highly-available systems. HACommit has transaction participants vote for a
commit before the client decides to commit or abort the transaction; in
comparison, the state-of-the-art practice for distributed commit is to have the
client decide before participants vote. The change enables the removal of both
the participant logging and the coordinator logging steps in the distributed
commit process; it also makes possible that, after the client initiates the
transaction commit, the transaction data is visible to other transactions
within one communication roundtrip time (i.e., one phase). In the evaluation
with extensive experiments, HACommit outperforms recent atomic commit solutions
for highly-available datastores under different workloads. In the best case,
HACommit can commit in one fifth of the time 2PC does.

from its variational aspects: (i) the proposed particle filter is a controlled
interacting particle system where the control input represents the solution of
a mean-field type optimal control problem; and (ii) the associated density
transport is shown to be a gradient flow (steepest descent) for the optimal
value function, with respect to the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The optimal
control construction of the particle filter is a significant departure from the
classical importance sampling-resampling based approaches. There are several
practical advantages: (i) resampling, reproduction, death or birth of particles
is avoided; (ii) simulation variance can potentially be reduced by applying
feedback control principles; and (iii) the parametric approximation naturally
arises as a special case. The latter also suggests systematic approaches for
numerical approximation of the optimal control law. The theoretical results are

discrete actions) to mainstream convex optimization. Myopic actions are
important in control because decisions need to be made in an online manner and
without knowledge of future events, and discrete actions because many systems
have a finite (so non-convex) number of control decisions. For example, whether
to transmit a packet or not in communication networks. Our results show that
these two features can be encompassed in the subgradient method for the
Lagrange dual problem by the use of stochastic and $\epsilon$-subgradients. One
of the appealing features of our approach is that it decouples the choice of a
control action from a specific choice of subgradient, which allows us to design
control policies without changing the underlying convex updates. Two classes of
discrete control policies are presented: one that can make discrete actions by
looking only at the system's current state, and another that selects actions
using blocks. The latter class is useful for handling systems that have
constraints on the order in which actions are selected.

analyze the convergence behavior of the BP decoder using MET-DE. In joint
decoding of Raptor codes, the component codes correspond to inner code and
precode are decoded in parallel and provide information to each other. We also
derive an exact expression for the stability of Raptor codes with joint

contribution of this paper is to derive the feedback particle filter (FPF)

coordinate-free description of the filter that automatically satisfies the
geometric constraints of the manifold. The particle dynamics are encapsulated
in a Stratonovich stochastic differential equation that retains the feedback
structure of the original (Euclidean) FPF. The implementation of the filter
requires a solution of a Poisson equation on the Lie group, and two numerical
algorithms are described for this purpose. As an example, the FPF is applied to
the problem of attitude estimation - a nonlinear filtering problem on the Lie
group SO(3). The formulae of the filter are described using both the rotation
matrix and the quaternion coordinates. Comparisons are also provided between
the FPF and some popular algorithms for attitude estimation, namely the
multiplicative EKF, the unscented quaternion estimator, the left invariant EKF,

bulk crystal has high axial \k{appa} (237 W/m-K) at room temperature. The much
lower measured \k{appa} is attributed to the small size of nanocrystallites
(~10 nm) in synthesized semi-crystalline PE. For the 1-D chain, the predicted
\k{appa} is much larger and yet finite (1400 W/m-K at room temperature). The
reduction of scattering phase space caused by the diminished interchain van der
Waals interactions explains this larger \k{appa}. It is also found that the
transverse phonon branches with quadratic dispersion make minor contribution to
this, due to their vanishing group velocity in the long-wavelength limit.
Moreover, the low-frequency bending and twisting phonon modes are strongly
coupled and dominate anharmonic phonon scatterings, leading to the finite
\k{appa}. The predicted high \k{appa} of bulk and chain PE crystals enable
polymer usage in thermal management and the above phonon scatterings provide

a recursive approach for any number of serially arranged locally resonant mass
in mass cells, a closed form expression for the transfer function is derived.
Analysis of the end-to-end transfer function helps identify the fundamental
mechanism for the band gap formation in a finite metamaterial. This mechanism
includes (a) repeated complex conjugate zeros located at the natural frequency
of the individual local resonators, (b) the presence of two poles which flank
the band gap, and (c) the absence of poles in the band-gap. Analysis of the
finite cell dynamics are compared to the Bloch-wave analysis of infinitely long
metamaterials to confirm the theoretical limits of the band gap estimated by
the transfer function modeling. The analysis also explains how the band gap
evolves as the number of cells in the metamaterial chain increases and
highlights how the response varies depending on the chosen sensing location
along the length of the metamaterial. The proposed transfer function approach
to compute and evaluate band gaps in locally resonant structures provides a
framework for the exploitation of control techniques to modify and tune band
gaps in finite metamaterial realizations.

The merger of a helium-core white dwarf with a main-sequence star can produce a
red giant branch star that has a low-mass hydrogen envelope when helium is
ignited and thus become a hot subdwarf. Because detailed calculations have not
been made, we compute post-merger models with a stellar evolution code. We find
the evolutionary paths available to merger remnants and find the pre-merger
conditions that lead to the formation of hot subdwarfs. We find that some such
mergers result in the formation of stars with intermediate helium-rich
surfaces. These stars later develop helium-poor surfaces owing to diffusion.
Combining our results with a model population and comparing to observed stars,
we find that some observed intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs can be
explained as the remnants of the mergers of helium-core white dwarfs with

time and power splitting ratios between harvesting energy and transmitting
data. We then optimize the time and power splitting ratios for a group of
frames, assuming non-causal knowledge of harvested power and fading channel
gains, by giving an approximate solution. When only the statistics of the
energy arrivals and channel gains are known, we derive a dynamic programming
based policy and, propose three sub-optimal policies, which are shown to
perform competitively. In summary, our study suggests that battery internal
resistance significantly impacts the design and performance of energy
harvesting communication systems and must be taken into account.

concerns about the security of networked embedded devices. In this work, we
focus on the adaptation of Honeypots for improving the security of IoTs.
Low-interaction honeypots are used so far in the context of IoT. Such honeypots
are limited and easily detectable, and thus, there is a need to find ways how
to develop high-interaction, reliable, IoT honeypots that will attract skilled
attackers. In this work, we propose the SIPHON architecture - a Scalable
high-Interaction Honeypot platform for IoT devices. Our architecture leverages
IoT devices that are physically at one location and are connected to the
Internet through so-called wormholes distributed around the world. The
resulting architecture allows exposing few physical devices over a large number
of geographically distributed IP addresses. We demonstrate the proposed
architecture in a large scale experiment with 39 wormhole instances in 16
cities in 9 countries. Based on this setup, six physical IP cameras, one NVR
and one IP printer are presented as 85 real IoT devices on the Internet,
attracting a daily traffic of 700MB for a period of two months. A preliminary
analysis of the collected traffic indicates that devices in some cities
attracted significantly more traffic than others (ranging from 600 000 incoming
TCP connections for the most popular destination to less than 50000 for the
least popular). We recorded over 400 brute-force login attempts to the
web-interface of our devices using a total of 1826 distinct credentials, from
which 11 attempts were successful. Moreover, we noted login attempts to Telnet
and SSH ports some of which used credentials found in the recently disclosed
Mirai malware.

compare these galaxies to a control sample of average galaxies detected in the
HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS, Barnes et al. 2001). As the control sample is
matched in stellar luminosity, we find that the stellar properties of HIX
galaxies are similar to the control sample. Furthermore, the specific star
formation rate and optical morphology do not differ between HIX and control
galaxies. We find, however, the HIX galaxies to be less efficient in forming
stars. For the most HI massive galaxy in our sample (ESO075-G006, $\rm log\

inefficient star formation and HI excess. Examining the Australian Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) HI imaging and Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) optical
spectra of ESO075-G006 reveals an undisturbed galaxy without evidence for
recent major, violent accretion events. A tilted-ring fit to the HI disc
together with the gas-phase oxygen abundance distribution supports the scenario
that gas has been constantly accreted onto ESO07-G006 but the high specific
angular momentum makes ESO075-G006 very inefficient in forming stars. Thus a
massive HI disc has been built up.

We report on the detection of a ~65 d period X-ray modulation with Swift
observations in this system. The modulation period found in the X-ray band is
P=65.05+/-0.10 d and the profile is asymmetric with a fast rise and a slower
decay. On the other hand, the u-band light curve collected by Swift UVOT
confirmed an optical modulation with a period of P=64.24+/-0.13 d. We explored
the phase evolution of the X-ray and optical periodicities and propose two
solutions. A superorbital modulation with a period of ~2,700-4,700 d probably
caused by the precession of a warped accretion disk is necessary to interpret
the phase drift of the optical data. We further discuss the implication if this
~65d periodicity is caused by the superorbital modulation. Estimated from the
relationship between the spin-orbital and orbital-superorbital periods of known
disk-fed high-mass X-ray binaries, the orbital period of P13 is roughly
estimated as 3-7 d. In this case, an unknown mechanism with a much longer time
scale is needed to interpret the phase drift. Further studies on the stability
of these two periodicities with a long-term monitoring could help us to probe
their physical origins.

measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry of hadrons produced in semi-inclusive
deep inelastic scattering of leptons off transversely polarised nucleon
targets, and it turned out to be non-zero for quarks. In this letter the
evaluation of the Sivers asymmetry for gluons in the same process is presented.
The analysis method is based on a Monte Carlo simulation that includes three
hard processes: photon-gluon fusion, QCD Compton scattering and leading-order
virtual-photon absorption process. The Sivers asymmetries of the three
processes are simultaneously extracted using the LEPTO event generator and a
neural network approach. The method is applied to samples of events containing
at least two hadrons with large transverse momentum from the COMPASS data taken
with a 160 GeV/$c$ muon beam scattered off transversely polarised deuterons and
protons. With a significance of more than two standard deviations a negative
value is obtained for the gluon Sivers asymmetry. The result of a similar
analysis for a Collins-like asymmetry for gluons is consistent with zero.

and the dynamics of discourse from a variety of perspectives ranging from
information theory and biology to sociology. Following Husserl's idea of a
horizon of meaning in intersubjective communication, we propose a way in which,
using Shannon's equations, the generation and selection of meanings from a
horizon of possibilities can be considered probabilistically. The
information-theoretical dynamics we articulate considers a process of meaning
generation within cultural evolution: information is imbued with meaning, and
through this process, the number of options for the selection of meaning in
discourse proliferates. The redundancy of possible meanings contributes to a
codification of expectations within the discourse. Unlike hard-wired DNA, the
codes of non-biological systems can co-evolve with the variations. Spanning
horizons of meaning, the codes structure the communications as selection
environments that shape discourses. Discursive knowledge can be considered as
meta-coded communication which enables us to translate among differently coded
communications. The dynamics of discursive knowledge production can thus infuse
the historical dynamics with a cultural evolution by adding options, that is,
by increasing redundancy. A calculus of redundancy is presented as an indicator
whereby these dynamics of discourse and meaning may be explored empirically.

code with availability is said to be 'rate-optimal', if its rate is maximum

  This paper focuses on rate-optimal binary, linear codes with small
availability, and makes four contributions. First, it establishes tight upper
bounds on the rate of binary linear codes with $(r,2)$ and $(2,3)$
availability. Second, it establishes a uniqueness result for binary

of cosets of the dual of a code with availability, using its covering
properties. Finally, it presents a class of locally repairable linear codes

also proven that $C\left(\Phi_{2}\right)=\hat{F}_{\omega}$ and
$C\left(\Phi_{3}\right)\supseteq\hat{F}_{\omega}$. In this paper we prove that
$C\left(\Phi_{n}\right)$ for $n\geq4$ is abelian. So, while the dichotomy in
the abelian case is between $n=2$ and $n\geq3$, in the metabelian case it is
between $n=2,3$ and $n\geq4$.

z = 3.1$ HI Lya absorption relative to the cosmic mean, Delta_NB497, estimated
from photometric data of star-forming galaxies at 3.3 < z < 3.5, we have made
two-dimensional Delta_NB497 maps in the z = 3.1 SSA22 proto-cluster region and
two control fields (SXDS and GOODS-N fields) with a spatial resolution of ~ 5
comoving Mpc. The Delta_NB497 measurements in the SSA22 field are
systematically larger than those in the control fields, and this HI absorption
enhancement extends more than 50 comoving Mpc. The field-averaged (i.e., ~50
comoving Mpc scale) Delta_NB497 and the overdensity of Lya emitters (LAEs) seem
to be correlated, while there is no clear dependency of the Delta_NB497 on the
local LAE overdensity in a few comoving Mpc scale. These results suggest that
diffuse HI gas spreads out in/around the SSA22 proto-cluster. We have also
found an enhancement of Delta_NB497 at a projected distance < 100 physical kpc
from the nearest z = 3.1 galaxies at least in the SSA22 field, which is
probably due to HI gas associated with the CGM of individual galaxies. The HI
absorption enhancement in the CGM-scale tends to be weaker around galaxies with
stronger Lya emission, which suggests that the Lya escape fraction from
galaxies depends on hydrogen neutrality in the CGM.

shown unexpected discrepancies for the mass distribution of stars between the

revisit the analysis of the asteroseismic sample of dwarf and subgiant stars
observed by Kepler and investigate in detail the possible causes for the
reported discrepancy. We investigate two models of the Milky Way based on
stellar population synthesis, Galaxia and TRILEGAL. In agreement with previous
results, we find that TRILEGAL predicts more massive stars compared to Galaxia,
and that TRILEGAL predicts too many blue stars compared to 2MASS observations.
Both models fail to match the distribution of the stellar sample in $(\log
g,T_{\rm eff})$ space, pointing to inaccuracies in the models and/or the
assumed selection function. When corrected for this mismatch in $(\log g,T_{\rm
eff})$ space, the mass distribution calculated by Galaxia is broader and the
mean is shifted toward lower masses compared to that of the observed stars.
This behaviour is similar to what has been reported for the Kepler red giant
sample. The shift between the mass distributions is equivalent to a change of
2\% in $\nu_{\rm max}$, which is within the current uncertainty in the
$\nu_{\rm max}$ scaling relation. Applying corrections to the $\Delta \nu$
scaling relation predicted by the stellar models makes the observed mass
distribution significantly narrower, but there is no change to the mean.

the view point of dynamics, which is described by the Vlasov equation in the
limit of large population. Due to existence of the Casimir invariants of the
Vlasov dynamics, an external field does not drive the system to the forced
thermal equilibrium in general, and the linear response is suppressed. With the
aid of a linear response theory based on the Vlasov dynamics, we compute the
suppressed linear response in a system having two order parameters, which
introduce the conjugate two external fields and the susceptibility matrix of
size two accordingly. Moreover, the two order parameters bring three phases and
the three types of second-order phase transitions between two of them. For each
type of the phase transitions, all the critical exponents for elements of the
susceptibility matrix are computed. The critical exponents reveal that some
elements of the matrices do not diverge even at critical points, while the
mean-field theory predicts divergences. The linear response theory also
suggests appearance of negative off-diagonal elements, in other words, an
applied external field decreases the value of an order parameter. These
theoretical predictions are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the
Vlasov equation.

body model fits for multiple human pose datasets. Human annotators solely sort
good and bad fits. This procedure leads to an initial dataset, UP-3D, with rich
annotations. With a comprehensive set of experiments, we show how this data can
be used to train discriminative models that produce results with an
unprecedented level of detail: our models predict 31 segments and 91 landmark
locations on the body. Using the 91 landmark pose estimator, we present
state-of-the art results for 3D human pose and shape estimation using an order
of magnitude less training data and without assumptions about gender or pose in
the fitting procedure. We show that UP-3D can be enhanced with these improved
fits to grow in quantity and quality, which makes the system deployable on
large scale. The data, code and models are available for research purposes.

Unfortunately, such materials are often sensitive to disorder and suffer from
phase fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter which diverge with
temperature $T$, magnetic field $H$ or current $I$. We propose an approach to
overcome synthesis and fluctuation problems: building superconductors from
inhomogeneous composites of nanofilaments. Macroscopic crystals of
quasi-one-dimensional Na$_{2-\delta}$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ featuring Na vacancy disorder
($\delta\approx$~0.2) are shown to behave as percolative networks of
superconducting nanowires. Long range order is established via transverse
coupling between individual one-dimensional filaments, yet phase coherence
remains unstable to fluctuations and localization in the zero-($T$,$H$,$I$)
limit. However, a region of reentrant phase coherence develops upon raising
($T$,$H$,$I$). We attribute this phenomenon to an enhancement of the transverse
coupling due to electron delocalization. Our observations of reentrant phase
coherence coincide with a peak in the Josephson energy $E_J$ at non-zero
($T$,$H$,$I$), which we estimate using a simple analytical model for a
disordered anisotropic superconductor. Na$_{2-\delta}$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ is therefore
a blueprint for a future generation of nanofilamentary superconductors with
inbuilt resilience to phase fluctuations at elevated ($T$,$H$,$I$).

categories of existing approaches: classical image-to-image change detection
and time series analysis. Recent findings: With the launch of the Sentinel-2a
satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the
most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping
approaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. The
methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A
separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies
for two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus on
Europe and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa. Summary: The
review revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forest
degradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transfer
these approaches to high resolution time series data from multiple sensors.
Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance types
and the development of robust up-scalable methods to enable near real time
disturbance mapping in support of operational reactive measures.

the joint inclusion probabilities of units and especially the spreading of

sampling design, these differences follow a geometric distribution, and with a
simple random sampling design they follow a negative hypergeometric

of sampling designs with and without fixed sample size. The choice of the
rank-difference distribution allows us to control units joint inclusion
probabilities with a relatively simple method and closed form formula. Joint
inclusion probabilities of neighboring units can be chosen to be larger, or
smaller, compared to those of Bernoulli or simple random sampling, thus
allowing to more or less spread the sample on the population. This can be
useful when neighboring units have similar characteristics or, on the contrary,
are very different. A set of simulations illustrates the qualities of this

diffuse to the surrounding medium and interact with gas, magnetic field and

too low. Despite protons can produce a non-zero contribution in gamma-ray
emission, it is unlikely that they and their secondary electrons can make a
significant contribution in hard X-ray flux. In the case of pure leptonic

--- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just
being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally,
it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid
an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as
a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression
independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the
bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span
before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by
the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the
rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has
completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy
sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across
all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future
rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a
reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the
auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is
the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition,
we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding
policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding
environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world
auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation
using neural networks.

the relevant equations in terms of Laplace transform with respect to the
comoving time $t$ instead of the usual Fourier one that is no longer available
in a cosmological context. Both axial and polar perturbation equations are
expressed in terms of a non trivial mixture of retarded-advanced metric
coefficients with respect to the Laplace parameter $s$ (complex translation).
The axial case is studied in more detail. In particular, the axial
perturbations can be reduced to a master linear second-order differential
equation in terms of the Regge-Wheeler function $Z$ where a coupling with a
retarded $Z$ with respect to the cosmological time $t$ is present. It is shown
that a de Sitter expanding universe can change the frequency $\omega$ of a

much more involved. Nevertheless, we show that also the polar perturbations can

of an unfolding technique, which allows us to trace back the electronic states
into the primitive cell of the pure compounds, we are able to disentangle the
effects brought by the local structural deformations and by the impurity
potential to the states at the Fermi level. Our results are compared with

understanding of the role of Ru in iron pnictides: although isovalent to Fe,
the Ru-Fe substitution leads to changes in the band structure at the Fermi

well-defined notions of cohesion and separation. These might be graphs and
matroids, but can be much more general or quite different. The theorem asserts
a duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere local and a
global overall tree structure.
  We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in the format of tangles:
as orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency axioms.
These axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure,
such as a graph or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations
themselves. This makes it possible to identify tangles, and apply our
tangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings.
  Our result implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in
graph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width or rank-width.
It yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width and path-width. It
implies the existence of width parameters dual to cohesive substructures such
as $k$-blocks, edge-tangles, or given subsets of tangles, for which no width
duality theorems were previously known.
  Abstract separation systems can be found also in structures quite unlike
graphs and matroids. For example, our theorem can be applied to image analysis
by capturing the regions of an image as tangles of separations defined as
natural partitions of its set of pixels. It can be applied in big data contexts
by capturing clusters as tangles. It can be applied in the social sciences,
e.g. by capturing as tangles the few typical mindsets of individuals found by a
survey. It could also be applied in pure mathematics, e.g. to separations of
compact manifolds.

applied voltages, which separate a regime of periodic current oscillations from
a region of no current oscillations at all. In the voltage region without

accumulation layer from a high-field regime closer to the collector contact.
With increasing noise amplitude, spontaneous chaotic current oscillations
appear over a wider bias voltage range. For these bias voltages, the domain
boundary between the two electric-field domains becomes unstable, and very
small current or voltage fluctuations can trigger the domain boundary to move
toward the collector and induce chaotic current spikes. The experimentally

Increased noise can consequently enhance chaotic current oscillations in

to improve learning efficiency in another domain - the target domain. Existing
heterogeneous domain adaptation research is relatively well-progressed, but
only in situations where the target domain contains at least a few labeled
instances. In contrast, heterogeneous domain adaptation with an unlabeled
target domain has not been well-studied. To contribute to the research in this
emerging field, this paper presents: (1) an unsupervised knowledge transfer
theorem that guarantees the correctness of transferring knowledge; and (2) a
principal angle-based metric to measure the distance between two pairs of
domains: one pair comprises the original source and target domains and the
other pair comprises two homogeneous representations of two domains. The
theorem and the metric have been implemented in an innovative transfer model,
called a Grassmann-Linear monotonic maps-geodesic flow kernel (GLG), that is
specifically designed for heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (HeUDA).
The linear monotonic maps meet the conditions of the theorem and are used to
construct homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains. The metric
shows the extent to which the homogeneous representations have preserved the
information in the original source and target domains. By minimizing the
proposed metric, the GLG model learns the homogeneous representations of
heterogeneous domains and transfers knowledge through these learned
representations via a geodesic flow kernel. To evaluate the model, five public
datasets were reorganized into ten HeUDA tasks across three applications:
cancer detection, credit assessment, and text classification. The experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model delivers superior performance over the
existing baselines.

challenging, especially at high loop orders. Here we show that we can instead
start from generic gauge-theory integrands, where the duality is not manifest,

include contact terms generated by violations of dual Jacobi identities. We
illustrate this with three-, four- and five-loop examples in N=8 supergravity.

Each CCN router has a cache to store the chunks passed by it. Therefore the
caching strategy about chunk placement can greatly affect the whole CCN
performance. This paper proposes an implicit coordinate chunk caching location
and searching scheme (CLS) in CCN hierarchical infrastructure. In CLS, there is
at most one copy of a chunk cached on the path between a server and a leaf
router. This copy is pulled down one level towards the leaf router by a request
or pushed up one level towards the server by the cache eviction. Thus, it is
possible to store more diverse contents in the whole CCN and improve the
network performance. Plus, in order to reduce the server workload and file
download time, a caching trail of chunk is created to direct the following
request where to find the chunk. Extensive test-bed experiments have been
performed to evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of a wide range of
performance metrics. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms
existing algorithms.

improved by (1) time-lapse difference inversion; (2) incorporation of
statistical information about the expected model update (i.e., the model
regularization is based on a geostatistical model); (3) using alternative model
norms to quantify temporal changes (i.e., approximations of l1 and Cauchy norms
using iteratively reweighted least-squares), (4) constraining model updates to
predefined ranges (i.e., using Lagrange Multipliers to only allow either
increases or decreases of electrical resistivity with respect to background
conditions). To do so, we consider a simple illustrative model and a more
realistic test case related to seawater intrusion. The results are encouraging
and show significant improvements when using time-lapse difference inversion
with non l2 model norms. Artifacts that may arise when imposing compactness of
regions with temporal changes can be suppressed through inequality constraints
to yield models without oscillations outside the true region of temporal
changes. Based on these results, we recommend approximate l1-norm solutions as
they can resolve both sharp and smooth interfaces within the same model.

have different properties. The BDs which are related to PMJs always appear at
the top of the PMJs, the vast majority of which show inward motion and
originate before the generation of the PMJs. These results may indicate that
the reconnection occurs at the lower coronal/TR height and initiates PMJs at
the chromosphere. This formation mechanism is in contrast with the currently
believed formation of PMJs by reconnection in the (upper) photosphere between

Among the known ETNOs, the pair (474640) 2004 VN112-2013 RF98 stands out. Their
orbital poles and the directions of their perihelia and their velocities at
perihelion/aphelion are separated by a few degrees, but orbital similarity does
not necessarily imply common physical origin. In an attempt to unravel their
physical nature, visible spectroscopy of both targets was obtained using the
OSIRIS camera-spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). From
the spectral analysis, we find that 474640-2013 RF98 have similar spectral
slopes (12 vs. 15 %/0.1um), very different from Sedna's but compatible with
those of (148209) 2000 CR105 and 2012 VP113. These five ETNOs belong to the
group of seven linked to the Planet Nine hypothesis. A dynamical pathway
consistent with these findings is dissociation of a binary asteroid during a
close encounter with a planet and we confirm its plausibility using N-body
simulations. We thus conclude that both the dynamical and spectroscopic

suggest that the pair was kicked by a perturber near aphelion.

large shearing box approximation, as well as a set of global disc models, we
study the optimal growth of the shearing vortices in such a flow in the whole
range of azimuthal length-scales, $\lambda_y$, as compared to the flow
scale-height, $H$. It is shown that with the account of the viscosity the
highest possible amplification of shearing vortices, $G_{max}$, attains maximum
at $\lambda_y\lesssim H$ and declines towards both the large scales
$\lambda_y\gg H$ and the small scales $\lambda_y\ll H$ in a good agreement with
analytical estimations based on balanced solutions. We pay main attention to
the large-scale vortices $\lambda_y\gg H$, which produce $G_{max}\propto
(\Omega/\kappa)^4$, where $\Omega$ and $\kappa$ denote local rotational and
epicyclic frequencies, respectively. It is demonstrated that the large-scale
vortices acquire high density perturbation as they approach the instant of
swing. At the same time, their growth is not affected by bulk viscosity. We
check that $G_{max}$ obtained globally is comparable to its local counterpart
and the shape and localisation of global optimal vortices can be explained in
terms of the local approach. The obtained results allow us to suggest that the
critical Reynolds number of subcritical transition to turbulence in
quasi-Keplerian flow, as well as the corresponding turbulent effective
azimuthal stress should substantially depend on shear rate.

Significant NH3 emission has been observed in both the +50 km/s Cloud and the

NxK, with N>=K, Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the unit disk. The
mathematical techniques we develop to prove our main results are inspired by a
link---first established by by Selberg [1] and later extended by Moitra
[2]---between the extremal singular values of Vandermonde matrices with nodes
on the unit circle and large sieve inequalities. Our main conceptual
contribution lies in establishing a connection between the extremal singular
values of Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the unit disk and a novel large
sieve inequality involving polynomials in z \in C with |z|<=1. Compared to
Baz\'an's upper bound on the condition number [3], which, to the best of our
knowledge, constitutes the only analytical result---available in the
literature---on the condition number of Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the
unit disk, our bound not only takes a much simpler form, but is also sharper
for certain node configurations. Moreover, the bound we obtain can be evaluated
consistently in a numerically stable fashion, whereas the evaluation of
Baz\'an's bound requires the solution of a linear system of equations which has
the same condition number as the Vandermonde matrix under consideration and can
therefore lead to numerical instability in practice. As a byproduct, our
result---when particularized to the case of nodes on the unit circle---slightly
improves upon the Selberg-Moitra bound.

from a positive bias that should be suppressed. To develop a correction method
that, when applied to maps, should provide a distribution of polarised
intensity that closely follows the signal from the source. We propose a new
method to suppress the bias by estimating the polarisation angle of the source
signal in a noisy environment with help of a modified median filter. We then
determine the polarised intensity, including the noise, by projection of the
observed values of Stokes U and Q onto the direction of this polarisation
angle. We show that our new method represents the true signal very well. If the
noise distribution in the maps of U and Q is Gaussian, then in the corrected
map of polarised intensity it is also Gaussian. Smoothing to larger Gaussian
beamsizes, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, can be done directly with our
method in the map of the polarised intensity. Our method also works in case of
non-Gaussian noise distributions. The maps of the corrected polarised
intensities and polarisation angles are reliable even in regions with weak
signals and provide integrated flux densities and degrees of polarisation
without the cumulative effect of the bias, which especially affects faint
sources. Features at low intensity levels like 'depolarisation canals' are
smoother than in the maps using the previous methods, which has broader
implications, for example on the interpretation of interstellar turbulence.

inversion of plane-wave electromagnetic (EM) data. Using synthetic data, we
investigate how model parameter uncertainty depends on model structure
constraints using different norms of the likelihood function and the model
constraints, and study the added benefits of joint inversion of EM and
electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. Our results demonstrate that
model structure constraints are a necessity to stabilize the MCMC inversion
results of a highly-discretized model. These constraints decrease model
parameter uncertainty and facilitate model interpretation. A drawback is that
these constraints may lead to posterior distributions that do not fully include
the true underlying model, because some of its features exhibit a low
sensitivity to the EM data, and hence are difficult to resolve. This problem
can be partly mitigated if the plane-wave EM data is augmented with ERT
observations. The hierarchical Bayesian inverse formulation introduced and used
herein is able to successfully recover the probabilistic properties of the
measurement data errors and a model regularization weight. Application of the
proposed inversion methodology to field data from an aquifer demonstrates that
the posterior mean model realization is very similar to that derived from a
deterministic inversion with similar model constraints.

natural cooperative foraging behavior such as that performed by ants around

agents' goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both k and D,
where D is the (unknown) distance between the central location and the target.
We concentrate on the case in which agents cannot communicate while searching.
It is straightforward to see that the time until at least one agent finds the
target is at least $\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), even for very sophisticated agents,
with unrestricted memory. Our algorithmic analysis aims at establishing
connections between the time complexity and the initial knowledge held by
agents (e.g., regarding their total number k), as they commence the search. We
provide a range of both upper and lower bounds for the initial knowledge
required for obtaining fast running time. For example, we prove that log log k
+ $\Theta$(1) bits of initial information are both necessary and sufficient to
obtain asymptotically optimal running time, i.e., O(D +D 2 /k). We also we

$\Omega$(log k) different states as they leave the nest to start the search. To
the best of our knowledge, the lower bounds presented in this paper provide the
first non-trivial lower bounds on the memory complexity of probabilistic agents
in the context of search problems. We view this paper as a ""proof of concept""

the asymptotic symmetries of a body whose exterior is a boosted Schwarzschild

Schwarzschild body which is initially at rest, then goes through a radiative
stage and finally emerges as a boosted Schwarzschild body. We show that the
proper retarded solution of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime for this
process can be described in terms of the ingoing Kerr-Schild form of the
Schwarzschild metric for both the initial and final states. An outgoing
Kerr-Schild or time symmetric metric does not give the proper solution. The
special property of Kerr-Schild metrics that their linearized and nonlinear
forms are identical allows us to extend this result to processes in the
nonlinear regime. We then discuss how the nonlinear memory effect, and its
associated supertranslation, affect angular momentum conservation. Our approach
provides a new framework for studying nonlinear aspects of the memory effect.

a critical coupling ratio $G_D/G_S\sim 1.1$ below which chiral or

ratio, there exists a significant mixed broken phase region where both gaps are
non-zero. However, a strong magnetic field $B\gtrsim 10^{18}$ G disrupts this

the power factor and enhance the ZT figure of merit of thermoelectric
materials. In this work we explore the effect that reduced dimensionality has
on the success of the energy-filtering mechanism for power factor enhancement.
We use the quantum mechanical non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method
for electron transport including electron-phonon scattering to explore 1D and
2D superlattice/nanocomposite systems. We find that, given identical material
parameters, 1D channels utilize energy filtering more effectively than 2D as
they: i) allow one to achieve maximal power factor for smaller well sizes /
smaller grains (which is needed to maximize phonon scattering), ii) take better
advantage of a lower thermal conductivity in the barrier/boundary materials
compared to the well/grain materials in both: enhancing the Seebeck
coefficient; and in producing a system which is robust against detrimental
random deviations from optimal barrier design. In certain cases we find that
the relative advantage can be as high as a factor of 3. We determine that
energy-filtering is most effective when the average energy of carrier flow
varies the most in the wells and the barriers along the channel, an event which
appears when the energy of the carrier flow in the host material is low and
when the energy relaxation mean-free-path of carriers is short. Although the
ultimate reason these aspects, which cause a 1D system to see greater relative
improvement than a 2D, is the 1D system's van Hove singularity in the
density-of-states, the insights obtained are general and inform
energy-filtering design beyond dimensional considerations.

derived by integrating the 3D Free Surface Euler equations but without imposing
any restriction on the channel width variations. %leading to a new coupling
term. Finite volume methods are formulated for both the 2D and 1D models
including a discrete coupling term in closed form. Coupling is achieved through
the discrete coupling term in the 1D model and the lateral numerical fluxes in
the 2D model. Since the lateral discharge in the channel cannot be guaranteed
to be zero during flooding, we aim to recover the lateral variation by
computing two lateral discharges over each cross section and propose to use an
ad-hoc model based on the $y$-discharge equation in the 2D model for this
purpose. We then propose the numerical scheme for this ad-hoc model following
the hydrostatic reconstruction philosophy. Then, we show that the resulting
method, named Horizontal Coupling Method (HCM), is well-balanced; we introduce
the no-numerical flooding property and also show that the method satisfies the
property. Three numerical test cases are used to verify the performance of the
method. The results show that the method performs well in both accuracy and

We extend the algorithmic framework and the theoretical analysis of approximate
message passing (AMP), an iterative algorithm for solving linear inverse
problems, whose asymptotic dynamics are characterized by state evolution (SE).
In particular, we show that column-wise multiprocessor AMP (C-MP-AMP) obeys an
SE under the same assumptions when the SE for AMP holds. The SE results imply
that (i) the SE of C-MP-AMP converges to a state that is no worse than that of
AMP and (ii) the asymptotic dynamics of C-MP-AMP and AMP can be identical.
Moreover, for a setting that is not covered by SE, numerical results show that
damping can improve the convergence performance of C-MP-AMP.

physically realizable local strategies can be far from optimal for extracting

into a K\""ahler measure for Delaunay triangulations, or equivalently on the

the topological Weil-Petersson symplectic form on the moduli space $\mathcal

all triangulations on the plane, has maximality properties for Delaunay

that the volume $\mathcal{V}_N$ on triangulations with $N+3$ points is
monotonically increasing when a point is added, $N\to N+1$. We expect that this

re-addressed, where $I$ denotes one of the intervals: $(-\infty, \infty)$,
$(-\infty, a]$, $[b, \infty)$, $[a, b]$, where $a < b$ are real numbers. Such
maps must have a fixed point, say $z$, in the interior of $I$. Some well-known
properties of such maps are re-proved in a systematic way according to the
following :
  (1) $f$ moves some point $c \ne z$ away from $z$, i.e., fo some point $c \ne
z$, we have $f(c) \le c < z$ or $z < c \le f(c)$;
  (2) $f$ moves some point $\hat c \ne z$ towards but not ""over"" $z$, i.e., for
some point $\hat c \ne z$, we have $\hat c < f(\hat c) < z$ or $z < f(\hat c) <
\hat c$; and
  (3) $f$ moves all points $x \ne z$ to the other side of $z$, i.e., for all
points $x \ne z$, we have $x < z \le f(x)$ and $f(x) \le x < z$.
  The proofs are arranged in such ways that they yield the same results. For
example, Theorem 3 treats maps satisfying Condition (1) or Condition (2) while
Theorem 4 treats separately maps satisfying Condition (1) and, Conditions (2)
or (3). Characterizations of continuous bitransitive maps on an interval are
re-addressed and a new chaotic property of continuous bitransitive maps is also
introduced (Theorem 8, p.21).
  In this revision, we correct Corollary 9 and some errors in the proof of
Theorem 8 and move the Appendix to a different paper [15] in which we
generalize Theorem 8 for continuous weakly mixing (i.e., bitransitive) maps on
intervals to continuous weakly mixing maps and continuous mixing maps on
infinite separable locally compact metric spaces.

general, from small spatial coverage of the cluster area. WINGS, the most
homogeneous and complete study of galaxies in dense environments to date,
obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 48 clusters at a median redshift of 0.05,
out to an average distance of approximately 0.5 cluster virial radii. The WINGS
photometric survey was recently extended by the VST survey OmegaWINGS to cover
the outskirts of a subset of the original cluster sample. In this work, we
present the spectroscopic follow-up of 33 of the 46 clusters of galaxies
observed with VST over 1 square degree. The aim of this spectroscopic survey is
to enlarge the number of cluster members and study the galaxy characteristics
and the cluster dynamical properties out to large radii, reaching the virial
radius and beyond. We used the AAOmega spectrograph at AAT to obtain
fiber-integrated spectra covering the wavelength region between 3800 and 9000
A, with a spectral resolution of 3.5-6 A full width at half maximum (FWHM).
Observations were performed using two different configurations and exposure
times per cluster. We measured redshifts using both absorption and emission
lines and used them to derive the cluster redshifts and velocity dispersions.
We present here the redshift measurements for 17985 galaxies, 7497 of which
turned out to be cluster members. The sample magnitude completeness is 80% at
V=20. Thanks to the observing strategy, the radial completeness turned out to
be relatively constant (90%) within the AAOmega field of view. The success rate
in measuring redshifts is 95%, at all radii. We provide redshifts for the full
sample of galaxies in OmegaWINGS clusters together with updated and robust
cluster redshift and velocity dispersions. These data will be publicly
accessible through the CDS and VO archives.

massive stars, that sets the physical backdrop to these violent events, is
theoretically not well understood and difficult to probe observationally. Here
we report the discovery of the supernova iPTF13dqy = SN 2013fs, a mere ~3 hr
after explosion. Our rapid follow-up observations, which include
multiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at ~6 hr
post-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate
environment (<~ 10^15 cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was
surrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final ~1
yr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10^-3 solar masses per year. The
complete disappearance of flash-ionised emission lines within the first several
days requires that the dense CSM be confined to within <~ 10^15 cm, consistent
with radio non-detections at 70--100 days. The observations indicate that
iPTF13dqy was a regular Type II SN; thus, the finding that the probable red
supergiant (RSG) progenitor of this common explosion ejected material at a
highly elevated rate just prior to its demise suggests that pre-supernova
instabilities may be common among exploding massive stars.

dipolar excitons in GaAs bilayer heterostructure into a new, dense and dark

findings and the emerging evident properties of this collective liquid-like
phase. We show that the phase transition is characterized by a sharp increase
of the number of non-emitting dipoles, by a clear contraction of the fluid
spatial extent into the bottom of the parabolic-like trap, and by spectral
narrowing. We extract the total density of the condensed phase which we find to
be consistent with the expected density regime of a quantum liquid. We show
that there are clear critical temperature and excitation power onsets for the
phase transition and that as the power further increases above the critical
power, the strong darkening is reduced down until no clear darkening is
observed. At this point another transition appears which we interpret as a
transition to a strongly repulsive yet correlated $e$-$h$ plasma. Based on the
experimental findings, we suggest that the physical mechanism that may be
responsible for the transition is a dynamical final-state stimulation of the
dipolar excitons to their dark spin states, which have a long lifetime and thus
support the observed sharp increase in density. Further experiments and
modeling will hopefully be able to unambiguously identify the physical
mechanism behind these recent observations.

point, systems display long range order and their macroscopic behaviors are
independent of the microscopic details making up the system. Due to these
properties, it has long been speculated that biological systems that show
similar behavior despite having very different microscopics, may be operating
near a critical point. Recent methods in neuroscience are making it possible to
explore whether criticality exists in neural networks. Despite being large in
size, many data sets are still only a minute sample of the neural system and
methods towards expanding these data sets have to be considered in order to
study the existence of criticality. In this work we develop an analytical
method of expanding a dataset to the large N limit so that statements about the
critical nature of the data set could be made. We also show using a particular
dataset analyzed computationally in literature that expanding data sets keeping
the moments of the original data set need not lead to unique values of the
critical temperature when the large N limit is considered analytically, despite
the mirage of them appearing to do so when analyzed computationally. This
suggests that not all available data sets from experiments are amenable for
understanding the critically of the underlying system.

nucleon-nucleon interaction is obtained using the HAL QCD method and its
short-distance repulsion is treated by means of ladder resummations outside the

from infrared extrapolations even for the relatively hard potentials of HAL

binding energies are sensibly improved by the full account of many-body
correlations. The results suggest an interesting possible behaviour in which
nuclei are unbound at very large pion masses and islands of stability appear at
first around the traditional doubly-magic numbers when the pion mass is lowered
toward its physical value. The calculated one-nucleon spectral distributions
are qualitatively close to those of real nuclei even for the pseudo-scalar

related alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can
be made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the
subject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual
measurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely
used, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,
is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of
dispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction
method, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive
modeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically
aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite
sample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type
algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic
manner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed
as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are
estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental
evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy
compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the
ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between
subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score

the presence of warps in protoplanetary discs, however a general comprehensive
description of observational diagnostics of warped discs was missing. We
performed a series of 3D SPH hydrodynamic simulations and combined them with 3D
radiative transfer calculations to study the observability of warps in
circumbinary discs, whose plane is misaligned with respect to the orbital plane
of the central binary. Our numerical hydrodynamic simulations confirm previous
analytical results on the dependence of the warp structure on the viscosity and
the initial misalignment between the binary and the disc. To study the
observational signatures of warps we calculate images in the continuum at
near-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths and in the pure rotational
transition of CO in the sub-millimetre. Warped circumbinary discs show surface
brightness asymmetry in near-infrared scattered light images as well as in
optically thick gas lines at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The asymmetry is
caused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the
strength of the asymmetry depends on the strength of the warp. The projected
velocity field, derived from line observations, shows characteristic
deviations, twists and a change in the slope of the rotation curve, from that
of an unperturbed disc. In extreme cases even the direction of rotation appears
to change in the disc inwards of a characteristic radius. The strength of the
kinematical signatures of warps decreases with increasing inclination. The
strength of all warp signatures decreases with decreasing viscosity.

combined with coupled-physics finite-element-method based simulations to
elucidate the behavior of polarization in isolated spherical PbTiO3 or BaTiO3
nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric medium, including air. The equilibrium
polarization topology is strongly affected by particle diameter, as well as the
choice of inclusion and matrix materials, with monodomain, vortex-like and
multidomain patterns emerging for various combinations of size and materials
parameters. This leads to radically different polarization vs electric field
responses, resulting in highly tunable size-dependent dielectric properties
that should be possible to observe experimentally. Our calculations show that
there is a critical particle size below which ferroelectricity vanishes. For
the PbTiO3 particle, this size is 2 and 3.4 nm, respectively, for high- and
low-permittivity media. For the BaTiO3 particle, it is ~3.6 nm regardless of

follows: let $f_n$ be a sequence of positive integers; an initial fire starts
at a finite set of vertices; at each (integer) time $n\geq 1$, $f_n$ vertices
which are not on fire become protected, and then the fire spreads to all
unprotected neighbors of vertices on fire; once a vertex is protected or is on

president elected democratically via universal suffrage (deterministic outcome,
the actual majority decides), and a president elected by one person randomly
selected from the population (probabilistic outcome depending on respective
supports). Moving from one voting agent to a group of r randomly selected
voting agents reduces the probabilistic character of the outcome. Building r
such groups, each one electing its president, to constitute a group of the
groups with the r local presidents electing a higher-level president, does
reduce further the outcome probabilistic aspect. Repeating the process n times
leads to a n-level bottom-up pyramidal structure. The hierarchy top president
is still elected with a probability but the distance from a deterministic
outcome reduces quickly with increasing n. At a critical value n_{c,r} the
outcome turns deterministic recovering the same result a universal suffrage
would yield. The scheme yields several social advantages like the distribution
of local power to the competing minority making the structure more resilient,
yet preserving the presidency allocation to the actual majority. An area is
produced around fifty percent for which the president is elected with an almost
equiprobability slightly biased in favor of the actual majority. However, our
results reveal the existence of a severe geometric vulnerability to lobbying. A
tiny lobbying group is able to kill the democratic balance by seizing the
presidency democratically. It is sufficient to complete a correlated
distribution of a few agents at the hierarchy bottom. Moreover, at the present
stage, identifying an actual killing distribution is not feasible, which sheds
a disturbing light on the devastating effect geometric lobbying can have on

  Coloring on Multicore Architectures","11 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In parallel computing, a valid graph coloring yields a lock-free processing
of the colored tasks, data points, etc., without expensive synchronization
mechanisms. However, coloring is not free and the overhead can be significant.
In particular, for the bipartite-graph partial coloring (BGPC) and distance-2
graph coloring (D2GC) problems, which have various use-cases within the
scientific computing and numerical optimization domains, the coloring overhead
can be in the order of minutes with a single thread for many real-life graphs.
  In this work, we propose parallel algorithms for bipartite-graph partial
coloring on shared-memory architectures. Compared to the existing shared-memory
BGPC algorithms, the proposed ones employ greedier and more optimistic
techniques that yield a better parallel coloring performance. In particular, on
16 cores, the proposed algorithms perform more than 4x faster than their
counterparts in the ColPack library which is, to the best of our knowledge, the
only publicly-available coloring library for multicore architectures. In
addition to BGPC, the proposed techniques are employed to devise parallel
distance-2 graph coloring algorithms and similar performance improvements have
been observed. Finally, we propose two costless balancing heuristics for BGPC
that can reduce the skewness and imbalance on the cardinality of color sets
(almost) for free. The heuristics can also be used for the D2GC problem and in
general, they will probably yield a better color-based parallelization
performance especially on many-core architectures.

In order to provide a dataset that bridges the time gap between the Gaia-DR1

between Gaia-DR1 and ground-based astrometry, featuring proper motions (but no
parallaxes) for a large fraction of the DR1 objects. While not attempting to
compete with future Gaia releases in terms of data quality or number of
objects, the aim of HSOY is to provide improved proper motions partly based on
Gaia data, allowing some studies to be carried out just now or as pilot studies
for later larger projects requiring higher-precision data. The HSOY catalogue
was compiled using the positions taken from Gaia-DR1 combined with the input
data from the PPMXL catalogue, employing the same weighted least-squares
technique that was used to assemble the PPMXL catalogue itself. Results. This
effort resulted in a four-parameter astrometric catalogue containing
583,000,000 objects, with Gaia-DR1 quality positions and proper motions with
precisions from significantly less than 1 mas/yr to 5 mas/yr, depending on the
object's brightness and location on the sky.

a very complicated field. This is why we needed a second hypothesis: Could we
work with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things with a good accuracy to
automate or semi-automate this kind of events? The demonstration of these

change of the non-local SSE voltage at a characteristic strip separation d0, in
agreement with previous investigations. At lower temperatures however, we find
a strong temperature dependence of d0. This suggests that both the angular
momentum transfer across the YIG/Pt interface as well as the transport
mechanism of the magnons in YIG as a function of temperature must be taken into

behavior of rule applications is non-termination or failure of a computation.
We propose a static program analysis of the non-termination problem for
recursion in the Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language.
  CHR is an advanced concurrent declarative language involving constraint
reasoning. It has been closely related to many other rule-based approaches, so
the results are of a more general interest. In such languages, non-termination
is due to infinite applications of recursive rules. Failure is due to
accumulation of contradicting constraints during the computation.
  We give theorems with so-called misbehavior conditions for potential
non-termination and failure (as well as definite termination) of linear direct
recursive simplification rules. Logical relationships between the constraints
in a recursive rule play a crucial role in this kind of program analysis. We
think that our approach can be extended to other types of recursion and to a
more general class of rules. Therefore this paper can serve as a basic
reference and a starting point for further research.

the proper-times along their individual world lines, are different when they
are located at remote parts of the spaceship. The age, or proper-time,

using different methods, especially those from information or dynamical system
theory. These studies revealed the dependence on different states of
consciousness, particularly that wakefulness is characterized by larger
complexity of brain signals perhaps due to the necessity of the brain to handle
varied sensorimotor information. Thus these frameworks are very useful in
attempts at quantifying cognitive states. We set out to analyze different types
of signals including scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG), and
magnetoencephalography (MEG) in subjects during different states of
consciousness: awake, sleep stages and epileptic seizures. The signals were
analyzed using a statistical (Permutation Entropy) and a deterministic
(Permutation Lempel Ziv Complexity) analytical method. The results are
presented in a complexity vs entropy graph, showing that the values of entropy
and complexity of the signals tend to be greatest when the subjects are in
fully alert states, falling in states with loss of awareness or consciousness.
These results are robust for all three types of recordings. We propose that the
investigation of the structure of cognition using the frameworks of complexity
will reveal mechanistic aspects of brain dynamics associated not only with
altered states of consciousness but also with normal and pathological
conditions.

metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted substantial scientific interest.
Due to the propensity of TMDCs to show exclusively one type of conductivity, n-
or p-type, heterojunctions of different materials are typically fabricated to
produce diode-like current rectification and photovoltaic response. Recently,
artificial, stable and substitutional doping of MoS2 into n- and p-type has
been demonstrated. MoS2 is an interesting material to use for optoelectronic
applications due to the potential of low-cost production in large quantities,
strong light-matter interactions and chemical stability. Here we report the
characterization of the optoelectronic properties of vertical homojunctions
made by stacking few-layer flakes of MoS2:Fe (n-type) and MoS2:Nb (p-type). The
junctions exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.7 %, a maximum open
circuit voltage of 0.51 V, they are stable in air and their rectification
characteristics and photovoltaic response are in excellent agreement to the
Shockley diode model. The gate-tunability of the maximum output power, the
ideality factor and the shunt resistance indicate that the dark current is
dominated by trap-assisted recombination and that the photocurrent collection
depends strongly on the spatial extent of the space charge region. We
demonstrate a response time faster than 80 ms and highlight the potential to
integrate such devices into quasi-transparent and flexible optoelectronics.

"1702.05674","Gilles Horowitz","Gilles Horowitz","Drift-diffusion current in organic diodes",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Because the conductivity of organic semiconductors is very low, a useful
model for the organic diode consists of treating the organic layer as an
insulator, an approximation often referred to as the metal-insulator-metal
(MIM) model. Moreover, the dominant charge carrier injection process is
diffusion, so that a modified Schottky theory can be used to derive a simple
analytical equation for the current voltage curve of the diode. Here, we
carried out a full analysis of the MIM model for the organic diode. We show
that Schottky theory is only valid when charge injection is poor, that is, for
high injection barriers. When the injection barrier is lowered, the current
given by Schottky theory is still valid in the weak injection regime, when the
applied potential is lower than the diffusion potential. However, it becomes
largely overestimated in the strong injection regime. We also show that in the
strong injection regime, the current given by the MIM model merges with
Mott-Gurnery space-charge-limited regime.

grouping efficiency as an objective function. We present a heuristic approach
for obtaining high-quality solutions of the CFP. The suggested heuristic
applies an improvement procedure to obtain solutions with high grouping
efficiency. This procedure is repeated many times for randomly generated cell
configurations. Our computational experiments are performed for popular
benchmark instances taken from the literature with sizes from 10x20 to 50x150.
Better solutions unknown before are found for 23 instances of the 24
