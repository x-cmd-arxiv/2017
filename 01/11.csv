pieces, each referring to a certain question, that these pieces can be combined
or aggregated and that the part relating to a given question can be extracted.
This algebraic structure can be given different forms. Questions were
originally represented by subsets of variables. Pieces of information were then
represented by valuations associated with the domains of variables. This leads
to an algebraic structure called valuation algebras. The basic axiomatics of
this algebraic structure was in essence proposed by Shenoy and Shafer. Here a
much more general view of systems of questions is proposed and pieces of
information are related to the elements of this system of questions. This leads
to a new and extended system of axioms for information algebras. Classical
valuation algebras are essentially a special case of this new system. A full
discussion of the algebraic theory of this new information algebras is given,
including local computation, duality between labeled and domain-free versions
of the algebras, order of information, finiteness of information and
approximation, compact and continuous information algebras. Finally a rather
complete discussion of uncertain information, based on random maps into
information algebras is presented. This is shown to represent a generalisation
of classical Dempster-Shafer theory.

use the sequence of predicted inputs from the previous time step as a warm
start, and to iteratively update this sequence by changing its elements one by
one, starting from the last predicted input and ending with the first predicted
input. This strategy, which resembles the dynamic programming principle, allows
for parallelization up to a certain level and yields a suboptimal nonlinear MPC
algorithm with guaranteed recursive feasibility, stability and improved cost
function at every iteration, which is suitable for real-time implementation.
The complexity of the algorithm per each time step in the prediction horizon
depends only on the horizon, the number of samples and parallel threads, and it
is independent of the measured system state. Comparisons with the fmincon
nonlinear optimization solver on benchmark examples indicate that as the
simulation time progresses, the proposed algorithm converges rapidly to the
""optimal"" solution, even when using a small number of samples.

Thanks to the large c.m. energies and enormous luminosities (plus clean

Measurement of the Higgs Yukawa couplings to the lightest fermions: u,d,s
quarks (via rare exclusive $H\to(\rho,\omega,\phi)+\gamma$ decays); and e$^\pm$
(via resonant s-channel $e^+e^-\to H$ production); as well as neutrinos (within
low-scale seesaw mass generation scenarios); (ii) Measurement of the Higgs
potential (triple $\lambda_3$, and quartic $\lambda_4$ self-couplings), via
double and triple Higgs boson production in pp collisions at 100 TeV; (iii)
Searches for new physics coupled to the scalar SM sector at scales $\Lambda>$ 6
TeV, thanks to measurements of the Higgs boson couplings with subpercent
uncertainties in $e^+e^-\to H\,Z$; and (iv) Searches for dark matter in
Higgs-portal interactions, via high-precision measurements of on-shell and
off-shell Higgs boson invisible decays. All these measurements are beyond the
reach of pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. New higher-energy $e^+e^-$

the past century in regard to its importance for Earth surface processes such
as natural riverbed morphological evolution. In the present contribution, the
influence of the longitudinal channel inclination angle on gravity-driven
turbulent bedload transport is studied in an idealised framework considering
steady and uniform flow conditions. From an analytical analysis based on the
two-phase continuous equations, it is shown that : (i) the classical slope
correction of the critical Shields number is based on an erroneous formulation
of the buoyancy force, (ii) the influence of the slope is not restricted to the
critical Shields number but affects the whole transport formula and (iii)
pressure-driven and gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport are not
equivalent from the slope influence standpoint. Analysing further the granular
flow driving mechanisms, the longitudinal slope is shown to not only influence
the fluid bed shear stress and the resistance of the granular bed, but also to
affect the fluid flow inside the granular bed - responsible for the transition
from bedload transport to debris flow. The relative influence of these coupled
mechanisms allows us to understand the evolution of the vertical structure of
the granular flow and to predict the transport rate scaling law as a function
of a rescaled Shields number. The theoretical analysis is validated with
coupled fluid-discrete element simulations of idealised gravity-driven
turbulent bedload transport, performed over a wide range of Shields number
values, density ratios and channel inclination angles. In particular, all the
data are shown to collapse onto a master curve when considering the sediment
transport rate as a function of the proposed rescaled Shields number.

design, especially in ocean engineering. The contours help engineers to select
the environmental states which are appropriate for structural design
calculations. Defining an environmental contour means enclosing a region in the
variable space which corresponds to a certain return period. However, there are
multiple definitions and methods to calculate an environmental contour for a
given return period. Here, we analyze the established approaches and present a
new concept which we call highest density contour (HDC). We define this
environmental contour to enclose the highest density region (HDR) of a given
probability density. This region occupies the smallest possible volume in the
variable space among all regions with the same included probability, which is
advantageous for engineering design. We perform the calculations using a
numerical grid to discretize the original variable space into a finite number
of grid cells. Each cell's probability is estimated and used for numerical
integration. The proposed method can be applied to any number of dimensions,
i.e. number of different variables in the joint probability model. To put the
highest density contour method in context, we compare it to the established
inverse first-order reliability method (IFORM) and show that for common
probability distributions the two methods yield similarly shaped contours. In
multimodal probability distributions, however, where IFORM leads to contours
which are dificult to interpret, the presented method still generates clearly
defined contours.

IP-based TV content is rapidly increasing. Consumers demand uninterrupted
service with a high Quality of Experience (QoE). Service providers are
constantly trying to differentiate themselves by innovating new ways of

In this work, we propose a cost-efficient wireless framework (WiLiTV) for
delivering live TV services, consisting of a mix of wireless access
technologies (e.g. Satellite, WiFi and LTE overlay links). In the proposed
architecture, live TV content is injected into the network at a few residential
locations using satellite dishes. The content is then further distributed to
other homes using a house-to-house WiFi network or via an overlay LTE network.
Our problem is to construct an optimal TV distribution network with the minimum
number of satellite injection points, while preserving the highest QoE, for
different neighborhood densities. We evaluate the framework using realistic
time-varying demand patterns and a diverse set of home location data. Our study
demonstrates that the architecture requires 75 - 90% fewer satellite injection
points, compared to traditional architectures. Furthermore, we show that most
cost savings can be obtained using simple and practical relay routing
solutions.

formed in the accretion column, close to the WD photosphere above the impact
region. We present optical observations of the polar V834 Centauri performed
with the fast ULTRACAM camera mounted on the ESO-VLT simultaneously in three
filters (u', He II 4686A, r') to study these oscillations and characterise
their properties along the orbit. Fast Fourier transforms and wavelet analysis
have been performed and the mean frequency, rms amplitude, and coherence of the
QPOs are derived; a detailed inspection of individual pulses has also been
performed. The observations confirm the probable ubiquity of the QPOs for this
source at all epochs when the source is in a high state, with observed mean
amplitude of 2.1 percent (r'), 1.5 percent (He II), and 0.6 percent (u').
Trains of oscillations are clearly observed in the r' light curve and can be
mimicked by a superposition of damped sinusoids with various parameters. The
QPO energy distribution is comparable to that of the cyclotron flux, consistent
for the r' and He II filters but requiring a significant dilution in the u'
filter. New 1D hydrodynamical simulations of shock instabilities, adapted to
the physical parameters of V834 Cen, can account for the optical QPO amplitude
and X-ray upper limit assuming a cross section of the accretion column in the
range (4-5) E14 cm2. However, the predicted frequency is larger than the
observed one by an order of magnitude. This shortcoming indicates that the QPO
generation is more complex than that produced in a homogeneous column and calls
for a more realistic 3D treatment of the accretion flow in future modelling.

optimal control solutions and their characterization as solutions to Kohn-Sham
TDDFT optimality systems are discussed. To validate this control framework, a

opponent but in order to determine the validity of the claim. We are interested
in a devil's advocate that argues against termination of a program. He does so
by producing a maleficent program that can cause the non-termination of the
original program. By inspecting and running the malicious program, one may gain
insight into the potential reasons for non-termination and produce
counterexamples for termination.
  We introduce our method using the concurrent programming language Constraint
Handling Rules (CHR). Like in other declarative languages, non-termination
occurs through unbounded recursion. Given a self-recursive rule, we
automatically generate one or more devil's rules from it. The construction of
the devil's rules is straightforward and involves no guessing. The devil's
rules can be simple. For example, they are non-recursive for rules with single
recursion.
  We show that the devil's rules are maximally vicious in the following sense:
For any program that contains the self-recursive rule and for any infinite
computation through that rule in that program, there is a corresponding
infinite computation with the recursive rule and the devil's rules alone. In
that case, the malicious rules serve as a finite witness for non-termination.
On the other hand, if the devil's rules do not exhibit an infinite computation,
the recursive rule is unconditionally terminating. We also identify cases where
the static analysis of the devil's rule decides termination or non-termination
of the recursive rule.

extracting the value of the correlator $\langle\hat{O}^i(t)

operators which couple the system to its environment. The ideal correlator can
be straightforwardly reconstructed by using statistical knowledge of the
environment, if any $n$-time correlator of operators $\hat{O}^i$ of the ideal
system can be written as products of two-time correlators. We give an approach
to verify the validity of this assumption experimentally by additional
measurements on the perturbed quantum simulator. The proposed method can allow
for reliable quantum simulations with systems subjected to environmental noise

major merger, which consist of two protogalaxies on a collision orbit. We show
that such merger simulations can produce a non-realistic central mass
concentration, and we propose simple, parametric, AGN-like feedback as a
solution to this problem. Our AGN-like feedback algorithm is very simple: at
each time-step we take all particles whose local volume density is above a
given threshold value and increase their temperature to a preset value. We also
compare the GADGET3 and GIZMO codes, by applying both of them to the same
initial conditions. Results: We show that the evolution of isolated
protogalaxies resembles the evolution of disk galaxies, thus arguing that our
protogalaxies are well suited for our merger simulations. We demonstrate that
the problem with the unphysical central mass concentration in our merger
simulations is further aggravated when we increase the resolution. We show that
our AGN-like feedback removes this non-physical central mass concentration, and
thus allows the formation of realistic bars. Note that our AGN-like feedback
mainly affects the central region of a model, without significantly modifying
the rest of the galaxy. We demonstrate that, in the context of our kind of
simulation, GADGET3 gives results which are very similar to those obtained with
the PSPH (density independent SPH) flavor of GIZMO. Moreover, in the examples
we tried, the differences between the results of the two flavors of GIZMO,

scale lengths than the inner disc scale length region. Our sample indicates
that this behaviour happens to more than 75% of the galaxies fitted with an NFW

instance those with $M_*\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\odot$. Besides the tests on the
homogeneity of the fits, we also use a sample of 62 galaxies of diverse types
to perform tests on the quality of the overall fit of each galaxy, and to
search for correlations with stellar mass, gas mass and the disc scale length.

and that even for the galaxies with $M_* \gtrsim 10^{10} M_\odot$ the Burkert
profile either fits as good as, or better than, the NFW profile. This result is
relevant since different baryonic effects important for the smaller galaxies,
like supernova feedback and dynamical friction from baryonic clumps, indicate
that at such large stellar masses the NFW profile should be preferred over the
Burkert profile. Hence, our results either suggest a new baryonic effect or a

component for isolating and controlling light in photonic systems.
Optomechanical systems have emerged as a potential platform for optical
non-reciprocity, due to ability of a pump laser to break time and parity
symmetry in the system. Here we consider how the non-reciprocal behavior of
light can also impact the transport of sound in optomechanical devices. We
focus on the case of a quasi one dimensional optical ring resonator with many
mechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto-optic effect. The addition of
disorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material,
largely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter-clockwise
phonons. We show that a laser pump field, along with the assumption of high
quality-factor, sideband-resolved optical resonances, suppresses the effects of
disorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion, with
direction-dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the
phase-matching bandwidth for Brillouin scattering. A simple diagrammatic theory
connects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the
associated phonon diffusion properties, and helps explain recent experimental
results.

pnictides. The 112-phase has gained augmented attention due to the recent
discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in $\cl$ with a maximum
critical temperature $\tc\sim$ 47\,K upon Sb substitution. The structural,
magnetic, and electronic properties of $\cl$ bear some similarities with other
superconducting pnictide phases, however, the different valence states of the
pnictogen and the presence of a metallic spacer layer are unique features of
the 112-system. Low-temperature superconductivity which coexists with
antiferromagnetic order was observed in transition metal (Ni, Pd) deficient
112-compounds like $\cn$, $\lpb$, $\lps$, $\lns$. Besides superconductivity,
the presence of naturally occurring anisotropic Dirac Fermionic states were
observed in the layered 112-compounds $\smb$, $\cmb$, $\lab$ which are of
significant interest for future nanoelectronics as an alternative to graphene.
In these compounds, the linear energy dispersion resulted in a high
magnetoresistance that stayed unsaturated even at the highest applied magnetic
fields. Here, we describe various 112-type materials systems combining
experimental results and theoretical predictions to stimulate further research
on this less well-known member of the pnictide family.

mimic a distributed storage of a set of $n$ data items on $m$ servers, in such
a way that any batch of $k$ data items can be retrieved by reading at most some
$t$ symbols from each server. Combinatorial batch codes, are replication-based
batch codes in which each server stores a subset of the data items.
  In this paper, we propose a generalization of combinatorial batch codes,
called multiset combinatorial batch codes (MCBC), in which $n$ data items are
stored in $m$ servers, such that any multiset request of $k$ items, where any
item is requested at most $r$ times, can be retrieved by reading at most $t$

recent work on codes which enable high availability and parallel reads in
distributed storage systems. The main problem under this paradigm is to
minimize the number of items stored in the servers, given the values of
$n,m,k,r,t$, which is denoted by $N(n,k,m,t;r)$. We first give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of MCBCs. Then, we present several
bounds on $N(n,k,m,t;r)$ and constructions of MCBCs. In particular, we
determine the value of $N(n,k,m,1;r)$ for any $n\geq
\left\lfloor\frac{k-1}{r}\right\rfloor{m\choose k-1}-(m-k+1)A(m,4,k-2)$, where
$A(m,4,k-2)$ is the maximum size of a binary constant weight code of length
$m$, distance four and weight $k-2$. We also determine the exact value of
$N(n,k,m,1;r)$ when $r\in\{k,k-1\}$ or $k=m$.

those features critically depend on the availability of the program source

detect a young low-mass companion to a T Tauri star. AS 205A is a late-type
dwarf (~K5) of ~1 Msun that belongs to a triple system. Independent photometric
surveys discovered that AS 205A has two distinct periods (P1=6.78 and P2=24.78
days) detected in the light curve that persist over several years. Period P1
seems to be linked to the axial-rotation of the star and is caused by the
presence of cool surface spots. Period P2 is correlated with the modulation in
AS 205A brightness (V) and red color (V-R), consistent with a gravitating
object within the accretion disk. We here derive precise Near Infrared radial
velocities to investigate the origin of period P2 which is predicted to
correspond to a cool source in a Keplerian orbit with a semi-major axis of
~0.17 AU positioned close to the inner disk radius of 0.14 AU. The radial
velocity variations of AS 205A were found to have a period of P ~ 24.84 days
and a semi-amplitude of 1.529 kms-1. This result closely resembles the P2
period in past photometric observations (P ~ 24.78 days). The analysis of the
cross-correlation function bisector has shown no correlation with the radial
velocity modulations, strongly suggesting that the period is not controlled by
stellar rotation. Additional activity indicators should however be explored in
future surveys. Taking this into account we found that the presence of a
substellar companion is the explanation that best fits the results. We derived
an orbital solution for AS 205A and found evidence of a m2sini 19.25 MJup
object in an orbit with moderate eccentricity of e~0.34. If confirmed with
future observations, preferably using a multiwavelength survey approach, this
companion could provide interesting constraints on brown dwarf and planetary
formation models.

From the observations, we find 13 compact sources associated to 9 UCHII
regions. Although we cannot establish an unambiguous nature for the newly
detected sources, we assess some of their observational properties. According
to the results, we can distinguish between two types of compact sources. One
type corresponds to sources that probably are deeply embedded in the dense
ionized gas of the UCHII region. These sources are being photo-evaporated by
the exciting star of the region and will last for 10$^4-10^5$ yr. They may play
a crucial role in the evolution of the UCHII region as the photo-evaporated
material could replenish the expanding plasma and might provide a solution to
the so-called lifetime problem for these regions. The second type of compact
sources is not associated with the densest ionized gas of the region. A few of
these sources appear resolved and may be photo-evaporating objects such as
those of the first type but with significantly lower mass depletion rates. The
rest of sources of this second type appear unresolved and their properties are
varied. We speculate on the similarity between the sources of the second type
and those of the Orion population of radio sources.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing
spectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for
automatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems
incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models
(HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks.
Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it
feasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid
settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult
to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC
approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by
combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By
evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the
proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with
the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability
to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.

square patches across sufficiently long time gaps. Here, I use one month of
SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic field observations, combined with the SWAMIS
magnetic feature tracking algorithm to measure the motion of individual
features in these magnetograms. By controlling for perturbations due to
short-lived flows and due to false motions from feature interactions, I
effectively isolate the long-lived flows traced by the magnetic features. This
allows me to produce high-fidelity differential rotation measurements with
well-characterized variances and covariances of the fit parameters.I find a
sidereal rotational profile of
$(14.296\pm0.006)+(-1.847\pm0.056)\sin^{2}b+(-2.615\pm0.093)\sin^{4}b$, with

$\sigma_{BC}^{2}=-4.87\times10^{-3}(\textrm{ deg d}^{-1})^{2}$. I also produce
medium-fidelity measurements of the much weaker meridional flow that is broadly
consistent with previous results. This measurement shows a peak flow of
$16.7\pm0.6\text{ m s}^{-1}$ at latitude $b=45^\circ$ but is insufficiently
characterized at higher latitudes to ascertain whether the chosen functional
form $2\cos b\sin b$ is appropriate. This work shows that measuring the motions
of individual features in photospheric magnetograms can produce high precision
results in relatively short time spans, and suggests that high resolution
non-longitudinally averaged photospheric velocity residual measurements could

the stellar mass completeness at high $z$ with respect to previous UltraVISTA

selection, extending their SMF estimate up to $z=4$. Our work provides a
comprehensive view of galaxy stellar mass assembly between $z=0.1$ and 6, for
the first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We
fit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington
bias. We compare the SMF fit with the halo mass function predicted from
$\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that at $z>3$ both functions decline with a
similar slope in the high-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming
that the mechanisms that quench star formation in massive haloes become less
effective at high redshift; however further work needs to be done to confirm
this scenario. Concerning the SMF low-mass end, it shows a progressive
steepening as moving towards higher redshifts, with $\alpha$ decreasing from
$-1.47_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ at $z\simeq0.1$ to $-2.11_{-0.13}^{+0.30}$ at
$z\simeq5$. This slope depends on the characterisation of the observational
uncertainties, which is crucial to properly remove the Eddington bias. We show
that there is currently no consensus on the method to quantify such errors:
different error models result in different best-fit Schechter parameters.

The observed U-R gradients are consistent with a metallicity gradient (mean

efficiently produce UV emission. The data require either steady weak star
formation (< 1 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) or an He-rich population in the cores of

predicted by the present day CV population models ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} \simeq

period, CVs are expected to evolve back towards longer periods with mean
accretion rates $\dot{M}\lesssim 2 \times

comprehensive study that combines multi-wavelength data has been conducted so
far. Here we present rotationally resolved NIR spectra (0.7-2.5 microns) of
(16) Psyche obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. These data have
been combined with shape models of the asteroid for each rotation phase.
Spectral band parameters extracted from the NIR spectra show that the pyroxene
band center varies from ~ 0.92 to 0.94 microns. Band center values were used to
calculate the pyroxene chemistry of the asteroid, whose average value was found
to be Fs30En65Wo5. Variations in the band depth were also observed, with values
ranging from 1.0 to 1.5%. Using a new laboratory spectral calibration we
estimated an average orthopyroxene content of 6+/-1%. The mass-deficit region
of Psyche, which exhibits the highest radar albedo, also shows the highest
value for spectral slope and the minimum band depth. The spectral
characteristics of Psyche suggest that its parent body did not have the typical
structure expected for a differentiated body or that the sequence of events
that led to its current state was more complex than previously thought.

including star formation and feedback, we study how gas accretes onto these
different classes of objects that, for simplicity, we dub 'accreting' and
'stalled' haloes. We find that all haloes get a fresh supply of newly accreted
gas in their inner regions, although this slowly decreases with time, in
particular for the stalled haloes. The inflow of new gas is always higher than
(but comparable with) that of recycled material. Overall, the cold-gas fraction
increases (decreases) with time for the accreting (stalled) haloes. In all
cases, a stellar disc and a bulge form at the centre of the simulated haloes.
The total stellar mass is in excellent agreement with expectations based on the
abundance-matching technique. Many properties of the central galaxies do not
seem to correlate with the large-scale environment in which the haloes reside.
However, there are two notable exceptions that characterise stalled haloes with
respect to their accreting counterparts: i) the galaxy disc contains much older
stellar populations; ii) its vertical scale-height is larger by a factor of two
or more. This thickening is likely due to the heating of the long-lived discs
by mergers and close flybys.

emission lines from a faint counter-image, opposite to the main arc, at a

by a combination of stellar mass and a standard dark-matter halo. The
counter-image is not predicted in such models, unless the dark-matter component
is negligible, which would imply an extremely heavy stellar initial mass
function (IMF) in this galaxy. We consider two modifications to the model which
can produce the observed configuration without resorting to extreme IMFs.
Imposing a radial gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio, $\Upsilon$, can
generate a counter-image close to the observed position if $\Upsilon$ increases
by $\gtrsim$60 per cent within the inner $\sim$1 arcsec (e.g. variation from a
Milky-Way-like to a Salpeter-like IMF). Alternatively, the counter-image can be
produced by introducing a central super-massive black hole. The required mass

observations of Fermi-LAT exhibit a hardening of the gamma-ray spectrum at
around a hundred GeV, between the Sagittarius and Carina tangents, and a
further hardening at a few degrees above and below the Galactic plane. However,
standard CR propagation models that assume a time independent source
distribution and a location independent diffusion cannot give rise to a
spatially dependent CR (and hence gamma-ray) spectral slopes. Here we consider
a dynamic spiral arm model in which the distribution of CR sources is
concentrated in the (dynamic) spiral arms, and we study the effects of this

the Galactic arms the observed gamma-ray spectral slope is not trivially
related to the CR injection spectrum and energy dependence of the diffusion

radiative loss efficiency and to obtain post-shock temperatures and pressures
and thus entropies. The efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total
incoming energy flux which escapes the system (roughly the Hill sphere), taking
into account the energy recycling which occurs ahead of the shock in a
radiative precursor. We focus here on a constant equation of state to isolate
the shock physics but use constant and tabulated opacities. While robust
quantitative results will require a self-consistent treatment including
hydrogen dissocation and ionization, the results show the correct qualitative
behavior and can be understood semi-analytically. The shock is found to be
isothermal and supercritical for a range of conditions relevant to core
accretion (CA), with Mach numbers greater than ca. 3. Across the shock, the
entropy decreases significantly, by a few entropy units (k_B/baryon). While
nearly 100 percent of the incoming kinetic energy is converted to radiation
locally, the efficiencies are found to be as low as roughly 40 percent,
implying that a meaningful fraction of the total accretion energy is brought
into the planet. For realistic parameter combinations in the CA scenario, a
non-zero fraction of the luminosity always escapes the system. This luminosity
could explain, at least in part, recent observations in the LkCa 15 and HD

better than with 24 micron emission and anti-correlates with Halpha, so that
PAH emission may be an effective tracer of molecular gas at low metallicity.
The properties of the CO clumps resemble those of similar-size structures in
Galactic clouds except of slightly lower surface brightness and CO-to-H2 ratio
~1-2 times the Galactic value. The clumps exist inside larger atomic-molecular
complexes with masses typical for giant molecular cloud. Using dust to trace H2

that may track their evolutionary state. The H2-to-HI ratio is low globally and
only mildly above unity within the complexes. The SFR-to-H2 ratio is ~3-5 times
higher in the complexes than in massive disk galaxies, but after accounting for
the bias from targeting star-forming regions, we conclude that the global
molecular gas depletion time may be as long as in massive disk galaxies.

peculiarities present in the molecular and atomic gas are closely related with

pressure even if it is not stripped. CO is found to be modestly enhanced along
the upstream sides in these galaxies, which may change the local star formation
activity in the disc. Indeed, the distribution of H$\alpha$ emission, a tracer
of recent star formation, well coincides with that of the molecular gas,
revealing enhancements near the local CO peak or along the CO compression. FUV

these GWs are emitted from the quadrupole-deformed nuclear-density core, they
may encode information on the uncertain nuclear equation of state (EOS). We
examine the effects of the nuclear EOS on GWs from rotating core collapse and
carry out 1824 axisymmetric general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations that
cover a parameter space of 98 different rotation profiles and 18 different EOS.
We show that the bounce GW signal is largely independent of the EOS and
sensitive primarily to the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy, and at
high rotation rates, to the degree of differential rotation. The GW frequency
of postbounce core oscillations shows stronger EOS dependence that can be
parameterized by the core's EOS-dependent dynamical frequency
$\sqrt{G\bar{\rho}_c}$. We find that the ratio of the peak frequency to the
dynamical frequency follows a universal trend that is obeyed by all EOS and
rotation profiles and that indicates that the nature of the core oscillations
changes when the rotation rate exceeds the dynamical frequency. We find that
differences in the treatments of low-density nonuniform nuclear matter, of the
transition from nonuniform to uniform nuclear matter, and in the description of
nuclear matter up to around twice saturation density can mildly affect the GW
signal. We find that approximations and uncertainties in electron capture rates
can lead to variations in the GW signal that are of comparable magnitude to
those due to different nuclear EOS. This emphasizes the need for reliable
nuclear electron capture rates and for self-consistent multi-dimensional

field for the nearby young stars are significantly different from that for the

The residual velocity field shows that the young stars consistently move along

leading side, they move slower in azimuth direction. At both sides, the young
stars averagely move inward with $v_R$ of $-5\sim-3$ km s$^{-1}$. The
divergence of the velocity in $Y$ direction implies that the young stars are
associated with a density wave nearby the local arm. We therefore suggest that
the young stars may reflect the formation of the local spiral arm by
correlating themselves with a density wave. The range of the age for the young

nuclear explosions, controlled nuclear energy, and nuclear fusion. The review
then moves to focus on modern applications of these concepts, including the
basic concepts and diagnostics developed for the forensics of nuclear
explosions, the nuclear diagnostics at the National Ignition Facility, nuclear
reactor safeguards, and the detection of nuclear material production and
trafficking. The review also summarizes recent developments in nuclear
geophysics and nuclear medicine. The nuclear geophysics areas discussed include
geo-chronology, nuclear logging for industry, the Oklo reactor, and
geo-neutrinos. The section on nuclear medicine summarizes the critical advances
in nuclear imaging, including PET and SPECT imaging, targeted radionuclide
therapy, and the nuclear physics of medical isotope production. Each subfield
discussed requires a review article onto itself, which is not the intention of
the current review. Rather, the current review is intended for readers who wish
to get a broad understanding of applied nuclear physics.

quenches from thermal equilibrium states. For the former, we calculate
observables in the grand canonical ensemble, and for the latter we calculate

the thermodynamic limit. We use two different NLCEs - a maximally connected
expansion introduced in previous works and a site-based expansion. We compare
the effectiveness of both NLCEs. The site-based NLCE is found to work best for
systems in thermal equilibrium. However, in thermal equilibrium and after
quantum quenches, the site-based NLCE can diverge when the maximally connected
one converges. We relate this divergence to the exponentially large number of
clusters in the site-based NLCE and the behavior of the weights of observables
in those clusters. We discuss the effectiveness of resummations to cure the
divergence. Our NLCE calculations are compared to exact diagonalization ones in
lattices with periodic boundary conditions. NLCEs are found to outperform exact
diagonalization in periodic systems for all quantities studied.

to formation of coherent ""dark"" nuclear spin states but experimental
verification is lacking, especially due to the poor accuracy of polarization

quantum dots with high accuracy using a new approach enabled by manipulation of
the nuclear spin states with radiofrequency pulses. Polarizations up to 80% are
observed - the highest reported so far for optical cooling in quantum dots.
This value is still not limited by nuclear coherence effects. Instead we find
that optically cooled nuclei are well described within a classical spin
temperature framework. Our findings unlock a route for further progress towards
quantum dot electron spin qubits where deep cooling of the mesoscopic nuclear
spin ensemble is used to achieve long qubit coherence. Moreover, GaAs hyperfine

peak frequencies. The distribution of the optically thick spectral indices of
our sample is consistent with past GPS/CSS samples but with a large dispersion,
suggesting that the spectral peak is a product of an inhomogeneous environment
that is individualistic. We find no dependence of observed peak frequency with
redshift, consistent with the peaked-spectrum sample comprising both local CSS
sources and high-redshift GPS sources. The 5 GHz luminosity distribution lacks
the brightest GPS and CSS sources of previous samples, implying that a
convolution of source evolution and redshift influences the type of
peaked-spectrum sources identified below 1 GHz. Finally, we discuss sources

interest as a spin-triplet superconductor with an order parameter that may
potentially break time reversal invariance and host half-quantized vortices
with Majorana zero modes. While the actual nature of the superconducting state
is still a matter of controversy, it has long been believed that it condenses
from a metallic state that is well described by a conventional Fermi liquid. In
this work we use a combination of Fourier transform scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (FT-STS) and momentum resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
(M-EELS) to probe interaction effects in the normal state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our
high-resolution FT-STS data show signatures of the \beta-band with a distinctly
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) character. The band dispersion reveals surprisingly
strong interaction effects that dramatically renormalize the Fermi velocity,
suggesting that the normal state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is that of a 'correlated
metal' where correlations are strengthened by the quasi 1D nature of the bands.
In addition, kinks at energies of approximately 10meV, 38meV and 70meV are
observed. By comparing STM and M-EELS data we show that the two higher energy
features arise from coupling with collective modes. The strong correlation
effects and the kinks in the quasi 1D bands may provide important information
for understanding the superconducting state. This work opens up a unique
approach to revealing the superconducting order parameter in this compound.

confining pressure is either thermal pressure acting on both surfaces, or
thermal pressure acting on one surface and ram-pressure on the other. In the
linear regime of fragmentation, the dispersion relation we obtain agrees well
with that derived by Elmegreen & Elmegreen (1978), and consequently deviates
from the dispersion relations based on the thin shell approximation (Vishniac
1983) or pressure assisted gravitational instability (W\""unsch et al. 2010). In
the non-linear regime, the relative importance of the confining pressure to the
self-gravity is a crucial parameter controlling the qualitative course of
fragmentation. When confinement of the layer is dominated by external pressure,
self- gravitating condensations are delivered by a two-stage process: first the
layer fragments into gravitationally bound but stable clumps, and then these
clumps coalesce until they assemble enough mass to collapse. In contrast, when
external pressure makes a small contribution to confinement of the layer, the
layer fragments monolithically into gravitationally unstable clumps and there
is no coalescence. This dichotomy persists whether the external pressure is
thermal or ram. We apply these results to fragments forming in a shell swept up
by an expanding H II region, and find that, unless the swept up gas is quite
hot or the surrounding medium has low density, the fragments have low-mass ( ~<
3 M_Sun ), and therefore they are unlikely to spawn stars that are sufficiently
massive to promote sequential self-propagating star formation.

atmospheric circulation on these objects. Directly imaged planets share similar
observations, and can be viewed as low-gravity versions of brown dwarfs.
Vigorous condensate cycles of chemical species in their atmospheres are
inferred by observations and theoretical studies, and latent heating associated
with condensation is expected to be important in shaping atmospheric
circulation and influencing cloud patchiness. We present a qualitative
description of the mechanisms by which condensational latent heating influence
the circulation, and then illustrate them using an idealized general
circulation model that includes a condensation cycle of silicates with latent
heating and molecular weight effect due to rainout of condensate. Simulations
with conditions appropriate for typical T dwarfs exhibit the development of
localized storms and east-west jets. The storms are spatially inhomogeneous,
evolving on timescale of hours to days and extending vertically from the
condensation level to the tropopause. The fractional area of the brown dwarf
covered by active storms is small. Based on a simple analytic model, we
quantitatively explain the area fraction of moist plumes, and show its
dependence on radiative timescale and convective available potential energy. We
predict that, if latent heating dominates cloud formation processes, the
fractional coverage area by clouds decreases as the spectral type goes through
the L/T transition from high to lower effective temperature. This is a natural
consequence of the variation of radiative timescale and convective available
potential energy with spectral type.

can generate a spontaneous surface thermal quantum Hall effect (TQHE). By
contrast, nonmagnetic quenched disorder induces a surface conformal field
theory (CFT) that is stable against weak interactions: topological protection
is enhanced by disorder. Gapless surface states of higher-spin TSCs could
therefore be robustly realized in solid state systems, where disorder is
inevitable. The surface CFT is characterized by universal signatures that
depend only on the bulk topological winding number, and include power-law
scaling of the density of states, a universal multifractal spectrum of local

distance which depends on their energy. Thus, detecting neutrons in space in
principle provides directional and distance information. Apart from secondary
neutrons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the Earth atmosphere, which are
the dominant background, direct neutron emission is caused by solar flares,
with clear time correlation with X-rays, which can be measured from few tens
MeV up to few GeV. There is no detectable astrophysical source up to the PeV
scale, when neutrons coming from supernova remnants may reach the Earth before
decaying. In addition, ultra high energy neutrons are the most plausible
explanation for the measured anisotropy of cosmic-ray showers produced in the
atmosphere above $10^{18}$ eV. From the GeV to the PeV scale, the expected
neutron flux is very low and not too different from the antiproton flux, as the
same cosmic-ray collisions with the interstellar medium which can produce
antiprotons can also produce neutrons and antineutrons. This background flux of
cosmic-ray neutrons is very low and has not yet been detected. Measuring the
neutron energy spectrum in space is a very effective way of searching for
decays of exotic particles. For example, dark matter could consist of Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which may annihilate into final states

First, we give a number of combinatorial characteri\-zations of almost acyclic

with bounded short cycles is closely related to the connec\-ting component of a

scale invariant pattern. These patterns are considered efficient for hunting or

scale invariant pattern of inter-touch intervals on the smartphone to optimal
strategies for information gathering. We recorded touchscreen touches in 65
individuals for a month and categorized the activity into checking for
information vs. sharing content. For both categories, the inter-touch intervals
were well described by power-law fits spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 1 s
to several hours. The power-law exponent typically found for checking was 1.5
and for generating it was 1.3. Next, by using computer simulations we addressed
whether the checking pattern was efficient - in terms of minimizing futile
attempts yielding no new information. We find that the best performing power
law exponent depends on the duration of the assessment and the exponent of 1.5
was the most efficient in the short-term i.e. in the few minutes range.
Finally, we addressed whether how people generated and shared content was in
tune with the checking pattern. We assumed that the unchecked posts must be
minimized for maximal efficiency and according to our analysis the most
efficient temporal pattern to share content was the exponent of 1.3 - which was
also the pattern displayed by the smartphone users. The behavioral organization
for content generation is different from content consumption across time
scales. We propose that this difference is a signature of optimal behavior and
the short-term assessments used in modern human actions.

give rise to an enormously rich (and largely unexplored) space of
two-dimensional critical theories in the thermodynamic limit. One remarkable
feature of these systems is the appearance of non-local microscopic
""topological symmetries"" that descend to topological defects of the resulting
CFTs. We derive various model-independent properties of these theories and of
this topological symmetry / topological defect correspondence. For example, by
studying precursors of certain twist and defect fields directly in the anyonic
chains, we argue that (under mild assumptions) the two-dimensional CFTs
correspond to particular modular invariants with respect to their maximal
chiral algebras and that the topological defects descending from topological
symmetries commute with these maximal chiral algebras. Using this map, we apply
properties of defect Hilbert spaces to show how topological symmetries give a
handle on the set of allowed relevant deformations of these theories.
Throughout, we give a unified perspective that treats the constraints from
discrete symmetries on the same footing as the constraints from topological

from high-resolution observations acquired with the Sunrise balloon-borne solar

their width. The oscillatory behaviors are investigated at several positions
along the axes of the SCFs. A large majority of fibrils show signs of
oscillations in intensity. Their periods and phase speeds are analyzed using a
wavelet analysis. The width and intensity perturbations have overlapping
distributions of the wave period.
  The obtained distributions have median values of the period of $32\pm17$s and
$36\pm25$s, respectively. We find that the fluctuations of both parameters
propagate in the SCFs with speeds of ${11}^{+49}_{-11}$ km/s and
${15}^{+34}_{-15}$ km/s, respectively. Furthermore, the width and intensity
oscillations have a strong tendency to be either in anti-phase, or, to a
smaller extent, in phase. This suggests that the oscillations of both
parameters are caused by the same wave mode and that the waves are likely
propagating. Taking all the evidence together, the most likely wave mode to
explain all measurements and criteria is the fast sausage mode.

reduction in the energy of recoils. Upon reaching the collision diameters of

deployment and management of eMBMS systems is challenging, due to the lack of
realtime feedback from the User Equipment (UEs). Therefore, we present the
Dynamic Monitoring (DyMo) system for low-overhead feedback collection. DyMo
leverages eMBMS for broadcasting Stochastic Group Instructions to all UEs.
These instructions indicate the reporting rates as a function of the observed
Quality of Service (QoS). This simple feedback mechanism collects very limited
QoS reports from the UEs. The reports are used for network optimization,
thereby ensuring high QoS to the UEs. We present the design aspects of DyMo and
evaluate its performance analytically and via extensive simulations.
Specifically, we show that DyMo infers the optimal eMBMS settings with
extremely low overhead, while meeting strict QoS requirements under different
UE mobility patterns and presence of network component failures. For instance,
DyMo can detect the eMBMS Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) experienced by the 0.1%

satisfying $\chi(s)\leq K(a+s)^{-k}$ for some $k\geq 1$ and $a\geq 0$. In the
case that $k=1$, Fujie (J. Math. Anal. Appl.; 2015; 424; 675--684) established
global existence of bounded solutions under the condition
$K<\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}$. On the other hand, when $k>1$, Winkler (Math. Nachr.;
2010; 283; 1664--1673) asserted global existence of bounded solutions for
arbitrary $K>0$. However, there is a gap in the proof. Recently, Fujie tried
modifying the proof; nevertheless it also has a gap. It seems to be difficult
to show global existence of bounded solutions for arbitrary $K>0$. Moreover,
the condition for $K$ when $k>1$ cannot connect to the condition when $k=1$.
The purpose of the present paper is to obtain global existence and boundedness
under more natural and proper condition for $\chi$ and to build a mathematical
bridge between the cases $k=1$ and $k>1$.

in this direction, however, is limited by the lack of a comprehensive

integrate them into the graph-based manifold ranking algorithm to achieve
adaptive fusion of different source data. Moreover, we incorporate the

retrieval, arises in many scientific fields. One of many examples is
ultra-short laser pulse characterization in which the electromagnetic field is
oscillating with ~10^15 Hz and phase information cannot be measured directly
due to limitations of the electronic sensors. Phase retrieval is ill-posed in
most cases as there are many different signals with the same Fourier transform
magnitude. To overcome this fundamental ill-posedness, several measurement
techniques are used in practice. One of the most popular methods for complete
characterization of ultra-short laser pulses is the Frequency-Resolved Optical
Gating (FROG). In FROG, the acquired data is the power spectrum of the product
of the unknown pulse with its delayed replica. Therefore the measured signal is
a quartic function of the unknown pulse. A generalized version of FROG, where
the delayed replica is replaced by a second unknown pulse, is called blind
FROG. In this case, the measured signal is quadratic with respect to both
pulses. In this letter we introduce and formulate FROG-type techniques. We then
show that almost all band-limited signals are determined uniquely, up to
trivial ambiguities, by blind FROG measurements (and thus also by FROG), if in

short-range directional interactions, while the solute particles have
short-range isotropic interactions. The hard-sphere mixture without any
association site forms the reference fluid. An important ingredient within the
multi-body association theory is the description of clustering of the reference
solvent around the reference solute. Here we account for the physical,
multi-body clusters of the reference solvent around the reference solute in
terms of occupancy statistics in a defined observation volume. These occupancy
probabilities are obtained from enhanced sampling simulations, but we also
present statistical mechanical models to estimate these probabilities with
limited simulation data. Relative to an approach that describes only up to
three-body correlations in the reference, incorporating the complete reference
information better predicts the bonding state and thermodynamics of the
physical solute for a wide range of system conditions. Importantly, analysis of
the residual chemical potential of the infinitely dilute solute from molecular
simulation and theory shows that whereas the chemical potential is somewhat
insensitive to the description of the structure of the reference fluid the
energetic and entropic contributions are not, with the results from the
complete reference approach being in better agreement with particle

important applications in different fields in science and engineering. Existing
methods are majorly based on discretization of manifolds as implicit functions,
triangle meshes, or point clouds, where the manifold structure is approximated

differential operators only based on point-wisely local reconstruction. Our
local reconstruction model is based on the recent advances of low-rank matrix
completion theory, where only a very small random portion of distance

incomplete distance data using solutions of special designed PDEs such as the

of manifold reconstruction from an incomplete distance by stitching patches
using the spectrum of the LB operator. Intensive numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

reconnection, which show a hierarchical chain of fast-moving plasmoids. The
reconnection occurs in a compact region (comparable to the black hole radius),
and the chain experiences fast Compton cooling accompanied by electron-positron
pair creation. The distribution of plasmoid speeds is shaped by radiative
losses, and the self-regulated chain radiates its energy in hard X-rays. The
mechanism is illustrated by Monte-Carlo simulations of the transfer of seed
soft photons through the reconnection layer. The emerging radiation spectrum
has a cutoff near 100 keV similar to the hard-state spectra of X-ray binaries
and AGN. We discuss how the chain cooling differs from previous
phenomenological emission models, and suggest that it can explain the hard
X-ray activity of accreting black holes from first principles. Particles
accelerated at the X-points of the chain produce an additional high-energy

model. The formal parameters are obtained without the linear approximation to
the shift function. The resultant $E$1 $S$-factor is not strongly enhanced by
the subthreshold 1$^-_1$ state if the channel radius is 4.75 fm. The calculated
$\beta$-delayed $\alpha$-particle spectrum of $^{16}$N and the $p$-wave phase
shift of $\alpha$+$^{12}$C elastic scattering are also found to be consistent

below the barrier. Owing to the large reduced width from the molecular

introduce temporal non-homogeneity into such models by making the transition
probabilities dependent on time-varying exogenous input variables via a

additional non-homogeneity into the emission distribution using a generalized

However, the presence of the logistic function in the state transition model
significantly complicates parameter inference for the overall model,
particularly in a Bayesian context. To address this we extend the
recently-proposed Polya-Gamma data augmentation approach to handle
non-homogeneous hidden Markov models (NHMMs), allowing the development of an
efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme. We apply our model
and inference scheme to 30 years of daily rainfall in India, leading to a

there is a long-distance part, perhaps as large as the planned experimental

computed using lattice methods by overcoming three technical difficulties: (i)

  topological approach using ev-degree and ve-degree Zagreb indices",,,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Topological indices have important role in theoretical chemistry for QSPR
researches. Among the all topological indices the Randi\'c and the Zagreb
indices have been used more considerably than any other topological indices in
chemical and mathematical literature. Most of the topological indices as in the
Randi\'c and the Zagreb indices are based on the degrees of the vertices of a
connected graph. Recently novel two degree concepts have been defined in graph
theory; ev-degrees and ve-degrees. In this study we define ev-degree Zagreb
index, ve-degree Zagreb indices and ve-degree Randi\'c index by using these new
graph invariants as parallel to their corresponding classical degree versions.
We compare these new group ev-degree and ve-degree indices with the other
well-known and most used topological indices in literature such as; Wiener,
Zagreb and Randi\'c indices by modelling some physicochemical properties of
octane isomers. We show that the ev-degree Zagreb index, the ve-degree Zagreb
and the ve-degree Randi\'c indices give better correlation than Wiener, Zagreb
and Randi\'c indices to predict the some specific physicochemical properties of
octanes. We investigate the relations between the second Zagreb index and
ev-degree and ve-degree Zagreb indices and some mathematical properties of
ev-degree and ve-degree Zagreb indices. Keywords:

Building on the recent work of Oblakova et al. (Exact expected delay and

Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack

transition metal (TM) adatoms (V-Fe) are explored by using ab initio methods

Cr, and Fe adatoms tend to locate on the top of the Mo atoms, while the most
stable site for the Mn atom is at the hollow position of the Mo-S hexagon.
After the Hubbard U is applied, the most stable sites of all the systems become
the top of the Mo atoms. Chern insulators without band inversion are achieved
in these systems. The V and Fe adsorption systems are the best candidates to
produce the topological states. The k.p model calculations indicate that these
topological states are determined by the TM magnetism, the C3v crystal field
from the MoS2 substrate, and the TM atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The
special two-meron pseudospin texture is found to contribute to the topology.
The apparent difference between the Berry curvatures for the V and Fe

theory which describes strictly gauge-invariant states in theories with a
Brout-Englert-Higgs effect. Such gauge-invariant states are composite operators
which have necessarily only global quantum numbers. As a consequence, flavor is
exchanged for custodial quantum numbers in the standard model, recreating the
fermion spectrum in the process. Here, we study the implications of such a
description, possibly also for the generation structure of the standard model.
In particular, this implies that scattering processes are essentially
bound-state-bound-state interactions, and require a suitable description. We
analyze the implications for the pair-production process $e^+e^-\to{\bar f}f$
at a linear collider to leading order. We show how ordinary perturbation theory
is recovered as the leading contribution. Developing a suitable PDF-type
language, we also assess the impact of sub-leading contributions. We find that
only for very heavy fermions in the final state, especially top quarks, sizable
corrections could emerge. This gives an interesting, possibly experimentally
testable, scenario for the formal field theory underlying the electroweak
sector of the standard model.

with finite memory are very common in wireless communications as well as in
wireline communications (e.g., in communications over power lines). To derive
the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian MIMO WTC with finite memory we first
construct an asymptotically-equivalent block-memoryless MIMO WTC, which is then
transformed into a set of parallel, independent, memoryless MIMO WTCs in the
frequency domain. The secrecy capacity of the Gaussian MIMO WTC with finite
memory is obtained as the secrecy capacity of the set of parallel independent
memoryless MIMO WTCs, and is expressed as a maximization over the input
covariance matrices in the frequency domain. Lastly, we detail two applications
of our result: First, we show that the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian scalar
WTC with finite memory can be achieved by waterfilling, and obtain a
closed-form expression for this secrecy capacity. Then, we use our result to
characterize the secrecy capacity of narrowband powerline channels, thereby
resolving one of the major open issues for this channel model.

activity using mean-covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machines, latent variable

was to figure out if binary latent states encode the regularities associated to
different visual stimuli, as modes in the joint distribution. We measured the
goodness of mcRBM encoding by calculating the Mutual Information between the
latent states and the stimuli shown to the retina. Results show that binary

gratings and natural scenes as stimuli. We also discovered that hidden

population receptive fields. We further investigated the ability of the model
to learn different modes in population activity by comparing results associated

constraining the search space of deterministic WA: k-delay and r-regret. A WA N
is k-delay determinizable if there exists a deterministic automaton D that
defines the same function as N and for all words {\alpha} in the language of N,
the accepting run of D on {\alpha} is always at most k-away from a maximal
accepting run of N on {\alpha}. That is, along all prefixes of the same length,
the absolute difference between the running sums of weights of the two runs is
at most k. A WA N is r-regret determinizable if for all words {\alpha} in its
language, its non-determinism can be resolved on the fly to construct a run of
N such that the absolute difference between its value and the value assigned to

determinizable for some k. Hence deciding the existence of some k is as
difficult as the general determinization problem. When k and r are given as

EXPtime-complete. We also show that determining whether a WA is r-regret

work, we use extensive computer simulations and an effective diffusion
approximation (in the weak selection limit) to determine under which
circumstances, depending on the individual-based update rules, the topology
drastically affects the long-time behavior of anti-coordination games. In
particular, we compute the variance of the number of cooperators in the
metastable state and the mean fixation time when the dynamics is implemented
according to the voter model (death-first/birth-second process) and the link
dynamics (birth/death or death/birth at random). For the voter update rule, we
show that the scale-free topology effectively renormalizes the population size
and as a result the statistics of observables depend on the network's degree
distribution. In contrast, such a renormalization does not occur with the link
dynamics update rule and we recover the same behavior as on complete graphs.

sections were investigated numerically for photon energies up to 50 MeV,
external field intensity parameter $\nu^2$ to value 2, and all scattering
angles. The variation of full cross sections with respect to external field
intensity was also established. The presence of the external field led to
resonances in the Compton scattering and pair production differential cross
sections. These resonances were investigated by calculating the electron self
energy in the presence of the external field. At resonance the differential
cross sections were enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The resonances
occurred for values of external field intensity parameter $\nu^2 <1$, lowering
the limit of $\nu^2 \sim 1$ at which point non linear effects in first order
external field QED processes become important. Generally, full cross sections
increased with increasing external field intensity, though peaking sharply for
Compton scattering and levelling off for pair production. An application was
made to non linear background studies at $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. The pair
production process and electron self energy were studied for the case of a
constant crossed electromagnetic field. It was found that previous analytic
expressions required the external field to be azimuthally symmetric. New

that strong coupling of the plasmon to the exciton is only present in the

complete and incomplete explosive Si burning, Ti44 is mainly produced by the
complete explosive Si burning, with a minor contribution (in standard non
rotating models) from the incomplete explosive Si burning and the O burning
(both explosive and hydrostatic). We find that, in most cases, the thickness of
the region exposed to the incomplete explosive Si burning increases in rotating
models (v_ini=300 km/s) and since Ni56 is significantly produced in this zone,
the fraction of mass coming from the complete explosive Si burning zone,
necessary to get the required amount of Ni56, reduces. Therefore the amount of
Ti44 ejected for a given fixed amount of Ni56 decreases in rotating models.
However, some rotating models at [Fe/H]=-1 develop a very extended O convective
shell in which a consistent amount of Ti44 is formed, preserved and ejected in
the interstellar medium. Hence a better modeling of the thermal instabilities
(convection) in the advanced burning phases together with a critical analysis
of the cross sections of the nuclear reactions operating in O burning are
relevant for the understanding of the synthesis of Ti44.

Wave (SW) evanescence coupled with Direct Current (DC) plasma biasing via
sheath boundary conditions in a 3D parallelepiped filled with homogeneous cold
magnetized plasma. Within a ""wide sheaths"" asymptotic regime, valid for
large-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF+DC model becomes
linear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be
re-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every
emitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual
contributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to
the sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal
distance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial
protrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the
emitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW
evanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field
lines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs
over a few centimeters. Typical parallel decay lengths for |VRF| are found
smaller than IC antenna parallel extension. Oscillating sheath voltages at IC
antenna side limiters are therefore mainly sensitive to E// emission by active
or passive conducting elements near these limiters, as suggested by recent
experimental observations. Parallel proximity effects could also explain why
sheath oscillations persist with antisymmetric strap toroidal phasing, despite
the parallel anti-symmetry of the radiated field map. They could finally
justify current attempts at reducing the RF fields induced near antenna boxes

characterized by a parameter $\epsilon$), in conjunction with standard two-pole
caustic (TPC) and outer gap (OG) emission geometries. The offset-PC dipole
$B$-field mimics deviations from the static dipole (which corresponds to
$\epsilon=0$). In addition to constant-emissivity geometric models, we also
considered a slot gap (SG) $E$-field associated with the offset-PC dipole
$B$-field and found that its inclusion leads to qualitatively different light
curves. Solving the particle transport equation shows that the particle energy
only becomes large enough to yield significant curvature radiation at large
altitudes above the stellar surface, given this relatively low $E$-field.
Therefore, particles do not always attain the radiation-reaction limit. Our
overall optimal light curve fit is for the retarded vacuum dipole field and OG
model, at an inclination angle $\alpha=78{_{-1}^{+1}}^{\circ}$ and observer
angle $\zeta=69{_{-1}^{+2}}^{\circ}$. For this $B$-field, the TPC model is
statistically disfavored compared to the OG model. For the static dipole field,
neither model is significantly preferred. We found that smaller values of
$\epsilon$ are favored for the offset-PC dipole field when assuming constant
emissivity, and larger $\epsilon$ values favored for variable emissivity, but
not significantly so. When multiplying the SG $E$-field by a factor of 100, we
found improved light curve fits, with $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ being closer to best
fits from independent studies, as well as curvature radiation reaction at lower
altitudes.

computation, communication and metrology. Optimal estimation allows one to
achieve the most precise parameter estimates, but requires accurate knowledge
of the model. Any inevitable uncertainty in the model parameters may heavily
degrade the quality of the estimate. It is therefore desired to make the
estimation process robust to such uncertainties. Robust estimation was
previously studied for a varying phase, where the goal was to estimate the
phase at some time in the past, using the measurement results from both before
and after that time within a fixed time interval up to current time. Here, we
consider a robust guaranteed-cost filter yielding robust estimates of a varying
phase in real time, where the current phase is estimated using only past
measurements. Our filter minimizes the largest (worst-case) variance in the
allowable range of the uncertain model parameter(s) and this determines its
guaranteed cost. It outperforms in the worst case the optimal Kalman filter
designed for the model with no uncertainty, that corresponds to the center of
the possible range of the uncertain parameter(s). Moreover, unlike the Kalman
filter, our filter in the worst case always performs better than the best
achievable variance for heterodyne measurements, that we consider as the
tolerable threshold for our system. Furthermore, we consider effective quantum
efficiency and effective noise power, and show that our filter provides the
best results by these measures in the worst case.

this subspace even full controllability can be achieved, although the
controllability over the system before the projection is very poor since the
control Hamiltonians commute with each other. We can also think of the
opposite: any Hamiltonians of a quantum system, which are in general
noncommutative with each other, can be made commutative by embedding them in an
extended Hilbert space, and thus the dynamics in the extended space becomes
trivial and simple. This idea of making noncommutative Hamiltonians commutative
is called ""Hamiltonian purification."" The original noncommutative Hamiltonians
are recovered by projecting the system back onto the original Hilbert space
through frequent measurements. Here we generalize this idea to open-system
dynamics by presenting a simple construction to make Lindbladians, as well as
Hamiltonians, commutative on a larger space with an auxiliary system. We show
that the original dynamics can be recovered through frequently measuring the
auxiliary system in a non-selective way. Moreover, we provide a universal pair
of Lindbladians which describes an ""accessible"" open quantum system for generic
system sizes. This allows us to conclude that through a series of frequent
non-selective measurements a nonaccessible open quantum system generally
becomes accessible. This sheds further light on the role of measurement
backaction on the control of quantum systems.

deformation, asymptotic analysis is performed to obtain the velocity of a

limiting situations of surfactant transport: (i) small surface Peclet number,
and (ii) high surface Peclet number. Thermocapillary-induced Marangoni stress,
strength of which relative to viscous stress is represented by thermal
Marangoni number, has strong influence on the distribution of surfactant on the
droplet surface. Temperature field not only affects the axial velocity of the
droplet but also has significant effect on the cross-stream velocity of the
droplet in spite of the fact that the temperature gradient is aligned with the
Poiseuille flow direction. When the imposed temperature increases in the
direction of Poiseuille flow, the droplet migrates towards the flow centerline.
The magnitude of both axial and cross-stream velocity components increases with
the thermal Marangoni number. However, when the imposed temperature decreases
in the direction of Poiseuille flow, the magnitude of both axial and
cross-stream velocity components may increase or decrease with the thermal
Marangoni number. Most interestingly, the droplet moves either towards the flow
centerline or away from it. Present study shows a critical value of the thermal
Marangoni number beyond which the droplet moves away from the flow centerline
which is in sharp contrast to the motion of a surfactant-laden droplet in
isothermal flow for which droplet always moves towards the flow centerline.

performance of the ORP scheme is further analyzed when different random
precoder groups are utilized over multiple time slots to exploit precoding

response changes with a predictor. We are motivated by environmental
applications in which the predictor is the dose of an exposure and the response

associated with a given increase in risk relative to a baseline. Popular
methods either dichotomize the continuous response or focus on modeling changes
with the dose in the expectation of the outcome. Such choices may lead to
information loss and provide inaccurate inference on dose-response

changing with the dose. To balance flexibility and parsimony, we rely on a
mixture model for the density at the extreme doses, and express the conditional
density at each intermediate dose via a convex combination of these extremal
densities. This representation generalizes classical dose-response models for
quantitative outcomes, and provides a more parsimonious, but still powerful,
formulation compared to nonparametric methods, thereby improving
interpretability and efficiency in inference on risk functions. A Markov chain

their positions on the sky, magnitudes, and photometric redshifts. The
contamination and completeness of the cluster catalog are derived using mock
catalogs based on the data themselves. The optimal signal to noise threshold
for the cluster detection is obtained by randomizing the galaxy positions and
selecting the value that produces a contamination of less than 20%. Starting
from a subset of clusters detected with high significance at low redshifts, we
shift them to higher redshifts to estimate the completeness as a function of
redshift: the average completeness is ~ 85%. An estimate of the mass of the
clusters is derived using the richness as a proxy. We obtained 1858 candidate
clusters with redshift 0 < z_c < 0.7 and mass 13.5 < log(M500/Msun) < 15 in an

  Vision and Pattern Recognition)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While invaluable for many computer vision applications, decomposing a natural
image into intrinsic reflectance and shading layers represents a challenging,
underdetermined inverse problem. As opposed to strict reliance on conventional
optimization or filtering solutions with strong prior assumptions, deep
learning based approaches have also been proposed to compute intrinsic image
decompositions when granted access to sufficient labeled training data. The
downside is that current data sources are quite limited, and broadly speaking
fall into one of two categories: either dense fully-labeled images in
synthetic/narrow settings, or weakly-labeled data from relatively diverse
natural scenes. In contrast to many previous learning-based approaches, which
are often tailored to the structure of a particular dataset (and may not work
well on others), we adopt core network structures that universally reflect
loose prior knowledge regarding the intrinsic image formation process and can
be largely shared across datasets. We then apply flexibly supervised loss
layers that are customized for each source of ground truth labels. The
resulting deep architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on all of the
major intrinsic image benchmarks, and runs considerably faster than most at
test time.

counterintuitive destabilizing effect on 2-phase planar jets. Here, the
transition process in confined 2D jets of two fluids with varying viscosity
ratio is investigated using DNS. Neutral curves for persistent oscillations are
found by recording the norm of the velocity residuals in DNS for over 1000
nondimensional time units, or until the signal has reached a constant level in
a logarithmic scale - either a converged steady state, or a ""statistically
steady"" oscillatory state. Oscillatory final states are found for all viscosity
ratios (0.1-10). For uniform viscosity (m=1), the first bifurcation is through
a surface tension-driven global instability. For low viscosity of the outer
fluid, there is a mode competition between a steady asymmetric Coanda-type
attachment mode and the surface tension-induced mode. At moderate surface
tension, the Coanda-type attachment dominates and eventually triggers
time-dependent convective bursts. At high surface tension, the surface
tension-dominated mode dominates. For high viscosity of the outer fluid,
persistent oscillations appear due to a strong convective instability. Finally,
the m=1 jet remains unstable far from the inlet when the shear profile is
nearly constant. Comparing this to a parallel Couette flow (without inflection
points), we show that in both flows, a hidden interfacial mode brought out by
surface tension becomes temporally and absolutely unstable in an intermediate
Weber and Reynolds regime. An energy analysis of the Couette setup shows that
surface tension, although dissipative, induces a velocity field near the
interface which extracts energy from the flow through a viscous mechanism. This
study highlights the rich dynamics of immiscible planar uniform-density jets,
where several self-sustained and convective mechanisms compete depending on the
exact parameters.

In comparison, relatively limited attention has been devoted to the interplay
between street structure and its functional usage, i.e., the movement patterns
of people and resources. To address this, we study the shape of 472,040
spatiotemporally optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated cities in the
world. The routes are sampled in a geographically unbiased way such that their
properties can be mapped on to each city, with their summary statistics
capturing mesoscale connectivity patterns representing the complete space of
possible movement in cities. The collective morphology of routes exhibits a
directional bias that could be described as influenced by the attractive (or
repulsive) forces resulting from congestion, accessibility and travel demand
that relate to various socioeconomic factors. To capture this feature, we
propose a simple metric, inness, that maps this force field. An analysis of the
morphological patterns of individual cities reveals structural and
socioeconomic commonalities among cities with similar inness patterns, in
particular that they cluster into groups that are correlated with their size
and putative stage of urban development as measured by a series of
socioeconomic and infrastructural indicators. Our results lend weight to the
insight that levels of urban socioeconomic development are intrinsically tied
to increasing physical connectivity and diversity of road hierarchies.

introduce two related properties, one weaker called the alternative Daugavet
property (if rank-one operators $T$ satisfy the requirements), and one stronger
called lushness, and we develop a complete theory about the relations between
these three properties. To do this, the concepts of spear vector and spear set
play an important role. Further, we provide with many examples among classical
spaces, being one of them the lushness of the Fourier transform on $L_1$. We
also study the relation of these properties with the Radon-Nikod\'ym property,
with Asplund spaces, with the duality, and we provide some stability results.
Further, we present some isometric and isomorphic consequences of these
properties as, for instance, that $\ell_1$ is contained in the dual of the
domain of every real operator with infinite rank and the alternative Daugavet
property, and that these three concepts behave badly with smoothness and
rotundity. Finally, we study Lipschitz spear operators (that is, those
Lipschitz operators satisfying the Lipschitz version of the equation above) and
prove that (linear) lush operators are Lipschitz spear operators.

glass beads through a hole that is small enough that the hopper is susceptible
to clogging. In particular, we measure the average and standard deviation of
the distribution of discharged masses as a function of both hole and grain
sizes. We do so in air, which is usual, but also with the system entirely
submerged under water. This damps the grain dynamics and could be expected to
dramatically affect the distribution of the flow events, which are described in
prior work as avalanche-like. Though the flow is slower and the events last
longer, we find that the average discharge mass is only slightly reduced for
submerged grains. Furthermore, we find that the shape of the distribution
remains exponential, implying that clogging is still a Poisson process even for
immersed grains. Per Thomas and Durian [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 178001 (2015]),
this allows interpretation of the average discharge mass in terms of the
fraction of flow microstates that precede, i.e. that effectively cause, a
stable clog to form. Since this fraction is barely altered by water, we
conclude that the crucial microscopic variables are the grain positions; grain
momenta play only a secondary role in destabilizing weak incipient arches.
These insights should aid on-going efforts to understand the susceptibility of
granular hoppers to clogging.

technique is proposed to design a state feedback controller ensuring for the
closed-loop system: i) the local exponential stability of the zero equilibrium
point; ii) the inclusion of a given region into the domain of exponential
stability of the equilibrium point; iii) the satisfaction of a guaranteed level
of performance, in terms of boundedness of some optimality indexes. In
particular, a sufficient condition for the existence of a state feedback
controller satisfying a prescribed integral-quadratic index is provided,
followed by a sufficient condition for the existence of a state feedback

time integration methods are used, where in every time step one or several
nonlinear systems of equations have to be linearized with the Newton-Raphson
method due to ferromagnetic materials involved. In this paper, a generalized
Schur-complement is applied to the magnetic vector potential formulation, which
converts a differential-algebraic equation system of index 1 into a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODE) with reduced stiffness. For the time
integration of this ODE system of equations, the explicit Euler method is
applied. The Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) stability criterion of explicit time
integration methods may result in small time steps. Applying a pseudo-inverse
of the discrete curl-curl operator in nonconducting regions of the problem is
required in every time step. For the computation of the pseudo-inverse, the
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is used. The cascaded Subspace
Extrapolation method (CSPE) is presented to produce suitable start vectors for
these PCG iterations. The resulting scheme is validated using the TEAM 10

the surface. The negative magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) might be a
possible mechanism for accomplishing this, but it has mainly been studied in
simple systems using an isothermal equation of state without a natural free
surface. We study NEMPI in a stratified Cartesian mean-field model where
turbulence effects are parameterized. We use an ideal equation of state and
include radiation transport, which establishes selfconsistently a free surface.
We use a Kramers-type opacity with adjustable exponents chosen such that the
deeper layers are approximately isentropic. No convection is therefore possible
in this model, allowing us to study NEMPI with radiation in isolation. We
restrict ourselves to two-dimensional models. We use artificially enhanced
mean-field coefficients to allow NEMPI to develop, making it therefore possible
to study the reason why it is much harder to excite in the presence of
radiation. NEMPI yields moderately strong magnetic flux concentrations a
certain distance beneath the surface where optical depth is unity. The
instability is oscillatory and in the form of upward travelling waves. This
seems to be a new effect that has not been found in earlier models without
radiative transport. The horizontal wavelength is about ten times smaller than
what has been found previously in more idealized isothermal models. In our
models, NEMPI saturates at field strengths too low to explain sunspots.
Furthermore, the structures appear too narrow and too far beneath the surface
to cause significant brightness variations at the radiative surface. We
speculate that the failure to reproduce effects resembling sunspots may be
related to the neglect of convection.

information-theoretically secure against an eavesdropper, who can access the
data transmitted to regenerate a total of $\ell$ different failed nodes. For
all known results on this problem, the achievable tradeoff regions between the
normalized storage capacity and repair bandwidth have a single corner point,
achieved by a scheme proposed by Shah, Rashmi and Kumar (the SRK point). Since
the achievable tradeoff regions of the exact-repair regenerating code problem
without any secrecy constraints are known to have multiple corner points in
general, these existing results suggest a phase-change-like behavior, i.e.,
enforcing a secrecy constraint ($\ell\geq 1$) immediately reduces the tradeoff
region to one with a single corner point. In this work, we first show that when
the secrecy parameter $\ell$ is sufficiently large, the SRK point is indeed the
only corner point of the tradeoff region. However, when $\ell$ is small, we
show that the tradeoff region can in fact have multiple corner points. In
particular, we establish a precise characterization of the tradeoff region for
the $(7,6,6,1)$ problem, which has exactly two corner points. Thus, a smooth
transition, instead of a phase-change-type of transition, should be expected as
the secrecy constraint is gradually strengthened.

of mm/submm phase fluctuation and phase correction methods obtained using ALMA
with baseline lengths up to ~15 km. Most of the spatial structure functions
(SSFs) show that the phase fluctuation increases as a function of baseline
length, with a power-law slope of ~0.6. In many cases, we find that the slope
becomes shallower (average of ~0.2-0.3) at baseline lengths longer than ~1 km,
namely showing a turn-over in SSF. The phase correction method using water
vapor radiometers (WVRs) works well, especially for the cases where PWV >1 mm,
which reduces the degree of phase fluctuations by a factor of two in many
cases. However, phase fluctuations still remain after the WVR phase correction,
suggesting the existence of other turbulent constituent that cause the phase
fluctuation. This is supported by occasional SSFs that do not exhibit any
turn-over; these are only seen when the PWV is low or after WVR phase
correction. This means that the phase fluctuation caused by this turbulent
constituent is inherently smaller than that caused by water vapor. Since there
is no turn-over in the SSF up to the maximum baseline length of ~15 km, this
turbulent constituent must have scale height of 10 km or more, and thus cannot
be water vapor, whose scale height is around 1 km. This large scale height
turbulent constituent is likely to be water ice or a dry component. Excess path
length fluctuation after the WVR phase correction at a baseline length of 10 km
is large (>200 micron), which is significant for high frequency (>450 GHz or
<700 micron) observations. These results suggest the need for an additional
phase correction method, such as fast switching, in addition to the WVR phase
correction. We simulated the fast switching, and the result suggests that it
works well, with shorter cycle times linearly improving the coherence.

increasing strain as dislocation tangles and dislocation cell structures
formed. No change in the orientation relationship was found at cube-on-cube
interfaces and these exhibited a lesser amount of plastic strain recovery in

  This paper deconstructs the ""tail at scale"" effect across TCP-IP, UDP-IP, and

caused by extrinsic network parameters like network congestion and flow
fairness. Contrary to existing literature, we identify surprising rare tails in
TCP-IP round-trip measurements that are as enormous as 110x higher than the
median latency. Our experimental design eliminates network congestion as a
tail-inducing factor. Moreover, we observe similar extreme tails in UDP-IP
packet exchanges, ruling out additional TCP-IP protocol operations as the root
cause of tail latency. However, we are unable to reproduce similar tail
latencies in RDMA packet exchanges, which leads us to conclude that the TCP/UDP
protocol stack within the operating system kernel is likely the primary source
of extreme latency tails.

residual LSTM is introduced. A plain LSTM has an internal memory cell that can
learn long term dependencies of sequential data. It also provides a temporal
shortcut path to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients in the temporal domain.
The residual LSTM provides an additional spatial shortcut path from lower
layers for efficient training of deep networks with multiple LSTM layers.
Compared with the previous work, highway LSTM, residual LSTM separates a
spatial shortcut path with temporal one by using output layers, which can help
to avoid a conflict between spatial and temporal-domain gradient flows.
Furthermore, residual LSTM reuses the output projection matrix and the output
gate of LSTM to control the spatial information flow instead of additional gate
networks, which effectively reduces more than 10% of network parameters. An
experiment for distant speech recognition on the AMI SDM corpus shows that
10-layer plain and highway LSTM networks presented 13.7% and 6.2% increase in
WER over 3-layer aselines, respectively. On the contrary, 10-layer residual

electron-ion systems from first principles. It combines the variational quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) solution of the electronic part with the path integral (PI)
formalism for the quantum nuclear dynamics. On the one hand, the PI molecular
dynamics includes nuclear quantum effects by adding a set of fictitious
classical particles (beads) aimed at reproducing nuclear quantum fluctuations
via a harmonic kinetic term. On the other hand, variational QMC can provide
Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces with a precision comparable to
the most advanced post Hartree-Fock approaches, and with a favorable scaling
with the system size. To deal with the intrinsic QMC noise, we generalize the
PI molecular dynamics using a Langevin thermostat correlated according to the
covariance matrix of QMC nuclear forces. The variational parameters of the QMC
wave function are evolved during the nuclear dynamics, such that the BO
potential energy surface is unbiased. Statistical errors on the wave function
parameters are reduced by resorting to bead grouping average, which we show to
be accurate and well controlled. Our general algorithm relies on a Trotter
breakup between the dynamics driven by ionic forces and the one set by the
harmonic interbead couplings. The latter is exactly integrated even in presence
of the Langevin thermostat, thanks to the mapping onto an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process. This framework turns out to be very efficient also in the case of
deterministic ionic forces. The new implementation is validated on the Zundel
ion by direct comparison with standard PI Langevin dynamics calculations made
with a coupled cluster potential energy surface. Nuclear quantum effects are
confirmed to be dominant over thermal effects well beyond room temperature
giving the excess proton an increased mobility by quantum tunneling.

variation (TV) and related penalties to regularize problems involving
reconstruction from undersampled or incomplete data. Superiorization is a
recently proposed heuristic which provides an automatic procedure to
""superiorize"" an iterative reconstruction algorithm with respect to a chosen
objective function, such as TV. Under certain conditions, the superiorized
algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is as satisfactory as any found
by the original algorithm with respect to satisfying the constraints of the
problem; this solution is also expected to be superior with respect to the
chosen objective.
  Most work on superiorization has used reconstruction algorithms which assume
a linear measurement model, which in the case of CT corresponds to data
generated from a monoenergetic X-ray beam. Many CT systems generate X-rays from
a polyenergetic spectrum, however, in which the measured data represent an
integral of object attenuation over all energies in the spectrum. This
inconsistency with the linear model produces the well-known beam hardening
artifacts, which impair analysis of CT images.
  In this work we superiorize an iterative algorithm for reconstruction from
polyenergetic data, using both TV and an anisotropic TV (ATV) penalty. We apply
the superiorized algorithm in numerical phantom experiments modeling both
sparse-view and limited-angle scenarios. In our experiments, the superiorized
algorithm successfully finds solutions which are as constraints-compatible as
those found by the original algorithm, with significantly reduced TV and ATV
values. The superiorized algorithm thus produces images with greatly reduced
sparse-view and limited angle artifacts, which are also largely free of the
beam hardening artifacts that would be present if a superiorized version of a
monoenergetic algorithm were used.

drive the networks more vulnerable against perturbations based on in- and

experiment share a common systematic uncertainty in addition to their individ
ual statistical errors. This is important in extracting the maximum information
from a set of similar bu t different experiments (or the same experiment under
different conditions) an alysing similar but different datasets, as happens at
the LHC and other particle colliders. There are two techniques in use: using
the full matrix and using extra paramneters, and we show, for a completely
general fit, that for an addit ive uncertainty they are in principle equivalent
even though in practice the det ails differ. For a multiplicative error the
matrix fit is equivalent to the extra parameter fit if the factor is applied to
the data points but not if it is applied to the function: the former leads to
biassed estimates and the latter avoids them.

anti-linear symmetries exhibit a giant non-reciprocity at the so-called exact
phase where the eigenfrequencies of the isolated non-Hermitian set-up are real.
The effect occurs in a parameter domain near an exceptional point (EP)
degeneracy, where mode-orthogonality collapses. The theoretical predictions are
confirmed numerically in the microwave domain, where a non-reciprocal transport
above 90dB is demonstrated, and are further verified using lump-circuitry
modeling. The analysis allows us to speculate the universal nature of the
phenomenon for any wave system where EP and gyrotropy can co-exist.

merger trees. Association rule analysis tries to find associations between
different halos(in same as well as in snapshots) using the particle IDs of the
particles which the halos are made of. Associations are expressed in the form
of association rules. Merger trees are one of the several useful results one
can obtain from the output of association rule analysis. Other results
including halo substructure and halo splitting can also be extracted. Each type
of output to be extracted from the association rule analysis output correspond
to a pattern in association rules. Merger trees were formed and tested using
the above technique. Dark matter simulations were run using Gadget-2 for 128^3
particles. Halos were extracted from the simulation snapshots using Amiga Halo
Finder. Halo accretion history was plotted and compared against those formed
using AHF merger tree builder.

a filtering problem for a stopped diffusion process and we apply results from
the filtering literature to this problem. In this way we obtain an
SPDE-characterization for the filter density. Moreover, we characterize the
default intensity under incomplete information and we determine the price

asset analysis in our setup: we explain how the model can be applied to the
pricing of options on traded assets and we discuss dynamic hedging and model

form) of a rotation symmetric Boolean function of degree $d$ in $n \geq d$
variables and let $wt(f_n)$ denote the Hamming weight of this function. Let
$(1, a_2, \ldots, a_d)_n$ denote the function $f_n$ of degree $d$ in $n$
variables generated by the monomial $x_1x_{a_2} \cdots x_{a_d}.$ Such a
function $f_n$ is called {\em monomial rotation symmetric} (MRS). It was proved
in a $2012$ paper that for any MRS $f_n$ with $d=3,$ the sequence of weights
$\{w_k = wt(f_k):~k = 3, 4, \ldots\}$ satisfies a homogeneous linear recursion
with integer coefficients. In this paper it is proved that such recursions
exist for any rotation symmetric function $f_n;$ such a function is generated
by some sum of $t$ monomials of various degrees. The last section of the paper
gives a Mathematica program which explicitly computes the homogeneous linear
recursion for the weights, given any rotation symmetric $f_n.$ The reader who
is only interested in finding some recursions can use the program and not be
concerned with the details of the rather complicated proofs in this paper.

studied thus far, including physics, mathematics and economics, there are
allometric scaling laws relating the outputs/inputs and the sizes of scientific

stable over the years. We also find that the deviations of individual subfields
from the overall scaling laws are good indicators for ranking subfields
independently of their sizes.
