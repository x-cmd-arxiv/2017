formulation for end-to-end management of campaign workflow along a
predetermined path and generalize it to include alternative path to oversee and
manage detail-oriented relationship with partners and internal teams to achieve
the goals above mentioned. To meet clients' KPIs, we consider an objective
function that includes the punctuality indicators (the average waiting time and
completion times) but also the main punctuality indicators (the average delay
and the on time performance). Then we investigate their analytical
relationships in the advertising domain through experiments based on real data
from a Traffic Office. We show that the classic punctuality indicators are in
contradiction with the task of reducing waiting times. We propose new
indicators used for a synthesize analysis on projects or process changes for
the wider team that are more sustainable, but also more relevant for

bottleneck of a Traffic Office and that alternate paths cannot improve the

They spin down due to
magnetic dipole radiation and wind emission. If photon has a nonzero mass, the
spin down rate would be smaller than the zero mass case. We show that an upper
limit of the photon mass, i.e. $m_\gamma\lesssim h/Pc^2$, may be placed if a
pulsar with period $P$ is observed to spin down. Recently, a white dwarf (WD)

with pulses. The spin-down luminosity of the WD can comfortably power the
non-thermal radiation from the system. Applying our results to the WD pulsar
with $P=117~\rm{s}$, we obtain a stringent upper limit of the photon mass
between $m_\gamma<6.3\times10^{-50}~\rm{g}$ assuming a vacuum dipole spindown,
and $m_\gamma<9.6\times10^{-50}~\rm{g}$ assuming a spindown due to a fully

to an end in late 2003, and the second began in February 2009, and continues as
of November 2016. Since the egress of the current event has not yet been

Spectroscopic observations suggest the presence of a small inner disk, although
the spectral energy distribution shows no infrared excess. We explore the
possibility that the dimming events are caused by an orbiting body (e.g. a disk
warp or dust trap), enhanced disk winds, hydrodynamical fluctuations of the
inner disk, or a significant increase in the magnetic field flux at the surface
of the star. We also find a $\sim$0.32 day periodic photometric signal that
persists throughout the 2009 dimming which appears to not be due to ellipsoidal
variations from a close stellar companion. High precision photometric
observations of V1334 Tau during K2 campaign 13, combined with simultaneous

accelerate. Our objective is to design search algorithms that achieve good
competitive ratios for the time spent by the robot to complete its search

different directions, 2) speed with constant acceleration and/or variability
depending on whether a certain segment has already been searched, 3) speed
dependent on the incline of the terrain. We provide both upper and lower bounds

potential with asymmetric rigid constraints (the displacement domain of each
particle is finite), and a linear nearest-neighbor coupling. When the particle
approaches the constraint, it undergoes an impact (not necessarily elastic),
that satisfies Newton impact law. Nonlinearity of the system stems from the
impacts; their possible non-elasticity is the sole source of damping in the
system. We demonstrate that this vibro-impact model allows derivation of exact
analytic solutions for the asymmetric discrete breathers, both in conservative
and forced-damped settings. The asymmetry makes two types of breathers
possible: breathers that impact both or only one constraint. Transition between
these two types of the breathers corresponds to a grazing bifurcation. Special
character of the nonlinearity permits explicit derivation of a monodromy
matrix. Therefore, the stability of the obtained breather solutions can be
exactly studied in the framework of simple methods of linear algebra, and with

expect to see these patterns repeated for cities around the world. Observing

that it admits quantifiable analysis of the closed-loop performance of the

architecture allows for the proportion in which the sources provide power to
vary with time; thus overcoming limitations of our previous designs.
Additionally, the proposed control framework is suitable to both centralized
and decentralized implementations, i.e., the same control architecture can be
employed for voltage regulation irrespective of the availability of common
load-current (or power) measurement, without the need to modify controller
parameters. The performance becomes quantifiably better with better
communication of the demanded load to all the controllers at all the converters

is absent. Case studies comprising of battery, PV and generic sources are
presented and demonstrate the enhanced performance of prescribed optimal

irradiance and phase of a laser beam. The beam shape is thereby determined by
the respective application. An elegant way to control the irradiance and phase
at the same time is from double freeform surfaces. In this work the numerical
design of continuous double freeform surfaces from ray mapping methods for
collimated beam shaping with arbitrary irradiances is considered. These methods
consist of the calculation of a proper ray mapping between the source and the
target irradiance and the subsequent construction of the freeform surfaces. By
combining the law of refraction, the constant optical path length and the
surface continuity condition, a partial differential equation (PDE) for the ray
mapping is derived. It is shown that the PDE can be fulfilled in a small-angle
approximation by a mapping derived from optimal mass transport with a quadratic
cost function. To overcome the restriction to the paraxial regime we use this
mapping as an initial iterate for the simultaneous solution of the Jacobian
equation and the ray mapping PDE by an optimization. The presented approach
enables the efficient calculation of compact double freeform surfaces for
complex target irradiances. This is demonstrated by applying it to the design
of a single-lens and a two-lens system.

be responsible for slow CE convergence. We studied over one hundred different

relaxation in CE data are too severe to build a reliable CE model. Using this
heuristic, CE practitioners can determine a priori whether or not an alloy

on a convex decomposition of the state into 'useful' and 'useless' quantum
states. By 'useful', we mean a state whose distillable entanglement is
non-negative and equal to its coherent information (and thus given by a
single-letter, tractable formula). On the other hand, 'useless' states are
undistillable, i.e., their distillable entanglement is zero. We prove that in
both settings the distillable entanglement is convex on such decompositions.
Hence, an upper bound on the distillable entanglement is obtained from the
contributions of the useful states alone, being equal to the convex combination
of their coherent informations. Optimizing over all such decompositions of the
input state yields our upper bound. The useful and useless states are given by
degradable and antidegradable states in the one-way LOCC setting, and by
maximally correlated and PPT states in the two-way LOCC setting, respectively.
We also illustrate how our method can be extended to quantum channels.
  Interpreting our upper bound as a convex roof extension, we show that it
reduces to a particularly simple, non-convex optimization problem for the
classes of isotropic states and Werner states. In the one-way LOCC setting,
this non-convex optimization yields an upper bound on the quantum capacity of
the qubit depolarizing channel that is strictly tighter than previously known
bounds for large values of the depolarizing parameter. In the two-way LOCC
setting, the non-convex optimization achieves the PPT-relative entropy of
entanglement for both isotropic and Werner states.

that end, we develop a physics-based continuum model for strain localization in

confining pressures, lower dilatancy and loose initial conditions. Lower
pressures, higher loading rates and higher dilatancy favor a brittle response

explosions in the galaxy, resulting from thermonuclear runaway on the surface
of an accreting neutron star. The $^{30}$S($\alpha$,p) reaction plays a
critical role in burst models, yet insufficient experimental information is
available to calculate a reliable, precise rate for this reaction. Purpose: Our
measurement was conducted to search for states in $^{34}$Ar and determine their
quantum properties. In particular, natural-parity states with large
$\alpha$-decay partial widths should dominate the stellar reaction rate.
Method: We performed the first measurement of $^{30}$S+$\alpha$ resonant
elastic scattering up to a center-of-mass energy of 5.5 MeV using a radioactive
ion beam. The experiment utilized a thick gaseous active target system and
silicon detector array in inverse kinematics. Results: We obtained an
excitation function for $^{30}$S($\alpha$,$\alpha$) near $150^{\circ}$ in the
center-of-mass frame. The experimental data were analyzed with an $R$-Matrix
calculation, and we observed three new resonant patterns between 11.1 and 12.1
MeV, extracting their properties of resonance energy, widths, spin, and parity.
Conclusions: We calculated the resonant thermonuclear reaction rate of
$^{30}$S($\alpha$,p) based on all available experimental data of $^{34}$Ar and
found an upper limit about one order of magnitude larger than a rate determined
using a statistical model. The astrophysical impact of these two rates has been
investigated through one-zone postprocessing type I x-ray burst calculations.
We find that our new upper limit for the $^{30}$S($\alpha$,p)$^{33}$Cl rate
significantly affects the predicted nuclear energy generation rate during the
burst.

stocks to a pair of stocks. Our trading strategy with the executions of two
round-trip trades can be described by the trading rates of the paired stocks
and the ratio of their trading periods. By minimizing the potential cost
arising from cross-impacts, i.e., the price change of one stock due to the
trades of another stock, we can find out an optimal strategy for executing a
sequence of trades from different stocks. We further apply the model of the
strategy to a specific case, where we quantify the cross-impacts of traded
volumes and of time lag with empirical data for the computation of costs. We
thus picture the influence of cross-impacts on the trading strategy.

action units embarrasses the training of deep networks, which can learn
disentangled invariant features. However, a linear model with just several
parameters normally is not demanding in terms of training data. In this paper,
we propose an elegant linear model to untangle confounding factors in
challenging realistic multichannel signals such as 2D face videos. The simple
yet powerful model does not rely on huge training data and is natural for
recognizing facial actions without explicitly disentangling the identity. Base
on well-understood intuitive linear models such as Sparse Representation based
Classification (SRC), previous attempts require a prepossessing of explicit
decoupling which is practically inexact. Instead, we exploit the low-rank
property across frames to subtract the underlying neutral faces which are
modeled jointly with sparse representation on the action components with group
sparsity enforced. On the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset (CK+), our one-shot
automatic method on raw face videos performs as competitive as SRC applied on
manually prepared action components and performs even better than SRC in terms
of true positive rate. We apply the model to the even more challenging task of
facial action unit recognition, verified on the MPI Face Video Database
(MPI-VDB) achieving a decent performance. All the programs and data have been
made publicly available.

Lyman-alpha (DLA) system currently known, based on observations made with the

the determination of three element abundances: [C/H] = -3.43 +/- 0.06, [O/H] =
-3.05 +/- 0.05, and [Si/H] = -3.21 +/- 0.05, as well as an upper limit on the
abundance of iron: [Fe/H] < -2.81. This DLA is among the most carbon-poor
environment currently known with detectable metals. By comparing the abundance
pattern of this DLA to detailed models of metal-free nucleosynthesis, we find
that the chemistry of the gas is consistent with the yields of a 20.5 M_sun
metal-free star that ended its life as a core-collapse supernova; the
abundances we measure are inconsistent with the yields of pair-instability
supernovae. Such a tight constraint on the mass of the progenitor Population
III star is afforded by the well-determined C/O ratio, which we show depends
almost monotonically on the progenitor mass when the kinetic energy of the
supernova explosion is E_exp > 1.5x10^51 erg. We find that the DLA presented
here has just crossed the critical 'transition discriminant' threshold,
rendering the DLA gas now suitable for low mass star formation. We also discuss
the chemistry of this system in the context of recent models that suggest some
of the most metal-poor DLAs are the precursors of the 'first galaxies', and are
the antecedents of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.

be comparable to the local value, indicating that variations in the stellar

early-type galaxies. Finally, we show that inference on the dark halo structure

q=M2/M1<0.1. No quantitative limits have previously been set for CasA and the
Crab, while for SN1987A we merely updated existing limits in view of new
estimates of the dust content. The lack of stellar companions to these three
ccSNe implies a 90% confidence upper limit on the q>0.1 binary fraction at
death of fb<44%. In a passively evolving binary model (meaning no binary
interactions), with a flat mass ratio distribution and a Salpeter IMF, the
resulting 90% confidence upper limit on the initial binary fraction of F<63% is
in considerable tension with observed massive binary statistics. Allowing a
significant fraction fM~25% of stellar binaries to merge reduces the tension,
with F<63/(1-fM)~81%, but allowing for the significant fraction in higher order
systems (triples, etc.) reintroduces the tension. That CasA was not a stellar
binary at death also shows that a massive binary companion is not necessary for
producing a Type IIb SNe. Much larger surveys for binary companions to Galactic
SNe will become feasible with the release of the full Gaia proper motion and

per year. However, it is unclear whether they are true analogs of local ULIRGs
or whether the mode of their star formation is more similar to that in local
disk galaxies. We target these questions by using Herschel-PACS to examine the
conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM) in far-infrared luminous SMGs at
z~1-4. We present 70-160 micron photometry and spectroscopy of the [OIV]26
micron, [FeII]26 micron, [SIII]33 micron, [SiII]34 micron, [OIII]52 micron,
[NIII]57 micron, and [OI]63 micron fine-structure lines and the S(0) and S(1)
hydrogen rotational lines in 13 lensed SMGs identified by their brightness in
early Herschel data. Most of the 13 targets are not individually
spectroscopically detected and we instead focus on stacking these spectra with
observations of an additional 32 SMGs from the \herschel\ archive --
representing a complete compilation of PACS spectroscopy of SMGs. We detect
[OI]63 micron, [SiII]34 micron, and [NIII]57 micron at >3sigma in the stacked

far-IR continuum are $(0.36\pm0.12)\times10^{-3}$,
$(0.84\pm0.17)\times10^{-3}$, and $(0.27\pm0.10)\times10^{-3}$, respectively.
Using the [OIII]52/[NIII]57 emission line ratio we show that SMGs have average
gas-phase metallicities $\gtrsim Z_{\rm sun}$. By using PDR modelling and
combining the new spectral measurements with integrated far-infrared fluxes and
existing [CII]158 micron data we show that SMGs have average gas densities, n,
of $\sim10^{1-3}{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and FUV field strengths, $G_0\sim10^{2.2-4.5}$

between layers of itinerant ferromagnetic materials in heterostructures. The
coupling is mediated by charge carriers that strive to maximally delocalize
through the heterostructure to gain kinetic energy. In doing so, they force a
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling between the constituent layers. To
illustrate this, we focus on heterostructures composed of SrRuO$_3$ and
La$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_3$ (A=Ca/Sr). Our mechanism is consistent with
antiferromagnetic alignment that is known to occur in multilayers of
SrRuO$_3$-La$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_3$. To support our assertion, we present a
minimal Kondo-lattice model which reproduces the known magnetization properties
of such multilayers. In addition, we discuss a quantum well model for
heterostructures and argue that the spin-dependent density of states determines
the nature of the coupling. As a smoking gun signature, we propose that
bilayers with the same constituents will oscillate between ferromagnetic and

we show that proto-magnetars with P around 1-5 ms produce heavy element
abundance distributions that extend to higher nuclear mass number than from
otherwise equivalent spherical winds (with the mass fractions of some elements
enhanced by factors of 100-1000). The heaviest elements are synthesized by
outflows emerging along flux tubes which graze the closed zone and pass near
the equatorial plane outside the light cylinder. Due to dependence of the
nucleosynthesis pattern on the magnetic field strength and rotation rate of the
proto-neutron star, natural variations in these quantities between core
collapse events could contribute to the observed diversity of the abundances of
weak r-process nuclei in metal-poor stars. Further diversity, including
possibly even a successful third-peak r-process, could be achieved for
misaligned rotators with non-zero magnetic inclination with respect to the
rotation axis. If proto-magnetars are central engines for GRBs, their
relativistic jets should contain a high mass fraction of heavy nuclei of

are uncommon in nature and, thus, Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ provides an experimental
playground for the study of broken $Z_n$ symmetry, for $n>2$. A recent
theoretical work examined the effect of a magnetic field on a pyrochlore

study predicted multiple domain transitions depending on the crystallographic
orientation of the magnetic field, inducing rich and controllable
magnetothermodynamic behavior. In this work, we present neutron scattering
measurements on Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ with a magnetic field applied along the [001]

exotic domain transitions. In a [001] field, we observe a $\psi_2$ to $\psi_3$
transition at a critical field of 0.18$\pm$0.05T. We are thus able to extend
the concept of the spin-flop transition, which has long been observed in Ising
systems, to higher discrete $Z_n$ symmetries. In a [111] field, we observe a
series of domain-based phase transitions for fields of 0.15$\pm$0.03T and
0.40$\pm$0.03T. We show that these field-induced transitions are consistent
with the emergence of two-fold, three-fold and possibly six-fold Zeeman terms.
Considering all the possible $\psi_2$ and $\psi_3$ domains, these Zeeman terms
can be mapped onto an analog clock - exemplifying a literal clock anisotropy.
Lastly, our quantitative analysis of the [001] domain transition in

diagnostics of today's plasmas might not be applicable to tomorrow's reactors,
but the present discussion suggests that reactors could largely rely on
microwave diagnostics, including techniques based on mode conversions and
Collective Thomson Scattering.

dwarf nova SSS J122221.7-311525 during its unusual double superoutburst, the
following decline and in quiescence. The second segment of the superoutburst
had a long duration of 33 d and a very gentle decline with a rate of 0.02
mag/d, and it displayed an extended post-outburst decline lasting at least 500
d. Simultaneously with the start of the rapid fading from the superoutburst
plateau, the system showed the appearance of a strong near-infrared excess
resulting in very red colours, which reached extreme values (B-I~1.4) about 20
d later. The colours then became bluer again, but it took at least 250 d to
acquire a stable level. Superhumps were clearly visible in the light curve from
our very first time-resolved observations until at least 420 d after the rapid
fading from the superoutburst. The spectroscopic and photometric data revealed
an orbital period of 109.80 min and a fractional superhump period excess <0.8
per cent, indicating a very low mass ratio q<0.045. With such a small mass
ratio the donor mass should be below the hydrogen-burning minimum mass limit.
The observed infrared flux in quiescence is indeed much lower than is expected
from a cataclysmic variable with a near-main-sequence donor star. This strongly
suggests a brown-dwarf-like nature for the donor and that SSS J122221.7-311525
has already evolved away from the period minimum towards longer periods, with
the donor now extremely dim.

channels from measured data. In this work, we introduce compressed
sensing-based methods that facilitate the reconstruction of quantum channels of
low Kraus rank. Our main contribution is the analysis of a natural measurement
model for this task: We assume that data is obtained by sending pure states
into the channel and measuring expectation values on the output. Neither
ancillary systems nor coherent operations across multiple channel uses are
required. Most previous results on compressed process reconstruction reduce the
problem to quantum state tomography on the channel's Choi matrix. While this
ansatz yields recovery guarantees from an essentially minimal number of
measurements, physical implementations of such schemes would typically involve
ancillary systems. A priori, it is unclear whether a measurement model tailored
directly to quantum process tomography might require more measurements. We
establish that this is not the case. Technically, we prove recovery guarantees
for three different reconstruction algorithms. The reconstructions are based on
a trace, diamond, and $\ell_2$-norm minimization, respectively. Our recovery
guarantees are uniform in the sense that with one random choice of measurement
settings all quantum channels can be recovered equally well. Moreover,
stability against arbitrary measurement noise and robustness against violations
of the low-rank assumption is guaranteed. Numerical studies demonstrate the
feasibility of the approach.

does there exist a tour of all $N$ cities stopping at each city exactly once
using the given roads (a Hamiltonian cycle)? This Hamiltonian cycle problem
(HCP) is an NP-complete problem, for which there is no known polynomial time
solution algorithm. The HCP has important practical applications, for example,
to logistical problems. It was claimed that an adiabatic quantum computer could
solve an NP-complete problem faster than classical algorithms, but claim
appears to have been debunked. Here we demonstrate an algorithm which runs on a
standard computer that efficiently and effectively solves the HCP for at least
up to 500 cities: We first optimized a simulated annealing based algorithm used
for smaller sized HCP problems. Then we found that when a tour was deliberately
inserted in a list of otherwise randomly chosen roads, crucially, if ""extra""
random roads are added to bring the total number of roads up to $0.58 N log_e
N$ or more there is a 100% chance our algorithm will find a HC, but conversely
when a list of roads does not include a pre-inserted tour random roads have to
be added until there are $0.9 N log_e N$ roads to have a chance of finding a
HC. We found similarly for a set of roads non-randomly chosen. Thus, the
presence of a HC in a set of roads induces ""connectivity"" throughout the roads
and a HC can be found with an insertion of a modest number of extra roads. Our
algorithm also shows that only weakly non-local information is needed to find
an HCP that is a global state.

is an important graph parameter from a practical point of view. Unfortunately,
many existing non-spatial models of complex networks do not generate graphs

contrast these results with the ones for the spatial preferential attachment

increases if the vertex gains an in-link, and otherwise decreases with time.

calculate gas-dynamic ows. The motion of the companion on the orbit leads to
the inhomogeneous distribution of the matter in the disk: there are a cleared
gap, density waves and streams of matter. Because of the disturbances the inner
part of the disk is tilted to its periphery and also do not coincides with the

by the star and, as a consequence, to the appearance of large-scale
inhomogeneity on the disk image: it has a bright area in the form of a

of nodes. The asymmetry of the disk image is clearly visible even if it is

visible, total intensity light with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), using the newly commissioned BAR5
occulter. These HST/STIS observations achieved an inner working angle
$\sim$0.2\arcsec, or 11.7~AU, probing the system at angular radii coincident
with recent images of the disk obtained by ALMA and in polarized intensity
near-infrared light. By comparing our new STIS images to those taken with STIS
in 2000 and with NICMOS in 1998, 2004, and 2005, we demonstrate that TW Hya's
azimuthal surface brightness asymmetry moves coherently in position angle.
Between 50~AU and 141~AU we measure a constant angular velocity in the
azimuthal brightness asymmetry of 22.7$^\circ$~yr$^{-1}$ in a counter-clockwise
direction, equivalent to a period of 15.9~yr assuming circular motion. Both the
(short) inferred period and lack of radial dependence of the moving shadow
pattern are inconsistent with Keplerian rotation at these disk radii. We
hypothesize that the asymmetry arises from the fact that the disk interior to
1~AU is inclined and precessing due to a planetary companion, thus partially
shadowing the outer disk. Further monitoring of this and other shadows on
protoplanetary disks potentially opens a new avenue for indirectly observing
the sites of planet formation.

framework based on a deep convolutional neural network, SOMAnet, that
additionally models other discriminative aspects, namely, structural attributes
of the human figure (e.g. height, obesity, gender). Our method is unique in
many respects. First, SOMAnet is based on the Inception architecture, departing
from the usual siamese framework. This spares expensive data preparation
(pairing images across cameras) and allows the understanding of what the
network learned. Second, and most notably, the training data consists of a
synthetic 100K instance dataset, SOMAset, created by photorealistic human body
generation software. Synthetic data represents a good compromise between
realistic imagery, usually not required in re-identification since surveillance
cameras capture low-resolution silhouettes, and complete control of the
samples, which is useful in order to customize the data w.r.t. the surveillance
scenario at-hand, e.g. ethnicity. SOMAnet, trained on SOMAset and fine-tuned on
recent re-identification benchmarks, outperforms all competitors, matching
subjects even with different apparel. The combination of synthetic data with
Inception architectures opens up new research avenues in re-identification.

ability to sample classically from the probability distribution induced by time
evolution under this Hamiltonian would imply unlikely complexity theoretic

efficiently simulated with a classical computer. Physical Ising spin systems
capable of achieving problem-size instances (i.e. qubit numbers) large enough
so that classical sampling of the output distribution is classically difficult

administrative, economic, and political purposes. Defining urban boundaries
that consider socio-economic relationships and citizen commute patterns is
important for many aspects of urban and regional planning. In this paper, we
describe a method to delineate urban boundaries based upon human interactions
with physical space inferred from social media. Specifically, we depicted the
urban boundaries of Great Britain using a mobility network of Twitter user
spatial interactions, which was inferred from over 69 million geo-located
tweets. We define the non-administrative anthropographic boundaries in a
hierarchical fashion based on different physical movement ranges of users
derived from the collective mobility patterns of Twitter users in Great
Britain. The results of strongly connected urban regions in the form of
communities in the network space yield geographically cohesive, non-overlapping
urban areas, which provide a clear delineation of the non-administrative
anthropographic urban boundaries of Great Britain. The method was applied to
both national (Great Britain) and municipal scales (the London metropolis).
While our results corresponded well with the administrative boundaries, many
unexpected and interesting boundaries were identified. Importantly, as the
depicted urban boundaries exhibited a strong instance of spatial proximity, we
employed a gravity model to understand the distance decay effects in shaping
the delineated urban boundaries. The model explains how geographical distances
found in the mobility patterns affect the interaction intensity among different
non-administrative anthropographic urban areas, which provides new insights
into human spatial interactions with urban space.

Nevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too
complicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to
capture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this
problem, this paper describes a set of test structures that can be used to
study the timing performance (i.e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various
interconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to
estimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art
interconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be
easily embedded on die as a parasitic variation monitor. We have validated the
proposed structure on a test chip in TSMC 28nm HPM process. Recently, the test
structure is further modified to identify the serious interconnect process
issues for critical path design using TSMC 7nm FF process.

mechanism in dealing with uncertainties for network systems. The study of
maximum capability of feedback control was pioneered in Xie and Guo (2000) for
scalar systems with nonparametric nonlinear uncertainty. In a network setting,
nodes with unknown and nonlinear dynamics are interconnected through a directed
interaction graph. Nodes can design feedback controls based on all available
information, where the objective is to stabilize the network state. Using
information structure and decision pattern as criteria, we specify three
categories of network feedback laws, namely the
global-knowledge/global-decision, network-flow/local-decision, and
local-flow/local-decision feedback. We establish a series of network capacity
characterizations for these three fundamental types of network control laws.
First of all, we prove that for global-knowledge/global-decision and
network-flow/local-decision control where nodes know the information flow
across the entire network, there exists a critical number
$\big(3/2+\sqrt{2}\big)/\|A_{\mathrm{G}}\|_\infty$, where $3/2+\sqrt{2}$ is as
known as the Xie-Guo constant and $A_{\mathrm{G}}$ is the network adjacency
matrix, defining exactly how much uncertainty in the node dynamics can be
overcome by feedback. Interestingly enough, the same feedback capacity can be
achieved under max-consensus enhanced local flows where nodes only observe
information flows from neighbors as well as extreme (max and min) states in the
network. Next, for local-flow/local-decision control, we prove that there
exists a structure-determined value being a lower bound of the network feedback
capacity. These results reveal the important connection between network
structure and fundamental capabilities of in-network feedback control.

combined with our long term radio monitoring seem to indicate that episodes of

been observed in radio loud quasars. Episodes of strong jet production also

metric within the context of conformal gravity (CG), and studied its effect on
the rotation curves of galaxies. He showed that for a Higgs field of the form

Higgs-frame Mannheim-Kazanas metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = \Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$,

employed in the fitting of the galactic rotation curves without the need to

the Mannheim-Kazanas metric in a gauge where it lacks the linear term has
already been presented by others, including Mannheim and Kazanas themselves,

Horne argues that the absence of the linear term resolves the issue of light
bending in the wrong direction, i.e. away from the gravitating mass, if $\gamma
r > 0$ in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, a condition necessary to resolve the
galactic dynamics in the absence of dark matter. In this case we also point out
that the elimination of the linear term is not even required because the sign
of the $\gamma r$ term in the metric can be easily reversed by a simple gauge
transformation, and also that the effects of this term are indeed too small to
be observed.

direct and inverse spin Hall effects near the ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic

phenomenon is known as the spin Hall magnetoresistance effect, whose magnitude
depends on the magnetization direction in the ferromagnet due to the spin
transfer effect. When another ferromagnet is placed onto the same nonmagnet,
these currents are again converted to the spin current by the spin Hall effect
and excite the spin torque to this additional ferromagnet, resulting in the
excitation of the coupled motions of the magnetizations. The in-phase or
antiphase synchronization of the magnetization oscillations, depending on the
value of the Gilbert damping constant and the field-like torque strength, is
found in the transverse geometry by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert

the synchronization having a phase difference of a quarter of a period is also
found in the longitudinal geometry. The analytical theory clarifying the
relation among the current, frequency, and phase difference is also developed,

its symmetric counterpart in the case of the anomalous group-velocity

MI, as well as for the system with opposite GVD signs in the two cores.
Following the analytical consideration of the MI, numerical simulations are

insulator $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$CuN(CN)$_2$Cl ($\kappa$-Cl).The FET shows a
continuous metal$-$insulator transition (MIT) as electrostatic doping proceeds.
The phase transition appears to involve two-step crossovers, one in Hall

conductivity occurs around the conductance quantum $e^2/h$ , and hence is not
associated with ""bad metal"" behavior, which is in stark contrast to the MIT in
half-filled organic Mott insulators or that in doped inorganic Mott insulators.
Through in-depth scaling analysis of the conductivity, it is found that the

by a high-temperature Mott quantum critical crossover, which is theoretically
argued to be a ubiquitous feature of various types of Mott transitions. [This

systematic effect. The delay spectrum methodology for 21 cm power spectrum
measurements brought new attention to the critical impact of an antenna's
chromaticity on the viability of making this measurement. This methodology
established a straightforward relationship between time-domain response of an
instrument and the power spectrum modes accessible to a 21 cm EoR experiment.
We examine the performance of a prototype of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization
Array (HERA) array element that is currently observing in Karoo desert, South
Africa. We present a mathematical framework to derive the beam integrated
frequency response of a HERA prototype element in reception from the return
loss measurements between 100-200 MHz and determined the extent of additional
foreground contamination in the delay space. The measurement reveals excess
spectral structures in comparison to the simulation studies of the HERA
element. Combined with the HERA data analysis pipeline that incorporates
inverse covariance weighting in optimal quadratic estimation of power spectrum,
we find that in spite of its departure from the simulated response, HERA
prototype element satisfies the necessary criteria posed by the foreground
attenuation limits and potentially can measure the power spectrum at spatial
modes as low as $k_{\parallel} > 0.1h$~Mpc$^{-1}$. The work highlights a
straightforward method for directly measuring an instrument response and
assessing its impact on 21 cm EoR power spectrum measurements for future

techniques to reconstruct the unknown shapes of high-dimensional spaces from

persistent topological features that can be used for any supervised or
unsupervised learning task, including multi-way classification. Sparse
sampling, on the other hand, provides a highly efficient technique to
reconstruct signals in the spatial-temporal domain from just a few
carefully-chosen samples. Here, we present a new method, referred to as the
Sparse-TDA algorithm, that combines favorable aspects of the two techniques.
This combination is realized by selecting an optimal set of sparse pixel
samples from the persistent features generated by a vector-based TDA algorithm.
These sparse samples are selected from a low-rank matrix representation of
persistent features using QR pivoting. We show that the Sparse-TDA method
demonstrates promising performance on three benchmark problems related to human

machine learning of predicting bacterial ecological niche than media
independent models or pure genome based species trees. We considered three
machine learning techniques: support vector machine, non-negative matrix
factorization, and artificial neural networks. In all three machine-learning
approaches, the media-based metabolic models and flux balance analyses were
more effective at predicting bacterial niche than the genome or PRMT models.
Support Vector Machine trained on a minimal media base with Mannose, Proline

first go through a carefully designed beamforming network, which could separate
multiple CFOs in the spatial domain with sufficient number of receive antennas.

evolution of type frequencies in a countable population which evolves under
resampling (genetic drift), mutation, and selection. In the classic FV model
the fitness (strength) of types is given by a measurable function. In this
paper, we introduce and study the Fleming-Viot process in random environment
(FVRE), when by random environment we mean the fitness of types is a stochastic
process with c\`adl\`ag paths. We identify FVRE as the unique solution to a so
called quenched martingale problem and derive some of its properties via
martingale and duality methods. We develop the duality methods for general
time-inhomogeneous and quenched martingale problems. In fact, some important
aspects of the duality relations only appears for time-inhomogeneous (and
quenched) martingale problems. For example, we see that duals evolve backward
in time with respect to the main Markov process whose evolution is forward in
time. Using a family of function-valued dual processes for FVRE, we prove that,
as the number of individuals $N$ tends to $\infty$, the measure-valued Moran
process $\mu_N^{e_N}$ (with fitness process $e_N$) converges weakly in
Skorokhod topology of c\`adl\`ag functions to the FVRE process $\mu^e$ (with
fitness process $e$), if $e_N \rightarrow e$ a.s. in Skorokhod topology of
c\`adl\`ag functions. We also study the long-time behaviour of FVRE process
$(\mu_t^e)_{t\geq 0}$ joint with its fitness process $e=(e_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and
prove that the joint FV-environment process $(\mu_t^e,e_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is
ergodic under the assumption of weak ergodicity of $e$.

  topic quality in topic modeling",,,,,"cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models trained without stopword removal
often produce topics with high posterior probabilities on uninformative words,
obscuring the underlying corpus content. Even when canonical stopwords are
manually removed, uninformative words common in that corpus will still dominate
the most probable words in a topic. In this work, we first show how the
standard topic quality measures of coherence and pointwise mutual information
act counter-intuitively in the presence of common but irrelevant words, making
it difficult to even quantitatively identify situations in which topics may be
dominated by stopwords. We propose an additional topic quality metric that
targets the stopword problem, and show that it, unlike the standard measures,
correctly correlates with human judgements of quality. We also propose a
simple-to-implement strategy for generating topics that are evaluated to be of
much higher quality by both human assessment and our new metric. This approach,
a collection of informative priors easily introduced into most LDA-style
inference methods, automatically promotes terms with domain relevance and
demotes domain-specific stop words. We demonstrate this approach's
effectiveness in three very different domains: Department of Labor accident
reports, online health forum posts, and NIPS abstracts. Overall we find that
current practices thought to solve this problem do not do so adequately, and
that our proposal offers a substantial improvement for those interested in

3D local shape priors. We then formulate the problem to select

These priors are sufficient to represent the 3D shapes of the whole class of

able to reconstruct geometrically faithful models with the same class of
objects from raw point clouds. Our framework can be easily generalized to
reconstruct various categories of 3D objects that have more geometrically or
topologically complex structures. Comprehensive experiments exhibit the power
of our exemplar priors for gracefully solving several problems in 3D shape

Inductively coupled RF discharge is initiated in the background of argon gas in
the source region which later found to diffuse in the main experimental
chamber. A secondary DC glow discharge plasma is produced to introduce the dust
particles into the plasma. These micron sized poly-disperse dust particles get
charged in the plasma environment and transported by the ambipolar electric
field of the diffused plasma and found to confine in the potential well, where
the resultant electric field of the diffused plasma (ambipolar E--field) and
glass wall charging (sheath E--field) hold the micron sized particles against
the gravity. Multiple co--rotating (anti--clockwise) dust vortices are observed
in the dust cloud for a particular discharge condition. The transition from
multiple to single dust vortex is observed when input RF power is lowered.
Occurrence of these vortices are explained on the basis of the charge gradient
of dust particles which is orthogonal to the ion drag force. The charge
gradient is a consequence of the plasma inhomogeneity along the dust cloud
length. The detailed nature and the reason for multiple vortices are still
under investigation through further experiments, however, preliminary
qualitative understanding is discussed based on characteristic scale length of
dust vortex. There is a characteristic size of the vortex in the dusty plasma
so that multiple vortices is possible to form in the extended dusty plasma with
inhomogeneous plasma background. The experimental results on the vortex motion
of particles are compared with a theoretical model and found some agreement.

surrogate models of parameterized dynamical systems is proposed. The framework
entails the use of high-dimensional regression techniques (e.g., random
forests, LASSO) to map a large set of inexpensively computed `error indicators'
(i.e., features) produced by the surrogate model at a given time instance to a
prediction of the surrogate-model error in a quantity of interest (QoI). This
eliminates the need for the user to hand-select a small number of informative
features. The methodology requires a training set of parameter instances at
which the time-dependent surrogate-model error is computed by simulating both
the high-fidelity and surrogate models. Using these training data, the method
first determines regression-model locality (via classification or clustering),
and subsequently constructs a `local' regression model to predict the
time-instantaneous error within each identified region of feature space. We
consider two uses for the resulting error model: (1) as a correction to the
surrogate-model QoI prediction at each time instance, and (2) as a way to
statistically model arbitrary functions of the time-dependent surrogate-model
error (e.g., time-integrated errors). We apply the proposed framework to model
errors in reduced-order models of nonlinear oil--water subsurface flow
simulations. The reduced-order models used in this work entail application of
trajectory piecewise linearization with proper orthogonal decomposition. When
the first use of the method is considered, numerical experiments demonstrate
consistent improvement in accuracy in the time-instantaneous QoI prediction
relative to the original surrogate model, across a large number of test cases.
When the second use is considered, results show that the proposed method
provides accurate statistical predictions of the time- and well-averaged
errors.

and several key features associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and
quark confinement. Calculations are performed in pure SU(3) gauge theory using
the chiral overlap fermion action. Starting from the original Monte Carlo gauge
fields, a vortex identification procedure yields vortex-removed and vortex-only
backgrounds. We examine the static quark potential, the quark mass function,
the hadron spectrum, the local topological charge density, and the distribution
of instanton-like objects on the original, vortex-removed and vortex-only
ensembles. The removal of vortices consistently results in the removal of the
corresponding feature associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.
Remarkably, we observe that after some smoothing, in each of these cases, the
vortex-only degrees of freedom are able to encapsulate the pertinent features
of the original gauge fields.

that are based on an atmosphere scattering model. Any error in atmosphere light
value will produce a direct impact on the accuracy of scattering computation
and thus bring chromatic distortion to restored images. To address this
problem, this paper propose a method that relies on clustering statistics to
estimate atmosphere light value. It starts by selecting in the original image
some potential atmosphere light source points, which are grouped into point
clusters by means of clustering technique. From these clusters, a number of
clusters containing candidate atmosphere light source points are selected, the
points are then analyzed statistically, and the cluster containing the most
candidate points is used for estimating atmosphere light value. The mean
brightness vector of the candidate atmosphere light points in the chosen point
cluster is taken as the estimate of atmosphere light value, while their
geometric center in the image is accepted as the location of atmosphere light.
Experimental results suggest that this statistics clustering method produces
more accurate atmosphere brightness vectors and light source locations. This
accuracy translates to, from a subjective perspective, more natural defogging
effect on the one hand and to the improvement in various objective image
quality indicators on the other hand.

inter-cluster interaction is characterized as hyper-edges in a hyper-graph with

iteratively solving a convex optimization problem for bandwidth allocation with
reduced complexity and constructing a global spectrum allocation using
hyper-graph coloring. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed solution for a

critical issue in the development of systems for renewable energy applications.
In this regard, the investigation of organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules for
the implementation in solar cells, has become a subject of intense research in
the last years. The present work is a systematic study at the B3LYP level of
theory performed for a series of 50 OPV materials. Full geometry optimizations
revealed that those systems with a twisted geometry are the most energetically
stable. Nuclear independent Chemical shifts (NICS) values show a strong
aromatic character along the series, indicating a possible polymerization in
solid-state, via a {\pi}-{\pi} stacking, which may be relevant in the design of
a solar cell device. The absorption spectra in the series was also computed
using Time Dependent DFT at the same level of theory, indicating that all
spectra are red-shifted along the series. This is a promissory property that
may be directly implemented in a photovoltaic material, since it is possible to
absorb a larger range of visible light. The computed HOMO-LUMO gaps as a
measurement of the band gap in semiconductors, show a reasonable agreement with
those found in experiment, predicting candidate materials that may be directly
used in photovoltaic applications. Non-linear optical (NLO) properties were
also estimated with the aid of a PCBM molecule as a model of an acceptor, and a
final set of optimal systems was identified as potential candidates to be
implemented as photovoltaic materials. The methodological approach presented in
this work may aid in the in silico assisted-design of OPV materials.

fixed for constant lighting, but is controllable (referred to as dimming

analysis reveals that the largest rate region is achieved when the fixed

encoder and dimming control are separated which greatly simplifies the
complexity of the transceiver. A case study of an indoor VLC channel with the
proposed transceiver reveals that the achievable information rates are
sensitive to the placement of the LEDs and the PDs. An interesting observation
is that for a given placement of LEDs in a 5 m X 5 m X 3 m room, even with a
substantial displacement of the users from their optimum placement, reduction
in the achievable rates is not significant. This observation could therefore be
used to define ""coverage zones"" within a room where the reduction in the

1.Restricting the language using formal language theory we show that the

show that there is a regular language for which the L-REACH is NL-complete even

deterministic context-free language L for which L-DAGREACH is LogCFL-complete.
2.We use L-REACH as a lens to study structural complexity. In this direction we
show that there is a language A in TC0 for which A-DAGREACH is NP-complete.
Using this we show that P vs NP question is equivalent to P vs DAGREACH-1(P)

radio-quiet quasar with the most massive black hole known at z>6. The VLBA
observations have a synthesized beam size of 12.10 mas $\times$5.36 mas (FWHM),
and detected the radio continuum emission from this object with a peak surface
brightness of 64.6+/-9.0 micro-Jy/beam and a total flux density of 88+/-19
micro-Jy. The position of the radio peak is consistent with that from SDSS in
the optical and Chandra in the X-ray. The radio source is marginally resolved
by the VLBA observations. A 2-D Gaussian fit to the image constrains the source
size to $\rm (7.1+/-3.5) mas x (3.1+/-1.7) mas. This corresponds to a physical
scale of (40+/-20) pc x (18+/-10) pc. We estimate the intrinsic brightness
temperature of the VLBA source to be T_{B}=(1.6 +/- 1.2) x 10^{7} K. This is
significantly higher than the maximum value in normal star forming galaxies,
indicating an AGN origin for the radio continuum emission. However, it is also
significantly lower than the brightness temperatures found in highest redshift
radio-loud quasars. J0100+2802 provides a unique example to study the radio
activity in optically luminous and radio quiet active galactic nuclei in the

accurately measure the spectral index and address the dominant radiation

of jobs has to be assigned to a set of machines. The jobs have a processing
time depending on the machine and the goal is to minimize the makespan, that is
the maximum machine load. It is well known that this problem is NP-hard and
does not allow polynomial time approximation algorithms with approximation
guarantees smaller than $1.5$ unless P$=$NP. We consider the case that there
are only a constant number $K$ of machine types. Two machines have the same
type if all jobs have the same processing time for them. This variant of the
problem is strongly NP-hard already for $K=1$. We present an efficient
polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) for the problem, that is, for any
$\varepsilon > 0$ an assignment with makespan of length at most
$(1+\varepsilon)$ times the optimum can be found in polynomial time in the
input length and the exponent is independent of $1/\varepsilon$. In particular
we achieve a running time of $2^{\mathcal{O}(K\log(K)
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log^4 \frac{1}{\varepsilon})}+\mathrm{poly}(|I|)$, where
$|I|$ denotes the input length. Furthermore, we study three other problem

the minimum machine load has to be maximized; the case of scheduling on
unrelated parallel machines with a constant number of uniform types, where
machines of the same type behave like uniformly related machines; and the
multidimensional vector scheduling variant of the problem where both the

to the appropriate K3 moduli space, which we call the generalized functional
invariant. Then we show that if the threefold total space is a smooth

justify information-processing primitives, like non-signalling between distant
agents. Here we propose exploring the opposite direction: to take agents as the
basic building blocks through which we test a physical theory, and recover
operational notions of locality from signalling conditions. First we introduce
an operational model for the effective state spaces of individual agents, as
well as the range of their actions. We then formulate natural secrecy
conditions between agents and identify the aspects of locality relevant for
signalling. We discuss the possibility of taking commutation of transformations
as a primitive of physical theories, as well as applications to quantum theory
and generalized probability frameworks. This ""it from bit"" approach establishes
an operational connection between local action and local observations, and
gives a global interpretation to concepts like discarding a subsystem or
composing local functions.

morphing types on the layer level were addressed, we target at the central
problem of network morphism at a higher level, i.e., how a convolutional layer
can be morphed into an arbitrary module of a neural network. To simplify the
representation of a network, we abstract a module as a graph with blobs as
vertices and convolutional layers as edges, based on which the morphing process
is able to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing
operations are introduced to compose the graphs, based on which modules are
classified into two families, i.e., simple morphable modules and complex
modules. We present practical morphing solutions for both of these two
families, and prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single
convolutional layer. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the
state-of-the-art ResNet on benchmark datasets, and the effectiveness of the

stochastic geometry, we derive tight approximation of achievable downlink rate
that enables us to compare the performance between densifying small cells and
expanding BS antenna arrays. Interestingly, we find that adding small cells
into the network improves the achievable rate much faster than expanding
antenna arrays at the macro BS. However, when the small cell density exceeds a
critical threshold, the spacial densification will lose its benefits and
further impair the network capacity. To this end, we present the optimal small
cell density that maximizes the rate as practical deployment guidance. In
contrast, expanding macro BS antenna array can always benefit the capacity
until an upper bound caused by pilot contamination, and this bound also
surpasses the peak rate obtained from deployment of small cells. Furthermore,
we find that allocating part of antennas to distributed small cell BSs works
better than centralizing all antennas at the macro BS, and the optimal
allocation proportion is also given for practical configuration reference. In
summary, this work provides a further understanding on how to leverage small
cells and massive MIMO in future heterogeneous cellular networks deployment.

seen in the magnetoresistance and quantum oscillations. In the presence of

${\cal R}_f$ (${\cal R}_{\tau}$) are the ratios of the decay constants
(lifetimes) of $\Xi_{bc}^{0}$ and $\Lambda_b^{0}$. The branching ratio of
$\Xi_{cc}^{+}\to \Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520)K^{-}$ is related to that of
$\Lambda_c^+\to \Delta^{++} K^-$, and thereby a conjectured topology analysis
leads to the range for the branching ratio as: ${\cal BR}(\Xi_{cc}^+\to
\Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520) K^-)\in \left[0.36\%,1.80\%\right]$. The decay
$\Xi_{cc}^+\to \Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520) K^-$ would be reconstructed in the $
\Lambda_{c}^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ final state which is easy to access even at a
hadron collider. Based on the two facts that abundant heavy quarks can be
produced at a hadron collider like LHC, and the branching ratios of
$\Xi_{bc}^{0}\to pK^{-}$ and $\Xi_{cc}^{+}\to \Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520)K^{-}$ are
sizable, we urge our experimental colleagues to perform a search at LHCb. This
will presumably lead to the discovery of the $\Xi_{bc}$ and $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ ,
and precision measurements of the branching ratios in the future are helpful to
investigate their decay mechanism.

detailed analysis of two different methods used for the determination of the

mainly attributed to the thermal contact resistance between the sample and the
thermal baths which generate the temperature gradient. Due to the variation of
the thermal resistance, we found that the scaling of the LSSE voltage to the
heat flux through the sample rather than to the temperature difference across
the sample greatly reduces the uncertainty. The characteristics of a single
YIG/Pt LSSE device obtained with two different setups was $(1.143\pm0.007)\cdot
10^{-7}$ Vm/W and $(1.101\pm0.015)\cdot 10^{-7}$ Vm/W with the heat flux method

by a topological twist along $\Sigma$) leading to a supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory on $S^2\times\Sigma\times I$, (ii) a further reduction on $S^2$
resulting in a complex Chern--Simons theory defined on $\Sigma\times I$, with
the real part of the complex Chern-Simons level being zero, and the imaginary
part being proportional to the ratio of the radii of $S^2$ and $S^1$, and (iii)
a final reduction to the boundary modes of complex Chern--Simons theory with
the Nahm pole boundary condition at both ends of the interval $I$, which gives
rise to a complex Toda CFT on the Riemann surface $\Sigma$. As the reduction of
the 6d theory on $\Sigma$ would give rise to an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric
theory on $S^2\times I\times S^1$, our results imply a 4d-2d duality between
four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory with boundary and
two-dimensional complex Toda theory.

consists in finding a way to use the Divide and Conquer paradigm in order to
have processors acting on its own data and scheduled in a parallel fashion.
MapReduce is a programming model that follows this paradigm, and allows for the
definition of efficient solutions by both decomposing a problem into steps on
subsets of the input data and combining the results of each step to produce
final results. Albeit used for the implementation of a wide variety of
computational problems, MapReduce performance can be negatively affected
whenever the replication factor grows or the size of the input is larger than
the resources available at each processor. In this paper we show an alternative
approach to implement the Divide and Conquer paradigm, named dynamic pipeline.
The main features of dynamic pipelines are illustrated on a parallel
implementation of the well-known problem of counting triangles in a graph. This
problem is especially interesting either when the input graph does not fit in
memory or is dynamically generated. To evaluate the properties of pipeline, a
dynamic pipeline of processes and an ad-hoc version of MapReduce are
implemented in the language Go, exploiting its ability to deal with channels
and spawned processes. An empirical evaluation is conducted on graphs of
different topologies, sizes, and densities. Observed results suggest that
dynamic pipelines allows for an efficient implementation of the problem of
counting triangles in a graph, particularly, in dense and large graphs,
drastically reducing the execution time with respect to the MapReduce
implementation.

foundations for knowledge representation. Nevertheless, in this paper, we argue
that FOL has several critical issues for this purpose. Instead, we propose an
alternative called assertional logic, in which all syntactic objects are
categorized as set theoretic constructs including individuals, concepts and
operators, and all kinds of knowledge are formalized by equality assertions. We
first present a primitive form of assertional logic that uses minimal assumed
knowledge and constructs. Then, we show how to extend it by definitions, which
are special kinds of knowledge, i.e., assertions. We argue that assertional
logic, although simpler, is more expressive and extensible than FOL. As a case

(pseudo)rapidity density of charged particles, which is a measure of the mean
transverse energy per particle, is an important observable in high energy
heavy-ion collisions, which reveals about the mechanism of particle production
and the freeze-out criteria. Its collision energy and centrality dependence is
exactly like the chemical freeze-out temperature till top RHIC energy. The LHC
measurement at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV brings up new challenges to rule out
the mechanisms of gluon saturation or non-equilibrium phenomena being prevalent
at high energies, which could contribute to the above observable. The
Statistical Hadron Gas Model (SHGM) with a static fireball approximation has
been successful in describing both the centrality and energy dependence till
top RHIC energies. However, the SHGM predictions for higher energies are highly
underestimated by the LHC data. In order to understand this, we have
incorporated radial flow effect in an excluded volume SHGM. The hard-core
radius of baryons at lower collision energies plays an important role in the
description of a hadronic system. In view of this, in order to make a complete
energy dependence study from FAIR to LHC energies, we have considered an
excluded volume SHGM. Our studies suggest that the collective flow plays an
important role in describing $E_{T}/N_{ch}$ and it could be one of the possible
parameters to explain the jump observed in $E_{T}/N_{ch}$ from RHIC to LHC
energies. Predictions for the LHC measurements at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV

shear by using a mesoscopic elasto-plastic model. The model combines a full
(tensorial) description of the elastic interactions in the system, and the
possibility of structural reaccommodations that are responsible for the plastic
behavior. The possible structural reaccommodations are encoded in the form of a
""plastic disorder"" potential, which is chosen independently at each position of
the sample to account for local heterogeneities. We observe that the stress
must exceed a critical value $\sigma_c$ in order for the system to yield. In
addition, when the system yields a flow curve relating stress $\sigma$ and
strain rate $\dot\gamma$ of the form $\dot\gamma \sim(\sigma-\sigma_c)^\beta $
is obtained. Remarkably, we observe the value of $\beta$ to depend on some
details of the plastic disorder potential. For smooth potentials a value of
$\beta\simeq 2.0$ is obtained, whereas for potentials obtained as a
concatenation of smooth pieces a value $\beta\simeq 1.5$ is observed in the
simulations. This indicates a dependence of critical behavior on details of the
plastic behavior that has not been pointed out before. In addition, by
integrating out non-essential, harmonic degrees of freedom, we derive a
simplified scalar version of the model that represents a collection of
interacting Prandtl-Tomlinson particles. A mean field treatment of this
interaction reproduces the difference of $\beta$ exponents for the two classes
of plastic disorder potentials, and provides values of $\beta$ that compare
favorably with those found in the full simulations.

compatible with negligible operators and stable under vanishing frequency

Parenti--Rodino, type $1,1$-operators with unclosable graphs are proved to
exist; others are shown to lack the microlocal property as they flip the
wavefront set of an almost nowhere differentiable function. In contrast the
definition is shown to imply the pseudo-local property, so type 1,1-operators
cannot create singularities but only change their nature. The familiar rule
that the support of the argument is transported by the support of the
distribution kernel is generalised to arbitrary type $1,1$-operators. A similar
spectral support rule is also proved. As no restrictions appear for classical
type $1,0$-operators, this is a new result which in many cases makes it
unnecessary to reduce to elementary symbols. As an important tool, a convergent
sequence of distributions is said to converge regularly if it moreover
converges as smooth functions outside the singular support of the limit. This
notion is shown to allow limit processes in extended versions of the formula
relating operators and kernels.

well-mixed, diluted cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in
a microcolony interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to
which they are attached. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the role
of such mechanical interactions on growth and biological evolution of microbial
populations. Here we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped
cells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their
motion in the colony, this affects biological evolution. We show that the
probability that a faster-growing mutant ""surfs"" at the colony's frontier and
creates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape,
elasticity, friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing
probability in seemingly different ways, they all ultimately exhibit their
effects by altering the roughness of the expanding frontier of the colony and
the orientation of cells. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which
we measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness.
Our results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an
important role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these
interaction may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of
antibiotic resistance.

  Effects","11 pages,8 figures, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reactive power compensation is an important challenge in current and future
smart power systems. However, in the context of reactive power compensation,
most existing studies assume that customers can assess their compensation
value, i.e., Var unit, objectively. In this paper, customers are assumed to
make decisions that pertain to reactive power coordination. In consequence, the
way in which those customers evaluate the compensation value resulting from
their individual decisions will impact the overall grid performance. In
particular, a behavioral framework, based on the framing effect of prospect
theory (PT), is developed to study the effect of both objective value and
subjective evaluation in a reactive power compensation game. For example, such
effect allows customers to optimize a subjective value of their utility which
essentially frames the objective utility with respect to a reference point.
This game enables customers to coordinate the use of their electrical devices
to compensate reactive power. For the proposed game, both the objective case
using expected utility theory (EUT) and the PT consideration are solved via a
learning algorithm that converges to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In
addition, several key properties of this game are derived analytically.
Simulation results show that, under PT, customers are likely to make decisions
that differ from those predicted by classical models. For instance, using an
illustrative two-customer case, we show that a PT customer will increase the
conservative strategy (achieving a high power factor) by 29% compared to a
conventional customer. Similar insights are also observed for a case with three
customers.

game between the informed sector and the uninformed one. In a market with
risk-neutral agents, De Meyer [2010] proves that the price process should be a
particular kind of Brownian martingale called CMMV. This type of dynamics is
due to the strategic use of their private information by the informed agents.
In the current paper, we consider the more realistic case where agents on the
market are risk-averse. This case is much more complex to analyze as it leads
to a non-zero-sum game. Our main result is that the price process is still a
CMMV under a martingale equivalent measure. This paper provides thus a
theoretical justification for the use of the CMMV class of dynamics in
financial analysis. This class contains as a particular case the Black and

causal side information is available at the encoder in a causal manner. First,
we study the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) with input and state
constraints, when the encoder has state information in a causal manner. Lower
and upper bounds on the random code capacity are developed. A lower bound on
the deterministic code capacity is established in the case of a
message-averaged input constraint. In the setting where a state constraint is
imposed on the jammer, while the user is under no constraints, the random code
bounds coincide, and the random code capacity is determined. Furthermore, for
this scenario, a generalized non-symmetrizability condition is stated, under
which the deterministic code capacity coincides with the random code capacity.
  A second model considered in our work is the arbitrarily varying degraded
broadcast channel with causal side information at the encoder (without
constraints). We establish inner and outer bounds on both the random code
capacity region and the deterministic code capacity region. The capacity region
is then determined for a class of channels satisfying a condition on the mutual
informations between the strategy variables and the channel outputs. As an
example, we show that the condition holds for the arbitrarily varying binary
symmetric broadcast channel, and we find the corresponding capacity region.

disentangling the primordial non-Gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave Background

Aiming at detecting the NGs of the CMB temperature anisotropy $\delta T$, while
paying particular attention to a model-independent quantification of NGs, our
analysis is based upon statistical and morphological univariate descriptors,
respectively: the probability density function $P(\delta T)$, related to
${\mathrm v}_{0}$, the first Minkowski Functional (MF), and the two other MFs,
${\mathrm v}_{1}$ and ${\mathrm v}_{2}$. From their analytical Gaussian
predictions we build the discrepancy functions $\Delta_{k}$ ($k=P,0,1,2$) which
are applied to an ensemble of $10^{5}$ CMB realization maps of the $\Lambda$CDM
model and to the $Planck$ CMB maps. In our analysis we use general Hermite
expansions of the $\Delta_{k}$ up to the $12^{th}$ order, where the
coefficients are explicitly given in terms of cumulants. Assuming hierarchical
ordering of the cumulants, we obtain the perturbative expansions generalizing
the $2^{nd}$ order expansions of Matsubara to arbitrary order in the standard

perturbative expansion coefficients are explicitly given in terms of complete
Bell polynomials. The comparison of the Hermite expansions and the perturbative

the microstructural heterogeneity is taken into account by means of periodic
perturbation functions, which derive from the solution of non homogeneous
recursive cell problems defined over the unit periodic cell. A strong coupling
is present between the micro displacement field and the micro electric
potential field, since the mechanical and the electric problems are fully
coupled in the asymptotically expanded microscale field equations. The micro
displacement, the electric potential, and the relative temperature fields have
been related to the macroscopic quantities and to their gradients in the
derived down-scaling relations. Average field equations of infinite order have
been obtained and the closed form of the overall constitutive tensors has been
determined for the equivalent first-order homogenized continuum. A formal
solution of such equations has been derived by means of an asymptotic expansion
of the macro fields. The accuracy of the proposed formulation is assessed in
relation to illustrative examples of a bi-material periodic microstructure
subjected to harmonic body forces, free charge densities, and heat sources,
whose periodicity is much greater than the characteristic microstructural size.
The good agreement obtained between the solution of the homogenized model and
the finite element solution of the original heterogeneous material problem
confirms the validity of the proposed formulation.

is the exact chiral symmetry, but as a price for this the fermion doublers
become zeros of the Green function. In this case the contribution to the CSE of
zeros and poles of the Green function cancel each other.

explain the astronomical observations in the Universe without the inclusion of
particle dark matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics, in its current form, cannot
explain the missing mass in galaxy clusters without the inclusion of some extra
mass, be it in the form of neutrinos or non-luminous baryonic matter. We
investigate whether the MOND framework can be generalized to account for the
missing mass in galaxy clusters by boosting gravity in high gravitational
potential regions. We examine and review Extended MOND (EMOND), which was
designed to increase the MOND scale acceleration in high potential regions,
thereby boosting the gravity in clusters. We seek to investigate galaxy cluster
mass profiles in the context of MOND with the primary aim at explaining the
missing mass problem fully without the need for dark matter. Using the
assumption that the clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we can compute the
dynamical mass of each cluster and compare the result to the predicted mass of
the EMOND formalism. We find that EMOND has some success in fitting some
clusters, but overall has issues when trying to explain the mass deficit fully.
We also investigate an empirical relation to solve the cluster problem, which
is found by analysing the cluster data and is based on the MOND paradigm. We
discuss the limitations in the text.

arrival order at each node and after finishing their service they can re-enter
at nodes several times (as new customers) for new services. At the second
layer, active servers act as jobs which are served by a single server working
at speed one in a Processor-Sharing fashion. We further assume that the degree
of resource sharing is limited by choice, leading to a Limited
Processor-Sharing discipline. Our main result is a diffusion approximation for
the process describing the number of customers in the system. Assuming a single
bottleneck node and studying the system as it approaches heavy traffic, we
prove a state-space collapse property. The key to derive this property is to
study the model at the second layer and to prove a diffusion limit theorem,
which yields an explicit approximation for the customers in the system.

evolution as well as inflationary physics, measures the correlation of three
wavenumbers, in the configuration where one wavenumber is much smaller than the
other two. Since the squeezed-limit bispectrum encodes the impact of a
large-scale fluctuation on the small-scale power spectrum, it can be understood
as how the small-scale power spectrum ""responds"" to the large-scale
fluctuation. Viewed in this way, the squeezed-limit bispectrum can be
calculated using the response approach even in the cases which do not submit to
perturbative treatment. To illustrate this point, we apply this approach to the
cross-correlation between the large-scale quasar density field and small-scale
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum. In particular, using separate
universe simulations which implement changes in the large-scale density,
velocity gradient, and primordial power spectrum amplitude, we measure how the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum responds to the local,
long-wavelength quasar overdensity, and equivalently their squeezed-limit
bispectrum. We perform a Fisher forecast for the ability of future experiments
to constrain local non-Gaussianity using the bispectrum of quasars and the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Combining with quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power
spectra to constrain the biases, we find that for DESI the expected $1-\sigma$
constraint is ${\rm err}[f_{\rm NL}]\sim60$. Ability for DESI to measure
$f_{\rm NL}$ through this channel is limited primarily by the aliasing and
instrumental noise of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum. The
combination of response approach and separate universe simulations provides a
novel technique to explore the constraints from the squeezed-limit bispectrum
between different observables.

a positive secrecy rate at the destination. Then, we solve the original secrecy
rate maximization problem, which is not convex in terms of power allocation at
the jammers. To circumvent this non-convexity, the achievable secrecy rate is
approximated for a given power allocation at the jammers and the approximated
problem is formulated into a geometric programming one. Based on this
approximation, an iterative algorithm has been developed to obtain the optimal
power allocation at the jammers. Next, we provide a bisection approach, based
on one-dimensional search, to validate the optimality of the proposed
algorithm. In addition, by assuming Rayleigh fading, the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) of the proposed cooperative jamming scheme is analyzed. More
specifically, a single-integral form expression for SOP is derived for the most
general case as well as a closed-form expression for the special case of two
cooperative jammers and one eavesdropper. Simulation results have been provided

approach has been successfully applied to simulated observations that include
astrophysically realistic foregrounds in a companion publication (Sims et al.

foreground models to both demonstrate its efficacy, and highlight salient

received recent interest. Asynchronous algorithms are often studied to solve
optimization problems where the cost function takes the form $\sum_{i=1}^M
f_i(x)$, with a common assumption that each $f_i$ is sparse; that is, each
$f_i$ acts only on a small number of components of $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Sparse
recovery problems, such as compressed sensing, can be formulated as
optimization problems, however, the cost functions $f_i$ are dense with respect
to the components of $x$, and instead the signal $x$ is assumed to be sparse,
meaning that it has only $s$ non-zeros where $s\ll n$. Here we address how one
may use an asynchronous parallel architecture when the cost functions $f_i$ are
not sparse in $x$, but rather the signal $x$ is sparse. We propose an
asynchronous parallel approach to sparse recovery via a stochastic greedy
algorithm, where multiple processors asynchronously update a vector in shared
memory containing information on the estimated signal support. We include

the original, but now with two layers of paper. For the folding, only ""corner
folds"" and ""half edge cuts"" are allowed, unless the polyomino forms a closed
loop, in which case one is allowed to completely cut two squares in the
polyomino apart. With this set of allowable moves, the authors present
algorithms for folding different types of polyominoes and prove that certain
polyominoes can successfully be folded to two layers. The authors also
establish that other polyominoes cannot be folded to two layers if only these
moves are allowed.

various engineering fields, its application to air-conditioning systems is
limited due to the lack of control-oriented models to characterize the phase
change of refrigerant in the vapor compression cycle. The emergence of moving
boundary method (MBM) illuminates a promising way for FTC design. In this
paper, we exploit a control-oriented nonlinear model comparable to MBM to
design an FTC framework with a generalized internal model control (GIMC)
approach. A fault detector and isolator (FDI) is developed to identify
potential actuator and sensor faults. A fault compensator is employed to
compensate these faults if detected. Comprehensive simulations are carried out
to evaluate the developed FTC framework with promising results. Plant
variations are explicitly considered to enhance the gain-scheduled FTC

  Untrusted Relays",,,,,"cs.CR cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative relaying is often deployed to enhance the communication
reliability (i.e., diversity order) and consequently the end-to-end achievable
rate. However, this raises several security concerns when the relays are
untrusted since they may have access to the relayed message. In this paper, we
study the achievable secrecy diversity order of cooperative networks with
untrusted relays. In particular, we consider a network with an N-antenna
transmitter (Alice), K single-antenna relays, and a single-antenna destination
(Bob). We consider the general scenario where there is no relation between N
and K, and therefore K can be larger than N. Alice and Bob are assumed to be
far away from each other, and all communication is done through the relays,
i.e., there is no direct link. Providing secure communication while enhancing
the diversity order has been shown to be very challenging. In fact, it has been
shown in the literature that the maximum achievable secrecy diversity order for
the adopted system model is one (while using artificial noise jamming). In this
paper, we adopt a nonlinear interference alignment scheme that we have proposed
recently to transmit the signals from Alice to Bob. We analyze the proposed
scheme in terms of the achievable secrecy rate and secrecy diversity order.
Assuming Gaussian inputs, we derive an explicit expression for the achievable
secrecy rate and show analytically that a secrecy diversity order of up to
min(N,K)-1 can be achieved using the proposed technique. We provide several
numerical examples to validate the obtained analytical results and demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed technique to its counterparts that exist in the
literature.

factor for optical interference, since Wiener's experiments in 1890 proved that
the electric field plays such a dominant role. A group of experiments were
demonstrated against Wiener's experiments under the condition that the
interference fringes made by optical standing waves could have been
distinguished from the fringes of equal thickness between the inner surface of
emulsion and the plane mirror used to build the optical standing waves. It was
found that the Bragg diffraction from the interference fringes formed by the
standing waves did not exist. This means optical standing waves did not blacken
the photographic emulsion, or the electric field did not play such a dominant
role. Therefore, instead of the electric-field energy density solely in
proportion to the electric-field square, Energy Flux in Interference was
proposed to represent the intensity of optical interference-field and approved
in the derivation of equations for the interference. The derived equations
indicate that both the electric-field vector and the magnetic-field vector are
in phase and have equal amount of energy densities at the interference maxima
of two light beams. Thus, the magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the
electric-field vector on light interacting with substance. The fundamental
factor of optical interference is electromagnetic energy flux densities rather
than electric-field alone, or the intensity of optical interference fringes
should be the energy flux density, not electric-field energy density.

organic photovoltaic cells. The initial tightly bound excitonic electron-hole
pair has to dissociate fast enough in order to avoid photocurrent generation
and thus power conversion efficiency loss via geminate recombination. Such
process takes place assisted by transitional states that lie between the
initial exciton and the free charge state. Due to spin conservation rules these
intermediate charge transfer states typically have singlet character. Here we
propose a donor-acceptor model for a generic organic photovoltaic cell in which
the process of charge separation is modulated by a magnetic field which tunes
the energy levels. The impact of a magnetic field is to intensify the
generation of charge transfer states with triplet character via inter-system
crossing. As the ground state of the system has singlet character, triplet
states are recombination-protected, thus leading to a higher probability of
successful charge separation. Using the open quantum systems formalism we
demonstrate that not only the population of triplet charge transfer states
grows in the presence of a magnetic field, but also how the power outcome of an
organic photovoltaic cell is in that way increased.

six-vertex model, including closed expressions for the partition function for
any system size as well as its asymptotics and leading finite-size corrections.
To complement this picture we use a full lattice multi-cluster algorithm to
study equilibrium properties of this model for systems of moderate size, up to
L=512. We compare the energy to its exactly known large-L asymptotics. We
investigate the model's infinite-order phase transition by means of finite-size
scaling for an observable derived from the staggered polarization in order to
test the method put forward in our recent joint work with Duine and Barkema. In
addition we analyse local properties of the model. Our data are perfectly
consistent with analytical expressions for the arctic curves. We investigate
the structure inside the temperate region of the lattice, confirming the
oscillations in vertex densities that were first observed by Sylju{\aa}sen and
Zvonarev, and recently studied by Lyberg et al. We point out
'(anti)ferroelectric' oscillations close to the corresponding frozen regions as
well as 'higher-order' oscillations forming an intricate pattern with
saddle-point-like features.

colored edges. We assume two equal-sized communities and there are $m$
different types of edges. If two vertices are in the same community, the
distribution of edges follows $p_i=\alpha_i\log{n}/n$ for $1\leq i \leq m$,
otherwise the distribution of edges is $q_i=\beta_i\log{n}/n$ for $1\leq i \leq
m$, where $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ are positive constants and $n$ is the total
number of vertices. Under these assumptions, a fundamental limit on community
detection is characterized using the Hellinger distance between the two
distributions. If $\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(\sqrt{\alpha_i} - \sqrt{\beta_i})}^2 >2$,
then the community detection via maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is possible
with high probability. If $\sum_{i=1}^m {(\sqrt{\alpha_i} - \sqrt{\beta_i})}^2
< 2$, the probability that the ML estimator fails to detect the communities
does not go to zero.
