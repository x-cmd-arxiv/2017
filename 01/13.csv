  Respect to Points","18 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the fully-dynamic conflict-free coloring problem for a set $S$
of intervals in $\mathbb{R}^1$ with respect to points, where the goal is to
maintain a conflict-free coloring for$S$ under insertions and deletions. A
coloring is conflict-free if for each point $p$ contained in some interval, $p$
is contained in an interval whose color is not shared with any other interval
containing $p$. We investigate trade-offs between the number of colors used and
the number of intervals that are recolored upon insertion or deletion of an
interval. Our results include:
  - a lower bound on the number of recolorings as a function of the number of
colors, which implies that with $O(1)$ recolorings per update the worst-case
number of colors is $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$, and that any strategy using
$O(1/\varepsilon)$ colors needs $\Omega(\varepsilon n^{\varepsilon})$
recolorings;
  - a coloring strategy that uses $O(\log n)$ colors at the cost of $O(\log n)$
recolorings, and another strategy that uses $O(1/\varepsilon)$ colors at the
cost of $O(n^{\varepsilon}/\varepsilon)$ recolorings;
  - stronger upper and lower bounds for special cases.
  We also consider the kinetic setting where the intervals move continuously
(but there are no insertions or deletions); here we show how to maintain a
coloring with only four colors at the cost of three recolorings per event and
show this is tight.

difficult, as it involves minimizing a function under a constraint on its
Hessian, which is computionally prohibitive to obtain in low symmetry systems,
especially if electronic structure calculations are used. We propose a method
that is inspired by the well-known dimer method for saddle point searches but
that adds the necessary ingredients to solve for the lowest onset of mechanical
instability. The method consists of two nested optimization problems. The inner
one involves a dimer-like construction to find the direction of smallest
curvature as well as the gradient of this curvature function. The outer
optimization then minimizes energy using the result of the inner optimization
problem to constrain the search to the hypersurface enclosing all points of
zero minimum curvature. Example applications to both model systems and

against general attacks in a realistic finite-size regime is an outstanding
open problem in the field of theoretical quantum cryptography if we restrict
our attention to protocols that rely on the exchange of coherent states.
Indeed, techniques based on the uncertainty principle are not known to work for
such protocols, and the usual tools based on de Finetti reductions only provide
security for unrealistically large block lengths. We address this problem here
by considering a new type of Gaussian de Finetti reduction, that exploits the
invariance of some continuous-variable protocols under the action of the
unitary group $U(n)$ (instead of the symmetric group $S_n$ as in usual de
Finetti theorems), and by introducing generalized $SU(2,2)$ coherent states.
Our reduction shows that it is sufficient to prove the security of these
protocols against Gaussian collective attacks in order to obtain security
against general attacks, thereby confirming rigorously the widely held belief
that Gaussian attacks are indeed optimal against such protocols.

fully nonlinear uniformly parabolic Cauchy problems accompanied with rapidly
oscillating initial data. Such result is new even for linear problems. Here we
construct higher order initial layer and interior correctors, which describe
the oscillatory behavior near the initial and interior time zone of the domain.
To construct higher order correctors, we develop a regularity theory in
macroscopic scales, and prove an exponential decay estimate for initial layer
correctors.
  The higher order expansion requires an iteration process: successively
correcting the initial layer, then the interior. This leads to a more
complicated asymptotic expansion, as compared to the non-oscillating data case,
and this complexity is present even in the linear case.
  A notable observation for fully nonlinear operators is that even if the given
operator is space-time periodic, the interior correctors become aperiodic in
the time variable as we proceed with the iteration process. Moreover, each
interior corrector of higher order is paired with a space-time periodic
version, and the difference between the two decays exponentially fast with
time.

community due to their significantly lower computational and memory cost. They
are particularly well suited to reconfigurable logic devices, which contain an
abundance of fine-grained compute resources and can result in smaller, lower
power implementations, or conversely in higher classification rates. Towards
this end, the Finn framework was recently proposed for building fast and
flexible field programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerators for BNNs. Finn
utilized a novel set of optimizations that enable efficient mapping of BNNs to
hardware and implemented fully connected, non-padded convolutional and pooling
layers, with per-layer compute resources being tailored to user-provided
throughput requirements. However, FINN was not evaluated on larger topologies
due to the size of the chosen FPGA, and exhibited decreased accuracy due to
lack of padding. In this paper, we improve upon Finn to show how padding can be
employed on BNNs while still maintaining a 1-bit datapath and high accuracy.
Based on this technique, we demonstrate numerous experiments to illustrate
flexibility and scalability of the approach. In particular, we show that a
large BNN requiring 1.2 billion operations per frame running on an ADM-PCIE-8K5
platform can classify images at 12 kFPS with 671 us latency while drawing less

explore their interaction with light in the so-called optomechanical cavities.
Because of their challenging design, these cavities are traditionally
fabricated using dedicated high-resolution electron-beam lithography tools that
are inherently slow, limiting this solution to small-scale applications or
research. Here we show how to overcome this problem by using a deep-UV
photolithography process to fabricate optomechanical crystals on a commercial
CMOS foundry. We show that a careful design of the photonic crystals can
withstand the limitations of the photolithography process, producing cavities
with measured intrinsic optical quality factors as high as
$Q_{i}=(1.21\pm0.02)\times10^{6}$. Optomechanical crystals are also created
using phononic crystals to tightly confine the sound waves within the optical
cavity that results in a measured vacuum optomechanical coupling rate of
$g_{0}=2\pi\times(91\pm4)$ kHz. Efficient sideband cooling and amplification
are also demonstrated since these cavities are in the resolved sideband regime.
Further improvement in the design and fabrication process suggest that
commercial foundry-based optomechanical cavities could be used for quantum

nature of dark energy at astrophysical scales. For lensing system as an
isolated astrophysical object, we derive the dark energy contribution to
gravitational potential as a repulsive power-law term, containing a generic
equation of state parameter $w$. We find that it generates $w$-dependent and
position-dependent modification to the conventional light orbital equation of
$w=-1$. With post-Newtonian approximation, we compute its direct effect for an
isolated lensing system at astrophysical scales and find that the dark energy
force can deflect the path of incident light rays. We demonstrate that the
dark-energy-induced deflection angle $\Delta\alpha_{DE}^{}\propto
M^{(1+\frac{1}{3w})}$ (with $1+\frac{1}{3w}>0$), which increases with the
lensing mass $M$ and consistently approaches zero in the limit $M \to 0$. This
effect is distinctive because dark energy tends to diffuse the rays and
generates concave lensing effect. This is in contrast to the conventional
convex lensing effect caused by both visible and dark matter. Measuring such
concave lensing effect can directly probe the existence and nature of dark
energy. We estimate this effect and show that the current gravitational lensing
experiments are sensitive to the direct probe of dark energy at astrophysical
scales. For the special case $w=-1$, our independent study favors the previous
works that the cosmological constant can affect light bending, although our
prediction qualitatively and quantitatively differ from the literature,
including our consistent realization of $\Delta\alpha_{DE}\to 0$ (under $M \to
0$) at the leading order.

photonic crystal, whose interlayer distance along the propagation direction is
gradually varied, has been theoretically predicted and experimentally
demonstrated. The phenomenon is shown to be related to the progressive slowing
down and stopping of the incoming wave, as a result of the gradual variation of
the local dispersion. The light localization is chromatically resolved, since
every frequency component is stopped and reflected back at different spatial
positions. It has been further discussed that the peculiar relation between the
stopping distance and the wave vector distribution can substantially increase
the enhancement factor to more than two orders of magnitude. Compared to
previously reported one- and two-dimensional photonic crystal configurations,
the proposed scheme has the advantage of reducing the propagation losses by
providing a three-dimensional photonic bandgap confinement in all directions.
The slowing down and localization of waves inside photonic media can be
exploited in many applications that requires enhanced interaction of light and
matter.

continuous range of frequencies, that cuts off at a maximum (Debye)
temperature, $T_D$. We show that at low temperatures $T < T_D$, the
conservation of the equivalence principle in EGT requires a modification of the
Davies-Unruh effect. While the maintenance of Davies-Unruh effect requires a
violation of the equivalence principle. These two possibilities are
equivalents, because both can emulate the same quantity of dark matter.
However, in both cases, the central mechanism is the Davies-Unruh effect, this
seems to indicate that the modification of the Davies-Unruh effect emulates
dark matter which in turn can be see as a violation of the equivalence

gradients in [Mg/Fe] for barred galaxies are mostly positive, while for
unbarred bulges the [Mg/Fe] profiles are typically negative or flat. This
result, together with the old populations observed in the barred sample,
indicates that bars are long-lasting structures, and therefore are not easily
destroyed. The marked [Mg/Fe] differences with the bulges of unbarred galaxies
indicate that different formation/evolution scenarios are required to explain
their build-up, and emphasizes the role of bars in redistributing stellar
material in the bulge dominated regions.

For galaxies with stellar masses log($M_{\star}$) $<$ 11 M$_{\odot}$ in

fractions of galaxies near filaments are statistically indistinguishable from
the control sample. Galaxies with stellar masses log($M_{\star}$) $\geq$ 11

that this is evidence for massive galaxies accreting cold gas from the

accretion where filament galaxies with a large gravitational potential can draw
gas from the large-scale structure.

resolution observations of the [CII]158$\mu$m line in a normal star forming
galaxy at z$=$7.1. Previous [CII] observations of this galaxy had detected
[CII] emission consistent with the Ly$\alpha$ redshift but spatially slightly
offset relative to the optical (UV-rest frame) emission. The new [CII]
observations reveal that the [CII] emission is partly clumpy and partly diffuse
on scales larger than about 1kpc. [OIII] emission is also detected at high
significance, offset relative to the optical counterpart in the same direction
as the [CII] clumps, but mostly not overlapping with the bulk of the [CII]
emission. The offset between different emission components (optical/UV and
different far-IR tracers) is similar to what observed in much more powerful
starbursts at high redshift. We show that the [OIII] emitting clump cannot be
explained in terms of diffuse gas excited by the UV radiation emitted by the
optical galaxy, but it requires excitation by in-situ (slightly dust obscured)
star formation, at a rate of about 7 M$_{\odot}$/yr. Within 20 kpc from the
optical galaxy the ALMA data reveal two additional [OIII] emitting systems,
which must be star forming companions. We discuss that the complex properties
revealed by ALMA in the z$\sim$7.1 galaxy are consistent with expectations by
recent models and cosmological simulations, in which differential dust
extinction, differential excitation and different metal enrichment levels,
associated with different subsystems assembling a galaxy, are responsible for
the different appearance of the system when observed with different tracers.

disorder the non-interacting band structure hosts a quadratic band crossing.
Though the clean Coulomb problem is believed to host a 'non-Fermi liquid'
phase, disorder and Coulomb interactions have the same scaling dimension in a
renormalization group (RG) sense, and thus should be treated on an equal
footing. We therefore implement a controlled $\epsilon$-expansion and apply it
at leading order to derive RG flow equations valid when disorder and
interactions are both weak. We find that the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is
unstable to disorder, and demonstrate that the problem inevitably flows to
strong coupling, outside the regime of applicability of the perturbative RG. An
examination of the flow to strong coupling suggests that disorder is
asymptotically more important than interactions, so that the low energy
behavior of the system can be described by a non-interacting sigma model in the
appropriate symmetry class (which depends on whether exact particle-hole
symmetry is imposed on the problem). We close with a discussion of general
principles unveiled by our analysis that dictate the interplay of disorder and
Coulomb interactions in gapless semiconductors, and of connections to many-body
localized systems with long-range interactions.

compact massive (M > 5x10^10 M_sun) galaxies within the redshift range of

variance that has hampered the calculation of the number density for this
enigmatic population in many previous studies. We undertake an exhaustive
analysis in an effort to untangle the various findings inherent to the diverse
definition of compactness present in the literature. We find that the absolute
number of compact galaxies is very dependent on the adopted definition and can
change up to a factor of >10. We systematically measure a factor of ~5 more
compacts at the same redshift than what was previously reported on smaller
fields with HST imaging, which are more affected by cosmic variance. This means
that the decrease in number density from z ~ 1.5 to z ~ 0.2 might be only of a
factor of ~2-5, significantly smaller than what previously reported. This
supports progenitor bias as the main contributor to the size evolution. This
milder decrease is roughly compatible with the predictions from recent

dynamics whenever the local acceleration is above the critical $a_{0}=1.2
\times 10^{-10} m s^{-2}$, and enter a modified regime for accelerations below
this critical value. Indeed, the dark matter phenomenology on galactic and
subgalactic scales appears always, and only, at low accelerations. It is
standard to find the $a<a_{0}$ regime towards the low density outskirts of
astronomical systems, where under a Newtonian interpretation, dark matter
becomes conspicuous. Thus, it is standard to find, and to think, of the dense
central regions of observed systems as purely Newtonian. However, under
spherical symmetry in the MONDian as in the Newtonian case, the local
acceleration will tend to zero as one approaches the very centre of a mass
distribution. It is clear that for spherically symmetric systems, an inner
$a<a_{0}$ region will necessarily appear interior to a critical radius which
will depend on the details of the density profile in question. Here we
calculate analytically such a critical radius for a constant density core, and
numerically for a cored isothermal profile. Under a Newtonian interpretation,
such a central MONDian region will be interpreted as extra mass, analogous to
the controversial black holes sometimes inferred to lie at the centres of
globular clusters, despite an absence of nuclear activity detected to date. We
calculate this effect and give predictions for the ""central black hole"" mass to
be expected under Newtonian interpretations of low density Galactic globular
clusters.

the scheme is also weakly space-time scalable, since it leads to asymptotically
constant iterations when solving larger problems both in space and time.

We have investigated how universal and persistent the TFR reversal is. The

cylindrical map of the planet with spatial resolution of ~1500 km at the
equator. We have examined the data for atmospheric waves and observed a
prominent bright belt of radio hotspot features near 10N, likely connected to
the same equatorial wave associated with the 5-micron hotspots. We conducted a
passive tracer power spectral wave analysis for the entire map. The power
spectra analysis revealed that the atmosphere sampled in our observation
(excluding the NEB region) is in a 2-D turbulent regime and its dynamics are
predominately governed by the shallow water equations. The GRS is also very
prominent and has a noticeable meridional asymmetry and we compare it, and
nearby storms, with optical images. We find that the meridional radio profile
has a global north-south hemisphere distinction and find correlations of it to
optical intensity banding and to shear zones of the zonal wind profile over
select regions of latitude. Amateur optical images taken before and after our
observation complemented the radio wavelength map to investigate dynamics of
the equatorial region in Jupiter's atmosphere. We find that two radio hotspots
at 2 cm are well correlated with optical plumes in the NEB, additionally
revealing they are not the same 5 micron hotspot features correlated with
optical dark patches between adjacent plumes. This analysis exploits the VLA's
upgraded sensitivity and explores the opportunities now possible when studying
gas giants, especially atmospheric dynamics of layers beneath upper level

  Transportation Networks","Submitted to Applied Energy",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrified transportation and power systems are mutually coupled networks.
In this paper, a novel framework is developed for interdependent power and
transportation networks. Our approach constitutes solving an iterative least
cost vehicle routing process, which utilizes the communication of electrified
vehicles (EVs) with competing charging stations to exchange data, such as
electricity price, energy demand, and time of arrival. EV routing problem is
solved to minimize the total cost of travel using the Dijkstra algorithm with
the input from EVs battery management system, electricity price from charging
stations, powertrain component efficiencies, and transportation network traffic
conditions. Through the bidirectional communication of EVs with competing
charging stations, EVs charging demand estimation is done much more accurately.
Then, the optimal power flow problem is solved for the power system, to find
the locational marginal price at load buses where charging stations are
connected. Finally, the electricity prices are communicated from the charging
stations to the EVs, and the loop is closed. Locational electricity price acts
as the shared parameter between the two optimization problems, i.e. optimal
power flow and optimal routing problem. Electricity price depends on the power
demand, which is affected by the charging of EVs. On the other hand, location
of EV charging stations and their different pricing strategies might affect the
routing decisions of the EVs. Our novel approach that combines the electrified
transportation with power system operation, holds tremendous potential for
solving electrified transportation issues and reducing energy costs. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using Shanghai
transportation network and IEEE 9-bus test system. The results verify the
cost-savings for both power system and transportation networks.

models from nucleonic, hyperonic, strange quark matter and hybrid classes, we
numerically compute fast spinning stable stellar parameter values considering
the full effect of general relativity. This first detailed catalogue of the
computed parameter values of observed millisecond pulsars provides a testbed to
probe the physics of compact stars, including their formation, evolution and
EoS. We estimate uncertainties on these computed values from the uncertainty of
the measured mass, which could be useful to quantitatively constrain EoS
models. We note that the largest value of the central density $\rho_{\rm c}$ in
our catalogue is $\sim 5.8$ times the nuclear saturation density $\rho_{\rm

We argue that the $\rho_{\rm c}$-values of at most a small fraction of compact

significantly biased for some of our pulsars, if stellar $spinning$

exchange splitting is much greater than the lifetime broadening. For the case

the torque is generally perpendicular to the photon angular momentum and is

Dynamics Observatory (SDO)}. Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are observed
traveling sunward through the post-eruption plasma sheet. We calculate
differential emission measures using the AIA data and derive an emission
measure weighted average temperature in the supra-arcade region. In areas where
many SADs occur, the temperature of the supra-arcade plasma tends to increase,
while in areas where no SADs are observed, the temperature tends to decrease.
We calculate the plane-of-sky velocities in the supra-arcade plasma and use
them to calculate the potential heating due to adiabatic compression and
viscous heating. Ten of the 13 SADs studied have noticeable signatures in both
the adiabatic and the viscous terms. The adiabatic heating due to compression
of plasma in front of the SADs is on the order of 0.1 - 0.2 MK/s, which is
similar in magnitude to the estimated conductive cooling rate. This result
supports the notion that SADs contribute locally to the heating of plasma in
the supra-arcade region. We also find that in the region without SADs, the
plasma cools at a rate slower than the estimated conductive cooling, indicating
additional heating mechanisms may act globally to keep the plasma temperature
high.

physical-tagging (VIPT) for parallel TLB-L1 lookups means that L1 caches are
usually grown with greater associativity rather than sets. This compromises
performance -- by degrading access times without significantly boosting hit
rates -- and increases access energy. We propose VIPT Enhancements for

problems of VIPT by leveraging the increasing ubiquity of superpages; since
superpages have more page offset bits, they can accommodate L1 cache
organizations with more sets than baseline pages can. VESPA dynamically adapts
to any OS distribution of page sizes to operate L1 caches with good access
times, hit rates, and energy, for both single- and multi-threaded workloads.
Since the hardware changes are modest, and there are no OS or application
changes, VESPA is readily-implementable.

doesn't assume agents can be ""listening"" continuously. In other words, when an

Using a notion of ""promises"" about future control inputs, agents are able to
keep track of higher quality estimates about their neighbors allowing them to
stay disconnected from the cloud for longer periods of time while still
guaranteeing a positive contribution to the global task. We prove that our

regolith on asteroid (25143) Itokawa, visited by the JAXA Hayabusa spacecraft,

boulders commonly display well-rounded profiles and surface textures that
appear inconsistent with mechanical fragmentation during meteorite impact; the
rounded profiles have been hypothesized to arise from rolling and movement on
the surface as a consequence of seismic shaking. We provide a possible
explanation of these observations by exploring the primary crack propagation
mechanisms during thermal fatigue of a chondrite. We present the in situ
evolution of the full-field strains on the surface as a function of temperature
and microstructure, and observe and quantify the crack growth during thermal
cycling. We observe that the primary fatigue crack path preferentially follows
the interfaces between monominerals, leaving them intact after fragmentation.
These observations are explained through a microstructure-based finite element
model that is quantitatively compared with our experimental results. These
results on the interactions of thermal fatigue cracking with the microstructure
may ultimately allow us to distinguish between thermally induced fragments and
impact products.

child nodes, but adjacent parents share a common child node. Such trees arise
in finance when pricing an option. For example, valuation of a European option
can be carried out by evaluating the expected value of asset payoffs with
respect to random paths in the tree. In many variants of the option valuation
problem, a closed form solution cannot be obtained and computational methods
are needed. The cost to exactly compute expected values over random paths grows
exponentially in the depth of the tree, rendering a serial computation of one

significantly faster than a similarly written R code. A simulation study is

system is formed by an eccentric close spectroscopic binary (Ca1-Ca2) with a

field is strongly variable on timescales of a few days, with a most probable

and JaFu 2 in NGC 6441. Because single-star evolution at the low stellar mass
of present-epoch GCs was considered incapable of producing visible PNe, their
origin presented a puzzle. We imaged the PN JaFu 1 with the Hubble Space

high-resolution morphological information. We imaged IRAS 18333-2357 with
better depth and resolution, and we analyzed its archival HST spectra to
constrain its CS temperature and luminosity. All PNe in Galactic GCs now have
high-quality HST data, allowing us to improve CS mass estimates. We find

possibly detectable observational signatures. We will compare theoretical
predictions from this model with the observed total mass profile for a sample
of clusters of galaxies. The profiles are derived using two complementary
tools: X-ray hot intra-cluster gas dynamics, and strong and weak gravitational
lensing. We find that a dependence with the dynamical internal status of each
cluster is possible; for those clusters which are very close to be relaxed, and
thus less perturbed by possible astrophysical local processes, the galileon
model gives a quite good fit to both X-ray and lensing observations. Both
masses and concentrations for the dark matter halos are consistent with earlier
results found in numerical simulations and in the literature, and no compelling
statistical evidence for a deviation from general relativity is detectable from
the present observational state. Actually, the characteristic galileon
parameter $\Upsilon$ is always consistent with zero, and only an upper limit
($\lesssim0.086$ at $1\sigma$, $\lesssim0.16$ at $2\sigma$, and $\lesssim0.23$
at $3\sigma$) can be established. Some interesting distinctive deviations might
be operative, but the statistical validity of the results is far from strong,

potential tension with general relativity.

application using redundancy. We adopt the concept of handling faults in the
switches from non-real-time networks while maintaining the required
predictability.
  We study a class of forwarding schemes that can handle various types of
failures. We consider probabilistic failures. For a given network with a
forwarding scheme and a constant $\ell$, we compute the {\em score} of the
scheme, namely the probability (induced by faults) that at least $\ell$
messages arrive on time. We reduce the scoring problem to a reachability
problem on a Markov chain with a ""product-like"" structure. Its special
structure allows us to reason about it symbolically, and reduce the scoring
problem to #SAT. Our solution is generic and can be adapted to different
networks and other contexts. Also, we show the computational complexity of the
scoring problem is #P-complete, and we study methods to estimate the score. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our techniques with an implementation.

transformed one to another by specific, experimentally accessible operations.
It is clear that the latter characterization answers the fundamental question
`what can be transformed into what \textit{via} available means?'. Exactly such
an interpretations, i.e, in terms of mutual transformability can be clearly
formulated in terms of actions of specific groups on the space of states and is

the growth rate of dark matter halos during the Epoch of Reionization. By
comparing halo properties in a simplistic hydrodynamic simulation in which gas
only cools adiabatically, with its collisionless equivalent, we find that halo
growth is slowed as hydrostatic forces prevent gas from collapsing. In our
simulations, at the high redshifts relevant for reionization (between ${\sim}6$
and ${\sim}11$), halos that host dwarf galaxies ($\lesssim 10^{9}
\mathrm{M_\odot}$) can be reduced by up to a factor of 2 in mass due to the
hydrostatic pressure of baryons. Consequently, the inclusion of baryonic
effects reduces the amplitude of the low mass tail of the halo mass function by
factors of 2 to 4. In addition, we find that the fraction of baryons in dark
matter halos hosting dwarf galaxies at high redshift never exceeds ${\sim}90\%$
of the cosmic baryon fraction. When implementing baryonic processes, including
cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and reionization, the suppression
effects become more significant with further reductions of ${\sim}30\%$ to
60\%. Although convergence tests suggest that the suppression may become weaker
in higher resolution simulations, this suppressed growth will be important for
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, in which the halo mass inherited from
an underlying N-body simulation directly determines galaxy properties. Based on
the adiabatic simulation, we provide tables to account for these effects in
N-body simulations, and present a modification of the halo mass function along
with explanatory analytic calculations.

short-range repulsion and their multiples are operated to the AMD state as the
variational wave function. The total wave function is expressed as the sum of
all the components and the variational space can be increased successively with
the multiple correlation functions to achieve convergence. All the necessary
matrix elements of many-body operators, consisting of the multiple correlation
functions and the Hamiltonian, are expressed analytically using the Gaussian

double products of the correlation functions for the s-shell nuclei, 3H and

incomplete modal data where we can impose spatially-sparse stiffness changes
when updating a structural model. To this end, based on a similar hierarchical
sparse Bayesian learning model from our previous work, we propose two Gibbs
sampling algorithms. The algorithms differ in their strategies to deal with the
posterior uncertainty of the equation-error precision parameter, but both
sample from the conditional posterior probability density functions (PDFs) for
the structural stiffness parameters and system modal parameters. The effective
dimension for the Gibbs sampling is low because iterative sampling is done from
only three conditional posterior PDFs that correspond to three parameter
groups, along with sampling of the equation-error precision parameter from
another conditional posterior PDF in one of the algorithms where it is not
integrated out as a ""nuisance"" parameter. A nice feature from a computational
perspective is that it is not necessary to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem
of a structural model. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
algorithms are illustrated by applying them to the IASE-ASCE Phase II simulated
and experimental benchmark studies. The goal is to use incomplete modal data
identified before and after possible damage to detect and assess
spatially-sparse stiffness reductions induced by any damage. Our past and
current focus on meeting challenges arising from Bayesian inference of
structural stiffness serve to strengthen the capability of vibration-based
structural system identification but our methods also have much broader
applicability for inverse problems in science and technology where system
matrices are to be inferred from noisy partial information about their

increasing face images of different individuals. By naturally combining two
recently rising techniques: active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL),
our framework is capable of automatically annotating new instances and
incorporating them into training under weak expert re-certification. We first
initialize the classifier using a few annotated samples for each individual,
and extract image features using the convolutional neural nets. Then, a number
of candidates are selected from the unannotated samples for classifier
updating, in which we apply the current classifiers ranking the samples by the
prediction confidence. In particular, our approach utilizes the high-confidence
and low-confidence samples in the self-paced and the active user-query way,
respectively. The neural nets are later fine-tuned based on the updated
classifiers. Such heuristic implementation is formulated as solving a concise
active SPL optimization problem, which also advances the SPL development by
supplementing a rational dynamic curriculum constraint. The new model finely
accords with the ""instructor-student-collaborative"" learning mode in human
education. The advantages of this proposed framework are two-folds: i) The
required number of annotated samples is significantly decreased while the
comparable performance is guaranteed. A dramatic reduction of user effort is
also achieved over other state-of-the-art active learning techniques. ii) The
mixture of SPL and AL effectively improves not only the classifier accuracy
compared to existing AL/SPL methods but also the robustness against noisy data.
We evaluate our framework on two challenging datasets, and demonstrate very
promising results. (http://hcp.sysu.edu.cn/projects/aspl/)

confusion noise from an ensemble of faint, unresolved sources, one can in
principle detect transients below the classical confusion limit to the extent
that the classical confusion noise is independent of time. We develop a
technique for detecting radio transients that is based on temporal matched
filters applied directly to time series of images rather than relying on
source-finding algorithms applied to individual images. This technique has
well-defined statistical properties and is applicable to variable and transient
searches for both confusion-limited and non-confusion-limited instruments.

technique works well on real data despite the presence of classical confusion

transients lasting between 2 minutes and 3 months. We found no transients and
set improved upper limits on the transient surface density at 182 MHz for flux

in velocity, while the second one imposes a fixed speed in the limit, and thus
a reduction of the dynamics to a sphere in the velocity space. The analysis
relies on averaging techniques successfully used in the magnetic confinement of
charged particles. The limiting particle distribution is supported on a sphere,
and therefore we are forced to work with measures in velocity. As for the
Euler-type equations, the fluid model comes by integrating the kinetic equation

criterion for full-diversity space-time block codes (STBCs) is primarily
determined by the decoding method at the receiver. Although constructions of
STBCs have predominantly matched the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder, design
criteria and constructions of full-diversity STBCs have also been reported for
low-complexity linear receivers. A new receiver architecture called
Integer-Forcing (IF) linear receiver has been proposed to MIMO channels by Zhan
et al. which showed promising results for the high-rate V-BLAST encoding
scheme. In this work we address the design of full-diversity STBCs for IF
linear receivers. We derive an upper bound on the probability of decoding
error, and show that STBCs that satisfy the non-vanishing singular value (NVS)
property provide full-diversity for the IF receiver. We also present simulation
results to demonstrate that linear designs with NVS property provide full
diversity for IF receiver. As a special case of our analysis on STBCs, we
present an upper bound on the error probability for the V-BLAST architecture
presented by Zhan \emph{et al.}, and demonstrate that the IF linear receivers
provide full receive diversity. Our results supplement the existing outage

  Wireless Networks","To appear in the Proc. of IEEE WCNC 2017",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physical-layer group secret-key (GSK) generation is an effective way of
generating secret keys in wireless networks, wherein the nodes exploit inherent
randomness in the wireless channels to generate group keys, which are
subsequently applied to secure messages while broadcasting, relaying, and other
network-level communications. While existing GSK protocols focus on securing
the common source of randomness from external eavesdroppers, they assume that
the legitimate nodes of the group are trusted. In this paper, we address
insider attacks from the legitimate participants of the wireless network during
the key generation process. Instead of addressing conspicuous attacks such as
switching-off communication, injecting noise, or denying consensus on group
keys, we introduce stealth attacks that can go undetected against
state-of-the-art GSK schemes. We propose two forms of attacks, namely: (i)
different-key attacks, wherein an insider attempts to generate different keys
at different nodes, especially across nodes that are out of range so that they
fail to recover group messages despite possessing the group key, and (ii)
low-rate key attacks, wherein an insider alters the common source of randomness
so as to reduce the key-rate. We also discuss various detection techniques,
which are based on detecting anomalies and inconsistencies on the channel
measurements at the legitimate nodes. Through simulations we show that GSK
generation schemes are vulnerable to insider-threats, especially on topologies
that cannot support additional secure links between neighbouring nodes to
verify the attacks.

considers simpler motion models, such as rigid transformation and similarity
transformation. (2) To achieve a high processing speed, optical-flow based

Stage II undertakes the task of real-time video stabilization using a

has also been devoted to elucidate the effects of the particle size on the
thermal and magnetic phase transition features of these systems. For
nanoparticles with imperfect surface layers, it is found that bigger particles
exhibit lower compensation point which decreases gradually with increasing
amount of vacancies, and vanishes at a critical value. In view of nanoparticles
with diluted interface, our Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that there
exists a region in the disorder spectrum where compensation temperature
linearly decreases with decreasing dilution parameter. For nanoparticles with
roughened interface, it is observed that the degree of roughness does not play
any significant role on the variation of both the compensation point and

random features required by kernel models, we propose a simple but effective
method for feature selection. The method is able to explore a large number of

existing approaches. Second, we present a number of frame-level metrics which
correlate very strongly with recognition performance when computed on the

metrics during training in order to decide when to stop learning. This
technique can noticeably improve the recognition performance of both DNN and
kernel models, while narrowing the gap between them. Additionally, we show that
the linear bottleneck method of Sainath et al. (2013) improves the performance
of our kernel models significantly, in addition to speeding up training and
making the models more compact. Together, these three methods dramatically
improve the performance of kernel acoustic models, making their performance

valleys as a consequence of spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry
breaking, leading to a valley analog of Zeeman effect in presence of
out-of-plane magnetic field. As inversion symmetry is recovered in bilayers,
the emission helicity should no longer be locked to the valleys. Here we show
that Zeeman splitting, however, still persists in bilayers, as a result of an
additional degree of freedom viz., the layer pseudospin and spin-valley-layer
locking. In contrast to monolayer, Zeeman splitting here exists without lifting
valley degeneracy. The degree of circularly polarized photoluminescence can be
tuned with magnetic field from $-27\%$ to $27\%$. Our results demonstrate the

Hamiltonians. Furthermore, correlated many-particle states can emerge due to
the interaction with itinerant electrons of the electrodes, making these
systems ideal prototypical quantum systems. In this manuscript more complex
bipartite and spin-chains will be discussed additionally. Their spectra enable
to determine precisely the nature of the interactions between the spins which
can lead to the formation of new quantum states which emerge by interatomic

under generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) decoding [2], although
this decoder has never been stated for SS codes. In this contribution we
introduce the GAMP decoder for SS codes, we confirm empirically the

compare the performance of GAMP with the Bayes-optimal MMSE decoder. We
empirically illustrate that despite the presence of a phase transition
preventing GAMP to reach the optimal performance, spatial coupling allows to
boost the performance that eventually tends to capacity in a proper limit. We
also prove that, in contrast with the AWGNC case, SS codes for binary input

cosmological models and gravity. In particular the matter power spectrum $P(k)$
brings information about the cosmological distance evolution and the galaxy
clustering together. However the building of $P(k)$ from galaxy catalogues
needs a cosmological model to convert angles on the sky and redshifts into
distances, which leads to difficulties when comparing data with predicted
$P(k)$ from other cosmological models, and for photometric surveys like LSST.
The angular power spectrum $C_\ell(z_1,z_2)$ between two bins located at
redshift $z_1$ and $z_2$ contains the same information than the matter power
spectrum, is free from any cosmological assumption, but the prediction of
$C_\ell(z_1,z_2)$ from $P(k)$ is a costly computation when performed exactly.
The Angpow software aims at computing quickly and accurately the auto

Chebyshev polynomial basis and on the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature method. We
validate the results with other codes, and benchmark the performance. Angpow is
flexible and can handle any user defined power spectra, transfer functions, and
redshift selection windows. The code is fast enough to be embedded inside

  To every Bernstein component of enhanced Langlands parameters for G we
canonically associate an affine Hecke algebra (possibly extended with a finite

the set of central characters of the algebra is naturally in bijection with the

bijections send tempered or (essentially) square-integrable representations to
the expected kind of Langlands parameters.
  Furthermore we check that for many reductive p-adic groups, if a Bernstein
component B for G corresponds to a Bernstein component B^\vee of enhanced
Langlands parameters via the local Langlands correspondence, then the affine
Hecke algebra that we associate to B^\vee is Morita equivalent with the Hecke

whose luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit for a 10 Msun black hole (BH).
Their properties have been widely interpreted in terms of accreting
stellar-mass or intermediate-mass BHs. However at least three neutron stars
(NSs) have been recently identified in ULXs through the discovery of periodic
pulsations. Motivated by these findings we studied the spectral properties of a
sample of bright ULXs using a simple continuum model which was extensively used
to fit the X-ray spectra of accreting magnetic NSs in the Galaxy. We found that
such a model, consisting of a power-law with a high-energy exponential cut-off,
fits very well most of the ULX spectra analyzed here, at a level comparable to
that of models involving an accreting BH. On these grounds alone we suggest
that other non-pulsating ULXs may host NSs. We found also that above 2 keV the
spectrum of known pulsating ULXs is harder than that of the majority of the
other ULXs of the sample, with only IC 342 X-1 and Ho IX X-1 displaying spectra
of comparable hardness. We thus suggest that these two ULXs may host an
accreting NS and encourage searches for periodic pulsations in the flux.

substrates and high quality factor microdisks (MDs) under different atmospheric
conditions. Fast PL decay, peak blueshift and linewidth broadening due to
photooxidation have been observed at low excitation power. With further
increasing of the excitation power, the PL peak position shows a redshift and
linewidth becomes narrow, which is ascribed to the enhanced F$\ddot{o}$rster
resonant energy transfer between different QDs by photoinduced agglomeration.
The oxygen plays an important role in optically induced PL decay which is
verified by reduced photobleaching effect in vacuum. When the QDs drop-casted
on MDs, photooxidation and photobleaching are accelerated because the
excitation efficiency is greatly enhanced with coupling the pumping laser with
the cavity modes. However, when the emitted photons couple with cavity modes, a
PL enhancement by more than 20 times is achieved because of the increased
extraction efficiency and Purcell effects of MDs at room temperature (RT), and
35 times at 20 K. The photobleaching can be avoided with a small excitation
power but with a strong PL intensity by taking advantages of high quality
factor cavities. The high efficient PL emission without photodegradation is
very promising for using CuInS$_{2}$ QDs as high efficient photon emitters at
RT, where the photodegradation has always been limiting the practical
applications of colloidal quantum dots.

Here we examine the possibility that disassortativity in complex networks is
the origin of fractality. To this end, maximally disassortative (MD) networks
are prepared by rewiring edges while keeping the degree sequence of an initial
uncorrelated scale-free network that is guaranteed to become fractal by
rewiring edges. Our results show that most of MD networks with different

cause the fractal property of networks. In addition, we suggest that fractality

several times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc.
High-speed observations of bubble bursting reveal that the position at which a

On average, the rupture is initiated close to the bubble foot for low

communicates with two receivers over an error-free rate-limited link of
capacity $R_0$, as well as error-free rate-limited individual links of

receivers reproduce the source component $S^n_2$ losslessly; and Receiver $1$
also reproduces the source component $S^n_1$ lossily, to within some prescribed

Important in this setup, the side information sequences are arbitrarily

assumed to exhibit any particular ordering. Furthermore, by specializing the

all sensors measure some aspects of the system of interest with additional
sensor-specific and irrelevant components. Our goal is to recover the variables
relevant to the observed system and to filter out the nuisance effects of the
sensor-specific variables. We propose an approach based on manifold learning,
which is particularly suitable for problems with multiple modalities, since it
aims to capture the intrinsic structure of the data and relies on minimal prior
model knowledge. Specifically, we propose a nonlinear filtering scheme, which
extracts the hidden sources of variability captured by two or more sensors,
that are independent of the sensor-specific components. In addition to
presenting a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our technique on real
measured data for the purpose of sleep stage assessment based on multiple,
multimodal sensor measurements. We show that without prior knowledge on the
different modalities and on the measured system, our method gives rise to a
data-driven representation that is well correlated with the underlying sleep
process and is robust to noise and sensor-specific effects.

problem and a \emph{Gray-Wyner} problem, under equivocation constraints.
Specifically, in the Helper problem, an encoder communicates with a legitimate
receiver through noise-free rate-limited public and private links; and an
external passive eavesdropper intercepts every information that is sent on the
public link. We study two classes of this model: i) when a pair of arbitrarily
correlated discrete memoryless sources is to be encoded such that one component
has to be recovered lossily at the legitimate receiver while the equivocation
about both components at the eavesdropper must be maintained no smaller than
some prescribed level; and ii) when the legitimate receiver reproduces both
components, one of which, that is recovered losslessly, has to be concealed
from the eavesdropper to some equivocation level. For both classes problems, we
establish single-letter characterizations of optimal
rate-distortion-equivocation tradeoffs in the discrete memoryless case. Next,
we extend our results to the case of two legitimate receivers, i.e., Gray-Wyner
network with equivocation constraints. Here, two legitimate receivers are
connected to the encoder each through a dedicated error-free private link as
well as a common error-free public link; and an external passive eavesdropper
overhears on the public link. We study two classes of this model that are
extensions of the aforementioned instances of Helper problems to the case of
two receivers. For each of the two classes, we establish a single-letter
characterization of the optimal rate-distortion-equivocation region. Throughout

illustrate the results by computing them for some binary examples. Also, we

the hole by confining it to its birth site. However, for large N, the hole is

gamma ray emission based on the detection of the Cherenkov radiation produced
in the interaction of gamma rays with the Earth atmosphere. One of the key
elements of such instruments is a pixelized focal-plane camera consisting of
photodetectors. To date, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been the common
choice given their high photon detection efficiency (PDE) and fast time
response. Recently, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are emerging as an
alternative. This rapidly evolving technology has strong potential to become
superior to that based on PMTs in terms of PDE, which would further improve the
sensitivity of IACTs, and see a price reduction per square millimeter of
detector area. We are working to develop a SiPM-based module for the
focal-plane cameras of the MAGIC telescopes to probe this technology for IACTs
with large focal plane cameras of an area of few square meters. We will
describe the solutions we are exploring in order to balance a competitive
performance with a minimal impact on the overall MAGIC camera design using ray
tracing simulations. We further present a comparative study of the overall

affecting the theoretical predictions. In particular, we show that errors on
the \sigma_{\mu}/\sigma_e ratio are much smaller than 5%, and also much smaller
than the size of the SF+RPA nuclear corrections, which produce significant

(BKT) transitions with intermediate hexatic phase. The conventional first-order
transition is also possible. On the other hand, recently on the basis of

type solid-hexatic transition and first order hexatic-liquid transition.
However, in the simulations the hexatic phase is extremely narrow that makes
its study difficult. In the present paper, we propose to apply the random
pinning to investigate the hexatic phase in more detail. The results of
molecular dynamics simulations of two dimensional system having core-softened
potentials with narrow repulsive step which is similar to the soft disk system
are outlined. The system has a small fraction of pinned particles giving
quenched disorder. Random pinning widens the hexatic phase without changing the

diffusivity and order parameters in the vicinity of the melting transition and
inside the hexatic phase.

scalar perturbation around uncharged black branes where an overdamping was
observed to start at $z=2$ and independent of the value of scalar mass, our
observation discloses that the overdamping starting point is no longer at $z=2$

  Pairwise Constraints","13pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their variants are usually trained
by contrastive divergence (CD) learning, but the training procedure is an
unsupervised learning approach, without any guidances of the background
knowledge. To enhance the expression ability of traditional RBMs, in this
paper, we propose pairwise constraints restricted Boltzmann machine with
Gaussian visible units (pcGRBM) model, in which the learning procedure is
guided by pairwise constraints and the process of encoding is conducted under
these guidances. The pairwise constraints are encoded in hidden layer features
of pcGRBM. Then, some pairwise hidden features of pcGRBM flock together and
another part of them are separated by the guidances. In order to deal with
real-valued data, the binary visible units are replaced by linear units with
Gausian noise in the pcGRBM model. In the learning process of pcGRBM, the
pairwise constraints are iterated transitions between visible and hidden units
during CD learning procedure. Then, the proposed model is inferred by
approximative gradient descent method and the corresponding learning algorithm
is designed in this paper. In order to compare the availability of pcGRBM and
traditional RBMs with Gaussian visible units, the features of the pcGRBM and
RBMs hidden layer are used as input 'data' for K-means, spectral clustering
(SP) and affinity propagation (AP) algorithms, respectively. A thorough
experimental evaluation is performed with sixteen image datasets of Microsoft
Research Asia Multimedia (MSRA-MM). The experimental results show that the
clustering performance of K-means, SP and AP algorithms based on pcGRBM model
are significantly better than traditional RBMs. In addition, the pcGRBM model
for clustering task shows better performance than some semi-supervised
clustering algorithms.

not due to thermally--driven expansion of the HII regions, but to momentum

that the ""na\""ive"" standard scenario, in which the back electrode and the

fails in describing the observed phenomenology. Anomalies appearing after the
first low-temperature application of a positive gate bias, and causing a

either obtained by a long room-temperature field annealing, or,
instantaneously, by a relatively modest dose of visible-range photons.
Illumination causes a sudden collapse of the electron system back to the
metallic ground state, with a resistivity drop exceeding four orders of
magnitude. The data are discussed and interpreted on the base of the analogy
with floating-gate MOSFET devices, which sheds a new light on the effects of

states lie at the extrema of the Floquet eigenvalues of the bulk system, and
the peaks of the Fourier transforms of the surface state wave functions lie at
the momenta where the bulk Floquet eigenvalues have extrema. For the case of
zero surface momentum, we can analytically derive scaling relations between the
decay length of the surface states and the amplitude and penetration length of
the radiation. For topological insulators, we again find that circularly

larger decay lengths than the surface states which are present even in the

For quasi radial ambient magnetic field the expansion drives
$T_{\mathrm{p}\|}>T_{\mathrm{p}\perp}$ and the system becomes eventually
unstable with respect to the dominant parallel fire hose instability. This
instability is generally unable to counteract the induced anisotropization and
the system typically becomes unstable with respect to the oblique fire hose

However, interaction with the substrate, which is necessary to support the
electronically active medium, becomes a major obstacle. In the present work, we
propose a substrate (F-doped WS$_2$) that avoids detrimental effects and at the
same time induces the required valley polarization, so that no further steps
are needed for this purpose. The behavior is explained by proximity effects on
silicene/germanene, as demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Broken
inversion symmetry due to the presence of WS$_2$ opens a substantial band gap
in silicene/germanene. F doping of WS$_2$ results in spin polarization, which,
in conjunction with proximity-enhanced spin orbit coupling, creates sizable
spin-valley polarization.

stars to have larger velocity dispersions. This relation is called the
age-velocity dispersion relation (AVR) and it is believed to provide insight
into the heating history of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, in order to investigate
the origin of the AVR, we performed smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations
of the self-gravitating multiphase gas disks in the static disk-halo
potentials. Star formation from cold and dense gas is taken into account, and
we analyze the evolution of these star particles. We find that exponents of
simulated AVR and the ratio of the radial to vertical velocity dispersion are
close to the observed values. We also find that the simulated AVR is not a
simple consequence of dynamical heating. The evolution tracks of stars with
different epochs evolve gradually in the age-velocity dispersion plane as a
result of: (1) the decrease in velocity dispersion in star forming regions, and
(2) the decrease in the number of cold/dense/gas as scattering sources. These
results suggest that the AVR involves not only the heating history of a stellar
disk, but also the historical evolution of the ISM in a galaxy.

binary relations from input to output (finite) words. In LT, the input/output

position of the output word, the input position from which it originates. LT is
well-suited to express relations (which are not necessarily functional), and
can express all regular functional transductions, i.e. transductions definable

from any transduction R defined in LT , it is possible to synthesise a regular
functional transduction f such that for all input words u in the domain of R, f
is defined and (u,f(u)) belongs to R. As a consequence, we obtain that any

These active agents are subject to strong stochastic fluctuations, that compete
with the directed motion. So far most studies consider the lowest order moments
of the displacements only, while more general spatio-temporal information on
the stochastic motion is provided in scattering experiments. Here we derive
analytically exact expressions for the directly measurable intermediate
scattering function for a mesoscopic model of a single, anisotropic active
Brownian particle in three dimensions. The mean-square displacement and the
non-Gaussian parameter of the stochastic process are obtained as derivatives of
the intermediate scattering function. These display different temporal regimes
dominated by effective diffusion and directed motion due to the interplay of
translational and rotational diffusion which is rationalized within the theory.
The most prominent feature of the intermediate scattering function is an
oscillatory behavior at intermediate wavenumbers reflecting the persistent
swimming motion, whereas at small length scales bare translational and at large
length scales an enhanced effective diffusion emerges. We anticipate that our
characterization of the motion of active agents will serve as a reference for
more realistic models and experimental observations.

equations and are therefore uniquely solvable for all frequencies. In
particular, a novel regularization of the hypersingular operator is obtained,
which, unlike regularizations based on Maue's integration-by-parts formula,
does not give rise to involved Cauchy principal value integrals. The smoothed
integral operators and layer potentials, on the other hand, can be numerically
evaluated at target points that are arbitrarily close to the boundary without
severely compromising their accuracy. A variety of numerical examples in two

found a positive backgate applied from STO is particularly effective in
enhancing Tc of the films while minimally changing the carrier density. We
suggest that the positive backgate tends to 'pull' the transferred electrons in

coupling to interfacial phonons and the electron-electron interaction within

  effects in radio interferometric imaging",,,"10.1093/mnras/stx1267",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radio interferometric imaging aims to estimate an unknown sky intensity image
from degraded observations, acquired through an antenna array. In the
theoretical case of a perfectly calibrated array, it has been shown that
solving the corresponding imaging problem by iterative algorithms based on
convex optimization and compressive sensing theory can be competitive with
classical algorithms such as CLEAN. However, in practice, antenna-based gains
are unknown and have to be calibrated. Future radio telescopes, such as the
SKA, aim at improving imaging resolution and sensitivity by orders of
magnitude. At this precision level, the direction-dependency of the gains must
be accounted for, and radio interferometric imaging can be understood as a
blind deconvolution problem. In this context, the underlying minimization
problem is non-convex, and adapted techniques have to be designed. In this
work, leveraging recent developments in non-convex optimization, we propose the
first joint calibration and imaging method in radio interferometry, with proven
convergence guarantees. Our approach, based on a block-coordinate
forward-backward algorithm, jointly accounts for visibilities and suitable
priors on both the image and the direction-dependent effects (DDEs). As
demonstrated in recent works, sparsity remains the prior of choice for the
image, while DDEs are modelled as smooth functions of the sky, i.e. spatially
band-limited. Finally, we show through simulations the efficiency of our
method, for the reconstruction of both images of point sources and complex
extended sources. MATLAB code is available on GitHub.

than the standard real-space formulation. In particular, we show that the
computational cost for fixed bond dimension of the hybrid-space DMRG is
approximately independent of the width of the lattice, in contrast to the
real-space DMRG, for which it is proportional to the width squared. We apply
the hybrid-space algorithm to calculate the ground state of the doped
two-dimensional Hubbard model on cylinders of width four and six sites; at
$n=0.875$ filling, the ground state exhibits a striped charge-density

We find that the strength of the charge ordering depends on $U/t$ and on the

considered an important source of mechanical energy for the ISM and a trigger
of molecular cloud formation. Their interaction sites are locations where
kinetic energy and magnetic fields are redistributed between ISM phases. In
this work we study the effect of the magnetic field on the expansion and
fragmentation of supershells and look for the signatures of supershell
collisions on dense structures and on the kinetic and magnetic energy
distribution of the ISM. We performed a series of high-resolution,
three-dimensional simulations of colliding supershells. The shocks are created
by time-dependent feedback and evolve in a diffuse turbulent environment that
is either unmagnetized or has different initial magnetic field configurations.
In the hydrodynamical situation, the expansion law of the superbubbles is
consistent with the radius-time relation that is theoretically predicted for
wind-blown bubbles. The supershells fragment over their entire surface into
small dense clumps that carry more than half of the total kinetic energy in the
volume. However, this is not the case when a magnetic field is introduced,
either in the direction of the collision or perpendicular to the collision. In
magnetized situations, the shell surfaces are more stable to dynamical
instabilities. When the magnetic field opposes the collision, the expansion law
of the supershells also becomes significantly flatter than in the
hydrodynamical case. Although a two-phase medium arises in all cases, in the
MHD simulations the cold phase is limited to lower densities.

Here, we use a recently-developed model to obtain predictions for the dynamical

antibiotic. Our results depend strongly on whether the antibiotic shows
reversible transport and/or low-affinity ribosome binding (""low-affinity
antibiotic"") or, in contrast, irreversible transport and/or high affinity
ribosome binding (""high-affinity antibiotic""). For low-affinity antibiotics,
our model predicts that growth inhibition depends on the duration of the
antibiotic pulse, with a transient period of very fast growth following removal
of the antibiotic. For high-affinity antibiotics, growth inhibition depends on
peak dosage rather than dose duration, and the model predicts a pronounced
post-antibiotic effect, due to hysteresis, in which growth can be suppressed
for long times after the antibiotic dose has ended. These predictions are
experimentally testable and may be of clinical significance.

with the recently-constructed unified NS EoSs. The calculations for pure quark
stars (QSs) and hybrid stars (HSs) are also done, using several updated quark
matter EoSs and Gibbs construction for obtaining hadron-quark mixed phase. All
three types of EoSs fulfill the recent 2-solar-mass constrain. By confronting
the glitch observations with the theoretical calculations for the crustal
moment of inertia (MoI), we find that the glitch crisis is still present in
Vela-like pulsars. An upcoming accurate MoI measurement (eg., a possible 10\%
accuracy for pulsar PSR J0737-3039A) could distinguish QSs from NSs, since the
MoIs of QSs are generally $> \sim 1.5 $ times larger than NSs and HSs, no
matter the compactness and the mass of the stars. Using tabulated EoSs, we
compute stationary and equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating, relativistic
stars in general relativity from the well-tested $rns$ code, assuming the
matter comprising the star to be a perfect fluid. All three observed properties
of the short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) internal plateaus sample are simulated
using the rotating configurations of NSs/QSs as basic input. We finally argue
that for some characteristic SGRBs, the post-merger products of NS-NS mergers
are probably supramassive QSs rather than NSs, and NS-NS mergers are a
plausible location for quark deconfinement and the formation of QSs.

their field programmability and low cost. However, they suffer from cosmic
radiation induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). In safety-critical applications,
the dependability of the design is a prime concern since failures may have
catastrophic consequences. An early analysis of the relationship between
dependability metrics, performability-area trade-off, and different mitigation
techniques for such applications can reduce the design effort while increasing
the design confidence. This paper introduces a novel methodology based on
probabilistic model checking, for the analysis of the reliability,
availability, safety and performance-area tradeoffs of safety-critical systems
for early design decisions. Starting from the high-level description of a
system, a Markov reward model is constructed from the Control Data Flow Graph
(CDFG) and a component characterization library targeting FPGAs. The proposed
model and exhaustive analysis capture all the failure states (based on the
fault detection coverage) and repairs possible in the system. We present
quantitative results based on an FIR filter circuit to illustrate the
applicability of the proposed approach and to demonstrate that a wide range of
useful dependability and performability properties can be analyzed using the
proposed methodology. The modeling results show the relationship between
different mitigation techniques and fault detection coverage, exposing their
direct impact on the design for early decisions.

However, the standard actuator line model does not include a model for the
turbine nacelle which can significantly impact turbine wake characteristics as
shown in the literature. Another disadvantage of the standard actuator line
model is that more geometrical features of turbine blades cannot be resolved on
a finer mesh. To alleviate these disadvantages of the standard model, we
develop a new class of actuator surface models for turbine blades and nacelle
to take into account more geometrical details of turbine blades and include the
effect of turbine nacelle. In the actuator surface model for blade, the
aerodynamic forces calculated using the blade element method are distributed
from the surface formed by the foil chords at different radial locations. In
the actuator surface model for nacelle, the forces are distributed from the
actual nacelle surface with the normal force component computed in the same way
as in the direct forcing immersed boundary method and the tangential force
component computed using a friction coefficient and a reference velocity of the
incoming flow. The actuator surface model for nacelle is evaluated by
simulating the flow over periodically placed nacelles. Both the actuator
surface simulation and the wall-resolved large-eddy simulation are carried out.
The comparison shows that the actuator surface model is able to give acceptable
results especially at far wake locations on a very coarse mesh. It is noted
that although this model is employed for the turbine nacelle in this work, it
is also applicable to other bluff bodies. The capability of the actuator
surface model in predicting turbine wakes is assessed by simulating the flow
over the MEXICO (Model experiments in Controlled Conditions) turbine and a
hydrokinetic turbine.
