As a finite complexity, we
propose a ""regularized complexity"" by employing a similar method to the
holographic renormalization. We add codimension-two boundary counterterms which
do not contain any boundary stress tensor information. It means that we
subtract only non-dynamic background and all the dynamic information of
holographic complexity is contained in the regularized part. After showing the
general counterterms for both CA and CV conjectures in holographic spacetime
dimension 5 and less, we give concrete examples: the BTZ black holes and the
four and five dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black holes. We propose how to
obtain the counterterms in higher spacetime dimensions and show explicit
formulas only for some special cases with enough symmetries. We also compute
the complexity of formation by using the regularized complexity.

still open in science. Several factors such as the existence of punishment,
fluctuations in finite systems, repeated interactions and the formation of
prestige may all contribute to explain the counter-intuitive prevalence of
cooperation in natural and social systems. The characteristics of the
interaction networks have been also signaled as an element favoring the
persistence of cooperators. Here we consider the invasion dynamics of
cooperative behaviors in complex topologies. The invasion of a heterogeneous
network fully occupied by defectors is performed starting from nodes with a
given number of connections (degree) $k_0$. The system is then evolved within a
Prisoner's Dilemma game and the outcome is analyzed as a function of $k_0$ and
the degree $k$ of the nodes adopting cooperation. Carried out using both
numerical and analytical approaches, our results show that the invasion
proceeds following preferentially a hierarchical order in the nodes from those
with higher degree to those with lower degree. However, the invasion of
cooperation will succeed only when the initial cooperators are numerous enough
to form a cluster from which cooperation can spread. This implies that the
initial condition must be a suitable equilibrium between high degree and high
numerosity, which usually takes place, when possible, at intermediate values of
$k_0$. These findings have potential applications, as they suggest that, in
order to promote cooperative behavior on complex networks, one should infect
with cooperators \emph{high but not too high} degree nodes.

notoriously difficult and quickly undecidable, even when restricted to

yielding the first decidable class of weighted timed games with negative

tends to strengthen at finite density. At lower temperatures nucleon density
fluctuations can cause a relative difference in the $U_A(1)$ axial anomaly of
about $20\%$. This has important consequences on the mesonic spectra,
especially on the $\eta-\eta'$ system, as we observe no drop in the $\eta'$

simulate an extension of a benchmark model of continuum percolation, the

orientation bias of the grains that controls the degree of anisotropy of the
generated patterns. We analyze in the Euclidean plane the percolation
thresholds above which percolating clusters in $x$- and in $y$-direction
emerge. Only in finite systems, distinct differences between effective
percolation thresholds for different directions appear. If extrapolated to
infinite system sizes, these differences vanish independent of the details of
the model. In the infinite system, the uniqueness of the percolating cluster
guarantees a unique percolation threshold. While percolation is isotropic even
for anisotropic processes, the value of the percolation threshold depends on
the model parameters, which we explore by simulating a score of models with
varying degree of anisotropy. To which precision can we predict the percolation
threshold without simulations? We discuss analytic formulas for approximations
(based on the excluded area or the Euler characteristic) and compare them to
our simulation results. Empirical parameters from similar systems allow for
accurate predictions of the percolation thresholds (with deviations of $<5\%$

approximations from integral geometry provide, at least for the systems studied
here, lower bounds that capture well the qualitative dependence of the

astrophysical neutrinos that are produced in interactions of cosmic rays, close
to their sources and in interstellar space. IceCube is the first instrument
that measures the properties of this astrophysical neutrino flux, and
constrains its origin. In addition, the spectrum, composition and anisotropy of
the local cosmic-ray flux are obtained from measurements of atmospheric muons

energy efficient cellular access with better cell coverage. The in-band
relaying solution, proposed in LTE-Advanced, improves coverage without
requiring additional spectrum for backhauling, making its deployment more
economical and practical. However, in-band relay without careful management
incurs low spectrum utilization and reduces the system capacity. We propose
auction-based solutions that aim at dynamic spectrum resource sharing,
maximizing the utilization of precious spectrum resources. We first present a
truthful auction that ensures a theoretical performance guarantee in terms of
social welfare. Then in an extended system model that focuses on addressing the
heterogeneity of resource blocks, we design a more practical auction mechanism.
We implement our proposed auctions under large scale real-world settings.
Simulation results verify the efficacy of proposed auctions, showing
improvements in both cell coverage and spectrum efficiency.

effective Lagrangians in which coupling constants are determined by the SU(3)

vector-meson and pseudoscalar-meson exchanges. With the one-boson-exchange
potential obtained, bound states from the $\Sigma^*K$ and $\Sigma K^*$
interactions are searched for in a quasipotential Bethe-Saltpeter equation
approach. A bound state with quantum number $I(J^P)=1/2(3/2^-)$ is produced
from the $\Sigma^*K$ interaction, which can be identified as the $N(1875)$
listed in PDG. It can be seen as a strange partner of the LHCb pentaquark
$P_c(4380)$ with the same quantum numbers in the molecular state picture. The
$\Sigma K^*$ interaction also produces a bound state with quantum number
$I(J^P)=1/2(3/2^-)$, which is related to experimentally observed $N(2100)$ in

the $K\Lambda(1520)$ photoproduction and the $N(2100)$ observed in the $\phi$

three-quark state while the latter is a $\Sigma K^*$ molecular state, which can

study the early stages of star cluster dynamics in a low-density environment.
We studied its structural and kinematical properties combining parameters from
the high-resolution spectroscopic survey Gaia-ESO with data from the
literature. Our main result is the evidence of a large discrepancy between the
velocity dispersion (sigma = 1.14 \pm 0.35 km s^{-1}) of the stellar population
and the dispersion of the pre-stellar cores (~0.3 km s^{-1}) derived from
submillimeter observations. The origin of this discrepancy, which has been
observed in other young star clusters is not clear. It may be due to either the
effect of the magnetic field on the protostars and the filaments, or to the
dynamical evolution of stars driven by two-body interactions. Furthermore, the
analysis of the kinematic properties of the stellar population put in evidence
a significant velocity shift (~1 km s^{-1}) between the two sub-clusters
located around the North and South main clouds. This result further supports a
scenario, where clusters form from the evolution of multiple substructures
rather than from a monolithic collapse.
  Using three independent spectroscopic indicators (the gravity indicator
$\gamma$, the equivalent width of the Li line, and the H_alpha 10\% width), we
performed a new membership selection. We found six new cluster members located
in the outer region of the cluster. Starting from the positions and masses of
the cluster members, we derived the level of substructure Q, the surface
density \Sigma and the level of mass segregation $\Lambda_{MSR}$ of the
cluster. The comparison between these structural properties and the results of
N-body simulations suggests that the cluster formed in a low density
environment, in virial equilibrium or supervirial, and highly substructured.

investigated on the basis of first principles of quantum electrodynamics. The
reflection coefficients and reflectivities of graphene-coated plates are
expressed in terms of the polarization tensor of gapped graphene and the
dielectric permittivity of plate material. Simple approximate expressions for
the required combinations of components of the polarization tensor applicable
in the wide frequency region, where the presence of a gap influences the
optical properties, are found. Numerical computations of the reflectivities of
graphene-coated SiO${}_2$ plates are performed for different values of the
mass-gap parameter at different temperatures. It is shown that with an
increasing gap width the reflectivity of a graphene-coated plate at the normal
incidence decreases by up to a factor of 8 depending on the values of frequency
and mass-gap parameter. The angle dependences of reflectivities for both
polarizations of the incident electromagnetic waves have been computed for Si
and SiO${}_2$ plates coated with gapped graphene. We demonstrate that the TM
reflectivity has a minimum value at some angle of incidence depending on the
mass-gap parameter, frequency and temperature, whereas the TE reflectivity
depends on the angle of incidence monotonously. However, for the graphene
coatings with a nonzero mass-gap parameter the reflected light cannot be fully
polarized. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.

properties with respect to bulk specimens made of the same material. However,
if a semiconductor alloy has a miscibility gap in its phase diagram, at
equilibrium it will phase separate, leading to deterioration of the
aforementioned properties. One way to prevent this separation is to grow the
material at low temperatures and therefore to suppress kinetics. Such growth
often needs to be followed by high-temperature annealing in order to rid the
system of undesirable growth-induced defects. In this study, we propose a
method to control phase separation in core-shell nanowires during high
temperature annealing by tailoring geometry and strain. Using a phase field
model we determined that phase separation in nanowires begins at the free
surface and propagates into the bulk. We discovered that including a thin shell
around the core delays the phase separation whereas a thick shell suppresses
the separation almost entirely.

coordinated, due to the vast cellular and D2D transmissions. To this end, this
paper introduces a spatially dynamic power control solution for mitigating the
cellular-to-D2D and D2D-to-cellular interference. In particular, the proposed
D2D power control policy is rather flexible including the special cases of no
D2D links or using maximum transmit power. Under the considered power control,
an analytical approach is developed to evaluate the spectral efficiency (SE)

for a cellular user or D2D transmitter are derived, which quantify the impacts
of key system parameters such as massive MIMO antennas and D2D density.
Moreover, the D2D scale properties are obtained, which provide the sufficient
conditions for achieving the anticipated SE. Numerical results corroborate our
analysis and show that the proposed power control solution can efficiently
mitigate interference between the cellular and D2D tier. The results
demonstrate that there exists the optimal D2D density for maximizing the area
SE of D2D tier. In addition, the achievable EE of a cellular user can be

number of atoms and their complexities, which requires a superexponential
alphabet.
  We also complete the previous results by characterizing state complexity of
product, star, and reversal, and establishing tight upper bounds for atom
complexities of bifix-free languages. We show that to meet the bound for
reversal we require at least 3 letters and to meet the bound for atom
complexities $n+1$ letters are sufficient and necessary. For the cases of
product, star, and reversal we show that there are no gaps (magic numbers) in
the interval of possible state complexities of the languages resulted from an
operation; in particular, the state complexity of the product $L_m L_n$ is
always $m+n-2$, while of the star is either $n-1$ or $n-2$.

experience the event of interest; they are considered to be `cured'. The
population is thus a mixture of two subpopulations: the one of cured subjects,
and the one of `susceptible' subjects. When covariates are present, a so-called
mixture cure model can be used to model the conditional survival function of
the population. It depends on two components: the probability of being cured
and the conditional survival function of the susceptible subjects. In this
paper we propose a novel approach to estimate a mixture cure model when the
data are subject to random right censoring. We work with a parametric model for
the cure proportion (like e.g. a logistic model), while the conditional
survival function of the uncured subjects is unspecified. The approach is based
on an inversion which allows to write the survival function as a function of
the distribution of the observable random variables. This leads to a very
general class of models, which allows a flexible and rich modeling of the
conditional survival function. We show the identifiability of the proposed
model, as well as the weak consistency and the asymptotic normality of the
model parameters. We also consider in more detail the case where kernel
estimators are used for the nonparametric part of the model. The new estimators
are compared with the estimators from a Cox mixture cure model via finite
sample simulations. Finally, we apply the new model and estimation procedure on
two medical data sets.

have, in order to guarantee that the resulting state can be renormalized:
$\lambda_c^{(n)} \ge 1/(n-1)$. We present a new way of formulating this problem

higher mass, it is notable that the hosts are all metal-rich, late-type stars.
With orbital separations that place both WASP-105b and WASP-107b in the

giant with a H/He-dominated composition. The planet thus sets a lower limit of
2.2 $M_{\rm Nep}$ on the planetary mass above which large gaseous envelopes can
be accreted and retained by proto-planets on their way to becoming gas giants.
We may discover whether WASP-107b more closely resembles an ice giant or a gas

measuring the spins of accreting black holes. However, the two approaches have
not been implemented together in a photon-conserving, self-consistent
framework. We develop such a framework using the black-hole X-ray binary GX
339-4 as a touchstone source, and we demonstrate three important ramifications:
(1) Compton scattering of reflection emission in the corona is routinely
ignored, but is an essential consideration given that reflection is linked to
the regimes with strongest Comptonization. Properly accounting for this causes
the inferred reflection fraction to increase substantially, especially for the
hard state. Another important impact of the Comptonization of reflection
emission by the corona is the downscattered tail. Downscattering has the
potential to mimic the relativistically-broadened red wing of the Fe line
associated with a spinning black hole. (2) Recent evidence for a reflection
component with a harder spectral index than the power-law continuum is
naturally explained as Compton-scattered reflection emission. (3) Photon
conservation provides an important constraint on the hard state's accretion
rate. For bright hard states, we show that disk truncation to large scales (R
much larger than the ISCO radius) is unlikely as this would require accretion
rates far in excess of the brightest soft states. Our principal conclusion is
that when modeling relativistically-broadened reflection, spectral models
should allow for coronal Compton scattering of the reflection features, and
when possible, take advantage of the additional constraining power from linking
to the thermal disk component.

a promising framework to non-invasively and inexpensively monitor or predict
the effectiveness of therapeutic cancer responses. One of the earliest steps in
using QUS methods is contouring a region of interest (ROI) inside the tumour in
ultrasound B-mode images. While manual segmentation is a very time-consuming
and tedious task for human experts, auto-contouring is also an extremely
difficult task for computers due to the poor quality of ultrasound B-mode
images. However, for the purpose of cancer response prediction, a rough
boundary of the tumour as an ROI is only needed. In this research, a
semi-automated tumour localization approach is proposed for ROI estimation in
ultrasound B-mode images acquired from patients with locally advanced breast
cancer (LABC). The proposed approach comprised several modules, including 1)
feature extraction using keypoint descriptors, 2) augmenting the feature
descriptors with the distance of the keypoints to the user-input pixel as the
centre of the tumour, 3) supervised learning using a support vector machine
(SVM) to classify keypoints as ""tumour"" or ""non-tumour"", and 4) computation of
an ellipse as an outline of the ROI representing the tumour. Experiments with
33 B-mode images from 10 LABC patients yielded promising results with an
accuracy of 76.7% based on the Dice coefficient performance measure. The
results demonstrated that the proposed method can potentially be used as the
first stage in a computer-assisted cancer response prediction system for
semi-automated contouring of breast tumours.

In this article, we formulate the evolution equation for the GMC mass function
to reproduce the observed profiles, for which multiple compression are driven
by the network of expanding shells due to HII regions and supernova remnants.
We introduce the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) terms in the evolution equation in
contrast to the previous work (Inutsuka et al. 2015). The computed time
evolution suggests that the GMC mass function slope is governed by the ratio of
GMC formation timescale to its dispersal timescale, and that the CCC effect is
limited only in the massive-end of the mass function. In addition, we identify
a gas resurrection channel that allows the gas dispersed by massive stars to
regenerate GMC populations or to accrete onto the pre-existing GMCs. Our
results show that almost all of the dispersed gas contribute to the mass growth
of pre-existing GMCs in arm regions whereas less than 60 per cent in inter-arm
regions. Our results also predict that GMC mass functions have a single
power-law exponent in the mass range < 10^5.5 Msun (where Msun represents the
solar mass), which is well characterized by GMC self-growth and dispersal
timescales. Measurement of the GMC mass function slope provides a powerful
method to constrain those GMC timescales and the gas resurrecting factor in

stellar disc experienced radial migration, but it also contains important clues
on the structure that triggered it. Specifically, the MDF contains information
about the dynamics and morphology of the spiral pattern. To constrain the
spiral parameters, we have included a detailed chemical tagging in our
simulations; this allows us to produce a restriction of the structural
parameters of the spiral arms in the Milky Way as well as a method to constrain
chemical evolution models towards the center of the Galactic disc, where no
chemical model provides information. We also found that it is unlikely that the
Sun was formed near its current galactocentric position, therefore it might be
inaccurate to consider the Sun as representative of the chemical abundances in
the solar neighborhood. We also show that a stellar disc of the Milky Way,
after evolving dynamically and chemically for 5 Gyr, preserves 80% of its
original global metallicity gradient despite having suffered important heating
and radial migration; this means that the presence of a metallicity gradient in
a given galaxy, does not guarantee that radial mixing has not played a role in

a multitude of new structures associated with the mini-halo. The mini-halo
seems to be influenced both by the AGN activity as well as by the sloshing
motion of the cool core cluster's gas. In addition, it has a filamentary
structure similar to that seen in radio relics found in merging clusters. We
present a detailed description of the data reduction and imaging process of the

the first time a detailed comparison of the mini-halo structure with the X-ray
structure as seen in the Chandra X-ray images. The resulting image shows very
clearly that the mini-halo emission is mostly contained behind the cold fronts,
similar to that predicted by simulations of gas sloshing in galaxy clusters.
However, due to the proximity of the Perseus cluster, as well as the quality of
the data at low radio frequencies and at X-ray wavelengths, we also find
evidence of fine structure. This structure includes several radial radio
filaments extending in different directions, a concave radio structure
associated with the southern X-ray bay and sharp edges that correlate with
X-ray edges. Mini-halos are therefore not simply diffuse, uniform radio
sources, but are rather filled with a rich variety of complex structures. These
results illustrate the high-quality images that can be obtained with the new
JVLA at low radio-frequencies, as well as the necessity to obtain deeper,
higher-fidelity radio images of mini-halos and halos in clusters to further
understand their origin.

is $\gtrsim5\times$ within 25 kpc. At $z=0$, the baryonic simulations are
completely devoid of subhalos down to $3\times10^6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ within
$15$ kpc of the MW-mass galaxy, and fewer than 20 surviving subhalos have
orbital pericenters <20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics, the
simple addition of an embedded central disk potential to DMO simulations
reproduces this subhalo depletion, including trends with radius, remarkably
well. Thus, the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary
cause of subhalo depletion. Subhalos on radial orbits that pass close to the
central galaxy are preferentially destroyed, causing the surviving subhalo
population to have tangentially biased orbits compared to DMO predictions. Our
method of embedding a disk potential in DMO simulations provides a fast and
accurate alternative to full baryonic simulations, thus enabling suites of
cosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions
of substructure populations.

Quantum wires with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction and magnetic field
exhibit a partial gap in one-half of the conducting modes. Such systems have
attracted wide-spread experimental and theoretical attention due to their
unusual physical properties, among which are spin-dependent transport, or a
topological superconducting phase when under the proximity effect of an s-wave
superconductor. As a microscopic model for the quantum wire we study an
extended Hubbard model with spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman field. We obtain
spin resolved spectral densities from the real-time evolution of excitations,
and calculate the phase diagram. We find that interactions increase the pseudo
gap at $k = 0$ and thus also enhance the Majorana-supporting phase and
stabilize the helical spin order. Furthermore, we calculate the optical
conductivity and compare it with the low energy spiral Luttinger Liquid result,
obtained from field theoretical calculations. With interactions, the optical
conductivity is dominated by an excotic excitation of a bound
soliton-antisoliton pair known as a breather state. We visualize the
oscillating motion of the breather state, which could provide the route to
their experimental detection in e.g. cold atom experiments.

a system by taking the tertiary mass to zero and solve the hierarchical three

GaAs, by contrast the coherence time is essentially the same for barrier and

qubit operations are performed using a new family of composite pulses that

the best way to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates in singlet-triplet qubits.

star equation of state (EOS) by measuring the tidal deformability of neutron

stiffness of the EOS. We show that causality (the requirement that the speed of
sound is less than the speed of light for a perfect fluid satisfying a
one-parameter equation of state) places an upper bound on tidal deformability
as a function of mass. Like the upper mass limit, the limit on deformabity is
obtained by using an EOS with $v_{sound} = c$ for high densities and matching
to a low density (candidate) EOS at a matching density of order nuclear
saturation density. We use these results and those of [B.D. Lackey et al.,

$4\ M_\odot$ (a match at nuclear saturation density to an unusually stiff

model for the polarization source in 3C 323.1, in which an equatorial absorbing

to be located between the accretion disc and the broad line region. The
scattering/absorbing regions can perhaps be attributed to the accretion disc
wind or flared disc surface, but further polarimetric monitoring observations
for 3C~323.1 and other quasars with continuum-confined polarization are needed
to probe the true physical origins of these regions.

increases with increasing PBH spin. At a fixed $r/r_{\rm isco}$, where $r$ is

to infer total populations from limited observations. Monitoring observations
may give a biassed view of the underlying population due to limitations on
observing time, visibility and instrumental sensitivity. A similar problem
exists in the life sciences, where animal populations (such as migratory birds)
or disease prevalence, must be estimated from sparse and incomplete data. The
class of methods termed Capture-Recapture is used to reconstruct population
estimates from time-series records of encounters with the study population.
This paper investigates the performance of Capture-Recapture methods in
astronomy via a series of numerical simulations. The Blackbirds code simulates
monitoring of populations of transients, in this case accreting binary stars
(neutron star or black hole accreting from a stellar companion) under a range
of observing strategies. We first generate realistic light-curves for
populations of binaries with contrasting orbital period distributions. These
models are then randomly sampled at observing cadences typical of existing and
planned monitoring surveys. The classical capture-recapture methods,
Lincoln-Peterson, Schnabel estimators, related techniques, and newer methods
implemented in the Rcapture package are compared. A general exponential model
based on the radioactive decay law is introduced, and demonstrated to recover
(at 95% confidence) the underlying population abundance and duty cycle, in a
fraction of the observing visits (10-50%) required to discover all the sources
in the simulation. Capture-Recapture is a promising addition to the toolbox of
time domain astronomy, and methods implemented in R by the biostats community
can be readily called from within Python.

near-infrared excess. 24 out of the 53 stars (45% of our sample) are presented
for the first time. A statistical analysis shows four distinctive groups of
polarized post-AGB stars: unpolarized or very lowly polarized (degree of
polarization or DoP < 1%), lowly polarized (1% < DoP < 4%), moderately
polarized (4% < DoP < 8%) and highly polarized (DoP > 8%). 23 out of the 53
(66%) belong to the first group, 10 (19%) to the second, five (9%) to the third
and only three (6%) to the last group.
  Approximately, 34% of our sample was found to be unpolarized objects, which
is close to the percentage of round planetary nebulae. On average, the low and
moderate groups show a wavelength-dependent polarization that increases towards
shorter wavelength, implying an intrinsic origin of the polarization, which
signifies a Rayleigh-like scattering spectrum typical for non-symmetrical
envelopes composed principally of small dust grains. The moderately polarized
stars exhibit higher K-W3 and W1-W3 colour indices compared with the group of
lowly polarized stars suggesting a possible relation between DoP and mass-loss
rate. Moreover, they are found to be systematically colder (redder in B-V),
which may be associated with the condensation process close to these stars that
results in higher degree of polarization. We also provide evidence that
multiple scattering in optically thin polar outflows is the mechanism that
gives high DoP in post-AGB stars with a bipolar or multi-polar envelopes.

structure of the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster via star counts, to clarify
whether it displays a core or a cusp around the central black hole. Through
image stacking and improved PSF fitting we push the completeness limit about
one magnitude deeper than in previous, comparable work. Contrary to previous
work, we analyse the stellar density in well-defined magnitude ranges in order
to be able to constrain stellar masses and ages. The RC and brighter giant
stars display a core-like surface density profile within a projected radius
R<0.3 pc of the central black hole, in agreement with previous studies, but
show a cusp-like surface density distribution at larger R. The surface density
of the fainter stars can be described well by a single power-law at R<2 pc. The
cusp-like profile of the faint stars persists even if we take into account the
possible contamination of stars in this brightness range by young pre-main
sequence stars. The data are inconsistent with a core-profile for the faint
stars.Finally, we show that a 3D Nuker law provides a very good description of
the cluster structure. We conclude that the observed stellar density at the
Galactic Centre, as it can be inferred with current instruments, is consistent
with the existence of a stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole,
Sgr A*. This cusp is well developed inside the influence radius of about 3 pc
of Sgr A* and can be described by a single three-dimensional power-law with an
exponent gamma=1.23+-0.05. The apparent lack of RC stars and brighter giants at
projected distances of R < 0.3 pc (R<8"") of the massive black hole may indicate
that some mechanism has altered their distribution or intrinsic luminosity.

currently accessible through observations around Sagittarius A*. We use
adaptive optics assisted high angular resolution images obtained with the NACO
instrument at the ESO VLT. Through optimised PSF fitting we remove the light
from all detected stars above a given magnitude limit. Subsequently we analyse
the remaining, diffuse light density. The analysed diffuse light arises from
sub-giant and main-sequence stars with KS ~ 19 - 20 with masses of 1 - 2 Msol .
These stars can be old enough to be dynamically relaxed. The observed power-law
profile and its slope are consistent with the existence of a relaxed stellar
cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole. We find that a Nuker law
provides an adequate description of the nuclear cluster's intrinsic shape
(assuming spherical symmetry). The 3D power-law slope near Sgr A* is \gamma =
1.23 +- 0.05. At a distance of 0.01 pc from the black hole, we estimate a
stellar mass density of 2.3 +- 0.3 x 10^7 Msol pc^-3 and a total enclosed
stellar mass of 180 +- 20 Msol. These estimates assume a constant mass-to-light
ratio and do not take stellar remnants into account. The fact that no cusp is
observed for bright (Ks 16) giant stars at projected distances of roughly
0.1-0.3 pc implies that some mechanism has altered their appearance or
distribution.

addressed in stellar dynamics for the last four decades by a number of authors.
Because of its proximity, the centre of the Milky Way is the only observational
test case where the stellar distribution can be accurately tested. Past
observational work indicated that the brightest giants in the Galactic Centre
(GC) may show a density deficit around the central black hole, not a cusp-like
distribution, while we theoretically expect the presence of a stellar cusp. We
here present a solution to this long-standing problem. We performed
direct-summation $N-$body simulations of star clusters around massive black
holes and compared the results of our simulations with new observational data
of the GC's nuclear cluster. We find that after a Hubble time, the distribution
of bright stars as well as the diffuse light follow power-law distributions in
projection with slopes of $\Gamma \approx 0.3$ in our simulations. This is in
excellent agreement with what is seen in star counts and in the distribution of
the diffuse stellar light extracted from adaptive-optics (AO) assisted
near-infrared observations of the GC. Our simulations also confirm that there
exists a missing giant star population within a projected radius of a few
arcsec around Sgr A*. Such a depletion of giant stars in the innermost 0.1 pc
could be explained by a previously present gaseous disc and collisions, which
means that a stellar cusp would also be present at the innermost radii, but in
the form of degenerate compact cores.

star-forming regions from shocks using their [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio and
velocity dispersion. We show that the velocity of star-forming regions agree
with that of the cold gas (HI), particularly, in the tidal tails of the system.
We reconstruct the morphology and kinematics of these tidal tails utilizing an
automated modeling method based on the Identikit software package. We quantify
the goodness of fit and the uncertainties of the derived encounter parameters.
Most of the initial conditions reconstructed using H$\alpha$ and HI are
consistent with each other, and qualitatively agree with the results of
previous works. For example, we find 210$\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs, and
180$\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs for the time since pericenter, when modeling H$\alpha$

kinematics can be used instead of HI kinematics for reconstructing the initial
conditions of galaxy mergers, and our automated modeling method is applicable

high-energy heavy-ion collisions, have recently been applied in small collision
systems such as $pp$ and $p$+A to extract the second-order azimuthal harmonic
flow $v_2$. Recent observation of four-, six- and eight-particle cumulants with
""correct sign"" $c_2\{4\}<0, c_2\{6\}>0, c_2\{8\}<0$ and approximate equality of
the inferred single-particle harmonic flow, $v_2\{4\}\approx v_2\{6\}\approx
v_2\{8\}$, have been used as strong evidence for a collective emission of all
soft particles produced in the collisions. We show that these relations in
principle could be violated due to the non-Gaussianity in the event-by-event
fluctuation of flow and/or non-flow. Furthermore, we show, using $pp$ events
generated with the PYTHIA model, that $c_2\{2k\}$ obtained with standard
cumulant method are dominated by non-flow from dijets. An alternative cumulant
method based on two or more $\eta$-separated subevents is proposed to suppress
the dijet contribution. The new method is shown to be able to recover a flow
signal as low as 4\% imposed on the PYTHIA events, independently of how the
event activity class is defined. Therefore the subevent cumulant method offers
a more robust way of studying collectivity based on the existence of long-range
azimuthal correlations between multiple distinct $\eta$ ranges. The prospect of
using the subevent cumulants to study collective flow in A+A collisions, in
particular its longitudinal dynamics, is discussed.

systems with switching overhead. Such systems consist of a single server that
serves multiple queues, and some capacity is lost whenever the server switches
to serve a different set of queues. The capacity loss due to this switching
overhead can be significant in many emerging applications, and needs to be
explicitly addressed in the design of scheduling policies. For example, in
60GHz wireless networks with directional antennas, base stations need to train
and reconfigure their beam patterns whenever they switch from one client to
another. Considerable switching overhead can also be observed in many other
queueing systems such as transportation networks and manufacturing systems.
While the celebrated Max-Weight policy achieves asymptotically optimal average
delay for systems without switching overhead, it fails to preserve
throughput-optimality, let alone delay-optimality, when switching overhead is
taken into account. We propose a class of Biased Max-Weight scheduling policies
that explicitly takes switching overhead into account. The Biased Max-Weight
policy can use either queue length or head-of-line waiting time as an indicator
of the system status. We prove that our policies not only are
throughput-optimal, but also can be made arbitrarily close to the asymptotic
lower bound on average delay. To validate the performance of the proposed
policies, we provide extensive simulation with various system topologies and
different traffic patterns. We show that the proposed policies indeed achieve
much better delay performance than that of the state-of-the-art policy.

has a unique minimum, if surface tension is sufficient
($\Gamma\equiv\gamma/(a\mu)>\sqrt{32}$) it looses convexity in a finite region.
We use a Maxwell construction to show that, if stretched into this region, the
cylinder will phase separate into two segments with different stretches
$\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. Our model thus explains why the instability has
infinite wavelength, and allows us to calculate the instability's sub-critical
hysteresis loop (as a function of imposed stretch), showing that instability
proceeds with constant amplitude and at constant (positive) tension as the
cylinder is stretched between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. We use full
nonlinear finite-element calculations to verify these predictions, and to
characterize the interface between the two phases. Near $\Gamma=\sqrt{32}$ the

comprise around 230 nuclei, spanning from the $^{8}$He up to $^{150}$La. Apart
from $^{210}$Tl, with a minuscule branching ratio of 0.007\%, no other neutron
emitter is measured yet beyond $A=150$. Therefore new data are needed,
particularly in the heavy mass region around N=126, in order to guide
theoretical models and to understand the formation of the third r-process peak
at $A\sim195$.
  $Purpose:$ To measure both, $\beta$-decay half-lives and neutron branching
ratios of several neutron-rich Au, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi isotopes beyond $N=126$.
  $Method:$ Ions of interest are produced by fragmentation of a $^{238}$U beam,
selected and identified via the GSI-FRS fragment separator. A stack of
segmented silicon detectors (SIMBA) is used to measure ion-implants and
$\beta$-decays. An array of 30 $^3$He tubes embedded in a polyethylene matrix
(BELEN) is used to detect neutrons with high efficiency and selectivity. A
self-triggered digital system is employed to acquire data and to enable
time-correlations. The latter are analyzed with an analytical model and results
for the half-lives and neutron-branching ratios are derived using the binned
Maximum-Likelihood method.
  $Results:$ Twenty new $\beta$-decay half-lives are reported for
$^{204-206}$Au, $^{208-211}$Hg,$^{211-216}$Tl,$^{215-218}$Pb and
$^{218-220}$Bi, nine of them for the first time. Neutron emission probabilities
are reported for $^{210,211}$Hg and $^{211-216}$Tl.
  $Conclusions:$ The new $\beta$-decay half-lives are in good agreement with
previous measurements in this region. The measured neutron emission
probabilities are comparable or smaller than values predicted by global models
like RHB+RQRPA.

all such graphons possess a simple structure, e.g., the space of their typical
vertices is always finite dimensional; this was disproved by several ad hoc
constructions of complex finitely forcible graphons. We prove that any graphon
is a subgraphon of a finitely forcible graphon. This dismisses any hope for a
result showing that finitely forcible graphons possess a simple structure, and
is surprising when contrasted with the fact that finitely forcible graphons
form a meager set in the space of all graphons. In addition, since any finitely
forcible graphon represents the unique minimizer of some linear combination of
densities of subgraphs, our result also shows that such minimization problems,
which conceptually are among the simplest kind within extremal graph theory,
may in fact have unique optimal solutions with arbitrarily complex structure.

principal results are simple with a wide range of applications. The region of
attraction to the stable anisotropic fixed point in the quantum-critical region
is exponentially enhanced by the dynamical critical exponent $z$ compared to
the region of attraction to the fixed point in the quantum disordered region.
The result implies that, even for small anisotropy, the region of attraction to
the stable incommensurate Ising or planar metallic anti-ferromagnetic critical
points, which belong to the universality class of the XY model with $z \to
\infty$, covers the entire quantum-critical region. In crossovers due to
disorder, the instability of the pure fixed point in the quantum disordered

this, we carry out N-body simulations with three Jupiter-mass planets close to

focuses on the analysis of systems in which a single Jupiter-mass planet
survives after the dynamical instability event. The small body reservoirs show
different dynamical behaviors. In fact, our simulations produce particles on
prograde and retrograde orbits, as well as particles whose orbital plane flips
from prograde to retrograde and back again along their evolution. Such
particles are called ""Type-F particles"". We find strong correlations between
the inclination $i$ and the ascending node longitude $\Omega$ of such
particles. First, $\Omega$ librates around 90$^{\circ}$ or/and 270$^{\circ}$.
This property is very important since it represents a necessary and sufficient
condition for the flipping of an orbit. Moreover, the libration periods of $i$
and $\Omega$ are equal and they are out to phase by a quarter period. We also
remark that the larger the libration amplitude of $i$, the larger the libration
amplitude of $\Omega$. Finally, we analyze the initial conditions of Type-F
particles of all our simulations immediately after the dynamical instability
event, when a single Jupiter-mass planet survives in the system. We carry out
this study with the goal to determine the parameter space that lead to the
flipping of an orbit. Our results suggest that the orbit of a test particle can
flip for any value of its initial eccentricity, although we found only two
Type-F particles with initial inclinations $i <$ 17$^{\circ}$. Moreover, our
study indicates that the minimum value of the inclination of the Type-F

back-propagating through a long chain of tied weight matrices. The length of
this chain scales linearly with the number of time-steps as the same network is
run at each time-step. This creates many problems, such as vanishing gradients,
that have been well studied. In contrast, a NNEM's architecture recurrent
activity doesn't involve a long chain of activity (though some architectures
such as the NTM do utilize a traditional recurrent architecture as a
controller). Rather, the externally stored embedding vectors are used at each
time-step, but no messages are passed from previous time-steps. This means that
vanishing gradients aren't a problem, as all of the necessary gradient paths
are short. However, these paths are extremely numerous (one per embedding
vector in memory) and reused for a very long time (until it leaves the memory).
Thus, the forward-pass information of each memory must be stored for the entire
duration of the memory. This is problematic as this additional storage far
surpasses that of the actual memories, to the extent that large memories on
infeasible to back-propagate through in high dimensional settings. One way to
get around the need to hold onto forward-pass information is to recalculate the
forward-pass whenever gradient information is available. However, if the
observations are too large to store in the domain of interest, direct
reinstatement of a forward pass cannot occur. Instead, we rely on a learned
autoencoder to reinstate the observation, and then use the embedding network to
recalculate the forward-pass. Since the recalculated embedding vector is
unlikely to perfectly match the one stored in memory, we try out 2
approximations to utilize error gradient w.r.t. the vector in memory.

research into general artificial intelligence. While the idea of
domain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to
terms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure
of the tasks humans perform. The position of this article is that only by
aligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we
stand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI). A broad
reading of the famous 'No Free Lunch' theorem is that there is no universally
optimal inductive bias or, equivalently, bias-free learning is impossible. This
follows from the fact that there are an infinite number of ways to extrapolate
data, any of which might be the one used by the data generating environment; an
inductive bias prefers some of these extrapolations to others, which lowers
performance in environments using these adversarial extrapolations. We may
posit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of
its environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this
agent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative
environments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment
as being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is
obviously irrelevant. But, we should expect a sharper inductive bias if we
further constrain our environment. Indeed, we implicitly do so by defining GAI
in terms of accomplishing that humans consider useful. One common version of
this is need the for 'common-sense reasoning', which implicitly appeals to the
statistics of physical universe as perceived by humans.

analyze tensor time series with Linear Dynamical System (LDS) which is the most
common for encoding spatio-temporal time-series data in various disciplines dut
to its relative simplicity and efficiency. However, the traditional LDS treats
the latent and observation state at each frame of video as a column vector.
Such a vector representation fails to take into account the curse of
dimensionality as well as valuable structural information with human action.
Considering this fact, we propose generalized Linear Dynamical System (gLDS)
for modeling tensor observation in the time series and employ Tucker
decomposition to estimate the LDS parameters as action descriptors. Therefore,
an action can be represented as a subspace corresponding to a point on a
Grassmann manifold. Then we perform classification using dictionary learning
and sparse coding over Grassmann manifold. Experiments on MSR Action3D Dataset,
UCF Kinect Dataset and Northwestern-UCLA Multiview Action3D Dataset demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art
algorithms.

these can be utilized to substantially reduce MPS computation costs. It is
conceptually straightforward to simulate canonical ensembles using symmetric

this purpose, we introduce symmetric Fourier and Haar-random block bases that

and have poor performance for off-grid targets. This paper develops a general
estimation scheme in the sense that it is applicable to all AICs regardless
whether the targets are on or off the grids. The proposed scheme estimates the
delay and Doppler parameters sequentially, in which the delay estimation is
formulated into a beamspace direction-of- arrival problem and the Doppler
estimation is translated into a line spectrum estimation problem. Then the
well-known spatial and temporal spectrum estimation techniques are used to
provide efficient and high-resolution estimates of the delay and Doppler
parameters. In addition, sufficient conditions on the AIC to guarantee the
successful estimation of off-grid targets are provided, while the existing
conditions are mostly related to the on-grid targets. Theoretical analyses and
numerical experiments show the effectiveness and the correctness of the
proposed scheme.

find that interfacing a WSe2 monolayer with materials such as SiO2, sapphire,

amplified by nearly two orders of magnitude when a foreign phonon mode is
resonantly coupled to the A exciton in WSe2 directly, or via an A'1 optical
phonon from WSe2. We further showed that the interfacial Raman scattering is
distinct between hBN-encapsulated and hBN-sandwiched WSe2 sample geometries.

  Speech and Signal Processing",,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The promise of compressive sensing (CS) has been offset by two significant
challenges. First, real-world data is not exactly sparse in a fixed basis.
Second, current high-performance recovery algorithms are slow to converge,
which limits CS to either non-real-time applications or scenarios where massive
back-end computing is available. In this paper, we attack both of these
challenges head-on by developing a new signal recovery framework we call {\em
DeepInverse} that learns the inverse transformation from measurement vectors to
signals using a {\em deep convolutional network}. When trained on a set of
representative images, the network learns both a representation for the signals
(addressing challenge one) and an inverse map approximating a greedy or convex
recovery algorithm (addressing challenge two). Our experiments indicate that
the DeepInverse network closely approximates the solution produced by
state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms yet is hundreds of times faster in run
time. The tradeoff for the ultrafast run time is a computationally intensive,
off-line training procedure typical to deep networks. However, the training
needs to be completed only once, which makes the approach attractive for a host
of sparse recovery problems.

data services for future Internet of things (IoT)-based network systems. It
relies on a set of low-power fog nodes that are close to the end users to
offload the services originally targeting at cloud data centers. In this paper,
we consider a specific fog computing network consisting of a set of data
service operators (DSOs) each of which controls a set of fog nodes to provide
the required data service to a set of data service subscribers (DSSs). How to
allocate the limited computing resources of fog nodes (FNs) to all the DSSs to
achieve an optimal and stable performance is an important problem. In this
paper, we propose a joint optimization framework for all FNs, DSOs and DSSs to
achieve the optimal resource allocation schemes in a distributed fashion. In
the framework, we first formulate a Stackelberg game to analyze the pricing
problem for the DSOs as well as the resource allocation problem for the DSSs.
Under the scenarios that the DSOs can know the expected amount of resource
purchased by the DSSs, a many-to-many matching game is applied to investigate
the pairing problem between DSOs and FNs. Finally, within the same DSO, we
apply another layer of many-to-many matching between each of the paired FNs and
serving DSSs to solve the FN-DSS pairing problem. Simulation results show that
our proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of the
IoT-based network systems.

study DM, as its accumulation in a star can enhance energy transport, by
providing a conduction mechanism, producing significant changes in the stellar
structure during the course of the star's evolution. The stellar core,
particularly affected by the presence of DM, can be investigated through
precise asteroseismic diagnostics. We modelled three stars including DM energy
transport: the Sun, a slightly less massive and much older star, KIC 7871531

one, KIC 8379927 ($1.12 \, M_{\odot}$, $1.82 \, \text{Gyr}$). We considered
both the case of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles, albeit with a low

particles in the star can be much greater. By analysing these models with
asteroseismic separation ratios weighted towards the core, we found indications
limiting the effective spin-dependent DM-proton coupling for masses of a few

al. (Adv Eng Mat 12(5), 389-397, 2010) to show a mechanism for a bistable

shows, at least for intermediate levels of stickiness, that external pressure
can switch the system into a ""strong adhesive"" regime of full contact, or into
weak adhesion and complete pull-off, similarly to the contact of surfaces with
a single scale of periodical waviness. We add to this model the effect of
roughness, in the simple form of axisymmetric single scale of waviness,
permitting a very detailed study, and we show that this induces a resistance to
jumping into full contact on one hand (limiting the ""strong adhesion"" regime),
and an enhancement of pull-off and of hysteresis starting from the partial
contact state on the other (enhancing the ""weak adhesion"" regime). We show the
system depends only on two dimensionless parameters, depending on the ratio of
work of adhesion to the energy to flatten the dimple or waviness, respectively.
The system becomes pressure-sensitive also in the intermediate states, as it is
observed in real adhesive rough systems. The model obviously is specular to the
Guduru model of rough spheres (Guduru, JMPS, 55, 473--488, 2007), with which it
shares the limitations of the analysis assuming a connected contact (crack)

data reliability of the data sample and the influence of outliers exerted on
classical principal component analysis, robust principal component analysis
(ROBPCA) is employed in order to reveal the explanatory variables responsible
for most of the variability. Interpretation of the results is eased by
utilizing ROSPCA. The application of ROSPCA reveals six distinct principal
components where each is determined by a few variables. Among others, our
results suggest a key role of variable categories such as journey
purpose-related impedance and journey inherent constraints. Surprisingly, the
variables associated with journey timing turn out to be less important.
Finally, our findings reveal the critical role of outliers in travel behavior
analysis. This suggests that a systematic understanding of how outliers
contribute to observed mobility behavior patterns, as derived from travel
surveys, is needed. In this regard, the proposed methods serve for processing
raw data typically used in activity-based modelling.

modified gravity can be understood as generated by the addition of a
3-dimensional algebraic manifold to an initial 11-dimensional space-time
manifold; this builds up an 11+3-dimensional space-time. In this system,
firstly, some fields living in the bulk join the fields that live on the
11-dimensional manifold, so that the rank of the gauge fields exceeds the
dimension of the algebra; consequently, there emerges an anomaly. To solve this
problem, another 11-dimensional manifold is included in the 11 +3-dimensional
space-time, and it interacts with the initial manifold by exchanging
Chern-Simons fields. This mechanism is able to remove the anomaly. Chern-Simons
terms actually produce an extra manifold between the pair of 11-dimensional
manifolds of the 11+3-space-time. Summing up over the topology of both the
11-dimensional manifolds and the topology of the exchanged Chern-Simons
manifold in the bulk , we conclude that the total topology shrinks to one,
which is in agreement with the main idea of the Big Bang theory.

This paper aims to create a more thorough understanding of the strengths and

implementing more computationally costly algorithms, such as A-Projection, and
when simpler, quicker algorithms will suffice. We quantify our results by

that for dynamic ranges of less than 1000, for point sources and sources much
smaller than the main lobe of the primary beam, the accuracy of the primary
beam model beyond the physical size of the aperture simply doesn't matter. In
observations of large extended sources, deconvolution errors dominate the

indistinguishable from each other.

constraints in embedded systems and hand-held devices. In this work we target
the ARM big.LITTLE, a heterogeneous platform that is dominant in the mobile and
embedded market, which allows code to run transparently on different
microarchitectures with individual energy and performance characteristics. It
allows to se more energy efficient cores to conserve power during simple tasks
and idle times and switch over to faster, more power hungry cores when
performance is needed. This proposal explores the power-savings and the
performance gains that can be achieved by utilizing the ARM big.LITTLE core in
combination with Decoupled Access-Execute (DAE). DAE is a compiler technique
that splits code regions into two distinct phases: a memory-bound Access phase
and a compute-bound Execute phase. By scheduling the memory-bound phase on the
LITTLE core, and the compute-bound phase on the big core, we conserve energy
while caching data from main memory and perform computations at maximum
performance. Our preliminary findings show that applying DAE on ARM big.LITTLE
has potential. By prefetching data in Access we can achieve an IPC improvement
of up to 37% in the Execute phase, and manage to shift more than half of the
program runtime to the LITTLE core. We also provide insight into advantages and
disadvantages of our approach, present preliminary results and discuss
potential solutions to overcome locking overhead.

flexural stiffness of an Euler Bernoulli beam in order to reconstruct its
profile starting from available response data. The proposed identification
procedure makes use of energy measurements and is based on the application of a
closed form solution for the static displacements of multi-stepped beams. This
solution allows to easily calculate the energy related to beams modeled with
arbitrary multi-step shapes subjected to a transversal roving force, and to
compare it with the correspondent data obtained through direct measurements on
real beams. The optimal solution which minimizes the difference between
measured and calculated data is then sought by means of genetic algorithms. In
the paper several different stepped beams are investigated showing that the
proposed procedure allows in many cases to identify the exact beam profile.
However it is shown that in some other cases different multi-step profiles may
correspond to very similar static responses, and therefore to comparable minima
in the optimization problem, thus complicating the profile identification
problem.

interaction between hardware and software. For software developers without an
in-depth background in computer architecture, understanding and fully utilizing
modern architectures is close to impossible. Analytic loop performance modeling
is a useful way to understand the relevant bottlenecks of code execution based
on simple machine models. The Roofline Model and the Execution-Cache-Memory
(ECM) model are proven approaches to performance modeling of loop nests. In
comparison to the Roofline model, the ECM model can also describes the
single-core performance and saturation behavior on a multicore chip. We give an
introduction to the Roofline and ECM models, and to stencil performance
modeling using layer conditions (LC). We then present Kerncraft, a tool that
can automatically construct Roofline and ECM models for loop nests by
performing the required code, data transfer, and LC analysis. The layer
condition analysis allows to predict optimal spatial blocking factors for loop
nests. Together with the models it enables an ab-initio estimate of the
potential benefits of loop blocking optimizations and of useful block sizes. In
cases where LC analysis is not easily possible, Kerncraft supports a cache
simulator as a fallback option. Using a 25-point long-range stencil we
demonstrate the usefulness and predictive power of the Kerncraft tool.
