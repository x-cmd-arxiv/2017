Seyfert 2 galaxies selected from the Swift-BAT 100-month catalog. We selected
nearby (z<=0.03) sources lacking of a ROSAT counterpart and never previously
observed with Chandra in the 0.3-10 keV energy range, and targeted these
objects with 10 ks Chandra ACIS-S observations. The X-ray spectral fitting over
the 0.3-150 keV energy range allows us to determine that all the objects are
significantly obscured, having NH>=1E23 cm^(-2) at a >99% confidence level.
Moreover, one to three sources are candidate Compton thick Active Galactic
Nuclei (CT-AGN), i.e., have NH>=1E24 cm^(-2). We also test the recent ""spectral
curvature"" method developed by Koss et al. (2016) to find candidate CT-AGN,
finding a good agreement between our results and their predictions. Since the
selection criteria we adopted have been effective in detecting highly obscured
AGN, further observations of these and other Seyfert 2 galaxies selected from
the Swift-BAT 100-month catalog will allow us to create a statistically
significant sample of highly obscured AGN, therefore better understanding the
physics of the obscuration processes.

Under fairly general circumstances, our technique is capable of recovering the
majority of ether lost from theft with high probability even when all of the

of dark energy based on the requirement that cosmological structure forms
before being frozen out by the eventual acceleration of the universe. By
allowing for variations in both the cosmological parameters and the strength of
gravity, the resulting constraint is a generalization of previous limits. The
specific parameters under consideration include the amplitude $Q$ of the
primordial density fluctuations, the Planck mass $M_{\rm pl}$, the
baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, and the density ratio $\Omega_M/\Omega_b$. In
addition to structure formation, we use considerations from stellar structure
and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to constrain these quantities. The resulting
upper limit on the dimensionless density of dark energy becomes
$\rho_{\scriptstyle\Lambda}/M_{\rm pl}^4<10^{-90}$, which is $\sim30$ orders of
magnitude larger than the value in our universe
$\rho_{\scriptstyle\Lambda}/M_{\rm pl}^4\sim10^{-120}$. This new limit is much
less restrictive than previous constraints because additional parameters are
allowed to vary. With these generalizations, a much wider range of universes
can develop cosmic structure and support observers. To constrain the
constituent parameters, new BBN calculations are carried out in the regime
where $\eta$ and $G=M_{\rm pl}^{-2}$ are much larger than in our universe. If
the BBN epoch were to process all of the protons into heavier elements, no
hydrogen would be left behind to make water, and the universe would not be
viable. However, our results show that some hydrogen is always left over, even
under conditions of extremely large $\eta$ and $G$, so that a wide range of
alternate universes are potentially habitable.

stochastic optimization problems defined over multiagent networks. Considering
that communication is a major bottleneck in decentralized optimization, our
main goal in this paper is to develop algorithmic frameworks which can
significantly reduce the number of inter-node communications. We first propose
a decentralized primal-dual method which can find an $\epsilon$-solution both
in terms of functional optimality gap and feasibility residual in
$O(1/\epsilon)$ inter-node communication rounds when the objective functions
are convex and the local primal subproblems are solved exactly. Our major
contribution is to present a new class of decentralized primal-dual type
algorithms, namely the decentralized communication sliding (DCS) methods, which
can skip the inter-node communications while agents solve the primal
subproblems iteratively through linearizations of their local objective
functions. By employing DCS, agents can still find an $\epsilon$-solution in
$O(1/\epsilon)$ (resp., $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$) communication rounds for
general convex functions (resp., strongly convex functions), while maintaining
the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ (resp., $O(1/\epsilon)$) bound on the total number of
intra-node subgradient evaluations. We also present a stochastic counterpart
for these algorithms, denoted by SDCS, for solving stochastic optimization
problems whose objective function cannot be evaluated exactly. In comparison
with existing results for decentralized nonsmooth and stochastic optimization,
we can reduce the total number of inter-node communication rounds by orders of
magnitude while still maintaining the optimal complexity bounds on intra-node
stochastic subgradient evaluations. The bounds on the subgradient evaluations
are actually comparable to those required for centralized nonsmooth and

between the cosmological constant and the scale factor of the scale invariant

equations for cosmology, which now contain a new term, depending on the
derivative of the scale factor, that opposes to gravity and produces an
accelerated expansion. The displacements due to the acceleration term make a
high contribution Omega_l to the energy-density of the Universe, satisfying an
equation of the form Omega_m+\Omega_k+Omega_l = 1. The models do not demand the
existence of unknown particles. There is a family of flat models with different
density parameters Omega_m < 1.
  Numerical integrations of the cosmological equations for different values of
the curvature and density parameter k and Omega_m are performed. The presence
of even tiny amounts of matter in the Universe tends to kill scale invariance.
The point is that for Omega_m = 0.3 the effect is not yet completely killed.
The models with non-zero density start explosively with first a braking phase
followed by a continuously accelerating expansion. Several observational
properties are examined, in particular the distances, the m--z diagram, the
Omega_m vs. lambda plot. Comparisons with observations are also performed for
the Hubble constant H_0 vs. Omega_m, for the expansion history in the plot
H(z)/(z+1) vs. redshift z and for the transition redshift from braking to
acceleration. These first dynamical tests are satisfied by the scale invariant

coincide for free, ergodic actions of any countable group. Finally, we consider
actions of non-Abelian free groups and demonstrate the geometric significance

paper deals with online convex optimization involving adversarial loss
functions and adversarial constraints, where the constraints are revealed after

to simultaneously yield sub-linear dynamic regret and fit, provided that the
accumulated variations of per-slot minimizers and constraints are sub-linearly
growing with time. MOSP is also applied to the dynamic network resource

the cold atom context---are associated with synthetic gauge fields, can
significantly and non-trivially modify the phase accumulation at small
interparticle distances even if the length scale $(k_{\text{so}})^{-1}$
associated with the spin-orbit coupling term is significantly larger than the
van der Waals length $r_{\text{vdW}}$ that characterizes the two-body
interaction potential. A theoretical framework, which utilizes a generalized
local frame transformation and accounts for the phase accumulation
analytically, is developed. Comparison with numerical coupled-channels
calculations demonstrates that the phase accumulation can, to a very good
approximation, be described over a wide range of energies by the free-space
scattering phase shifts---evaluated at a scattering energy that depends on
$k_{\text{so}}$---and the spin-orbit coupling strength $k_{\text{so}}$.

dynamic declaration of network structure. In the static declaration strategy
that is used in toolkits like Theano, CNTK, and TensorFlow, the user first
defines a computation graph (a symbolic representation of the computation), and
then examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and
computes its derivatives. In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy, computation
graph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by
executing procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is
free to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration
thus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures,
and DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in
a way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or
Python). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic
computation graph is defined anew for every training example, its construction
must have low overhead. To achieve this, DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and
lightweight graph representation. Experiments show that DyNet's speeds are
faster than or comparable with static declaration toolkits, and significantly
faster than Chainer, another dynamic declaration toolkit. DyNet is released

(VR) has been already validated as effective, safe, affordable and motivating

more intuitive real-world user interface, thereby facilitating a more seamless

BCI systems and may help to compensate for their low bandwidth. In this
feasibility study, three healthy participants had to finish a complex
navigation task in immersive VR and AR conditions using an online SSVEP BCI.
Two out of three subjects were successful in all conditions. To our knowledge,
this is the first work to present an SSVEP BCI that operates using target

This research direction can benefit patients by introducing more intuitive and

can also be caused by another mechanism, the spin-conserving scattering in the
presence of spin accumulation gradient, in addition to the well-known spin-flip

the spin-dependent heat generation is dominated by the spin-flip scattering in
the antiparallel configuration, and by the spin-conserving scattering in the

alternative so that the heat generation can still be described simply by

iterative methods is limited by global synchronization. This has inspired the
development of $s$-step Krylov subspace method variants, in which iterations
are computed in blocks of $s$, which can reduce the number of global
synchronizations per iteration by a factor of $O(s)$.
  Although the $s$-step variants are mathematically equivalent to their
classical counterparts, they can behave quite differently in finite precision
depending on the parameter $s$. If $s$ is chosen too large, the $s$-step method
can suffer a convergence delay and a decrease in attainable accuracy relative
to the classical method. This makes it difficult for a potential user of such
methods - the $s$ value that minimizes the time per iteration may not be the
best $s$ for minimizing the overall time-to-solution, and further may cause an
unacceptable decrease in accuracy.
  Towards improving the reliability and usability of $s$-step Krylov subspace
methods, in this work we derive the \emph{adaptive $s$-step CG method}, a
variable $s$-step CG method where in block $k$, the parameter $s_k$ is
determined automatically such that a user-specified accuracy is attainable. The
method for determining $s_k$ is based on a bound on growth of the residual gap
within block $k$, from which we derive a constraint on the condition numbers of
the computed $O(s_k)$-dimensional Krylov subspace bases. The computations
required for determining the block size $s_k$ can be performed without
increasing the number of global synchronizations per block. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate that the adaptive $s$-step CG method is able to attain
up to the same accuracy as classical CG while still significantly reducing the
total number of global synchronizations.

problems involving discontinuities with no or minimal remeshing through
appropriate enrichment functions. This enables elements to be split by a
discontinuity, strong or weak and hence requires the integration of
discontinuous functions or functions with discontinuous derivatives over
elementary volumes. Moreover, in the case of open surfaces and singularities,
special, usually non-polynomial functions must also be integrated. A variety of
approaches have been proposed to facilitate these special types of numerical
integration, which have been shown to have a large impact on the accuracy and
the convergence of the numerical solution. The smoothed extended finite element
method (SmXFEM) [1], for example, makes numerical integration elegant and
simple by transforming volume integrals into surface integrals. However, it was
reported in [1, 2] that the strain smoothing is inaccurate when non-polynomial
functions are in the basis. This is due to the constant smoothing function used
over the smoothing domains which destroys the effect of the singularity. In
this paper, we investigate the benefits of a recently developed Linear
smoothing procedure [3] which provides better approximation to higher order
polynomial fields in the basis. Some benchmark problems in the context of
linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are solved to compare the standard
XFEM, the constant-smoothed XFEM (Sm-XFEM) and the linear-smoothed XFEM
(LSm-XFEM). We observe that the convergence rates of all three methods are the
same. The stress intensity factors (SIFs) computed through the proposed
LSm-XFEM are however more accurate than that obtained through Sm-XFEM. To
conclude, compared to the conventional XFEM, the same order of accuracy is

two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is demonstrated that the

distance and lead to a better beam quality with a dense density $\geq10n_c$,
monoenergetic peak energy $E_k \sim 1.51~\mathrm{GeV}$, spatial emittance
$\sim0.0088~\mathrm{mm}~\mathrm{mrad}$ with divergence angle $\theta \sim
1.0^{\circ}$ and diameter $\sim 0.5\mathrm{\mu m}$. The enhancement is mainly
attributed to the focusing effect by the transverse electric field generated by
the cone as well as the capillary, which can prevent greatly the protons from
expanding in the transverse direction. Comparable to without the capillary, the
protons energy spectra have a stable monoenergetic peak and divergence angle
near to $1.0^{\circ}$ in longer time. Besides, the efficiency of acceleration
depending on the capillary length is explored, and the optimal capillary length
is also achieved. Such a target may be benefit to many applications such as
ions fast ignition in inertial fusion, proton therapy in medicine and so on.

$R_{\rm{eff}}$ is proportional on average to halo $R_{200c}$, confirming and
extending to high redshifts the $z=0$ results of Kravtsov. Late-type galaxies

linear $R_{\rm{eff}}$--$R_{200c}$ relation, with effective radii at $0.5 < z <

the sizes of late-type galaxies appear to be slightly below this prediction.
Early-type galaxies (with high S\'ersic index and low sSFR) follow a roughly
parallel $R_{\rm{eff}}$--$R_{200c}$ relation, $\sim$ 0.2--0.3 dex below the one
for late-type galaxies. Our observational results, reinforced by recent

detection is a big step in saving the life of any patient. Mammography is a
common tool in breast cancer diagnosis. The most important step here is
classification of mammogram patches as normal-abnormal and benign-malignant.
  Texture of a breast in a mammogram patch plays a significant role in these
classifications. We propose a variation of Histogram of Gradients (HOG) and
Gabor filter combination called Histogram of Oriented Texture (HOT) that
exploits this fact. We also revisit the Pass Band - Discrete Cosine Transform

mammogram patch may not be useful. Hence, we apply a feature selection
technique called Discrimination Potentiality (DP). Our resulting descriptors,
DP-HOT and DP-PB-DCT, are compared with the standard descriptors.
  Density of a mammogram patch is important for classification, and has not
been studied exhaustively. The Image Retrieval in Medical Application (IRMA)
database from RWTH Aachen, Germany is a standard database that provides
mammogram patches, and most researchers have tested their frameworks only on a
subset of patches from this database. We apply our two new descriptors on all

standard descriptors (more than 92%).

whole concentration range of $x \in [0 \div 0.9]$. Three different states of
the magnetic structure have been found: a short-periodic helical state at $x
\leq 0.45$, a long-periodic helical state at $0.45 < x \leq 0.8$, and a
ferromagnetic state at $x \sim 0.9$. Taking into account that the relatively
large helical wavevector $k \gg 1$ nm$^{-1}$ is characteristic for systems with
mainly Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction, we suggest that the
short-periodic helical structure at $x \leq 0.45$ is based on an effective RKKY
interaction. Also the decay of $k$ with increasing $x$ is ascribed to a
reduction of the interaction between second nearest neighbors and, therefore,
to an increase of the influence of the Dzyaloshinskiy-Moriya interaction (DMI).
As a result of the competition between these two interactions the quantum phase
transition from a long-range ordered (LRO) to a short-range ordered (SRO)
helical structure has been observed upon increase of the Co-concentration at
$x_{c1} \sim 0.25$. Further increase of $x$ leads to the appearance of a double
peak in the scattering profile at $0.45 < x < 0.7$. The transition from a
helical structure to a ferromagnetic state found at $x = 0.9$ is caused by the
weakening of DMI as compared to the cubic anisotropy. In summary, the evolution
of the magnetic structure of Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Ge with increasing $x$ is an
example of a continuous transition from a helical structure based on the
effective RKKY interaction to a ferromagnetic structure passing through a
helical structure based on DMI.

fundamental concepts of quantum physics by means of a simple and pedagogical
example. An appreciable part of its content presents original results. We start
with the Euclidean plane which is certainly a paradigmatic example of a Hilbert
space. The pure states form the unit circle (actually a half of it), the mixed
states form the unit disk (actually a half of it), and rotations in the plane
rule time evolution through Majorana-like equations involving only real
quantities for closed and open systems. The set of pure states or a set of
mixed states solve the identity and they are used for understanding the concept
of integral quantization of functions on the unit circle and to give a
semi-classical portrait of quantum observables. Interesting probabilistic
aspects are developed. Since the tensor product of two planes, their direct
sum, their cartesian product, are isomorphic (2 is the unique solution to x^x=
x\times x = x+x), and they are also isomorphic to C^2, and to the quaternion
field H (as a vector space), we describe an interesting relation between
entanglement of real states, one-half spin cat states, and unit-norm
quaternions which form the group SU$(2)$. We explain the most general form of
the Hamiltonian in the real plane by considering the integral quantization of a
magnetic-like interaction potential viewed as a classical observable on the
unit $2$-sphere. Finally, we present an example of quantum measurement with
pointer states lying also in the Euclidean plane.

that can be derived from the analysis of the subsequent parity-violating
$\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ decay: the differential branching fraction ${\rm d}{\cal

This problem is overcomed using the clustering algorithm. When the system has
two symmetric states of positive and negative magnetization, the parameter
reconstruction can be also obtained with smaller computational effort simply by
flipping the sign of the magnetizations from positive to negative (or

  Transition Path in Non-gradient Systems","25 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The minimum action method (MAM) is to calculate the most probable transition
path in randomly perturbed stochastic dynamics, based on the idea of action
minimization in the path space. The accuracy of the numerical path between
different metastable states usually suffers from the ""clustering problem"" near
fixed points. The adaptive minimum action method (aMAM) solves this problem by
relocating image points equally along arc-length with the help of moving mesh
strategy. However, when the time interval is large, the images on the path may
still be locally trapped around the transition state in a tangle, due to the
singularity of the relationship between arc-length and time at the transition
state. Additionally, in most non-gradient dynamics, the tangent direction of
the path is not continuous at the transition state so that a geometric corner
forms, which brings extra challenges for the aMAM. In this note, we improve the
aMAM by proposing a better monitor function that does not contain the numerical
approximation of derivatives, and taking use of a generalized scheme of the
Euler-Lagrange equation to solve the minimization problem, so that both the
path-tangling problem and the non-smoothness in parametrizing the curve do not
exist. To further improve the accuracy, we apply the Weighted Essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) method for the interpolation to achieve better
performance. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of
our new method.

prove finite-time singularity formation from smooth initial data for the

consequence, we have finite-time singularity for certain infinite-energy

$C^\alpha$-regular. One of the difficulties in the models we consider is that
there are competing \emph{nonlocal} stabilizing effects (advection) and
destabilizing effects (vortex stretching) which are of the same size in terms
of scaling. Hence, it is difficult to establish the domination of one effect
over the other without having strong control of the solution.
  We conjecture that strong solutions to the De Gregorio model exhibit the
following behavior: for each $0<\alpha<1$ there exists an initial $\omega_0\in
C^\alpha(\mathbb{R})$ which is compactly supported for which the solution
becomes singular in finite-time; on the other hand, solutions to De Gregorio's

cannot be explained merely by scaling considerations since $C^\alpha$ spaces
are scaling subcritical for each $\alpha>0$.

hydrodynamic structures that are observed close to the collision boundary of
energetic astrophysical outflows. It develops in nonplanar shells that are
bounded on either side by a hydrodynamic shock, provided that the amplitude of
the seed oscillations is sufficiently large. The hydrodynamic NTSI has a
microscopic counterpart in collisionless plasma. A sinusoidal displacement of a
thin shell, which is formed by the collision of two clouds of unmagnetized
electrons and protons, grows and saturates on timescales of the order of the
inverse proton plasma frequency. Here we increase the wavelength of the seed
perturbation by a factor 4 compared to that in a previous study. Like in the
case of the hydrodynamic NTSI, the increase in the wavelength reduces the
growth rate of the microscopic NTSI. The prolonged growth time of the
microscopic NTSI allows the waves, which are driven by the competing ion
acoustic instability, to grow to a large amplitude before the NTSI saturates
and they disrupt the latter. The ion acoustic instability thus imposes a limit
on the largest wavelength that can be destabilized by the NTSI in collisionless
plasma. The limit can be overcome by binary collisions. We bring forward
evidence for an overstability of the collisionless NTSI.

received channel output back to the transmitters via two noiseless channels,
respectively. This model is called the MAC-WT with noiseless feedback. Inner

bound on the secrecy capacity region of this feedback model, and this bound is
constructed by allowing each transmitter to decode the other one's transmitted
message from the feedback, and then each transmitter uses the decoded message
to re-encode his own messages, i.e., this DF inner bound allows the independent
transmitters to co-operate with each other. Then, we provide a hybrid inner
bound which is strictly larger than the DF inner bound, and it is constructed
by using the feedback as a tool not only to allow the independent transmitters
to co-operate with each other, but also to generate two secret keys
respectively shared between the legitimate receiver and the two transmitters.
Finally, we give a sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of this

the density of eccentricity are located at eccentricity = 0.25, 0.75, and 0.95,
with relative weights 0.79, 0.10, and 0.11. Future RV observations will clarify
which of the three chimeras represents the true eccentricity of Proxima b. The
most-likely estimate is eccentricity = 0.25, and our lower limit is
eccentricity = 0.025. Our strategic, long-term goal is to elevate the orbital
analyses of exoplanets to meet the challenges of sometimes complex probability
density distributions.

properties, to each of them a scaling function is assigned, characterized by c
and d for first and second scaling property, respectively, is formulated in a
grand-canonical ensemble with finite volume in the thermodynamic limit. The
thermodynamic properties of a relativistic ideal gas of hadron resonances are
studied. It is found that this generic statistics satisfies the requirements of
the equilibrium thermodynamics. Essential aspects of thermodynamic
self-consistency are clarified. Analytical expressions are proposed for the
statistical fits of various transverse momentum distributions measured in
most-central collisions at different collision energies and colliding systems.
Estimations for the freezeout temperature and chemical potential and both c and
d are determined. The earlier are found compatible with the parameters deduced
from Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics (extensive), while the latter refer to
generic nonextensivity. The resulting equivalence class (c,d) is associated to
stretched exponentials, where Lambert function reaches its asymptotic
stability. In some measurements, the resulting nonextensive entropy is linearly
composed of extensive entropies. Apart from power-scaling, the particle ratios
and yields are excellent quantities to highlighting whether the particle
production takes place, (non)extensively. Various particle ratios and yields
measured by the STAR experiment in central collisions at 200, 62.4 and 7.7 GeV
are fitted to this novel approach. We found that both c and d<1, i.e. referring
to neither BG- nor Tsallis-type statistics, but to (c,d)-entropy, where Lambert
functions exponentially raise. We conclude that the particle production at STAR
energies is likely a nonextensive process but not necessarily BG or Tsallis
type.

Mechanics (CM) is by a complete change of the general methodology) despite QM
historically stemming from CM as a means to explain experimental results.
Therefore, it is desirable to build a bridge from CM to QM.
  This paper presents a generalization of CM to QM. It starts from the
generalization of a point-like object and naturally arrives at the quantum
state vector of quantum systems in the complex valued Hilbert space, its time
evolution and quantum representation of a measurement apparatus of any size.
Each time, when generalization is performed, there is a possibility to develop
new theory giving up most simple generalizations. It is shown that a
measurement apparatus is a special case of a general quantum object. An example
of a measurement apparatus of an intermediate size is considered in the end.

closely related properties. There is consensus in considering resolution as the
density of elementary pieces of information in a specified information space.
Differently, with the concept of scale, several conceptions compete for a
consistent meaning. Scale is typically regarded as way to indicate the degree
of detail in which an observation is performed. But surprisingly, there is not
a unified definition of scale as a description's property. This paper offers a
precise definition of scale, and a method to quantify it as a property
associated to the interpretation of a description. To complete the parameters
needed to describe the perception of a description, the concepts of scope and
resolution are also exposed with an exact meaning. A model describing the
recursive process of interpretation, based on evolving steps of scale, scope
and resolution, is introduced. The model relies on the conception of
observation scale and its association to the selection of symbols. Five
experiments illustrate the application of these concepts, showing that
resolution, scale and scope integrate the set of properties to define any point
of view from which an observation is performed and interpreted.
