modeling and visualization of complex systems. Emphasis is on the ideas that
allowed the successful progressive development of this modeling platform, which
goes along with the implementation of applications to the modeling of several
studied systems. The platform can represent different aspects of systems
modeled at different observation scales. This tool offers advantages in the
sense of favoring the perception of the phenomenon of the emergence of
information, associated with changes of scale. This paper also includes some
criteria used for the construction of this modeling platform. The power of
current computers has made practical representing graphic resources such as
shapes, line thickness, overlaying-text tags, colors, and transparencies, in
the graphical modeling of systems. By visualizing diagrams conveniently
designed to highlight contrasts, these modeling platforms allow the recognition
of patterns that drive our understanding of systems and their structure. Graphs
reflecting the benefits of the tool regarding the visualization of systems at
different scales of observation are presented to illustrate the application of
the platform.

performance in terms of downlink signal-to-interference (SIR) coverage
probability and network area spectral efficiency (ASE). A sophisticated bounded
dual-slope path loss model and practical user equipment (UE) densities are
incorporated in the analysis, which have never been jointly considered before.
By using stochastic geometry, we derive an integral expression along with
closed-form bounds of the coverage probability and ASE, validated by simulation
results. Through these, we provide the asymptotic behavior of
ultra-densification. The coverage probability and ASE have non-zero convergence
in asymptotic regions unless UE density goes to infinity (full load).
Meanwhile, the effect of UE density on the coverage probability is analyzed.
The coverage probability will reveal an U-shape for large UE densities due to
interference fall into the near-field, but it will keep increasing for low UE
densites. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance is
overestimated without applying the bounded dual-slope path loss model. The
derived expressions and results in this work pave the way for future network
provisioning.

active users, it is possible that many BSs are instantaneously left idle. Thus,
how to utilize these dormant BSs by means of cooperative transmission is an
interesting question. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a UDN
with two types of cooperation schemes: non-coherent joint transmission (JT)
without channel state information (CSI) and coherent JT with full CSI
knowledge. We consider a bounded dual-slope path loss model to describe UDN
environments where a user has several BSs in the near-field and the rest in the
far-field. Numerical results show that non-coherent JT cannot improve the user
spectral efficiency (SE) due to the simultaneous increment in signal and
interference powers. For coherent JT, the achievable SE gain depends on the
range of near-field, the relative densities of BSs and users, and the CSI
accuracy. Finally, we assess the energy efficiency (EE) of cooperation in UDN.
Despite costing extra energy consumption, cooperation can still improve EE
under certain conditions.

made out of perfect electric conductors (PECs) can mimic highly localized

accurately model LSP resonances in a two-dimensional periodically decorated PEC
cylinder. The accuracy of previous models is limited to structures with
deep-subwavelength and high number of grooves. However, we show that our model
can successfully predict the ultra-sharp LSP resonances which exist in

correctly predictable with previous models that give some spurious resonances.
The success of the proposed model is indebted to the incorporation of an
effective surface conductivity which is created at the interface of the
cylinder and the homogeneous medium surrounding the structure. This surface
conductivity models the effect of higher diffracted orders which are excited in
the periodic structure. The validity of the proposed model is verified by
full-wave simulations.

Central Molecular Zone, the inner few hundred parsecs of our Galaxy. Its origin
is, however, not fully understood. It was proposed that the high cosmic ray
ionisation rate in this region could lead to a more efficient non-thermal
desorption of this species formed on grain surfaces, but it would also mean
that this species is destroyed in a relatively short timescale. In a first
step, we run chemical models with a high cosmic ray ionisation rate and find
that this scenario can only reproduce the lowest abundances of methanol derived
in this region ($\sim$10$^{-9}$-10$^{-8}$). In a second step, we investigate
another scenario based on episodic explosions of grain mantles. We find a good
agreement between the predicted abundances of methanol and the observations. We
find that the dominant route for the formation of methanol is through
hydrogenation of CO on the grains followed by the desorption due to the grain
mantle explosion. The cyclic aspect of this model can explain the widespread
presence of methanol without requiring any additional mechanism. We also model
silicon monoxide (SiO), another species detected in several molecular clouds of
the Galactic Centre. An agreement is found with observations for a high
depletion of Si (Si/H $\sim$ 10$^{-8}$) with respect to the solar abundance.

temperature are the electrostatic two-stream mode and the quasi-electrostatic
oblique mode. Both waves grow and saturate via the formation of phase space
vortices. The strong electric fields of these nonlinear plasma structures
provide an efficient means of heating up and compressing the inflowing upstream

region, with the inflowing cool upstream leptons continuously drives
electrostatic waves that mediate the shock. These waves heat up the inflowing
upstream leptons primarily along the shock normal, which results in an
anisotropic velocity distribution in the post-shock region. This distribution
gives rise to the Weibel instability. Our simulation shows that even if the

having heavy demand for online video services are more willing to pay higher
prices for better services than light users that mainly use e-mails and instant

service differentiations so as to optimize their profits and allocation of
network resources. Much prior work has focused on the viability of network
service differentiation by comparing with the case of a single-class service.
However, the optimal service differentiation for an ISP subject to resource
constraints has remained unsolved. In this work, we establish an optimal

differentiation, i.e. the optimal service qualities and associated prices. By
analyzing the structures of the solution, we reveal how an ISP should adjust
the service qualities and prices in order to meet varying capacity constraints
and users' characteristics. We also obtain the conditions under which ISPs have
strong incentives to implement service differentiation and whether regulators

We combine results of
Chen, Zhuk and Carvalho et al. to argue that if A satisfies the polynomially

result of Zhuk to prove a converse, that if QCSP(Inv(A)) satisfies the
exponentially generated powers property (EGP), then QCSP(Inv(A)) is co-NP-hard.
Since Zhuk proved that only PGP and EGP are possible, we derive a full
dichotomy for the QCSP, justifying the moral correctness of what we term the
Chen Conjecture.
  We examine in closer detail the situation for domains of size three. Over any
finite domain, the only type of PGP that can occur is switchability.
Switchability was introduced by Chen as a generalisation of the already-known
Collapsibility. For three-element domain algebras A that are Switchable, we
prove that for every finite subset Delta of Inv(A), Pol(Delta) is Collapsible.
The significance of this is that, for QCSP on finite structures (over
three-element domain), all QCSP tractability explained by Switchability is
already explained by Collapsibility.
  Finally, we present a three-element domain complexity classification
vignette, using known as well as derived results.

arguments, in principle, for likelihood-based inferences, the treatment

(e.g. position and momentum) give a system's state. In quantum mechanics,
measurement-induced disturbance is largest for complementary properties and,
hence, limits the precision with which such properties can be determined
simultaneously. It is tempting to try to sidestep this disturbance by copying
the system and measuring each complementary property on a separate copy.
However, perfect copying is physically impossible in quantum mechanics. Here,
we investigate using the closest quantum analog to this copying strategy,
optimal cloning. The coherent portion of the generated clones' state
corresponds to ""twins"" of the input system. Like perfect copies, both twins
faithfully reproduce the properties of the input system. Unlike perfect copies,
the twins are entangled. As such, a measurement on both twins is equivalent to
a simultaneous measurement on the input system. For complementary observables,
this joint measurement gives the system's state, just as in the classical case.
We demonstrate this experimentally using polarized single photons.

is a ram-pressure-stripped core that appears to have traversed the densest
parts of the cluster after entering the ICM from the direction of a galaxy
filament to the SE. We detect a density discontinuity NNE of this core which we
speculate is associated with a cold front. Our radio images reveal new details
for the complex radio relic and radio halo in this cluster. In addition, we
discover several new filamentary radio sources with sizes of 100-300 kpc. A few
of these seem to be connected to the main radio relic, while others are either
embedded within the radio halo or projected onto it. A narrow-angled-tailed
(NAT) radio galaxy, a cluster member, is located at the center of the radio
relic. The steep spectrum tails of this AGN leads into the large radio relic
where the radio spectrum flattens again. This morphological connection between
the NAT radio galaxy and relic provides evidence for re-acceleration (revival)
of fossil electrons. The presence of hot $\gtrsim 20$ keV ICM gas detected by
Chandra near the relic location provides additional support for this
re-acceleration scenario.

in general. Linear decision rules (LDRs) yield an approximation of an MSLP by
restricting the decisions at each stage to be an affine function of the
observed uncertain parameters. Finding an optimal LDR is a static optimization
problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal value of the MSLP, and,
under certain assumptions, can be formulated as an explicit linear program.
Similarly, as proposed by Kuhn, Wiesemann, and Georghiou (Math. Program., 130,
177-209, 2011) a lower bound for an MSLP can be obtained by restricting
decisions in the dual of the MSLP to follow an LDR. We propose a new
approximation approach for MSLPs, two-stage LDRs. The idea is to require only
the state variables in an MSLP to follow an LDR, which is sufficient to obtain
an approximation of an MSLP that is a two-stage stochastic linear program
(2SLP). We similarly propose to apply LDR only to a subset of the variables in
the dual of the MSLP, which yields a 2SLP approximation of the dual that
provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the MSLP. Although solving the
corresponding 2SLP approximations exactly is intractable in general, we
investigate how approximate solution approaches that have been developed for
solving 2SLP can be applied to solve these approximation problems, and derive
statistical upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of the MSLP. In
addition to potentially yielding better policies and bounds, this approach
requires many fewer assumptions than are required to obtain an explicit
reformulation when using the standard static LDR approach. A computational
study on two example problems demonstrates that using a two-stage LDR can yield
significantly better primal policies and modestly better dual policies than
using policies based on a static LDR.

Riesz transforms on Lie groups ${G}={G}_{x} \times {G}_{y}$ that are multiply
connected, composed of a discrete abelian component ${G}_{x}$ and a connected
component ${G}_{y}$ endowed with a biinvariant measure. These estimates include
new sharp $L^p$ estimates via Choi type constants, depending upon the

  It was shown recently by Arcozzi, Domelevo and Petermichl that such second
order Riesz transforms applied to a function may be written as conditional
expectation of a simple transformation of a stochastic integral associated with
the function.
  The proofs of our theorems combine this stochastic integral representation
with a number of deep estimates for pairs of martingales under strong
differential subordination by Choi, Banuelos and Osekowski.
  When two continuous directions are available, sharpness is shown via the
laminates technique. We show that sharpness is preserved in the discrete case

stream-fed asynchronous polar in which accretion switches between magnetic
poles (that are $\approx$120$^{\circ}$ apart) when the accretion rate is at
minimum. High-amplitude X-ray modulation at periods of 94.8$\pm$0.4 minutes and
14.7$\pm$1.2 hr are seen. The former appears to be the spin period, while
latter is inferred to be one-third of the beat period between the spin and the
orbit, implying an orbital period of 98.3$\pm$0.5 minutes. We also measure an
optical emission-line spectroscopic period of 98.413$\pm$0.004 minutes which is
consistent with the orbital period inferred from the X-rays. In any case, this

on a time scale of hours in addition to exhibiting occasional sharp flares. It
resembles the black widow or redback pulsars that have been discovered as

the photosphere of a low-mass companion star by, in this case, an as-yet
undetected MSP. We propose XMMU J083850.38-282756.8 as the MSP counterpart of

Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions with non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field
theory. In the absence of driving melting proceeds differently depending on the
quench of the interactions to hopping ratio $U/J_0$ from the atomic limit. For
$U \gg J_0$ decay occurs due to mobile charge-excitations transferring energy
to the spin sector, while for $J_0 \gtrsim U$ it is governed by the dynamics of
residual quasi-particles. Here we explore the rich effects strong periodic
driving has on this relaxation process spanning three frequency $\omega$
regimes: (i) high-frequency $\omega \gg U,J_0$, (ii) resonant $l\omega = U >
J_0$ with integer $l$, and (iii) in-gap $U > \omega > J_0$ away from resonance.
In case (i) we can quickly switch the decay from quasi-particle to
charge-excitation mechanism through the suppression of $J_0$. For (ii) the
interaction can be engineered, even allowing an effective $U=0$ regime to be
reached, giving the reverse switch from a charge-excitation to quasi-particle
decay mechanism. For (iii) the exchange interaction can be controlled with
little effect on the decay. By combining these regimes we show how periodic
driving could be a potential pathway for controlling magnetism in
antiferromagnetic materials. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the
accuracy and applicability of matrix product state techniques to the

some types of systems are yet to be observed. Circumstellar planets around one
star in a binary have been found, but not for tight binaries (< 5 AU).
Additionally, extra-solar moons are yet to be found. This paper motivates
finding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical
probabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual
inclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body
motion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and
make it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5-10 yr.
Circumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational
challenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature
that may be difficult to identify. This may help explain their present
non-detection, or maybe they simply do not exist. Whilst this paper considers
binaries of all orientations, it is demonstrated how eclipsing binaries
favourably bias the transit probabilities, sometimes to the point of being
guaranteed. Transits of exomoons exhibit a similar behaviour under precession,
but unfortunately only have one star to transit rather than two.

risk because of the guarantees they provide to buyers of these products.
Managing and hedging these risks requires insurers to find the value of key
risk metrics for a large portfolio of VA products. In practice, many companies
rely on nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to find key risk metrics. MC
simulations are computationally demanding, forcing insurance companies to
invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in computational infrastructure per
year. Moreover, existing academic methodologies are focused on fair valuation
of a single VA contract, exploiting ideas in option theory and regression. In
most cases, the computational complexity of these methods surpasses the
computational requirements of MC simulations. Therefore, academic methodologies
cannot scale well to large portfolios of VA contracts. In this paper, we
present a framework for valuing such portfolios based on spatial interpolation.
We provide a comprehensive study of this framework and compare existing
interpolation schemes. Our numerical results show superior performance, in
terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy, for these methods compared
to nested MC simulations. We also present insights into the challenge of
finding an effective interpolation scheme in this framework, and suggest

those that involve processing and storing data streams. In streaming
applications with high data rates, a sketch ""fills up"" very quickly. Thus, its
contents are periodically transferred to the remote collector, which is
responsible for answering queries. In this paper, we propose a new sketch,
called Slim-Fat (SF) sketch, which has a significantly higher accuracy compared
to prior art, a much smaller memory footprint, and at the same time achieves
the same speed as the best prior sketch. The key idea behind our proposed
SF-sketch is to maintain two separate sketches: a small sketch called
Slim-subsketch and a large sketch called Fat-subsketch. The Slim-subsketch is
periodically transferred to the remote collector for answering queries quickly
and accurately. The Fat-subsketch, however, is not transferred to the remote
collector because it is used only to assist the Slim-subsketch during the
insertions and deletions and is not used to answer queries. We implemented and
extensively evaluated SF-sketch along with several prior sketches and compared
them side by side. Our experimental results show that SF-sketch outperforms the
most widely used CM-sketch by up to 33.1 times in terms of accuracy. We have
released the source codes of our proposed sketch as well as existing sketches
at Github. The short version of this paper will appear in ICDE 2017.

Such expert information allows for one to choose from among the many possible

worst-case risk measure and confidence in the expert information. Our bound is
developed when the only information available on the bivariate marginals forms
a tree structure in which case it is efficiently computable using convex

related to the leaked amount of information, which is usually done by sampling
of the communication data. When the data size is finite, the final key rate
depends on how the estimation process handles statistical fluctuations. Many of
the present security analyses are based on the method with simple random
sampling, where hypergeometric distribution or its known bounds are used for
the estimation. Here we propose a concise method based on Bernoulli sampling,
which is related to binomial distribution. Our method is suitable for the BB84
protocol with weak coherent pulses, reducing the number of estimated parameters
to achieve a higher key generation rate compared to the method with simple
random sampling. We also applied the method to prove the security of the
differential-quadrature-phase-shift (DQPS) protocol in the finite-key regime.
The result indicates that, the advantage of the DQPS protocol over the
phase-encoding BB84 protocol in terms of the key rate, which was previously
confirmed in the asymptotic regime, persists in the finite-key regime.

population as a simple power law, $N(E) \propto E^{-p}$ for $p \gtrsim 2$.
However, in standard Fermi shock acceleration a substantial fraction of the
swept-up particles do not enter the acceleration process at all. Additionally,
if acceleration is efficient then the nonlinear backreaction of accelerated
particles on the shock structure modifies the shape of the non-thermal tail of
the particle spectra. Both of these modifications to the standard synchrotron
afterglow impact the luminosity, spectra, and temporal variation of the
afterglow. To examine the effects of including thermal particles and nonlinear
particle acceleration on afterglow emission, we follow a hydrodynamical model
for an afterglow jet and simulate acceleration at numerous points during the
evolution. When thermal particles are included, we find that the electron
population is at no time well-fitted by a single power law, though the
highest-energy electrons are; if the acceleration is efficient, then the power
law region is even smaller. Our model predicts hard-soft-hard spectral
evolution at X-ray energies, as well as an uncoupled X-ray and optical light
curve. Additionally, we show that including emission from thermal particles has
drastic effects (factors of 100 and 30, respectively) on the observed flux at
optical and GeV energies. This enhancement of GeV emission makes afterglow
detections by future $\gamma$-ray observatories, such as CTA, very likely.

adversary's prior knowledge of possible secret values as a single probability
distribution. This representation may miss important structure. For instance,
representing prior knowledge about passwords of a system's users in this way
overlooks the fact that many users generate passwords using some strategy.
Knowledge of such strategies can help the adversary in guessing a secret, so
ignoring them may underestimate the secret's vulnerability. In this paper we
explicitly model strategies as distributions on secrets, and generalize the
representation of the adversary's prior knowledge from a distribution on
secrets to an environment, which is a distribution on strategies (and, thus, a
distribution on distributions on secrets, called a hyper-distribution). By
applying information-theoretic techniques to environments we derive several
meaningful generalizations of the traditional approach to QIF. In particular,
we disentangle the vulnerability of a secret from the vulnerability of the
strategies that generate secrets, and thereby distinguish security by
aggregation--which relies on the uncertainty over strategies--from security by
strategy--which relies on the intrinsic uncertainty within a strategy. We also
demonstrate that, in a precise way, no further generalization of prior
knowledge (e.g., by using distributions of even higher order) is needed to
soundly quantify the vulnerability of the secret.

of its kind and holds promise in providing good inferences for small area means

many disciplines. One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is
that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the
observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition
on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had
a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust
for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding
between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment
covariate might have greater bias than estimators without adjusting for this
covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes
instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder, and affect the
outcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this
phenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill in this gap in
the literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon
happens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity
assumptions. We further show that when the treatment follows an additive or
multiplicative model conditional on the instrumental variable and the
confounder, these monotonicity assumptions can be interpreted as the signs of
the arrows of the causal diagrams.

superconductors is what determines the maximum transition temperature (Tc,max),
which varies from less than 30 K to above 130 K in different compounds. Despite
this dramatic variation, a robust trend is that within each family, the
double-layer compound always has higher Tc,max than the single-layer
counterpart. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the
electronic structure of four cuprate parent compounds belonging to two
different families. We find that within each family, the double layer compound
has a much smaller charge transfer gap size ($\Delta_{CT}$), indicating a clear
anticorrelation between $\Delta_{CT}$ and Tc,max. These results suggest that
the charge transfer gap plays a key role in the superconducting physics of
cuprates, which shed important new light on the high Tc mechanism from doped
Mott insulator perspective.

following reverse tapered undulator section to generate strong coherent
microbunchings while maintain the good quality of the electron beam. After
that, the pre-bunched electron beam is sent into the third undulator section
which resonates at a target high harmonic of the seed to amplify the coherent

information at the single-qubit level is an essential ingredient for practical
quantum computation and com-munication. Recently, there have been remarkable
progresses of increasing coherence time for ensemble-based quantum memories of
trapped ions, nuclear spins of ionized donors or nuclear spins in a solid.
Until now, however, the record of coherence time of a single qubit is on the
order of a few tens of seconds demonstrated in trapped ion systems. The qubit
coherence time in a trapped ion is mainly limited by the increasing magnetic
field fluctuation and the decreasing state-detection efficiency associated with
the motional heating of the ion without laser cooling. Here we report the
coherence time of a single qubit over $10$ minutes in the hyperfine states of a
\Yb ion sympathetically cooled by a \Ba ion in the same Paul trap, which
eliminates the heating of the qubit ion even at room temperature. To reach such
coherence time, we apply a few thousands of dynamical decoupling pulses to
suppress the field fluctuation noise. A long-time quantum memory demonstrated
in this experiment makes an important step for construction of the memory zone
in scalable quantum computer architectures or for ion-trap-based quantum
networks. With further improvement of the coherence time by techniques such as
magnetic field shielding and increase of the number of qubits in the quantum
memory, our demonstration also makes a basis for other applications including
quantum money.

decision-making problems under certainty, which finds solutions that perform
well for a chosen set of probability distributions. Many different approaches
for specifying a set of distributions have been proposed. The choice matters,
because it affects the results, and the relative performance of different
choices depend on the characteristics of the problems. In this paper, we
consider problems in which different random variables exhibit some form of
dependence, but the exact values of the parameters that represent the
dependence are not known. We consider various sets of distributions that
incorporate the dependence structure, and we study the corresponding DRSO
problems.
  In the first part of the paper, we consider problems with linear dependence
between random variables. We consider sets of distributions that are within a
specified Wasserstein distance of a nominal distribution, and that satisfy a
second-order moment constraint. We obtain a tractable dual reformulation of the
corresponding DRSO problem. This approach is compared with the traditional
moment-based DRSO and Wasserstein-based DRSO with no moment constraints.
Numerical experiments suggest that our new formulation has superior
out-of-sample performance.
  In the second part of the paper, we consider problems with various types of
rank dependence between random variables, including rank dependence measured by
Spearman's footrule distance between empirical rankings, comonotonic
distributions, box uncertainty for individual observations, and Wasserstein
distance between copulas associated with continuous distributions. We also
obtain a dual reformulation of the DRSO problem. A desirable byproduct of the
formulation is that it also avoids an issue associated with the one-sided
moment constraints in moment-based DRSO problems.

be thermal convection in the metallic liquid iron core. Computational
considerations previously restricted most numerical simulations to a regime
where the diffusivities of momentum and electric current are roughly equal,
leading to similar spectra for both velocities and magnetic fields. Here we
present results of a suite of self-consistent spherical shell computations with
ultra-low viscosities. The most Earth-like of our models (S4) has a twenty-fold
difference in the aforementioned diffusivities, leading to significant scale
separation between magnetic and velocity fields, the latter being dominated by
small scales. This has repercussions for the leading force balance, which can
be magnetostrophic at large scales (with a major role played by the Lorentz
force) whereas small scales require a different balance. This is the so-called
strong field limit. Outside boundary layers, viscous forces have a magnitude
which is about one thousandth of the Lorentz force. In this dynamo dissipation
is almost exclusively Ohmic, as in the Earth, with convection inside the
so-called tangent cylinder playing a crucial role. Our most extreme dynamo has
significantly more magnetic energy than kinetic energy (as in the Earth). Our
model suggests Ohmic dissipation in the Earth's core is as high as 10TW.

available in (sub-)millimeter observatories deliver wide- field hyperspectral
imaging of the interstellar medium. Tens of spectral lines can be observed over
degree wide fields in about fifty hours. This wealth of data calls for
restating the physical questions about the interstellar medium in statistical
terms. Aims. We aim at gaining information on the physical structure of the
interstellar medium from a statistical analysis of many lines from different
species over a large field of view, without requiring detailed radiative
transfer or astrochemical modeling. Methods. We coupled a nonlinear rescaling
of the data with one of the simplest multivariate analysis methods, namely the
Principal Component Analysis, to decompose the observed signal into components
that we interpret first qualitatively and then quantitatively based on our deep
knowledge of the observed region and of the astrochemistry at play. Results. We
identify 3 principal components, linear compositions of line brightness
temperatures, that are correlated at various levels with the column density,
the volume density and the UV radiation field. Conclusions. When sampling a
sufficiently diverse mixture of physical parameters, it is possible to
decompose the molecular emission in order to gain physical insight on the
observed interstellar medium. This opens a new avenue for future studies of the
interstellar medium.

materials may be driven into transient excited states describable by two
chemical potentials, one for the electrons and one for the holes. Given the
Dirac nature of the spectrum, such an inverted population allows the optical
tunability of the density of states of the electrons and holes, effectively
offering control of the strength of the Coulomb interaction. Here we discuss
the feasibility of realizing transient excitonic instabilities in
optically-pumped Dirac materials. We demonstrate, theoretically, the reduction
of the critical coupling leading to the formation of a transient condensate of
electron-hole pairs and identify signatures of this state. Furthermore, we
provide guidelines for experiments by both identifying the regimes in which
such exotic many-body states are more likely to be observed and estimating the
magnitude of the excitonic gap for a few important examples of existing Dirac
materials. We find a set of material parameters for which our theory predicts
large gaps and high critical temperatures and which could be realized in future
Dirac materials. We also comment on transient excitonic instabilities in
three-dimensional Dirac and Weyl semimetals. This study provides the first
example of a transient collective instability in driven Dirac materials.

mobile applications that allow travelers to navigate efficiently in cities. In
taxi transport the recent proliferation of Uber has introduced new norms
including a flexible pricing scheme where journey costs can change rapidly
depending on passenger demand and driver supply. To make informed choices on
the most appropriate provider for their journeys, travelers need access to
knowledge about provider pricing in real time. To this end, we developed
OpenStreetcab a mobile application that offers advice on taxi transport
comparing provider prices. We describe its development and deployment in two
cities, London and New York, and analyse thousands of user journey queries to
compare the price patterns of Uber against major local taxi providers. We have
observed large heterogeneity across the taxi transport markets in the two
cities. This motivated us to perform a price validation and measurement
experiment on the ground comparing Uber and Black Cabs in London. The
experimental results reveal interesting insights: not only they confirm
feedback on pricing and service quality received by professional drivers users,
but also they reveal the tradeoffs between prices and journey times between
taxi providers. With respect to journey times in particular, we show how
experienced taxi drivers, in the majority of the cases, are able to navigate
faster to a destination compared to drivers who rely on modern navigation
systems. We provide evidence that this advantage becomes stronger in the centre
of a city where urban density is high.

hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ and the Compton reflection scaling factor
$\Re$ in active galactic nuclei. In this paper, we propose that the
$\Gamma-\Re$ correlation can be explained within the framework of the
condensation of the hot corona onto the cold accretion disc around a
supermassive black hole. In the model, it is presumed that, initially, a
vertically extended hot gas (corona) is supplied to the central supermassive
black hole by capturing the interstellar medium and stellar wind. In this
scenario, when the initial mass accretion rate $\dot M/ \dot M_{\rm Edd}
\gtrsim 0.01$, at a critical radius $r_{\rm d}$, part of the hot gas begins to
condense onto the equatorial disc plane of the black hole, forming an inner
cold accretion disc. Then the matter is accreted in the form of the disc-corona
structure extending down to the innermost stable circular orbits of the black
hole. The size of the inner disc is determined by the initial mass accretion
rate. With the increase of the initial mass accretion rate, the size of the
inner disc increases, which results in both the increase of the Compton
reflection scaling factor $\Re$ and the increase of the hard X-ray photon index
$\Gamma$. By comparing with a sample of Seyfert galaxies with well-fitted X-ray
spectra, it is found that our model can roughly explain the observations.
Finally, we discuss the possibility to apply our model to high mass X-ray
binaries, which are believed to be fueled by the hot wind from the companion
star.

therapy for permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and assessing its eventual
relationship with reduced exercise tolerance are lacking. The present study
aims at investigating the impact of resting HR on the hemodynamic response to
exercise in permanent AF patients by means of a computational cardiovascular
model.
  Methods. The AF lumped-parameter model was run to simulate resting (1
Metabolic Equivalent of Task-MET) and various exercise conditions (4 METs:
brisk walking; 6 METs: skiing; 8 METs: running), considering different resting
HR (70 bpm for the slower resting HR-SHR simulations, and 100 bpm for the
higher resting HR-HHR simulations). To compare relative variations of
cardiovascular variables upon exertion, the variation comparative index (VCI) -
the absolute variation between the exercise and the resting values in SHR
simulations referred to the absolute variation in HHR simulations -was
calculated at each exercise grade (VCI4, VCI6 and VCI8).
  Results. Pulmonary venous pressure underwent a greater increase in HHR
compared to SHR simulations (VCI4 = 0.71, VCI6 = 0.73 and VCI8 = 0.77), while
for systemic arterial pressure the opposite is true (VCI4 = 1.15, VCI6 = 1.36,
VCI8 = 1.56).
  Conclusions. The computational findings suggest that a slower, with respect
to a higher resting HR, might be preferable in permanent AF patients, since
during exercise pulmonary venous pressure undergoes a slighter increase and
systemic blood pressure reveals a more appropriate increase.

audio information to do Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is one of the
application of multimodal leaning making ASR system more robust and accuracy.
The traditional models usually treated AVSR as inference or projection but
strict prior limits its ability. As the revival of deep learning, Deep Neural
Networks (DNN) becomes an important toolkit in many traditional classification
tasks including ASR, image classification, natural language processing. Some
DNN models were used in AVSR like Multimodal Deep Autoencoders (MDAEs),
Multimodal Deep Belief Network (MDBN) and Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine
(MDBM) that actually work better than traditional methods. However, such DNN
models have several shortcomings: (1) They don't balance the modal fusion and
temporal fusion, or even haven't temporal fusion; (2)The architecture of these
models isn't end-to-end, the training and testing getting cumbersome. We
propose a DNN model, Auxiliary Multimodal LSTM (am-LSTM), to overcome such
weakness. The am-LSTM could be trained and tested once, moreover easy to train
and preventing overfitting automatically. The extensibility and flexibility are
also take into consideration. The experiments show that am-LSTM is much better
than traditional methods and other DNN models in three datasets.

gravitational field. For incompressible flows the radial center of mass
velocity of blobs and depletions is proportional to the square root of their
initial cross-field size and amplitude. If the flows are compressible, this
scaling holds only for ratios of amplitude to size larger than a critical
value. Otherwise, the maximum blob and depletion velocity depends linearly on
the initial amplitude and is independent of size. In both cases the
acceleration of blobs and depletions depends on their initial amplitude
relative to the background plasma density, is proportional to gravity and
independent of their cross-field size. Due to their reduced inertia plasma
depletions accelerate more quickly than the corresponding blobs. These scaling
laws are derived from the invariants of the governing drift-fluid equations and
agree excellently with numerical simulations over five orders of magnitude. We
suggest an empirical model that unifies and correctly captures the radial
acceleration and maximum velocities of both blobs and depletions.

The setup is designed as an open system which operates with small amounts of
dispersion of $\approx 20\,\mu$l, permits the use of coated and patterned
samples, and allows high-numerical-aperture microscopy access. Piezo elements
enable 5D relative positioning of the surfaces. We achieve a parallelization of
less than $1\,$nm vertical deviation over a lateral distance of $10\,\mu$m. The
vertical separation is tunable and detectable with subnanometer accuracy down
to direct contact. At rest, the gap distance is stable on a nanometer level.
Using the tool we measure the vertical position termed height and the lateral
diffusion of $60\,$nm charged Au nanospheres as a function of confinement
between a glass and a polymer surface. Interferometric scattering detection
results in sub $10\,$nm vertical and sub $5\,$nm lateral particle localization
accuracy, and a single particle illumination time below $40\,\mu$s. We measure
the height of the particles to be consistently above the gap center,
corresponding to a higher charge on the polymer substrate. In terms of
diffusion, we find a strong monotonic decay of the diffusion constant with
decreasing gap distance. This result cannot be explained by hydrodynamic
effects, including the asymmetric vertical position of the particles in the
gap. Instead we attribute it to an electroviscous effect. For strong
confinement of less than $120\,$nm gap distance, we detect an onset of
sub-diffusion which can be correlated to a motion of the particles along

$[\alpha,\beta]$-Hausdorff type moment problems. It is shown that each
$[\alpha,\beta]$-Hausdorff moment sequence has a particular intrinsic
structure. More precisely, each element of this sequence varies within a closed
bounded matricial interval. The case that the corresponding moment coincides
with one of the endpoints of the interval plays a particular important role.
This leads to distinguished molecular solutions of the truncated matricial
$[\alpha,\beta]$-Hausdorff moment problem, which satisfy some extremality
properties. The proofs are mainly of algebraic character. The use of the
parallel sum of matrices is an essential tool in the proofs.

processes which are ergodic with respect to this density. As observed in a
number of papers, samplers based on nonreversible diffusion processes can
significantly outperform their reversible counterparts both in terms of
asymptotic variance and rate of convergence to equilibrium. In this paper, we
take advantage of this in order to construct efficient sampling algorithms
based on the Lie-Trotter decomposition of a nonreversible diffusion process
into reversible and nonreversible components. We show that samplers based on
this scheme can significantly outperform standard MCMC methods, at the cost of
introducing some controlled bias. In particular, we prove that numerical
integrators constructed according to this decomposition are geometrically
ergodic and characterise fully their asymptotic bias and variance, showing that
the sampler inherits the good mixing properties of the underlying nonreversible
diffusion. This is illustrated further with a number of numerical examples
ranging from highly correlated low dimensional distributions, to logistic
regression problems in high dimensions as well as inference for spatial models
with many latent variables.

to scale urban systems to sustaining the quality of services for citizen at
scale. Understanding the dynamics of cities is critical towards informed
strategic urban planning. This paper showcases QuantifiedCity, a system aimed
at understanding the complex dynamics taking place in cities. Often, these
dynamics involve humans, services, and infrastructures and are observed in
different spaces: physical (IoT-based) sensing and human (social-based)
sensing. The main challenges the system strives to address are related to data
integration and fusion to enable an effective and semantically relevant data
grouping. This is achieved by considering the spatio-temporal space as a
blocking function for any data generated in the city. Our system consists of
three layer for data acquisition, data analysis, and data visualization; each
of which embeds a variety of modules to better achieve its purpose (e.g., data
crawling, data cleaning, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity
recognition, event detection, time series analysis, etc.) End users can browse
the dynamics through three main dimensions: location, time, and event. For each
dimension, the system renders a set of map-centric widgets that summarize the
underlying related dynamics. This paper highlights the need for such a holistic

facts, the famous Banach-Stone theorem, and some recent works related to
characterisations of onto isometries of spaces of Borel probability measures,

gyrotropy. Along with conventional single-beam experimental arrangement, we
consider here a more complicated, but more informative, two-beam configuration
that implies the use of an auxiliary light beam passing through the same
scattering volume and delivering additional scattered field to the detector. We
show that the signal in the spin noise spectroscopy arising due to heterodyning
of the scattered field is formed only by the scattered field components whose
wave vectors coincide with those of the probe beam. Therefore, in principle,
the detected signal in spin noise spectroscopy can be increased by increasing
overlap of the two fields in the momentum space. We also show that, in the
two-beam geometry, contribution of the auxiliary (tilted) beam to the detected
signal is represented by Fourier transform of the gyrotropy relief at the
difference of two wave vectors. This effect can be used to study spin
correlations by means of noise spectroscopy.

divide each first passage path into nonreactive and reactive segments and to
study them separately. The analysis can be applied to jump processes which are
non-ergodic, as well as continuous-time jump processes where the waiting time
distributions are non-exponential. In the particular case that the jump
processes are both Markovian and ergodic, our analysis elucidates the relations
between the study of the first passage paths and the study of the transition
paths in transition path theory. We provide algorithms to numerically compute

these algorithms scales with the complexity of solving a linear system, for
which efficient methods are available. Several examples demonstrate the wide

Unfortunately, the main lensing galaxy (G1) is so faint and close to the bright

not change previous findings on the mass scale of G1 and external shear, while
the redshift of the lensing mass is found to be consistent with the assumed

mathematical features that have, until recently, not been fully understood. In

regime, we have previously shown that it presents a technical challenge for
rotating Bose gases with low angular momentum. These are systems where the CF
approach yields surprisingly good approximations to the exact eigenstates of
weak short-range interactions, and so solving the problem of linearly dependent
wave functions is of interest. It can also be useful for studying higher bands
of fermionic quantum Hall states. Here we present several ways of constructing
a basis for the space of so-called ""simple"" CF states for two-component
rotating Bose gases in the lowest Landau level, and prove that they all give
sets of linearly independent wave functions that span the space. Using this
basis, we study the structure of the lowest-lying state using so-called
restricted wave functions. We also examine the scaling of the overlap between

release sites to the Earth. We simulate proton propagation by integrating fully

comprehensive statistics into histograms, fluence maps and virtual observer

experience significant current sheet drift to distant longitudes, causing time
profiles to exhibit multiple components, which are a potential source of
confusing interpretation of observations. We find that variation of current
sheet thickness within a realistic parameter range has little effect on
particle propagation. We show that IMF configuration strongly affects
deceleration of protons. We show that in our model, the presence of a flat

invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations generated from the phase
of pre-bounce contraction is shown to be stable against time evolution. In this
work we study the detailed dynamics of the bounce and its imprints on the scale
invariance of the spectrum. The dynamics of the gravitational interactions near
the bounce point may be strongly coupled as the spatial curvature becomes big.
There is no a prior reason to expect the spectral index of the primordial
perturbations of matter density can be preserved. By encoding the bounce
dynamics holographically onto the dynamics of dual Yang-Mills system while the
latter is weakly coupled, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, we can safely evolve
the spectrum of the cosmic perturbations with full control. In this way we can
compare the post-bounce spectrum with the pre-bounce one: in the CSTB model we
explicitly show that the spectrum of primordial density perturbations generated
in the contraction phase preserves its stability as well as scale invariance

this paper we contribute to foundations of such techniques and present a
complete algorithm for synthesis of a class of recursive functions defined by
structural recursion over a given algebraic data type definition. The functions
we consider map an algebraic data type to a string; they are useful for, e.g.,
pretty printing and serialization of programs and data. We formalize our

  The first problem we consider is learning a tree-to-string transducer from
any set of input/output examples provided by the user. We show that this
problem is NP-complete in general, but can be solved in polynomial time under a
(practically useful) closure condition that each subtree of a tree in the

  Because coming up with relevant input/output examples may be difficult for
the user while creating hard constraint problems for the synthesizer, we also
study a more automated active learning scenario in which the algorithm chooses
the inputs for which the user provides the outputs. Our algorithm asks a
worst-case linear number of queries as a function of the size of the algebraic

an arbitrary location. We leverage certain characteristics of ICS networks,
like stability of topology and bandwidth needs predictability, and make use of

to be constructed from arcs of a circle connected at vertices which is an idea
borrowed from Banik and Overhauser. Such a diamond-shaped pocket is proposed to
be the product of biaxial charge-density wave order, which was subsequently
confirmed in x-ray scattering experiments. Since those x-ray scattering
experiments were performed, the biaxial Fermi surface reconstruction scheme has
garnered widespread support in the scientific literature. It has been shown to
accurately account for the cross-section of the Fermi surface pocket observed
in quantum oscillation measurements, the sign and behavior of the Hall
coefficient, the size of the high magnetic field electronic contribution to the
heat capacity and more recently the form of the angle-dependent
magnetoresistance.In their comment, Chakravarty and Wang raise several
important questions relating to the validity of the Hall coefficient we
calculated for such a diamond-shaped Fermi surface pocket. These questions
concern specifically (1) whether a change in sign of the Hall coefficient R_H
with magnetic field and temperature is dependent on a `special' form for the
rounding of the vertices, (2) whether a pocket of such a geometry can produce
quantum oscillations in R_H in the absence of other Fermi surface sections and
(3) whether a reconstructed Fermi surface consisting of a single pocket is less
`natural' than one consisting of multiple pockets. Below we consider each of
these in turn.

characterize gate errors in quantum circuits. Averaging over random sequences
of gates leads to estimates of gate errors in terms of the average fidelity.
These estimates are isolated from the state preparation and measurement errors
that plague other methods like channel tomography and direct fidelity
estimation. A decisive factor in the feasibility of randomized benchmarking is
the number of sampled sequences required to obtain rigorous confidence
intervals. Previous bounds were either prohibitively loose or required the
number of sampled sequences to scale exponentially with the number of qubits in
order to obtain a fixed confidence interval at a fixed error rate. Here we show
that, with a small adaptation to the randomized benchmarking procedure, the
number of sampled sequences required for a fixed confidence interval is
dramatically smaller than could previously be justified. In particular, we show
that the number of sampled sequences required is essentially independent of the
number of qubits and scales favorably with the average error rate of the system
under investigation. We also show that the number of samples required for long
sequence lengths can be made substantially smaller than previous rigorous
results (even for single qubits) as long as the noise process under
investigation is not unitary. Our results bring rigorous randomized
benchmarking on systems with many qubits into the realm of experimental
feasibility.

as the Dirichlet boundary condition of diffusion curves and control tone by
offsetting the Laplacian, where both controls are simply done by mouse click
and slider dragging. The separation of color and tone not only follows the
basic drawing principle that is widely adopted by professional artists, but
also brings three unique features to PVG, i.e., local hue change, ease of
extrema control, and permit of intersection among geometric primitives, making
PVG an ideal authoring tool.

with piecewise constant Laplacians. In contrast to the conventional finite
element method that computes numerical solutions only, our method expresses the
solution using harmonic B-spline, whose basis functions can be constructed
locally and the control coefficients are obtained by solving a small sparse

operators play a central role because, if they are found, the energy spectra
can be obtained algebraically. In this paper, we propose the spectral
intertwining relation as a unified relation of ladder and intertwining
operators in a way that can depend on the energy eigenvalues. It is shown that
the spectral intertwining relations can connect eigenfunctions of different
energy eigenvalues belonging to two different Hamiltonians, which cannot be
obtained by previously known structures such as shape invariance. As an
application, we find new spectral intertwining operators for the Hamiltonians
of the hydrogen atom and the Rosen--Morse potential.

  System",,,"10.3847/2041-8213/aa6d73",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The reconstruction of the orbital evolution of the propeller structure
Bl\'eriot orbiting in Saturn's A ring from recurrent observations in Cassini
ISS images yielded a considerable offset motion from the expected Keplerian
orbit (Tiscareno et al., 2010). This offset motion can be composed by three
sinusoidal harmonics with amplitudes and periods of 1845, 152, 58 km and 11.1,
3.7 and 2.2 years, respectively (Srem\v{c}evi\'c et al., 2014). In this paper
we present results from N-Body simulations, where we integrated the orbital
evolution of a moonlet, which is placed at the radial position of Bl\'eriot
under the gravitational action of the Saturnian satellites. Our simulations
yield, that especially the gravitational interactions with Prometheus, Pandora
and Mimas is forcing the moonlet to librate with the right frequencies, but the
libration-amplitudes are far too small to explain the observations. Thus,
further mechanisms are needed to explain the amplitudes of the forced
librations - e.g. moonlet-ring interactions. Here, we develop a model, where
the moonlet is allowed to be slightly displaced with respect to its created
gaps, resulting in a breaking point-symmetry and in a repulsive force. As a
result, the evolution of the moonlet's longitude can be described by a harmonic
oscillator. In the presence of external forcings by the outer moons, the
libration amplitude gets the more amplified, the more the forcing frequency
gets close to the eigenfrequency of the disturbed propeller oscillator.
Applying our model to Bl\'eriot, it is possible to reproduce a libration period
of 13 years with an amplitude of about 2000 km.

corresponding to lattices of size $N_\sigma^3\times N_\tau$ with aspect ratio
$N_\sigma/N_\tau=4$ and $N_\tau =6-16$. The strange quark mass is tuned to its
physical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$

MeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion
coefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order
expansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical
potentials less then twice the temperature ($\mu_B\le 2T$). The fourth-order
equation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in
heavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\sim
12$ GeV. We provide a parametrization of basic thermodynamic quantities that
can be readily used in hydrodynamic simulation codes. The results on up to
sixth order expansion coefficients of bulk thermodynamics are used for the
calculation of lines of constant pressure, energy and entropy densities in the
$T$-$\mu_B$ plane and are compared with the crossover line for the QCD chiral
transition as well as with experimental results on freeze-out parameters in
heavy ion collisions. These coefficients also provide estimates for the
location of a possible critical point. We argue that results on sixth order
expansion coefficients disfavor the existence of a critical point in the QCD
phase diagram for $\mu_B/T\le 2$ and $T/T_c(\mu_B=0) > 0.9$.

Results: The models can reproduce SED data well at wavelengths longwards of
1{\mu}m, and the interferometric observations between 8{\mu}m and 10{\mu}m.
Discrepancies could be due to a combination of data- and model-related effects.
The models best fitting the Miras are significantly extended, with a prominent
shell-like structure, while the models best fitting the non-Miras are more
compact, showing lower average mass-loss. The mass loss is of episodic or
multi-periodic nature, but causes the visual amplitudes to be notably larger
than the observed ones. Stellar parameters were derived from the model fitting:
T_eff, L_bol, M, C/O, $\dot{\text{M}}$. Our findings agree well with literature
values within the uncertainties. T_eff and L_bol are also in good agreement
with the T derived from the angular diameter {\theta}_{(V-K)} and L_bol from
the SED fitting, except for AQ Sgr. Finally, {\theta}_Ross and {\theta}_(V-K)
agree with each other better for the Miras than for the non-Miras,which is
probably connected to the episodic nature of the latter models. We also located
the stars in the H-R diagram, comparing them with evolutionary tracks. We found

The purpose of this book is to report on the implications of the loop equations

purpose of the implementation of Decision Support (DS) systems for the
operational control of the network systems. In general an operational DS
comprises a series of standalone applications from which the mathematical
modeling and simulation of the distribution systems and the managing of the
uncertainty in the decision-making process are essential in order to obtain
efficient control and monitoring of the distribution systems. The mathematical
modeling and simulation forms the basis for detailed optimization of the
network operations and the second one uses uncertainty based reasoning in order
to reduce the complexity of the network system and to increase the credibility
of its model. This book reports on the integration of the two aspects of
operational DS into a single computational framework of loop network equations.
The proposed DS system will be validated using case studies taken from the
water industry. The optimal control of water distribution systems is an
important problem because the models are non-linear and large-scale and
measurements are prone to errors and very often they are incomplete.

onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during
periods of quiet Sun conditions for a time interval from 1996 to 2015 were
analyzed. The spatial power as a function of the spatial frequency from about
0.04 to 0.27 (EIT) or up to 0.48 (AIA) 1/Mm depends on the distribution of the
observed segmentation-cell dimensions, -- a structure of the solar EUV network.
The temporal variations of the spatial power reported by Didkovsky and Gurman
(Solar Phys., 289, 153) were suggested as decreases at the mid-spatial
frequencies for the compared spectra when the power curves at the highest
spatial frequencies of 0.5 1/pix were adjusted to match each other. That
approach has been extended in this work to compare spectral ratios at high
spatial frequencies expressed in the solar spatial frequency units of 1/Mm.
Based on this approach we represent these ratio changes as a long-term network
transformation which may be interpreted as a continuous dissipation of mid-size
network structures to the smaller-size structures in the transition region. In
contrast to expected cycling of the segmentation-cell dimension structures and
associated spatial power in the spectra with the solar cycle, the spectra
demonstrate a significant and steady change of the EUV network. The temporal
trend across these structural spectra is not critically sensitive to any
long-term instrumental changes, e.g. degradation of sensitivity, but to the
change of the segmentation-cell dimensions of the EUV network structure.

Thus, fog computing provides low latency, location awareness to end users, and
improves quality-of-services (QoS). One key feature in this model is the
designing of payment plan from network operator (NO) to fog nodes (FN) for the
rental of their computing resources, such as computation capacity, spectrum,

design the efficient payment plan to maximize the NO's revenue while
maintaining FN's incentive to cooperate through the moral hazard model in
contract theory. We propose a multi-dimensional contract which considers the
FNs' characteristics such as location, computation capacity, storage,
transmission bandwidth, and etc. First, a contract which pays the FNs by
evaluating the resources they have provided from multiple aspects is proposed.
Then, the utility maximization problem of the NO is formulated. Furthermore, we
use the numerical results to analyze the optimal payment plan, and compare the

supplement some kind of anisotropy. Anisotropy in the dark energy pressure is
found to evolve with cosmic expansion at least at late times. At an early
phase, the anisotropic effect due to the cosmic strings substantially affect
the dynamics of the accelerating universe.

fields in the presence of thermal noise is studied both theoretically and by
performing numerical calculations. Kinetic equations for the dynamics of
particles with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy are studied and the phase lag
between the rotating magnetic moment and the driving field is obtained. It is
shown that for large enough anisotropy energy the magnetic moment is locked to
the anisotropy axis so that the particle behaves like a rotating magnetic
dipole. The corresponding rigid dipole model is analyzed both numerically by
solving the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation and analytically by applying an
effective field method. In the special case of a rotating magnetic field
applied analytic results are obtained in perfect agreement with numerical
results based on the Fokker-Planck equation. The analytic formulas derived are
not restricted to small magnetic fields or low frequencies and are therefore
important for applications. The illustrative numerical calculations presented
are performed for magnetic parameters typical for iron oxide.
