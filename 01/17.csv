edges are revealed in a streaming manner. We consider both insertion-only
streams and dynamic streams and present new upper and lower bound results for
both models.
  On the upper bound front, we show that an $\alpha$-approximate estimate of
the matching size can be computed in dynamic streams using
$\widetilde{O}({n^2/\alpha^4})$ space, and in insertion-only streams using
$\widetilde{O}(n/\alpha^2)$-space. On the lower bound front, we prove that any
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for estimating matching size in dynamic graph
streams requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\alpha^{2.5})$ bits of space, even if the
underlying graph is both sparse and has arboricity bounded by $O(\alpha)$. We
further improve our lower bound to $\Omega(n/\alpha^2)$ in the case of dense
graphs.

insertion-only streams requires RS$(n) \cdot n^{1-O(\epsilon)}$ space; here,
RS${n}$ denotes the maximum number of edge-disjoint induced matchings of size
$\Theta(n)$ in an $n$-vertex graph. It is a major open problem to determine the
value of RS$(n)$, and current results leave open the possibility that RS$(n)$
may be as large as $n/\log n$. We also show how to avoid the dependency on the
parameter RS$(n)$ in proving lower bound for dynamic streams and present a
near-optimal lower bound of $n^{2-O(\epsilon)}$ for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in this model.
  Using a well-known connection between matching size and matrix rank, all our
lower bounds also hold for the problem of estimating matrix rank. In particular
our results imply a near-optimal $n^{2-O(\epsilon)}$ bit lower bound for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of matrix ranks for dense matrices in dynamic
streams, answering an open question of Li and Woodruff (STOC 2016).

multivariate signals, it is also often the case that the inter-component
correlation structure is not fractally connected, i.e., its scaling behavior is
not determined by that of the individual components. To model this situation in
a versatile manner, we introduce a class of multivariate Gaussian stochastic
processes called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion (HfBm). Its theoretical
study sheds light on the issues raised by the joint requirement of entry-wise
scaling and departures from fractal connectivity. An asymptotically normal
wavelet-based estimator for its scaling parameter, called the Hurst matrix, is
proposed, as well as asymptotically valid confidence intervals. The latter are
accompanied by original finite sample procedures for computing confidence
intervals and testing fractal connectivity from one single and finite size
observation. Monte Carlo simulation studies are used to assess the estimation
performance as a function of the (finite) sample size, and to quantify the
impact of omitting wavelet cross-correlation terms. The simulation studies are
shown to validate the use of approximate confidence intervals, together with
the significance level and power of the fractal connectivity test. The test
performance and properties are further studied as functions of the HfBm
parameters.

spin-glass model, in the presence of a uniform transverse field $\Gamma$, and a
longitudinal random field following a Gaussian distribution with width
$\Delta$. The model is studied through the replica formalism. This study is
motivated by experimental investigations on the LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$
compound, where the application of a transverse magnetic field yields rather
intriguing effects, particularly related to the behavior of the nonlinear
magnetic susceptibility $\chi_3$, which have led to a considerable experimental
and theoretical debate. We analyzed two situations, namely, $\Delta$ and
$\Gamma$ considered as independent, as well as these two quantities related as
proposed recently by some authors. In both cases, a spin-glass phase transition
is found at a temperature $T_f$; moreover, $T_f$ decreases by increasing
$\Gamma$ towards a quantum critical point at zero temperature. The situation
where $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$ are related appears to reproduce better the
experimental observations on the LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$ compound, with the
theoretical results coinciding qualitatively with measurements of the nonlinear
susceptibility. In this later case, by increasing $\Gamma$, $\chi_3$ becomes
progressively rounded, presenting a maximum at a temperature $T^*$ ($T^*>T_f$).
Moreover, we also show that the random field is the main responsible for the
smearing of the nonlinear susceptibility, acting significantly inside the
paramagnetic phase, leading to two regimes delimited by the temperature $T^*$,
one for $T_f<T<T^*$, and another one for $T>T^*$. It is argued that the
conventional paramagnetic state corresponds to $T>T^*$, whereas the temperature
region $T_f<T<T^*$ may be characterized by a rather unusual dynamics, possibly
including Griffiths singularities.

understanding and predicting protein structure and stability. It is
well-established that a large contribution to protein stability originates from
the sequestration from solvent of hydrophobic residues in the protein core. How
are such hydrophobic residues arranged in the core? And how can one best model
the packing of these residues? Here we show that to properly model the packing

particles, and particles with bumpy surfaces. We show that amino acids in
protein cores pack as densely as disordered jammed packings of particles with
similar values for the aspect ratio and bumpiness as found for amino acids.
Knowing the structural properties of protein cores is of both fundamental and
practical importance. Practically, it enables the assessment of changes in the
structure and stability of proteins arising from amino acid mutations (such as
those identified as a result of the massive human genome sequencing efforts)
and the design of new folded, stable proteins and protein-protein interactions
with tunable specificity and affinity.

topology changes in time, we study the spatial search algorithm by continuous
time quantum walk to find a marked node on a random temporal network. We
consider a network of $n$ nodes constituted by a time-ordered sequence of
Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n,p)$, where $p$ is the probability that any
two given nodes are connected: after every time interval $\tau$, a new graph
$G(n,p)$ replaces the previous one. We prove analytically that for any given
$p$, there is always a range of values of $\tau$ for which the running time of
the algorithm is optimal, i.e.\ $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$, even when search on
the individual static graphs constituting the temporal network is sub-optimal.
On the other hand, there are regimes of $\tau$ where the algorithm is
sub-optimal even when each of the underlying static graphs are sufficiently
connected to perform optimal search on them. From this first study of quantum
spatial search on a time-dependent network, it emerges that the non-trivial
interplay between temporality and connectivity is key to the algorithmic
performance. Moreover, our work can be extended to establish high-fidelity
qubit transfer between any two nodes of the network. Overall, our findings show
that one can exploit temporality to achieve optimal quantum information tasks
on dynamical random networks.

externally driven two-state (spin-boson) system subjected to strong dissipation
by means of both analytical and extensive numerical calculations. The
phenomenon of resonant activation emerges in the presence of either randomly
fluctuating or deterministic periodically varying driving fields. Addressing
the incoherent regime, a characteristic minimum emerges in the mean first
passage time to reach an absorbing neighboring state whenever the intrinsic
time scale of the modulation matches the characteristic time scale of the
system dynamics. For the case of deterministic periodic driving, the first
passage time probability density function (pdf) displays a complex,
multi-peaked behavior, which depends crucially on the details of initial phase,
frequency, and strength of the driving. As an interesting feature we find that
the mean first passage time enters the resonant activation regime at a critical
frequency $\nu^*$ which depends very weakly on the strength of the driving.
Moreover, we provide the relation between the first passage time pdf and the

robots, there has been a resurgence of research interest into methods for
accurate system identification. An important class of methods focuses on the
inertial parameters of rigid-body systems. These parameters consist of the
mass, first mass moment (related to center of mass location), and rotational
inertia matrix of each link. The main contribution of this paper is to
formulate physical-consistency constraints on these parameters as Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMIs). The use of these constraints in identification can
accelerate convergence and increase robustness to noisy data. It is critically
observed that the proposed LMIs are expressed in terms of the covariance of the
mass distribution, rather than its rotational moments of inertia. With this
perspective, connections to the classical problem of moments in mathematics are
shown to yield new bounding-volume constraints on the mass distribution of each
link. While previous work ensured physical plausibility or used convex
optimization in identification, the LMIs here uniquely enable both advantages.
Constraints are applied to identification of a leg for the MIT Cheetah 3 robot.
Detailed properties of transmission components are identified alongside link
inertias, with parameter optimization carried out to global optimality through
semidefinite programming.

background (CMB) B-mode polarization anisotropy. This process of reducing the
gravitational-lensing generated B-mode component will become increasingly
important for improving searches for the B modes produced by primordial
gravitational waves. In this work, we delens B-mode maps constructed from
multi-frequency SPTpol observations of a 90 deg$^2$ patch of sky by subtracting
a B-mode template constructed from two inputs: SPTpol E-mode maps and a lensing
potential map estimated from the $\textit{Herschel}$ $500\,\mu m$ map of the
CIB. We find that our delensing procedure reduces the measured B-mode power
spectrum by 28% in the multipole range $300 < \ell < 2300$; this is shown to be
consistent with expectations from theory and simulations and to be robust
against systematics. The null hypothesis of no delensing is rejected at $6.9
\sigma$. Furthermore, we build and use a suite of realistic simulations to
study the general properties of the delensing process and find that the
delensing efficiency achieved in this work is limited primarily by the noise in
the lensing potential map. We demonstrate the importance of including realistic
experimental non-idealities in the delensing forecasts used to inform
instrument and survey-strategy planning of upcoming lower-noise experiments,

functional from available volume contributions. The nuclear equation of state
is based upon the relativistic density functional model DD2 with excluded

decomposed into mean scalar and vector components. The scalar interaction is
motivated by a string potential between quarks, whereas the vector interaction
potential is motivated by higher order interactions of quarks leading to an
increased stiffening at high densities. As an application, we consider matter

planetary systems hosting a HJ are approximately three times more likely to
have a stellar companion with a semimajor axis between 50 and 2000 AU, compared
to field stars. This correlation suggests that HJ formation is affected by the
stellar binary companion. A potential model is high-eccentricity migration, in
which the binary companion induces high-eccentricity Lidov-Kozai (LK)
oscillations in the proto-HJ orbit, triggering orbital migration driven by
tides. A pitfall of this `binary-LK' model is that the observed stellar
binaries hosting HJs are typically too wide to produce HJs in sufficient
numbers, because of suppression by short-range forces. We propose a
modification to the binary-LK model in which there is a second giant planet
orbiting the proto-HJ at a semimajor axis of several tens of AU. Such
companions are currently hidden to observations, but their presence could be
manifested by a propagation of the perturbation of the stellar binary companion
inwards to the proto-HJ, thereby overcoming the barrier imposed by short-range
forces. Our model does not require the planetary companion orbit to be
eccentric and/or inclined with respect to the proto-HJ, but its semimajor axis
should lie in a specific range given the planetary mass and binary semimajor
axis, and the inclination with respect to the binary should be near $40^\circ$
or $140^\circ$. Our prediction for planetary companions to HJs in stellar
binaries should be testable by future observations.

specific angular momentum of galaxies, $j_{\rm stars}$. We split mergers into:
dry (gas-poor)/wet (gas-rich), major/minor, and different spin alignments and
orbital parameters. Wet (dry) mergers have an average neutral gas-to-stellar
mass ratio of $1.1$ ($0.02$), while major (minor) mergers are those with
stellar mass ratios $\ge 0.3$ ($0.1-0.3$). We correlate the positions of
galaxies in the $j_{\rm stars}$-stellar mass plane at $z=0$ with their merger
history, and find that galaxies of low spins suffered dry mergers, while
galaxies of normal/high spins suffered predominantly wet mergers, if any. The
radial $j_{\rm stars}$ profiles of galaxies that went through dry mergers are
deficient by $\approx 0.3$~dex at $r\lesssim 10\,r_{50}$ (with $r_{50}$ being
the half-stellar mass radius), compared to galaxies that went through wet
mergers. Studying the merger remnants reveals that dry mergers reduce $j_{\rm
stars}$ by $\approx 30$\%, while wet mergers increase it by $\approx 10$\%, on
average. The latter is connected to the build-up of the bulge by newly formed
stars of high rotational speed. Moving from minor to major mergers accentuates
these effects. When the spin vectors of the galaxies prior to the dry merger
are misaligned, $j_{\rm stars}$ decreases to a greater magnitude, while in wet
mergers co-rotation and high orbital angular momentum efficiently spun-up
galaxies. We predict what would be the observational signatures in the $j_{\rm

profiles that rise beyond $\approx 10\,r_{50}$, both of which are significantly

temperature fluctuations from high-dynamic-range simulations for AGN-dominated
reionization histories that have been tested against available Lyman-alpha and
CMB data. We model AGN by extrapolating the observed M-sigma relation to high
redshifts and assign them ionizing emissivities consistent with recent UV
luminosity function measurements. We assess the observability of the predicted
spatial 21 cm fluctuations by ongoing and upcoming experiments in the late
stages of reionization in the limit in which the hydrogen 21 cm spin
temperature is significantly larger than the CMB temperature. Our AGN-dominated
reionization histories increase the variance of the 21 cm emission by a factor
of up to ten compared to similar reionization histories dominated by faint
galaxies, to values close to 100 mK^2 at scales accessible to experiments (k <
1 h/cMpc). This is lower than the sensitivity claimed to have been already
reached by ongoing experiments by only a factor of about two or less. When
reionization is dominated by AGN, the 21 cm power spectrum is enhanced on all
scales due to the enhanced bias of the clustering of the more massive haloes
and the peak in the large scale 21 cm power is strongly enhanced and moved to
larger scales due to bigger characteristic bubble sizes. AGN dominated
reionization should be easily detectable by LOFAR (and later HERA and SKA1) at
their design sensitivity, assuming successful foreground subtraction and
instrument calibration. Conversely, these could become the first non-trivial
reionization scenarios to be ruled out by 21 cm experiments, thereby
constraining the contribution of AGN to reionization.

cross-section is chosen, $\sigma$=10 $\rm cm^2/gr$, to amplify differences from
CDM models. Milky Way-like galaxies form a shallower DM density profile in SIDM
than they do in CDM, with differences already at 20 kpc scales. This
demonstrates that even for the most massive spirals the effect of SIDM
dominates over the adiabatic contraction due to baryons. Strikingly, the
dynamics of SMBHs differs in the SIDM and reference CDM case. SMBHs in massive
spirals have sunk to the centre of their host galaxy in both the SIDM and CDM
run, while in less massive galaxies about 80$\%$ of the SMBH population is
off-centered in the SIDM case, as opposed to the CDM case in which $\sim$90$\%$
of SMBHs have reached their host's centre. SMBHs are found as far as $\sim$9
kpc away from the centre of their host SIDM galaxy. This difference is due to
the increased dynamical friction timescale caused by the lower DM density in
SIDM galaxies compared to CDM, resulting in 'core stalling'. This pilot work
highlights the importance of simulating in a full hydrodynamical context
different DM models combined to SMBH physics to study their influence on galaxy
formation.

seems to be a (one sigma) preference for a normal ordered (NO) neutrino mass

significantly) non-maximal atmospheric mixing. Global fits for the NO case
yield lepton mixing angle one sigma ranges: $\theta_{23}\approx 41.4^\circ \pm

quasi-degenerate masses. Given such experimental advances, it seems an
opportune moment to review the theoretical status of attempts to explain such a

the four pillars of: {\em predictivity}, {\em minimality}, {\em robustness} and

by the removal of a molecular cloud's envelope by feedback from an external
source. Feedback from star formation has difficulties halting the process in
dense gas but can easily remove the less dense and warmer envelopes where star
formation does not occur. However, the envelopes can play an important role
keeping their host clouds bound by deepening the gravitational potential and
providing a constraining pressure boundary. We use numerical simulations to
show that removal of the cloud envelopes results in all cases in a fall in the
star formation efficiency (SFE). At 1.38 free-fall times our 4 pc cloud
simulation experienced a drop in the SFE from 16 to six percent, while our 5 pc
cloud fell from 27 to 16 per cent. At the same time, our 3 pc cloud (the least
bound) fell from an SFE of 5.67 per cent to zero when the envelope was lost.
The star formation efficiency per free-fall time varied from zero to $\approx$
0.25 according to $\alpha$, defined to be the ratio of the kinetic plus thermal
to gravitational energy, and irrespective of the absolute star forming mass
available. Furthermore the fall in SFE associated with the loss of the envelope
is found to even occur at later times. We conclude that the SFE will always
fall should a star forming cloud lose its envelope due to stellar feedback,
with less bound clouds suffering the greatest decrease.

be achieved without a proper quantification of the error induced by foreground
removal (or other systematics like 0-point photometry offset). Because these
errors are highly correlated on the sky, their influence is expected to be
especially important at very large scales. In this work we quantify how the
uncertainty in the visibility mask of a survey influences the measured power
spectrum of a sample of tracers of the density field and its covariance matrix.
We start from a very large set of 10,000 catalogs of dark matter halos in
periodic cosmological boxes, produced with the PINOCCHIO approximate method. To
make an analytic approach feasible, we assume luminosity-independent halo bias
and an idealized geometry for the visibility mask. We find that the power
spectrum of these biased tracers can be expressed as the sum of a cosmological
term, a mask term and a term involving their convolution. The mask and
convolution terms scale like $P\propto l^2\sigma_A^2$, where $\sigma_A^2$ is
the variance of the uncertainty on the visibility mask. With $l=30-100$ Mpc$/h$
and $\sigma_A=5-20$\%, the mask term can be significant at $k\sim0.01-0.1\
h/$Mpc, and the convolution term can amount to $\sim 1-10$\% of the total. For
the power spectrum covariance, the coupling of the convolution term with the
other two gives rise to several mixed terms, that we quantify by difference
using the mock catalogs. These are found to be of the same order of the mask
covariance, and to introduce non-diagonal terms at large scales. Then, the
power spectrum covariance matrix cannot be expressed as the sum of a
cosmological and of a mask term. Our results lie down the theoretical bases to
quantify the impact that uncertainties in the mask calibration have on the
derivation of cosmological constraints from large spectroscopic surveys.

they show more extreme emission-line properties, higher star formation rates,
lower masses, and smaller sizes. However, their faintness precludes studies of
their chemical abundances and ionization conditions, strongly limiting our
understanding of the physics driving early galaxy build-up and metal
enrichment. Here we study a rare population of UV-selected, sub$-L^{*}$(z=3)
galaxies at redshift 2.4$<z<$3.5 that exhibit all the rest-frame properties
expected from primeval galaxies. These low-mass, highly-compact systems are
rapidly-forming galaxies able to double their stellar mass in only few tens
million years. They are characterized by very blue UV spectra with weak
absorption features and bright nebular emission lines, which imply hard
radiation fields from young hot massive stars. Their highly-ionized gas phase
has strongly sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances, with metallicities more
than a factor of two lower than that found in typical galaxies of similar mass
and star formation rate at $z\lesssim$2.5. These young galaxies reveal an early
and short stage in the assembly of their galactic structures and their chemical
evolution, a vigorous phase which is likely to be dominated by the effects of
gas-rich mergers, accretion of metal-poor gas and strong outflows.

star formation rates (SFR($H\alpha$) $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{1}$ $M_{\odot}/yr$) and

of SFDGs shows a flatter slope compared to previous studies of galaxies in the

in the low mass range by varying specific SFRs and gas fractions amongst the
galaxies in our sample. Compared with simple chemical evolution models we find
that most SFDGs do not follow the predictions of a ""closed-box"" model, but
those from a gas regulating model in which gas flows are considered. While
strong stellar feedback may produce large-scale outflows favoring the cessation
of vigorous star formation and promoting the removal of metals, younger and
more metal-poor dwarfs may have recently accreted large amounts of fresh, very
metal-poor gas, that is used to fuel current star formation.

DC bus voltage stability when conventional droop control is used in DC

increases. Previous studies have suggested using secondary control utilizing
linear controllers to overcome drawbacks of droop control. However, linear
control design depends on an accurate model of the system. The derivation of
such a model is challenging because the noise and disturbances caused by the
coupling between sources, loads, and switches in microgrids are
under-represented. This under-representation makes linear modeling and control
insufficient. Hence, in this paper, we propose a robust adaptive control to
adjust droop characteristics to satisfy both current sharing and bus voltage
stability. First, the time-varying models of DC microgrids are derived. Second,
the improvements for the adaptive control method are presented. Third, the
application of the enhanced adaptive method to DC microgrids is presented to
satisfy the system objective. Fourth, simulation and experimental results on a

distributed resources and maintains the nominal bus voltage. Last, the
comparative study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method over the

and LOS. By FML, the endogeneity issues arisen from the dependence between
charge and LOS can be efficiently resolved. As an illustrative example, we
apply our method to real charge and LOS data sampled from New York State
Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System 2013 (SPARCS 2013). We
compare our fitting result with the fitting to the marginal LOS data generated
by the widely used Phase-Type model, and conclude that our method is more
efficient in fitting.

how to efficiently find such a simple schedule over line networks. Towards this

algorithm is to leverage similarities between network states in HD and edge
coloring in a graph. It is also shown that the algorithm allows to derive a

to solve hard optimization problems. Considerable progress has been made in the
development of a physical quantum annealer, motivating the study of methods to

annealing approach to measure similarity among molecular structures.
Implementing real-world problems on a quantum annealer is challenging due to
hardware limitations such as sparse connectivity, intrinsic control error, and
limited precision. In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem
must be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques. Using a real data set,
we investigate the performance of a quantum annealer in solving the molecular
similarity problem. We provide experimental evidence that common practices for
embedding can be replaced by new alternatives which mitigate some of the
hardware limitations and enhance its performance. Common practices for
embedding include minimizing either the number of qubits or the chain length,
and determining the strength of ferromagnetic couplers empirically. We show
that current criteria for selecting an embedding do not improve the hardware's
performance for the molecular similarity problem. Furthermore, we use a
theoretical approach to determine the strength of ferromagnetic couplers. Such
an approach removes the computational burden of the current empirical
approaches, and also results in hardware solutions that can benefit from simple
local classical improvement. Although our results are limited to the problems
considered here, they can be generalized to guide future benchmarking studies.

emit correlated gammas (e.g. Cf-252, Am-Be). This category includes a vast
majority of neutron sources important in nuclear threat search, safeguards and
non-proliferation. Rather than requiring multiple views of the source this
technique relies on the source's intrinsic property of coincidence gamma and
neutron emission. As a result only a single-view measurement of the source is
required to perform the 3D reconstruction. In principle, any scatter camera
sensitive to gammas and neutrons with adequate timing and interaction location
resolution can perform this reconstruction. Using a neutron double scatter
technique, we can calculate a conical surface of possible source locations. By
including the time to a correlated gamma we further constrain the source
location in three-dimensions by solving for the source-to-detector distance
along the surface of said cone. As a proof of concept we applied these
reconstruction techniques on measurements taken with the the Mobile Imager of
Neutrons for Emergency Responders (MINER). Two Cf-252 sources measured at 50

of chiral molecules on a spherical surface in the context of the assembly of
viral shells. We encounter two types of icosahedral solidification transitions.
The first type is a conventional first-order phase transition from the uniform
to the icosahedral state. It can be described by a single icosahedral spherical
harmonic of even $l$. The chiral pseudo-scalar term in the free energy creates
secondary terms with chiral character but it does not affect the thermodynamics
of the transition. The second type, associated with icosahedral spherical
harmonics with odd $l$, is anomalous. Pure odd $l$ icosahedral states are
unstable but stability is recovered if admixture with the neighboring $l+1$
icosahedral spherical harmonic is included, generated by the non-linear terms.
This is in conflict with the principle of Landau theory that symmetry-breaking
transitions are characterized by only a \textit{single} irreducible
representation of the symmetry group of the uniform phase and we argue that
this principle should be removed from Landau theory. The chiral term now
directly affects the transition because it lifts the degeneracy between two
isomeric mixed-$l$ icosahedral states. A direct transition is possible only
over a limited range of parameters. Outside this range, non-icosahedral states
intervene. For the important case of capsid assembly dominated by $l=15$, the
intervening states are found to be based on octahedral symmetry.

properties of the underlying regression problem. In particular, a) We establish

following ""all-or-nothing"" property. When n exceeds n^{*},
(2k)^{-1}\|\beta_{2}-\beta^*\|_0\approx 0, and when n is below n^{*},
(2k)^{-1}\|\beta_{2}-\beta^*\|_0\approx 1, where \beta_2 is the optimal

We compute the squared error for an intermediate problem
\min_{\beta}\|Y-X\beta\|_{2} where minimization is restricted to vectors \beta
with \|\beta-\beta^{*}\|_0=2k \zeta, for \zeta\in [0,1]. We show that a lower

  Representations Through The Lens of Pruning","30 pages, 36 figures, submission to ICLR 2017",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  How much can pruning algorithms teach us about the fundamentals of learning
representations in neural networks? And how much can these fundamentals help
while devising new pruning techniques? A lot, it turns out. Neural network
pruning has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many
different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. The decision
of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our
assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in
data. In this work, we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about
neural network learning representations, approaches to pruning and the
relevance of one in the context of the other. To accomplish this, we argue in
favor of pruning whole neurons as opposed to the traditional method of pruning
weights from optimally trained networks. We first review the historical
literature, point out some common assumptions it makes, and propose methods to
demonstrate the inherent flaws in these assumptions. We then propose our novel
approach to pruning and set about analyzing the quality of the decisions it
makes. Our analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held
assumptions behind pruning algorithms and the trade-offs we often make in the
interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a
straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70% of the neurons
in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and
without any re-training. It is to be noted here that the motivation behind this
work is not to propose an algorithm that would outperform all existing methods,
but to shed light on what some inherent flaws in these methods can teach us
about learning representations and how this can lead us to superior pruning
techniques.

The space of equivalent channels with input alphabet $X$ and output alphabet
$Y$ can be naturally endowed with the quotient of the Euclidean topology by the
equivalence relation. A topology on the space of equivalent channels with fixed
input alphabet $X$ and arbitrary but finite output alphabet is said to be
natural if and only if it induces the quotient topology on the subspaces of
equivalent channels sharing the same output alphabet. We show that every
natural topology is $\sigma$-compact, separable and path-connected. On the
other hand, if $|X|\geq 2$, a Hausdorff natural topology is not Baire and it is
not locally compact anywhere. This implies that no natural topology can be
completely metrized if $|X|\geq 2$. The finest natural topology, which we call
the strong topology, is shown to be compactly generated, sequential and $T_4$.
On the other hand, the strong topology is not first-countable anywhere, hence
it is not metrizable. We show that in the strong topology, a subspace is
compact if and only if it is rank-bounded and strongly-closed. We introduce a
metric distance on the space of equivalent channels which compares the noise
levels between channels. The induced metric topology, which we call the
noisiness topology, is shown to be natural. We also study topologies that are
inherited from the space of meta-probability measures by identifying channels
with their Blackwell measures. We show that the weak-* topology is exactly the
same as the noisiness topology and hence it is natural. We prove that if
$|X|\geq 2$, the total variation topology is not natural nor Baire, hence it is
not completely metrizable. Moreover, it is not locally compact anywhere.
Finally, we show that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra is the same for all Hausdorff

U_q(A_n^{(1)}) by a gauge transformation. We will show that a certain function
D^+_{\mu} intertwines with the transfer matrix and its space reversal. When
interpreting the transfer matrix as the transition matrix of a discrete-time
totally asymmetric particle system on the one-dimensional lattice Z, the
function D^+_{\mu} becomes a Markov duality function D_{\mu} which only depends
on q and the vertical spin parameters \mu_x. By considering degenerations in
the spectral parameter, the duality results also hold on a finite lattice with
closed boundary conditions, and for a continuous-time degeneration. This
duality function had previously appeared in a multi-species ASEP(q,j) process.
The proof here uses that the R-matrix intertwines with the co-product, but does
not explicitly use the Yang-Baxter equation.
  It will also be shown that the stochastic U_q(A_n^{(1)}) is a multi-species
version of a stochastic vertex model studied in \cite{BP,CP}. This will be done
by generalizing the fusion process of \cite{CP} and showing that it matches the
fusion of \cite{KRL} up to the gauge transformation.
  We also show, by direct computation, that the multi-species q-Hahn Boson
process (which arises at a special value of the spectral parameter) also
satisfies duality with respect to D_0, generalizing the single-species result

flow models. Efficiently coupling these models is vital for simulating the flow
and flooding of open channels. Currently, existing methods couple the models
either at the channel lateral boundaries (lateral methods) or at the location,
along the channel flow direction, where the two sub-domains intersect (frontal
methods). We classify these methods as horizontal methods since the coupling
points are on the horizontal plane. The limitations of these methods include
their inability to recover the 2D channel flow structure during flooding
without losing efficiency, and their inability to switch between lateral and
frontal methods, based on the problem. Here, we propose a new paradigm which is
to think of the channel flow as a two layer flow. This leads to the vertical
coupling method (VCM) which is able to recover 2D channel flow structure
without losing efficiency, switch types depending on the flow and is a superset
of some existing methods. The VCM is based on a user chosen elevation above
which the user considers the channel to be full. From this elevation, all other
flow quantities are defined including the two layers. The flows in the lower
and upper layers are assumed to be 1D and 2D respectively, and the appropriate
flow models with exchange terms are derived. The 2D shallow water flow model is
retained for the floodplains. Finite volume methods (FVM) are formulated for
the flood model; the FVM with the operator splitting approach are also
formulated to solve and couple the two layer channel flow models. We show that
the resulting method (i) is well-balanced (ii) preserves the ""no-numerical""
flooding property (iii) preserves conservation properties and (iv) adapts to
the flow situation.

Analog forecasting has been successful at producing robust forecasts for a
variety of ecological and physical processes. Analog forecasting is a
mechanism-free nonlinear method that forecasts a system forward in time by
examining how past states deemed similar to the current state moved forward.
Previous work on analog forecasting has typically been presented in an
empirical or heuristic context, as opposed to a formal statistical context. 2.
The model presented here extends the model-based analog method of McDermott and
Wikle (2016) by placing analog forecasting within a fully hierarchical
statistical frame- work. In particular, a Bayesian hierarchical
spatial-temporal Poisson analog forecasting model is formulated. 3. In
comparison to a Poisson Bayesian hierarchical model with a latent dynamical
spatio- temporal process, the hierarchical analog model consistently produced
more accurate forecasts. By using a Bayesian approach, the hierarchical analog
model is able to quantify rigorously the uncertainty associated with forecasts.

  Melbourne, Australia, 1994; degree awarded 1995",,,,"nlin.CD cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The chaotic phenomenon of intermittency is modeled by a simple map of the
unit interval, the Farey map. The long term dynamical behaviour of a point
under iteration of the map is translated into a spin system via symbolic
dynamics. Methods from dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics may
then be used to analyse the map, respectively the zeta function and the
transfer operator. Intermittency is seen to be problematic to analyze due to
the presence of an `indifferent fixed point'. Points under iteration of the map
move away from this point extremely slowly creating pathological convergence
times for calculations. This difficulty is removed by going to an appropriate
induced subsystem, which also leads to an induced zeta function and an induced
transfer operator. Results obtained there can be transferred back to the
original system. The main work is then divided into two sections. The first
demonstrates a connection between the induced versions of the zeta function and
the transfer operator providing useful results regarding the analyticity of the
zeta function. The second section contains a detailed analysis of the pressure
function for the induced system and hence the original by considering bounds on
the radius of convergence of the induced zeta function. In particular, the
asymptotic behaviour of the pressure function in the limit $\beta$, the inverse
of `temperature', tends to negative infinity is determined and the existence
and nature of a phase transition at $\beta=1$ is also discussed.

smooth cubic hypersurface $X$ over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic $\neq 2$, to problems on $1$-cycles on its variety of lines
$F(X)$. The first one relies on bitangent lines of $X$ and Tsen-Lang theorem.
It allows to prove that $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)$ is generated, via the action of the
universal $\mathbb P^1$-bundle over $F(X)$, by $\mathrm{CH}_1(F(X))$. When the
characteristic of the base field is $0$, we use that result to prove that if
$dim(X)\geq 7$, then $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)$ is generated by classes of planes
contained in $X$ and if $dim(X)\geq 9$, then $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)\simeq \mathbb
Z$. Similar results, with slightly weaker bounds, had already been obtained by
Pan. The second approach consists of an extension to subvarieties of $X$ of
higher dimension of an inversion formula developped by Shen in the case of
curves of $X$. This inversion formula allows to lift torsion cycles in
$\mathrm{CH}_2(X)$ to torsion cycles in $\mathrm{CH}_1(F(X))$. For complex
cubic $5$-folds, it allows to prove that the birational invariant provided by
the group $\mathrm{CH}^3(X)_{tors,AJ}$ of homologically trivial, torsion
codimension $3$ cycles annihilated by the Abel-Jacobi morphism is controlled by
the group $\mathrm{CH}_1(F(X))_{tors,AJ}$ which is a birational invariant of

Brownian particles can involve either translational or rotational motion. Here,
we report the translational dynamics of photon-activated gold nanoparticles

Under excitation of femtosecond (fs)-laser pulses, we observed that those
Brownian NPs exhibit a superfast diffusive behavior with a diffusion constant
four to five orders of magnitude greater than that in absence of laser
excitation. The measured diffusion constant was found to follow a power-law
dependence on the fs-laser fluence. Such superfast diffusion is induced by
strong random driving forces arising from rapid nucleation, expansion and
collapse of photoinduced nanobubbles (NBs) near the NP surface. In contrast,
the motion of the NPs exhibit superfast ballistic translation at a short time
scale down to nanoseconds (ns). Combining with physical model simulation, this
study reveals a NB-propulsion mechanism for the self-propulsive motion,
providing physical insights for better design of light-activated artificial

mainly contributing to the ongoing trend of wearables, smart vehicles, and home
automation systems. Voice assistants such as Siri, Google Now and Cortana, have
become our everyday fixtures, especially in scenarios where touch interfaces
are inconvenient or even dangerous to use, such as driving or exercising.
Nevertheless, the open nature of the voice channel makes voice assistants
difficult to secure and exposed to various attacks as demonstrated by security
researchers. In this paper, we present VAuth, the first system that provides
continuous and usable authentication for voice assistants. We design VAuth to
fit in various widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses,
earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of
the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the voice
assistant's microphone. VAuth guarantees that the voice assistant executes only
the commands that originate from the voice of the owner. We have evaluated
VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve an almost
perfect matching accuracy with less than 0.1% false positive rate, regardless
of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility.
VAuth successfully thwarts different practical attacks, such as replayed
attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also has low
energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most existing voice
assistants.

single chunk with regularized ELM approach for offline learning in case of
one-class classification (OCC). Further, the basic hyper plane model is adapted
in an online fashion from stream of training samples in this paper. Two
frameworks viz., boundary and reconstruction are presented to detect the target
class in online RKOC-ELM. Boundary framework based one-class classifier
consists of single node output architecture and classifier endeavors to
approximate all data to any real number. However, one-class classifier based on
reconstruction framework is an autoencoder architecture, where output nodes are
identical to input nodes and classifier endeavor to reconstruct input layer at
the output layer. Both these frameworks employ regularized kernel ELM based
online learning and consistency based model selection has been employed to
select learning algorithm parameters. The performance of online RK-OC-ELM has
been evaluated on standard benchmark datasets as well as on artificial datasets
and the results are compared with existing state-of-the art one-class
classifiers. The results indicate that the online learning one-class classifier
is slightly better or same as batch learning based approaches. As, base
classifier used for the proposed classifiers are based on the ELM, hence,
proposed classifiers would also inherit the benefit of the base classifier i.e.
it will perform faster computation compared to traditional autoencoder based
one-class classifier.

radius of nuclei is investigated in the framework of self-consistent Skyrme
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations. The continuum is treated appropriately by
the Green's function techniques. As an example the nucleus $^{124}$Zr is
treated for a varying strength of pairing correlations. We find that, as the
pairing strength increases, the neutron rms radius first shrinks, reaches a
minimum and beyond this point it expands again. The shrinkage is due to the the
so-called `pairing anti-halo effect', i. e. due to the decreasing of the
asymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing. However, in some
cases, increasing pairing correlations can also lead to an expansion of the
nucleus due to a growing occupation of so-called `halo' orbits, i.e. weakly
bound states and resonances in the continuum with low-$\ell $ values. In this
case, the neutron radii are extended just by the influence of pairing
correlations, since these `halo' orbits cannot be occupied without pairing. The
term `anti-halo effect' is not justified in such cases. For a full
understanding of this complicated interplay self-consistent calculations are
necessary.

based, which supports both types of learning viz., online and offline learning.
Out of various proposed methods, four are offline and remaining two are online

mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. Kernel feature mapping
based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of
one-class classifiers are tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and
RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a crucial factor in case
of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been employed so
far and analyses the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over
another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial datasets to check
there boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from
different discipline to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our
proposed classifiers exhibit better performance compared to ten traditional

controlling a parameter $V$ in the algorithm, the backpressure algorithm can
achieve an arbitrarily small utility optimality gap. However, this in turn
brings in a large queue length at each node and hence causes large network

best known utility-delay tradeoff for general networks is $[O(1/V), O(V)]$ and

chosen literals. Provided the constraint density satisfies $\Delta \gg 1$, such
an instance is unsatisfiable with high probability. The \emph{refutation}
problem is to efficiently find a proof of unsatisfiability.
  We show that whenever the predicate $P$ supports a $t$-\emph{wise uniform}
probability distribution on its satisfying assignments, the sum of squares
(SOS) algorithm of degree $d = \Theta(\frac{n}{\Delta^{2/(t-1)} \log \Delta})$
(which runs in time $n^{O(d)}$) \emph{cannot} refute a random instance of
$\mathrm{CSP}(P)$. In particular, the polynomial-time SOS algorithm requires
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{(t+1)/2})$ constraints to refute random instances of
CSP$(P)$ when $P$ supports a $t$-wise uniform distribution on its satisfying
assignments. Together with recent work of Lee et al. [LRS15], our result also
implies that \emph{any} polynomial-size semidefinite programming relaxation for
refutation requires at least $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{(t+1)/2})$ constraints.
  Our results (which also extend with no change to CSPs over larger alphabets)
subsume all previously known lower bounds for semialgebraic refutation of
random CSPs. For every constraint predicate~$P$, they give a three-way hardness
tradeoff between the density of constraints, the SOS degree (hence running
time), and the strength of the refutation. By recent algorithmic results of
Allen et al. [AOW15] and Raghavendra et al. [RRS16], this full three-way

possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight

the community membership for each user from user friendship links. However,
membership alone, without a complete profile of what a community is and how it
interacts with other communities, has limited applications. This motivates us
to consider systematically profiling the communities and thereby developing
useful community-level applications. In this paper, we for the first time
formalize the concept of community profiling. With rich user information on the
network, such as user published content and user diffusion links, we
characterize a community in terms of both its internal content profile and
external diffusion profile. The difficulty of community profiling is often
underestimated. We novelly identify three unique challenges and propose a joint
Community Profiling and Detection (CPD) model to address them accordingly. We
also contribute a scalable inference algorithm, which scales linearly with the
data size and it is easily parallelizable. We evaluate CPD on large-scale
real-world data sets, and show that it is significantly better than the
state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks.

with a focal length of 8 m focuses X-rays onto the detector, which consists of
a plastic scattering element surrounded by Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride detectors,
which absorb and record the scattered X-rays. Since X-rays preferentially
scatter perpendicular to their polarization direction, the polarization
properties of an X-ray beam can be inferred from the azimuthal distribution of
scattered X-rays. A close alignment of the X-ray focal spot with the center of
the detector is required in order to reduce systematic uncertainties and to
maintain a high photon detection efficiency. This places stringent requirements
on the mechanical and thermal stability of the telescope structure. During the

carbon chains with the cumulene structure ($=C=C=)_{n}$. With the aid of ab
initio simulations, based on the density functional theory, we have revealed
the phenomenon of the $\pi$-mode softening in a certain range of its amplitude
for the strain above the critical value $\eta_{c}\approx 11\,{\%}$.
Condensation of this soft mode induces the structural transformation of the
carbon chain with doubling of its unit cell. This is the Peierls phase
transition in the strained cumulene, which was previously revealed in [Nano
Lett. 14, 4224 (2014)]. The Peierls transition leads to appearance of the
energy gap in the electron spectrum of the strained carbyne, and this material
transforms from the conducting state to semiconducting or insulating states.
The authors of the above paper emphasize that such phenomenon can be used for
construction of various nanodevices. The $\pi$-mode softening occurs because
the old equilibrium positions (EQPs), around which carbon atoms vibrate at
small strains, lose their stability and these atoms begin to vibrate in the new
potential wells located near old EQPs. We study the stability of the new EQPs,
as well as stability of vibrations in their vicinity. In previous paper
[Physica D 203, 121(2005)], we proved that only three symmetry-determined
Rosenberg nonlinear normal modes can exist in monoatomic chains with arbitrary
interparticle interactions. They are the above-discussed $\pi$-mode and two
other modes, which we call $\sigma$-mode and $\tau$-mode. These modes
correspond to the multiplication of the unit cell of the vibrational state by
two, three or four times compared to that of the equilibrium state. We study
properties of these modes in the chain model with arbitrary pair potential of
interparticle interactions.

energy-dependent loss. The resulting thermal reservoir may then be coupled to a
broad class of Hamiltonian systems to produce low-entropy quantum phases. We
present an idealized picture of such a reservoir, deriving the scaling of
reservoir entropy with system parameters, and then propose several practical
implementations using only standard circuit quantum electrodynamics tools, and
extract the fundamental performance limits. Finally, we explore, both
analytically and numerically, the coupling of such a thermalizer to the
paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard chain, where we employ it to stabilize an $n=1$ Mott
phase. In this case, the performance is limited by the interplay of dynamically
arrested thermalization of the Mott insulator and finite heat capacity of the
thermalizer, characterized by its repumping rate. This work explores a new

for labelled Markov chains, and relates this new concept to the known notion of

latter notion induces a tight upper bound on the approximation between
finite-horizon traces, as expressed by a total variation distance. As such,
this work extends corresponding results for exact notions and analogous results
for non-probabilistic models. This bound can be employed to relate the
closeness in satisfaction probabilities over bounded linear-time properties,
and allows for probabilistic model checking of concrete models via
abstractions. The contribution focuses on both finite-state and
uncountable-state labelled Markov chains, and claims two main applications:
firstly, it allows an upper bound on the trace distance to be decided for

pair of complete graphs has at most one common vertex, then the chromatic

degree greater than 1, then $G$ is $n$-colorable.

certain physical facts, such as pattern formation, autocatalytic chemical
reactions and population dynamics. The Schnakenberg, Gray-Scott and Brusselator
models are special cases of reaction-diffusion systems considered as numerical
examples in this paper. For numerical purposes, Crank-Nicolson formulae are
used for the time discretization and the resulting system is linearized by
Taylor expansion. In the finite element method, a uniform partition of the
solution domain is constructed for the space discretization. Over the mentioned
mesh, dirac-delta function and trigonometric quintic B-spline functions are
chosen as the weighted function and the bases functions, respectively. Thus,
the reaction-diffusion system turns into an algebraic system which can be
represented by a matrix equation so that the coeffcients are block matrices
containing a certain number of non-zero elements in each row. The method is
tested on different problems. To illustrate the accuracy, error norms are
calculated in the linear problem whereas the relative error is given in other
nonlinear problems. Subject to the character of the nonlinear problems, the
occurring spatial patterns are formed by the trajectories of the dependent
variables. The degree of the base polynomial allows the method to be used in
high-order differential equation solutions. The algorithm produces accurate
results even when the time increment is larger. Therefore, the proposed
Trigonometric Quintic B-spline Collocation method is an effective method which
produces acceptable results for the solutions of reaction-diffusion systems.

Specifically, our perturbation theory models combine a diagonal and

manifold. We benchmark all proposed models as well as an \textit{a posteriori}
linearized coupled cluster correction on top of AP1roG against CR-CCSD(T)

extrapolated to the basis set limit. Moreover, we test the performance of our
new methods for multiple bond breaking processes in the N$_2$, C$_2$, and BN

indicate that the best performance is obtained from a linearized coupled

identified with that of their lepton numbers. As a result, both bilinear and
trilinear `$R$-parity violating' (RPV) terms could be present at the
superpotential. However, $R$-symmetry is not an exact symmetry as it is broken
by supergravity effects. Hence, sneutrinos acquire a small vacuum expectation
value in this framework. However, a suitable choice of basis ensures that the
bilinear RPV terms can be completely rotated away from the superpotential and
the scalar potential. On the other hand, the trilinear terms play a very
crucial role in generating neutrino masses and mixing at the tree level. This
is noticeably different from the typical $R$-parity violating Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. Also, gravitino mass turns out to be the order
parameter of $R$-breaking and is directly related to the neutrino mass. We show
that such a gravitino, within the mass range $200~\text{keV}\lesssim

involving sustainable alternative energy systems. During the design of such

solar insolation and ambient temperature fluctuations) when their system
interacts with the environment. In this chapter, the sizing and design
optimization of the solar powered irrigation system was considered. This
problem is multivariate, noisy, nonlinear and multiobjective. This design
problem was tackled by first using the Fuzzy Type II approach to model the
noise factors. Consequently, the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) (in the
context of a weighted sum framework) was employed to solve this multiobjective
fuzzy design problem. This method was then used to construct the approximate
Pareto frontier as well as to identify the best solution option in a fuzzy
setting. Comprehensive analyses and discussions were performed on the generated
numerical results with respect to the implemented solution methods.

transfer processes for quantum open systems. Focusing on typical systems such
as the exact solvable damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the general spin-boson
model, we establish quantitative links between the time-resolved energy current
and the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum Fisher information (SLD-QFI)
flow, one of measures quantifying the non-Markovianity, within the framework of
non-Markovian master equations in time-local forms. From the relationships, we
find in the damped Jaynes-Cummings model that the SLD-QFI backflow from the
reservoir to the system always correlates with an energy backflow, thus we can
directly witness the non-Markovianity from the dynamics of the energy current.
In the spin-boson model, the relation is built on the rotating-wave
approximation, calibrated against exact numerical results, and proven reliable
in the weak coupling regime. We demonstrate that whether the non-Markovianity
guarantees the occurrence of an energy backflow depends on the bath spectral
function. For the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic cases, we show that no energy backflow
occurs and the energy current always flow out of the system even in the
non-Markovian regime. While in the super-Ohmic case, we observe that the
non-Markovian dynamics can induce an energy backflow.

alternative CDM candidate. We consider cold and collisionless ULALPs produced

of CDM. The ULALP fluid is commonly described by classical field equations.
However, we show that, like QCD axions, the ULALPs thermalize by gravitational
self-interactions and form a Bose-Einstein condensate, a quantum phenomenon.
ULALPs, like QCD axions, explain the observational evidence for caustic rings
of dark matter because they thermalize and go to the lowest energy state
available to them. This is one of rigid rotation on the turnaround sphere. By
studying the heating effect of infalling ULALPs on galactic disk stars and the
thickness of the nearby caustic ring as observed from a triangular feature in
the IRAS map of our galactic disk, we obtain lower-mass bounds on the ULALP

efficiency of sound-proof approaches in this astrophysically relevant regime,
this paper clarifies the conditions for a safe application. The potential of
the alternative pseudo-incompressible approximation is investigated, which in
contrast to the anelastic approximation is shown to never break down for
predicting the point of marginal stability. Its accuracy, however, decreases
close to the parameters corresponding to the failure of the anelastic approach,
which is shown to occur when the sound-crossing time of the domain exceeds a
rotation time scale, i.e. for rotational Mach numbers greater than one.
Concerning the supercritical case, which is naturally characterised by smaller
rotational Mach numbers, we find that the anelastic approximation does not show
unphysical behaviour. Growth rates computed with the linearised anelastic
equations converge toward the corresponding fully compressible values as the
Rayleigh number increases. Likewise, our fully nonlinear turbulent simulations,
produced with our fully compressible and anelastic models and carried out in a

good agreement. However, this nonlinear test example is for only a moderately

simulated annealing (SA) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The study showed the
D-Wave 2X to be up to 100 million times faster than the classical algorithms.
The Google inputs are designed to demonstrate the value of collective
multiqubit tunneling, a resource available to D-Wave QPUs but not to simulated
annealing. But the computational hardness in these inputs is highly localized
in gadgets, with only a small amount of complexity coming from global
interactions, meaning that the relevance to real-world problems is limited.
  In this study we provide a new synthetic problem class that addresses the
limitations of the Google inputs while retaining their strengths. We use simple
clusters instead of more complex gadgets and more emphasis is placed on
creating computational hardness through frustrated global interactions like
those seen in interesting real-world inputs. The logical problems used to
generate these inputs can be solved in polynomial time [J. Phys. A, 15:10
(1982)]. However, for general heuristic algorithms that are unaware of the
planted problem class, the frustration creates meaningful difficulty in a
controlled environment ideal for study.
  We use these inputs to evaluate the new 2000-qubit D-Wave QPU. We include the
HFS algorithm---the best performer in a broader analysis of Google inputs---and
we include state-of-the-art GPU implementations of SA and QMC. The D-Wave QPU
solidly outperforms the software solvers: when we consider pure annealing time
(computation time), the D-Wave QPU reaches ground states up to 2600 times

from challenging multimodal inputs, the D-Wave QPU holds a similar advantage as
quantum sampling bias does not seem significant.

study the dynamics of the stellar binaries at galactic center, perturbed by
another distant SMBH. Geometrically, such a four-body system is supposed to be
decomposed into the inner triple (SMBH-star-star) and the outer triple
(SMBH-stellar binary-SMBH). We survey the parameter space and determine the
criteria analytically for the stellar mergers and the tidal disruption events
(TDEs). For a relative distant and equal masses SMBH binary, the stars have
more opportunities to merge as a result from the Lidov-Kozai(LK) oscillations
in the inner triple. With a sample of tight stellar binaries, our numerical
experiments reveal that a significant fraction of the binaries, ~70 per cent,
experience merger eventually. Whereas the majority of the stellar TDEs are
likely to occur at a close periapses to the SMBH, induced by the outer Kozai
effect. The tidal disruptions are found numerically as many as ~10 per cent for
a close SMBH binary that is enhanced significantly than the one without the

orbit (>=40 degree) relatively to the inner orbital plane and may lead to a
burst of the extremely astronomical events associated with the detection of the

the quantum architecture and circuits required at each node to run the
algorithm on a quantum repeater network. Our optimization techniques have
reduced the quantum circuit depth by 44\% and the number of qubits in each node
by 20\% for a minimum five-node setup compared to the design based on the
standard arithmetic circuits. These improvements lead to an architecture with
$KQ \approx 1.3 \times 10^{5}$ per node and error threshold $1.1 \times
10^{-6}$ for the total nodes in the network. The evaluation of the designed
architecture shows that to execute the algorithm once on the minimum setup, we
need to successfully distribute a total of 648 Bell pairs across the network,
spread evenly between all pairs of nodes. This framework can be considered a
starting point for establishing a road-map for light-weight demonstration of a
distributed quantum application on quantum repeater networks.

matter source. We start by reviewing the early model by Bardeen where the
metric is regularized by-hand through a short-distance cut-off, which is
justified in terms of non-linear electro-dynamical effects. This a toy-model
model useful to point-out the common features shared by all regular
semi-classical black holes. Then, we solve Einstein equations with a Gaussian
source encoding the quantum spread of an elementary particle. We identify, the
a priori arbitrary, Gaussian width with the Compton wavelength of the quantum
particle. This Compton-Gauss model leads to the estimate of a terminal density
that a gravitationally collapsed object can achieve. We identify this density
to be the Planck density, and reformulate the Gaussian model assuming this as
its peak density. All these models, are physically reliable as long as the
black hole mass is big enough with respect to the Planck mass. In the truly
Planckian regime, the semi-classical approximation breaks down. In this case, a
fully quantum black hole description is needed. In the last part of this paper,
we propose a non-geometrical quantum model of Planckian black hole implementing
the Holographic Principle and realizing the ""classicalization"" scenario
recently introduced by Dvali and collaborators. The classical relation between
the mass and radius of the black hole emerges only in the classical limit, far
away from the Planck scale.

main-sequence turnoff star, the abundance determination of P and S are the
first published determinations. The LTE profiles of the lines were fitted to
the observed spectra. Wherever possible, we corrected the derived abundances
for non-LTE effects. Three-dimensional (3D) CO5BOLD model atmospheres have been
used to determine the abundances of C and O from molecular CH and OH bands. The
abundances of these light elements in HD 84937 are found to agree well with the
abundances in classical metal-poor stars. Our HD 84937 carbon abundance
determination points toward a solar (or mildly enhanced) value of [C/Fe]. The
modest overabundance of the alpha elements of even atomic number Z, typical of
halo turnoff stars, is confirmed in this example. The odd-Z element P is found
to be somewhat deficient in HD 84937, at [P/Fe]=-0.32, which is again
consistent with the handful of existing determinations for turnoff stars of
such low metallicity. We show that the abundance of oxygen, deduced from the OH
band from 3D computations, is not compatible with the abundance deduced from
the red oxygen triplet. This incompatibility is explained by the existence of a
chromosphere heating the shallow layers of the atmosphere where the OH band, in
3D computations, is mainly formed. The abundance ratios are compared to the

universes (i.e. list arithmetic pretoposes; AUs), is shown to give rise to
base-independent results of Grothendieck toposes, provided the base elementary
topos has a natural numbers object.
  Categories of strict models of contexts $T$ in AUs are acted on strictly on
the left by non-strict AU-functors and strictly on the right by context maps,
and the actions combine in a strict action of a Gray tensor product.
  Any context extension $T_0 \subset T_1$ gives rise to a bundle. For each
point of $T_0$ - a model $M$ of $T_0$ in an elementary topos $S$ with nno - its
fibre is a generalized space, the classifying topos $S[T_1/M]$ for the
geometric theory $T_1/M$ of $T_1$-models restricting to $M$. This construction
is ""geometric"" in the sense that for any geometric morphism $f: S' \to S$, the
classifier $S'[T_1/f^\ast M]$ is got by pseudopullback of $S[T_1/M]$ along $f$.
  This is treated in a fibrational way by considering a 2-category GTop of
Grothendieck toposes (bounded geometric morphisms) fibred (as bicategory) over
a 2-category of elementary toposes with nno, geometric morphisms, and natural
isomorphisms. The notion of classifying topos as representing object for a
split fibration is then fibred over variable base using fibrations ""locally
representable"" over a second fibration.

asynchronous communication among large sets of geographically distributed
nodes. Yet, preserving privacy represents a major limitation for the wide
adoption of CBR, notably when the routers are located in public clouds. Indeed,
a CBR router must see the content of the messages sent by data producers, as
well as the filters (or subscriptions) registered by data consumers. This
represents a major deterrent for companies for which data is a key asset, as
for instance in the case of financial markets or to conduct sensitive
business-to-business transactions. While there exists some techniques for
privacy-preserving computation, they are either prohibitively slow or too
limited to be usable in real systems. In this paper, we follow a different
strategy by taking advantage of trusted hardware extensions that have just been
introduced in off-the-shelf processors and provide a trusted execution
environment. We exploit Intel's new software guard extensions (SGX) to
implement a CBR engine in a secure enclave. Thanks to the hardware-based
trusted execution environment (TEE), the compute-intensive CBR operations can
operate on decrypted data shielded by the enclave and leverage efficient
matching algorithms. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that SGX adds only
limited overhead to insecure plaintext matching outside secure enclaves while
providing much better performance and more powerful filtering capabilities than
alternative software-only solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
the first to demonstrate the practical benefits of SGX for privacy-preserving
CBR.

some V-type asteroids have been discovered far from the Vesta family supporting
the hypothesis of the presence of multiple basaltic asteroids in the early

the models of the radial extent and the variability of the temperature

asteroids using near-infrared colors of ~40000 asteroids observed by the
VHS-VISTA survey and compiled in the MOVIS-C catalogue. We also want to study
their near-infrared colors and to study the near-infrared color distribution of
the Vesta dynamical family. We performed a search in the MOVIS-C catalogue of
all the asteroids with (Y-J) and (J-Ks) in the range (Y-J) > 0.5 and (J-Ks) <
0.3, associated with V-type asteroids, and studied their color distribution. We
have also analyzed the near-infrared color distribution of 273 asteroid members
of the Vesta family and compared them with the albedo and visible colors from
WISE and SDSS data. We determined the fraction of V-type asteroids in the
family. We found 477 V-type candidates in MOVIS-C, 244 of them outside the
Vesta dynamical family. We identified 19 V-type asteroids beyond the 3:1 mean
motion resonance, 6 of them in the outer main belt, and 16 V-types in the inner
main belt with proper inclination i_p < 3.0deg, well below the inclination of
the Vesta family. We computed that ~85% of the members of the Vesta dynamical

transform operator, denoted by $\mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}$ is given by the
integral operator defined on $L^2(0,1)$ with kernel $K_{\alpha}(x,y)= \sqrt{c
xy} J_{\alpha}(cxy).$ To the operator $\mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha},$ we associate a
positive, self-adjoint compact integral operator $\mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}=c\,
\mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}\, \mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}.$ Note that the integral
operators $\mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}$ and $\mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}$ commute with a
Sturm-Liouville differential operator $\mathcal D_c^{\alpha}.$
  In this paper, we first give some useful estimates and bounds of the
eigenfunctions $\vp$ of $\mathcal H_c^{\alpha}$ or $\mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}.$
These estimates and bounds are obtained by using some special techniques from
the theory of Sturm-Liouville operators, that we apply to the differential
operator $\mathcal D_c^{\alpha}.$ If
  $(\mu_{n,\alpha}(c))_n$ and $\lambda_{n,\alpha}(c)=c\, |\mu_{n,\alpha}(c)|^2$
denote the infinite and countable sequence of the eigenvalues of the operators
$\mathcal{H}_c^{(\alpha)}$ and $\mathcal Q_c^{\alpha},$ arranged in the
decreasing order of their magnitude, then we show an unexpected result that for
a given integer $n\geq 0,$ $\lambda_{n,\alpha}(c)$ is decreasing with respect
to the parameter $\alpha.$ As a consequence, we show that for $\alpha\geq
\frac{1}{2},$ the $\lambda_{n,\alpha}(c)$ and the $\mu_{n,\alpha}(c)$ have a
super-exponential decay rate. Also, we give a lower decay rate of these
eigenvalues. As it will be seen, the previous results are essential tools for
the analysis of a spectral approximation scheme based on the eigenfunctions of
the finite Hankel transform operator. Some numerical examples will be provided
to illustrate the results of this work.

simulation. Near the critical thermal forcing (Rayleigh number $Ra$),
convection onsets as thermal Rossby waves, but as the $Ra$ increases, this
state is superceded by one dominated by advection. At moderate rotation, these
states (here called the weak branch and strong branch, respectively) are
smoothly connected. As the planetary core rotates faster, the smooth transition
is replaced by hysteresis cycles and subcriticality until the weak branch
disappears entirely and the strong branch onsets in a turbulent state at $Ek <
10^{-6}$. Here the strong branch persists even as the thermal forcing drops
well below the linear onset of convection ($Ra=0.7Ra_{crit}$ in this study). We
highlight the importance of the Reynolds stress, which is required for
convection to subsist below the linear onset. In addition, the P\'eclet number
is consistently above 10 in the strong branch. We further note the presence of
a strong zonal flow that is nonetheless unimportant to the convective state.
Our study suggests that, in the asymptotic regime of rapid rotation relevant
for planetary interiors, thermal convection of liquid metals in a sphere onsets

query compilation is that of identifying pertinent classes of queries whose

fields. Our computations span three orders of magnitude in radius, extend all
the way to the pole, and are evolved for more than one viscous time over the
inner decade in radius. Static mesh refinement is used to properly resolve MRI.
We find that:(1) inward accretion occurs mostly in the upper magnetically
dominated regions of the disk, similar to the predictions from some previous
analytical work and the ""coronal accretion"" in previous GRMHD simulations.
Rapid inflow in the upper layers combined with slow outflow at the midplane
creates strong $R\phi$ and $z\phi$ stresses in the mean field; the vertically
integrated $\alpha\sim 0.5-1$ when the initial field has $\beta_{0}=10^3$ at
the midplane. (2) A quasi-static global field geometry is established in which
flux transport by inflows at the surface is balanced by turbulent diffusion.
The field is strongly pinched inwards at the surface. A steady-state
advection-diffusion model, with turbulent magnetic Prandtl number of order
unity, reproduces this geometry well. (3) Weak unsteady disk winds are launched
at $z/R\sim1$ with the Alfven radius $R_{A}/R_{0}\sim3$. Although the wind is
episodic, the time averaged properties are well described by steady wind
theory. Wind is not efficient at transporting angular momentum. Even with
$\beta_{0}=10^3$, only 5% of the angular momentum transport is driven by torque
from the wind, and the wind mass flux from the inner decade of radius is only
$\sim$ 0.4% of the mass accretion rate. With weaker fields or thinner disks,
the wind contributes even less. (4) Most of the disk accretion is driven by the
$R\phi$ stress from the MRI and global magnetic fields. Our simulations have
many applications to astrophysical accretion disk systems.

N-light-pulse atom interferometers. We consider atomic interferometers based on
two-photon transitions (Raman transitions or Bragg pulses). Starting from the
exact analytical phase shift formula obtained from the atom optics ABCD
formalism, we use a power series expansion in time of the position of the
atomic wave packet with respect to the initial condition. The result of this
expansion leads to a formulation of the interferometer phase shift where the
leading coefficient in the phase terms up to T^k dependences (k >= 0) in the
time separation T between pulses, can be simply expressed in terms of a product
between a Vandermonde matrix, and a vector characterizing the two-photon pulse
sequence of the interferometer. This simple coefficient dependence of the phase
shift reflects very well the atom interferometer's sensitivity to a specific
inertial field in the presence of multiple gravito-inertial effects.
Consequently,we show that this formulation is well suited when looking for
selective atomic sensors of accelerations, rotations, or photon recoil only,
which can be obtained by simply zeroing some specific coefficients. We give a
theoritical application of our formulation to the photon recoil measurement.

might help to revolutionise physics. For example, laboratory tests (such as
those anticipated in nanomechanical or biological systems) may look to rule out
macroscopic realism: the idea that the properties of macroscopic objects exist
objectively and can be non-invasively measured. Such investigations are likely
to suffer from i) stringent experimental requirements, ii) marginal statistical
significance and iii) logical loopholes. We address all of these problems by
refining two tests of macroscopic realism, or `quantum witnesses', and
implementing them in a microscopic test on a photonic qubit and qutrit. The
first witness heralds the invasiveness of a blind measurement; its maximum
violation has been shown to grow with the dimensionality of the system under
study. The second witness heralds the invasiveness of a generic quantum
operation, and can achieve its maximum violation in any dimension -- it
therefore allows for the highest quantum signal-to-noise ratio and most
significant refutation of the classical point of view.

on multi-sequential WA that are defined as finite unions of sequential WA. The
problem we address is to minimize the size of this union. We call this minimum
the degree of sequentiality of (the relation realized by) the WA. For a given
positive integer k, we provide multiple characterizations of relations realized
by a union of k sequential WA over an infinitary finitely generated group: a
Lipschitz-like machine independent property, a pattern on the automaton (a new
twinning property) and a subclass of cost register automata. When possible, we
effectively translate a WA into an equivalent union of k sequential WA. We also
provide a decision procedure for our twinning property for commutative
computable groups thus allowing to compute the degree of sequentiality. Last,
we show that these results also hold for word transducers and that the

torsion. We use two absorption spectrometers in Kharkiv and Lille to measure
the rotational spectra over 45--630 GHz. The analysis is carried out using the
Rho-axis method and the RAM36 code. We search for N-methylformamide toward the
hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2) using a spectral line survey carried out with
ALMA. The astronomical results are put into a broader astrochemical context
with the help of a gas-grain chemical kinetics model. The laboratory data set
for the trans conformer of CH3NHCHO consists of 9469 line frequencies with J <=
62, including the first assignment of the rotational spectra of the first and
second excited torsional states. All these lines are fitted within experimental
accuracy. We report the tentative detection of CH3NHCHO towards Sgr B2(N2). We
find CH3NHCHO to be more than one order of magnitude less abundant than NH2CHO,
a factor of two less abundant than CH3NCO, but only slightly less abundant than
CH3CONH2. The chemical models indicate that the efficient formation of HNCO via
NH + CO on grains is a necessary step in the achievement of the observed
gas-phase abundance of CH3NCO. Production of CH3NHCHO may plausibly occur on
grains either through the direct addition of functional-group radicals or
through the hydrogenation of CH3NCO. Provided the detection of CH3NHCHO is
confirmed, the only slight underabundance of this molecule compared to its more
stable structural isomer acetamide and the sensitivity of the model abundances
to the chemical kinetics parameters suggest that the formation of these two
molecules is controlled by kinetics rather than thermal equilibrium.

moons (moonlets) embedded in Saturn's rings which cause S-shaped density
structures in their close vicinity, called propellers (Spahn and Sremcevic
2000; Tiscareno et al. 2006; Sremcevic et al. 2007). Here, we present
isothermal hydrodynamic simulations of moonlet-induced propellers in Saturn's A
ring which denote a further development of the original model (Spahn and
Sremcevic 2000). We find excellent agreement between these new hydrodynamic and
corresponding N-body simulations. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic simulations
confirm the predicted scaling laws (Spahn and Sremcevic 2000) and the
analytical solution for the density in the propeller gaps (Sremcevic et al.
2002). Finally, this mean field approach allows us to simulate the pattern of
the giant propeller Bleriot, which is too large to be modeled by direct N-body
simulations. Our results are compared to two stellar occultation observations
by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS), that intersect the
propeller Bleriot. Best fits to the UVIS optical depth profiles are achieved
for a Hill radius of 590 m, which implies a moonlet diameter of about 860 m.
Furthermore, the model favours a kinematic shear viscosity of the surrounding
ring material of $\nu_0 = 340$ cm^2/s, a dispersion velocity in the range of
0.3 cm/s $< c_0 <$ 1.5 cm/s, and a fairly high bulk viscosity $7 < \xi_0/\nu_0
< 17$. These large transport values might be overestimated by our isothermal
ring model and should be reviewed by an extended model including thermal
fluctuations.

quantum chemistry and first-principle simulation for condensed matter physics

medium-size, molecular system cannot be estimated numerically within chemical
accuracy (typically 1 kcal/mol or 1 mHa), it is considered that the energy
difference between two configurations of the same system can be computed in
practice within the desired accuracy.
  The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative study of
discretization error cancellation. The latter is the error component due to the
fact that the model used in the calculation (e.g. Kohn-Sham LDA) must be
discretized in a finite basis set to be solved by a computer. We first report
comprehensive numerical simulations performed with Abinit on two simple
chemical systems, the hydrogen molecule on the one hand, and a system
consisting of two oxygen atoms and four hydrogen atoms on the other hand. We
observe that errors on energy differences are indeed significantly smaller than
errors on energies, but that these two quantities asymptotically converge at
the same rate when the energy cut-off goes to infinity. We then analyze a
simple one-dimensional periodic Schr\""odinger equation with Dirac potentials,
for which analytic solutions are available. This allows us to explain the
discretization error cancellation phenomenon on this test case with
quantitative mathematical arguments.

formation efficiency on the order of 50$\%$ and an outflow duty cycle on the
order of 5$\%$. Entrainment efficiency, as probed by
$F_{\mathrm{CO}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}$, is also invariant with source
properties and evolutionary stage. The median value (6.3\kms{}) suggests an
entrainment efficiency of between 30 and 60$\%$ if the wind is launched at
$\sim$1AU. $L$[O\,{\sc i}] is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ but
not with $M_{\mathrm{env}}$, while low-$J$ CO is more closely correlated with
the latter than the former. This suggests that [O\,{\sc i}] traces the
present-day accretion activity while CO traces time-averaged accretion over the
dynamical timescale of the outflow. $L$[O\,{\sc i}] does not vary from Class 0
to Class I, unlike CO and H$_{2}$O. This is likely due to the ratio of atomic
to molecular gas in the wind increasing as the source evolves, balancing out
the decrease in mass accretion rate. Infall signatures are detected in
HCO$^{+}$ and H$_{2}$O in a few sources.

Ultrafast electronic photoexcitation of a diamond surface and subsequent

experimentally - for the first time. After photoexcitation on the rising edge
of the pulse, transient surface metallization was found to occur for laser
intensity near 18 TW/cm$^2$ due to enhancement of the impact ionization rate;
in this regime, the dielectric constant of the photoexcited diamond becomes
negative in the trailing edge of the pulse thereby increasing the efficacy with
which surface roughness leads to inhomogeneous energy absorption at the SPP
wave-vector. These transient SPP waves imprint permanent fine and coarse
surface ripples oriented perpendicularly to the laser polarization. The
theoretical modeling is supported by the experiments on the generation of
laser-induced periodic surface structure on diamond surface with normally
incident 515-nm, 200-fs laser pulses. Sub-wavelength ($\Lambda \approx 100$ nm)
and near wavelength ($\Lambda \approx 450$ nm) surface ripples oriented
perpendicularly to the laser polarization emerged within the ablative craters

ripples decrease with the increasing exposure following known cumulative
trends. The comparison between experimental data and theoretical predictions
makes evident the role of transient changes of the dielectric permittivity of
diamond during the initial stage of periodic surface ripple formation upon

double-staged mechanism. On the first stage the coagulation of cold particles
in the vortex cores leads to melting of their fusion product, which acquires a
spherical shape due to surface tension. Then (second stage) when these
particles reach a certain size they do not possess sufficient energy to melt
and eventually coalesce into the nanowires. Nevertheless the assumption of
melting for such refractory metal as tungsten, especially in He II, which
possesses an extremely high thermal conductivity, induces natural skepticism.
That is why we decided to register directly the visible thermal emission
accompanying metals coagulation in He II. The brightness temperatures of this
radiation for the tungsten, molybdenum, and platinum coagulation were found to
be noticeably higher than even the metals' melting temperatures. The region of
He II that contained suspended metal particles expanded with the velocity of 50
m/s, being close to the Landau velocity, but coagulation took place even more
quickly, so that the whole process of nanowire growth is completed at distances
about 1.5 mm from the place of metal injection into He II. High rate of
coagulation of guest metal particles as well as huge local overheating are
associated with them concentrating in quantized vortex cores. The same process
should take place not only for metals but for any atoms, molecules and small

In this work, we investigate the optimization of synchronizability in multiplex

finding is to show the conditions under which the efficiency of convergence to
the most optimal structure is almost as good as the case where both layers are
rewired during an optimization process. In particular, inter-layer coupling
strength responsible for the integration between the layers turns out to be
crucial factor governing the efficiency of optimization even for the cases when
the layer going through the evolution has nodes interacting much weakly than
those in the fixed layer. Additionally, we investigate the dependency of
synchronizability on the rewiring probability which governs the network
structure from a regular lattice to the random networks. The efficiency of the
optimization process preceding evolution driven by the optimization process is
maximum when the fixed layer has regular architecture, whereas the optimized
network is more synchronizable for the fixed layer having the rewiring
probability lying between the small-world transition and the random structure.

beneficial. How can a robot learn these local abstractions without a teacher?
More specifically, how can it decide from where and when to start learning a
new abstraction? A recently proposed algorithm called Curious Dr. MISFA
addresses this problem. The algorithm is based on two underlying learning
principles called artificial curiosity and slowness. The former is used to make
the robot self-motivated to explore by rewarding itself whenever it makes
progress learning an abstraction; the later is used to update the abstraction
by extracting slowly varying components from raw sensory inputs. Curious Dr.

certain situations. This paper presents a significant improvement that is
applicable to continuous environments, is computationally less expensive,
simpler to use with fewer hyper parameters, and stable in certain

investigate some of the consequences of this, e.g. on the chiral and the

field theory. Not surprisingly, on finer lattices outside the bulk phase the

necessarily depend on the chemical potential, however. The diquark condensate
is not affected by this problem and remains in good agreement with these
predictions. We also compare staggered with Wilson quarks to demonstrate that

conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, disorganised attachment,
personality disorders, dissociative identity disorder and psychosis. This work
presents a new psychotherapy for psychological traumas, based on a functional
model of the mind, built with elements borrowed from the fields of computer
science, artificial intelligence and neural networks. The model revolves around
the concept of hierarchical value and explains the emergence of dissociation
and splitting in response to emotional pain. The key intuition is that traumas
are caused by too strong negative emotions, which are in turn made possible by
a low-value self, which is in turn determined by low-value self-associated
ideas. The therapeutic method compiles a list of patient's traumas, identifies
for each trauma a list of low-value self-associated ideas, and provides for
each idea a list of counterexamples, to raise the self value and solve the
trauma. Since the psychotherapy proposed has not been clinically tested,
statements on its effectiveness are premature. However, since the conceptual
basis is solid and traumas are hypothesised to be present in many psychological
disorders, the potential gain may be substantial.

telecommunication, are subject of unprecedented technological transformations
by the Internet of Things. Usually, supply-demand systems involve actors that
produce and consume resources, e.g. energy, and they are regulated such that
supply meets demand, or demand meets available supply. Mismatches of supply and
demand may increase operational costs, can cause catastrophic damage in
infrastructure, for instance power blackouts, and may even lead to social
unrest and security threats. Long-term, operationally offline and top-down
regulatory decision-making by governmental officers, policy makers or system
operators may turn out to be ineffective for matching supply-demand under new
dynamics and opportunities that Internet of Things technologies bring to
supply-demand systems, for instance, interactive cyber-physical systems and
software agents running locally in physical assets to monitor and apply
automated control actions in real-time. e.g. power flow redistributions by
smart transformers to improve the Smart Grid reliability. Existing work on
online regulatory mechanisms of matching supply-demand either focuses on
game-theoretic solutions with assumptions that cannot be easily met in
real-world systems or assume centralized management entities and local access
to global information. This paper contributes a generic decentralized
self-regulatory framework, which, in contrast to related work, is shaped around
standardized control system concepts and Internet of Things technologies for an
easier adoption and applicability. The framework involves a decentralized
combinatorial optimization mechanism that matches supply-demand under different
regulatory scenarios.

fermionic gases have soon faded away because on approaching the resonance, the
system becomes unstable due to inelastic-collision processes. Here, we consider
an alternative scenario in which a single-component degenerate gas of fermions
in 2D is paired via phonon-mediated interactions provided by a 3D BEC
background. Within the weak-coupling regime, we calculate the critical
temperature $T_c$ for the fermionic pair formation, using Bethe-Salpeter
formalism, and show that it is significantly boosted by higher-order
diagramatic terms, such as phonon dressing and vertex corrections. We describe
in detail an experimental scheme to implement our proposal, and show that the
long-sought p-wave superfluid is at reach with state-of-the-art experiments.

continuously measuring energetic particles in the magnetosphere since 1978.
However, degradation of the proton detectors over time leads to an increase in
the energy thresholds of the instrument and imposes great challenges to studies
of long-term variability in the near-Earth space environment as well as a
general quantification of the proton fluxes. By comparing monthly mean
accumulated integral flux from a new and an old satellite at the same magnetic
local time (MLT) and time period, we estimate the change in energy thresholds.
The first 12 monthly energy spectra of the new satellite are used as a
reference, and the derived monthly correction factors over a year for an old
satellite show a small spread, indicating a robust calibration procedure. The
method enables us to determine for the first time the correction factors also
for the highest-energy channels of the proton detector. In addition, we make
use of the newest satellite in orbit (MetOp-01) to find correction factors for
2013 for the NOAA 17 and MetOp-02 satellites. Without taking into account the
level of degradation, the proton data from one satellite cannot be used
quantitatively for more than 2 to 3 years after launch. As the electron
detectors are vulnerable to contamination from energetic protons, the corrected
proton measurements will be of value for electron flux measurements too. Thus,
the correction factors ensure the correctness of both the proton and electron
measurements.

surveys available with crucial distance and gas-kinematic information. Our aim

similar angular resolutions. The SEDIGISM survey covers 78 deg^2 of the inner
Galaxy (-60 deg < l < +18 deg, |b| < 0.5 deg) in the J=2-1 rotational
transition of 13CO. This isotopologue of CO is less abundant than 12CO by
factors up to 100. Therefore, its emission has low to moderate optical depths,
and higher critical density, making it an ideal tracer of the cold, dense
interstellar medium. The data have been observed with the SHFI single-pixel
instrument at APEX. The observational setup covers the 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1)
lines, plus several transitions from other molecules. The observations have
been completed. Data reduction is in progress, and the final data products will
be made available in the near future. Here we give a detailed description of
the survey and the dedicated data reduction pipeline. Preliminary results based
on a science demonstration field covering -20 deg < l < -18.5 deg are
presented. Analysis of the 13CO(2-1) data in this field reveals compact clumps,
diffuse clouds, and filamentary structures at a range of heliocentric
distances. By combining our data with data in the (1-0) transition of CO
isotopologues from the ThrUMMS survey, we are able to compute a 3D realization
of the excitation temperature and optical depth in the interstellar medium.
Ultimately, this survey will provide a detailed, global view of the inner

most commonly defined as (1) the dayside magnetopause Chapman-Ferraro currents,
(2) the Birkeland field-aligned currents with high latitude ""region 1"" and
lower-latitude ""region 2"" currents connected to the partial ring current, (3)
the magnetotail currents, and (4) the symmetric ring current. In the near-Earth
nightside region, however, several of these current systems flow in close
proximity to each other. Moreover, the existence of other temporal current
systems, such as the substorm current wedge or ""banana"" current, has been
reported. It is very difficult to identify a local measurement as belonging to
a specific system. Such identification is important, however, because how the
current closes and how these loops change in space and time governs the
magnetic topology of the magnetosphere and therefore controls the physical
processes of geospace. Furthermore, many methods exist for identifying the
regions of near-Earth space carrying each type of current. This study presents
a robust collection of these definitions of current systems in geospace,
particularly in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere, as viewed from a
variety of observational and computational analysis techniques. The influence
of definitional choice on the resulting interpretation of physical processes
governing geospace dynamics is presented and discussed.

variety of fields, Geometric Algebra has yet to be applied to acoustics. Our
aim is to apply these concepts first to a simple problem in aeroacoustics,
sound propagation in uniform flow, and the more general problem of acoustic
propagation in non-uniform flows. By using Geometric Algebra we are able to
provide a simple geometric interpretation to a transformation commonly used to
solve for sound fields in uniform flow. We are then able to extend this concept
to an acoustic space-time applicable to irrotational, barotropic background
flows. This geometrical framework is used to naturally derive the requirements
that must be satisfied by the background flow in order for us to be able to
solve for sound propagation in the non-uniform flow using the simple wave
equation. We show that this is not possible in the most general situation, and
provide an explicit expression that must be satisfied for the transformation to
exist. We show that this requirement is automatically satisfied if the
background flow is incompressible or uniform, and for both these cases derive
an explicit transformation. In addition to a new physical interpretation for
the transformation, we show that unlike previous investigations, our work is
applicable to any frequency.

Distinguishing between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated morphologies, we find
that disks and spheroids have distinct color-mass distributions, in agreement
with studies at z~0. The smooth distribution across colors for the disk
galaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event.
Meanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming
disk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is
suggestive of rapid quenching. The distribution of moderate luminosity X-ray
AGN hosts is even across colors, in contrast, and we find similar numbers and
distributions among the two morphology types with no apparent dependence on
Eddington ratio. The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN
in the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the
AGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves
into the green valley. This suggests AGN feedback may play a role in the
quenching of star formation in the minority of galaxies that undergo major

two-dimensional, periodic, square lattice. The problem exhibits edge weights
which are taken from a distribution that allows for both positive and negative
values. Additionally, in this model variant all edges are directed. For a given
realization of the disorder, a minimally weighted loop/path configuration is
determined by performing a non-trivial transformation of the original lattice
into a minimum weight perfect matching problem. For this problem, fast
polynomial-time algorithms are available, thus we could study large systems
with high accuracy. Depending on the fraction of negatively and positively
weighted edges in the lattice, a continuous phase transition can be identified,
whose characterizing critical exponents we have estimated by a finite-size
scaling analyses of the numerically obtained data. We observe a strong change
of the universality class with respect to standard directed percolation, as
well as with respect to undirected negative-weight percolation. Furthermore,
the relation to directed polymers in random media is illustrated.

often involves the application of the classical Eq. 17 from the paper of Li &
Ma (1983) to discrete on- and off-source regions. The on- source region is
typically a circular area with radius {\theta} in which the signal is expected
to appear with the shape of the instrument point spread function (PSF). This
paper addresses the question of what is the {\theta} that maximises the
probability of detection for a given PSF width and background event density. In
the high count number limit and assuming a Gaussian PSF profile, the optimum is
found to be at $\zeta_\infty^2 \approx 2.51$ times the squared PSF width
$\sigma_\mathrm{PSF39}^2$. While this number is shown to be a good choice in
many cases, a dynamic formula for cases of lower count numbers, which favour
larger on-source regions, is given. The recipe to get to this parametrisation
can also be applied to cases with a non-Gaussian PSF. This result can
standardise and simplify analysis procedures, reduce trials and eliminate the
need for experience-based ad hoc cut definitions or expensive case-by-case
Monte Carlo simulations.

a general class of process theories that include the theory of classical
probabilistic processes as well as quantum theory. Unlike prior constructions
within categorical quantum mechanics, the objects of this theory encode
fine-grained causal relationships between subsystems and give a new method for
expressing and deriving consequences for a broad class of causal structures. We
show that this framework enables one to define families of processes which are
consistent with arbitrary acyclic causal orderings. In particular, one can
define one-way signalling (a.k.a. semi-causal) processes, non-signalling
processes, and quantum $n$-combs. Furthermore, our framework is general enough
to accommodate recently-proposed generalisations of classical and quantum
theory where processes only need to have a fixed causal ordering locally, but
globally allow indefinite causal ordering.
  To illustrate this point, we show that certain processes of this kind, such
as the quantum switch, the process matrices of Oreshkov, Costa, and Brukner,
and a classical three-party example due to Baumeler, Feix, and Wolf are all
instances of a certain family of processes we refer to as $\textrm{SOC}_n$ in
the appropriate category of higher-order causal processes. After defining these
families of causal structures within our framework, we give derivations of
their operational behaviour using simple, diagrammatic axioms.

transport evidence substantiating the anomaly to be a direct manifestation of a
Lifshitz transition in the Dirac band with an ultrahigh carrier mobility
exceeding 3$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the
Lifshitz transition is readily controllable by means of carrier doping, which
sets the anomaly peak temperature $T_p$. $T_p$ is found to scale approximately
as $n_H^{0.27}$, where the Hall carrier concentration $n_H$ is linked with the
Fermi level by $\epsilon_F$ $\propto$ $n_H^{1/3}$ in a linearly dispersed Dirac
band. This relation indicates $T_p$ monotonically increases with $\epsilon_F$,
which serves as an effective knob for fine tuning transport properties in

TNE-related potential problems, such as the importance of submission deadlines,
and provide students early hints and help to avoid the TNE-related problems.
The second part will provide assistance with general issues related to studying

  United States",,,"10.1016/j.physa.2017.02.079",,"q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GDP of China is about 11 trillion dollars and GDP of the United States is
about 18 trillion dollars. Suppose that we know for the coming years, economy
of the US will experience a real growth rate equal to \%3 and economy of China
will experience a real growth as of \%6. Now, the question is how long does it
take for economy of China to catch the economy of the United States. The early
impression is that the desired time is the answer of the equation
$11\times1.06^X=18\times1.03^X$. The correct answer however is quite different.
GDP is not a simple number and the gap between two countries can not be
addressed simply through their sizes. It is rather a geometrical object.
Countries pass different paths in the space of production. The gaps between GDP
of different countries depend on the path that each country passes through and
local metric. To address distance between economies of China and of the US we
need to know their utility preferences and the path that China passes to reach
the US size. The true gap then can be found if we calculate local metric along
this path. It resembles impressions about measurements in the General Theory of
Relativity. Path dependency of aggregate indexes is widely discussed in the
Index Number Theory. Our aim is to stick to the geometrical view presented in
the General Relativity to provide a visual understanding of the matter. We show
that different elements in the general relativity have their own counterparts
in economics. We claim that national agencies who provide aggregate data
resemble falling observers into a curved space time. It is while the World Bank
or international organizations are outside observers. The vision provided here,
leaves readers with a clear conclusion. If China keeps its growth rate, then
the economy of China should catch the economy of the United States sooner than
what we expect.

  of ideals",,,,,"math.LO math.AC math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unbounded entailment relations, introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1951), are a
slight variant of a notion which plays a fundamental r\^ole in logic (see Scott
1974) and in algebra (see Lombardi and Quitt\'e 2015). We call systems of
ideals their single-conclusion counterpart. If they preserve the order of a
commutative ordered monoid G and are equivariant w.r.t. its law, we call them
equivariant systems of ideals for G: they describe all morphisms from G to
meet-semilattice-ordered monoids generated by (the image of) G. Taking an
article by Lorenzen (1953) as a starting point, we also describe all morphisms
from a commutative ordered group G to lattice-ordered groups generated by G
through unbounded entailment relations that preserve its order, are
equivariant, and satisfy a regularity property invented by Lorenzen (1950); we
call them regular entailment relations. In particular, the free lattice-ordered
group generated by G is described through the finest regular entailment
relation for G, and we provide an explicit description for it; it is
order-reflecting if and only if the morphism is injective, so that the
Lorenzen-Clifford-Dieudonn\'e theorem fits into our framework. Lorenzen's
research in algebra starts as an inquiry into the system of Dedekind ideals for
the divisibility group of an integral domain R, and specifically into Wolfgang
Krull's ""Fundamentalsatz"" that R may be represented as an intersection of
valuation rings if and only if R is integrally closed: his constructive
substitute for this representation is the regularisation of the system of
Dedekind ideals, i.e. the lattice-ordered group generated by it when one
proceeds as if its elements are comparable.

additional optical and infrared data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and WISE

objects carried out mainly with the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT-150)

Academy of Sciences (BTA) are presented. Some observations have also been
performed with the Sayan Observatory 1.6-m AZT-33IK telescope. Currently we
selected eight CVs, four of which were found for the first time in our work.
Based on this sample, we have obtained preliminary constraints on the CV X-ray
luminosity function in the solar neighborhood in the low luminosity range, L_X
~ 10^29-10^30 erg s^-1 (0.5-2 keV). We show that the logarithmic slope of the
CV X-ray luminosity function in this luminosity range is less steep than at L_X
> 10^31 erg s^-1. From our CV X-ray luminosity function estimates it follows
that few thousand CVs will be detected in theSpectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)
observatory all-sky X-ray survey at high Galactic latitudes, which will allow
to obtain much more accurate measurements of CV X-ray luminosity function in
the luminosity range L_X < 10^30-10^31 erg s^-1.

  Systems","Preprint. Paper accepted to ICEER 2016",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internationalization of the higher education has created the so-called
borderless university, which provides better opportunities for learning and
increases the human and social sustainability. eLearning systems are a special
kind of software systems, developed to provide a platform for accessible
teaching and learning, including also online access to learning materials and
online support for learning and teaching. The aim of our current work is to
extract, analyse, and combine the results from multiple studies in order to
develop an RE framework for sustainable eLearning systems.
  We call a system sustainable, if it has a positive effect on and whose direct
and indirect negative impacts resulting from its development, deployment, and
usage are minimal. Sustainability has various dimensions. We classify
sustainability requirements of eLearning system to five dimensions: individual
(human), social, technical, environmental, and economic. In this paper, we
focus on human and social aspects (i.e., individual needs the relationship of
people within society), as the eLearning systems have a very strong impact on
human dimension of sustainability, where their impact on environmental
dimension is rather small. This also provides us a basis to identify the
corresponding requirements for sustainable eLearning systems. These
requirements include collaboration, learner-centred features, leadership
development and the reuse of the learning materials. As a result, achieving
individual and social requirements for eLearning systems would provide higher
quality of leaning and teaching, as well as better opportunities for learning
and increasing the human and social sustainability.

four classical color fields can be associated with the gravitational field. The
meaning of color here is that these fields do not add up to yield the Newtonian
gravitational field, but the forces and potential energies associated with them
add up to yield the Newtonian force and potential energy, respectively. These
four color fields can have associated magnetic fields as in linearized gravity.
Thus we envisage a theory where four sets of Maxwellian equations would
prevail. A quantum gravity theory with four spin 1 fields can thus be
envisaged.

reconstruction scheme for flat FRW geometry. The beauty of this scheme lies in
the assumption that the Hubble parameter can be expressed in terms of scalar
field and vice versa. Firstly, we develop field equations in this gravity and
present some general explicit forms of scalar field potential via this
technique. In the first case, we take De Sitter universe model and construct
some field potentials by taking different cases for coupling function. In the
second case, we derive some field potentials using power law model in the
presence of different matter sources like barotropic fluid, cosmological
constant and Chaplygin gas for some coupling functions. From graphical
analysis, it is concluded that using some specific values of the involved
parameters, the reconstructed scalar field potentials are cosmologically viable
in both cases.

other by applying gravitational forces, which depending on the masses assigned
to the solutions, to each other. The heaviest mass will move slower than other
masses and gravitate others. Due to nature of gravitation, GSA may pass global
minimum if some solutions stuck to local minimum. ABC updates the positions of
the best solutions that has obtained from GSA, preventing the GSA from sticking
to the local minimum by its strong searching ability. The proposed algorithm
improves the performance of GSA. The proposed method tested on 23 well-known
unimodal, multimodal and fixed-point multimodal benchmark test functions.
