performed in the curvilinear coordinate system, in which the center of the
computational domain coincides with the motionless star. However, the center of
mass may be shifted from the star due to the presence of any non-axisymmetric
mass distribution. As a result, the system exerts a gravity force on the star,
causing the star to move in response, which can affect the evolution of the
circumstellar disk. We aim at studying the effects of stellar motion on the
evolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In protostellar disks, a
non-axisymmetric distribution of matter in the form of spiral arms or massive
clumps can form due to gravitational instability. Protoplanetary disks can also
feature non-axisymmetric structures caused by a high-mass planet or a
large-scale vortex. We use 2D grid-based hydrodynamic simulations to explore
the effect of stellar motion. We adopt a non-inertial polar coordinate system
centered on the star, in which the stellar motion is taken into account by
calculating the indirect potential caused by the non-axisymmetric disk, a
high-mass planet, or a large-scale vortex. We found that the stellar motion has
a moderate effect on the evolution history in protostellar disks, reducing
somewhat the disk size and mass, while having a profound effect on the
collapsing envelope, changing its inner shape from an initially axisymmetric to
a non-axisymmetric configuration. Protoplanetary disk simulations show that the
stellar motion slightly reduces the width of the gap opened by a high-mass
planet, decreases the planet migration rate, and strengthens the large-scale
vortices formed at the viscosity transition. We conclude that the inclusion of
the indirect potential is recommended in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations
of circumstellar disks which use the curvilinear coordinate system.

  (i) We generalise the random Ramsey theorem of R\""odl and Ruci\'nski by
providing a resilience analogue. Our result unifies and generalises several
fundamental results in the area including the random version of Tur\'an's
theorem due to Conlon and Gowers and Schacht.
  (ii) The above result also resolves a general subcase of the asymmetric
random Ramsey conjecture of Kohayakawa and Kreuter.
  (iii) All of the above results in fact hold for uniform hypergraphs.

monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$).

proving a resilience version of the result.
  (vi) For partition regular matrices $A$ we determine, up to an error term in

the genetic fitting algorithm {{\sc pikaia}} to determine the following stellar
properties: effective temperature, surface gravity, mass-loss rate, helium
abundance, and projected rotational velocity. We present empirical effective
temperature versus spectral subtype calibrations at LMC-metallicity for giants

to the line of sight. Their compact radio structure can be imaged with very
long baseline interferometry (VLBI) on parsec scales. Blazars at extremely high
redshifts provide a unique insight into the AGN phenomena in the early
Universe. We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European
VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified
as blazar candidates based on X-ray observations. One of them, J2134$-$0419 is
firmly confirmed as a blazar with our VLBI observations, due to its
relativistically beamed radio emission. Its radio jet extended to $\sim$10
milli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI
observations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112
shows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux
density variability and its radio ""core"" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN
data suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar
candidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected
from radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec
scales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.
Their structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination
to the line of sight. This is in contrast with the blazar-type modeling of
their multi-band spectral energy distributions. Our work underlines the
importance of high-resolution VLBI imaging in confirming the blazar nature of
high-redshift radio sources.

this paper we consider two mathematical programming problems that model the

of power consumption while respecting the deadlines stated in the SLAs and

a distributed algorithm for runtime capacity allocation, based on Game Theory

(MR-CC) formalisms concerns the definition of the amplitudes of the single and
double excitation operators appearing in the exponential wave operator. If the
reference space is a complete active space (CAS) the number of these amplitudes
is larger than the number of singly and doubly excited determinants on which
one may project the eigenequation, and one must impose additional conditions.
The present work first defines a state-specific reference-independent operator
$\hat{\tilde{T}}^m$ which acting on the CAS component of the wave function
$|\Psi_0^m \rangle$ maximizes the overlap between
$(1+\hat{\tilde{T}}^m)|\Psi_0^m \rangle$ and the eigenvector of the CAS-SD CI
matrix $|\Psi_{\rm CAS-SD}^m \rangle$. This operator may be used to generate
approximate coefficients of the Triples and Quadruples, and a dressing of the
CAS-SD CI matrix, according to the intermediate Hamiltonian formalism. The
process may be iterated to convergence. As a refinement towards a strict
Coupled Cluster formalism, one may exploit reference-independent amplitudes
provided by $(1+\hat{\tilde{T}}^m)|\Psi_0^m \rangle$ to define a
reference-dependent operator $\hat{T}^m$ by fitting the eigenvector of the
(dressed) CAS-SD CI matrix. The two variants, which are internally
uncontracted, give rather similar results. The new MR-CC version has been
tested on the ground state potential energy curves of 6 molecules (up to
triple-bond breaking) and a two excited states. The non-parallelism error with

cycles, known as hypercycles, provide an elegant framework for understanding
the evolution of mutualism. Furthermore, hypercycles are highly susceptible to
parasites, spatial structure constituting a key protection against them.
However, there is an insufficient experimental validation of these theoretical
predictions, in addition to little knowledge on how environmental conditions
could shape the spatial dynamics of hypercycles. Here, we constructed spatially
extended hypercycles by using synthetic biology as a way to design mutualistic
and parasitic {\em E. coli} strains. A mathematical model of the hypercycle
front expansion is developed, providing analytic estimates of front speed
propagation. Moreover, we explore how the environment affects the mutualistic
consortium during range expansions. Interestingly, moderate improvements in
environmental conditions (namely, increasing the availability of
growth-limiting amino acids) can lead to a slowing-down of the front speed. Our
agent-based simulations suggest that opportunistic depletion of environmental
amino acids can lead to subsequent high fractions of stagnant cells at the
front, and thus to the slow-down of the front speed. Moreover, environmental
deterioration can also shape the interaction of the parasitic strain towards
the hypercycle. On the one hand, the parasite is excluded from the population
during range expansions in which the two species mutualism can thrive (in
agreement with a classical theoretical prediction). On the other hand,
environmental deterioration (e.g., associated with toxic chemicals) can lead to
the survival of the parasitic strain, while reshaping the interactions within
the three-species. The evolutionary and ecological implications for the design
of synthetic consortia are outlined.

emerges as a global property of local mesoscopic and microscopic interactions.
Complex network theory allows to elicit the functional architecture of the
brain in terms of links (correlations) between nodes (grey matter regions) and
to extract information out of the noise. Here we present the analysis of
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from forty healthy humans during the
resting condition for the investigation of the basal scaffold of the functional
brain network organization. We show how brain regions tend to coordinate by
forming a highly hierarchical chain-like structure of homogeneously clustered
anatomical areas. A maximum spanning tree approach revealed the centrality of
the occipital cortex and the peculiar aggregation of cerebellar regions to form
a closed core. We also report the hierarchy of network segregation and the
level of clusters integration as a function of the connectivity strength
between brain regions.

of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems

properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model,
named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel
neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on
learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other
one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared
layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The
shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact
with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all
baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.

bound the fraction of DM collapsed into miniclusters, $f_{\rm MC}$. For an

$f_{\rm MC}<0.22(m_a/100\,\mu\text{eV})^{-0.57}$, which represents the first
observational constraint on the minicluster fraction. We forecast that a
high-efficiency observation of ten nights with Subaru would be sufficient to
constrain $f_{\rm MC}\lesssim 0.1$ over the entire QCD axion mass range. We
make various approximations to derive these constraints and dedicated analyses

but also show an extension towards the south(east), coinciding with an H2 knot
from the jet at about 800-1000 au from the protostar. This is especially clear
in the case of H2-13CO and CH3OCH3. We fitted the spectra at representative
positions for the disc and the outflow, and found that the abundances of most
COMs are comparable at both positions, suggesting that COMs are enhanced in
shocks as a result of the passage of the outflow. By coupling a parametric
shock model to a large gas-grain chemical network including COMs, we find that

such as the ILC and CEPC, gives it greater sensitivity to the coefficients of
some of the operators we study. We find that CLIC Higgs measurements may be
sensitive to new physics scales $\Lambda = \mathcal{O}(10)$TeV for individual

marginalising over the coefficients of all contributing operators. We give some
examples of the corresponding prospective constraints on specific scenarios for

quasi-steady radio emission as a counterpart of both FRBs and pulsar-driven

However, in this case, the magnetically-powered scenario may be favored as an
FRB energy source because of the efficiency problem in the rotation-powered

one or the neutron star is born by the accretion-induced collapse with $M_{\rm

molecular cloud cores) HCN 1-0 is well correlated with the dense molecular gas
mass using a standard log-log relationship. However individual clouds in this
environment show systematic deviations from this relationship that contribute
to around 0.75 dex of scatter. Most notably, Sgr B2, the most massive cloud in
the Galactic center, has an integrated HCN 1-0 intensity of cloud less than
half its mass, and several other clouds including GCM-0.02-0.07 show an
enhancement of HCN 1-0 by a factor of 2-3 relative to clouds of comparable
mass. We also find that HCN 1-0 is more intense for a given mass in the
large-scale diffuse emission in the central 300 parsecs compared to the compact
emission from individual cloud cores. We identify the two primary sources of
scatter in the relationship between HCN 1-0 and dense gas mass to be
self-absorption (which reduces the observed HCN 1-0 intensity of Sgr B2) and
variations in HCN abundance, which appear to increase the brightness of HCN 1-0
in GCM-0.02-0.07 and other clouds. We find that these sources of scatter would
only contribute to an ~10% error in the dense gas mass inferred from the HCN
1-0 intensity in the Galactic center. However, the implied order of magnitude
HCN abundance variations between Galactic center clouds, and the systematic
nature of these variations warn of potential biases in the use of HCN as dense
gas mass tracer in more extreme environments, such as AGN and shock-dominated
regions. Finally, we also investigate other tracers having transitions near 3
mm, finding that HNCO, HNC and HCO+ largely behave like HCN, while HC3N, and
CH3CN are higher fidelity tracers of the amount of gas in clouds like Sgr B2

binary, without experiencing common envelope phases. We investigate necessary
conditions required for PopIII binaries to form BBHs coalescing within the
Hubble time with a semi-analytical model calibrated by the stellar evolution
simulations. The formation efficiency of coalescing PopIII BBHs is estimated
for two different initial conditions for PopIII binaries with large and small
separations, respectively. Consequently, in both models, $\sim 10\%$ of the
total PopIII binaries form BBHs only through stable mass transfer and $\sim
10\%$ of these BBHs merge due to gravitational wave emission within the Hubble
time. Furthermore, the chirp mass of merging BBHs has a flat distribution over
$15\lesssim M_{\rm chirp}/M_\odot \lesssim 35$. This formation pathway of
PopIII BBHs is presumably robust because stable mass transfer is less uncertain
than common envelope evolution, which is the main formation channel for
Population II BBHs. We also test the hypothesis that the BBH mergers detected
by LIGO originate from PopIII stars using our result and the total number of
PopIII stars formed in the early universe as inferred from the optical depth
measured by Planck. We conclude that the PopIII BBH formation scenario can
explain the mass-weighted merger rate of the LIGO's O1 events with the maximal

time-steady versus bursty in galaxies. Recent models explain the observed
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation between star formation rate and gas surface
densities in galaxies as resulting from a balance between stellar feedback and
gravity. We argue that bursty star formation occurs when such an equilibrium
cannot be stably sustained, and identify two regimes in which galaxy-scale star
formation should be bursty: i) at high redshift (z>~1) for galaxies of all
masses, and ii) at low masses (depending on gas fraction) for galaxies at any
redshift. At high redshift, characteristic galactic dynamical timescales become
too short for supernova feedback to effectively respond to gravitational
collapse in galactic discs (an effect recently identified for galactic nuclei),
whereas in dwarf galaxies star formation occurs in too few bright star-forming
regions to effectively average out. Burstiness is also enhanced at high
redshift owing to elevated gas fractions in the early Universe. Our model can
thus explain the bursty star formation rates predicted in these regimes by
recent high-resolution galaxy formation simulations, as well as the bursty star
formation histories observationally-inferred in both local dwarf and
high-redshift galaxies. In our model, bursty star formation is associated with
particularly strong spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae. Such clustering
can promote the formation of galactic winds and our model may thus also explain
the much higher wind mass loading factors inferred in high-redshift massive
galaxies relative to their z~0 counterparts.

parsecs, which can activate rapid accretion onto supermassive black holes
(SMBHs), giving rise to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). During a significant
fraction of this process, SMBHs are predicted to be enshrouded by gas and dust.
Studying 52 galactic nuclei in infrared-selected local Luminous and
Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in different merger stages in the hard X-ray
band, where radiation is less affected by absorption, we find that the amount
of material around SMBHs increases during the last phases of the merger. We
find that the fraction of Compton-thick (CT, $N_{\rm\,H}\geq
10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$) AGN in late merger galaxies is higher
($f_{\rm\,CT}=65^{+12}_{-13}\%$) than in local hard X-ray selected AGN
($f_{\rm\,CT}=27\pm 4\%$), and that obscuration reaches its maximum when the
nuclei of the two merging galaxies are at a projected distance of
$D_{12}\simeq0.4-10.8$ kiloparsecs ($f_{\rm\,CT}=77_{-17}^{+13}\%$). We also
find that all AGN of our sample in late merger galaxies have $N_{\rm\,H}>
10^{23}\rm\,cm^{-2}$, which implies that the obscuring material covers
$95^{+4}_{-8}\%$ of the X-ray source. These observations show that the material
is most effectively funnelled from the galactic scale to the inner tens of
parsecs during the late stages of galaxy mergers, and that the close
environment of SMBHs in advanced mergers is richer in gas and dust with respect
to that of SMBHs in isolated galaxies, and cannot be explained by the classical
AGN unification model in which the torus is responsible for the obscuration.

of H2 in three pointings in the central 3 parsecs of the Galaxy: toward the
Southwest region and Northeast region of the Galactic center Circumnuclear
Disk, and toward the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. We detect pure rotational
lines from 0-0 S(0) to S(13), as well as a number of rovibrationally excited
transitions. From the pure rotational lines, we are able to describe the
molecular gas with three discrete temperature components: a `hot' component
between 500-600 K, a `hotter' component at 1250-1350 K, and a `hottest'
component at > 2600 K. Toward Sgr A*, likely due to a combination of poorer
baselines and weaker emission, we only detect a single hot component, at 1100
K. The observed excitation is consistent with heating via C-shocks. We also fit
a continuous temperature distribution to the the S(1) through S(7) lines by
assuming a power-law distribution of temperatures. We measure power law indices
of n = 3.22 for the Northeast region and n = 2.83 for the Southwest region,
with a smaller index indicating a higher fraction of warm gas. These indices
are lower than those measured for other galaxies or other Galactic center
clouds, which are measured to have n= 4-6. If we extrapolate this temperature
distribution down to a cutoff temperature of 50 K, then the total molecular gas
mass that we would measure for the Southwest (Northeast) region is 32 (140) %
of the total molecular gas mass inferred from the dust emission, and 26 (125) %
of the total molecular gas mass inferred from the CO emission for these
regions. Ultimately, we find that the disagreement in the amount of mass
recovered for these two regions means that this method cannot yet be verified

  We find that two populations provide an excellent recovery of $\rho(r)$

to measure $\rho(r)$ over the range $0.5 < r/R_{1/2} < 2$ and broadly constrain
$\beta(r)$. Including proper motion data for all stars gives an even better
performance, with $\rho$ and $\beta$ well-measured over the range $0.25 <

find that the GC system velocity dispersion scales with host galaxy stellar
mass in a similar manner to the Faber-Jackson relation for the stellar velocity

is the radial component of the magnetic field $B_{\rm r}$, the most readily

to the radial component where the viewing angle is exactly zero, some
approximation is required to estimate $B_{\rm r}$ at all other observed

compared to a method which invokes computing a potential field that matches the

$B_{\rm r}^{\rm pot}$ is recovered. We demonstrate that in regions that are
truly dominated by radially-oriented field at the resolution of the data

entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary

an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement,
implying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states

volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the
completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no
universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type

capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model

empirically a near-constant fraction of the total mass M_h = M_bary + M_dark of
the galaxy, across a range of 10^5 in galaxy mass. This trend is radically
unlike the strongly nonlinear behavior of total stellar mass M_star versus M_h.
We discuss extensions of this trend to two more extreme situations: (a) entire
clusters of galaxies, and (b) the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) recently
discovered in Coma and elsewhere. Our calibration of the ratio \eta_M = M_GCS /
M_h from normal galaxies, accounting for new revisions in the adopted
mass-to-light ratio for GCs, now gives \eta_M = 2.9 \times 10^{-5} as the mean
absolute mass fraction. We find that the same ratio appears valid for galaxy
clusters and UDGs. Estimates of \eta_M in the four clusters we examine tend to
be slightly higher than for individual galaxies, butmore data and better
constraints on the mean GC mass in such systems are needed to determine if this
difference is significant. We use the constancy of \eta_M to estimate total
masses for several individual cases; for example, the total mass of the Milky
Way is calculated to be M_h = 1.1 \times 10^{12} M_sun. Physical explanations
for the uniformity of \eta_M are still descriptive, but point to a picture in
which massive, dense star clusters in their formation stages were relatively
immune to the feedback that more strongly influenced lower-density regions
where most stars form.

explicitly given quasi-stationary states of the system, evolve on the time
scale $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})$ and have been shown to play a key role in its
long-time evolution. Of particular interest is the role that $\delta$ plays in
selecting which of these two states is observed. Recent numerical studies
suggest that, after a transient period of rapid decay of the high Fourier
modes, the bar state will be selected if $\delta \neq 1$, while the dipole will
be selected if $\delta = 1$. Our results support this claim and seek to
mathematically formalize it. We consider the system in Fourier space, project
it onto a center manifold consisting of the lowest eight Fourier modes, and use
this as a model to study the selection of bars and dipoles. It is shown for
this ODE model that the value of $\delta$ controls the behavior of the
asymptotic ratio of the low modes, thus determining the likelihood of observing
a bar state or dipole after an initial transient period. Moreover, in our
model, for all $\delta \approx 1$, there is an initial time period in which the
high modes decay at the rapid rate $\mathcal{O}(e^{-t/\nu})$, while the low
modes evolve at the slower $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})$ rate. The results for the
ODE model are proven using energy estimates and invariant manifolds and further
supported by formal asymptotic expansions and numerics.

functions based on the modified Bloch equations, we obtained concentration
dependences of EPR parameters of radicals at each measured temperature. From
concentration dependences of the EPR parameters quantifying spin dephasing,
coherence transfer, and hyperfine splitting, we determined linear concentration
coefficients, whose values depend on the relative motion of radicals due to
modulation of the Heisenberg spin exchange (HSE) and dipole-dipole (DD)
interactions between them. We applied the continuous diffusion model for
relative motion of radicals and we evaluated the diffusion coefficients of
radicals from the concentration coefficients using the standard relations and
the relations derived from kinetic equations for the spin evolution of
interacting radical pair. It was found that the latter equations lead to the
better agreement between the diffusion coefficients calculated from different
concentration coefficients. The calculated diffusion coefficients of 14N- and
15N-labeled radicals show similar values, which is an expected result that
supports the presented method. Upon lowering the temperature into the
supercooled state, the calculated diffusion coefficients decrease slower than
is predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relation and slower than the rotational
diffusion coefficient. Similar effects were detected in NMR studies of the
rotational and translational motion of water molecules in supercooled water.

associated with an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra
$\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}$ equipped with an action of the dihedral group
$D_{2T}$, $T \geq 1$ through (anti-)linear automorphisms. We show that a very
broad family of classical integrable field theories can be recast as examples
of such classical dihedral affine Gaudin models. Among these are the principal
chiral model on an arbitrary real Lie group $G_0$ and the $\mathbb{Z}_T$-graded
coset $\sigma$-model on any coset of $G_0$ defined in terms of an order $T$
automorphism of its complexification. Most of the multi-parameter integrable
deformations of these $\sigma$-models recently constructed in the literature
provide further examples. The common feature shared by all these integrable
field theories, which makes it possible to reformulate them as classical
dihedral affine Gaudin models, is the fact that they are non-ultralocal. In
particular, we also obtain affine Toda field theory in its lesser-known
non-ultralocal formulation as another example of this construction.
  We propose that the interpretation of a given classical non-ultralocal
integrable field theory as a classical dihedral affine Gaudin model provides a
natural setting within which to address its quantisation. At the same time, it
may also furnish a general framework for understanding the massive ODE/IM
correspondence since the known examples of integrable field theories for which
such a correspondence has been formulated can all be viewed as dihedral affine
Gaudin models.

inter-species interactions selforganize biosystems. Human interactions unify
these and many others. Physical reality is only interactions identified or not
yet. Each interaction is elementary yes-no action of impulse which models a
natural Bit. Natural interactive process, transferring Bits, models information
process.
  Information is universal physical substance a phenomenon of interaction which
not only originates information but transfers it sequentially. Mutually
interacting processes enable creating new elements like chemical chain
reactions. The elements enclosing components of reaction memorize the
interactive yes-no result similar to encoding. Energy quantity and quality of
specific interaction determine sequence of transferring information, its
encoding, and limit the code length. The introduced formalism of natural
emergence information and its encoding also shows advantage over non-natural
encoding. The impulse sequential natural encoding merges memory with the time
of memorizing information and compensates the cost by running time intervals of
encoding. Information process binds the encoding impulse reversible
microprocesses in multiple impulses macroprocess of information irreversible
dynamics establishing interactive integrated information dynamics. The encoding
process integrates geometrical triplet coding structure rotating double helix
of sequencing cells Bits, which commands cognition, intelligence including
conscience.
  The results validate computer simulation, and experiments.

transition temperature leads to the formation of shear bands as a result of
shear localization. It is believed that shear banding originates from
individual stress concentrators having quadrupolar symmetry. To elucidate the
underlying mechanisms of shear band formation, microstructural investigations
were carried out on sheared zones using transmission electron microscopy. Here
we show evidence of a characteristic signature present in shear bands
manifested in the form of sinusoidal density variations. We present an
analytical solution for the observed post-deformation state derived from
continuum mechanics using an alignment of quadrupolar stress field
perturbations for the plastic events. Since we observe qualitatively similar
features for three different types of metallic glasses that span the entire
range of characteristic properties of metallic glasses, we conclude that the
reported deformation behavior is generic for all metallic glasses, and thus has
far-reaching consequences for the deformation behavior of amorphous solids in
general.

LIV effects is used to predict major changes in the propagation of photons with
energy above $10^{18}$ eV. The flux of GZK photons on Earth considering LIV is
calculated for several source models of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR).
The predicted flux of GZK gamma-rays is compared to the new upper limits on the
photon flux obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory in order to impose upper
limits on the LIV coefficients of order $n =$ 0, 1 and 2. The limits on the LIV
coefficients derived here are more realistic than previous works and in some
cases more restrictive. The analysis resulted in LIV upper limits in the photon
sector of $\delta_{\gamma,0}^{limit} \sim -10^{-20}$,
$\delta_{\gamma,1}^{limit} \sim -10^{-38} \; \mathrm{eV^{-1}}$ and
$\delta_{\gamma,2}^{limit} \sim -10^{-56} \; \mathrm{eV^{-2}}$ in the

idiopathic scoliosis from 3D spine models reconstructed from biplanar X-ray
images. Recent progress in machine learning have allowed to improve
classification and prognosis rates, but lack a probabilistic framework to
measure uncertainty in the data. We propose a discriminative probabilistic
manifold embedding where locally linear mappings transform data points from
high-dimensional space to corresponding low-dimensional coordinates. A
discriminant adjacency matrix is constructed to maximize the separation between
progressive and non-progressive groups of patients diagnosed with scoliosis,
while minimizing the distance in latent variables belonging to the same class.
To predict the evolution of deformation, a baseline reconstruction is projected
onto the manifold, from which a spatiotemporal regression model is built from
parallel transport curves inferred from neighboring exemplars. Rate of
progression is modulated from the spine flexibility and curve magnitude of the
3D spine deformation. The method was tested on 745 reconstructions from 133
subjects using longitudinal 3D reconstructions of the spine, with results
demonstrating the discriminatory framework can identify between progressive and
non-progressive of scoliotic patients with a classification rate of 81% and
prediction differences of 2.1$^{o}$ in main curve angulation, outperforming
other manifold learning methods. Our method achieved a higher prediction
accuracy and improved the modeling of spatiotemporal morphological changes in
highly deformed spines compared to other learning methods.

form provides a representation that can be translated to other processes with
$K\pi$ interactions with their own coupling functions, while automatically

stability of solitary traveling waves in Hamiltonian nonlinear dynamical
lattices, of which the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam and the Toda lattice are prototypical
examples. One is as an eigenvalue problem for a stationary solution in a
co-traveling frame, while the other is as a periodic orbit modulo shifts. We
connect the eigenvalues of the former with the Floquet multipliers of the
latter and based on this formulation derive an energy-based spectral stability
criterion. It states that a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for a
change in the wave stability occurs when the functional dependence of the
energy (Hamiltonian) $H$ of the model on the wave velocity $c$ changes its
monotonicity. Moreover, near the critical velocity where the change of
stability occurs, we provide explicit leading-order computation of the unstable
eigenvalues, based on the second derivative of the Hamiltonian $H""(c_0)$
evaluated at the critical velocity $c_0$. We corroborate this conclusion with a
series of analytically and numerically tractable examples and discuss its
parallels with a recent energy-based criterion for the stability of discrete

well-known Dold-Kan construction in simplicial homotopy theory can be
fruitfully applied to convert link homology theories into homotopy theories.
Dold and Kan prove that there is a functor from the category of chain complexes
over a commutative ring with unit to the category of simplicial objects over
that ring such that chain homotopic maps go to homotopic maps in the simplicial
category. Furthermore, this is an equivalence of categories. In this way, given
a link homology theory, we construct a mapping taking link diagrams to a
category of simplicial objects such that up to looping or delooping, link
diagrams related by Reidemeister moves will give rise to homotopy equivalent
simplicial objects, and the homotopy groups of these objects will be equal to
the link homology groups of the original link homology theory. The construction
is independent of the particular link homology theory. A simplifying point in
producing a homotopy simplicial object in relation to a chain complex occurs
when the chain complex is itself derived (via face maps) from a simplicial
object that satisfies the Kan extension condition. Under these circumstances
one can use that simplicial object rather than apply the Dold-Kan functor to
the chain complex. We will give examples of this situation in regard to
Khovanov homology. We will investigate detailed working out of this
correspondence in separate papers. The purpose of this note is to announce the
basic relationships for using simplicial methods in this domain. Thus we do
more than just quote the Dold-Kan Theorem. We give a review of simplicial
theory and we point to specific constructions, particularly in relation to
Khovanov homology, that can be used to make simplicial homotopy types directly.

wherein the available data typically consists of: (i) a small or moderate sized
'labeled' data, and (ii) a much larger sized 'unlabeled' data. Such data arises
naturally from settings where the outcome, unlike the covariates, is expensive
to obtain, a frequent scenario in modern studies involving large databases like
electronic medical records (EMR). Supervised estimators like the ordinary least
squares (OLS) estimator utilize only the labeled data. It is often of interest
to investigate if and when the unlabeled data can be exploited to improve
estimation of the regression parameter in the adopted linear model.
  In this paper, we propose a class of 'Efficient and Adaptive Semi-Supervised
Estimators' (EASE) to improve estimation efficiency. The EASE are two-step
estimators adaptive to model mis-specification, leading to improved (optimal in
some cases) efficiency under model mis-specification, and equal (optimal)
efficiency under a linear model. This adaptive property, often unaddressed in
the existing literature, is crucial for advocating 'safe' use of the unlabeled
data. The construction of EASE primarily involves a flexible
'semi-non-parametric' imputation, including a smoothing step that works well
even when the number of covariates is not small; and a follow up 'refitting'
step along with a cross-validation (CV) strategy both of which have useful
practical as well as theoretical implications towards addressing two important
issues: under-smoothing and over-fitting. We establish asymptotic results
including consistency, asymptotic normality and the adaptive properties of
EASE. We also provide influence function expansions and a 'double' CV strategy
for inference. The results are further validated through extensive simulations,
followed by application to an EMR study on auto-immunity.

orbits around young stars by disk gravitational instability, but the roles of
disk instability and core accretion for forming gas giants on shorter period
orbits are less clear. The controversy extends to population synthesis models
of exoplanet demographics and to hydrodynamical models of the fragmentation
process. The latter refers largely to the handling of radiative transfer in
three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical models, which controls heating and
cooling processes in gravitationally unstable disks, and hence dense clump
formation. A suite of models using the $\beta$ cooling approximation is
presented here. The initial disks have masses of 0.091 $M_\odot$ and extend
from 4 to 20 AU around a 1 $M_\odot$ protostar. The initial minimum Toomre
$Q_i$ values range from 1.3 to 2.7, while $\beta$ ranges from 1 to 100. We show
that the choice of $Q_i$ is equal in importance to the $\beta$ value assumed:
high $Q_i$ disks can be stable for small $\beta$, when the initial disk
temperature is taken as a lower bound, while low $Q_i$ disks can fragment for
high $\beta$. These results imply that the evolution of disks toward low $Q_i$
must be taken into account in assessing disk fragmentation possibilities, at
least in the inner disk, i.e., inside about 20 AU. The models suggest that if
low $Q_i$ disks can form, there should be an as yet largely undetected
population of gas giants orbiting G dwarfs between about 6 AU and 16 AU.

Furthermore, proposed network models predict spatial regularities in the firing

free navigation, we first show that there are strong variations in the mean
firing rate of the fields of individual grid cells and thus show that the data
is inconsistent with the theoretical models that predict similar peak
magnitudes. We then build a two population excitatory-inhibitory network model
in which sparse spatially selective input to the excitatory cells, presumed to
arise from e.g. salient external stimuli, hippocampus or a combination of both,
leads to the variability in the firing field amplitudes of grid cells. We show
that, when combined with appropriate connectivity between the excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, the variability in the firing field amplitudes of grid
cells results in inhibitory neurons that do not exhibit regular spatial firing,
consistent with experimental data. Finally, we show that even if the spatial
positions of the fields are maintained, variations in the firing rates of the
fields of grid cells are enough to cause remapping of hippocampal cells.

massive, ranging from 0.5to 116 MSun with a mean mass of 8 MSun and a median
mass of 3.7 MSun. A stability analysis for the clumps suggest that the majority
are (thermally) Jeans stable, with M/M_J < 1. We further compare the locations
of known protostars with the observed submillimetre emission, finding that
younger protostars, i.e., Class 0 and I sources, are strongly correlated with
submillimetre peaks and that the clumps with protostars are among the most
Jeans unstable. Finally, we contrast the evolutionary conditions in the two

we show that, due to specific properties of their dispersion, lattice
excitations bind to impurities with both negative and positive potentials. We
demonstrate that the finite size of the composite excitation leads to formation
of multiple excitation-impurity bound states. The number and the degree of
localization of these bound states depend on the signs and relative magnitudes
of the impurity potential and the binding strength of two quasiparticles. We
also report the existence of excitation-impurity bound states whose energies
are located in the continuum band. Secondly, we study a change in the
entanglement between the centre of mass and relative coordinate degrees of

decoherence caused by it. For a composite quasiparticle on a lattice, the
entanglement between its relative and centre of mass coordinate degrees of
freedom arises naturally due to inseparability of the two-particle Hamiltonian.

environment. Secondary user transmits in a channel if the channel is sensed to
be vacant. This results in a tradeoff between sensing time and transmission
time. When secondary users are energy constrained, energy available for
transmission is less if more energy is used in sensing. This gives rise to an
energy tradeoff. For multiple primary channels, secondary users must decide
appropriate sensing time and transmission power in each channel to maximize
average aggregate-bit throughput in each frame duration while ensuring
quality-of-service of primary users. Considering time and energy as limited
resources, we formulate this problem as a resource allocation problem.
Initially a single secondary user scenario is considered and solution is
obtained using decomposition and alternating optimization techniques. Later we
extend the analysis for the case of multiple secondary users. Simulation
results are presented to study effect of channel occupancy, fading and energy

In particular, we present the two Poisson homogeneous structures on

Darboux-type transformations. The solutions of this type - known as P-breathers

relied on using the solutions of yet another nonlinear equation,

have shown that in fact one doesn't have to use KP-I but can instead reach the
same results just with NLS solutions, but only if they are dressed via the
binary Darboux transformation. In particular, our approach allows to construct
all the Dubard-Matveev P-breathers. Furthermore, the new method can lead to
some completely new, previously unknown solutions. One particular solution that
we have constructed describes two positon-like waves, colliding with each other

system can be totally governed by a two-mode Dicke-lattice model, which
includes all of the counter-rotating terms and therefore works well in the
ultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments. Attributed to its
special atom-photon coupling scheme, this model supports a global conserved
excitation and a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry, rather than the discrete $Z_{2}$
symmetry in the standard Dicke-lattice model. This distinct change of symmetry
via adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon
localization/delocalization behavior. Specifically, the atom-photon interaction
features stable Mott-lobe structures of photons and a second-order
superfluid-Mott-insulator phase transition, which share similarities with the
Jaynes-Cummings-lattice and Bose-Hubbard models. More interestingly, the
Mott-lobe structures predicted here depend crucially on the atom number of each
site. We also show that our model can be mapped into a continuous $XX$ spin
model. Finally, we propose a scheme to implement the introduced cavity array in
circuit quantum electrodynamics. This work broadens our understanding of

we accounted for the social ties between editors and authors by developing a
measure of repeat authorship among an editor's article set, and (ii) we
accounted for the rate of citations directed towards the editor's own
publications in the reference list of each article he/she oversaw. Our results

$\ell$ surviving nodes, dubbed local helper nodes, in the host cluster. We
first identify the optimal trade-off between storage-overhead and inter-cluster

better than what is achievable via space-sharing existing coding solutions,

intra-cluster repair BW to achieve optimal trade-off. Our bounds reveal the
interesting fact that, while it is beneficial to increase the number of local

the emphasis of model checking is on establishing the truth of a property in a
model, we rely on the proof theoretic notion of additive inference rules, since
such rules allow provability to directly describe truth conditions.
Unfortunately, the additive treatment of quantifiers requires inference rules
to have infinite sets of premises and the additive treatment of model
descriptions provides no natural notion of state exploration. By employing a
focused proof system, it is possible to construct large scale, synthetic rules
that also qualify as additive but contain elements of multiplicative inference.
These additive synthetic rules -- essentially rules built from the description
of a model -- allow a direct treatment of state exploration. This proof
theoretic framework provides a natural treatment of reachability and
non-reachability problems, as well as tabled deduction, bisimulation, and
winning strategies.

with the metallicity ($Z$). The dust abundance, which is related to the
metallicity, is responsible for this correlation through dust shielding of
dissociating photons and H$_2$ formation on dust surfaces. In this paper, we
investigate how the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity
($\mathcal{D}$--$Z$ relation) affects the H$_2$ and CO abundances (and
$X_\mathrm{CO}$) of a `molecular' cloud. For the $\mathcal{D}$--$Z$ relation,
we adopt a dust evolution model developed in our previous work, which treats
the evolution of not only dust abundance but also grain sizes in a galaxy.
Shielding of dissociating photons and H$_2$ formation on dust are solved
consistently with the dust abundance and grain sizes. As a consequence, our
models {predict consistent metallicity dependence of $X_\mathrm{CO}$ with
observational data}. Among various processes driving dust evolution, grain
growth by accretion has the largest impact on the $X_\mathrm{CO}$--$Z$
relation. The other processes also have some impacts on the
$X_\mathrm{CO}$--$Z$ relation, but their effects are minor compared with the
scatter of the observational data at the metallicity range ($Z\gtrsim 0.1$
Z$_\odot$) where CO could be detected. We also find that dust condensation in
stellar ejecta has a dramatic impact on the H$_2$ abundance at low
metallicities ($\lesssim 0.1$ Z$_\odot$), relevant for damped Lyman $\alpha$
systems and nearby dwarf galaxies, and that the grain size dependence of H$_2$

zero electric dipole scattering. By overlapping magnetic dipole resonance with
the anapole mode we achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering in the far-field

demonstrate that such condition can be realized for two subwavelength

changing from on to off, and vice versa, depending on temperature. Aggregation
of a large group of similar devices into a statistical ensemble is considered,
where the devices operate following the same dynamics subject to stochastic
perturbations and randomized, Poisson on/off switching policy. We analyze,
using theoretical and computational tools of statistical physics, how the
ensemble relaxes to a stationary distribution and establish relation between
the relaxation and statistics of the probability flux, associated with devices'
cycling in the mixed (discrete, switch on/off, and continuous, temperature)
phase space. This allowed us to derive and analyze spectrum of the
non-equilibrium (detailed balance broken) statistical system and uncover how
switching policy affects oscillatory trend and speed of the relaxation.
Relaxation of the ensemble is of a practical interest because it describes how
the ensemble recovers from significant perturbations, e.g. forceful temporary
switching off aimed at utilizing flexibility of the ensemble in providing

control of devices with cyclic energy consumption patterns, e.g.,
thermostatically controlled loads. Specifically we utilize and develop the
class of MDP models previously coined linearly solvable MDPs, that describe
optimal dynamics of the probability distribution of an ensemble of many cycling
devices. Two principally different settings are discussed. First, we consider
optimal strategy of the ensemble aggregator balancing between minimization of
the cost of operations and minimization of the ensemble welfare penalty, where
the latter is represented as a KL-divergence between actual and normal
probability distributions of the ensemble. Then, second, we shift to the demand
response setting modeling the aggregator's task to minimize the welfare penalty
under the condition that the aggregated consumption matches the targeted
time-varying consumption requested by the system operator. We discuss a
modification of both settings aimed at encouraging or constraining the
transitions between different states. The dynamic programming feature of the
resulting modified MDPs is always preserved; however, `linear solvability' is
lost fully or partially, depending on the type of modification. We also
conducted some (limited in scope) numerical experimentation using the
formulations of the first setting. We conclude by discussing future
generalizations and applications.

settings. This approach, whose origins can be traced to machine learning, is
based on the leave-one-out bootstrap for prediction error. In machine learning
this is called the out-of-bag (OOB) error. To obtain the OOB error for a model,
one draws a bootstrap sample and fits the model to the in-sample data. The
out-of-sample prediction error for the model is obtained by calculating the
prediction error for the model using the out-of-sample data. Repeating and
averaging yields the OOB error, which represents a robust cross-validated
estimate of the accuracy of the underlying model. By a simple modification to
the bootstrap data involving ""noising up"" a variable, the OOB method yields a
variable importance (VIMP) index, which directly measures how much a specific
variable contributes to the prediction precision of a model. VIMP provides a
scientifically interpretable measure of the effect size of a variable, we call
the ""predictive effect size"", that holds whether the researcher's model is
correct or not, unlike the p-value whose calculation is based on the assumed
correctness of the model. We also discuss a marginal VIMP index, also easily
calculated, which measures the marginal effect of a variable, or what we call
""the discovery effect"". The OOB procedure can be applied to both parametric and
nonparametric regression models and requires only that the researcher can
repeatedly fit their model to bootstrap and modified bootstrap data. We
illustrate this approach on a survival data set involving patients with
systolic heart failure and to a simulated survival data set where the model is
incorrectly specified to illustrate its robustness to model misspecification.

asymmetric strange-antistrange distribution inside the nucleon. However,
previous calculations are still too small to explain the experimental data.
From a realistic consideration of quark to $\Lambda$ fragmentation due to

of the nucleon sea can be amplified into an observable quantity from the
difference between $\Lambda$ and $\bar\Lambda$ polarizations after taking into
account the larger probability of the $\Lambda$ produced from the $s$ quark
fragmentation process compared to that from the $u$ or $d$ quark. The
qualitative agreement between our calculation and the experimental data
supports the existence of the intrinsic strange sea and the strange-antistrange

window to probe the nucleon sea properties, especially the strange content and
its quark-antiquark asymmetry.

non-degenerate algebra $A$, with or without identity, and a coproduct $\Delta$
on $A$, satisfying certain properties. The main difference with multiplier Hopf
algebras is that now, the canonical maps $T_1$ and $T_2$ on $A\otimes A$,
defined by $$T_1(a\otimes b)=\Delta(a)(1\otimes b)
\qquad\quad\text{and}\qquad\quad T_2(c\otimes a)=(c\otimes 1)\Delta(a),$$ are
no longer assumed to be bijective. Also recall that a weak multiplier Hopf
algebra is called regular if its antipode is a bijective map from $A$ to
itself.
  In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of integrals on such regular
weak multiplier Hopf algebras. A left integral is a non-zero linear functional
on $A$ that is left invariant (in an appropriate sense). Similarly for a right
integral. For a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra $(A,\Delta)$ with
(sufficiently many) integrals, we construct the dual $(\widehat
A,\widehat\Delta)$. It is again a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra with
(sufficiently many) integrals. This duality extends the known duality of
finite-dimensional weak Hopf algebras to this more general case. It also
extends the duality of multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals, the so-called
algebraic quantum groups. For this reason, we will sometimes call a regular
weak multiplier Hopf algebra with enough integrals an algebraic quantum
groupoid.
  We discuss the relation of our work with the work on duality for algebraic
quantum groupoids by Timmermann.
  We also illustrate this duality with a particular example in a separate
paper. In this paper, we only mention the main definitions and results for this
example. However, we do consider the two natural weak multiplier Hopf algebras
associated with a groupoid in detail and show that they are dual to each other

is binary constant subblock-composition codes (CSCCs), where each codeword is

that the asymptotic rates for CSCCs is strictly lower than that of SECCs, which

branes with opposite brane tensions, but the four-dimensional graviton (the
gravity zero mode) is localized near the negative tension brane, while our
four-dimensional universe is localized on the positive tension brane. In this
paper, we consider the mass spectra of various bulk matter fields (i.e.,
scalar, vector, and fermion fields) on the Weyl brane. It is shown that the
zero modes of those matter fields can be localized on the positive tension
brane under some conditions. The mass spectra of the bulk matter fields are
equidistant for the higher excited states, and relatively sparse for the lower
excited states. The size of the extra dimension determines the gap of the mass
spectra. We also consider the correction to the Newtonian potential in this
model and it is proportional to $1/r^{3}$.

predicted by their formation energies. The results show that silicon vacancies
are more prone to be produced than uranium vacancies in \b{eta}-USi2 matrix,
while uranium vacancies are the most stable defects of other three types of
crystallographic structures. The most favorable sites of fission products
(strontium, barium, cerium and neodymium) are determined in this work as well.
By calculating incorporation energies of fission products, we demonstrate that
the uranium site is the most favored for all the fissions products. Comparing

found that the highest volume change is caused by barium interstitials.
According to the current data, rare earth elements cerium and neodymium are

  Problems - Properties and Limitations",,,,,"math.ST math.NA math.OC stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper discusses the properties of certain risk estimators recently
proposed to choose regularization parameters in ill-posed problems. A simple
approach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in
the data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the
space of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more
appropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do
not tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical
studies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite
dimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also
leads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends
to infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with
a very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the
risk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical
results indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate
asymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed
numerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads
to extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize
the reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness
also appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather
conservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization
parameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure
for ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization
demonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational
regularization approaches.

transfer from the photosphere to the corona through the magnetic fields and its
energy conversion by various processes. However, quantitative estimation of
energy transfer along the magnetic field is not enough. There are mainly two
reason why it is difficult to observe the energy transfer from photosphere to
corona; 1) spatial resolution gap between photosphere (a few 0.1 arcsec) and
corona (a few arcsec), 2) lack in temperature coverage. Furthermore, there is
not enough observational knowledge of the physical parameters in the energy
dissipation region. There are mainly three reason why it is difficult to
observe in the vicinity of the energy dissipation region; 1) small spatial
scale, 2) short time scale, 3) low emission. It is generally believed that the
energy dissipation occurs in the very small scale and its duration is very
short (10 second). Further, the density in the dissipation region might be very
low. Therefore, the high spatial and temporal resolution UV/EUV spectroscopic

solvents, an external electric field can alter the local mixture composition
thereby accelerating or decelerating the rate of reaction. The spatial
distribution of electric field strength can be non-trivial and depends on the
arrangement of the electrodes producing it. In the absence of electric field,
the mixture is homogeneous and the reaction takes place uniformly in the
reactor volume. When an electric field is applied the solvents separate and
reactants are concentrated in the same phase or separate to different phases,
depending on their relative miscibility in the solvents, and this can have a
large effect on the kinetics of the reaction. This method could provide an

space of control signals to the space of corresponding future states.
Consequently, stochastic dynamic systems can be interpreted as an information
channel between the control space and the state space. In this work we study
this control-to-state informartion capacity of stochastic dynamic systems in
continuous-time, when the states are observed only partially. The
control-to-state capacity, known as empowerment, was shown in the past to be
useful in solving various Artificial Intelligence & Control benchmarks, and was
used to replace problem-specific utilities. The higher the value of empowerment
is, the more optional future states an agent may reach by using its controls
inside a given time horizon. The contribution of this work is that we derive an
efficient solution for computing the control-to-state information capacity for
a linear, partially-observed Gaussian dynamic control system in continuous
time, and discover new relationships between control-theoretic and
information-theoretic properties of dynamic systems. Particularly, using the
derived method, we demonstrate that the capacity between the control signal and
the system output does not grow without limits with the length of the control
signal. This means that only the near-past window of the control signal
contributes effectively to the control-to-state capacity, while most of the
information beyond this window is irrelevant for the future state of the
dynamic system. We show that empowerment depends on a time constant of a
dynamic system.

distinguishes the layers (other than their individual thickness and initial
drug loading) is the underlying microstructure, and in particular the effective
porosity and the tortuosity of the material. We consider the effect on the drug
release profile of varying the initial distribution of drug, the relative
thickness of the layers and the relative resistance to diffusion offered by
each layer's composition. Our results indicate that the contrast in properties
of the two layers can be used as a means of better controlling the release, and
that the quantity of drug delivered in the early stages can be modulated by
varying the distribution of drug across the layers. We conclude that
microstructural and loading differences between multi-layer variable porosity

the desired drug release profile for a given application.

identified type-B QPOs. To enlarge the sample, we also investigated some type-B
QPOs that are reported but not yet fully identified. Regarding to the time lag
and hard/soft flux ratio, we found that the sources with type-B QPOs behave in
two subgroups. In one subgroup, type-B QPO shows a hard time lag that firstly
decreases and then reverse into a soft time lag along with softening of the
energy spectrum. In the other subgroup, type-B QPOs distribute only in a small
region with hard time lag and relatively soft hardness. These findings may be
understood with a diversity of the homogeneity showing up for the hot inner
flow of different sources. We confirm the universality of a positive relation
between the type-B QPO frequency and the hard component luminosity in different
sources. We explain the results by considering that the type-B QPO photons are
produced in the inner accretion flow around the central black hole, under a
local Eddington limit. Using this relationship, we derived an mass estimation
of $9.3-27.1$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ for the black hole in H 1743-322.

characteristic behavior in the algebraically decaying spin density correlation

indicate a fractionalized quasi-condensate where the mean-field degeneracy of

  Landmark Retrieval","Accepted to Appear in IEEE Trans on Image Processing",,"10.1109/TIP.2017.2655449",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a query photo issued by a user (q-user), the landmark retrieval is to
return a set of photos with their landmarks similar to those of the query,
while the existing studies on the landmark retrieval focus on exploiting
geometries of landmarks for similarity matches between candidate photos and a
query photo. We observe that the same landmarks provided by different users
over social media community may convey different geometry information depending
on the viewpoints and/or angles, and may subsequently yield very different
results. In fact, dealing with the landmarks with \illshapes caused by the
photography of q-users is often nontrivial and has seldom been studied. In this
paper we propose a novel framework, namely multi-query expansions, to retrieve
semantically robust landmarks by two steps. Firstly, we identify the top-$k$
photos regarding the latent topics of a query landmark to construct multi-query
set so as to remedy its possible \illshape. For this purpose, we significantly
extend the techniques of Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, motivated by the
typical \emph{collaborative filtering} methods, we propose to learn a
\emph{collaborative} deep networks based semantically, nonlinear and high-level
features over the latent factor for landmark photo as the training set, which
is formed by matrix factorization over \emph{collaborative} user-photo matrix
regarding the multi-query set. The learned deep network is further applied to
generate the features for all the other photos, meanwhile resulting into a
compact multi-query set within such space. Extensive experiments are conducted
on real-world social media data with both landmark photos together with their
user information to show the superior performance over the existing methods.

spectral band and its spectral response interacts with the sky's spectrum in a
complex manner. This is why the optical signals are difficult to interpret when
the data are recorded in regions with different sources of artificial light.
The brightness of the night sky is linked in a complex way to ground-based
light emissions while taking into account atmospheric-induced optical
distortion as well as spectral transformation from the underlying ground
surfaces. While the spectral modulation of the sky's radiance has been
recognized, it still remains poorly characterized and quantified. The impact of
the SQM's spectral characteristics on the sky brightness measurements is here
analysed for different light sources, including low and high pressure sodium
lamps, PC-amber and white LEDs, metal halide, and mercury lamps. We show that a
routine conversion of radiance to magnitude is difficult or rather impossible

conditions, the spectrum of the source, and device specific properties. We
correlate SQM readings with both the Johnson astronomical photometry bands and

to be inhomogeneous. The interaction of these inhomogeneities, or clumps, with

goal is to characterize a typical scenario of clump-jet interaction, and
calculate the contribution of these interactions to the gamma-ray emission from
these systems. We use axisymmetric, RHD simulations to model the emitting flow
in a typical clump-jet interaction. Using the simulation results we perform a
numerical calculation of the high-energy emission from one of these
interactions. The radiative calculations are done for relativistic electrons
locally accelerated at the jet shock, and the synchrotron and IC radiation
spectra are computed for different stages of the shocked clump evolution. We
also explore different parameter values, such as viewing angle and magnetic
field strength. We generalize phenomenologically the results derived from one
clump-jet interaction to multiple interactions under different wind models,
estimating the clump-jet interaction rates, and the resulting luminosities in
the GeV range. If particles are efficiently accelerated in clump-jet
interactions, the apparent gamma-ray luminosity through IC scattering with the
stellar photons can be significant even for rather strong magnetic fields and
thus efficient synchrotron cooling. Moreover, despite the standing nature or
slow motion of the jet shocks for most of the interaction stage, Doppler
boosting in the postshock flow is relevant even for mildly relativistic jets.
For clump-to-average wind density contrasts $\gtrsim 10$, clump-jet
interactions could be bright enough to match the observed GeV luminosity in
Cyg~X-1 and Cyg~X-3 when a jet is present in these sources, with required
non-thermal-to-total available power fractions $\sim 0.01$ and $0.1$,

sometimes no asymptotically extremal family is the union of levels.

we find that near the glass transition for this system (which coincides with
the Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation is perfectly

kinematics of the molecular gas in this feature can be interpreted (albeit not
uniquely) as accelerating at a rate of 1 km s^-1 pc^-1. In this scenario, the
gas is approaching escape velocity at the last measured point. Strikingly,
bright tracers of dense molecular gas (HCN, CN, HCO+, CS) are also detected in
the molecular outflow: We measure an HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) line ratio of ~1/10 in
the outflow, similar to that in the central starburst region of NGC 253 and
other starburst galaxies. By contrast, the HCN/CO line ratio in the NGC 253

vibrational density of states (DOS) as input, that we take from numerical
evaluation of a marginally-stable harmonic disordered lattice, featuring a
strong boson peak (excess of soft modes over Debye $\sim\omega_{p}^{2}$ law).
The dielectric function calculated based on this ansatz is compared with
experimental data for the paradigmatic case of glycerol at $T\lesssim T_{g}$.
Good agreement is found for both the reactive (real part) of the response and
for the $\alpha$-relaxation peak in the imaginary part, with a significant
improvement over earlier theoretical approaches, especially in the reactive
modulus. On the low-frequency side of the $\alpha$-peak, the fitting supports
the presence of $\sim \omega_{p}^{4}$ modes at vanishing eigenfrequency as
recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 035501 (2016)]. $\alpha$-wing
asymmetry and stretched-exponential behaviour are recovered by our framework,
which shows that these features are, to a large extent, caused by the soft
boson-peak modes in the DOS.

that it continues to have the appearance of a type-1 Seyfert galaxy. An optical
light curve for 2010-2016 indicates that the change of type probably occurred
between 2010 October and 2012 February and was not related to the brightening
in 2013. In 2016 NGC 2617 brightened again to a level of activity close to that
in 2013 April. We find variations in all passbands and in both the intensities
and profiles of the broad Balmer lines. A new displaced emission peak has
appeared in H$\beta$. X-ray variations are well correlated with UV-optical
variability and possibly lead by $\sim$ 2-3 d. The $K$ band lags the $J$ band
by about 21.5 $\pm$ 2.5 d. and lags the combined $B+J$ filters by $\sim$ 25 d.
$J$ lags $B$ by about 3 d. This could be because $J$-band variability arises
from the outer part of the accretion disc, while $K$-band variability comes
from thermal re-emission by dust. We propose that spectral-type changes are a
result of increasing central luminosity causing sublimation of the innermost
dust in the hollow biconical outflow. We briefly discuss various other possible
reasons that might explain the dramatic changes in NGC 2617.

  Surface Science in 2017",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Plasmons in low-dimensional systems respresent an important tool for coupling
energy into nanostructures and the localization of energy on the scale of only
a few nanometers. Contrary to ordinary surface plasmons of metallic bulk
materials, their dispersion goes to zero in the long wavelength limit, thus
covering a broad range of energies from terahertz to near infrared, and from
mesoscopic wavelengths down to just a few nanometers. Using specific and most
characteristic examples, we review first the properties of plasmons in
two-dimensional (2D) metallic layers from an experimental point of view. As
demonstrated, tuning of their dispersion is possible by changes of charge
carrier concentration in the partially filled 2D conduction bands, but for the
relativistic electron gas like in graphene only in the long wavelength limit.
For short wavelengths, on the other hand, the dispersion turns out to be
independent of the position of the Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point.
A linear dispersion, seen under the latter conditions in graphene, can also be
obtained in non-relativistic electron gases by coupling between 2D and 3D
electronic systems. As a well investigated example, the acoustic surface
plasmons in Shockley surface states, coupled with the bulk electronic system,
are discussed. Also the introduction of anisotropy, e.g. by regular arrays of
steps, seems to result in linearization (and to partial localization of the
plasmons normal to the steps, depending on wavelengths). In quasi-one
dimensional (1D) systems, such as arrays of gold chains on regularly stepped Si
surfaces, only the dispersion is 1D, whereas shape and slope of the dispersion
curves depend on the 2D distribution of charge within each terrace and on
coupling between wires on different terraces.

a suitable detector, in such a way that the visibility of the interference
pattern provides a quantitative expression of the amount of coherence in a

measures from visibility, and demonstrate it by analysing several concrete

the snapshot computation in the offline phase of model order reduction
utilizing Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD-MOR) for nonlinear parabolic
evolution problems. We consider snapshots which live in different finite
element spaces, which means in a fully discrete setting that the snapshots are
vectors of different length. From a numerical point of view, this leads to the
problem that the usual POD procedure which utilizes a singular value
decomposition of the snapshot matrix, cannot be carried out. In order to
overcome this problem, we here construct the POD model / basis using the
eigensystem of the correlation matrix (snapshot gramian), which is motivated
from a continuous perspective and is set up explicitly e.g. without the
necessity of interpolating snapshots into a common finite element space. It is
an advantage of this approach that the assembling of the matrix only requires
the evaluation of inner products of snapshots in a common Hilbert space. This
allows a great flexibility concerning the spatial discretization of the
snapshots. The analysis for the error between the resulting POD solution and
the true solution reveals that the accuracy of the reduced order solution can
be estimated by the spatial and temporal discretization error as well as the
POD error. Finally, to illustrate the feasibility our approach, we present a
test case of the Cahn-Hilliard system utilizing h-adapted hierarchical meshes
and two settings of a linear heat equation using nested and non-nested grids.

To reduce the execution latency and device energy consumption, in this paper,
we jointly optimize task offloading scheduling and transmit power allocation
for MEC systems with multiple independent tasks. A low-complexity sub-optimal
algorithm is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of the execution delay and
device energy consumption based on alternating minimization. Specifically,
given the transmit power allocation, the optimal task offloading scheduling,
i.e., to determine the order of offloading, is obtained with the help of flow
shop scheduling theory. Besides, the optimal transmit power allocation with a
given task offloading scheduling decision will be determined using convex
optimization techniques. Simulation results show that task offloading
scheduling is more critical when the available radio and computational
resources in MEC systems are relatively balanced. In addition, it is shown that
the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal execution delay along with a

topologically trivial. Recently, an ensemble of 1D Floquet systems, double
kicked rotors (DKRs) depending on an external parameter, has been studied. It
was shown that a QE band spanned by both the Bloch phase and the external
parameter is characterized by a Chern integer, which determines the change in
the mean angular momentum of a state in a band when the external parameter is
adiabatically varied by a natural period. We show here, under conditions much
more general than in previous works, that the ensemble of DKRs for all values
of the external parameter is fully described by a system having translational
invariance on the phase plane. This system can be characterized by a
\emph{second} Chern integer which is shown to be connected with the integer
above for the DKR ensemble. This connection is expressed by a Diophantine
equation (DE) which we derive. The DE, involving the number of QE bands and the
degeneracy of the QE states of the phase-plane system, limits the values of the
DKR-ensemble integer. In particular, this integer is generically nonzero,
showing the general topological nontriviality of the DKR ensemble.

exceptionally weak but also has a unique geometry. The internal field resembles
an axial dipole that is offset to the North by 20% of the planetary radius.
This implies that the axial quadrupol is particularly strong while the dipole
tilt is likely below 0.8 degree. The close proximity to the sun in combination
with the weak internal field results in a very small and highly dynamic Hermean
magnetosphere. We review the current understanding of Mercury's internal and
external magnetic field and discuss possible explanations. Classical convection
driven core dynamos have a hard time to reproduce the observations. Strong
quadrupol contributions can be promoted by different measures, but they always
go along with a large dipole tilt and generally rather small scale fields. A
stably stratified outer core region seems required to explain not only the
particular geometry but also the weakness of the Hermean magnetic field. New
interior models suggest that Mercury's core likely hosts an iron snow zone
underneath the core-mantle boundary. The positive radial sulfur gradient likely
to develop in such a zone would indeed promote stable stratification. However,
even dynamo models that include the stable layer show Mercury-like magnetic
fields only for a fraction of the total simulation time. Large scale variations
in the core-mantle boundary heat flux promise to yield more persistent results
but are not compatible with the current understanding of Mercury's lower
mantle.

particles, and arises in models of cell division, protein polymerisation and
even telecommunications protocols. Several important questions about the
equation concern the asymptotic behaviour of solutions at large times: at what
rate do they converge to zero or infinity, and what does the asymp-totic
profile of the solutions look like? Does the rescaled solution converge to its
asymptotic profile at an exponential speed? These questions have traditionally
been studied using analytic techniques such as entropy methods or splitting of
operators. In this work, we present a probabilistic approach to the study of
this asymptotic behaviour. We use a Feynman--Kac formula to relate the solution
of the growth-fragmentation equation to the semigroup of a Markov process, and
characterise the rate of decay or growth in terms of this process. We then
identify the spectral radius and the asymptotic profile in terms of a related
Markov process, and give a spectral interpretation in terms of the
growth-fragmentation operator and its dual. In special cases, we obtain
exponential convergence.

have often been faced with the opposing position that 'some infinite totalities

infinitesimals (versus less controversial infinite totalities). For instance,
Bishop and Connes have made such claims regarding infinitesimals, and
Nonstandard Analysis in general, going as far as calling the latter
respectively a debasement of meaning and virtual, while accepting as meaningful
other infinite totalities and the associated mathematical framework.
  We shall study the critique of Nonstandard Analysis by Bishop and Connes, and
observe that these authors equate 'meaning' and 'computational content', though
their interpretations of said content vary. As we will see, Bishop and Connes
claim that the presence of ideal objects (in particular infinitesimals) in

approximation of the micro part, a splitting between the transport and the

prevent from uniform stability. To overcome this difficulty, the micro-macro
system is reformulated into a continuous PDE whose coefficients are no longer
stiff, and depend on the time step $\Delta t$ in a consistent way. This
non-stiff reformulation of the micro-macro system allows the use of standard
particle approximations for the transport part, and extends the work in [5]
where a particle approximation has been applied using a micro-macro
decomposition on kinetic equations in the fluid scaling. Beyond the so-called

significantly reduce the inherent noise of traditional particle methods, and
they have a computational cost which decreases as the system approaches the

prominent feature to reveal high coordination among multiple chemical sites on

chemical reaction and central {\gamma}-shaft rotation. High-speed AFM
experiments discovered that the sequential hydrolysis was maintained on the F1
ring even in the absence of the {\gamma} rotor. To explore how the intrinsic
sequential performance arises, we computationally investigated essential
inter-subunit couplings on the hexameric ring of mitochondrial and bacterial
F1. We first reproduced the sequential hydrolysis schemes as experimentally
detected, by simulating tri-site ATP hydrolysis cycles on the F1 ring upon
kinetically imposing inter-subunit couplings to substantially promote the
hydrolysis products release. We found that it is key for certain ATP binding
and hydrolysis events to facilitate the neighbor-site ADP and Pi release to
support the sequential hydrolysis. The kinetically feasible couplings were then
scrutinized through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations as well as
coarse-grained simulations, in which we enforced targeted conformational
changes for the ATP binding or hydrolysis. Notably, we detected the
asymmetrical neighbor-site opening that would facilitate the ADP release upon
the enforced ATP binding, and computationally captured the complete Pi release

modulus covering frequencies from 10 mHz to 30 kHz and temperatures from 168 K

data reveal a strong mechanical beta process. A model is proposed for the shear
response of supercooled liquids. The model is an electrical equivalent-circuit
characterized by additivity of the dynamic shear compliances of the alpha and
beta processes. The nontrivial parts of the alpha and beta processes are
represented by a ""Cole-Cole retardation element"", resulting in the Cole-Cole
compliance function well-known from dielectrics. The model, which assumes that
the high-frequency decay of the alpha shear compliance loss varies with angular
frequency as $\omega^{-1/2}$, has seven parameters. Assuming time-temperature
superposition for the alpha and the beta processes separately, the number of
parameters varying with temperature is reduced to four. From the temperature
dependence of the best-fit model parameters the following conclusions are
drawn: 1) the alpha relaxation time conforms to the shoving model; 2) the beta
relaxation loss-peak frequency is almost temperature independent; 3) the alpha
compliance magnitude, which in the model equals the inverse of the
instantaneous shear modulus, is only weakly temperature dependent; 4) the beta
compliance magnitude decreases by a factor of three upon cooling in the
temperature range studied. The final part of the paper briefly presents
measurements of the dynamic adiabatic bulk modulus covering frequencies from 10
mHz to 10 kHz in the temperature range 172 K to 200 K. The data are
qualitatively similar to the shear data by having a significant beta process. A
single-order-parameter framework is suggested to rationalize these
similarities.

prove remarkably robust extending to the fifth cation-oxygen shell about 8

packing preferences and charge neutrality in the ground state, and the approach

in the literature, but each has been qualified as 'spurious', somehow blurring
their differences. Consequently, in an effort to clarify the consequences of
choosing a particular viscous damping model for nonlinear RHA, this paper shows
that damping models that avoid spurious damping forces of one type do not
necessarily avoid damping forces of the other type.

>= 1 suffices, as does e.g. the Cantor space. In particular, intuitionistic
logic cannot detect topological dimension in the frame of all open sets of a
Euclidean space. By contrast, we consider the lattice of open subpolyhedra of a
given compact polyhedron P \subseteq R^n, prove that it is a locally finite
Heyting subalgebra of the (non-locally-finite) algebra of all open sets of R^n,

of P through the bounded-depth axiom schemata. Further, we show that
intuitionistic logic is precisely the logic of formul{\ae} valid in all Heyting

reconciles through polyhedral geometry two classical results: topological
completeness in the style of Tarski, and Jaskowski's theorem that
intuitionistic logic enjoys the finite model property. Several questions of

a two-dimensional system of interlaced particles. The particle interlacement
constraints imply that the equilibrium measures are far from being product
Bernoulli: particle correlations decay like the inverse distance squared and
interface height fluctuations behave on large scales like a massless Gaussian
field. We consider a particular choice of the transition rates, originally
proposed in [Luby-Randall-Sinclair]: in terms of interlaced particles, a
particle jump of length $n$ that preserves the interlacement constraints has
rate $1/(2n)$. This dynamics presents special features: the average mutual
volume between two interface configurations decreases with time and a certain
one-dimensional projection of the dynamics is described by the heat equation.
  In this work we prove a hydrodynamic limit: after a diffusive rescaling of
time and space, the height function evolution tends as $L\to\infty$ to the
solution of a non-linear parabolic PDE. The initial profile is assumed to be
$C^2$ differentiable and to contain no ""frozen region"". The explicit form of
the PDE was recently conjectured on the basis of local equilibrium
considerations. In contrast with the hydrodynamic equation for the Langevin

(BSDEs), whose coefficients not only depend on the value of its solutions of
the present but also the past and the future. For a sufficiently small time
delay or a sufficiently small Lipschitz constant, the existence and uniqueness
of such BSDEs is obtained. As an adjoint process, a class of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) is introduced, whose coefficients also depend on
the present, the past and the future of its solutions. The existence and
uniqueness of such SDEs is proved for a sufficiently small time advance or a
sufficiently small Lipschitz constant. A duality between such BSDEs and SDEs is
established.

have photonic band gaps around a finite number of given frequencies. In such
materials electromagnetic waves with these frequencies can not propagate; this
makes them interesting for a large number of applications. We focus on crystals
made of periodically ordered thin rods with high contrast dielectric
properties. We show that the material parameters can be chosen in such a way
that transverse magnetic modes with given frequencies can not propagate in the
crystal. At the same time, for any frequency belonging to a predefined range
there exists a transverse electric mode that can propagate in the medium. These
results are related to the spectral properties of a weighted Laplacian and of
an elliptic operator of divergence type both acting in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The
proofs rely on perturbation theory of linear operators, Floquet-Bloch analysis,
and properties of Schroedinger operators with point interactions.

  Control in Elections","Accepted for TAMC 2017",,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.

possibility to manipulate on ultrashort time scales and to provide local
excitation. However, a single laser pulse can inject spin waves only with a
broad frequency spectrum, resulting in a short propagation distance and low
amplitude. Here we excite a magnetic garnet film by a train of fs-laser pulses
with 1 GHz repetition rate so that pulse separation is smaller than decay time
of the magnetic modes which allows to achieve collective photonic impact on
magnetization. It establishes a quasi-stationary source of SWs, namely a
coherent magnon accumulation (""magnon cloud""). This approach has several
appealing features: (i) the source is tunable; (ii) the SW amplitude can be
significantly enhanced; (iii) the spectrum of the generated SWs is quite narrow
that provides longer propagation distance; (iv) the periodic pumping results in
almost constant in time SW amplitude up to 100 um away from the source; and (v)
the SW emission shows a pronounced directionality. These results expand the
capabilities of ultrafast coherent optical control of magnetization and pave a
way for applications in data processing, including the quantum regime. The
quasi-stationary magnon accumulation might be also of interest for the problem
of magnon Bose-Einstein condensate.

foundation and quantum technology. However, until now, all most of coherence
measures are basis-dependent that does not accord with physical reality, since
the physical properties of the physical system should not be changed with the
different choice of coordinate systems. Here, we propose an \textit{intrinsic
basis-independent quantum coherence measure} which satisfies all conditions for
quantifying coherence. This measurement not only reveals physical essence of
quantum coherence of the quantum state itself clearly, but also simplifies the
measurement procedure by avoiding the optimization procedure of distance
measure.

single crystals employing a novel electron energy loss spectroscopic set-up
composed by an electron microscope equipped with a monochromator and an
in-column filter. This set-up provides high-quality energy-loss spectra and
allows also for the imaging of energy-filtered diffraction patterns. These two
acquisition modes provide complementary pieces of information, offering a
global view of excitations in reciprocal space. As an example of the
capabilities of the method we show how easily the core loss spectra at the $K$
edges of boron and nitrogen can be measured and imaged. Low losses associated
to interband and/or plasmon excitations are also measured. This energy range
allows us to illustrate that our method provides results of quality comparable
to those obtained from non resonant X-ray inelastic scattering, but with
advantageous specificities such as an enhanced sensitivity at low q and a much
higher simplicity and versatility that makes it well adapted to the study of
two-dimensional materials and related heterostructures. Finally, by comparing
theoretical calculations against our measures, we are able to relate the range
of applicability of ab initio calculations to the anisotropy of the sample and
assess the level of approximation required for a proper simulation of our

present the interaction of two filaments (F1 and F2) in a long filament channel
associated with twin coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on 2016 January 26. Before
the eruption, a sequence of rapid cancellation and emergence of the magnetic
flux has been observed, which likely triggered the ascending of the west
filament (F1). The east footpoints of rising F1 moved toward the east far end
of the filament channel, accompanying with post-eruption loops and flare
ribbons. It likely indicated a large-scale eruption involving the long filament
channel, resulted from the interaction between F1 and the east filament (F2).
Some bright plasma flew over F2, and F2 stayed at rest during the eruption,
likely due to the confinement of its overlying lower magnetic field.
Interestingly, the impulsive F1 pushed its overlying magnetic arcades to form
the first CME, and F1 finally evolved into the second CME after the collision
with the nearby coronal hole. We suggest that the interaction of F1 and the
overlying magnetic field of F2 led to the merging reconnection that form a
longer eruptive filament loop. Our results also provide a possible picture of
the origin of twin CMEs, and show the large-scale magnetic topology of the
coronal hole is important for the eventual propagation direction of CMEs.

  Management in 5G Networks",,,,,"cs.GT cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most promising approaches to overcome the uncertainty and dynamic
channel variations of millimeter wave (mmW) communications is to deploy
dual-mode base stations that integrate both mmW and microwave ($\mu$W)
frequencies. If properly designed, such dual-mode base stations can enhance
mobility and handover in highly mobile wireless environments. In this paper, a
novel approach for analyzing and managing mobility in joint $\mu$W-mmW networks
is proposed. The proposed approach leverages device-level caching along with
the capabilities of dual-mode base stations to minimize handover failures,
reduce inter-frequency measurement energy consumption, and provide seamless
mobility in emerging dense heterogeneous networks. First, fundamental results
on the caching capabilities, including caching probability and cache duration
are derived for the proposed dual-mode network scenario. Second, the average
achievable rate of caching is derived for mobile users. Third, the proposed
cache-enabled mobility management problem is formulated as a dynamic matching
game between mobile user equipments (MUEs) and small base stations (SBSs). The
goal of this game is to find a distributed handover mechanism that subject to
the network constraints on HOFs and limited cache sizes, allows each MUE to
choose between executing an HO to a target SBS, being connected to the
macrocell base station (MBS), or perform a transparent HO by using the cached
content. The formulated matching game allows capturing the dynamics of the
mobility management problem caused by HOFs. To solve this dynamic matching
problem, a novel algorithm is proposed and its convergence to a two-sided
dynamically stable HO policy is proved. Numerical results corroborate the
analytical derivations and show that the proposed solution will provides
significant reductions in both the HOF and energy consumption by MUEs.

azimuthally unidirectional transport of energy in a MDM resonance ferrite

(i.e. intervals) representing birth and death times of k-dimensional holes
along such sequence is called the persistence barcode. k-Dimensional holes with
short lifetimes are informally considered to be ""topological noise"", and those
with long lifetimes are considered to be ""topological features"" associated to
the filtration. Persistent entropy is defined as the Shannon entropy of the
persistence barcode of a given filtration. In this paper we present new
important properties of persistent entropy of Cech and Vietoris-Rips
filtrations. Among the properties, we put a focus on the stability theorem that
allows to use persistent entropy for comparing persistence barcodes. Later, we
derive a simple method for separating topological noise from features in
Vietoris-Rips filtrations.

Timashev","The Planck numbers and the essence of gravitation: phenomenology","24 pages; Added section 5",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce phenomenological understanding of the electromagnetic component
of the physical vacuum, the EM vacuum, as a basic medium for all masses of the
expanding Universe, and ""Casimir polarization"" of this medium arising in the
vicinity of any material object in the Universe as a result of conjugation of
the electric field components of the EM vacuum on both sides (""external"" and
""internal"") of atomic nucleus boundary of the each mass with vacuum. It is
shown that the gravitational attraction of two material objects in accordance
with Newton's law of gravity arises as a result of overlapping of the domains
of the EM vacuum Casimir polarization created by atomic nuclei of the objects,
taking into account the long-range gravitational influence of all masses of the
Universe on each nucleus of these objects (Mach's idea). Newton's law of
gravitational attraction between two bodies is generalized to the case of
gravitational interaction of a system of bodies when the center of mass of the
pair of bodies shifted relative to the center of mass of the system. The unique
smallness of gravitational interactions as compared with the fundamental
nuclear (strong and weak) and electromagnetic ones is determined by the ratio
of the characteristic size of the domain of EM vacuum Casimir polarization in
the vicinity of atomic nuclei to the Hubble radius of the Universe.

  error in figure 1",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a real-time 105-channel data acquisition platform based on
FPGA for imaging will be implemented for mm-wave imaging systems. PC platform
is also realized for imaging results monitoring purpose. Mm-wave imaging
expands our vision by letting us see things under poor visibility conditions.
With this extended vision ability, a wide range of military imaging missions
would benefit, such as surveillance, precision targeting, navigation, and
rescue. Based on the previously designed imager modules, this project would go
on finishing the PCB design (both schematic and layout) of the following signal
processing systems consisting of Programmable Gain Amplifier(PGA) (4 PGA for
each ADC) and 16-channel Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) (7 ADC in total).
Then the system verification would be performed on the Artix-7 35T Arty FPGA
with the developing of proper controlling code to configure the ADC and realize
the communication between the FPGA and the PC (through both UART and Ethernet).
For the verification part, a simple test on a breadboard with a simple analog
input (generated from a resistor divider) would first be performed. After the
PCB design is finished, the whole system would be tested again with a precise
reference and analog input.

richness of data to answer specific questions often encountered by data
scientists. We first approach the problem in its full generality explaining its
desired mathematical properties and applications and then we propose and study
two DRL metrics. Specifically, we define DRL as a function of at least four
properties of data: Noisiness, Believability, Relevance, and Coherence. The
information-theoretic based metrics, Cosine Similarity and Document Disparity,
are proposed as indicators of Relevance and Coherence for a piece of data. The
proposed metrics are validated through a text-based experiment using Twitter
data.

dynamics of multiscale complex systems. The probability density function of the
relevant time series (signal) is represented as a statistical superposition of
a large time-scale distribution weighted by the distribution of certain
internal variables that characterize the slowly changing background. The
dynamics of the background is formulated as a hierarchical stochastic model
whose form is derived from simple physical constraints, which in turn restrict
the dynamics to only two possible classes. The probability distributions of
both the signal and the background have simple representations in terms of
Meijer G-functions. The two universality classes for the background dynamics
manifest themselves in the signal distribution as two types of tails: power law
and stretched exponential, respectively. A detailed analysis of empirical data
from classical turbulence and financial markets shows excellent agreement with
the theory.
