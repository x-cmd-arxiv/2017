triggered a range of initial investigations into their utility for visual place
recognition, all using generic features from networks that were trained for
other types of recognition tasks. In this paper, we train, at large scale, two
CNN architectures for the specific place recognition task and employ a
multi-scale feature encoding method to generate condition- and
viewpoint-invariant features. To enable this training to occur, we have
developed a massive Specific PlacEs Dataset (SPED) with hundreds of examples of
place appearance change at thousands of different places, as opposed to the
semantic place type datasets currently available. This new dataset enables us
to set up a training regime that interprets place recognition as a
classification problem. We comprehensively evaluate our trained networks on
several challenging benchmark place recognition datasets and demonstrate that
they achieve an average 10% increase in performance over other place
recognition algorithms and pre-trained CNNs. By analyzing the network responses
and their differences from pre-trained networks, we provide insights into what
a network learns when training for place recognition, and what these results
signify for future research in this area.

linear regression models. The approach is a computational algorithm motivated
from the KKT conditions for the $\ell_0$-penalized least squares solutions. It
generates a sequence of solutions iteratively, based on support detection using
primal and dual information and root finding. We refer to the algorithm as SDAR
for brevity. Under a sparse Rieze condition on the design matrix and certain
other conditions, we show that with high probability, the $\ell_2$ estimation
error of the solution sequence decays exponentially to the minimax error bound
in $O(\sqrt{J}\log(R))$ steps; and under a mutual coherence condition and
certain other conditions, the $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error decays to the
optimal error bound in $O(\log(R))$ steps, where $J$ is the number of important
predictors, $R$ is the relative magnitude of the nonzero target coefficients.
Computational complexity analysis shows that the cost of SDAR is $O(np)$ per
iteration. Moreover the oracle least squares estimator can be exactly recovered
with high probability at the same cost if we know the sparsity level. We also
consider an adaptive version of SDAR to make it more practical in applications.
Numerical comparisons with Lasso, MCP and greedy methods demonstrate that SDAR
is competitive with or outperforms them in accuracy and efficiency.

fundamental task in simulations and games. A navigation mesh is a data

is a navigation mesh based on the medial axis. It enables path planning for
disk-shaped characters of any radius.
  In this paper, we formally extend the medial axis (and therefore the ECM) to
3D environments in which characters are constrained to walkable surfaces.
Typical examples of such environments are multi-storey buildings, train
stations, and sports stadiums. We give improved definitions of a walkable
environment (WE: a description of walkable surfaces in 3D) and a multi-layered
environment (MLE: a subdivision of a WE into connected layers). We define the
medial axis of such environments based on projected distances on the ground

the medial axis has size $O(n)$, and we present an improved algorithm that
constructs the medial axis in $O(n \log n \log k)$ time.
  The medial axis can be annotated with nearest-obstacle information to obtain
the ECM navigation mesh. Our implementations show that the ECM can be computed
efficiently for large 2D and multi-layered environments, and that it can be
used to compute paths within milliseconds. This enables simulations of large

with previous works by other groups, we identify liquid-crystalline ordering
behaviour similar to that of two-dimensional hard rectangular particles subject
to thermal equilibrium fluctuations. However, due to dissipation, there is a
much stronger tendency for particles to cluster into parallel arrangements in
the granular system. These clusters behave as a polydisperse mixture of long
life-time `superparticles', and some aspects of the system behaviour can be
understood by applying mean-field theories for equilibrium hard rectangles,
based on two-body correlations, to these `superparticles'. Many other features
of the granular system are different: (i) For small particle length-to-breadth
ratio $\kappa$, we identify tetratic ordering at moderate packing fractions and
smectic fluctuations at higher packing fractions, with no sharp transition
between the two states. Both types of ordering can be explained in terms of
clustering. (ii) For large $\kappa$, strong clustering precludes the
stabilisation of a uniaxial nematic state, and the system exhibits a mixture of
randomly-oriented clusters which, as packing fraction is increased, develops
into states with smectic fluctuations, again through a diffuse transition.
(iii) Vorticity excitations of the velocity field compete with smectic
ordering, causing dynamic fluctuations and the absence of steady states at high
densities; the tetratic state, by contrast, is very stiff against vorticity,
and long-standing steady states, spatially and orientationally homogeneous
except for four symmetrical defects located close to the wall, can be observed.

poses both practical andtheoretical problems when we aim to empirically test
the theory by computingintegrated information from neuronal signals. For
example, measuring integratedinformation requires observing all the elements in
the considered system at the sametime, but this is practically rather
difficult. In addition, the interpretation of the spatialpartition needed to
compute integrated information becomes vague in continuous time-series
variables due to a general property of nonlinear dynamical systems known

byconsidering the topological dimensionality of shared attractor dynamics as an
indicatorof integrated information in continuous attractor dynamics. In this
formulation, theeffects of unobserved nodes on the attractor dynamics can be
reconstructed using atechnique called delay embedding, which allows us to
identify the dimensionality of anembedded attractor from partial observations.
We propose that the topologicaldimensionality represents a critical property of
integrated information, as it is invariantto general coordinate
transformations. We illustrate this new framework with simpleexamples and
discuss how it fits together with recent findings based on neuralrecordings
from awake and anesthetized animals. This topological approach extendsthe
existing notions of IIT to continuous dynamical systems and offers a
much-neededframework for testing the theory with experimental data by
substantially relaxing theconditions required for evaluating integrated

their corresponding influence on the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion system

classical probability theory. Given two independent systems, a natural question
is how to represent such a situation as a single test space. In other words,
how separate contextuality scenarios combine into a joint scenario. Under the
premise that the the allowed probabilistic models satisfy the No Signalling
principle, Foulis and Randall defined the unique possible way to compose two
contextuality scenarios. When composing strictly-more than two test spaces,
however, a variety of possible composition methods have been conceived.
Nevertheless, all these formally-distinct composition methods appear to give
rise to observationally equivalent scenarios, in the sense that the different
compositions all allow precisely the same sets of classical and quantum
probabilistic models. This raises the question of whether this property of
invariance-under-composition-method is special to classical and quantum
probabilistic models, or if it generalizes to other probabilistic models as
well, our particular focus being $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models. $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models
are physically important since, when applied to scenarios constructed by a
particular composition rule, coincide with the well-defined ""Almost Quantum
Correlations"". In this work we see that some composition rules, however, give
rise to scenarios with inequivalent allowed sets of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models. We
find that the non-trivial dependence of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models on the choice of
composition method is apparently an artifact of failure of those composition
rules to capture the orthogonality relations given by the Local Orthogonality
principle. We prove that $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models satisfy
invariance-under-composition-method for all the constructive compositions
protocols which do capture this notion of Local Orthogonality.

examines a less common, dynamic prize, model of prize linked savings and shows

false discovery rate (FDR) control, are derived from cross-weighting, a
data-splitting approach that enables learning the weight-covariate function
without overfitting as long as the hypotheses can be partitioned into
independent folds, with arbitrary within-fold dependence. IHW has increased
power compared to methods that do not use covariate information. A key
implication of IHW is that hypothesis rejection in common multiple testing
setups should not proceed according to the ranking of the p-values, but by an
alternative ranking implied by the covariate-weighted p-values.

(CDM) as it enables the detection and mass measurement of low mass haloes even
if they do not contain baryons. Compact lensed sources such as Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) are particularly sensitive to perturbing subhalos, but their use
as a test of CDM has been limited by the small number of systems which have
significant radio emission which is extended enough avoid significant lensing
by stars in the plane of the lens galaxy, and red enough to be minimally
affected by differential dust extinction. Narrow-line emission is a promising
alternative as it is also extended and, unlike radio, detectable in virtually
all optically selected AGN lenses. We present first results from a WFC3 grism
narrow-line survey of lensed quasars, for the quadruply lensed AGN HE0435-1223.
Using a forward modelling pipeline which enables us to robustly account for
spatial blending, we measure the [OIII] 5007 \AA~ flux ratios of the four
images. We find that the [OIII] fluxes and positions are well fit by a simple
smooth mass model for the main lens. Our data rule out a $M_{600}>10^{8}

arcseconds of each of the lensed images, where $M_{600}$ is the perturber mass
within its central 600 pc. The non-detection is broadly consistent with the
expectations of $\Lambda$CDM for a single system. The sensitivity achieved
demonstrates that powerful limits on the nature of dark matter can be obtained

cavity that is smaller, about 15 AU in radius, and whose surface density at 15
AU is $10^{3\pm1}$ times smaller than the surface density at 70 AU; the gas
density grades smoothly between these two radii. The CO isotopologue
observations rule out a sharp drop in gas surface density at 30 AU or a
double-drop model as found by previous modeling. Future observations are needed
to assess the nature of these gas and dust cavities, e.g., whether they are
opened by multiple as-yet-unseen planets or photoevaporation.

  Galaxies: the Case for Nuclear Star Cluster Coevolution","accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx845",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new model for the formation and evolution of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) in the RAMSES code using sink particles, improving over
previous work the treatment of gas accretion and dynamical evolution. This new
model is tested against a suite of high-resolution simulations of an isolated,
gas-rich, cooling halo. We study the effect of various feedback models on the
SMBH growth and its dynamics within the galaxy.
  In runs without any feedback, the SMBH is trapped within a massive bulge and
is therefore able to grow quickly, but only if the seed mass is chosen larger
than the minimum Jeans mass resolved by the simulation. We demonstrate that, in
the absence of supernovae (SN) feedback, the maximum SMBH mass is reached when
Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) heating balances gas cooling in the nuclear
region.
  When our efficient SN feedback is included, it completely prevents bulge
formation, so that massive gas clumps can perturb the SMBH orbit, and reduce
the accretion rate significantly. To overcome this issue, we propose an
observationally motivated model for the joint evolution of the SMBH and a
parent nuclear star cluster (NSC), which allows the SMBH to remain in the
nuclear region, grow fast and resist external perturbations. In this scenario,
however, SN feedback controls the gas supply and the maximum SMBH mass now
depends on the balance between AGN heating and gravity. We conclude that
SMBH/NSC co-evolution is crucial for the growth of SMBH in high-z galaxies, the
progenitors of massive elliptical today.

ground yield measurements of the microlensing parallax vector $\pi_{\rm E}$,
from which compact constraints on the microlens properties are derived,
including $\lesssim$25\% uncertainties on the lens mass and distance. With the
current sample, we demonstrate that the majority of microlenses are indeed in
the mass range of M dwarfs. The planet sensitivities of all 41 events in the
sample are calculated, from which we provide constraints on the planet
distribution function. In particular, assuming a planet distribution function
that is uniform in $\log{q}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, we
find a $95\%$ upper limit on the fraction of stars that host typical
microlensing planets of 49\%, which is consistent with previous studies. Based
on this planet-free sample, we develop the methodology to statistically study
the Galactic distribution of planets using microlensing parallax measurements.
Under the assumption that the planet distributions are the same in the bulge as
in the disk, we predict that $\sim$1/3 of all planet detections from the
microlensing campaigns with Spitzer should be in the bulge. This prediction
will be tested with a much larger sample, and deviations from it can be used to
constrain the abundance of planets in the bulge relative to the disk.

radial velocities into pulsational velocities. As the BW distances are linearly
proportional to the p-factor, its accurate calibration for Cepheids is of
critical importance for the reliability of their distance scale. We focus on
the observational determination of the p-factor of the long-period Cepheid RS
Pup (P = 41.5 days). This star is particularly important as this is one of the
brightest Cepheids in the Galaxy and an analog of the Cepheids used to
determine extragalactic distances. An accurate distance of 1910 +/- 80 pc (+/-
4.2%) has recently been determined for RS Pup using the light echoes
propagating in its circumstellar nebula. We combine this distance with new
VLTI/PIONIER interferometric angular diameters, photometry and radial
velocities to derive the p-factor of RS Pup using the code
Spectro-Photo-Interferometry of Pulsating Stars (SPIPS). We obtain p = 1.250

with measurements from the literature, the p-factor of RS Pup confirms the good
agreement of a constant p = 1.293 +/- 0.039 (+/-3.0%) model with the

pairs of dark matter produced through top quark loops with an associated

significantly increase the sensitivity to these models. Including dark matter

Continuum polarization of the sodium sample near maximum light displays a broad
range of values, from extremely polarized cases like SN 2006X to almost
unpolarized ones like SN 2011ae. The non--sodium sample shows, typically,
smaller polarization values. The continuum polarization of the sodium sample in
the 400--600 nm range is linear with wavelength and can be characterized by the
mean polarization (P$_{\rm{mean}}$). Its values span a wide range and show a
linear correlation with color, color excess, and extinction in the visual band.
Larger dispersion correlations were found with the equivalent width of the Na I
D and Ca II H & K lines, and also a noisy relation between P$_{\rm{mean}}$ and
$R_{V}$, the ratio of total to selective extinction. Redder SNe show stronger
continuum polarization, with larger color excesses and extinctions. We also

virtually unchanged out to several effective radii, even when considering the
steeper IMF values inferred out to ~3 effective radii. Their morphologies,
kinematics and density profiles are like those found in the z>2 massive

We find that there seems to exist a ""degree of relic"" that is related on how
far into the path to become one of these typical z~0 massive galaxies the
compact relic has undergone. This path is partly dictated by the environment
the galaxy lives in. For galaxies in rich environments, such as the previously
reported relic galaxy NGC1277, the most extreme properties (e.g. sizes, short
formation timescales, larger super-massive black holes) are expected, while
lower density environments will have galaxies with delayed and/or extended star
formations, slightly larger sizes and not that extreme black hole masses. The
confirmation of 3 relic galaxies up to a distance of 106Mpc implies a lower
limit in the number density of these red nuggets in the local universe of

surface. Techniques and approaches to characterizing such worlds are essential,
as performing a census of Earth-like planets that may or may not have life will
inform our understanding of how frequently life originates and is sustained on
worlds other than our own. Observational techniques like high contrast imaging
and transit spectroscopy can reveal key indicators of habitability for
exoplanets. Both polarization measurements and specular reflectance from oceans
(also known as ""glint"") can provide direct evidence for surface liquid water,
while constraining surface pressure and temperature (from moderate resolution
spectra) can indicate liquid water stability. Indirect evidence for
habitability can come from a variety of sources, including observations of
variability due to weather, surface mapping studies, and/or measurements of
water vapor or cloud profiles that indicate condensation near a surface.
Approaches to making the types of measurements that indicate habitability are
diverse, and have different considerations for the required wavelength range,
spectral resolution, maximum noise levels, stellar host temperature, and
observing geometry.

spectroscopically confirmed type 1 AGNs collected from Bo\""{o}tes, XMM-COSMOS,
XMM-XXL-North, and the SDSS quasars in the Swift/XRT footprint spanning over
four orders of magnitude in luminosity. We carefully examine how different
observational constraints impact the observed $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relations,
including the inclusion of X-ray non-detected objects, possible X-ray
absorption in type 1 AGNs, X-ray flux limits, and star formation contamination.
We find that the primary factor driving the different $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relations
reported in the literature is the X-ray flux limits for different studies. When
taking these effects into account, we find that the X-ray luminosity and mid-IR
luminosity (measured at rest-frame $6\mu m$, or $L_{6\mu m}$) of our sample of
type 1 AGNs follow a bilinear relation in the log-log plane: $\log L_X
=(0.84\pm0.03)\times\log L_{6\mu m}/10^{45}{\rm erg\;s^{-1}} + (44.60\pm0.01)$
for $L_{6\mu m} < 10^{44.79}{\rm erg\;s^{-1}} $, and $\log L_X =

for $L_{6\mu m} \geq 10^{44.79}{\rm erg\;s^{-1}} $. This suggests that the
luminous type 1 quasars have a shallower $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ correlation than the
approximately linear relations found in local Seyfert galaxies. This result is
consistent with previous studies reporting a luminosity-dependent
$L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relation, and implies that assuming a linear $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$
relation to infer the neutral gas column density for X-ray absorption might
overestimate the column densities in luminous quasars.

role of Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) in averting malaria-induced
mortalities in children, as well as its related cost in promoting the spread of
anti-malarial drug resistance. IPT, a malaria control strategy in which a full
curative dose of an antimalarial medication is administered to vulnerable
asymptomatic individuals at specified intervals, has been shown to have a
positive impact on reducing malaria transmission and deaths in children and
pregnant women. However, it can also promote drug resistance spread. Our
mathematical model is used to explore IPT effects on drug resistance in
holoendemic malaria regions while quantifying the benefits in deaths averted.
Our model includes both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of the
parasite as well as interactions between human hosts and mosquitoes. The basic
reproduction numbers for both strains as well as the invasion reproduction
numbers are derived and used to examine the role of IPT on drug resistance.
Numerical simulations show the individual and combined effects of IPT and
treatment of symptomatic infections on the prevalence levels of both parasite
strains and on the number of lives saved. The results suggest that while IPT
can indeed save lives, particularly in the high transmission region, certain
combinations of drugs used for IPT and drugs used to treat symptomatic
infection may result in more deaths when resistant parasite strains are
circulating. Moreover, the half-lives of the treatment and IPT drugs used play
an important role in the extent to which IPT may influence the rate of spread
of the resistant strain. A sensitivity analysis indicates the model outcomes
are most sensitive to the reduction factor of transmission for the resistant
strain, rate of immunity loss, and the clearance rate of sensitive infections.

only fill in the gaps in those already published but also extend the time span
of the (O-C) diagram by three years. Based on the archival and our new data
spanning over more than 17 years we re-examined the up to date system (O-C).
The data revealed systematic, quasi-sinusoidal variation deviating from an
older linear ephemeris by about 100 s. It also exhibits a maximum in the (O-C)
near JD 2,456,400 that was previously unknown. We consider two most credible
explanations of the (O-C) variability: the light propagation time due to the
presence of an invisible companion in a distant circumbinary orbit, and
magnetic cycles reshaping one of the binary components, known as the Applegate
or Lanza-Rodono effect. We found that the latter mechanism is unlikely due to
the insufficient energy budget of the M-dwarf secondary. In the framework of
the third-body hypothesis, we obtained meaningful constraints on the Keplerian
parameters of a putative companion and its mass. Our best-fitting model
indicates that the observed quasi-periodic (O-C) variability can be explained
by the presence of a brown dwarf with the minimal mass of 15 Jupiter masses
rather than a planet, orbiting the binary in a moderately elliptical orbit (~
0.175) with the period of ~ 10 years. Our analysis rules out two planets model
proposed earlier.

advertisements (shortly ad) on websites are usually measured by how many times
they are viewed by online users. There are two major channels to sell ad views.
They can be auctioned off in real time or be directly sold through guaranteed
contracts in advance. The former is also known as real-time bidding (RTB), in
which media buyers come to a common marketplace to compete for a single ad view
and this inventory will be allocated to a buyer in milliseconds by an auction
model. Unlike RTB, buying and selling guaranteed contracts are not usually
programmatic but through private negotiations as advertisers would like to
customise their requests and purchase ad views in bulk. In this paper, we
propose a simple model that facilitates the automation of direct sales. In our
model, a media seller puts future ad views on sale and receives buy requests
sequentially over time until the future delivery period. The seller maintains a
hidden yet dynamically changing reserve price in order to decide whether to
accept a buy request or not. The future supply and demand are assumed to be
well estimated and static, and the model's revenue management is using
inventory control theory where each computed reverse price is based on the
updated supply and demand, and the unsold future ad views will be auctioned off
in RTB to the meet the unfulfilled demand. The model has several desirable
properties. First, it is not limited to the demand arrival assumption. Second,
it will not affect the current equilibrium between RTB and direct sales as
there are no posted guaranteed prices. Third, the model uses the expected
revenue from RTB as a lower bound for inventory control and we show that a
publisher can receive expected total revenue greater than or equal to those
from only RTB if she uses the computed dynamic reserves prices for direct
sales.

For many purposes, including agriculture and human life, temperature extremes

be more important than mean global changes. We define a nonparametric statistic
to describe extreme temperature behavior by quantifying the frequency of local
daily all-time highs and lows, normalized by their frequency in the null
hypothesis of no climate change. We average this metric over 1218 weather
stations in the 48 contiguous United States, and find significantly fewer
all-time lows than for the null hypothesis of unchanging climate. Record highs,
by contrast, exhibit no significant trend. The metric is evaluated by Monte

successful health-related behavior change. However, most of the existing
studies look at the effect that offline social feedback has. This paper fills
gaps in the literature by proposing a framework to study the causal effect that
receiving social support in the form of comments in an online weight loss
community has on (i) the probability of the user to return to the forum, and,
more importantly, on (ii) the weight loss reported by the user. Using a
matching approach for causal inference we observe a difference of 9 lbs lost
between users who do or do not receive comments. Surprisingly, this effect is
mediated by neither an increase in lifetime in the community nor by an
increased activity level of the user. Our results show the importance that a
""warm welcome"" has when using online support forums to achieve health outcomes.

its association with one of the vertices reconstructed by the CMS detectors.
The TOF detector is based on single crystal Chemical Vapor Deposition (scCVD)

given density and pressure of the medium, the spatial structure and energy
partition at a given time $t_{age}$ (since the onset of the outburst) are fully
determined by the total injected energy $E_{inj}$ and the duration $t_b$ of the
outburst. We are particularly interested in the late phase evolution when the
strong shock transforms into a sound wave. We studied the energy partition
during such transition with different combinations of $E_{inj}$ and $t_b$. For
an instantaneous outburst with $t_b\rightarrow 0$, which corresponds to the
extension of classic Sedov-Taylor solution with counter-pressure, the fraction
of energy that can be carried away by sound waves is $\lesssim$12% of
$E_{inj}$. As $t_b$ increases, the solution approaches the ""slow piston"" limit,
with the fraction of energy in sound waves approaching zero. We then repeat the
simulations using radial density and temperature profiles measured in Perseus
and M87/Virgo clusters. We find that the results with a uniform medium broadly
reproduce an outburst in more realistic conditions once proper scaling is
applied. We also develop techniques to map intrinsic properties of an outburst
$(E_{inj}, t_b$ and $t_{age})$ to the observables like the Mach number of the
shock and radii of the shock and ejecta. For the Perseus cluster and M87, the
estimated $(E_{inj}, t_b$ and $t_{age})$ agree with numerical simulations

information that was stored in the other drawers is lost. This property is
achieved by storing the information using a set of non-orthogonal quantum

interactions in a energy range beyond that probed by the LHC. One of the
uncertainties present in the modeling of the air showers is the treatment of
diffractive interactions, which are dominated by non - perturbative physics and
usually described by phenomenological models. These interactions are expect to
affect the development of the air showers, since they provide a way of
transporting substantial amounts of energy deep in the atmosphere, modifying
the global characteristics of the shower profile. In this paper we investigate
the impact of the diffractive interactions in the observables that can be
measured in hadronic collisions at high energies and ultra - high energy cosmic
ray interactions. We consider three distinct phenomenological models for the
treatment of diffractive physics and estimate the influence of these
interactions on the elasticity, number of secondaries, longitudinal air shower
profiles and muon densities for proton - air and iron - air collisions at
different primary energies. Our results demonstrate that the diffractive events
has a non - negligible effect on the observables and that the distinct

interfacial systems of arbitrarily large size. The idea consists in adopting a
cutoff-based method in which the cutoff is cho- sen on a particle-by-particle

challenge is shifted from the long-range solvers to the detection of the
interfaces and to the computation of the particle-interface distances. For
these tasks, we present linear-time algorithms that do not rely on global
communication patterns. As a result, the DCM algorithm is suited for large
systems of particles and mas- sively parallel computers. To demonstrate its
potential, we integrated DCM into the LAMMPS open-source molecular dynamics
package, and simulated large liquid/vapor systems on two supercomputers:
SuperMuc and JUQUEEN. In all cases, the accuracy of DCM is comparable to the
traditional particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) algorithm, while the
performance is considerably superior for large numbers of particles. For
JUQUEEN, we provide timings for simulations running on the full system (458,

Its proximity
allows high spatial resolution observations. We performed the first detailed
analysis of the emission-line properties in the nuclear region of NGC 1313,
using an optical data cube obtained with the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph.
We detected four main emitting areas, three of them (regions 1, 2 and 3) having
spectra typical of H II regions. Region 1 is located very close to the stellar
nucleus and shows broad spectral features characteristic of Wolf-Rayet stars.
Our analysis revealed the presence of one or two WC4-5 stars in this region,
which is compatible with results obtained by previous studies. Region 4 shows
spectral features (as a strong H$\alpha$ emission line, with a broad component)
typical of a massive emission-line star, such as a luminous blue variable, a
B[e] supergiant or a B hypergiant. The radial velocity map of the ionized gas
shows a pattern consistent with rotation. A significant drop in the values of
the gas velocity dispersion was detected very close to region 1, which suggests
that the young stars there were formed from this cold gas, possibly keeping low
values of velocity dispersion. Therefore, although detailed measurements of the
stellar kinematics were not possible (due to the weak stellar absorption
spectrum of this galaxy), we predict that NGC 1313 may also show a drop in the
values of the stellar velocity dispersion in its nuclear region.

human affect prediction. Our approach in addressing this problem is based on
the inferred activity of facial muscles over time, as captured by a depth
camera recording an individual's facial activity. Our contribution is two-fold:
First, we constructed a database of publicly available short video clips, which
elicit a strong emotional response in a consistent manner across different
individuals. Each video was tagged by its characteristic emotional response
along 4 scales: \emph{Valence, Arousal, Likability} and \emph{Rewatch} (the
desire to watch again). The second contribution is a two-step prediction
method, based on learning, which was trained and tested using this database of
tagged video clips. Our method was able to successfully predict the
aforementioned 4 dimensional representation of affect, as well as to identify
the period of strongest emotional response in the viewing recordings, in a
method that is blind to the video clip being watch, revealing a significantly
high agreement between the recordings of independent viewers.

protocluster galaxies are significantly affected by their environment as
galaxies are in local clusters. Through a deep, 64 hours of effective on-source
integration with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we discovered a
massive, M_mol=2.0+-0.2x10^11 M_sun, extended, ~40 kpc, CO(1-0)-emitting disk
in the protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy, MRC1138-262. The galaxy, at
z_CO=2.1478, is a clumpy, massive disk galaxy, M_star~5x10^11 M_sun, which lies
250 kpc in projection from MRC1138-262 and is a known H-alpha emitter, HAE229.
HAE229 has a molecular gas fraction of ~30%. The CO emission has a kinematic
gradient along its major axis, centered on the highest surface brightness
rest-frame optical emission, consistent with HAE229 being a rotating disk.
Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the CO emission lies outside of the
UV/optical emission. In spite of this, HAE229 follows the same relation between
star-formation rate and molecular gas mass as normal field galaxies. HAE229 is
the first CO(1-0) detection of an ordinary, star-forming galaxy in a
protocluster. We compare a sample of cluster members at z>0.4 that are detected
in low-order CO transitions with a similar sample of sources drawn from the
field. We confirm findings that the CO-luminosity and FWHM are correlated in
starbursts and show that this relation is valid for normal high-z galaxies as
well as those in overdensities. We do not find a clear dichotomy in the
integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for protocluster and field galaxies. Not
finding any environmental dependence in the ""star-formation efficiency"" or the
molecular gas content, especially for such an extended CO disk, suggests that
environmentally-specific processes such as ram pressure stripping are not
operating efficiently in (proto)clusters. (abridged)

was defined and solved for first-order sequent calculus by Gentzen in his
celebrated Hauptsatz. Ceres is a different cut-elimination algorithm for first-
and higher-order classical logic. Ceres was extended to proof schemata, which
are templates for usual first-order proofs, with parameters for natural
numbers. However, while Ceres is known to be a complete cut-elimination
algorithm for first-order logic, it is not clear whether this holds for
first-order schemata too: given in input a proof schema with cuts, does Ceres
always produce a schema for a cut-free proof? The difficult step is finding and
representing an appropriate refutation schema for the characteristic term
schema of a proof schema. In this thesis, we progress in solving this problem
by restricting Ceres to propositional schemata, which are templates for
propositional proofs. By limiting adequately the expressivity of propositional
schemata and proof schemata, we aim at providing a version of schematic Ceres
which is a complete cut-elimination algorithm for propositional schemata. We
focus on one particular step of Ceres: resolution refutation schemata. First,
we prove that by naively adapting Ceres for first-order schemata to our case,
we end up with an incomplete algorithm. Then, we modify slightly the concept of
resolution refutation schema: to refute a clause set, first we bring it to a
generic form, and then we use a fixed refutation of that generic clause set.
Our variation of schematic Ceres is the first step towards completeness with
respect to propositional schemata.

likely powerful enough to account for the brief gamma-ray flashes. Neutrino
annihilation can also explain the ""extended"" emission lasting $\sim 100$ s in

On the one hand, for every $p\neq2$ we construct explicit global
$2$-homogeneous solutions to the $p$-Laplacian obstacle problem whose free
boundaries have a corner at the origin. In particular, we show that the free
boundary is in general not $C^1$ at points where $\nabla \varphi=0$. On the
other hand, under the ""concavity"" assumption $|\nabla \varphi|^{2-p}\Delta_p
\varphi<0$, we show the free boundary is countably $(n-1)$-rectifiable and we
prove a nondegeneracy property for $u$ at all free boundary points.

universally accompanied by initial state QCD radiation that is predominantly
soft with respect to the hard process scale $Q$ and/or collinear with respect
to the beam axis. At TeV-scale colliders, this is in contrast to top quark and
multijet processes, which, by definition, are hard and central. Consequently,
vetoing events with jets possessing transverse momenta above $p_T^{\rm Veto}$
in searches for new color-singlet states can efficiently reduce non-singlet
backgrounds, thereby increasing experimental sensitivity. To quantify this
generic observation, we investigate the production and leptonic decay of a
Sequential Standard Model $W'$ boson at the 13 TeV LHC. We systematically
consider signal and background processes at next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD
with parton shower (PS) matching; for color-singlet channels, we resum Sudakov
logarithms of the form $\alpha_s^j(p_T^{\rm Veto})\log^k(Q/p_T^{\rm Veto})$ up
to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL) with NLO matching. We
obtain our results using the MadGraph5aMC@NLO and MadGraph5aMC@NLO-SCET
frameworks, respectively. Associated FeynRules model files capable of handling
NLO+PS- and NLO+NNLL-accurate computations are publicly available. We find that
within their given uncertainties, both the NLO+PS and NLO+NNLL(veto)
calculations give accurate and consistent predictions. Consequently, jet vetoes
applied to color-singlet processes can be reliably modeled at the NLO+PS level.
With respect to a $b$-jet veto of $p_{T}^{\rm Veto} = 30$ GeV, flavor-agnostic
vetoes of $p_{T}^{\rm Veto} = 30-40$ GeV can further reduce single top and
$t\overline{t}$ rates by a factor of 2-50 at a mild cost of the signal rate.
Jet vetoes can increase signal-to-noise ratios by roughly 10\% for light $W'$
boson masses of 30-50 GeV and 25\%-250\% for masses of 300-800 GeV.

a computation process that unavoidably involves energy dissipation. If done
reversibly, such an erasure generates the minimal heat of $k_BT\ln 2$ per
erased bit of information. The goal of this work is to discuss the actual
reversal of the optimal erasure which can serve as the basis for the Maxwell's
demon operating with ultimate thermodynamic efficiency as dictated by the
second law of thermodynamics. The demon extracts $k_BT\ln 2$ of heat from an
equilibrium reservoir at temperature $T$ per one bit of information obtained
about the measured system used by the demon. We have analyzed this Maxwell's
demon in the situation when it uses a general quantum system with a discrete
spectrum of energy levels as its working body. In the case of the effectively
two-level system, which has been realized experimentally based on tunneling of
individual electron in a single-electron box [J.V. Koski et al., PNAS 111,
13786 (2014)], we also studied and minimized corrections to the ideal
reversible operation of the demon. These corrections include, in particular,
the non-adiabatic terms which are described by a version of the classical
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The overall reversibility of the Maxwell's
demon requires, beside the reversibility of the intrinsic working body
dynamics, the reversibility of the measurement and feedback processes. The
single-electron demon can, in principle, be made fully reversible by developing
a thermodynamically reversible single-electron charge detector for measurements
of the individual charge states of the single-electron box.

a constant which is related to Milgrom's constant. The two primary relations

the p-wave Majorana wire model. In particular we examine whether zero-mode
operators analogous to Majorana zero-modes can be found in these models when
one introduces chiral parameters to break time reversal symmetry. The existence
of such zero-modes implies $N$-fold degeneracies throughout the energy
spectrum. We address the question directly through these degeneracies by
characterising the entire energy spectrum using perturbation theory and exact
diagonalisation. We find that when $N$ is prime, and the length $L$ of the wire
is finite, the spectrum exhibits degeneracies up to a splitting that decays
exponentially with system size, for generic values of the chiral parameters.
However, at particular parameter values (resonance points), band crossings
appear in the unperturbed spectrum that typically result in a splitting of the
degeneracy at finite order. We find strong evidence that these preclude the
existence of strong zero-modes for generic values of the chiral parameters. In
particular we show that in the thermodynamic limit, the resonance points become
dense in the chiral parameter space. When $N$ is not prime, the situation is
qualitatively different, and degeneracies in the energy spectrum are split at
finite order in perturbation theory for generic parameter values, even when the
length of the wire $L$ is finite. Exceptions to these general findings can
occur at special ""anti-resonant"" points. Here the evidence points to the
existence of strong zero modes and, in the case of the achiral point of the the
$N=4$ model, we are able to construct these modes exactly.

Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) treating a metasurface as a
spatial discontinuity. The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian
electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, $\chi_\text{ee}$ and
$\chi_\text{mm}$, respectively, and its resonant frequencies are periodically
modulated in both space and time. The unknown scattered fields are then
expressed in terms of Floquet modes, which when used with the GSTCs, lead to a
system of field matrix equations. The resulting set of linear equations are
then solved numerically to determine the total scattered fields. Using a
finite-difference time domain (FDTD) solver, the proposed method is validated
and confirmed for several examples of modulation depths ($\Delta_p$) and
frequencies ($\omega_p$). Finally, the computed steady-state scattered fields
are Fourier propagated analytically, for visualization of refracted harmonics.
The proposed method is simple and versatile and able to determine the
steady-state response of a space-time modulated Huygen's metasurface, for
arbitrary modulation frequencies and depths.

the second is the boost operator. The latter for known cases coincides with the

possibility of generating periodically oscillating states with the period

Our simulation leads to a pest spreading pattern comparable to the real data

different climate conditions based on two different representative
concentration pathways scenarios for the future. We observe that after an
initial stage of a slow spread of pests, a sudden change in the spreading speed
occurs, which is soon followed by a large-scale outbreak. We found that a
future climate change causes the outbreak point to occur earlier and that the

Teff ~ 6100 K which we designate as ""B-N"" (blue northerly image). The host of
the quadruple system, however, is a Kp = 17 magnitude star with a composite
M-star spectrum, which we designate as ""R-S"" (red southerly image). With a 3.2""
separation and similar radial velocities and photometric distances, 'B-N' is
likely physically associated with 'R-S', making this a quintuple system, but
that is incidental to our main claim of a strongly interacting quadruple system
in 'R-S'. The two binaries in 'R-S' have orbital periods of 13.27 d and 14.41
d, respectively, and each has an inclination angle of >89 degrees. From our
analysis of radial velocity measurements, and of the photometric lightcurve, we
conclude that all four stars are very similar with masses close to 0.4 Msun.
Both of the binaries exhibit significant ETVs where those of the primary and
secondary eclipses 'diverge' by 0.05 days over the course of the 80-day
observations. Via a systematic set of numerical simulations of quadruple
systems consisting of two interacting binaries, we conclude that the outer
orbital period is very likely to be between 300 and 500 days. If sufficient
time is devoted to RV studies of this faint target, the outer orbit should be
measurable within a year.

a dusty dark dwarf galaxy, which has not been detected in either the optical,

we find that the dark matter plus baryon mass associated with the object is

search and similarity estimation in high-dimensional spaces. The basic idea is
that similar objects should produce hash collisions with probability
significantly larger than objects with low similarity. We consider LSH for
objects that can be represented as point sets in either one or two dimensions.
To make the point sets finite size we consider the subset of points on a grid.
Directly applying LSH (e.g. min-wise hashing) to these point sets would require
time proportional to the number of points. We seek to achieve time that is much
lower than direct approaches.
  Technically, we introduce new primitives for range-efficient consistent
sampling (of independent interest), and show how to turn such samples into LSH
values. Another application of our technique is a data structure for quickly
estimating the size of the intersection or union of a set of preprocessed
polygons. Curiously, our consistent sampling method uses transformation to a
geometric problem.

that there is definitively 3rd-light contamination (66%) in the CSS photometry.
The secondary star seems inflated, probably due to tidal locking of the close

Future spectroscopic observations with high resolution will narrow down the

as a benchmark in studying fundamental properties of M dwarfs.

which are computationally expensive. To overcome this problem, we propose a
non-iterative framework to reduce computational requirement. First, the
attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and axonometric projection are

Fourier transformation, which provides a closed-form non-iterative solution. In
this manner, the time complexity is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(n \log{n})$, where
$n$ is the number of matched points in each frame. To the best of our

for data association in visual SLAM. Compared with the state-of-the-arts, it
runs at a faster speed and obtains 3-D maps with higher resolution yet still

reranking schemes are studied and compared with different ontology-based
expansion methods in web document search and retrieval. In particular, we focus
on concept-based query expansion schemes, where, in order to effectively
increase the precision of web document retrieval and to decrease the users
browsing time, the main goal is to quickly provide users with the most suitable
query expansion. Two key tasks for query expansion in web document retrieval
are to find the expansion candidates, as the closest concepts in web document
domain, and to rank the expanded queries properly. The approach we propose aims
at improving the expansion phase for better web document retrieval and
precision. The basic idea is to measure the distance between candidate concepts
using the PMING distance, a collaborative semantic proximity measure, i.e. a
measure which can be computed by using statistical results from web search
engine. Experiments show that the proposed technique can provide users with
more satisfying expansion results and improve the quality of web document
retrieval.

SPH requires that the density is continuous and differentiable. The second one
is that SPH does not have the consistency, and thus the accuracy is zeroth
order in space. In addition, we cannot express accurate boundary conditions
with SPH. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-order scheme for
particle-based hydrodynamics of compress- ible fluid. Our method is based on
kernel-weighted high-order fitting polynomial for intensive variables. With
this approach, we can construct a scheme which solves all of the three prob-

von-Neumann-Richtmyer artificial viscosity. We have applied our method to many
test problems and obtained excel- lent result. Our method is not conservative,
since particles do not have mass or energy, but only their densities. However,
because of the Lagrangian nature of our scheme, the violation of the
conservation laws turned out to be small. We name this method Consistent

first introduce the concept of stationary $k$-Bratteli diagrams, to associate a
family of ultrametric Cantor sets to a finite, strongly connected higher-rank
graph $\Lambda$. Then we show that under mild hypotheses, the
Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples of such Cantor sets have a regular
$\zeta$-function, whose abscissa of convergence agrees with the Hausdorff
dimension of the Cantor set, and that the measure $\mu$ induced by the
associated Dixmier trace agrees with the measure $M$ on the infinite path space
$\Lambda^\infty$ of $\Lambda$ which was introduced by an Huef, Laca, Raeburn,
and Sims. Furthermore, we prove that $\mu = M$ is a rescaled version of the
Hausdorff measure of the ultrametric Cantor set. From work of Julien and
Savinien, we know that for $\zeta$-regular Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples,
the eigenspaces of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operator constitute an
orthogonal decomposition of $L^2(\Lambda^\infty, \mu)$; we show that this
orthogonal decomposition refines the wavelet decomposition of Farsi et al. In

substitutions, which induces a property known as intuitionistic hereditary.
Intuitionistic hereditary reflects in logic the lazy instantiation of free

  Bounds","Fixed typos and other small errors; added references to follow-up

circuits. Just as with the natural proofs notion of Razborov and Rudich for
boolean circuit lower bounds, our notion of algebraically natural lower bounds
captures nearly all lower bound techniques known. However, unlike the boolean
setting, there has been no concrete evidence demonstrating that this is a
barrier to obtaining super-polynomial lower bounds for general algebraic
circuits, as there is little understanding whether algebraic circuits are
expressive enough to support ""cryptography"" secure against algebraic circuits.
  Following a similar result of Williams in the boolean setting, we show that
the existence of an algebraic natural proofs barrier is equivalent to the
existence of succinct derandomization of the polynomial identity testing
problem. That is, whether the coefficient vectors of polylog(N)-degree
polylog(N)-size circuits is a hitting set for the class of poly(N)-degree
poly(N)-size circuits. Further, we give an explicit universal construction
showing that if such a succinct hitting set exists, then our universal
construction suffices.
  Further, we assess the existing literature constructing hitting sets for
restricted classes of algebraic circuits and observe that none of them are
succinct as given. Yet, we show how to modify some of these constructions to
obtain succinct hitting sets. This constitutes the first evidence supporting
the existence of an algebraic natural proofs barrier.
  Our framework is similar to the Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT) program of
Mulmuley and Sohoni, except that here we emphasize constructiveness of the
proofs while the GCT program emphasizes symmetry. Nevertheless, our succinct
hitting sets have relevance to the GCT program as they imply lower bounds for
the complexity of the defining equations of polynomials computed by small
circuits.

quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these
existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating
scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.).
These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information,
whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and
transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However,
it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to
process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the
needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing
the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment
analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract
blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate
results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment
analysis and SWRL rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation
activities and to make a city- feature polarity map for travelers. This system
retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation
activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and
then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature
polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by
using Prot\'eg\'e OWL and Java, respectively.

adsorption energies, and some experiments have shown promising results. We
investigate the upper bounds of hydrogen storage capacities of $C_{60}Cs$
clusters grown in ultracold helium nanodroplets by analyzing anomalies in the
ion abundance that indicate shell closure of hydrogen adsorption shells. On
bare $C_{60}^{+}$, a commensurate phase with 32 $H_2$ molecules was identified
in previous experiments. Doping $C_{60}$ with a single cesium atom leads to an
increase in relative ion abundance for the first 10 $H_2$ molecules, and the
closure of the commensurate phase is shifted from 32 to 42 $H_2$ molecules.
Density functional theory calculations indicate that thirteen energetically
enhanced adsorption sites exist, where six of them fill the groove between Cs

effect of the quantum nature of the hydrogen molecule on the adsorption
energies, i.e. the adsorption energies are decreased by around 50% for
$(H_2)C_{60}Cs$ and up to 80% for $(H_2)C_{60}$ by harmonic zero-point
corrections, which represent an upper bound to corrections for dissociation
energies ($D_e$ to $D_0$) by the vibrational ground states. Five normal modes
of libration and vibration of $H_2$ physisorbed on the substrate contribute
primarily to this large decrease in adsorption energies. A similar effect can
be found for H2 physisorbed on benzene and is expected to be found for any

total mass profile is well fitted by a Navarro, Frenk & White model, with

that the Komatsu & Seljak hydrostatic solution provides a good fit to the gas

radius, and correlates with the halo formation time. Using only three main

one-loop level, and in order to describe leptonic mixing, both the Standard
Model and the extra Higgs scalar doublets need to couple to leptons (in a
type-III two-Higgs doublet model), which necessarily generates large lepton
flavor violating signals, also in Higgs decays. Imposing all relevant
phenomenological constraints and performing a full numerical scan of the
parameter space, we find that both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings
can be fitted, although the latter is disfavored with respect to the former. In
fact, inverted ordering can only be accommodated if $\theta_{23}$ turns out to
be in the first octant. A branching ratio for $h \to \tau \mu$ of up to
$10^{-2}$ is allowed, but it could be as low as $10^{-6}$. In addition, if
future expected sensitivities of $\tau\to \mu\gamma$ are achieved, normal
ordering can be almost completely tested. Also, $\mu e$ conversion is expected
to probe large parts of the parameter space, excluding completely inverted
ordering if no signal is observed. Furthermore, non-standard neutrino
interactions are found to be smaller than $10^{-6}$, which is well below future
experimental sensitivity. Finally, the results of our scan indicate that the

towards some final ('relaxed') state occurs, then the necessary condition for
the stability of the relaxed state against slowly evolving perturbations is the
same for all the systems of this class, regardless of both detailed dynamics of
the system, amplitude of fluctuations around mean values and possible
occurrence of periodic oscillations in the relaxed state. Our discussion
invokes no Onsager symmetry, no detailed model of heat transport and
production, and no approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium. This
necessary condition of stability is the constrained minimization of time- and
path-ensemble-averaged amount of entropy produced per unit time inside the bulk
of the system; for each system, constraints are provided by the equations of
motion. (Thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to identically vanishing amount
of entropy produced in the bulk, and satisfies trivially this condition). Our

Hasselmann kinetic integral and involving various modifications of known
parametrizations for the wave-pumping mechanism due to wind and the
wave-dissipation mechanism due viscosity of the upper layer. It is shown that
the balance of the last two mechanisms is responsible for a formation of
stationary part of the wind-wave spectrum. This balance allows establishing any
prescribed form of the equilibrium part of the spectrum, if the proper
representations of input and dissipation mechanisms are chosen.

networks, there has been a lot of work on community-search and team-formation
problems. In the former class of problems, the goal is to find a subgraph that
satisfies a certain connectivity requirement and contains a given collection of
seed nodes. In the latter class of problems, on the other hand, the goal is to
find individuals who collectively have the skills required for a task and form
a connected subgraph with certain properties.
  In this paper, we extend both the community-search and the team-formation
problems by associating each individual with a profile. The profile is a
numeric score that quantifies the position of an individual with respect to a
topic. We adopt a model where each individual starts with a latent profile and
arrives to a conformed profile through a dynamic conformation process, which
takes into account the individual's social interaction and the tendency to
conform with one's social environment. In this framework, social tension arises
from the differences between the conformed profiles of neighboring individuals
as well as from differences between individuals' conformed and latent profiles.
  Given a network of individuals, their latent profiles and this conformation
process, we extend the community-search and the team-formation problems by
requiring the output subgraphs to have low social tension. From the technical
point of view, we study the complexity of these problems and propose algorithms
for solving them effectively. Our experimental evaluation in a number of social
networks reveals the efficacy and efficiency of our methods.

been considered as an ideal realization of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL).
However, it remains unclear whether one-dimensional correlated states are
realized under local environmental effects such as the formation of a bundle
structure. Intertube effects originating from other adjacent SWCNTs within a
bundle may drastically alter the one-dimensional correlated state. In order to
test the validity of the TLL model in bundled SWCNTs, low-energy spin
excitation is investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR
relaxation rate in bundled mixtures of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs shows
a power-law temperature dependence with a theoretically predicted exponent.
This demonstrates that a TLL state with the same strength as that for effective
Coulomb interactions is realized in a bundled sample, as in isolated SWCNTs. In
bundled metallic SWCNTs, we found a power-law temperature dependence of the
relaxation rate, but the magnitude of the relaxation rate is one order of
magnitude smaller than that predicted by theory. Furthermore, we found an
almost doubled magnitude of the Luttinger parameter. These results indicate
suppressed spin excitations with reduced Coulomb interactions in bundled
metallic SWCNTs, which are attributable to intertube interactions originating
from adjacent metallic SWCNTs within a bundle. Our findings give direct
evidence that bundling reduces the effective Coulomb interactions via intertube
interactions within bundled metallic SWCNTs.

quantum system is a powerful tool for unravelling its critical nature. For
instance, the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy determines the
central charge of the associated Virasoro algebra. For a free fermion system,
the entanglement entropy depends essentially on two sets, namely the set $A$ of
sites of the subsystem considered and the set $K$ of excited momentum modes. In
this work we make use of a general duality principle establishing the
invariance of the entanglement entropy under exchange of the sets $A$ and $K$
to tackle complex problems by studying their dual counterparts. The duality
principle is also a key ingredient in the formulation of a novel conjecture for
the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy of a free fermion system in
the general case in which both sets $A$ and $K$ consist of an arbitrary number
of blocks. We have verified that this conjecture reproduces the numerical
results with excellent precision for all the configurations analyzed. We have
also applied the conjecture to deduce several asymptotic formulas for the
mutual and $r$-partite information generalizing the known ones for the single
block case.

facial datasets have been collected containing both neutral as well as
expressive faces. However, all datasets are captured under controlled

from such data, it is difficult to build statistical texture models that are
sufficient to reconstruct faces captured in unconstrained conditions
(""in-the-wild""). In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our
knowledge, ""in-the-wild"" 3DMM by combining a powerful statistical model of

there is no need to optimize with regards to the illumination parameters.

state-of-the-art performance. Complementary qualitative reconstruction results
are demonstrated on standard ""in-the-wild"" facial databases. An open source

for galaxy-galaxy interactions, though an alternative hypothesis is that these
are primordial 'dark galaxies' which have not formed stars. Similarly, certain
kinematic features in HI streams are also controversial, sometimes taken as
evidence of dark galaxies but also perhaps explicable as the result of
harassment. We numerically model the passage of a galaxy through the
gravitational field of cluster. The galaxy consists of SPH particles for the
gas and n-bodies for the stars and dark matter, while the cluster includes the
gravitational effects of substructure using 400 subhalos (the effects of the
intracluster medium are ignored). We find that harassment can indeed produce
long HI streams and these streams can include kinematic features resembling
dark galaxy candidates such as VIRGOHI21. We also show that apparent clouds
with diameter < 20 kpc and velocity widths < 50 km/s are almost invariably
produced in these simulations, making tidal debris a highly probable
explanation. In contrast, we show that the frequency of isolated clouds of the
same size but velocity width > 100 km/s is negligible - making this a very
unlikely explanation for the observed clouds in the Virgo cluster with these
properties.

close binary called Plaskett's star shows a variety of unusual properties.
Since strong binary interactions are believed to have occurred in this system,
one may wonder about their potential role in generating magnetic fields. Stokes
V spectra collected with the low-resolution FORS2 and high-resolution ESPaDOnS
and Narval spectropolarimeters were therefore used to search for magnetic
fields in 15 interacting or post-interaction massive binaries. No magnetic
field was detected in any of them, with 0G always being within 2sigma of the
derived values. For 17 out of 25 stars in the systems observed at
high-resolution, the 90% upper limit on the individual dipolar fields is below
the dipolar field strength of Plaskett's secondary; a similar result is found
for five out of six systems observed at low resolution. If our sample is
considered to form a group of stars sharing similar magnetic properties, a
global statistical analysis results in a stringent upper limit of ~200G on the
dipolar field strength. Moreover, the magnetic incidence rate in the full
sample of interacting or post-interaction systems (our targets + Plaskett's
star) is compatible with that measured from large surveys, showing that they
are not significantly different from the general O-star population. These
results suggest that binary interactions play no systematic role in the
magnetism of such massive systems.

curvature flow which unifies and improves all previously known pinching
estimates, including the umbilic estimate of Huisken, the convexity estimates
of Huisken--Sinestrari and the cylindrical estimate of Huisken--Sinestrari.
Namely, we show that the curvature of the solution pinches onto the convex cone
generated by the curvatures of any shrinking cylinder solutions admitted by the
initial data. For example, if the initial data is $(m+1)$-convex, then the
curvature of the solution pinches onto the convex hull of the curvatures of the
shrinking cylinders $\mathbb{R}^m\times S^{n-m}_{\sqrt{2(n-m)(1-t)}}$, $t<1$.
In particular, this yields a sharp estimate for the largest principal
curvature, which we use to obtain a new proof of a sharp estimate for the
inscribed curvature for embedded solutions. Making use of a recent idea of
Huisken--Sinestrari, we then obtain a series of sharp estimates for ancient
solutions. In particular, we obtain a convexity estimate for ancient solutions
which allows us to improve recent characterizations of the shrinking sphere due
to Huisken--Sinestrari and Haslhofer--Hershkovitz.

the exact spectrum and occurrences of OCR errors in an OCR'ed text. Yet, for
interactive postcorrection of OCR'ed historical printings it is extremely
useful to have a statistical profile available that provides an estimate of
error classes with associated frequencies, and that points to conjectured
errors and suspicious tokens. The method introduced in Reffle (2013) computes
such a profile, combining lexica, pattern sets and advanced matching techniques
in a specialized Expectation Maximization (EM) procedure. Here we improve this
method in three respects: First, the method in Reffle (2013) is not adaptive:
user feedback obtained by actual postcorrection steps cannot be used to compute
refined profiles. We introduce a variant of the method that is open for
adaptivity, taking correction steps of the user into account. This leads to
higher precision with respect to recognition of erroneous OCR tokens. Second,
during postcorrection often new historical patterns are found. We show that
adding new historical patterns to the linguistic background resources leads to
a second kind of improvement, enabling even higher precision by telling
historical spellings apart from OCR errors. Third, the method in Reffle (2013)
does not make any active use of tokens that cannot be interpreted in the
underlying channel model. We show that adding these uninterpretable tokens to
the set of conjectured errors leads to a significant improvement of the recall

of the propagules, a second question of major interest is the invasive power.
How far can such an invading front go, and what can stop it? We rigorously show
that a heterogeneous environment inducing a strong enough population gradient
can stop an invading front, which will converge in this case to a stable front.
We characterize the critical population jump, and also prove the existence of
unstable fronts above the stable (blocking) fronts. Being above the maximal
unstable front enables an invading front to clear the obstacle and propagate
further. We are particularly interested in the case of artificial Wolbachia
infection, used as a tool to fight arboviruses.

  While cons-free programs have previously been used by several authors to
characterise complexity classes, the work on non-deterministic programs has
almost exclusively considered programs of data order 0. Previous work has shown
that adding explicit non-determinism to cons-free programs taking data of order
0 does not increase expressivity; we prove that this - dramatically - is not
the case for higher data orders: adding non-determinism to programs with data
order at least 1 allows for a characterisation of the entire class of
elementary-time decidable sets.

that obtained by carrying out mock observations in the N-body simulations, and
show that the estimator typically used for the local Hubble constant in studies

N-body simulations. The latter gives larger weight to distant sources, which
explains why studies based on N-body simulations tend to obtain a smaller
variance than that found from studies based on the power spectrum. Although
both approaches result in a variance too small to explain the discrepancy
between the value of $H_0$ from CMB measurements and the value measured in the

fluid rather than the conventional vapor compression is a promising alternative
to exploit waste thermal energy for heat reallocation. In this context, there
is an increasing interest to find novel porous solids able to adsorb a high
energy density of working fluid under low relative vapor pressure condition
combined with an easy ability of regeneration (desorption) at low temperature,
which are the major requirements for adsorption driven heat pumps and chillers.
The porous crystalline hybrid materials named Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF)
represent a great source of inspiration for sorption based-applications owing
to their tunable chemical and topological features associated with a large
variability of pore sizes. Recently, we have designed a new MOF (named
MIL-160), isostructural do CAU-10, built from the assembly of corner sharing
aluminum chains octahedra AlO4(OH)2 with the 2,5-furandicarboxylic linker
substituting the pristine organic linker, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate. This ligand
replacement strategy proved to enhance both the hydrophilicity of the MOF and
its amount of water adsorbed at low p-p0. This designed solid was synthesized
and its chemical stability/adsorption performances verified. Here, we have
extended this study by incorporating other polar heterocyclic linkers and a
comparative computational study of the water adsorption performances of these
novel structures has been performed. To that purpose, the cell and geometry
optimizations of all hypothetical frameworks were first performed at the
density functional theory level and their water adsorption isotherms were
further predicted by using force-field based Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo
simulations. This study reveals the ease tunable water affinity of MOF for the
desired application.

uncertain networks given a constrained budget of edges. We show that this
problem requires to solve two NP-hard subproblems: the computation of expected
information flow, and the optimal choice of edges. To compute the expected
information flow to a source vertex, we propose the F-tree as a specialized
data structure, that identifies independent components of the graph for which
the information flow can either be computed analytically and efficiently, or
for which traditional Monte-Carlo sampling can be applied independently of the
remaining network. For the problem of finding the optimal edges, we propose a
series of heuristics that exploit properties of this data structure. Our
evaluation shows that these heuristics lead to high quality solutions, thus
yielding high information flow, while maintaining low running time.

Domains such as finance and computer games increasingly mandate that developers
be able to encode complex application logic and control transaction latencies
in in-memory databases. At the same time, infrastructure engineers in these
domains need to experiment with and deploy OLTP database architectures that
ensure application scalability and maximize resource utilization in modern
machines. In this paper, we propose a relational actor programming model for
in-memory databases as a novel, holistic approach towards fulfilling these
challenging requirements. Conceptually, relational actors, or reactors for
short, are application-defined, isolated logical actors that encapsulate
relations and process function calls asynchronously. Reactors ease reasoning
about correctness by guaranteeing serializability of application-level function
calls. In contrast to classic transactional models, however, reactors allow
developers to take advantage of intra-transaction parallelism and state
encapsulation in their applications to reduce latency and improve locality.
Moreover, reactors enable a new degree of flexibility in database deployment.
We present ReactDB, a system design exposing reactors that allows for flexible
virtualization of database architecture between the extremes of shared-nothing
and shared-everything without changes to application code. Our experiments
illustrate latency control, low overhead, and asynchronicity trade-offs with
ReactDB in OLTP benchmarks.

through low-temperature pressure-induced amorphization of the 'ordinary' ice I,
is heavily debated. Clarifying this question is not only important for
understanding the complex condensed states of H$_2$O but also in the wider
context of pressure-induced amorphization processes, which are encountered
across the entire materials spectrum. We first show that ammonium fluoride
(NH$_4$F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes
a pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is
not amorphous but NH$_4$F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV.
This collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In
the case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a
deviation from this mechanism and we therefore classify HDA as a 'derailed'
state along the ice I to ice IV pathway.

extensive numerical simulations and validate it by re-analyzing PTEN's

crosstalk and provide new keys to analyze transcriptional datasets and

are entirely disconnected from the complex, the resulting variations in the
excitation transfer rates through the complex can be monitored through the
corresponding changes in the scattering spectra of the incident nanowire
surface plasmons. We also find that these changes can be further enhanced by
changing the ratio of plasmon-site couplings. The change of the Fano lineshape
in the scattering spectra further reveals that ""site 5"" in the FMO complex
plays a distinct role from other sites. Our results provide a feasible way,
using single photons, to detect mutation-induced, or bleaching-induced, local

understanding of many fields of astrophysics, including stellar evolution and
the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium via stellar yields. One the
main unsolved questions is the geometry of the mass-loss process. Taking
advantage of the results from the Herschel Mass loss of Evolved StarS (MESS)
programme, we initiated a coordinated effort to characterise the geometry of
mass loss from evolved red giants at various spatial scales. For this purpose
we used the MID-infrared interferometric Instrument (MIDI) to resolve the inner
envelope of 14 asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) in the MESS sample. In this
contribution we present an overview of the interferometric data collected
within the frame of our Large Programme, and we also add archive data for
completeness. We studied the geometry of the inner atmosphere by comparing the
observations with predictions from different geometric models. Asymmetries are
detected for five O-rich and S-type, suggesting that asymmetries in the N band
are more common among stars with such chemistry. We speculate that this fact is
related to the characteristics of the dust grains. Except for one star, no
interferometric variability is detected, i.e. the changes in size of the shells
of non-mira stars correspond to changes of the visibility of less than 10%. The
observed spectral variability confirms previous findings from the literature.
The detection of dust in our sample follows the location of the AGBs in the
IRAS colour-colour diagram: more dust is detected around oxygen-rich stars in
region II and in the carbon stars in region VII. The SiC dust feature does not
appear in the visibility spectrum of UAnt and SSct, which are two carbon stars
with detached shells. This finding has implications for the theory of SiC dust
formation.

($\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$)~\cite{Huang13ICIP} suffers from low capture rates,
resulting in low resolution images when acquired over a short time. In this
work, we propose a new regime to mitigate these drawbacks. We replace the
global-based compressive sensing used in the existing $\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$ by
the local block (patch) based compressive sensing. We use a single sensor for
each block, rather than for the entire image, thus forming a multiple but
spatially parallel sensor $\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$. This new camera retains the
advantages of existing $\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$ while leading to the following
additional benefits: 1) Since each block can be very small, {\em e.g.}$~8\times
8$ pixels, we only need to capture $\sim 10$ measurements to achieve reasonable
reconstruction. Therefore the capture time can be reduced significantly. 2) The
coding patterns used in each block can be the same, therefore the sensing
matrix is only of the block size compared to the entire image size in existing
$\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$. This saves the memory requirement of the sensing matrix
as well as speeds up the reconstruction. 3) Patch based image reconstruction is
fast and since real time stitching algorithms exist, we can perform real time
reconstruction. 4) These small blocks can be integrated to any desirable
number, leading to ultra high resolution images while retaining fast capture
rate and fast reconstruction. We develop multiple geometries of this block-wise
$\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$ in this paper. We have built prototypes of the proposed
block-wise $\text{L}^2\text{C}^2$ and demonstrated excellent results of real

$\mu m$ thick GEM is only several times ten. On the other hand, a thick GEM
whose amplification area is expanded from 50 to 100 $\mu m$ to get higher gas
gain which can be sufficient even with a double stack configuration. But the
measurement of gas gain uniformity using a large area 100 $\mu m$ thick GEM
reported here observed sizable non-uniformity which reached more than 50\%. We
investigated gas gain uniformity which is derived from geometries of the GEM
using $\rm{garfield^{++}}$ and considered an optimal geometry for the 100 $\mu

associated with the expression of a gene. Most existing eQTL analyses and
methods investigate association in a single, readily available tissue, such as
blood. Joint analysis of eQTL in multiple tissues has the potential to improve,
and expand the scope of, single-tissue analyses. Large-scale collaborative
efforts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program are currently
generating high quality data in a large number of tissues. However,
computational constraints limit genome-wide multi-tissue eQTL analysis. We
develop an integrative method under a hierarchical Bayesian framework for eQTL
analysis in a large number of tissues. The model fitting procedure is highly
scalable, and the computing time is a polynomial function of the number of
tissues. Multi-tissue eQTLs are identified through a local false discovery rate
approach, which rigorously controls the false discovery rate. Using simulation
and GTEx real data studies, we show that the proposed method has superior
performance to existing methods in terms of computing time and the power of
eQTL discovery. We provide a scalable method for eQTL analysis in a large

been used as a powerful tool for analyzing rhythmic phenomena. Recently, the
notion of isostables, which complements the isochrons by characterizing
amplitudes of the system state, i.e., deviations from the limit-cycle
attractor, has been introduced to describe transient dynamics around the limit
cycle [Wilson and Moehlis, Phys. Rev. E 94, 052213 (2016)]. In this study, we
introduce a framework for a reduced phase-amplitude description of transient
dynamics of stable limit-cycling systems. In contrast to the preceding study,
the isostables are treated in a fully consistent way with the Koopman operator
analysis, which enables us to avoid discontinuities of the isostables and to
apply the framework to system states far from the limit cycle. We also propose
a new, convenient bi-orthogonalization method to obtain the response functions
of the amplitudes, which can be interpreted as an extension of the adjoint
covariant Lyapunov vector to transient dynamics in limit-cycling systems. We
illustrate the utility of the proposed reduction framework by estimating
optimal injection timing of external input that efficiently suppresses
deviations of the system state from the limit cycle in a model of a biochemical

designed for image-based tasks such as object recognition to video. Such
extensions are typically trained for actions on single video frames or very

sequence are pooled for recognizing the action at the sequence level. Usually
this pooling step uses the first-order statistics of frame-level action
predictions. In this paper, we explore the advantages of using higher-order

generated from the late fusion of CNN classifier scores from all the frames in
a sequence. To generate these descriptors, we use the idea of kernel
linearization. Specifically, a similarity kernel matrix, which captures the
temporal evolution of deep classifier scores, is first linearized into kernel
feature maps. The HOK descriptors are then generated from the higher-order
co-occurrences of these feature maps, and are then used as input to a
video-level classifier. We provide experiments on two fine-grained action

hydrostatic reconstruction techniques designed to preserve low-Shapiro number
steady states that may occur in large network simulations. The Shapiro number S
h = u/c is the equivalent of the Froude number for shallow water equations and
the Mach number for compressible Euler equations. The first is the low-Shapiro
hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-LS), which is a simple and efficient method,
inspired from the hydrostatic reconstruction technique (HR). The second is the
subsonic hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-S), adapted here to blood flow and
designed to exactly preserve all subcritical steady states. We systematically
compare HR, HR-LS and HR-S in a series of single artery and arterial network
numerical tests designed to evaluate their well-balanced and wave-capturing
properties. The results indicate that HR is not adapted to compute blood flow
in large arteries as it is unable to capture wave reflections and transmissions
when large variations of the arteries' geometrical and mechanical properties
are considered. On the contrary, HR-S is exactly well-balanced and is the most
accurate hydrostatic reconstruction technique. However, HR-LS is able to
compute low-Shapiro number steady states as well as wave reflections and
transmissions with satisfying accuracy and is simpler and computationally less
expensive than HR-S. We therefore recommend using HR-LS for 1D blood flow
simulations in large arterial network simulations.

important area of research. However, much of the current literature neglects
one important feature of many queueing systems, namely non-stationary arrivals.
Non-stationary arrivals model the fact that customers tend to access services
during certain times of the day and not at a constant rate. In this paper, we
analyze two two-dimensional deterministic fluid models that incorporate
customer choice behavior based on delayed queue length information with time
varying arrivals. In the first model, customers receive queue length
information that is delayed by a constant Delta. In the second model, customers
receive information about the queue length through a moving average of the
queue length where the moving average window is Delta. We analyze the impact of
the time varying arrival rate and show using asymptotic analysis that the time
varying arrival rate does not impact the critical delay unless the frequency of
the time varying arrival rate is twice that of the critical delay. When the
frequency of the arrival rate is twice that of the critical delay, then the
stability is enlarged by a wedge that is determined by the model parameters. As
a result, this problem allows us to combine the theory of nonlinear dynamics,
parametric excitation, delays, and time varying queues together to provide
insight on the impact of information in queueing systems.

is accompanied by twisting motion, where individual spin components rotate in
opposite directions with larger orbital angular momenta than the full system,
possibly leading to easier experimental observation of the effect. This feature
is induced by the deformation of the Fermi surface and the direction of the
twisting motion can be controlled by an s-wave scattering length or external
magnetic field, possibly providing a method of measuring scattering lengths of
strongly dipolar atomic species.

of the payment deductions. Under optimal criterion of minimizing the
conditional tail expectation (CTE) risk measure of the insurer's total risk,
this article generalized an optimal stop-loss reinsurance policy to an optimal
multi-layer reinsurance policy. To achieve such optimal multi-layer reinsurance
policy, this article starts from a given optimal stop-loss reinsurance policy
$f(\cdot).$ In the first step, it cuts down an interval $[0,\infty)$ into two
intervals $[0,M_1)$ and $[M_1,\infty).$ By shifting the origin of Cartesian
coordinate system to $(M_{1},f(M_{1})),$ and showing that under the $CTE$
criteria $f(x)I_{[0, M_1)}(x)+(f(M_1)+f(x-M_1))I_{[M_1,\infty)}(x)$ is, again,
an optimal policy. This extension procedure can be repeated to obtain an
optimal k-layer reinsurance policy. Finally, unknown parameters of the optimal
multi-layer reinsurance policy are estimated using some additional appropriate
criteria. Three simulation-based studies have been conducted to demonstrate:
({\bf 1}) The practical applications of our findings and ({\bf 2}) How one may
employ other appropriate criteria to estimate unknown parameters of an optimal
multi-layer contract. The multi-layer reinsurance policy, similar to the
original stop-loss reinsurance policy is optimal, in a same sense. Moreover it
has some other optimal criteria which the original policy does not have. Under
optimal criterion of minimizing general translative and monotone risk measure
$\rho(\cdot)$ of {\it either} the insurer's total risk {\it or} both the
insurer's and the reinsurer's total risks, this article (in its discussion)
also extends a given optimal reinsurance contract $f(\cdot)$ to a multi-layer
and continuous reinsurance policy.

previously unseen pre-maximum, spectroscopic heterogeneity. While the light
curve and post-maximum spectra of PS1-12bwh are virtually identical to those of
the well-studied type Iax supernova, SN 2005hk, the $-$2 day spectrum of
PS1-12bwh does not resemble SN 2005hk at a comparable epoch; instead, we found
it to match a spectrum of SN 2005hk taken over a week earlier ($-$12 day). We
are able to rule out the cause as being incorrect phasing, and argue that it is
not consistent with orientation effects predicted by existing explosion
simulations. To investigate the potential source of this difference, we
performed radiative transfer modelling of both supernovae. We found that the
pre-maximum spectrum of PS1-12bwh is well matched by a synthetic spectrum
generated from a model with a lower density in the high velocity ($\gtrsim$6000
km~s$^{-1}$) ejecta than SN 2005hk. The observed differences between SN 2005hk
and PS1-12bwh may therefore be attributed primarily to differences in the high
velocity ejecta alone, while comparable densities for the lower velocity ejecta
would explain the nearly identical post-maximum spectra. These two supernovae
further highlight the diversity within the SNe Iax class, as well as the
challenges in spectroscopically identifying and phasing these objects,

direct consequence of reflection positivity in radially quantized CFT$_3$ and
the fact that scaling dimensions of operators are energies of states. The
partial massless states appearing in de Sitter correspond from the boundary

asymptotic symmetries have a nice quantum mechanics interpretation. For
instance, acting with the asymptotic dilation symmetry corresponds to evolving
states forward (or backward) in ""time"" and the charge generating the asymptotic
symmetry transformation is the Hamiltonian itself. Finally, we investigate the
symmetries of anisotropic inflation and show that correlators of

decisions about the ordering of operations to be delayed, mirroring the

events that require stopping and restoring the execution of an app while
leaving its state unaltered. These events can be caused by run-time
configuration changes, such as a screen rotation, and by context-switches, such
as a switch from one app to another. When a stop-start event occurs, Android
saves the state of the app, handles the event, and finally restores the saved
state. To let Android save and restore the state correctly, apps must provide
the appropriate support. Unfortunately, Android developers often implement this
support incorrectly, or do not implement it at all. This bad practice makes
apps to incorrectly react to stop-start events, thus generating what we defined
data loss problems, that is Android apps that lose user data, behave
unexpectedly, and crash due to program variables that lost their values. Data
loss problems are difficult to detect because they might be observed only when
apps are in specific states and with specific inputs. Covering all the possible
cases with testing may require a large number of test cases whose execution
must be checked manually to discover whether the app under test has been
correctly restored after each stop-start event. It is thus important to
complement traditional in-house testing activities with mechanisms that can
protect apps as soon as a data loss problem occurs in the field. In this paper
we present DataLossHealer, a technique for automatically identifying and
healing data loss problems in the field as soon as they occur. DataLossHealer
is a technique that checks at run-time whether states are recovered correctly,

  Workshop and Conference , Jan 2017, Las Vegas, United States",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A cognitive radio system has the ability to observe and learn from the
environment, adapt to the environmental conditions, and use the radio spectrum
more efficiently. However, due to multipath fading, shadowing, or varying
channel conditions, uncertainty affects the cognitive cycle processes,
measurements, decisions, and actions. In the observing step, measurements
(i.e., information) taken by the secondary users (SUs) are uncertain. In the
next step, the SUs make decisions based on what has already been observed using
their knowledge bases, which may have been impacted by the uncertainty, leading
to wrong decisions. In the last step, uncertainty can affect the decision of
the cognitive radio system, which sometimes can lead to the wrong action. Thus,
the uncertainty propagation influences the cognitive radio performance.
Therefore, mitigating the uncertainty in the cognitive cycle is a necessity.
This paper provides a deep overview of techniques that handle uncertainty in
cognitive radio networks.

In particular, we first focus on the class of field redefinitions linear in the
spin-2 field and involving derivatives of the spin-0 mode, generically known as
disformal transformations. We start by defining the action of a disformal
transformation in the tangent space. Then, we take advantage of the great
economy of means of the language of differential forms to compute the full
transformation of Horndeski's theory under general disformal transformations.
We obtain that Horndeski's action maps onto itself modulo a reduced set of
non-Horndeski Lagrangians. These new Lagrangians are found to be invariant
under disformal transformation that depend only in the first derivatives of the
scalar. Moreover, these combinations of Lagrangians precisely appear when
expressing in our basis the constraints of the recently proposed Extended
Scalar-Tensor (EST) theories. These results allow us to classify the different
orbits of scalar-tensor theories invariant under particular disformal
transformations, namely the special disformal, kinetic disformal and disformal
Horndeski orbits. In addition, we consider generalizations of this framework.
We find that there are possible well-defined extended disformal transformations
that have not been considered in the literature. However, they generically
cannot link Horndeski theory with EST theories. Finally, we study further
generalizations in which extra fields with different spin are included. These
field redefinitions can be used to connect different gravity theories such as
multi-scalar-tensor theories, generalized Proca theories and bi-gravity. We
discuss how the formalism of differential forms could be useful for future
developments in these lines.

during inflation, and study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature
and polarization bispectra arising from the mixing between the scalar mode and
the massive tensor mode during inflation. The model assumes the existence of a
preferred spatial frame during inflation. The local Lorentz invariance is
already broken in cosmology due to the existence of a preferred rest frame. The
existence of a preferred spatial frame further breaks the remaining local SO(3)
invariance and in particular gives rise to a mass in the tensor mode. At linear
perturbation level, we minimize our model so that the vector mode remains
non-dynamical, while the scalar mode is the same as the one in single-field
slow-roll inflation. At non-linear perturbation level, this inflationary
massive graviton phase leads to a sizeable scalar-scalar-tensor coupling, much
greater than the scalar-scalar-scalar one, as opposed to the conventional case.
This scalar-scalar-tensor interaction imprints a scale dependent feature in the
CMB temperature and polarization bispectra. Very intriguingly, we find a
surprizing similarity between the predicted scale dependence and the
scale-dependent non-Gaussianities at low multipoles hinted in the WMAP and
Planck results.

methane storage by orders of magnitude by only modifying the pore structure
(1,2). For these applications it is therefore important to identify the optimal
pore geometry and use this information to find similar materials. However, the
mathematical language and tools to identify materials with similar pore
structures, but different composition, has been lacking. Here we develop a pore
recognition approach to quantify similarity of pore structures and classify
them using topological data analysis (3,4). Our approach allows us to identify
materials with similar pore geometries, and to screen for materials that are
similar to given top-performing structures. Using methane storage as a case
study, we also show that materials can be divided into topologically distinct
classes -- and that each class requires different optimization strategies. In
this work we have focused on pore space, but our topological approach can be
generalised to quantify similarity of any geometric object, which, given the
many different Materials Genomics initiatives (5,6), opens many interesting

arbitrary degree distribution, degree-degree correlations and, in case of
threshold models, with arbitrary threshold distribution. With our approach, we
shift the perspective from the known branching process approximations to the
iterative update of suitable probability distributions. Such distributions are
key to capture cascade dynamics that involve possibly continuous quantities and
that depend on the cascade history, e.g. if load is accumulated over time.
These distributions respect the Markovian nature of the studied random
processes. Random variables capture the impact of nodes that have failed at any
point in the past on their neighborhood. As a proof of concept, we provide two
examples: (a) Constant load models that cover many of the analytically
tractable cascade models, and, as a highlight, (b) a fiber bundle model that
was not tractable by branching process approximations before. Our derivations
cover the whole cascade dynamics, not only their steady state. This allows to
include interventions in time or further model complexity in the analysis.

issue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile.
  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model of the device
can be used to understand the underlying physical and chemical phenomena.
However, such simulations are very time-consuming and neither convenient for
investigations of whole circuits nor for real-time applications, e.g. emulation
purposes. Instead, a concentrated model of the device can be used for both fast
simulations and real-time applications, respectively. We introduce an enhanced
