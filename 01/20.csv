nuclear energy density functional, which leads to the $\alpha$ potential inside
the parent nucleus in terms of the proton and neutron density profiles of the
daughter nucleus. We use the Skyrme force model, Gogny force model, and
relativistic mean field model to get the nucleon density profiles inside heavy
nuclei. Once the nucleon density profiles are determined, the parameters of the
nuclear $\alpha$ potential are fitted to the observed $\alpha$ decay half-lives
of heavy nuclei. This approach is then applied to predict unknown $\alpha$
decay half-lives of heavy nuclei. To estimate the $Q$ values of unobserved
$\alpha$ decays, we make use of the liquid droplet model.

Hajirasouliha and Raphael (WABI 2014), Hujdurovi\'c et al. (IEEE TCBB, to

each row of a given binary matrix into a bitwise OR of a set of rows so that
the resulting matrix corresponds to a perfect phylogeny and has the minimum
possible number of rows among all matrices with this property. Hajirasouliha
and Raphael also proposed the study of a similar problem, in which the task is
to minimize the number of distinct rows of the resulting matrix. Hujdurovi\'c
et al. proved that both problems are NP-hard, gave a related characterization
of transitively orientable graphs, and proposed a polynomial-time heuristic
algorithm for the MCRS problem based on coloring cocomparability graphs.
  We give new, more transparent formulations of the two problems, showing that
the problems are equivalent to two optimization problems on branchings in a
derived directed acyclic graph. Building on these formulations, we obtain new
results on the two problems, including: (i) a strengthening of the heuristic by
Hujdurovi\'c et al. via a new min-max result in digraphs generalizing
Dilworth's theorem, which may be of independent interest, (ii) APX-hardness
results for both problems, (iii) approximation algorithms, and (iv)
exponential-time algorithms solving the two problems to optimality faster than
the na\""ive brute-force approach. Our work relates to several well studied
notions in combinatorial optimization: chain partitions in partially ordered
sets, laminar hypergraphs, and (classical and weighted) colorings of graphs.

output results of large-scale mathematical models to some uncertainties of the
input data. The models are described as a system of partial differential
equations. Often such systems contain a large number of input parameters.
Obviously, it is important to know how sensitive is the solution to some
uncontrolled variations or uncertainties in the input parameters of the model.
Algorithms based on analysis of variances technique (ANOVA) for calculating
numerical indicators of sensitivity and computationally efficient Monte Carlo
integration techniques have recently been developed by the authors. They have
been successfully applied to sensitivity studies of air pollution levels
calculated by the Unified Danish Eulerian Model (UNI-DEM) with respect to
several important input parameters. In this paper a comprehensive theoretical
and experimental study of the Monte Carlo algorithm based on
\textit{symmetrised shaking} of Sobol sequences has been done. It has been
proven that this algorithm has an optimal rate of convergence for functions
with continuous and bounded second derivatives in terms of probability and mean
square error. Extensive numerical experiments with Monte Carlo, quasi-Monte
Carlo (QMC) and scrambled quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms based on Sobol sequences
are performed to support the theoretical studies and to analyze applicability
of the algorithms to various classes of problems. The numerical tests show that
the Monte Carlo algorithm based on \textit{symmetrised shaking} of Sobol
sequences gives reliable results for multidimensional integration problems
under consideration.

field theory naturally incorporates these results. We investigate the operator
formalism description of the ambitwsitor string and propose an action for the
string field theory of the bosonic and supersymmetric theories. The correct

cosmic-ray air showers provides an alternative to air-Cherenkov and
air-fluorescence detection, since it is not limited to clear nights. Like these
established methods, the radio signal is sensitive to the calorimetric energy
and the position of the maximum of the electromagnetic shower component. This
makes antenna arrays an ideal extension for particle-detector arrays above a
threshold energy of about 100 PeV of the primary cosmic-ray particles. In the
last few years the digital radio technique for cosmic-ray air showers again
made significant progress, and there now is a consistent picture of the
emission mechanisms confirmed by several measurements. Recent results by the
antenna arrays AERA and Tunka-Rex confirm that the absolute accuracy for the
shower energy is as good as the other detection techniques. Moreover, the
sensitivity to the shower maximum of the radio signal has been confirmed in
direct comparison to air-Cherenkov measurements by Tunka-Rex. The dense antenna
array LOFAR can already compete with the established techniques in accuracy for
cosmic-ray mass-composition. In the future, a new generation of radio
experiments might drive the field: either by providing extremely large exposure
for inclined cosmic-ray or neutrino showers or, like the SKA core in Australia
with its several 10,000 antennas, by providing extremely detailed measurements.

solutions, their underlying principles and their research type facets, i.e.
their state of empirical evidence. Method: To this end, we conducted a
systematic mapping study of the REPI publication space. Results: This paper
reports on the first findings regarding research type facets of the
contributions as well as selected methodological principles. We found a strong
focus in the existing research on solution proposals for REPI approaches that
concentrate on normative assessments and benchmarks of the RE activities rather
than on holistic RE improvements according to individual goals of companies.

to investigate more problem-driven REPI which also targets the improvement of
the quality of the underlying RE artefacts, which currently seem out of scope.

thirty industry-relevant objects with no significant texture and no
discriminative color or reflectance properties. The objects exhibit symmetries
and mutual similarities in shape and/or size. Compared to other datasets, a
unique property is that some of the objects are parts of others. The dataset
includes training and test images that were captured with three synchronized
sensors, specifically a structured-light and a time-of-flight RGB-D sensor and
a high-resolution RGB camera. There are approximately 39K training and 10K test
images from each sensor. Additionally, two types of 3D models are provided for
each object, i.e. a manually created CAD model and a semi-automatically
reconstructed one. Training images depict individual objects against a black
background. Test images originate from twenty test scenes having varying
complexity, which increases from simple scenes with several isolated objects to
very challenging ones with multiple instances of several objects and with a
high amount of clutter and occlusion. The images were captured from a
systematically sampled view sphere around the object/scene, and are annotated
with accurate ground truth 6D poses of all modeled objects. Initial evaluation
results indicate that the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation has
ample room for improvement, especially in difficult cases with significant
occlusion. The T-LESS dataset is available online at cmp.felk.cvut.cz/t-less.

determinants of T cell fate and effector function. A number of inflammatory
diseases are characterized by an altered balance of T cell phenotypes and
cytokine secretion. STATs, therefore, represent viable therapeutic targets in
numerous pathologies. However, the underlying mechanisms of how the same STAT
proteins regulate both the development of different T cell phenotypes and their
plasticity during changes in extracellular conditions remain unclear. In this
study, we investigated the STAT mediated regulation of T cell phenotype
formation and plasticity using mathematical modeling and experimental data for
intracellular STAT signaling proteins. The close fit of our model predictions
to the experimental data for IFN-{\gamma} to IL-10 switching allows us to
propose a potential mechanism for T cell switching that regulates human Th1/Tr1
responses. According to this mechanism, T cell phenotype switching is due to
the relative redistribution of STAT dimer complexes caused by the extracellular
cytokine-dependent STAT competition effects. The proposed model is applicable
to a number of STAT signaling circuits.

width of the heat-flux to divertor plates in attached plasma condition. The
simulation results are validated against the empirical scaling $\lambda_q
\propto B_P^{-\gamma}$ obtained from present tokamak devices, where $\lambda_q$
is the divertor heat-flux width mapped to the outboard midplane and
$\gamma_q=1.19$ as defined by T. Eich et al. [Nucl. Fusion 53 (2013) 093031],
and $B_P$ is the magnitude of the poloidal magnetic field at outboard midplane
separatrix surface. This empirical scaling predicts $\lambda_q \leq 1mm$ when
extrapolated to ITER, which would require operation with very high separatrix
densities $(n_{sep}/n_{Greenwald} > 0.6)$ in the Q=10 scenario to achieve
semi-detached plasma operation and high radiative fractions leading to
acceptable divertor power fluxes. XGC1 predicts, however, that $\lambda_q$ for
ITER is over 5 mm, suggesting that operation in the ITER Q=10 scenario with
acceptable divertor power loads could be obtained over a wider range of plasma
separatrix densities and radiative fractions. The physics reason behind this
difference is, according to the XGC1 results, that while the ion magnetic drift
contribution to the divertor heat-flux width is wider in the present tokamaks,
the turbulent electron contribution is wider in ITER. A high current C-Mod
discharge is found to be in a mixed regime: While the heat-flux width by the
ion neoclassical magnetic drift is still wider than the turbulent electron
heat-flux width, the heat-flux magnitude is dominated by the narrower electron
heat-flux.

cloud environments, and explaining outputs of Big Data analytics. A
well-established technique is to represent provenance as annotations on data
and to instrument queries to propagate these annotations to produce results
annotated with provenance. However, even sophisticated optimizers are often
incapable of producing efficient execution plans for instrumented queries,
because of their inherent complexity and unusual structure. Thus, while
instrumentation enables provenance support for databases without requiring any
modification to the DBMS, the performance of this approach is far from optimal.
In this work, we develop provenance specific optimizations to address this
problem. Specifically, we introduce algebraic equivalences targeted at
instrumented queries and discuss alternative, equivalent ways of instrumenting
a query for provenance capture. Furthermore, we present an extensible heuristic
and cost-based optimization (CBO) framework that governs the application of
these optimizations and implement this framework in our GProM provenance
system. Our CBO is agnostic to the plan space shape, uses a DBMS for cost
estimation, and enables retrofitting of optimization choices into existing code
by adding a few LOC. Our experiments confirm that these optimizations are
highly effective, often improving performance by several orders of magnitude
for diverse provenance tasks.

modulation $\theta$ using a general -- possibly entangled -- $n$-mode optical
probe through $n$ independent and identical uses of a lossy bosonic channel
with additive thermal noise. We find an upper bound to the quantum Fisher
information (QFI) of estimating $\theta$ as a function of $n$, the mean and
variance of the total number of photons $N_{\rm S}$ in the $n$-mode probe, the
transmissivity $\eta$ and mean thermal photon number per mode ${\bar n}_{\rm
B}$ of the bosonic channel. Since the inverse of QFI provides a lower bound to
the mean-squared error (MSE) of an unbiased estimator $\tilde{\theta}$ of
$\theta$, our upper bound to the QFI provides a lower bound to the MSE. It
already has found use in proving fundamental limits of covert sensing, and
could find other applications requiring bounding the fundamental limits of
sensing an unknown parameter embedded in a correlated field.

with a promise for many applications. However, their use in ion sieving and
desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of ~9 Angstrom,
which is larger than hydrated ion diameters for common salts. The cutoff is
determined by the interlayer spacing d ~13.5 Angstrom, typical for graphene
oxide laminates that swell in water. Achieving smaller d for the laminates
immersed in water has proved to be a challenge.Here we describe how to control
d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tuneable ion sieving.
Membranes with d from ~ 9.8 Angstrom to 6.4 Angstrom are demonstrated,
providing the sieve size smaller than typical ions' hydrated diameters.In this
regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers
of ~10-100 kJ/mol depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease
exponentially with decreasing the sieve size but water transport is weakly
affected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for
water molecules entry and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries.
Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain
graphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for
NaCl.

often in varied contexts or over time. Trade flows between countries, financial
transactions between individuals, contact frequencies between school children

relational arrays. Elements of a relational array are often modeled as a linear
function of observable covariates. Uncertainty estimates for regression
coefficient estimators -- and ideally the coefficient estimators themselves --
must account for dependence between elements of the array (e.g. relations
involving the same actor) and existing estimators of standard errors that
recognize such relational dependence rely on estimating extremely complex,
heterogeneous structure across actors. This paper develops a new class of
parsimonious coefficient and standard error estimators for regressions of
relational arrays. We leverage an exchangeability assumption to derive standard
error estimators that pool information across actors and are substantially more
accurate than existing estimators in a variety of settings. This
exchangeability assumption is pervasive in network and array models in the
statistics literature, but not previously considered when adjusting for
dependence in a regression setting with relational data. We demonstrate
improvements in inference theoretically, via a simulation study, and by
analysis of a data set involving international trade.

Jupiter in its journey around the Sun and a similarly large population may be
hosted by Neptune. In addition, recently captured or transient Jovian and
Neptunian Trojans are not uncommon. In contrast, no Trojans of Saturn have been
found yet and just one Uranian Trojan is known, 2011 QF99. Here, we discuss the
identification of a second Trojan of Uranus: 2014 YX49. Like 2011 QF99, 2014
YX49 is a transient L4 Trojan although it orbits at higher inclination (25.55
degrees versus 10.83 degrees), is larger (absolute magnitude of 8.5 versus 9.7)
and its libration period is slightly shorter (5.1 versus 5.9 kyr); contrary to
2011 QF99, its discovery was not the result of a targeted survey. It is less
stable than 2011 QF99; our extensive N-body simulations show that 2014 YX49 may
have been following a tadpole trajectory ahead of Uranus for about 60 kyr and
it can continue doing so for another 80 kyr. Our analysis suggests that it may
remain as co-orbital for nearly 1 Myr. As in the case of 2011 QF99, the
long-term stability of 2014 YX49 is controlled by Jupiter and Neptune, but it
is currently trapped in the 7:20 mean motion resonance with Saturn.
Consistently, the dynamical mechanism leading to the capture into and the
ejection from the Trojan state involves ephemeral multibody mean motion
resonances.

allows these representations to depend on two, rather than one, sets of

topological quantum field theory description, which microscopically justifies
the fractional $S$-duality. Then, we consider stacking operations (i.e., a
direct sum of Hamiltonians) among FTIs. We find that there are two
topologically distinct classes of FTIs: type-I and type-II. Type-I
($t\in\mathbb{Z}_{\rm odd}$) can be obtained by directly stacking a
non-interacting topological insulator and a fractionalized gapped fermionic
state with minimal charge $1/t$ and vanishing $\theta$. But type-II
($t\in\mathbb{Z}_{\rm even}$) cannot be realized through any stacking. Finally,
we study the Surface Topological Order of fractional topological insulators.

worlds, and will yield key results for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.
However, transit spectra models are often simplified, omitting potentially
important processes like refraction and multiple scattering. While the former
process has seen recent development, the effects of light multiple scattering
on exoplanet transit spectra has received little attention. Here, we develop a
detailed theory of exoplanet transit spectroscopy that extends to the full
refracting and multiple scattering case. We explore the importance of
scattering for planet-wide cloud layers, where the relevant parameters are the
slant scattering optical depth, the scattering asymmetry parameter, and the
angular size of the host star. The latter determines the size of the ""target""
for a photon that is back-mapped from an observer. We provide results that
straightforwardly indicate the potential importance of multiple scattering for
transit spectra. When the orbital distance is smaller than 10-20 times the
stellar radius, multiple scattering effects for aerosols with asymmetry
parameters larger than 0.8-0.9 can become significant. We provide examples of
the impacts of cloud/haze multiple scattering on transit spectra of a hot
Jupiter-like exoplanet. For cases with a forward and conservatively scattering
cloud/haze, differences due to multiple scattering effects can exceed 200 ppm,
but shrink to zero at wavelength ranges corresponding to strong gas absorption
or when the slant optical depth of the cloud exceeds several tens. We conclude
with a discussion of types of aerosols for which multiple scattering in transit
spectra may be important.

winding numbers $n>M_p/f$, the EFT is under control and the string cores
undergo topological inflation, which may be either of exponential or power-law

decompactifying cigar geometry, with the radion rolling in a potential
generated by axion flux. Signals are able to circumnavigate infinite straight
strings in finite but exponentially long time, $t\sim e^{\Delta a/M_p}$. For
finite loops of supercritical string in asymptotically flat space, we argue
that if topological inflation occurs, then topological censorship implies

quasiparticles do not harness the valley-sensitive excitations of monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we demonstrate evidence for valley
polarized exciton-polaritons in monolayers of MoS$_2$ embedded in a dielectric
microcavity. Unlike traditional microcavity exciton-polaritons, these
light-matter quasiparticles emit polarized light with spectral Rabi splitting.
The interplay of cavity-modified exciton dynamics and intervalley relaxation in
the high-cooperativity regime causes valley polarized exciton-polaritons to
persist to room temperature, distinct from the vanishing polarization in bare
monolayers. Achieving polarization-sensitive polaritonic devices operating at
room temperature presents a pathway for manipulating novel valley degrees of
freedom in coherent states of light and matter.

provided based on the idea of ternary image as there are certain pixels in

Kerberos and Hydra, of the Pluto-Charon system, have not tidally spun-down to
near synchronous spin states and have high obliquities with respect to their
orbit about the Pluto-Charon binary (Weaver et al. 2016). We use a damped
mass-spring model within an N-body simulation to study spin and obliquity
evolution for single spinning non-round bodies in circumbinary orbit.
Simulations with tidal dissipation alone do not show strong obliquity
variations from tidally induced spin-orbit resonance crossing and this we
attribute to the high satellite spin rates and low orbital eccentricities.
However, a tidally evolving Styx exhibits intermittent obliquity variations and
episodes of tumbling. During a previous epoch where Charon migrated away from
Pluto, the minor satellites could have been trapped in orbital mean motion
inclination resonances. An outward migrating Charon induces large variations in
Nix and Styx's obliquities. The cause is a commensurability between the mean
motion resonance frequency and the spin precession rate of the spinning body.
As the minor satellites are near mean motion resonances, this mechanism could
have lifted the obliquities of all four minor satellites. The high obliquities
need not be primordial if the minor satellites were at one time captured into
mean motion resonances.

Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to extract regularities of audio signal in
both time and frequency. Then, it is shown that cipher-texts can be considered
as a set of scrambled puzzles. Then different techniques such as estimation,
image processing, branch and bound, and graph theory are fused together to
create and solve these puzzles. After extracting the keys from the solved
puzzles, they are applied on the scrambled signal. Conducted tests show that
the proposed method achieves objective and subjective intelligibility of 87.8%
and 92.9%. These scores are 50.9% and 34.6% higher than scores of previous
method.

resolution (R~45000) and instantaneous broad wavelength coverage (1.45-2.45
microns), enabling us to detect 87 emission lines from rovibrationally excited
molecular hydrogen (H_2) that arise from transitions out of 69 upper
rovibration levels of the electronic ground state. These levels cover a large
range of rotational and vibrational quantum numbers and excitation energies,
making them an excellent probe of the excitation mechanisms of H_2 and physical
conditions within the PDR. The Orion Bar PDR is thought to consist of cooler
high density clumps or filaments (T=50-250 K, n_H = 10^5 - 10^7 cm^-3) embedded
in a warmer lower density medium (T=250-1000 K, n_H=10^4 - 10^5 cm^-3). We fit
a grid of simple constant-temperature and constant-density Cloudy models, which
recreate the observed H_2 level populations well, to constrain the temperature
to a range of 600 to 650 K and the density to n_H = 2.5 x 10^3 to 10^4 cm^-3.
The best fit model gives T = 625 K and n_H = 5x10^3 cm^-3. This well
constrained warm temperature is consistent with kinetic temperatures found by
other studies for the Orion Bar's lower density medium. However, the range of
densities well fit by the model grid is marginally lower than those reported by
other studies. We could be observing lower density gas than the surrounding
medium, or perhaps a density-sensitive parameter in our models is not properly
estimated.

vector mosquitoes. The trade in second-hand tires has been implicated as a
factor in this process as they act as mobile reservoirs of mosquito eggs and
larvae. Regional transportation of tires can create linkages between rural
areas with dengue to disease-free urban areas, potentially giving rise to
outbreaks even in areas with strong local control measures. In this work we
sought to model the dynamics of mosquito transportation via the tire trade, in
particular to predict its role in causing unexpected dengue outbreaks through
vertical transmission of the virus across generations of mosquitoes. We also
aimed to identify strategies for regulating the trade in second-hand tires,
improving disease control. We created a mathematical model which captures the
dynamics of dengue between rural and urban areas, taking into account the
movement, storage time of tires, and mosquito diapause. We simulate a series of
scenarios. First a mosquito population is introduced to a dengue-free area via
movement of tires, either as single or multiple events, increasing the
likelihood of a dengue outbreak. An endemic state can be induced regardless of
whether urban conditions for an outbreak are met, and an existing endemic state
can be enhanced by vector input. Finally we assess the potential for regulation
of tire processing as a means of reducing the transmission of dengue fever
using a specific case study from Puerto Rico. Our work demonstrates the
importance of the second-hand tire trade in modulating the spread of dengue
fever across regions, in particular its role in introducing dengue to
disease-free areas. We propose that regulation of tire storage and movement can
play a crucial role in containing outbreaks and dengue spread.

a representative sample of FRII radio galaxies with well-characterized
group/cluster environments. We used X-ray inverse-Compton and radio synchrotron
measurements to determine the internal radio-lobe conditions, and these were
compared with external pressures acting on the lobes, determined from
measurements of the thermal X-ray emission of the group/cluster. Consistent
with previous work, we found that FRII radio lobes are typically
electron-dominated by a small factor relative to equipartition, and are
over-pressured relative to the external medium in their outer parts. These
results suggest that there is typically no energetically significant proton
population in the lobes of FRII radio galaxies (unlike for FRIs), and so for
this population, inverse-Compton modelling provides an accurate way of
measuring total energy content and estimating jet power. We estimated the
distribution of Mach numbers for the population of expanding radio lobes,
finding that at least half of the radio galaxies are currently driving strong
shocks into their group/cluster environments. Finally, we determined a jet
power--radio luminosity relation for FRII radio galaxies based on our estimates
of lobe internal energy and Mach number. The slope and normalisation of this
relation are consistent with theoretical expectations, given the departure from
equipartition and environmental distribution for our sample.

aims to fill these gaps by proposing a new set of calibrated features based on

is the most sensitive bit-plane to data hiding algorithms and therefore it can
be employed as a universal embedding method. Furthermore, the proposed features
are based on a model that has the maximum deviation from human auditory system

Performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a wide range of data hiding
algorithms in both targeted and universal paradigms. Simulation results show
that the proposed method can detect the finest traces of data hiding algorithms

inelastic collisions between accelerated ions and thermal gas, at GeV and TeV

between ICCMB and $\pi^0$-decay emission, at some stages, the TeV emission can
be dominated by the former and the GeV by the latter, resulting in strong

relies on manually-provided ILD ROIs to extract sampled 2D image patches from
CT slices and, from there, performs patch-based ILD categorization. Acquiring
manual ROIs is labor intensive and serves as a bottleneck towards
fully-automated CT imaging ILD screening over large-scale populations.
Furthermore, despite the considerable high frequency of more than one ILD
pattern on a single CT slice, previous works are only designed to detect one
ILD pattern per slice or patch.
  To tackle these two critical challenges, we present multi-label deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting ILDs from holistic CT slices

performance on detecting four major ILD patterns: Ground Glass, Reticular,

parameter at which the supersolid exhibits a quantum phase transition to a
fragmented state. The wavelength of the fragmented-condensate solid is defined
by the balance between the quantum pressure and the entropy due to fluctuations
of the relative phases between the fragments. Our model appears to be in good
agreement with the relevant experimental data, including the very recent
results on commensurability effect and wavelength of the MOES.

intervening ${\MgII}$ absorbers spanning redshifts $0.1 < z < 2.6$. We employ
an accurate, automated approach to line detection which consistently detects
redshifted absorption lines. We measure the equivalent widths, apparent optical
depth column densities, and velocity widths for each absorbing system. Using
our complete sample of all detectable ${\MgII}$ absorbers, we can accurately
determine the redshift path density of absorbers across cosmic time. We measure
evolution in the comoving ${\MgII}$ line density, $dN\,/dX$, finding more high
equivalent width absorbers at $z = 2$ than at present. We also measure
evolution in the equivalent width distribution, parameterized by a Schechter
function fit, finding a shallower weak-end slope for absorbers at redshifts
between $1.53 < z < 2.64$ as compared to lower redshifts. Finally, we calculate
the cosmic mass fraction of ${\MgII}$ using the column density distribution. We
find that weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers, those with equivalent widths less than

${\MgII}$ absorbers, which have equivalent widths greater than $1.0$~{\AA}.

Instead, they suggested that the large distances are most consistent with
binary evolution scenarios. To test these suggestions, we modelled young
stellar clusters and their passive dissolution, and we find that, indeed, the
standard single-star evolution model is mostly inconsistent with the observed
LBV environments. If LBVs are single stars, then the lifetimes inferred from
their luminosity and mass are far too short to be consistent with their extreme
isolation. This implies that there is either an inconsistency in the
luminosity- to-mass mapping or the mass-to-age mapping. In this paper, we
explore binary solutions that modify the mass-to-age mapping and are consistent
with the isolation of LBVs. For the binary scenarios, our crude models suggest
that LBVs are rejuvenated stars. They are either the result of mergers or they
are mass gainers and received a kick when the primary star exploded. In the
merger scenario, if the primary is about 19 solar masses, then the binary has
enough time to wander far afield, merge and form a rejuvenated star. In the
mass-gainer and kick scenario, we find that LBV isolation is consistent with a
wide range of kick velocities, anywhere from 0 to ~ 105 km/s. In either
scenario, binarity seems to play a major role in the isolation of LBVs.

photoexcitation conditions. We identify an anomalous temperature dependent
broadening mechanism and that defects other than the substitutional nitrogen

suggests the presence of a strong Jahn-Teller effect in the center's singlet

propose that the IR ZPL can be used as a sensitive spectroscopic tool for
probing microscopic strain fields and performing defect tomography.

Heisenberg interactions as well as a local single-ion spin anisotropy that is
allowed by the spin-one nature of the local moment and the tetragonal symmetry
of the system. We point out that there exists a quantum phase transition from a
trivial quantum paramagnet when the single-ion spin anisotropy is dominant to
the magnetic ordered states when the exchange is dominant. Due to the
frustrated spin interaction, the magnetic excitation in the quantum
paramagnetic state supports extensively degenerate band minima in the spectra.
As the system approaches the transition, extensively degenerate bosonic modes
become critical at the criticality, giving rise to unusual magnetic properties.
Our phase diagram and experimental predictions for different phases provide a
guildeline for the identification of the ground state for NiRh$_2$O$_4$.
Although our results are fundamentally different from the proposal of
topological quantum paramagnet, it represents interesting possibilities for

A weak LEDPUF is constructed by forming arrays of Directed Self Assembly (DSA)

the weak LEDPUF as the key of a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC).
Our simulation and statistical results show that the entropy of the weak LEDPUF

guesswork. The guesswork model allows to quantitatively compare, with a single
unified metric, PUFs with varying levels of stability, bias and available side

security level such as min-entropy and mutual information. We evaluate
guesswork-based security of some measured SRAM and Ring Oscillator PUFs as an
example and compare them with LEDPUF to show that stability has a more severe
impact on the PUF security than biased responses. Furthermore, we find the

can be used to construct the simultaneous confidence band of the nonparametric

  Refinement",,,,,"cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new demand-driven flow- and context-sensitive pointer analysis
with strong updates for C programs, called SUPA, that enables computing
points-to information via value-flow refinement, in environments with small
time and memory budgets such as IDEs. We formulate SUPA by solving a graph
reachability problem on an inter-procedural value-flow graph representing a
program's def-use chains, which are pre-computed efficiently but
over-approximately. To answer a client query (a request for a variable's
points-to set), SUPA reasons about the flow of values along the pre-computed
def-use chains sparsely (rather than across all program points), by performing
only the work necessary for the query (rather than analyzing the whole
program). In particular, strong updates are performed to filter out spurious
def-use chains through value-flow refinement as long as the total budget is not
exhausted. SUPA facilitates efficiency and precision tradeoffs by applying
different pointer analyses in a hybrid multi-stage analysis framework.
  We have implemented SUPA in LLVM (3.5.0) and evaluate it by choosing
uninitialized pointer detection as a major client on 18 open-source C programs.
As the analysis budget increases, SUPA achieves improved precision, with its
single-stage flow-sensitive analysis reaching 97.4% of that achieved by
whole-program flow-sensitive analysis by consuming about 0.18 seconds and 65KB
of memory per query, on average (with a budget of at most 10000 value-flow
edges per query). With context-sensitivity also considered, SUPA's two- stage
analysis becomes more precise for some programs but also incurs more analysis
times. SUPA is also amenable to parallelization. A parallel implementation of
its single-stage flow-sensitive analysis achieves a speedup of up to 6.9x with
an average of 3.05x a 8-core machine with respect its sequential version.

fast, albeit suboptimal, but its warping creates a larger, flexible class of
density functions, resulting in substantially improved estimation. The search
for optimal warping is accomplished by mapping diffeomorphic functions to the
tangent space of a Hilbert sphere, a vector space whose elements can be
expressed using an orthogonal basis. Using a truncated basis expansion, we
estimate the optimal warping under a (penalized) likelihood criterion and,
thus, the optimal density estimate. This framework is introduced for
univariate, unconditional pdf estimation and then extended to conditional pdf
estimation. The approach avoids many of the computational pitfalls associated

Since a distinguishing feature of DRPs is that the problem domain is bounded in

the nonlinear system defining a DRP to be stable in the typical sense. In
particular, we study a notion of exponential stability along the discrete
iteration dimension of the 2D dynamics, which requires the boundary data for
the differential pass dynamics to converge to zero as the iterations evolve.
Our main contribution is to show, under standard regularity assumptions, that
exponential stability of a DRP is equivalent to that of its linearized
dynamics. In turn, exponential stability of this linearization can be readily
verified by a spectral radius condition. The application of this result to
Picard iterations and iterative learning control (ILC) is discussed.
Theoretical findings are supported by a numerical simulation of an ILC

distribution while, at the same time, allowing for varying mode, skewness and
tail behavior. It thus overcomes the severe limitation of the asymmetric
Laplace distribution -- the most commonly used error model for parametric
quantile regression -- for which the skewness of the error density is fully
specified when a particular percentile is fixed. We develop a Bayesian
formulation for the proposed quantile regression model, including conditional
lasso regularized quantile regression based on a hierarchical Laplace prior for
the regression coefficients, and a Tobit quantile regression model. Posterior
inference is implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The flexibility
of the new model relative to the asymmetric Laplace distribution is studied
through relevant model properties, and through a simulation experiment to
compare the two error distributions in regularized quantile regression.
Moreover, model performance in linear quantile regression, regularized quantile
regression, and Tobit quantile regression is illustrated with data examples
that have been previously considered in the literature.

unstable predictions can potentially reduce users' trust in a classification

goal of our work is to introduce a novel concept of classification instability,
i.e., decision boundary instability (DBI), and incorporate it with the
generalization error (GE) as a standard for selecting the most accurate and
stable classifier. Specifically, we implement a two-stage algorithm: (i)
initially select a subset of classifiers whose estimated GEs are not
significantly different from the minimal estimated GE among all the candidate
classifiers; (ii) the optimal classifier is chosen as the one achieving the
minimal DBI among the subset selected in stage (i). This general selection
principle applies to both linear and nonlinear classifiers. Large-margin
classifiers are used as a prototypical example to illustrate the above idea.
Our selection method is shown to be consistent in the sense that the optimal

notion of sparsity (called structured sparsity) can improve the sample
complexity in several compressive sensing applications. Recently, Hegde et al.
proposed a framework, called approximation-tolerant model-based compressive
sensing, for recovering signals with structured sparsity. Their framework
requires two oracles, the head- and the tail-approximation projection oracles.
The two oracles should return approximate solutions in the model which is
closest to the query signal. In this paper, we consider two structured sparsity
models and obtain improved projection algorithms. The first one is the tree
sparsity model, which captures the support structure in the wavelet
decomposition of piecewise-smooth signals. We propose a linear time
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for head-approximation projection and a
linear time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for tail-approximation
projection. The best previous result is an $\tilde{O}(n\log n)$ time
bicriterion approximation algorithm (meaning that their algorithm may return a
solution of sparsity larger than $k$) by Hegde et al. Our result provides an
affirmative answer to the open problem mentioned in the survey of Hegde and
Indyk. As a corollary, we can recover a constant approximate $k$-sparse signal.
The other is the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which is useful
to model the situation where the positions of the nonzero coefficients of a
signal do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal)
locations. We obtain the first single criterion constant factor approximation
algorithm for the head-approximation projection. The previous best known
algorithm is a bicriterion approximation. Using this result, we can get a
faster constant approximation algorithm with fewer measurements for the
recovery problem in CEMD model.

the geometric properties of features such as position, scale, and orientation,

the presence of repetitive patterns or with a large viewpoint change, it is
hard to find the correct correspondences using feature descriptors only, since
the descriptor distances of the correct matches may not be the least among the
candidates due to appearance changes. Assuming that the layout of the nearby
features does not changed much, we propose the bidirectional transfer measure
to gauge the geometric consistency of a pair of feature correspondences. The
feature matching problem is formulated as a Markov random field (MRF) which
uses descriptor distances and relative geometric similarities together. The
unmatched features are explicitly modeled in the MRF to minimize its negative
impact. For speed and stability, instead of solving the MRF on the entire
features at once, we start with a small set of confident feature matches, and
then progressively search the candidates in nearby features and expand the MRF
with them. Experimental comparisons show that the proposed algorithm finds
better feature correspondences, i.e. more matches with higher inlier ratio, in
many challenging scenes with much lower computational cost than the

photons. This renders a 1-$\rm\mu m$-scalelength, underdense preplasma
completely opaque to laser pulses at this power level. The QED-induced opacity
therefore sets much higher contrast requirements for such pulse in solid-target
experiments than expected by classical plasma physics. Our simulations show for
example, that proton acceleration from the rear of a solid with a preplasma

considering the shapes of the galaxy surface brightness profile,

systematic errors due to the spatial and velocity structure of the molecular

with decreasing \sersic\ index of the galaxy surface brightness profile. We
validate our arguments using simulated PVDs for varying beam size and velocity
channel width. Furthermore, we consider the systematic effects on the inference
of the SMBH mass by simulating PVDs including the spatial and velocity
structure of the molecular gas, which demonstrates that their impacts are not
significant for a PVD with good S/N unless the spatial and velocity scale
associated with the systematic effects are comparable to or larger than the
angular resolution and velocity channel width of the PVD from pure circular
motion. Also, we caution that a bias in a galaxy surface brightness profile
owing to the poor resolution of a galaxy photometric image can largely bias the
SMBH mass by an order of magnitude. This study shows the promise and the limit

universal resource states for measurement-based quantum computing with only

non-Clifford basis measurements. Furthermore, it is impossible to classically
efficiently sample measurement results on hypergraph states with a constant

computational cost. We run about 15,000 simulations with ~2 billion particles
that provide ~1% accuracy of the dark matter power spectra P(k) for
wave-numbers up to k~ 1h/Mpc. Using this large data-set we study the power
spectrum covariance matrix, the stepping stone for producing mock catalogs. In
contrast to many previous analytical and numerical results, we find that the
covariance matrix normalised to the power spectrum C(k,k')/P(k)P(k') has a
complex structure of non-diagonal components. It has an upturn at small k,
followed by a minimum at k=0.1-0.2h/Mpc. It also has a maximum at
k=0.5-0.6h/Mpc. The normalised covariance matrix strongly evolves with
redshift: C(k,k')~delta(t)^alpha P(k)P(k'), where delta is the linear growth
factor and alpha ~ 1-1.25, which indicates that the covariance matrix depends
on cosmological parameters. We also show that waves longer than 1Gpc have very
little impact on the power spectrum and covariance matrix. This significantly
reduces the computational costs and complexity of theoretical predictions:
relatively small volume ~ (1Gpc)^3 simulations capture the necessary properties
of dark matter clustering statistics. All the power spectra obtained from many

heterogeneous. How to select the most important variables to improve real-time
traffic accident risk prediction has become a concern of many recent studies.
This paper proposes a novel variable selection method based on the Frequent
Pattern tree (FP tree) algorithm. First, all the frequent patterns in the
traffic accident dataset are discovered. Then for each frequent pattern, a new
criterion, called the Relative Object Purity Ratio (ROPR) which we proposed, is
calculated. This ROPR is added to the importance score of the variables that
differentiate one frequent pattern from the others. To test the proposed
method, a dataset was compiled from the traffic accidents records detected by
only one detector on interstate highway I-64 in Virginia in 2005. This dataset
was then linked to other variables such as real-time traffic information and
weather conditions. Both the proposed method based on the FP tree algorithm, as
well as the widely utilized, random forest method, were then used to identify
the important variables or the Virginia dataset. The results indicate that
there are some differences between the variables deemed important by the FP
tree and those selected by the random forest method. Following this, two
baseline models (i.e. a nearest neighbor (k-NN) method and a Bayesian network)
were developed to predict accident risk based on the variables identified by
both the FP tree method and the random forest method. The results show that the
models based on the variable selection using the FP tree performed better than
those based on the random forest method for several versions of the k-NN and
Bayesian network models.The best results were derived from a Bayesian network
model using variables from FP tree. That model could predict 61.11% of
accidents accurately while having a false alarm rate of 38.16%.

radiation pressure. Such levitating atmospheres occupy a position of stable
radial equilibrium, where radiative flux and gravitational effects are
balanced. Using general relativity and an inhomogeneous plasma we find the
existence of a stable circular orbit within the atmospheric shell for
low-frequency rays. We explore families of bound orbits that exist between the
shell and the compact object, and identify sets of novel periodic orbits.
Finally, we examine conditions necessary for the trapping and escape of

semi-static hedge of timing risk associated to positions in American-style
options under a multi-dimensional market model. Barrier options are considered
in the paper and semi-static hedges are studied and discussed for a fairly
large class of underlying price dynamics. Timing risk is identified with the
uncertainty associated to the time at which the payoff payment of the barrier
option is due. Starting from the work by Carr and Picron (1999), where the
authors show that the timing risk can be hedged via static positions in plain
vanilla options, the present paper extends the static hedge formula proposed in
Carr and Picron (1999) by giving sufficient conditions to decompose a
generalized timing risk into an integral of knock-in options in a
multi-dimensional market model. A dedicated study of the semi-static hedge is
then conducted by defining the corresponding strategy based on positions in
barrier options. The proposed methodology allows to construct not only first
order hedges but also higher order semi-static hedges, that can be interpreted
as asymptotic expansions of the hedging error. The convergence of these higher
order semi-static hedges to an exact hedge is shown. An illustration of the
main theoretical results is provided for i) a symmetric case, ii) a one
dimensional case, where the first order and second order hedging errors are
derived in analytic closed form. The materiality of the hedging benefit gain of
going from order one to order two by re-iterating the timing risk hedging
strategy is discussed through numerical evidences by showing that order two can
bring to more than 90% reduction of the hedging 'cost' w.r.t. order one
(depending on the specific barrier option characteristics).

Both types of questions, i.e., why and why-not provenance, have been studied
extensively. In this work, we present the first practical approach for
answering such questions for queries with negation (first-order queries). Our
approach is based on a rewriting of Datalog rules (called firing rules) that
captures successful rule derivations within the context of a Datalog query. We
extend this rewriting to support negation and to capture failed derivations
that explain missing answers. Given a (why or why-not) provenance question, we
compute an explanation, i.e., the part of the provenance that is relevant to
answer the question. We introduce optimizations that prune parts of a
provenance graph early on if we can determine that they will not be part of the
explanation for a given question. We present an implementation that runs on top

demonstrate that our approach scales to large instances and significantly

extrapolate additional characters. Consequently, we obtain a complete font
containing a number of characters sufficient for daily use. The automated
generation of Japanese fonts is in high demand because a Japanese font requires
over 1,000 characters. Unfortunately, professional typographers create most
fonts, resulting in significant financial and time investments for font
generation. The proposed method can be a great aid for font creation because
designers do not need to create the majority of the characters for a new font.
The proposed method uses strokes from given samples for font generation. The
strokes, from which we construct characters, are extracted by exploiting a
character skeleton dataset. This study makes three main contributions: a novel
method of extracting strokes from characters, which is applicable to both
standard fonts and their variations; a fully automated approach for
constructing characters; and a selection method for sample characters. We
demonstrate our proposed method by generating 2,965 characters in 47 fonts.
Objective and subjective evaluations verify that the generated characters are
similar to handmade characters.

$Ax=b$ with $b$ contaminated by a white noise, the Lanczos bidiagonalization
based LSQR method and its mathematically equivalent Conjugate Gradient (CG)
method for $A^TAx=A^Tb$ are most commonly used. They have intrinsic
regularizing effects, where the number $k$ of iterations plays the role of
regularization parameter. However, there has been no answer to the
long-standing fundamental concern by Bj\""{o}rck and Eld\'{e}n in 1979: for
which kinds of problems LSQR and CGLS can find best possible regularized
solutions? Here a best possible regularized solution means that it is at least
as accurate as the best regularized solution obtained by the truncated singular
value decomposition (TSVD) method or standard-form Tikhonov regularization. In
this paper, assuming that the singular values of $A$ are simple, we analyze the
regularization of LSQR for severely, moderately and mildly ill-posed problems.
We establish accurate estimates for the 2-norm distance between the underlying
$k$-dimensional Krylov subspace and the $k$-dimensional dominant right singular
subspace of $A$. For the first two kinds of problems, we then prove that LSQR
finds a best possible regularized solution at semi-convergence occurring at
iteration $k_0$ and that, for $k=1,2,\ldots,k_0$, (i) the $k$-step Lanczos
bidiagonalization always generates a near best rank $k$ approximation to $A$;
(ii) the $k$ Ritz values always approximate the first $k$ large singular values
in natural order; (iii) the $k$-step LSQR always captures the $k$ dominant SVD
components of $A$. For the third kind of problem, we prove that LSQR generally
cannot find a best possible regularized solution. Numerical experiments confirm
our theory.

to generic quantum environments including the three fundamental classes of
noninteracting particles: bosons, fermions and spins. In this unified
stochastic approach, the generalized stochastic Liouville equation (SLE)
formally captures the exact quantum dissipations when noise variables with
appropriate statistics for different bath models are applied. Anharmonic
effects of a non-Gaussian bath are precisely encoded in the bath multi-time
correlation functions that noise variables have to satisfy. Staring from the
SLE, we devise a family of generalized hierarchical equations by averaging out
the noise variables and expand bath multi-time correlation functions in a
complete basis of orthonormal functions. The general hiearchical equations
constitute systems of linear equations that provide numerically exact
simulations of quantum dynamics. For bosonic bath models, our general
hierarchical equation of motion reduces exactly to an extended version of
hierarchical equation of motion which allows efficient simulation for arbitrary
spectral densities and temperature regimes. Similar efficiency and exibility
can be achieved for the fermionic bath models within our formalism. The spin
bath models can be simulated with two complementary approaches in the presetn
formalism. (I) They can be viewed as an example of non-Gaussian bath models and
be directly handled with the general hierarchical equation approach given their
multi-time correlation functions. (II) Alterantively, each bath spin can be
first mapped onto a pair of fermions and be treated as fermionic environments
within the present formalism.

introduce a linear filtering technique based on spatio-spectral coupling, which

demonstrate approximately 40 times contrast enhancement in optical parametric
chirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA) and provide a foundation for scaling to

effects of the bath in dynamical calculations. We investigate the leading order
corrections to the linear response approximations for spin bath models. Two
types of spin-based environments are considered: (1) a bath of spins
discretized from a continuous spectral density and (2) a bath of physical spins
such as nuclear or electron spins. The main difference resides with how the
bath frequency and the system-bath coupling parameters are chosen to represent
an environment. When discretized from a continuous spectral density, the
system-bath coupling typically scales as $\sim 1/\sqrt{N_B}$ where $N_B$ is the
number of bath spins. This scaling suppresses the non-Gaussian characteristics
of the spin bath and justify the linear response approximations in the
thermodynamic limit. For the physical spin bath models, system-bath couplings
are directly deduced from spin-spin interactions with no reason to obey the
$1/\sqrt{N_B}$ scaling. It is not always possible to justify the linear
response approximations. Furthermore, if the spin-spin Hamiltonian and/or the
bath parameters are highly symmetrical, these additional constraints generate
non-Markovian and persistent dynamics that is beyond the linear response
treatments.

M. The ""lithium dip"" near Teff~6600 K in the distribution of log e(Li) with

deriving new triples by applying entailment rules on knowledge bases. The
entailment rules are determined by the model-theoretic semantics. Incorporating
context of an RDF triple (e.g., provenance, time, and location) into the
inferencing process requires the formal semantics to be capable of describing
the context of RDF triples also in the form of triples, or in other words, RDF
contextual triples about triples. The formal semantics should also provide the
rules that could entail new contextual triples about triples. In this paper, we
propose the first inferencing mechanism that allows context of RDF triples,
represented in the form of RDF triples about triples, to be the first-class
citizens in the model-theoretic semantics and in the logical rules. Our
inference mechanism is well-formalized with all new concepts being captured in
the model-theoretic semantics. This formal semantics also allows us to derive a
new set of entailment rules that could entail new contextual triples about
triples. To demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of the proposed
mechanism, we implement a new tool in which we transform the existing knowledge
bases to our representation of RDF triples about triples and provide the option
for this tool to compute the inferred triples for the proposed rules. We
evaluate the computation of the proposed rules on a large scale using various
real-world knowledge bases such as Bio2RDF NCBI Genes and DBpedia. The results
show that the computation of the inferred triples can be highly scalable. On
average, one billion inferred triples adds 5-6 minutes to the overall
transformation process. NCBI Genes, with 20 billion triples in total, took only
232 minutes for the transformation of 12 billion triples and added 42 minutes
for inferring 8 billion triples to the overall process.

at the forefront of current theoretical and experimental efforts in heavy-ion

collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The theory of jet quenching, a commonly used
alias for the modifications of the parton branching resulting from the
interactions with the QGP, has been significantly developed over the last
years. Within a weak coupling approach, several elementary processes that build
up the parton shower evolution, such as single gluon emissions, interference
effects between successive emissions and corrections to radiative energy loss
of massive quarks, have been addressed both at eikonal accuracy and beyond by
taking into account the Brownian motion that high-energy particles experience
when traversing a hot and dense medium. In this work, by using the setup of
single gluon emission from a color correlated quark-antiquark pair in a singlet
state ($q\bar{q}$ antenna), we calculate the in-medium gluon radiation spectrum

factorize broadening effects from the modifications of the radiation process

levitating without mechanical support, can either be laminar or turbulent,
depending on the velocity amplitude. Below a critical velocity $v_c$ that
scales as $\omega ^{1/2}$, and is temperature independent below 1 K, the flow
is laminar (potential flow). Below 0.5 K the linear drag force is caused by
ballistic phonon scattering that vanishes as T$^4$ until background damping,
measured in the empty cell, becomes dominant for T $<$ 0.1 K. Increasing the
velocity amplitude above $v_c$ leads to a transition from potential flow to
turbulence, where the large turbulent drag force varies as $(v^2 - v_c^2)$. In
a small velocity interval $\Delta v / v_c \le 3 \%$ above $v_c$, the flow is
unstable below 0.5 K, switching intermittently between both patterns. From time
series recorded at constant temperature and driving force, the lifetimes of
both phases are analyzed statistically. We observe metastable states of
potential flow which, after a mean lifetime of 25 minutes, ultimately break
down due to vorticity created by natural background radioactivity. The
lifetimes of the turbulent phases have an exponential distribution, and the
mean increases exponentially with $\Delta v^2$. We investigate the frequency at
which the vortex rings are shed from the sphere. Our results are compared with
recent data of other authors on vortex shedding by moving a laser beam through
a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we show that our observed transition to
turbulence belongs to the class of ""supertransient chaos"" where lifetimes of
the turbulent states increase faster than exponentially. Peculiar results
obtained in dilute $^3$He - $^4$He mixtures are presented in the Appendix.

the finite dimensionality of the Chow motive $h(S)$, there are at most a
countable number of decomposable integral polarized Hodge structures, arising
from the fibers of a family of smooth projective surfaces. According to the

This has the weakest high energy Compton tail ever seen from this object, so

best determination of black hole spin from disk continuum fitting. Using the
standard model of a disk with simple non-thermal Comptonisation to produce the
weak high energy tail gives a high spin black hole. However, we get a
significantly better fit by including an additional, low temperature thermal
Comptonisation component, which allows a much lower black hole spin.
Corroboration of the existence of an additional Compton component comes from
the frequency dependent hard lags seen in the rapid variability in archival
high/soft state data. These can not be explained if the continuum is a single
non-thermal Comptonisation component, but are instead consistent with a
radially stratified, multi zone Comptonisation spectrum, where the spectrum is
softer further from the black hole. A complex multi-zone Comptonisation
continuum is required to explain both spectra and timing together, and this has
an impact on the derived black hole spin.

promising approach to improve the network performance, but it also imposes a
significant challenge on backhaul. On the other hand, caching at small base
stations (SBSs) is considered as an efficient way to reduce backhaul load in
HetNets. In this paper, we jointly consider SBS caching and cooperation in a
downlink largescale HetNet. We propose two SBS cooperative transmission schemes
under random caching at SBSs with the caching distribution as a design
parameter. Using tools from stochastic geometry and adopting appropriate
integral transformations, we first derive a tractable expression for the
successful transmission probability under each scheme. Then, under each scheme,
we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing
the caching distribution, which is a challenging optimization problem with a
non-convex objective function. By exploring optimality properties and using
optimization techniques, under each scheme, we obtain a local optimal solution
in the general case and global optimal solutions in some special cases.
Compared with some existing caching designs in the literature, e.g., the most
popular caching, the i.i.d. caching and the uniform caching, the optimal random
caching under each scheme achieves better successful transmission probability
performance. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable design
insights for practical HetNets.

over ten years due to its importance in monitoring ones' activities,

main limitations are still preventing it from large-scale deployments: high
power consumption, and the lack of high-volume and diverse labeled data. In
order to reduce power consumption, existing approaches are sampling using fewer
sensors and with lower frequency, which however lead to a lower accuracy. A
common way to obtain labeled data is recording the ground truth while
collecting data, but such method cannot apply to large-scale deployment due to
its inefficiency. To address these issues, we adopt a new low-frequency
sampling manner with a hierarchical transportation mode identification
algorithm and propose an offline data labeling approach with its manual and
automatic implementations. Through a real-world large-scale experiment and
comparison with related works, our sampling manner and algorithm are proved to
consume much less energy while achieving a competitive accuracy around 85%. The
new offline data labeling approach is also validated to be efficient and
effective in providing ground truth for model training and testing.

involving three spin 0 and one spin j particle. We find that these constraints
admit a local solution for quartic 000j interaction term in the action only for

massless higher spin fields in an extended theory with a local action. We also
consider the conformal off-shell extension of the Einstein theory and show that
its perturbative expansion is the same as of the the non-local action resulting
from integrating out the trace of the graviton field from the Einstein action.
Motivated by this example, we conjecture the existence of a similar conformal
off-shell extension of a massless higher spin theory that may be related to the
above extended theory and may have the same infinite-dimensional symmetry as
the conformal higher spin theory and thus may lead to a trivial S matrix.

decay times ranging from several days to a few months, followed by a more
gradual recovery. Glitches displaying exponential relaxation with single or
multiple decay time constants are analysed in terms of a model based on the
interaction of the vortex lines with the toroidal arrangement of flux tubes in
the outer core of the neutron star. Model results agree with the observed
timescales in general. Thus, the glitch phenomenon can be used to deduce
valuable information about neutron star structure, in particular on the
interior magnetic field configuration which is unaccessible from surface
observations. One immediate conclusion is that the magnetar glitch data are
best explained with a much cooler core and therefore require that direct Urca
type fast cooling mechanisms should be effective for magnetars.

these structures have been experimentally realized. Graphyne nanoscrolls are
structures obtained by rolling up graphyne sheets into papyrus-like structures.
In this work we have investigated, through fully atomistic reactive molecular
dynamics simulations, the dynamics of nanoscroll formation for a series of
graphyne ({\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\delta} types) structures. We have also
investigated their thermal stability for a temperature range of 200-1000K. Our
results show that stable nanoscrolls can be formed for all structures
considered here. Their stability depends on a critical value of the ratio
between width and height of the graphyne sheets. Our findings also show that
these structures are structurally less stable then graphene-based nanoscrolls.
This can be explained by the graphyne higher structural porosity which results
in a decreased pi-pi stacking interactions

partition relations for both singletons and pairs. It provides analogues of the
Milner-Rado paradox for these orders instead of ordinals. For infinite, regular

weakly $\kappa$-scattered, and $\kappa$-saturated linear orders of size
$\kappa$ are closed under the partition relation $\tau \rightarrow (\varphi,

ensuring an exponentially fast attraction of adequate reference trajectories.
To achieve this goal, we make use of the relation between first-order
hyperbolic PDEs and integral delay equations leading to a decoupling of the
input-dependent dynamics and the infinite-dimensional internal one.
Furthermore, the dynamic control structure does not necessitate exact knowledge

formation in spiral galaxies. Our aim is to study relations between different
star formation tracers (stellar UV and near-IR radiation and emission from HI,
CO and cold dust) in the spiral arms of M31, to calculate stability conditions
in the galaxy disc and to draw conclusions about possible star formation
triggering mechanisms.
  Methods: We select fourteen spiral arm segments from the de-projected data
maps and compare emission distributions along the cross sections of the
segments in different datasets to each other, in order to detect spatial
offsets between young stellar populations and the star forming medium. By using
the disc stability condition as a function of perturbation wavelength and
distance from the galaxy centre we calculate the effective disc stability
parameters and the least stable wavelengths at different distances. For this we
utilise a mass distribution model of M31 with four disc components (old and
young stellar discs, cold and warm gaseous discs) embedded within the external
potential of the bulge, the stellar halo and the dark matter halo. Each
component is considered to have a realistic finite thickness.
  Results: No systematic offsets between the observed UV and CO/far-IR emission
across the spiral segments are detected. The calculated effective stability
parameter has a minimal value Q_{eff} ~ 1.8 at galactocentric distances 12 - 13
kpc. The least stable wavelengths are rather long, with the minimal values
starting from ~ 3 kpc at distances R > 11 kpc.
  Conclusions: The classical density wave theory is not a realistic explanation
for the spiral structure of M31. Instead, external causes should be considered,
e.g. interactions with massive gas clouds or dwarf companions of M31.

changing viewing geometry for reasons not fully understood. It is often
observed to redden (increasing spectral slope) with increasing solar phase

Martian surface by the Viking 1 lander, was reddening observed up to a certain
phase angle with bluing beyond, making the reflectance ratio as a function of
phase angle shaped like an arch. However, in laboratory experiments this
arch-shape is frequently encountered. To investigate this, we measured the
bidirectional reflectance of particulate samples of several common rock types
in the 400-1000 nm wavelength range and performed ray-tracing simulations. We
confirm the occurrence of the arch for surfaces that are forward scattering,
i.e. are composed of semi-transparent particles and are smooth on the scale of
the particles, and for which the reflectance increases from the lower to the
higher wavelength in the reflectance ratio. The arch shape is reproduced by the
simulations, which assume a smooth surface. However, surface roughness on the
scale of the particles, such as the Hapke and van Horn (1963) fairy castles
that can spontaneously form when sprinkling a fine powder, leads to monotonic
reddening. A further consequence of this form of microscopic roughness (being
indistinct without the use of a microscope) is a flattening of the disk
function at visible wavelengths, i.e. Lommel-Seeliger-type scattering. The
experiments further reveal monotonic reddening for reflectance ratios at
near-IR wavelengths. The simulations fail to reproduce this particular
reddening, and we suspect that it results from roughness on the surface of the
particles. Given that the regolith of atmosphereless solar system bodies is

compressed sensing, sparse superposition codes, and code division multiple

this problem using the replica method from statistical physics. Here we put
these considerations on a firm rigorous basis. First, we show, using a
Guerra-Toninelli type interpolation, that the replica formula yields an upper
bound to the exact mutual information. Secondly, for many relevant practical
cases, we present a converse lower bound via a method that uses spatial
coupling, state evolution analysis and the I-MMSE theorem. This yields a single
letter formula for the mutual information and the minimal-mean-square error for
random Gaussian linear estimation of all discrete bounded signals. In addition,
we prove that the low complexity approximate message-passing algorithm is
optimal outside of the so-called hard phase, in the sense that it
asymptotically reaches the minimal-mean-square error. In this work spatial
coupling is used primarily as a proof technique. However our results also prove
two important features of spatially coupled noisy linear random Gaussian
estimation. First there is no algorithmically hard phase. This means that for
such systems approximate message-passing always reaches the minimal-mean-square
error. Secondly, in a proper limit the mutual information associated to such
systems is the same as the one of uncoupled linear random Gaussian estimation.

quantized anisotropic models has remained largely unexplored. In particular,
robustness of bounce and the validity of effective dynamics have so far not
been established. Our analysis fills these gaps for the case of vacuum
Bianchi-I spacetime. To efficiently solve the quantum Hamiltonian constraint we
perform an implementation of the Cactus framework which is conventionally used
for applications in numerical relativity. Using high performance computing,
numerical simulations for a large number of initial states with a wide variety
of fluctuations are performed. Big bang singularity is found to be replaced by
anisotropic bounces for all the cases. We find that for initial states which
are sharply peaked at the late times in the classical regime and bounce at a
mean volume much greater than the Planck volume, effective dynamics is an
excellent approximation to the underlying quantum dynamics. Departures of the
effective dynamics from the quantum evolution appear for the states probing
deep Planck volumes. A detailed analysis of the behavior of this departure
reveals a non-monotonic and subtle dependence on fluctuations of the initial
states. We find that effective dynamics in almost all of the cases
underestimates the volume and hence overestimates the curvature at the bounce,
a result in synergy with earlier findings in isotropic case. The expansion and
shear scalars are found to be bounded throughout the evolution.

such spectrum changes should take place. These particular changes in the

it with a regular spherically symmetric distribution of matters of which

explicitly expressed by function values at a series of single points. In
applying the solution method, the nonlinear initial boundary value problems are
first spatially discretized into a nonlinear initial value problem by combining

A novel high order step by step time integrating approach is then developed for

two fields compete, i.e. one tends to synchronize oscillators while the other
one desynchronizes them. Here we identify normal branches which bifurcate from
the incoherent state in a usual way, and anomalous branches, appearance of
which cannot be described as a bifurcation. Furthermore, hybrid branches
combining properties of both are described. In the situations where no stable
traveling wave exists, modulated quasiperiodic in time dynamics is observed.
Our results indicate that a competition between two coupling channels can lead
to a complex system behavior, providing a potential generalized framework for
understanding of complex phenomena in natural oscillatory systems.

conditions. Slow growth resulted in quasi-crystalline yellowish whiskers, while
high concentration of precursors led to fast formation of the quasi-amorphous
aggregates. The elemental constitution of object under study was determined
with the help of Comebax-INCA set-up, and was then proved by chemical analysis.
The ratio of elements was close to Ag6Si2O7, and depended a little whether the
sample was taken from the sediments of reaction or from dried residue of a
liquid medium. The experiments in Raman technique revile several
well-resolvable bands in whisker-like samples, but only few of them were able
to detect in quasi-amorphous material. In the last case the bands were broader,
but the positions of weak broad bands were close to the positions of
corresponding bands in whiskers. We can suggest, that the bands, common in two
former cases, are due to oscillation in bepyramidal molecules of Ag6Si2O7, and
the bands, seen only at whiskers, are due to long-rang order. The very special
peculiarity was observed under chemical test with hydrochloric acid. The white
flakes sedimentation appeared after addition of NaCl but do not appeared when
HCl was added. This result can be explained if to assume the existence of

the solution of moisture diffusion problems in porous materials for improving
stability conditions. Nevertheless, these schemes require important
sub-iterations when treating non-linear problems. To overcome this
disadvantage, this paper explores the use of improved explicit schemes, such as
Dufort-Frankel, Crank-Nicolson and hyperbolisation approaches. A first case
study has been considered with the hypothesis of linear transfer. The
Dufort-Frankel, Crank-Nicolson and hyperbolisation schemes were compared to the
classical Euler explicit scheme and to a reference solution. Results have shown
that the hyperbolisation scheme has a stability condition higher than the
standard Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The error of this schemes
depends on the parameter \tau representing the hyperbolicity magnitude added
into the equation. The Dufort-Frankel scheme has the advantages of being
unconditionally stable and is preferable for non-linear transfer, which is the
second case study. Results have shown the error is proportional to O(\Delta t).
A modified Crank-Nicolson scheme has been proposed in order to avoid
sub-iterations to treat the non-linearities at each time step. The main
advantages of the Dufort-Frankel scheme are (i) to be twice faster than the
Crank-Nicolson approach; (ii) to compute explicitly the solution at each time
step; (iii) to be unconditionally stable and (iv) easier to parallelise on
high-performance computer systems. Although the approach is unconditionally
stable, the choice of the time discretisation $\Delta t$ remains an important
issue to accurately represent the physical phenomena.

summatory results for these constants $\gamma_k(a)$ in terms of fundamental
mathematical constants such as the Catalan constant, and further relate them to
products of rational functions of prime numbers. We provide examples of
infinite series of differences of Stieltjes constants evaluating as volumes in
hyperbolic $3$-space. We present a new series representation for the difference
of the first Stieltjes constant at rational arguments. We obtain expressions
for $\zeta(1/2)L_{-p}(1/2)$, where for primes $p>7$, $L_{-p}(s)$ are certain
$L$-series, and remarkably tight bounds for the value $\zeta(1/2)$,
$\zeta(s)=\zeta(s,1)$ being the Riemann zeta function.

  incunabulum: 'Der Heiligen Leben' (1488)",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper provides the first thorough documentation of a high quality
digitization process applied to an early printed book from the incunabulum
period (1450-1500). The entire OCR related workflow including preprocessing,
layout analysis and text recognition is illustrated in detail using the example
of 'Der Heiligen Leben', printed in Nuremberg in 1488. For each step the
required time expenditure was recorded. The character recognition yielded
excellent results both on character (97.57%) and word (92.19%) level.
Furthermore, a comparison of a highly automated (LAREX) and a manual (Aletheia)
method for layout analysis was performed. By considerably automating the
segmentation the required human effort was reduced significantly from over 100
hours to less than six hours, resulting in only a slight drop in OCR accuracy.
Realistic estimates for the human effort necessary for full text extraction
from incunabula can be derived from this study. The printed pages of the
complete work together with the OCR result is available online ready to be
inspected and downloaded.

than scalar field. This detector has two energy states and produces Larmor
radiation when there is no energy gap between them. This setup indicates that
Larmor radiation and Unruh radiation are two counterparts of the same
phenomenon. Larmor radiation is observed in the inertial frame, while Unruh
radiation is observed in an accelerated frame. The accelerated observer sees
that his detector absorbed a particle inside its own accelerated horizon, while
the Larmor radiation is the companion particle which leaves the accelerated
observer's horizon. Since the detection is based on the electromagnetic field,
this type of detector is much closer to the real world than a standard
Unruh-DeWitt detector which is coupled to a scalar field.

considerably. Quantum many body systems out of equilibrium often manifest
behavior, different from the one predicted by standard statistical mechanics
and thermodynamics in equilibrium. Since the dynamics of a many body quantum
system typically involve many excited eigenstates, with a non-thermal
distribution, the time evolution of such a system provides an unique way for
investigation of non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. Last decade
such new subjects like quantum quenches, thermalization, pre-thermalization,
equilibration, generalized Gibbs ensemble, etc. are among the most attractive
topics of investigation in modern quantum physics. One of the most interesting
themes in the study of dynamics of quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium
is connected with the recently proposed important concept of dynamical quantum
phase transitions. During the last few years a great progress has been achieved
in studying of those singularities in the time dependence of characteristics of
quantum mechanical systems, in particular, in understanding how the quantum
critical points of equilibrium thermodynamics affect their dynamical
properties. Dynamical quantum phase transitions reveal universality, scaling,
connection to the topology, and many other interesting features. Here we review
the recent achievements of this quickly developing part of low temperature
quantum physics. The study of dynamical quantum phase transitions is especially
important in context of their connection to the problem of the modern theory of
quantum information, where namely non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum
system plays the major role.

to formulate acidic food products, as it can act as both bio-functional and
technofunctional constituent. Typically, acetic acid is used to disperse
chitosan in aqueous media, but the use of this acid is limited in food
formulations due to its flavor. In this study, chitosan was firstly dispersed
(0.1% m/V) in lactic acid aqueous solutions (pH 3.0, 3.5 or 4.0), and then
evaluated regarding its thickener and emulsion stabilizer properties. O/W
emulsions were prepared and characterized in terms of rheological properties,
droplets average diameters and droplets $\zeta$-potential. Emulsions containing
chitosan were 3 times more viscous than controls without chitosan, and
presented storage modulus ($G'$) higher than loss modulus ($G''$). Furthermore,
they displayed two different populations of droplets (average diameters of 44
and 365 nm) and positive $\zeta$-potential values (+50 mV). Droplets average
diameters and $\zeta$-potential did not present significant changes ($p$ >
0.05) after storage at 25 $^{\circ}$C during 7 days. This study showed that i)
food organic acids other than acetic acid can be used to disperse chitosan for
technological purposes, and ii) chitosan dispersed at very low concentrations
(0.1% m/V) had relevant effects on rheological and physicochemical aspects of
food-grade emulsions.
