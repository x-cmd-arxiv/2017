forest dynamics, and range contraction. Here we study the climatic drivers of
Picea crassifolia Kom., an endemic to northwest China where climate has
significantly warmed. Picea crassifolia was sampled from its lower
distributional margin to its upper distributional margin on the Helan Mountains
to test the hypothesis that 1) growth at the upper limit is limited by cool
temperatures and 2) is limited by drought at its lower limit. We found that
trees at the lower distributional margin have experienced a higher rate of
stem-growth cessation events since 2001 compared to trees at other elevations.
While all populations have a similar climatic sensitivity, stem-growth
cessation events in trees at lower distributional margin appear to be driven by
low precipitation in June as the monsoon begins to deliver moisture to the
region. Evidence indicates that mid-summer (July) vapor pressure deficit (VPD)
exacerbates the frequency of these events. These data and our analysis makes it
evident that an increase in severity and frequency of drought early in the
monsoon season could increase the frequency and severity of stem-growth
cessation in Picea crassifolia trees at lower elevations. Increases in VPD and
warming would likely exacerbate the growth stress of this species on Helan
Mountain. Hypothetically, if the combinations of low moisture and increased VPD
stress becomes more common, the mortality rate of lower distributional margin
trees could increase, especially of those that are already experiencing events
of temporary growth cessation.

making use of the recently developed semi-inclusive jet functions within Soft
Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). In addition, single logarithms of the jet

obtained within the framework of SCET with Glauber gluons that describe the

astrophysics and spectroscopic studies in nuclear physics. Usually, these

deuteron-target interactions. Within such a framework the importance of the
deuteron D-state in low-energy reactions is normally associated with spin
observables and tensor polarization effects - with very minimal influence on
differential cross sections. In contrast, recent work that includes the
inherent nonlocality of the nucleon optical model potentials in the
Johnson-Tandy adiabatic-model description of the (d,p) transition amplitude,
which accounts for deuteron break-up effects, shows sensitivity of the reaction
to the large n-p relative momentum content of the deuteron wave function. The
dominance of the deuteron D-state component at such high momenta leads to
significant sensitivity of calculated (d,p) cross sections and deduced
spectroscopic factors to the choice of deuteron wave function [Phys. Rev. Lett.

model of the (d,p) transfer reaction generalized to include the deuteron
D-state in the presence of nonlocal nucleon-target interactions. We present
exact calculations in this model and compare these to approximate
(leading-order) solutions. The latter, approximate solutions can be interpreted
in terms of local optical potentials, but evaluated at a shifted value of the
energy in the nucleon-target system. This energy shift is increased when
including the D-state contribution. We also study the expected dependence of
the D-state effects on the separation energy and orbital angular momentum of
the transferred nucleon. Their influence on the spectroscopic information
extracted from (d,p) reactions is quantified for a particular case of
astrophysical significance.

in the visible sector entropy density that dilute both particle asymmetries and
the number density of frozen-out states. In fact, late time entropy jumps are
usually required in models of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, which typically
produces an initial particle-antiparticle asymmetry that is much too large. An
important consequence of late time dilution, is that a smaller dark matter
annihilation cross section is needed to obtain the observed dark matter relic
density. For cosmologies with high scale baryogenesis, followed by
radiation-dominated dark matter freeze-out, we show that the perturbative
unitarity mass bound on thermal relic dark matter is relaxed to $10^{10}$ GeV.
We proceed to study superheavy asymmetric dark matter models, made possible by
a sizable entropy injection after dark matter freeze-out, and identify how the
Affleck-Dine mechanism would generate the baryon and dark asymmetries.

statistical mechanics separates the two naturally by identifying the structural

take into account a degeneration of Hassett spaces parametrizing rational

with a linked dataset of recovery locations which, due to partial recovery, is
a relatively small subset of the set of theft locations. For an investigator
seeking to understand the behavior of car thefts and recoveries in the region,
several questions are addressed. Viewing the set of theft locations as a point
pattern, can we propose useful models to explain the pattern? What types of
predictive models can be built to learn about recovery location given theft
location? Can the dependence between theft locations and recovery locations be
formalized? Can the flow between theft sites and recovery sites be captured?
Origin-destination modeling offers a natural framework for such problems.
However, here the data is not for areal units but rather is a pair of point
patterns, with the recovery point pattern only partially observed. We offer
modeling approaches for investigating the questions above and apply the
approaches to two datasets. One is small from the state of Neza in Mexico with

with the Higgs mass constraint, sets a lower bound on the stops masses of about
25 TeV. The LUX constraints can be satisfied for larger $\tan\beta$ if the

space is strongly constrained by recent LHC results of the Higgs boson

Higgs bosons to be lighter than about 400 GeV and $\tan\beta$ below about 8.
This implies a lower bound on the stop masses of about 1.5 TeV. This small
corner of the parameter space will be probed in the near future by the direct
detection experiments, the LHC Higgs searches and precision Higgs coupling
measurements. The recent LUX constraints improved also the lower mass limit on

of multiple samples of functional data. To this end, the non-parametric
combination methodology of Pesarin and Salmaso (2010) is used to combine all
the pairwise comparisons between samples into a global test. Different
combining functions and permutation strategies are reviewed and analyzed in
detail. The resulting test allows to make inference on the equality of the
covariance operators of multiple groups and, if there is evidence to reject the
null hypothesis, to identify the pairs of groups having different covariances.
It is shown that, for some combining functions, step-down adjusting procedures
are available to control for the multiple testing problem in this setting. The
empirical power of this new test is then explored via simulations and compared
with those of existing alternative approaches in different scenarios. Finally,
the proposed methodology is applied to data from wheel running activity
experiments, that used selective breeding to study the evolution of locomotor

sample of merging galaxy clusters. Using much more comprehensive data on the

measurements. Correcting these errors relaxes the upper limit on $\sigma_{\rm

relating offsets to cross sections in a simple solid body scattering model.
Furthermore, many clusters in the sample violate the assumptions behind this

Although this particular sample does not tightly constrain self-interacting
dark matter models when analyzed this way, we discuss how merger ensembles may
be used more effectively in the future. We conclude that errors inherent in

combination of Motzkin paths. The weight of such path contributions can be
controlled by a deformation parameter t. As a function of the latter these
models, beside the formation of domain wall structures, exhibit a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for t=1 and gapped Haldane
topological orders with constant decay of the string order parameters for t <
1. By means of numerical calculations we show that the topological properties
of the Haldane phases depend on the spin value. This allows to classify
different kinds of hidden antiferromagnetic Haldane gapped regimes associated
to nontrivial features like symmetry-protected topological order. Our results
from one side allow to clarify the physical properties of Motzkin
frustration-free chains and from the other suggest them as a new interesting
and paradigmatic class of local spin Hamiltonians.

such as power systems, the Internet of Things or intelligent transportation
systems, is that traditional distributed optimal control methods do not scale
gracefully, neither in controller synthesis nor in controller implementation,
to systems composed of millions, billions or even trillions of interacting
subsystems. This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by
leveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller
synthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions
of separability for control objective functions and system constraints such
that the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a
distributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel
subproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity)
constraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local
models and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the
convexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a
consequence, the resulting synthesis methods have $O(1)$ complexity relative to
the size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control
problems of interest, such as (localized) LQR and LQG, $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal
control with joint actuator and sensor regularization, and (localized) mixed
$\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{L}_1$ optimal control problems, satisfy these notions
of separability, and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance,
actuator and sensing density, and average versus worst-case performance for a
large-scale power inspired system.

memoryless communication network through which a server is connected to
multiple users, each equipped with a local isolated cache of certain size that
can be used to store part of the library. Each user will ask for one of the
files in the library, which needs to be delivered by the server through the
intermediate communication network. The objective is to design the cache
placement (without prior knowledge of users' future requests) and the delivery
phase in order to minimize the (normalized) delivery delay. We assume that the
delivery phase consists of two steps: (1) generation of a set of multicast
messages at the server, one for each subset of users, and (2) delivery of the
multicast messages to the users.
  In this setting, we show that there exists a universal scheme for cache
placement and multicast message generation, which is independent of the
underlying communication network between the server and the users, and achieves
the optimal delivery delay to within a constant factor for all memoryless
networks. We prove this result, even though the capacity region of the
underlying communication network is not known, even approximately. This result
demonstrates that in the aforementioned setting, a separation between caching
and multicast message generation on one hand, and delivering the multicast
messages to the users on the other hand is approximately optimal. This result
has the important practical implication that the prefetching can be done
independent of network structure in the upcoming delivery phase.

In the ""traditional"" implementation, approximate solutions, valid in different

This has the advantage that one does not need to explicitly solve the
asymptotic equations to do the matching, which can be quite impossible for some
problems. In addition, it allows matching to proceed in certain wave situations
where the traditional approach fails because the time behaviors differ (e.g.,
one of the expansions does not include dissipation). On the other hand, this

standard matching. In fact, this is not even its aim, which to produce the

odds with the predictions of the kinematic model for any of the plausible
bright spectral lines in this band, raising the question of their
identification. Here we address this issue by taking into account time delays
of the emission coming from the receding regions of the jets relative to that
from the approaching ones, which cause a substantial phase shift and distortion
of the predicted line positions for the extended ($ \sim 10^{17}$ cm) emission
compared to the X-ray and optical lines observed from the central source

\sim6\times10^{16}$ cm along the jet. This supports the idea that intensive
reheating of the jets up to temperatures $ \gtrsim10 $ keV takes place at these

interaction with the surrounding medium, which might cause collisions between

irrespective of their specific modal structure, can be transformed to any
output channel arrangement. Thus, our method enables full access to all of the

evidence for a strong stellar mass-size evolution of galaxies within the last
10 Gyr. The likely progenitors of today's most massive galaxies are remarkably
small, disky, passive and have already assembled much of their stellar mass at
redshift z=2. An in-depth analysis of these objects, however, is currently not
feasible due to the lack of high-quality, spatially-resolved photometric and
spectroscopic data. In this paper, we present a sample of nearby compact
elliptical galaxies (CEGs), which bear resemblance to the massive and quiescent
galaxy population at earlier times. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and wide-field
integral field unit (IFU) data have been obtained, and are used to constrain
orbit-based dynamical models and stellar population synthesis (SPS) fits, to
unravel their structural and dynamical properties. We first show that our
galaxies are outliers in the present-day stellar mass-size relation. They are,
however, consistent with the mass-size relation of compact, massive and
quiescent galaxies at redshift z=2. The compact sizes of our nearby galaxies
imply high central stellar mass surface densities, which are also in agreement
with the massive galaxy population at higher redshift, hinting at strong
dissipational processes during their formation. Corroborating evidence for a
largely passive evolution within the last 10 Gyr is provided by their orbital
distribution as well as their stellar populations, which are difficult to
reconcile with a very active (major) merging history. This all supports that we
can use nearby CEGs as local analogues of the high-redshift, massive and
quiescent galaxy population, thus providing additional constraints for models
of galaxy formation and evolution.

emission observations carried out with NOEMA and the SMA. The
HNC(1--0)/HCN(1--0) line ratio in SDP.9 suggests the presence of
photon-dominated regions, as it happens to most local (U)LIRGs. The CO, HCN and
HCO$^+$ SLEDs of SDP.9 are compatible to those found for many local, infrared
(IR) bright galaxies, indicating that the molecular gas in local and
high-redshift dusty starbursts can have similar excitation conditions. We
obtain that the correlation between total IR ($L_{\rm IR}$) and dense line
($L_{\rm dense}$) luminosity in SDP.9 and SDP.11 and local star-forming
galaxies can be represented by a single relation. The scatter of the $L_{\rm

molecular gas tracer observations for a homogeneous sample of high-redshift

lie at the center of an expanding dust cloud and the variable obscuration of
the companion as the SN remnant (SNR) expands will both unambiguously mark the
companion and allow the measurement of the dust content through absorption
rather than emission for decades after the explosion. However, sufficiently hot
and luminous companions can suppress dust formation by rapidly photo-ionizing
the condensible species in the ejecta. This provides a means of reconciling the
Type IIb SNe Cas A, which lacks a luminous companion and formed a significant
amount of dust (Md > 0.1 Msun), with the Type IIb SNe 1993J and 2011dh, both of

durations using a Bayesian photometry-fitting technique that accounts for both
stellar and dust emission from the UV through far IR. By comparing these
quantities to intracluster medium (ICM) cooling times and free-fall times
derived from X-ray observations and lensing estimates of the cluster mass
distribution, we discover a tight relationship between the BCG SFR and the ICM
cooling time to free-fall time ratio, $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$, with an upper limit on
the intrinsic scatter of 0.15 dex. Furthermore, starburst durations may
correlate with ICM cooling times at a radius of $0.025R_{500}$, and the two
quantities converge upon reaching the Gyr regime. Our results provide a direct
observational link between the thermodynamical state of the ICM and the
intensity and duration of BCG star formation activity, and appear consistent
with a scenario where active galactic nuclei (AGN) induce condensation of
thermally unstable ICM overdensities that fuel long-duration ($>$ 1 Gyr) BCG
starbursts. This scenario can explain (a) how gas with a low cooling time is
depleted without causing a cooling flow and (b) the scaling relationship
between SFR and $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$. We also find that the scaling relation
between SFR and dust mass in BCGs with SFRs $<100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is
similar to star-forming field galaxies; BCGs with large ($>100$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$) SFRs have dust masses comparable to extreme starbursts.

  We find a high $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\geq0.6$) within 5~$R_{\rm e}$ in most of our

is largely devoid of gas-rich major mergers. However, around log $(M_*/M_\odot)
\sim 11$, there is a wide range of $f_{\rm DM}$ which may be challenging to
explain with any single cosmological model. We find tentative evidence that
lenticulars (S0s), unlike ellipticals, have mass distributions that are similar
to spiral galaxies, with decreasing $f_{\rm DM}$ within 5~$R_{\rm e}$ as galaxy
luminosity increases. However, we do not find any difference between the
$\left< \rho_{\rm DM} \right>$ of S0s and ellipticals in our sample, despite
the differences in their stellar populations. We have also used $\left<
\rho_{\rm DM} \right>$ to infer the epoch of halo assembly ($z{\sim}2-4$). By
comparing the age of their central stars with the inferred epoch of halo

with new decoherence mechanisms introduced by the powder fabrication. Modeling
of the coherence decay shows that paramagnetic materials such as
Er$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_3$ that have highly anisotropic interactions with an applied
magnetic field can still exhibit long coherence lifetimes and relatively simple
decay shapes even for a powder of randomly oriented particles. We find that
coherence properties degrade rapidly from mechanical treatment when grinding

Brownian-particles in a binary mixture close to the critical point of the
demixing transition. The two beads are trapped by two optical tweezers whose
distance is periodically modulated. We notice that the motion synchronization
of the two beads appears when the critical temperature is approached. In

displacements of the two beads are uncorrelated. Small changes in temperature
can radically change the global dynamics of the system. We show that the
synchronisation is induced by the critical Casimir forces. Finally, we present
the measure of the energy transfers inside the system produced by the critical

slowed down. The experimental findings are compared to the solution of the heat

machines can replicate ""human-like"" gestures by connecting a bounded set of
salient points in the motion trajectory. Those inflection points were
hypothesized to also display cognitive saliency. The purpose of this paper is
to validate that claim using electroencephalography (EEG). That is, this paper
attempts to find neural signatures of gestures (also referred as placeholders)
in human cognition, which facilitate the understanding, learning and repetition
of gestures. Further, it is discussed whether there is a direct mapping between
the placeholders and kinematic salient points in the gesture trajectories.
These are expressed as relationships between inflection points in the gestures'
trajectories with oscillatory mu rhythms (8-12 Hz) in the EEG. This is achieved
by correlating fluctuations in mu power during gesture observation with salient
motion points found for each gesture. Peaks in the EEG signal at central
electrodes (motor cortex) and occipital electrodes (visual cortex) were used to
isolate the salient events within each gesture. We found that a linear model
predicting mu peaks from motion inflections fits the data well. Increases in
EEG power were detected 380 and 500ms after inflection points at occipital and
central electrodes, respectively. These results suggest that coordinated
activity in visual and motor cortices is sensitive to motion trajectories
during gesture observation, and it is consistent with the proposal that
inflection points operate as placeholders in gesture recognition.

defined as the difference between quantum mutual information and classical
correlation in a bipartite system. Procedures are available for analytical
calculation of discord when one of the parties is a qubit with dimension two
and measurements made on it to get that one-way discord. We extend now to
systems when both parties are of larger dimension, of interest to qudit-quDit
with d, D > 2 or spin chains of spins > 1/2. While recognizing that no
universal scheme is feasible, applicable to all density matrices, nevertheless
a procedure similar to that for d=2 that works for many mixed-state density
matrices remains of interest as shown by recent such applications. We focus on
this method that uses unitary operations to describe measurements, reducing
them to a compact form so as to minimize the number of variables needed for
extremizing the classical correlation, often the most difficult part of the
discord calculation. Results are boiled down to a simple recipe for that
extremization; for some classes of density matrices, the procedure even gives
trivially the final value of the classical correlation without that
extremization. A qutrit-qutrit (d=D=3) system is discussed in detail with
specific applications to density matrices for whom other calculations involved
difficult numerics. Special attention is given to the so-called X-states and
Werner and isotropic states when the calculations become particularly simple.
An appendix discusses an independent but related question of the systematics of
X-states of arbitrary dimension. It forms a second, separate, part of this
paper, extending our previous group-theoretic considerations of systematics for
qubits now to higher d.

been seen only a few times or never before. Recognizing such gestures involves
one shot gesture learning. While most research has focused on the recognition
of the gestures itself, recently new approaches were proposed to deal with
gesture perception and production as part of the same problem. The framework
presented in this work focuses on learning the process that leads to gesture
generation, rather than mining the gesture's associated features. This is
achieved using kinematic, cognitive and biomechanic characteristics of human
interaction. These factors enable the artificial production of realistic
gesture samples originated from a single observation. The generated samples are
then used as training sets for different state-of-the-art classifiers.
Performance is obtained first, by observing the machines' gesture recognition
percentages. Then, performance is computed by the human recognition from
gestures performed by robots. Based on these two scenarios, a composite new
metric of coherency is proposed relating to the amount of agreement between
these two conditions. Experimental results provide an average recognition
performance of 89.2% for the trained classifiers and 92.5% for the
participants. Coherency in recognition was determined at 93.6%. While this new
metric is not directly comparable to raw accuracy or other pure
performance-based standard metrics, it provides a quantifier for validating how
realistic the machine generated samples are and how accurate the resulting
mimicry is.

significantly fainter than that of a star formation rate-weighted field galaxy
sample over the same redshift range, indicating LGRBs are not unbiasedly
tracing the star formation rate. Morphologi- cally, the sample of LGRB hosts
are dominated by spiral-like or irregular galaxies. We find evidence for
evolution of the population of LGRB hosts towards lower-luminosity, higher
concentrated hosts at lower redshifts. Their half-light radii are consistent
with other LGRB host samples where measurements were made on rest-frame UV
obser- vations. In agreement with recent work, we find their 80 per cent
enclosed flux radii distribution to be more extended than previously thought,
making them intermedi- ate between core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and
super-luminous supernova (SLSN) hosts. The galactocentric projected-offset
distribution confirms LGRBs as centrally concentrated, much more so than CCSNe
and similar to SLSNe. LGRBs are strongly biased towards the brighter regions in
their host light distributions, regardless of their offset. We find a
correlation between the luminosity of the LGRB explosion site and the intrinsic
column density, N_H , towards the burst.

human-surrounded environments while achieving sophisticated locomotion and
manipulation tasks. To accomplish these tasks, roboticists unremittingly seek
for advanced methods that generate whole-body coordination behaviors and
meanwhile fulfill various planning and control objectives. Undoubtedly, these
goals pose fundamental challenges to the robotics and control community. To
take an incremental step towards reducing the performance gap between
theoretical foundations and real implementations, we present a planning and
control framework for the humanoid, especially legged robots, for achieving
high performance and generating agile motions. A particular concentration is on
the robust, optimal and real-time performance. This framework constitutes three
hierarchical layers: First, we present a robust optimal phase-space planning
framework for dynamic legged locomotion over rough terrain. This framework is a
hybrid motion planner incorporating a series of pivotal components. Second, we
take a step toward formally synthesizing high-level reactive planners for
whole-body locomotion in constrained environments. We formulate a two-player
temporal logic game between the contact planner and its possibly-adversarial
environment. Third, we propose a distributed control architecture for the
latency-prone humanoid robotic systems. A central experimental phenomenon is
observed that the stability of high impedance distributed controllers is highly
sensitive to damping feedback delay but much less to stiffness feedback delay.
We pursue a detailed analysis of the distributed controllers where damping
feedback effort is executed in proximity to the control plant, and stiffness
feedback effort is implemented in a latency-prone centralized control process.

baryons. In particular, the central region of the dark matter halo in the
hydrodynamic simulation is dominated by regular, short-axis tube orbits, in
contrast to the chaotic, box and thin orbits dominant in the $N$-body run. This
leads to a more spherical dark matter halo in the hydrodynamic run compared to
a prolate one as commonly seen in the $N$-body simulations. Furthermore, by
using a kernel based density estimator, we compare the coarse-grained
phase-space densities of dark matter haloes in both simulations and find that
it is lower by $\sim0.5$ dex in the hydrodynamic run due to changes in the
angular momentum distribution, which indicates that the baryonic process that
affects the dark matter is irreversible. Our results imply that baryons play an
important role in determining the shape, kinematics and phase-space density of
dark matter haloes in galaxies.

that the degree of every vertex is $a$ or $b$. The {\it weakly semiregular
number} of a graph $G$, denoted by $wr(G)$, is the minimum number of subsets
into which the edge set of $G$ can be partitioned so that the subgraph induced
by each subset is a weakly semiregular graph. We present a polynomial time
algorithm to determine whether the weakly semiregular number of a given tree is
two. On the other hand, we show that determining whether $ wr(G) = 2 $ for a
given bipartite graph $ G $ with at most three numbers in its degree set is
{\bf NP}-complete. Among other results, for every tree $T$, we show that
$wr(T)\leq 2\log_2 \Delta(T) + \mathcal{O}(1)$, where $\Delta(T)$ denotes the
maximum degree of $T$. In the second part of the work, we consider the
representation number. A graph $G$ has a {\it representation modulo $r$} if
there exists an injective map $\ell: V (G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_r$ such that
vertices $v$ and $u$ are adjacent if and only if $|\ell(u) -\ell(v)|$ is
relatively prime to $r$. The {\it representation number}, denoted by $rep(G)$,
is the smallest $r$ such that $G$ has a representation modulo $r$. Narayan and
Urick conjectured that the determination of $rep (G)$ for an arbitrary graph
$G$ is a difficult problem \cite{narayan2007representations}. In this work, we
confirm this conjecture and show that if $\mathbf{NP\neq P}$, then for any
$\epsilon >0$, there is no polynomial time
$(1-\epsilon)\frac{n}{2}$-approximation algorithm for the computation of
representation number of regular graphs with $n$ vertices.

approximating the whole Pareto-optimal front. Nevertheless, rather than the
whole front, which demands for too many points (especially in a
high-dimensional space), the decision maker might only interest in a partial
region, called the region of interest. In this case, solutions outside this
region can be noisy to the decision making procedure. Even worse, there is no
guarantee that we can find the preferred solutions when tackling problems with
complicated properties or a large number of objectives. In this paper, we
develop a systematic way to incorporate the decision maker's preference
information into the decomposition-based evolutionary multi-objective
optimization methods. Generally speaking, our basic idea is a non-uniform
mapping scheme by which the originally uniformly distributed reference points
on a canonical simplex can be mapped to the new positions close to the
aspiration level vector specified by the decision maker. By these means, we are
able to steer the search process towards the region of interest either directly
or in an interactive manner and also handle a large number of objectives. In
the meanwhile, the boundary solutions can be approximated given the decision
maker's requirements. Furthermore, the extent of the region of the interest is
intuitively understandable and controllable in a closed form. Extensive
experiments, both proof-of-principle and on a variety of problems with 3 to 10
objectives, fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for
approximating the preferred solutions in the region of interest.

optically bright or dark. Dark excitons involve nominally spin-forbidden
optical transitions with zero in-plane transition dipole moment, making their
detection with conventional far-field optical techniques challenging. Here, we
introduce a new method for probing the optical properties of two-dimensional
(2D) materials via near-field coupling to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs),
which selectively enhances optical transitions with dipole moments normal to
the 2D plane. We utilize this method to directly detect dark excitons in
monolayer TMDs. When a WSe2 monolayer is placed on top of a single-crystal
silver film, its emission into near-field-coupled SPPs displays new spectral
features whose energies and dipole orientations are consistent with dark
neutral and charged excitons. The SPP-based near-field spectroscopy
significantly enhances experimental capabilities for probing and manipulating
exciton dynamics of atomically thin materials.

expected to photoevaporate and photoionize the circumstellar disks around

quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless
for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically
affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the
problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult
problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches
attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem.
In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single
image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good
prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative
performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade
the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and
classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be
indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator.
This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by
using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks
(GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual
quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a
novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional
General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and
also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments
evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method
outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in

question. Moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting
parameter $\delta_{\rm ov}$ of the convective core is not fixed for the stars
with an approximatelly equal mass. Thus the MSTO of star clusters may be
affected by the overshooting of the convective core (OVCC). We calculated the
effects of the OVCC with different $\delta_{\rm ov}$ on the MSTO of young- and
intermediate-age star clusters. \textbf{If $\delta_{\rm ov}$ varies between
stars in a cluster,} the observed eMSTOs of young- and intermediate-age star
clusters can be explained well by the effects. The equivalent age spreads of
MSTO caused by the OVCC are related to the age of star clusters and are in good
agreement with observed results of many clusters. Moreover, the observed eMSTOs
of NGC 1856 are reproduced by the coeval populations with different
$\delta_{\rm ov}$. The eMSTOs of star clusters may be relevant to the effects
of the OVCC. The effects of the OVCC \textbf{are similar to that of rotation in
some respects. But the effects cannot result in a significant split of main
sequence of young star clusters at $m_{U}\lesssim 21$.} The presence of a rapid
rotation can make the split of main sequence of young star clusters more

using drugs to eradicate unwanted pathogenic cells. However, using drugs to
kill bacteria, viruses or cancer cells has the serious side effect of selecting
for mutant types that survive the drug attack. A key question therefore is how
one could eradicate as many cells as possible for a given acceptable risk of
drug resistance evolution. We address this general question in a model of drug
resistance evolution in spatial drug gradients, which recent experiments and
theories have suggested as key drivers of drug resistance. Importantly, our
model takes into account the influence of convection, resulting for instance
from blood flow. Using stochastic simulations, we study the fates of individual
resistance mutations and quantify the trade-off between the killing of
wild-type cells and the rise of resistance mutations: shallow gradients and
convection into the antibiotic region promote wild-type death, at the cost of
increasing the establishment probability of resistance mutations. We can
explain these observed trends by modeling the adaptation process as a branching
random walk. Our analysis reveals that the trade-off between death and
adaptation depends on the relative length scales of the spatial drug gradient
and random dispersal, and the strength of convection. Our results show that
convection can have a momentous effect on the rate of establishment of new
mutations, and may heavily impact the efficiency of antibiotic treatment.

the NC community due to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonances
(LSPRs) in the near infrared (NIR). The high level of doping in such materials
with carrier densities in the range of 1021 cm^-3 leads to degeneracy of the
doping levels and intense plasmonic absorption in the NIR. The lower carrier
density in degenerately doped semiconductor NCs compared to noble metals
enables LSPR tuning over a wide spectral range, since even a minor change of
the carrier density strongly affects the spectral position of the LSPR. We
focus on copper chalcogenide NCs and impurity doped metal oxide NCs as the most
investigated alternatives to noble metals. We shed light on the structural
changes upon LSPR tuning in vacancy doped copper chalcogenide NCs and deliver a
picture for the fundamentally different mechanism of LSPR modification of
impurity doped metal oxide NCs. We review on the peculiar optical properties of
plasmonic degenerately doped NCs by highlighting the variety of different
optical measurements and optical modeling approaches. These findings are merged

several types of ""system noise"" that can result in major degradation of
performance: bottlenecks due to limited communication bandwidth, latency due to
straggler nodes, etc. On the other hand, these systems enjoy abundance of
redundancy - a vast number of computing nodes and large storage capacity. There
have been recent results that demonstrate the impact of coding for efficient
utilization of computation and storage redundancy to alleviate the effect of
stragglers and communication bottlenecks in homogeneous clusters. In this
paper, we focus on general heterogeneous distributed computing clusters
consisting of a variety of computing machines with different capabilities. We
propose a coding framework for speeding up distributed computing in
heterogeneous clusters by trading redundancy for reducing the latency of
computation. In particular, we propose Heterogeneous Coded Matrix
Multiplication (HCMM) algorithm for performing distributed matrix
multiplication over heterogeneous clusters that is provably asymptotically
optimal for a broad class of processing time distributions. Moreover, we show
that HCMM is unboundedly faster than any uncoded scheme. To demonstrate
practicality of HCMM, we carry out experiments over Amazon EC2 clusters where
HCMM is found to be up to $61\%$, $46\%$ and $36\%$ respectively faster than
three benchmark load allocation schemes - Uniform Uncoded, Load-balanced
Uncoded, and Uniform Coded. Additionally, we provide a generalization to the
problem of optimal load allocation in heterogeneous settings, where we take
into account the monetary costs associated with the clusters. We argue that
HCMM is asymptotically optimal for budget-constrained scenarios as well, and we
develop a heuristic algorithm for (HCMM) load allocation for budget-limited
computation tasks.

diffusion problem with a log-normal random coefficient is considered. The
random coefficient is assumed to be given by an exponential of a Gaussian
random field that is represented by a series expansion of some system of
functions. Graham et al. [16] developed a lattice-based QMC theory for this
problem and established a quadrature error decay rate $\approx 1$ with respect
to the number of quadrature points. The key assumption there was a suitable
summability condition on the aforementioned system of functions. As a
consequence, product-order-dependent (POD) weights were used to construct the
lattice rule. In this paper, a different assumption on the system is
considered. This assumption, originally considered by Bachmayr et al. [3] to
utilise the locality of support of basis functions in the context of polynomial
approximations applied to the same type of the diffusion problem, is shown to
work well in the same lattice-based QMC method considered by Graham et al.: the
assumption leads us to product weights, which enables the construction of the
QMC method with a smaller computational cost than Graham et al. A quadrature
error decay rate $\approx 1$ is established, and the theory developed here is
applied to a wavelet stochastic model. By a characterisation of the Besov
smoothness, it is shown that a wide class of path smoothness can be treated
with this framework.

concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport
comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one
sport to another. In this manuscript, we develop Bayesian state-space models
using betting market data that can be uniformly applied across sporting
organizations to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes.
These models can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the
between-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths,
as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade
of play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League

finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the
largest home advantage, while the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative
randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing new metrics for judging
competitiveness across sports leagues, both within the regular season and using
traditional postseason tournament formats. Although we focus on sports, we
discuss a number of other situations in which our generalizable models might be
usefully applied.

general nonlinear boundary value problems in physics. This method is
established based on Coiflet approximation of multiple integrals of interval
bounded functions combined with an accurate and adjustable boundary extension
technique. The convergence order of this approximation has been proven to be N
as long as the Coiflet with N-1 vanishing moment is adopted, which can be any
positive even integers. Before the conventional collocation method is applied
to the general problems, the original differential equation is changed into its
equivalent form by denoting derivatives of the unknown function as new
functions and constructing relations between the low and high order
derivatives. For the linear cases, error analysis has proven that the proposed
WICM is order N, and condition numbers of relevant matrices are almost
independent of the number of collocation points. Numerical examples of a wide
range of nonlinear differential equations in physics demonstrate that accuracy
of the proposed WICM is even greater than N, and most interestingly, such
accuracy is independent of the order of the differential equation to be solved.
Comparison to existing numerical methods further justifies the accuracy and
efficiency of the proposed method.

  Theorem 0.1 shows an improvement in the best known bound while Theorem 0.2
shows for which primes we can prove the theoretical lower bound.
  After some introductory information in Chapter 1, we will start to prove the
above theorems in Chapter 2. We will introduce an indicator function for
primitive roots of primes in {\S}2.1 and together with results from {\S}1.2.1,
{\S}1.2.3 and {\S}1.2.4 we will outline the first step in proving a general

Chapter 3. These two stages require the introduction of the prime sieve. Before
defining the sieve in {\S}3.2 we will introduce the $e-$free integers which
will play an important role in defining the sieve.
  In {\S}3.2 we will obtain results that do not require computation, including

important to PNC decoding. This paper addresses the problem of
symbol-misalignment estimation and the problem of optimal PNC decoding given
the misalignment estimate, assuming the APNC system uses the root-raised-cosine
pulse to carry signals (RRC-APNC). First, we put forth an optimal
symbol-misalignment estimator that makes use of double baud-rate samples. Then,
we devise optimal decoders for RRC-APNC in the presence of inaccurate
symbol-misalignment estimates. In particular, we present a new whitening
transformation to whiten the noise of the double baud-rate samples. Finally, we
investigate the decoding performance of various estimation-and-decoding schemes
for RRC-APNC. Extensive simulations show that: (i) Our double baud-rate
estimator yields substantially more accurate symbol-misalignment estimates than
the baud-rate estimator does. The mean-square-error (MSE) gains are up to 8 dB.
(ii) An overall estimation-and-decoding scheme in which both estimation and
decoding are based on double baud-rate samples yields much better performance
than other schemes. Compared with a scheme in which both estimation and
decoding are based on baud-rate samples), the double baud-rate sampling scheme
yields 4.5 dB gains on symbol error rate (SER) performance in an AWGN channel,
and 2 dB gains on packet error rate (PER) performance in a Rayleigh fading
channel.

energy efficiency of a server based on this ARM64 CPU, relative to a comparable

results show that the ARM64 server's runtime performance is comparable to the

lags behind for floating-point intensive benchmarks like PageRank, when they do
not exploit data parallelism adequately. We also see that the ARM64 server
takes $\frac{1}{3}^{rd}$ the energy, and has an Energy Delay Product (EDP) that
is $50-71\%$ lower than the x64 server. These results hold promise for ARM64
data centers hosting Big Data workloads to reduce their operational costs,

applications in wireless networking, robotics, and geometry, and are

characterized by a considerable excess current due to Andreev reflection of

reveal that LaSrCuO is a superconductor with a strong coupling since the
maximum value of the ratio $2\Delta/kT\simeq 11$. It is found that
superconducting properties may vary appreciably over distances of several tens
of angstroms, resulting in some cases in the simultaneous emergence of two gaps

at most $s$ active predictors where $x \sim N(0,I_{p})$. We first introduce a
large class of models depending on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue $\lambda$
of $var(\mathbb{E}[x|y])$, over which we show that an aggregated estimator
based on the SIR procedure converges at rate
$d\wedge((sd+s\log(ep/s))/(n\lambda))$. We then show that this rate is optimal
in two scenarios: the single index models; and the multiple index models with
fixed central dimension $d$ and fixed $\lambda$. By assuming a technical
conjecture, we can show that this rate is also optimal for multiple index
models with bounded dimension of the central space. We believe that these
(conditional) optimal rate results bring us meaningful insights of general SDR

defined over spheres across time. In particular, the associated covariance

high-salinity brine component $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \geq -4.5\unicode{x2030},
\geq 90 \text{g Cl}^{-}/\text{L})$ with strongly depleted atmospheric noble gas
concentrations. The $^{81}$Kr measurements are interpreted within this mixing
framework to estimate the age of the end-members. Deconvoluted $^{81}$Kr ages
range from 300 ka to 1.3 Ma for interglacial or recent meteoric water and
glacial meltwater. For the brine component, ages exceed the dating range of the
ATTA 3 instrument of 1.3 Ma. The radiogenic noble gas components $^{4}$He* and

Based on the chemical and noble gas concentrations and the dating results, we
conclude that the brine originates from evaporated seawater that has been

distances, a joint fitting of the SNe Ia light-curve parameters, cosmological

free electrons deplete photons from standard candles through the (inverse)

maximum masses of neutron stars with these realistic potentials are around
$2.18 M_\odot$ and their corresponding radii are around $11$ km. These results

with structural relaxation, hydrogen bond breakage, stress relaxation, and
dynamic heterogeneities can be definitely classified into only two classes.
That is, we propose the generalized SE relations that exhibit ""violation"" or
""preservation"". The classification depends on the examined time scales that are
coupled or decoupled with the diffusion. On the basis of the classification, we
explain the physical origins of the violation in terms of the increase in the
plateau modulus and the nonexponentiality of stress relaxation. This implies
that the mechanism of SE violation is attributed to the attained solidity upon
supercooling, which is in accord with the growth of non-Gaussianity and
spatially heterogeneous dynamics.

much weaker than those of the radiation pressure and the atom-atom

intensity of the laser pump is strong enough. On the other hand, there is a
competition between the CK nonlinearity and the atom-atom interaction so that

nonlinearity causes the effective frequency of the Bogoliubov mode of the BEC

and forward angles including 0 degree and a comparison to results from a
similar study using backward-angle electron scattering at low momentum
transfers in order to estimate their contribution to the total B(M1) strength.
M1 cross sections of individual peaks in the spectra are deduced with a
multipole decomposition analysis. The corresponding reduced B(M1) transition
strengths are extracted following the approach outlined in J. Birkhan et al.,
Phys. Rev. C 93, 041302(R) (2016). In total, 29 peaks containing a M1
contribution are found in the excitation energy region 7 - 13 MeV. The
resulting B(M1) strength distribution compares well to the electron scattering
results considering different factors limiting the sensitivity in both
experiments and the enhanced importance of mechanisms breaking the
proportionality of nuclear cross sections and electromagnetic matrix elements
for weak transitions as studied here. The total strength of 1.19(6) $\mu_N^2$
deduced assuming a non-quenched isoscalar part of the (p,p') cross sections
agrees with the (e,e') result of 1.21(13) $\mu_N^2$. A binwise analysis above
10 MeV provides an upper limit of 1.62(23) $\mu_N^2$. The present results
confirm that weak transitions contribute about 25% to the total B(M1) strength
in $^{48}$Ca and the quenching factors of GT and spin-M1 strength are
comparable in fp-shell nuclei. Thus, the role of of meson exchange currents
seems to be neglible, in contrast to sd-shell nuclei.

discrete Lie group configurations the associated Lie algebras such that
elements of the latter correspond to weighted velocity fields that satisfy the
divergence-free conditions for both systems. Defining discrete Lagrangians in
terms of these Lie algebras, the discrete equations follow by means of
variational principles. Descending from variational principles, the schemes
exhibit further a discrete version of Kelvin circulation theorem, are
applicable to irregular meshes, and show excellent long term energy behavior.

3.5 to 4.5, whereas no precipitation was observed at pH 2.0-3.0 or pH 4.5-7.0.
The isoelectric point of CMs-GP was determined to be pH 3.7. Highest stability
against heat and ethanol was observed for CMs-GP at pH 2, where visible
coagulation was determined only after 800 s at 140 $^\circ$C or 87.5% (v/v) of
ethanol. These results confirmed the hypothesis that cross-linking by GP
increased the stability of CMs.

sizes by controlling the temperature in polycondensation reaction of glucose
under hydrothermal process. The surface morphology, structural, optical, and
thermal properties of as synthesized particles were characterized using TEM,
SEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, and DSC. The particles morphology and
dispersity were modified and reduced their size after calcination at $500^{o}
C$ in comparison to those without calcinated. Thermal study also indicates
particles change their phase from amorphous to crystalline and achieve thermal
stability after $520^{o}C$, which can also be verified by presence of D-band
and G-band in Raman spectrum. Overall results indicate that the carbon
nanospheres are hard solids and highly dispersed with size ranges from 50 nm to
300 nm.

determine the alternating sum generally in the hyperbolic Pascal triangle
