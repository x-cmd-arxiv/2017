conductor (SIC) as gate dielectric, we have successfully tuned carrier density
in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ thin flakes, and the electronic phase diagram has
been mapped out. It is found that electron doping controlled by SIC-FET leads
to a suppression of the superconducting phase, and eventually gives rise to an
insulating state in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. During the gating process, the
(001) peak in XRD patterns stays at the same position and no new diffraction
peak emerges, indicating no evident Li$^+$ ions intercalation into the
FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. It indicates that a systematic change of electronic
properties in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ arises from the electrostatic doping
induced by the accumulation of Li$^+$ ions at the interface between
FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ and solid ion conductor in the devices. It is striking
that these findings are drastically different from the observation in FeSe thin
flakes using the same SIC-FET, in which $T_c$ is enhanced from 8 K to larger
than 40 K, then the system goes into an insulating phase accompanied by
structural transitions.

diffraction process. Importantly, the physical reason of {\pi} phase jump can
be attributed to that the two even grating modes make the left derivative and
right derivative of real part of the E1 opposite in sign, which results in the
physical information of first order diffractive wave hidden in the near field
Talbot effect image. We expect that this theoretical work will be helpful for

Among the nonparametric approaches, the distance-based methods (such as the
distance correlation based hypotheses testing for independence) have numerous
advantages, comparing with many other alternatives. A known limitation of the
distance-based method is that its computational complexity can be high. In
general, when the sample size is $n$, the order of computational complexity of
a distance-based method, which typically requires computing of all pairwise
distances, can be $O(n^2)$. Recent advances have discovered that in the {\it
univariate} cases, a fast method with $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity
and $O(n)$ memory requirement exists. In this paper, we introduces a test of
independence method based on random projection and distance correlation, which
achieves nearly the same power as the state-of-the-art distance-based approach,
works in the {\it multivariate} cases, and enjoys the $O(n K \log n)$
computational complexity and $O(\max\{n,K\})$ memory requirement, where $K$ is
the number of random projections. Note that saving is achieved when $K < n/\log
n$. We name our method a Randomly Projected Distance Covariance (RPDC). The
statistical theoretical analysis takes advantage of some techniques on random
projection which are rooted in contemporary machine learning. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, in relative to
several competitors.

in the universe that occur roughly once per day and are characterized by
flashes of gamma-rays typically lasting from a fraction of a second to
thousands of seconds. Even after more than four decades since their discovery
they still remain not fully understood. Two types of GRBs are observed:
spectrally harder short duration bursts and softer long duration bursts. The
long GRBs originate from the collapse of massive stars whereas the preferred
model for the short GRBs is coalescence of compact objects such as two neutron
stars or a neutron star and a black hole. There were suggestions that GRBs can
produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. Also a certain sub-type of
GRBs may serve as a new standard candle that can help constrain and measure the
cosmological parameters to much higher redshift than what was possible so far.

charm meson $D^0$ at mid-rapidity ($|y|$\,$<$\,1) in Au+Au collisions at \sNN =
200\,GeV. The measurement was conducted by the STAR experiment at RHIC
utilizing a new high-resolution silicon tracker. The measured $D^0$ $v_2$ in
0--80\% centrality Au+Au collisions can be described by a viscous hydrodynamic
calculation for transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) less than 4\,GeV/$c$. The
$D^0$ $v_2$ as a function of transverse kinetic energy ($m_{\rm T} - m_0$,
where $m_{\rm T} = \sqrt{p_{\rm T}^2 + m_0^2}$) is consistent with that of
light mesons in 10--40\% centrality Au+Au collisions. These results suggest
that charm quarks have achieved local thermal equilibrium with the medium
created in such collisions. Several theoretical models, with the
temperature--dependent, dimensionless charm spatial diffusion coefficient
($2{\pi}TD_s$) in the range of $\sim$2--12, are able to simultaneously
reproduce our $D^0$ $v_2$ result and our previously published results for the

most popular approach for the fabrication of graphne/h-BN heterostructures so
far. The orientation between graphene and h-BN lattices, however, are not
controllable and the h-BN/graphene interfaces are prone to be contaminated
during this elaborate process. Direct synthesis of graphene on h-BN is an
alternative and rapidly growing approach. Synthesized graphene via such
approaches is personally tailored to conform to each specific h-BN flakes,
hence the limitations of conventional fabrication approaches are overcome.
Reported processes paved the initial steps to improve the scalablity of the
device fabrication for industrial applications. Reviewing the developments in
the field, from the birth point to the current status is the focus of this
letter. We show how the field has been developed to overcome the existing
challenges one after the other and discuss where the field is heading to.

creates an unprecedented need for inexpensive, low-latency, and high-density
information storage. This need has motivated significant research into
multi-level memory systems that can store multiple bits of information per
device. Although both the memory state of these devices and much of the data
they store are intrinsically analog-valued, both are quantized for use with
digital systems and discrete error correcting codes. Using phase change memory
as a prototypical multi-level storage technology, we herein demonstrate that
analog-valued devices can achieve higher capacities when paired with analog
codes. Further, we find that storing analog signals directly through
joint-coding can achieve low distortion with reduced coding complexity. By
jointly optimizing for signal statistics, device statistics, and a distortion
metric, finite-length analog encodings can perform comparable to digital
systems with asymptotically infinite large encodings. These results show that
end-to-end analog memory systems have not only the potential to reach higher
storage capacities than discrete systems, but also to significantly lower
coding complexity, leading to faster and more energy efficient storage.

discussed, such that their total cost is minimized. We assume that costs are
not known exactly, but stem from a set of possible outcomes.
  Robust recoverable and two-stage models of this selection problem are
analyzed. In the two-stage problem, up to $p$ items is chosen in the first
stage, and the solution is completed once the scenario becomes revealed in the
second stage. In the recoverable problem, a set of $p$ items is selected in the
first stage, and can be modified by exchanging up to $k$ items in the second
stage, after a scenario reveals.
  We assume that uncertain costs are modeled through bounded uncertainty sets,
i.e., the interval uncertainty sets with an additional linear (budget)
constraint, in their discrete and continuous variants. Polynomial algorithms
for recoverable and two-stage selection problems with continuous bounded
uncertainty, and compact mixed integer formulations in the case of discrete
bounded uncertainty are constructed.

$p = 0$ or $p > 13$. We start with a classification already obtained by the

  Interestingly, in the way to get these families for the different strata, we
find two remarkable phenomenons that did not appear before. One is the
existence of a non $0$-dimensional final stratum of plane curves. At a first
sight it may sound odd, but we will see that this is a normal situation for
higher degrees and we will give a explanation for it.
  We explicitly describe representative families for all strata, except for the
stratum with automorphism group $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$. Here we find the
second difference with the lower genus cases where the previous techniques do
not fully work. Fortunately, we are still able to prove the existence of such

the formation of galaxies in the Universe. In a hierarchical clustering
paradigm it is plausible that there is a connection between the properties of
galaxies and their environments. Evidence for environmental trends has been
established in the local Universe. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) provides large
photometric datasets that enable further investigation of the assembly of mass.
In this study we use ~3.2 million galaxies from the (South Pole Telescope)
SPT-East field in the DES science verification (SV) dataset. From grizY
photometry we derive galaxy stellar masses and absolute magnitudes, and
determine the errors on these properties using Monte-Carlo simulations using
the full photometric redshift probability distributions. We compute galaxy
environments using a fixed conical aperture for a range of scales. We construct
galaxy environment probability distribution functions and investigate the
dependence of the environment errors on the aperture parameters. We compute the
environment components of the galaxy stellar mass function for the redshift
range 0.15<z<1.05. For z<0.75 we find that the fraction of massive galaxies is
larger in high density environment than in low density environments. We show
that the low density and high density components converge with increasing
redshift up to z~1.0 where the shapes of the mass function components are
indistinguishable. Our study shows how high density structures build up around
massive galaxies through cosmic time.

question, still unsolved, since the discovery that quasars could be radio-quiet
or radio-loud. Recently several groups identified RWBL candidates, mostly found
while searching for low energy counterparts of the unidentified/unassociated
gamma-ray sources listed in the Fermi catalogs. Confirming RWBLs is a
challenging task since they could be confused with white dwarfs (WDs) or weak
emission line quasars (WELQs) when there are not sufficient data to precisely
draw their broad band spectral energy distribution and their classification is
mainly based on a featureless optical spectra. Motivated by the recent
discovery that Fermi BL Lacs appear to have very peculiar mid-IR emission, we
show that it is possible to distinguish between WDs, WELQs and BL Lacs using
the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12]$\mu$m color-color plot built using the WISE magnitudes

identify WISE J064459.38+603131 and WISE J141046.00+740511.2 as the first two
genuine RWBLs, both potentially associated with Fermi sources. Finally, to
strengthen our identification of these objects as true RWBLs, we present
multifrequency observations for these two candidates to show that their
spectral behavior is indeed consistent with those of the BL Lac population.

applications. Common intuition is that defects with shallow levels act as
carrier providers and defects with deep levels are carrier killers. Here,
taking the Cu defects in CdTe as an example, we show that shallow defects can
play both roles. Using first-principles calculation methods combined with
thermodynamic simulations, we study the dialectic effects of Cu-related defects
on hole density and lifetime in bulk CdTe over a wide range of Cu incorporation
conditions. Because CuCd can form a relatively shallow acceptor in CdTe, we
find that increased Cu incorporation into CdTe indeed can help achieve high
hole density; however, too much Cu can cause significant non-radiative
recombination. We discuss two strategies to balance the contradictory effects
of Cu defects based on the calculated impact of Cd chemical potential, copper
defect concentrations, and incorporation temperature on lifetime and hole
density. The results indicates that to optimize the Cu doping in CdTe, it is
important to control the total amount of Cu incorporated into CdTe and optimize
the match between the Cu incorporation temperature and the Cd chemical
potential. These findings can help understand the roles of Cu defects in CdTe
and the potential complex defect behaviors of relatively shallow defect states
in semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.

heterogeneous graphs under heterophily assumption. Homophily label propagation
(i.e., two connected nodes share similar labels) in homogeneous graph (with
same types of vertices and relations) has been extensively studied before.
Unfortunately, real-life networks are heterogeneous, they contain different
types of vertices (e.g., users, images, texts) and relations (e.g.,
friendships, co-tagging) and allow for each node to propagate both the same and
opposite copy of labels to its neighbors. We propose a $\mathcal{K}$-partite
label propagation model to handle the mystifying combination of heterogeneous
nodes/relations and heterophily propagation. With this model, we develop a
novel label inference algorithm framework with update rules in near-linear time
complexity. Since real networks change over time, we devise an incremental
approach, which supports fast updates for both new data and evidence (e.g.,
ground truth labels) with guaranteed efficiency. We further provide a utility
function to automatically determine whether an incremental or a re-modeling
approach is favored. Extensive experiments on real datasets have verified the

accepted physical model of transcription predicts the existence of a physical
limit on the maximal rate of transcription, which does not depend on the
transcribed gene. This limit appears as a result of polymerase ""traffic jams""
forming in the bulk of the 1D DNA chain at high polymerase concentrations.
Recent experiments have, for the first time, allowed one to access live gene
expression dynamics in the Drosophila fly embryo in vivo under the conditions
of heavy polymerase load and test the predictions of the model. Our analysis of
the data shows that the maximal rate of transcription is indeed the same for
the Hunchback, Snail and Knirps gap genes, and modified gene constructs in
nuclear cycles 13, 14, but the experimentally observed value of the maximal
transcription rate corresponds to only 40 % of the one predicted by this model.
We argue that such a decrease must be due to a slower polymerase elongation
rate in the vicinity of the promoter region. This effectively shifts the
bottleneck of transcription from the bulk to the promoter region of the gene.
We suggest a quantitative explanation of the difference by taking into account
abortive transcription initiation. Our calculations based on the independently
measured abortive initiation constant in vitro confirm this hypothesis and find
quantitative agreement with MS2 fluorescence live imaging data in the early
fruit fly embryo. If our explanation is correct, then the transcription rate
cannot be increased by replacing ""slow codons"" in the bulk with synonymous
codons, and experimental efforts must be focused on the promoter region
instead. This study extends our understanding of transcriptional regulation,
re-examines physical constraints on the kinetics of transcription and
re-evaluates the validity of the standard TASEP model of transcription.

invariance by a Lifshitz-type of anisotropic scaling between space and time at
the ultra-high energy, while recovering (approximately) the invariance at low
energies. With the stringent observational constraints and self-consistency, it
turns out that this is not an easy task, and various modifications have been

the theory in three different but also related areas: (i) universal horizons,

structures comprised of two and three materials considering large motion
sliding contact and separation along interfaces. The structural geometry is
defined by an explicit level set method, which allows for both shape and
topology changes. The mechanical model assumes finite strains, a nonlinear
elastic material behavior, and a quasi-static response. Identification of
overlapping surface position is handled by a coupled parametric representation
of contact surfaces. A stabilized Lagrange method and an active set strategy
are used to model frictionless contact and separation. The mechanical model is
discretized by the extended finite element method which maintains a clear
definition of geometry. Face-oriented ghost penalization and dynamic relaxation
are implemented to improve the stability of the physical response prediction. A
nonlinear programming scheme is used to solve the optimization problem, which
is regularized by introducing a perimeter penalty into the objective function.
Sensitivities are determined by the adjoint method. The main characteristics of
the proposed method are studied by numerical examples in two dimensions. The
numerical results demonstrate improved design performance when compared to
models optimized with a small strain assumption. Additionally, examples with
load path dependent objectives display non-intuitive designs.

  Correlations Revisited","9 pages, 7 figures, ApJ in press",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa5b9b",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Luminosity correlations of long Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are extensively
proposed as an effective complementarity to trace the Hubble diagram of
Universe at high redshifts, which is of great importance to explore properties
of dark energy. Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been
statistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the
distance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of
luminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the
Amati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the
equivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\rm p}-E_{\rm iso}$), as an example,
and find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution
of the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we
propose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to
correct the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check
the reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.
Importantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take
whole correlations between $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.
Neglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain
the biased constraint on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of
parameters for the calibration. A small shift of parameters of ""calibrated""
relation could significantly change the final constraint on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in
the low-redshift calibration method. Finally, we simulate several GRB samples
with different statistical errors and find that, in order to correctly recover
the fiducial value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ using the low-redshift calibration
method, we need a large number of GRB samples with high precisions.

incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements),
and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of
the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and
adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input
instances arrive sequentially in batches, the neuronal-birth is implemented by
adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the
number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation
error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate.
Neuronal-death is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity)
on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each
iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between
the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation
is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical
evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on
synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably
outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of
Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we

importance of electron correlation effects in these materials, and Hund
exchange interaction has been suggested to be the dominant correlation effect
in FeSCs because of their multiband nature. By this reasoning, correlation
should be strongest for materials closest to a half filled 3d shell (Mn

(electron doped FeSCs) and lower (Cr pnictides) 3d counts. Here we address the
strength of correlation effects in BaCr2As2 by means of angle resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and first principles calculations. This
combination provides us with two handles on the strength of correlation, First,
a comparison of the experimental and calculated effective masses yields the
correlation induced mass renormalisation. In addition, the lifetime broadening
of the experimentally observed dispersions provides another measure of the
correlation strength. Both approaches reveal a reduction of electron
correlation in BaCr2As2 with respect to systems with a 3d count closer to five.
Our results thereby support the theoretical predictions that Hund's exchange

two types of multimodal images: one is near-infrared gray image (NGI) and the
other is the visible color image (VCI). NGI is noise-free but it is grayscale,
whereas the VCI has colors but it contains noise. Moreover, there exist serious
edge and brightness discrepancies between NGI and VCI. To deal with this
problem, a new transfer-based fusion method is proposed for noise removal.
Different from conventional fusion approaches, the proposed method conducts a
series of transfers: contrast, detail, and color transfers. First, the proposed
contrast and detail transfers aim at solving the serious discrepancy problem,
thereby creating a new noise-free and detail-preserving NGI. Second, the
proposed color transfer models the unknown colors from the denoised VCI via a

constructed using different constraints. For this purpose, we address a problem
of optimization on ensembles of products of submanifolds (PEMs) of convolution
kernels. To this end, we first propose three strategies to construct ensembles
of PEMs in CNNs. Next, we expound their geometric properties (metric and
curvature properties) in CNNs. We make use of our theoretical results by
developing a geometry-aware SGD algorithm (G-SGD) for optimization on ensembles
of PEMs to train CNNs. Moreover, we analyze convergence properties of G-SGD
considering geometric properties of PEMs. In the experimental analyses, we
employ G-SGD to train CNNs on Cifar-10, Cifar-100 and Imagenet datasets. The
results show that geometric adaptive step size computation methods of G-SGD can
improve training loss and convergence properties of CNNs. Moreover, we observe
that classification performance of baseline CNNs can be boosted using G-SGD on
ensembles of PEMs identified by multiple constraints.

widely applied methods suffer from. In this study we are mainly concerned with
standard methods to analyse stellar spectra. This includes the analysis of
individual lines to determine stellar parameters, analysis of the broad wings
of certain lines (e.g., H$\alpha$ and calcium lines) to determine effective
temperature and surface gravity for the stars. For NGC 6528 we find that [Fe/H]
= $+0.04$ dex with a scatter of $\sigma=0.07$ dex, which gives an error in the
derived mean abundance of 0.02 dex. Our work has two important conclusions for
analysis of metal-rich red giant branch stars. 1) For spectra with S/N below
about 35 per reduced pixel [Fe/H] become too high, 2) Determination of $T_{\rm
eff}$ using the wings of the H$\alpha$ line results in [Fe/H] values about 0.1
dex higher than if excitational equilibrium is used. The last conclusion is
perhaps not surprising as we expect NLTE effect to become more prominent in
cooler stars and we can not use the the wings of the H$\alpha$ line to
determine $T_{\rm eff}$ for the cool stars in our sample. We therefore
recommend that in studies of metal-rich red giant stars care needs to be taken
to obtain sufficient calibration data in order to be able to also use the

cope with the problem is to approximate the edit distance by another distance
with a lower computational cost. There are, indeed, many distances have been
proposed for approximating the edit distance. However, their approximation
accuracies are evaluated only theoretically: many of them are evaluated only
with big-oh (asymptotic) notations, and without experimental analysis.
Therefore, it is beneficial to know their actual performance in real
applications. In this study we compared existing six approximation distances in
two approaches: (i) we refined their theoretical approximation accuracy by
calculating up to the constant coefficients, and (ii) we conducted some
experiments, in one artificial and two real-life data sets, to reveal under
which situations they perform best. As a result we obtained the following
results: [Batu 2006] is the best theoretically and [Andoni 2010]

molecule in the emergence of terrestrial life. Although detected in the
interstellar medium for decades, its formation route is still debated, whether
in the gas phase or on the dust grain surfaces. Molecular deuteration has
proven to be, in other cases, an efficient way to identify how a molecule is
synthesised. For formamide, new published observations towards the
IRAS16293-2422 B hot corino show that its three deuterated forms have all the
same deuteration ratio, 2--5%, and that this is a factor 3--8 smaller than that
measured for H2CO towards the IRAS16293-2422 protostar. Following a previous
work on the gas-phase formamide formation via the reaction NH2 + H2CO -> HCONH2
+ H, we present here new calculations of the rate coefficients for the
production of monodeuterated formamide through the same reaction, starting from
monodeuterated NH2 or H2CO. Some misconceptions regarding our previous
treatment of the reaction are also cleared up. The results of the new
computations show that, at the 100 K temperature of the hot corino, the rate of
deuteration of the three forms is the same, within 20%. On the contrary, the
reaction between non-deuterated species proceeds three times faster than that
with deuterated ones. These results confirm that a gas-phase route for the
formation of formamide is perfectly in agreement with the available
observations.

of $G$ satisfies $\lambda (G') < \lambda (G)$, where $\lambda (G)$ is the
Lagrangian of a hypergraph $G$. In 1980's, Sidorenko showed that $\pi(F)$, the
Tur\'an density of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $F$ is $r!$ multiplying the
supremum of the Lagrangians of all dense $F$-hom-free $r$-uniform hypergraphs.
This connection has been applied in estimating Tur\'an density of hypergraphs.
When $r=2$, the result of Motzkin and Straus shows that a graph is dense if and
only if it is a complete graph. However, when $r\ge 3$, it becomes much harder
to estimate the Lagrangians of $r$-uniform hypergraphs and to characterize the
structure of all dense $r$-uniform graphs. The main goal of this note is to
give some sufficient conditions for $3$-uniform graphs with given substructures

edges containing $[t-1]^{(3)}$, then $G$ is dense if and only if $m \ge {t-1

novel perception-based energy function in the seam-cutting framework, which
considers the nonlinearity and the nonuniformity of human perception in energy
minimization. Our perception-based approach adopts a sigmoid metric to
characterize the perception of color discrimination, and a saliency weight to
simulate that human eyes incline to pay more attention to salient objects. In
addition, our seam-cutting composition can be easily implemented into other
stitching pipelines. Experiments show that our method outperforms the
seam-cutting method of the normal energy function, and a user study
demonstrates that our composed results are more consistent with human
perception.

($L_{\rm X}$), and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) and black hole binaries is known to exist and is called the ""Fundamental
Plane"" of black hole activity. Yuan & Cui (2005) predicts that the radio/X-ray
correlation index, $\xi_{\rm X}$, changes from $\xi_{\rm X}\approx 0.6$ to
$\xi_{\rm X}\approx 1.2-1.3$ when $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ decreases below a
critical value $\sim 10^{-6}$. While many works favor such a change, there are
also several works claiming the opposite. In this paper, we gather from
literature a largest quiescent AGN (defined as $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd} <
10^{-6}$) sample to date, consisting of $75$ sources. We find that these
quiescent AGNs follow a $\xi_{\rm X}\approx 1.23$ radio/X-ray relationship, in
excellent agreement with the Yuan \& Cui prediction. The reason for the
discrepancy between the present result and some previous works is that their
samples contain not only quiescent sources but also ""normal"" ones (i.e.,
$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd} > 10^{-6}$). In this case, the quiescent sources will
mix up with those normal ones in $L_{\rm R}$ and $L_{\rm X}$. The value of
$\xi_{\rm X}$ will then be between $0.6$ and $\sim1.3$, with the exact value
being determined by the sample composition, i.e., the fraction of the quiescent
and normal sources. Based on this result, we propose that a more physical way
to study the Fundamental Plane is to replace $L_{\rm R}$ and $L_{\rm X}$ with
$L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$, respectively.

quality collaboration within the team. Since the success rate of software
development projects is low (Wateridge, 1995; The Standish Group, 2009), it is
important to understand which characteristics of interactions within software
development teams significantly influence performance. Hoegl and Gemuenden
(2001) reported empirical evidence for the relation between teamwork quality

article extends the work of Hoegl and Gemuenden (2001) with the aim of finding
additional factors that may influence software team performance. We introduce
three new TWQ factors: trust, value sharing, and coordination of expertise. The
relationship between TWQ and team performance and the improvement of the model
are tested using data from 252 team members and stakeholders. Results show that
teamwork quality is significantly related to team performance, as rated by both
team members and stakeholders: TWQ explains 81% of the variance of team
performance as rated by team members and 61% as rated by stakeholders. This
study shows that trust, shared values, and coordination of expertise are
important factors for team leaders to consider in order to achieve high quality

can induce random transitions from one stable state to another. For low noise,
the times between transitions have an exponential tail and Kramers' formula
gives an expression for the mean escape time in the asymptotic limit. If a
number of multistable systems are coupled into a network structure, a
transition at one site may change the transition properties at other sites. We

regimes of transition, depending on coupling strength. For small coupling
strengths the transition rates are simply modified but the transitions remain
stochastic. For large coupling strengths transitions happen approximately in
synchrony - we call this a ""fast domino"" regime. There is also an intermediate
coupling regime some transitions happen inexorably but with a delay that may be
arbitrarily long - we call this a ""slow domino"" regime. We characterise these
regimes in the low noise limit in terms of bifurcations of the potential

a representation formula which allows for its computation without requiring

article. The analysis is performed within semi-classical transport theory with
isotropic and anisotropic momentum distribution functions for the gluonic and
quark-antiquark degrees of freedom that constitutes the hot QCD plasma. The
isotropic/equilibrium momentum distributions for gluons and quarks are based on
a recent quasi-particle description of hot QCD equations of state. The
anisotropic distributions are just the extensions of isotropic ones by
stretching or squeezing them in one of the directions. The hot QCD medium
effects in the model adopted here enter through the effective gluon and quark
fugacities along with non-trivial dispersion relations leading to an effective
QCD coupling constant. Interestingly, with these distribution functions the
tensorial structure of the gluon polarization tensor in the medium turned out
to be similar to the one for the non-interacting ultra-relativistic system of
quarks/antiquarks and gluons . The interactions mainly modify the Debye mass
parameter and , in turn, the effective coupling in the medium. These
modifications have been seen to modify the collective modes of the hot QCD
plasma in a significant way.

nevertheless carries a nontrivial energy current between the thermostats. By
means of the fermionization technique, for a chain initially in equilibrium at
an arbitrary temperature $T_0$ we calculate the Fourier transform of the
probability $P({\cal Q};\tau)$ for the time-integrated energy current ${\cal
Q}$ during a finite time interval $\tau$. In the long time limit we determine
the corresponding generating function for the cumulants per site and unit of

$n=1,2,3,4.$ We exhibit various phenomena in specific regimes: kinetic
mean-field effects when one thermostat flips any spin less often than the other
one, as well as dissipation towards a thermostat at zero temperature. Moreover,
when the system size $N$ goes to infinity while the effective temperature $T$
vanishes, the cumulants of ${\cal Q}$ per unit of time grow linearly with $N$
and are equal to those of a random walk process. In two adequate scaling
regimes involving $T$ and $N$ we exhibit the dependence of the first correction
upon the ratio of the spin-spin correlation length $\xi(T)$ and the size $N$.

M_{\odot}$ in the outer halo of the Milky Way with a two-body relaxation time
of the order of a Hubble time. Yet, it is strongly mass segregated and contains
a stellar mass function depleted of low-mass stars. Pal 4 was either born this
way or it is a result of extraordinary dynamical evolution. Since two-body
relaxation cannot explain these signatures alone, enhanced mass loss through
tidal shocking may have had a strong influence on Pal 4. Here, we compute a
grid of direct N-body simulations to model Pal 4 on various eccentric orbits
within the Milky Way potential to find likely initial conditions that reproduce
its observed mass, half-light radius, stellar MF-slope and line-of-sight
velocity dispersion. We find that Pal 4 is most likely orbiting on an eccentric
orbit with an eccentricity of $e\approx 0.9$ and pericentric distance of
$R_p\approx5$ kpc. In this scenario, the required 3D half-mass radius at birth
is similar to the average sizes of typical GCs ($R_h\approx4-5$ pc), while its
birth mass is about $M_0\approx10^5 M_{\odot}$. We also find a high degree of
primordial mass segregation among the cluster stars, which seems to be
necessary in every scenario we considered. Thus, using the tidal effect to
constrain the perigalactic distance of the orbit of Pal 4, we predict that the
proper motion of Pal 4 should be in the range $-0.52\leq\mu_\delta\leq-0.38$
mas\,yr$^{-1}$ and $-0.30\leq\mu_{\alpha\cos\delta}\leq-0.15$ mas\,yr$^{-1}$.

that the glass state has a flat potential landscape, which is the critical

As a result, we can jointly optimize for the number of layers in the hierarchy,
the number of parts per layer and a foreground-background segmentation based on

supernova (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the mass transport
of gas on to galactic nuclei and the black hole (BH) growth down to redshift
z~6. We study the BH growth in relation with the mass transport processes
associated with gravity and pressure torques, and how they are modified by
feedback. Cosmological gas funelled through cold flows reaches the galactic
outer region close to free-fall. Then torques associated to pressure triggered
by gas turbulent motions produced in the circum-galactic medium by shocks and
explosions from SNe are the main source of mass transport beyond the central ~
100 pc. Due to high concentrations of mass in the central galactic region,
gravitational torques tend to be more important at high redshift. The combined
effect of almost free-falling material and both gravity and pressure torques
produces a mass accretion rate of order ~ 1 M_sun/yr at ~ pc scales. In the
absence of SN feedback, AGN feedback alone does not affect significantly either
star formation or BH growth until the BH reaches a sufficiently high mass of
$\sim 10^6$ M_sun to self-regulate. SN feedback alone, instead, decreases both
stellar and BH growth. Finally, SN and AGN feedback in tandem efficiently
quench the BH growth, while star formation remains at the levels set by SN
feedback alone due to the small final BH mass, ~ few 10^5 M_sun. SNe create a
more rarefied and hot environment where energy injection from the central AGN
can accelerate the gas further.

objects in the radio and X-ray bands, and one of the closest active galactic
nuclei observed in very-high energies. In GeV - TeV $\gamma$-rays, IC310 was
detected in low and high flux states by the MAGIC telescopes from October 2009
to February 2010. Taking into account that the spectral energy distribution
(SED) up to a few GeV seems to exhibit a double-peak feature and that a
single-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model can explain all of the
multiwavelength emission except for the non-simultaneous MAGIC emission, we
interpret, in this work, the multifrequency data set of the radio galaxy IC310
in the context of homogeneous hadronic and leptonic models. In the leptonic
framework, we present a multi-zone SSC model with two electron populations to
explain the whole SED whereas for the hadronic model, we propose that a
single-zone SSC model describes the SED up to a few GeVs and neutral pion decay
products resulting from p$\gamma$ interactions could describe the TeV - GeV
$\gamma$-ray spectra. These interactions occur when Fermi-accelerated protons
interact with the seed photons around the SSC peaks. We show that, in the
leptonic model the minimum Lorentz factor of second electron population is
exceedingly high $\gamma_e\sim10^5$ disfavoring this model, and in the hadronic
model the required proton luminosity is not extremely high $\sim 10^{44}$
erg/s, provided that charge neutrality between the number of electrons and
protons is given. Correlating the TeV $\gamma$-ray and neutrino spectra through
photo-hadronic interactions, we find that the contribution of the emitting
region of IC310 to the observed neutrino and ultra-high-energy cosmic ray
fluxes are negligible.

capacity and the optimal input distribution of this setting are calculated for
the case of an $(1,\infty)$-RLL input constraint, that is, the input sequence
contains no consecutive ones. These results are obtained via explicit solution
of a corresponding dynamic programming optimization problem. A simple coding
scheme is designed based on the principle of posterior matching, which was
introduced by Shayevitz and Feder for memoryless channels. The posterior
matching scheme for our input-constrained setting is shown to achieve capacity
using two new ideas: \textit{message history}, which captures the memory
embedded in the setting, and \textit{message splitting}, which eases the
analysis of the scheme. Additionally, in the special case of an S-channel, we
give a very simple zero-error coding scheme that is shown to achieve capacity.
For the input-constrained BSC, we show using our capacity formula that feedback
increases capacity when the cross-over probability is small.

plane with root mean square thickness of only 101 kpc despite a widest extent
of nearly 3 Mpc, much larger than the conventional virial radius of the Milky
Way (MW) or M31. This plane passes within ${\sim 70}$ kpc of the MW-M31
barycentre and is oriented so the MW-M31 line is inclined by $16^\circ$ to it.
  We develop a toy model to constrain the scenario whereby a past MW-M31 flyby
in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) forms tidal dwarf galaxies that settle
into the recently discovered planes of satellites around the MW and M31. The
scenario is viable only for a particular MW-M31 orbital plane. This roughly
coincides with the plane of LG dwarfs with anomalously high RVs.
  Using a restricted $N$-body simulation of the LG in MOND, we show how the
once fast-moving MW and M31 gravitationally slingshot test particles outwards
at high speeds. The most distant such particles preferentially lie within the
MW-M31 orbital plane, probably because the particles ending up with the highest
RVs are those flung out almost parallel to the motion of the perturber. This
suggests a dynamical reason for our finding of a similar trend in the real LG,
something not easily explained as a chance alignment of galaxies with an
isotropic or mildly flattened distribution (probability $= {0.0015}$).

(EKG) equations for soliton stars made of real time dependent scalar fields.
These equations are non singular and satisfy flatness conditions asymptotically
with periodic time dependency. In this paper, we investigate the geodesic
motion of particles moving around an oscillaton related to a time dependent
scalar field. Bound orbital is found for these particles under the condition of
particular values of angular momentum L and initial radial position. We discuss
this topic for an exponential scalar field potential which could be of the
exponential form with a scalar field and investigate whether the radial
coordinates of such particles oscillate in time or not and thereby we could
predict the corresponding oscillating period as well as amplitude. It is
necessary to recall, in general relativity, a geodesic generalizes the notion
of a straight line to curved space time. Importantly, the world line of a
particle free from all external, non gravitational forces, is a particular type
of geodesic. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves
along a geodesic. In general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force
but a consequence of a curved space time geometry where the source of curvature
is the stress energy tensor (representing matter, for instance). Thus, for
example, the path of a planet orbiting around a star is the projection of a
geodesic of the curved 4D space time geometry around the star onto 3D space.

  stochastic differential equations through hypercomplexification",,,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We leverage commutative hypercomplex analysis to find closed-form solutions
of some systems of stochastic differential equations. Specifically, we obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions under which a system of stochastic
differential equations can be transformed into a scalar one involving processes
valued in a commutative hypercomplex. In the event the targeted scalar
stochastic differential equation is solved by quadratures, we recover the
solution of the original system by projecting the solution of the scalar
stochastic differential equation along the units of the underlying commutative
hypercomplex. The conversion of a system of stochastic differential equations
involving real-valued processes into a scalar one written in terms of
hypercomplex-valued processes is termed hypercomplexification. Both
hypercomplexification and its reverse are mediated by the analyticity of
stochastic differential equations data. They may be iterated in order to
generate higher-dimensional integrable systems of stochastic differential
equations and solve them. We showcase the utility of hypercomplexification by
treating several examples including linear, and linearizable systems of
stochastic differential equations and stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems.
Although we consider only random systems driven by white noises,
hypercomplexification is fundamentally algebraic, and it readily extends to
stochastic systems involving other types of disturbances.

criteria that supervoxels which fall on the same object should be closer than
those which fall on different objects, in the embedding space. We test on
unknown objects, which were not seen during training, and perform clustering in
the learned embedding space of supervoxels to effectively perform novel object
discovery. We validate the method with extensive experiments, quantitatively
showing that it can discover numerous unseen objects while being trained on
only a few dense 3D models. We also show very good qualitative results of
object discovery in point cloud data when the test objects, either specific

  Study of Sleep and Performance","Published in Proceedings of WWW 2017",,,,"cs.HC cs.CY cs.IR q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human cognitive performance is critical to productivity, learning, and
accident avoidance. Cognitive performance varies throughout each day and is in
part driven by intrinsic, near 24-hour circadian rhythms. Prior research on the
impact of sleep and circadian rhythms on cognitive performance has typically
been restricted to small-scale laboratory-based studies that do not capture the
variability of real-world conditions, such as environmental factors,
motivation, and sleep patterns in real-world settings. Given these limitations,
leading sleep researchers have called for larger in situ monitoring of sleep
and performance. We present the largest study to date on the impact of
objectively measured real-world sleep on performance enabled through a
reframing of everyday interactions with a web search engine as a series of
performance tasks. Our analysis includes 3 million nights of sleep and 75
million interaction tasks. We measure cognitive performance through the speed
of keystroke and click interactions on a web search engine and correlate them
to wearable device-defined sleep measures over time. We demonstrate that
real-world performance varies throughout the day and is influenced by both
circadian rhythms, chronotype (morning/evening preference), and prior sleep
duration and timing. We develop a statistical model that operationalizes a
large body of work on sleep and performance and demonstrates that our estimates
of circadian rhythms, homeostatic sleep drive, and sleep inertia align with
expectations from laboratory-based sleep studies. Further, we quantify the
impact of insufficient sleep on real-world performance and show that two
consecutive nights with less than six hours of sleep are associated with
decreases in performance which last for a period of six days. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of using online interactions for large-scale
physiological sensing.

combine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the
plasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood
function of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is
used to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of
B-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval
from the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This
approach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample
correlations from different studies by use of an approximated combined
likelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum
level of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this
approach.

mathematics may be useful in providing an explanation for the cosmological
constant problem. A connection between self-reference and consciousness has
been previously discussed due to their similar nature of making a reference to
itself. Vacuum observation has the property of self-reference and consciousness
in the sense that the observer is observing one's own reference frame of
energy. In this paper, the cyclical loop model of self-reference is applied to
the vacuum observation, such that the discrepancy between the energy density
resulting from the first part of the causal loop (i.e., the classical
irreversible computation of the observer's reference frame) and the other part
of the causal loop (i.e., nondeterministic quantum evolution) corresponds to
10^(123). This effectively provides a consistent explanation of the difference
between the observed and the theoretical values of the vacuum energy, namely,
the cosmological constant problem.

ground vibration in urban environments, all motivate designs of defence
structures to lessen the impact of seismic and ground vibration waves on
buildings. Low frequency waves, in the range $1$ to $10$ Hz for earthquakes and
up to a few tens of Hz for vibrations generated by human activities, cause a
large amount of damage, or inconvenience, depending on the geological
conditions they can travel considerable distances and may match the resonant
fundamental frequency of buildings. The ultimate aim of any seismic
metamaterial, or any other seismic shield, is to protect over this entire range
of frequencies, the long wavelengths involved, and low frequency, have meant
this has been unachievable to date.
  Elastic flexural waves, applicable in the mechanical vibrations of thin
elastic plates, can be designed to have a broad zero-frequency stop-band using
a periodic array of very small clamped circles. Inspired by this experimental
and theoretical observation, all be it in a situation far removed from seismic
waves, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve elastic surface (Rayleigh)
and body (pressure P and shear S) wave reflectors at very large wavelengths in
structured soils modelled as a fully elastic layer periodically clamped to
bedrock.
  We identify zero frequency stop-bands that only exist in the limit of columns
of concrete clamped at their base to the bedrock. In a realistic configuration
of a sedimentary basin 15 meters deep we observe a zero frequency stop-band
covering a broad frequency range of $0$ to $30$ Hz.
