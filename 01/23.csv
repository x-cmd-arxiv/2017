(including the strengths of 16 diffuse interstellar bands, DIBs) for a
well-chosen sample of single-cloud sightlines representing a broad range of
environmental conditions. Our analysis indicates that the majority ($\sim$93\%)
of the variations in the measurements can be captured by only four parameters
The main driver (i.e., the first principal component) is the amount of
DIB-producing material in the line of sight, a quantity that is extremely well
traced by the equivalent width of the $\lambda$5797 DIB. The second principal
component is the amount of UV radiation, which correlates well with the
$\lambda$5797/$\lambda$5780 DIB strength ratio. The remaining two principal
components are more difficult to interpret, but are likely related to the
properties of dust in the line of sight (e.g., the gas-to-dust ratio). With our
PCA results, the DIBs can then be used to estimate these line of sight
parameters.

  optimality of partial clique covering remains open",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial clique covering is one of the most basic coding schemes for index
coding problems, generalizing clique and cycle covering on the side information
digraph and further reducing the achievable broadcast rate. In this paper, we
start with partition multicast, a special case of partial clique covering with
cover number 1, and show that partition multicast achieves the optimal
broadcast rate of the multiple-unicast index coding if and only if the side
information digraph is partially acyclic. A digraph is said to be partially
acyclic if its sub-digraph induced by the vertex with maximum in-degree and its
incoming neighbors in the complementary digraph is acyclic. We further extend
to the general partial clique covering, offering sufficient conditions of its
optimality and sub-optimality with the aid of strong connectivity
decomposition. In addition, for some digraph classes, we also prove that the
optimal broadcast rate can be approximated by partial clique covering (as well
as by other basic schemes) within either a constant factor, or a multiplicative
factor of $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$, or $O(n^\epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon \in
(0,1)$.

classification problems, but there are not much evidences that it is also
effective for the image restoration or pixel-wise labeling problems. For image
restoration problems, the pooling is generally not used because the decimated
features are not helpful for the reconstruction of an image as the output.
Moreover, most deep learning architectures for the restoration problems do not
use dense prediction that need lots of training parameters. From these
observations, for enjoying the performance of inception-like structure on the
image based problems we propose a new convolutional network-in-network
structure. The proposed network can be considered a modification of inception
structure where pool projection and pooling layer are removed for maintaining
the entire feature map size, and a larger kernel filter is added instead.
Proposed network greatly reduces the number of parameters on account of removed
dense prediction and pooling, which is an advantage, but may also reduce the
receptive field in each layer. Hence, we add a larger kernel than the original
inception structure for not increasing the depth of layers. The proposed
structure is applied to typical image-to-image learning problems, i.e., the
problems where the size of input and output are same such as skin detection,
semantic segmentation, and compression artifacts reduction. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed network brings comparable or better results
than the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for these problems.

liquid is gapless to one- and two-electron excitations, while the strongly
paired state is gapped to the former and gapless to the latter. In contrast to
the case in which the wire is proximity-coupled to an external superconductor,
for an isolated wire there is no separate phase of a topological, weakly
paired, superconductor. Rather, this phase is adiabatically connected to the
Luttinger liquid phase. The properties of the one dimensional topological
superconductor emerge when the number of channels in the wire becomes large.
The quantum Hall states that may be formed by an array of single-channel wires

to estimate the random number of defective elements. n this paper, we
concentrate on testing the hypothesis $H_0$: the number of defectives $\le s_1$
against the alternative hypothesis $H_1$: the number of defectives $\ge s_2$.
We introduce a new decoding algorithm based on the comparison of the number of

order-optimal. Additionally, our simulation results verify the advantages of

problems with a focus on modern geometric optimal control tools and numerical
continuation techniques. Geometric optimal control is a theory combining
optimal control with various concepts of differential geometry. The ultimate
objective is to derive optimal synthesis results for general classes of control
systems. Continuation or homotopy methods consist in solving a series of
parameterized problems, starting from a simple one to end up by continuous
deformation with the initial problem. They help overcoming the difficult
initialization issues of the shooting method. The combination of geometric
control and homotopy methods improves the traditional techniques of optimal
control theory. A nonacademic example of optimal attitude-trajectory control of
(classical and airborne) launch vehicles, treated in details, illustrates how
geometric optimal control can be used to analyze finely the structure of the
extremals. This theoretical analysis helps building an efficient numerical
solution procedure combining shooting methods and numerical continuation.
Chattering is also analyzed and it is shown how to deal with this issue in
practice.

probabilistic behavior for complex systems. Compared with MDPs, POMDP models a
system more accurate but solving a POMDP generally takes exponential time in
the size of its state space. This makes the formal verification and synthesis
problems much more challenging for POMDPs, especially when multiple system
components are involved. As a promising technique to reduce the verification
complexity, the abstraction method tries to find an abstract system with a
smaller state space but preserves enough properties for the verification
purpose. While abstraction based verification has been explored extensively for
MDPs, in this paper, we present the first result of POMDP abstraction and its
refinement techniques. The main idea follows the counterexample-guided
abstraction refinement (CEGAR) framework. Starting with a coarse guess for the
POMDP abstraction, we iteratively use counterexamples from formal verification
to refine the abstraction until the abstract system can be used to infer the
verification result for the original POMDP. Our main contributions have two
folds: 1) we propose a novel abstract system model for POMDP and a new
simulation relation to capture the partial observability then prove the
preservation on a fragment of Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL); 2)
to find a proper abstract system that can prove or disprove the satisfaction
relation on the concrete POMDP, we develop a novel refinement algorithm. Our
work leads to a sound and complete CEGAR framework for POMDP.

of BiSb having buckled honeycomb lattice geometry, which is yet unexplored. The
phonon, room temperature molecular dynamics and elastic constant calculations
verify the dynamical and mechanical stability of the monolayer at 0~K and at
room temperature. The calculated electronic bandstructure reveals the direct
bandgap semiconducting nature of BiSb monolayer with presence of highly mobile
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) near Fermi-level. Inclusion of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) yields the giant Rashba spin-splitting of 2DEG near Fermi-level.
The calculated Rashba energy and Rashba splitting constant are 13 meV and 2.3
eV\AA, respectively. The strength of the Rashba splitting is amongst the
largest yet known 2D Rashba semiconductors. We demonstrate that the strength of
the Rashba spin-splitting can be significantly tuned by applying in-plane
bi-axial strain on the BiSb monolayer. Presence of the giant Rashba
spin-splitting together with the large electronic bandgap (1.6 eV) makes this
system of peculiar interest for optoelectronics applications. Furthermore, we
study the electronic properties of BiSb/AlN heterostructures having a lattice
mismatch of 1.3\% at the interface. Our results suggest that BiSb monolayer and
heterostructure systems could be potentially used to develop highly efficient
spin field-effect transistors, optoelectronics and nano-spintronics devices.
Thus, this comprehensive study of two-dimensional BiSb systems can expand the

  Tweets","6 pages, AAAI-17 preprint",,,,"cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting demographics of
geographic units given geotagged Tweets that are composed within these units.
Traditional survey methods that offer demographics estimates are usually
limited in terms of geographic resolution, geographic boundaries, and time
intervals. Thus, it would be highly useful to develop computational methods
that can complement traditional survey methods by offering demographics
estimates at finer geographic resolutions, with flexible geographic boundaries
(i.e. not confined to administrative boundaries), and at different time
intervals. While prior work has focused on predicting demographics and health
statistics at relatively coarse geographic resolutions such as the county-level
or state-level, we introduce an approach to predict demographics at finer
geographic resolutions such as the blockgroup-level. For the task of predicting
gender and race/ethnicity counts at the blockgroup-level, an approach adapted
from prior work to our problem achieves an average correlation of 0.389
(gender) and 0.569 (race) on a held-out test dataset. Our approach outperforms
this prior approach with an average correlation of 0.671 (gender) and 0.692
(race).

paper, we aim to predict city-wide shopping patterns. This is a challenging
task due to the sparsity of the available data -- over 60% of the city regions

another important view of human lifestyles, namely mobility patterns. With

model the relations between regions, we exploit spatial interactions in our
method. To that end, Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) with an interaction
regularization model is applied to fuse the data from multiple views or

baseline methods on two standard metrics. Our prediction results on multiple

speeds for electronic processing of data is of the same order as typical rates
for mmWave interfaces which makes the use of complex algorithms for tracking
channel variations and adjusting resources accordingly impractical. Our
proposed architecture integrates the RF and mmWave interfaces for beamforming
and data transfer, and exploits the spatio-temporal correlations between the
interfaces. Based on extensive experimentation in indoor and outdoor settings,
we demonstrate that an integrated RF/mmWave signaling and channel estimation
scheme can remedy the problem of high energy usage and delay associated with
mmWave beamforming. In addition, cooperation between two interfaces at the
higher layers effectively addresses the high delays caused by highly
intermittent mmWave connectivity. We design a scheduler that fully exploits the
mmWave bandwidth, while the RF link acts as a fallback mechanism to prevent
high delay. To this end, we formulate an optimal scheduling problem over the RF
and mmWave interfaces where the goal is to maximize the delay-constrained
throughput of the mmWave interface. We prove using subadditivity analysis that
the optimal scheduling policy is based on a single threshold that can be easily
adopted despite high link variations.

System F programs always map related inputs to related results. This paper
shows that Reynolds' theory can be seen as the instantiation at dimension 1 of
a theory of relational parametricity for System F that holds at all higher
dimensions, including infinite dimension. This theory is formulated in terms of
the new notion of a p-dimensional cubical category, which we use to define a
p-dimensional parametric model of System F for any p, where p is a natural
number or infinity. We show that every p-dimensional parametric model of System
F yields a split $\lambda$ 2-fibration in which types are interpreted as face
map- and degeneracy-preserving cubical functors and terms are interpreted as
face map- and degeneracy-preserving cubical natural transformations. We
demonstrate that our theory is ""good"" by showing that the PER model of
Bainbridge et al. is derivable as another 1-dimensional instance, and that all
instances at all dimensions derive higher-dimensional analogues of expected
results for parametric models, such as a Graph Lemma and the existence of
initial algebras and final coalgebras. Finally, our technical development
resolves a number of significant technical issues arising in Ghani et al.'s
recent bifibrational treatment of relational parametricity, which allows us to
clarify their approach and strengthen their main result. Once clarified, their

are equal. The SO accepts the proposed trade if no network constraint is
violated or curtails it until no violation occurs. Each proposed trade is
accepted or curtailed as it is presented. The SO also provides guidance to help
future proposed trades meet network constraints. The SO does not set prices,
and there is no requirement that different trades occur simultaneously or clear
at uniform prices. Indeed, there is no price-setting mechanism. However, if
participants exploit opportunities for gain, the trading process will lead to
an efficient allocation of energy and to the discovery of locational marginal
prices (LMPs). The great flexibility in the proposed trading process and the
low communication and control burden on the SO may make the process suitable
for coordinating producers and consumers in the distribution system.

in AI and complexity theory. Empirically and theoretically, many random CSPs
have been shown to exhibit a phase transition. As the ratio of constraints to
variables passes certain thresholds, they transition from being almost
certainly satisfiable to unsatisfiable. The exact location of this threshold
has been thoroughly investigated, but only for certain common classes of
constraints. In this paper, we present new bounds for the location of these
thresholds in boolean CSPs. Our main contribution is that our bounds are fully
general, and apply to any fixed constraint function that could be used to
generate an ensemble of random CSPs. These bounds rely on a novel Fourier
analysis and can be easily computed from the Fourier spectrum of a constraint
function. Our bounds are within a constant factor of the exact threshold
location for many well-studied random CSPs. We demonstrate that our bounds can
be easily instantiated to obtain thresholds for many constraint functions that
had not been previously studied, and evaluate them experimentally.

formulation of constructing such policies and identify conditions under which a

develop a practical design approach to safety-oriented stochastic controllers

can be used to minimize another cost function while ensuring safety in a
probabilistic way. However, an associated Bellman equation involves
infinite-dimensional minimax optimization problems since the disturbance
distribution may have a continuous density. To resolve computational issues, we
propose a duality-based reformulation method that converts the
infinite-dimensional minimax problem into a semi-infinite program that can be
solved using existing convergent algorithms. We prove that there is no duality
gap, and that this approach thus preserves optimality. The results of numerical
tests confirm that the proposed method is robust against distributional errors
in disturbances, while a standard stochastic safety specification tool is not.

only as a critical quantity for understanding elementary aspects of functional

This paper develops a new class of nonparametric covariance function estimators
in terms of various spectral regularizations of an operator associated with a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Despite their nonparametric nature, the
covariance estimators are automatically positive semi-definite without any
additional modification steps. An unconventional representer theorem is
established to provide a finite dimensional representation for this class of
covariance estimators, which leads to a closed-form expression of the
corresponding $L^2$ eigen-decomposition. Trace-norm regularization is
particularly studied to further achieve a low-rank representation, another
desirable property which leads to dimension reduction and is often needed in
advanced FDA approaches. An efficient algorithm is developed based on the
accelerated proximal gradient method. This resulted estimator is shown to enjoy
an excellent rate of convergence under both fixed and random designs. The
outstanding practical performance of the trace-norm-regularized covariance
estimator is demonstrated by a simulation study and the analysis of a traffic

the ring $\mathbb{Z}/2^k\mathbb{Z}$. More precisely, given a Boolean function
$F:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, define its $k$-lift to be $F_k:\{0,1\}^n
\rightarrow \{0,2^{k-1}\}$ by $F_k(x) = 2^{k-F(x)} \pmod {2^k}$. We consider
the fractional agreement (which we refer to as $\gamma_{d,k}(F)$) of $F_k$ with
degree $d$ polynomials from $\mathbb{Z}/2^k\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. Our
results are the following:
  - Increasing $k$ can help: We observe that as $k$ increases,
$\gamma_{d,k}(F)$ cannot decrease. We give two kinds of examples where
$\gamma_{d,k}(F)$ actually increases. The first is an infinite family of
functions $F$ such that $\gamma_{2d,2}(F) - \gamma_{3d-1,1}(F) \geq \Omega(1)$.
The second is an infinite family of functions $F$ such that
$\gamma_{d,1}(F)\leq\frac{1}{2}+o(1)$ -- as small as possible -- but
$\gamma_{d,3}(F) \geq \frac{1}{2}+\Omega(1)$.
  - Increasing $k$ doesn't always help: Adapting a proof of Green [Comput.
Complexity, 9(1):16-38, 2000], we show that irrespective of the value of $k$,
the Majority function $\mathrm{Maj}_n$ satisfies $\gamma_{d,k}(\mathrm{Maj}_n)
\leq \frac{1}{2}+\frac{O(d)}{\sqrt{n}}$. In other words, polynomials over
$\mathbb{Z}/2^k\mathbb{Z}$ for large $k$ do not approximate the majority
function any better than polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
  We observe that the model we study subsumes the model of non-classical
polynomials in the sense that proving bounds in our model implies bounds on the
agreement of non-classical polynomials with Boolean functions. In particular,
our results answer questions raised by Bhowmick and Lovett [In Proc. 30th
Computational Complexity Conf., pages 72-87, 2015] that ask whether
non-classical polynomials approximate Boolean functions better than classical
polynomials of the same degree.

of the WL emission, HXR peak, and evaporation flows indicate that the WL
emission was produced by accelerated electrons. To understand the white light
emission process, we calculated the energy flux deposited by non- thermal
electrons (observed by RHESSI) and compared it to the dissipated energy
estimated from a chromospheric line (Mg II triplet) observed by IRIS. The
deposited energy flux from the non-thermal electrons is about 3 ~ 7.7 X 10^(10)

thick target model. The energy flux estimated from the temperature changes in

to constrain physical parameters of the warm absorber outflow, we analyze the
archival data with the longest exposure taken by XMM-Newton in 2009. We
calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) spectra with the grating spectral
resolution for the first time. The RMS spectra have a sharp peak and several
dips, which can be explained by variable absorption features and non-variable
emission lines; a lower-ionized warm absorber (WA1: $\log\xi = 1.5,\,
v=-650\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$) shows large variability, whereas higher-ionized
warm absorbers (WA2: $\log\xi= 2.5,\,v=-4100\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$, WA3:
$\log\xi= 3.4,\, v=-6100\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$) show little variability. WA1
shows the maximum variability at a timescale of $\sim10^4$~s, suggesting that
the absorber locates at $\sim10^3$ times of the Schwarzschild radius. The depth
of the absorption features due to WA1 and the observed soft X-ray flux are
anti-correlated in several observational sequences, which can be explained by
variation of partial covering fraction of the double-layer blobs that are
composed of the Compton-thick core and the ionized layer ($=$WA1). WA2 and WA3
show little variability and presumably extend uniformly in the line of sight.
The present result shows that NGC 4051 has two types of the warm absorber

complex potential and conformal mapping. It is shown that a void with
hypocycloidal shape can lead to a higher SIF than that induced by a
corresponding star-shaped crack; this is counter intuitive as the latter
usually produces a more severe stress field in the material. Moreover, it is
observed that when the order $m$ of the polynomial governing the remote loading
grows, the stress fields generated by the hypocycloidal-shaped void and the
star-shaped crack tend to coincide, so that they become equivalent from the
point of view of a failure analysis. Finally, special geometries and loading
conditions are discovered for which there is no stress singularity at the
inclusion cusps and where the stress is even reduced with respect to the case
of the absence of the inclusion. The concept of Stress Reduction Factor (SRF)

well-known definition of Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) in the presence of
inclusions with smooth boundary. The results presented in this paper provide
criteria that will help in the design of ultra strong composite materials,
where stress singularities always promote failure. Furthermore, they will
facilitate finding the special conditions where resistance can be optimized in

informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the
possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical
theory, allowing a refoundation of the whole physics over logically solid
grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new
information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly
interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with
the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information
processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the
holographic principle (Susskind, J. Math. Phys. 36:6377, 1995; Bousso, Rev.
Mod. Phys. 74:825, 2002). In this paper I review how free quantum field theory
is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special
relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided
by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum
systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple
principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature
of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory
in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic
argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the observed regime is that of
small wavevectors ...

phonon-mediated carrier dynamics we are able to disentangle the influence of
excitation fluence, screening, and doping, and develop a microscopic picture of

of the test lies in the ""no-hair"" conjecture for black holes where all
properties of a black hole are characterised by the mass and the spin of the
black hole. The method relies on observationally measuring the quadrupole
moments of the compact binary constituents induced due to their spins. If the
compact object is a Kerr black hole (BH), its quadrupole moment is expressible
solely in terms of its mass and spin. Otherwise, the quadrupole moment can
depend on additional parameters (such as equation of state of the object). The
higher order spin effects in phase and amplitude of a gravitational waveform,
which explicitly contains the spin-induced quadrupole moments of compact
objects, hence uniquely encodes the nature of the compact binary. Thus we argue
that an independent measurement of the spin-induced quadrupole moment of the
compact binaries from GW observations can provide a unique way to distinguish
binary BH systems from binaries consisting of exotic compact objects.

matter setup is challenging due to the lack of an intrinsic three-fold
chirality of quasiparticles. We uncover two salient ingredients required to
express a three-component lattice Hamiltonian in a SU(3) format with
non-trivial topological invariant. We find that all three SU(3) components must
be entangled via a gauge field, with opposite chirality between any two
components, and there must be band inversions between all {\it three}
components in a given eigenstate. For spinless particles, we show that such
chiral states can be obtained in a tripartite lattice with three inequivalent
lattice sites in which the Bloch phase associated with the nearest neighbor
hopping acts as $k$-space gauge field. The second and a more crucial criterion
is that there must also be an odd-parity Zeeman-like term, i.e.
$\sin(k)\sigma_z$ term where $\sigma_z$ is the third Pauli matrix defined in
any two components of the SU(3) basis. Solving the electron-photon interaction
term in a periodic potential with a modified tight-binding model, we show that
such a term can be engineered with site-selective photon polarization. Such
site selective polarization can be obtained in multiple ways, such as using
Sisyphus cooling technique, polarizer plates, etc. With the $k$-resolved Berry
curvature formalism, we delineate the relationship between the SU(3) chirality,
band inversion, and $k$-space monopoles, governing finite Chern number without
breaking the time-reversal symmetry. The topological phase is affirmed by edge
state calculation, obeying the bulk-boundary correspondence.

Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology has already been characterized in terms
of radiation hardness to TID (Total Ionizing Dose) and charge collection after
a moderate neutron irradiation. In this article we present results of an
extensive irradiation hardness study with neutrons up to a fluence of 1x10e16
neq/cm2. Charge collection in a passive pixelated structure was measured by
Edge Transient Current Technique (E-TCT). The evolution of the effective space
charge concentration was found to be compliant with the acceptor removal model,
with the minimum of the space charge concentration being reached after 5x10e14
neq/cm2. An investigation of the in-pixel uniformity of the detector response
revealed parasitic charge collection by the epitaxial silicon layer
characteristic for the SOI design. The results were backed by a numerical
simulation of charge collection in an equivalent detector layout.

of UAVs in a formation flying setup. As the UAVs communicate to reach consensus
on their states while making the formation, the communication network among the
UAVs makes them vulnerable to a potential attack from malicious adversaries.
Two types of attacks pertinent to a network of UAVs have been considered: a
node attack on the UAVs and a deception attack on the communication between the
UAVs. UAVs formation control presented using a consensus algorithm to reach a
pre-specified formation. A node and a communication path deception cyber
attacks on the UAV's network are considered with their respective models in the
formation setup. For these cyber attacks detection, a bank of Unknown Input
Observer (UIO) based distributed fault detection scheme proposed to detect and
identify the compromised UAV in the formation. A rule based on the residuals
generated using the bank of UIOs are used to detect attacks and identify the
compromised UAV in the formation. Further, an algorithm developed to remove the
faulty UAV from the network once an attack detected and the compromised UAV
isolated while maintaining the formation flight with a missing UAV node.

systems with time-varying interactions remains unclear. In this work, we use
higher-order network models to extend the framework of structural

(i) correlations in the chronological ordering of interactions are an important
source of complexity that significantly influences the controllability of

via nonlinear thermo-optical tuning when the cavity-coupled optical pump is

thermal field, which influences the spatially overlapping optical modes,
allowing thus to alter the relative spectral separation of resonances.
Furthermore, we exploit such tunability to probe continuously the coupling
between different families of quasi-degenerate modes that exhibit asymmetric
Fano-interactions. As a particular case, we demonstrate for the first time a
complete disappearance of one of the modal features in the transmission
spectrum as predicted by U. Fano [Phys. Rev. 124, 1866 (1961)]. The phenomenon
is modeled as a third order non-linearity with a spatial distribution that
depends on the stored optical field and the thermal diffusion within the

agreement with the experimental results, which confirm the validity of the
developed theory.

Graphene-like porous membranes, but presenting larger porosity and potential

porous two-dimensional (planar) allotrope carbon, with its pores resembling

investigated the hydrogenation dynamics of BPC membranes under different

out an extensive study through fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations using the reactive force field ReaxFF, as implemented in the

observed in the case of graphene hydrogenation was also observed here. MD
results also show that under hydrogenation BPC structure undergoes a change in

hydrogenation can produce significant structural damages, with the formation of
large defective areas and large structural holes, leading to structural

variations. Frequent CSI acquisition may entail a large overhead whereas
infrequent CSI acquisition may result in a low CSI estimation quality. To cope
with these issues, we design codes which facilitate maximum likelihood sequence
detection at the receiver without instantaneous or statistical CSI. In
particular, assuming concentration shift keying modulation, we show that a
class of codes, referred to as strongly constant-weight (SCW) codes, enables
optimal CSI-free sequence detection at the cost of decreasing the data rate.
For the proposed SCW codes, we analyze the code rate and the error rate.
Simulation results verify our analytical derivations and reveal that the
proposed CSI-free detector for SCW codes outperforms the baseline coherent and

study of a bipolar rectifying nanopore using a continuum and a particle
simulation method. The common ground in the two methods is the application of
the Nernst-Planck (NP) equation to compute ion transport in the framework of
the implicit-water electrolyte model. The difference is that the
Poisson-Boltzmann theory is used in the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) approach,
while the Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo (LEMC) method is used in the particle
simulation approach (NP+LEMC) to relate the concentration profile to the
electrochemical potential profile. Since we consider a bipolar pore which is
short and narrow, we perform simulations using two-dimensional PNP. In
addition, results of a non-linear version of PNP that takes crowding of ions
into account are shown. We observe that the mean field approximation applied in
PNP is appropriate to reproduce the basic behavior of the bipolar nanopore
(e.g., rectification) for varying parameters of the system (voltage, surface
charge, electrolyte concentration, and pore radius). We present current data
that characterize the nanopore's behavior as a device, as well as
concentration, electrical potential, and electrochemical potential profiles.

show that given an efficient MAC code for disjunction computation the algorithm
requires $O(k \log (\frac{N}{k }))$ decision steps for detecting $k$ active

a class of MACs with arbitrarily varying sub-gaussian noise that uniformly
requires $O (k \log (N) \max \{ \log k , \log \log N \} )$ channel uses for

presented by Bouten and van Handel (L. Bouten, R. van Handel, ""On the
separation principle of quantum control"", in Quantum Stochastics and
Information: Statistics, Filtering and Control, World Scientific, 2008) and
develop a general theory of quantum feedback. We elucidate the relationship
between the controlling processes $Z$ and the measured process $Y$, and to this
end make a distinction between what we call the input picture and the output
picture. We should that the input-output relations for the noise fields have
additional terms not present in the standard theory, but that the relationship
between the control processes and measured processes themselves are internally
consistent - we do this for the two main cases of quadrature measurement and
photon-counting measurement. The theory is general enough to include a
modulating filter which processes the measurement readout $Y$ before returning
to the system. This opens up the prospect of applying very general engineering
feedback control techniques to open quantum systems in a systematic manner, and
we consider a number of specific modulating filter problems. Finally, we give a
brief argument as to why most of the rules for making instantaneous feedback

the vector innovations due to Kalman filtering via lattice quantization with
subtractive dither and memoryless entropy coding. This coding scheme provides a
tight upper bound to the zero-delay Gaussian RDF. We extend this result to
vector Gaussian AR sources of any finite order. Further, we show that for
infinite dimensional vector Gaussian AR sources of any finite order, the NRDF
coincides with the zero-delay RDF. Our theoretical framework is corroborated

has raised the question whether such large masses allow for the existence of
exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons, inside neutron stars. In the
present work we will investigate how the existing hypernuclei properties may
constrain the neutron star equation of state and confront the neutron star
maximum masses obtained with equations of state calibrated to hypernuclei
properties with the astrophysical $2\,M_\odot$ constraint.
  The study is performed using a relativistic mean field approach to describe
both the hypernuclei and the neutron star equations of state. A set of five
models consistent with $2\,M_\odot$ for a purely nucleonic composition are
employed. The $\Lambda$-meson couplings are determined for all the models
considered. Hyperonic stars with the complete baryonic octet are studied,
restricting the coupling of the $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ hyperons to the $\omega-$,
$\rho-$ and $\sigma-$mesons due to the lack of experimental data, and maximum
star masses calculated for unified equations of state. We conclude that the
currently available hypernuclei experimental data and the lack of constraints
on the asymmetric equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities do not
allow to further constrain the neutron star matter equation of state using the
recent $2\, M_\odot$ observations. It is also shown that the $\Lambda$
potential in symmetric nuclear matter takes a value $\sim 30-32$ MeV at
saturation for the $g_{\omega \Lambda}$ coupling given by the SU(6) symmetry,
close to values generally used in the literature. However, the $\Lambda$
potential in $\Lambda$ matter varies between -16 and -8 MeV taking for vector
mesons couplings the SU(6) values, at variance with generally employed values
between $-1$ and $-5$ MeV.

  Quantum Computation and Applications","32 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weighted counting problems are a natural generalization of counting problems
where a weight is associated with every computational path of polynomial-time
non-deterministic Turing machines and the goal is to compute the sum of the
weights of all paths (instead of just computing the number of accepting paths).
Useful closure properties and plenty of applications make weighted counting
problems interesting. The general definition of these problems captures even
undecidable problems, but it turns out that obtaining an exponentially small
additive approximation is just as hard as solving conventional counting
problems. In many cases such an approximation is sufficient and working with
weighted counting problems tends to be very convenient. We present a structured
view on weighted counting by defining classes that depend on the range of the
function that assigns weights to paths and by showing the relationships between
these different classes. These classes constitute generalizations of the usual
counting problems. Weighted counting allows us to easily cast a number of
famous results of computational complexity in its terms, especially regarding
counting and quantum computation. Moreover, these classes are flexible enough
and capture the complexity of various problems in fields such as probabilistic
graphical models and stochastic combinatorial optimization. Using the weighted

in two sub-problems corresponding to two objectives: First, the number of

be modeled as packing the tests into configurations, and we introduce a set of
implied constraints to improve the lower bound of the model. Second, tests must
be sequenced so that the number of times an equipment unit has to be switched

a buffer with limited capacity represents the currently active equipment units,

Keck/NIRC2 instrument at L band. Reaching the optimal performance of the
coronagraph requires fine control of the wavefront incident on the phase mask.
In particular, centering errors can lead to significant stellar light leakage
that degrades the contrast performance and prevents the observation of faint
planetary companions around the observed stars. It is thus critical to correct
for the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center,
generally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity
field variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil
tracking mode. A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex
coronagraph has thus been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument.
This algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the
calibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center and
stabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. On-sky data show that
the QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4
mas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator
is probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot
stop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5
mas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed.
The QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust
method to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition,
QACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the
observing efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used
for vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and
angular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.

through a material in which it loses energy. The energy lost is then replaced

reduce the transverse emittance of the beam (transverse cooling). A major

Koszul duality between the Steenrod algebra and the big Dyer-Lashof algebra are
studied, with an emphasis on the interplay between instability for the Steenrod
algebra action and that for the Dyer-Lashof operations. The central algebraic
framework is the category of length-graded modules over the Steenrod algebra
equipped with an unstable action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra, with compatibility
via the Nishida relations.
  A first ingredient is a functor defined on modules over the Steenrod algebra
that arose in the work of Kuhn and McCarty on the homology of infinite loop
spaces. This functor is given in terms of derived functors of destabilization
from the category of modules over the Steenrod algebra to unstable modules,
enriched by taking into account the action of Dyer-Lashof operations.
  A second ingredient is the derived functors of the Dyer-Lashof
indecomposables functor to length-graded modules over the Steenrod algebra.
These are related to functors used by Miller in his study of a spectral
sequence to calculate the homology of an infinite delooping. An important fact
is that these functors can be calculated as the homology of an explicit Koszul
complex with terms expressed as certain Steinberg functors. The latter are
quadratic dual to the more familiar Singer functors.
  By exploiting the explicit complex built from the Singer functors which
calculates the derived functors of destabilization, Koszul duality leads to an
algebraic infinite delooping spectral sequence. This is conceptually similar to
Miller's spectral sequence, but there seems to be no direct relationship.
  The spectral sequence sheds light on the relationship between unstable
modules over the Steenrod algebra and all modules.

remnants Cas A and HESS J1731-347 are well fit with carbon atmosphere models.
These fits yield plausible neutron star sizes for the known or estimated
distances to these supernova remnants. The evidence in favor of the presence of
a pure carbon envelope at the neutron star surface is rather indirect and is
based on the assumption that the emission is generated uniformly by the entire
stellar surface. Although this assumption is supported by the absence of
pulsations, the observational upper limit on the pulsed fraction is not very
stringent. In an attempt to quantify this evidence, we investigate the
possibility that the observed spectrum of the neutron star in HESS J1731-347 is
a combination of the spectra produced in a hydrogen atmosphere of the hotspots
and of the cooler remaining part of the neutron star surface. The lack of
pulsations in this case has to be explained either by a sufficiently small
angle between the neutron star spin axis and the line of sight, or by a
sufficiently small angular distance between the hotspots and the neutron star
rotation poles. As the observed flux from a non-uniformly emitting neutron star
depends on the angular distribution of the radiation emerging from the
atmosphere, we have computed two new grids of pure carbon and pure hydrogen
atmosphere model spectra accounting for Compton scattering. Using new hydrogen
models, we have evaluated the probability of a geometry that leads to a pulsed
fraction below the observed upper limit to be about 8.2 %. Such a geometry thus
seems to be rather improbable but cannot be excluded at this stage.

NeuroClusters have a modular design based on NeuroStream coprocessors (for
Convolution-intensive computations) and general-purpose RISCV cores. In
addition, a DRAM-friendly tiling mechanism and a scalable computation paradigm
are presented to efficiently harness this computational capability with a very
low programming effort. NeuroCluster occupies only 8% of the total logic-base

with 22.5 GFLOPS/W energy-efficiency which is 3.5X better than the best GPU
implementations in similar technologies. The minor increase in system-level

flux patches in the trailing region. During the pore formation, the ratio
between magnetic and dark area decreases from 5 to 2. We observe strong
downflows at the forming pore boundary and diverging proper motions of plasma

pore. The average values and trends of the various quantities estimated in the
AR are in agreement with results of former observational studies of steady

function is a function defined on a B-spline domain, whose graph surface also
has a B-spline representation. We consider constructions along one interface
between two patches. We restrict ourselves to a special case of planar B-spline
patches of bidegree (p,p) with $p \geq 3$, so-called analysis-suitable $G^1$
geometries, which are derived from a specific geometric continuity condition.
This class of two-patch geometries is exactly the one which allows, under
certain additional assumptions, $C^1$ isogeometric spaces with optimal
approximation properties (Collin et al., 2016).
  Such spaces are of interest when solving numerically fourth-order PDE
problems, such as the biharmonic equation, using the isogeometric method. In
particular, we analyze the dimension of the $C^1$-smooth isogeometric space and
present an explicit representation for a basis of this space. Both the
dimension of the space and the basis functions along the common interface
depend on the considered two-patch parameterization. Such an explicit, geometry
dependent basis construction is important for an efficient implementation of
the isogeometric method. The stability of the constructed basis is numerically
confirmed for an example configuration.

Human communication is primarily based on symbolic abstractions of object
properties, rather than precise quantitative measures. A comprehensive robotic
framework thus requires an integrated communication module which is able to
establish a link and convert between perceptual and abstract information.
  The ability to interpret composite symbolic descriptions enables an
autonomous agent to a) operate in unstructured and cluttered environments, in
tasks which involve unmodeled or never seen before objects; and b) exploit the
aggregation of multiple symbolic properties as an instance of ensemble
learning, to improve identification performance even when the individual
predicates encode generic information or are imprecisely grounded.
  We propose a discriminative probabilistic model which interprets symbolic
descriptions to identify the referent object contextually w.r.t.\ the structure

urgent issues to exploit thermonuclear explosions of accreted White Dwarfs

the progenitor system metallicity on the physical and chemical properties of
the WD at the explosion epoch. We analyze the evolution of CO WDs through the
accretion and simmering phases by using evolutionary models based on
time-dependent convective mixing and an extended nuclear network including the
most important electron captures, beta decays and URCA processes. We find that,
due to URCA processes and electron-captures, the neutron excess and density at
which the thermal runaway occurs are substantially larger than previously
claimed. Moreover, we find that the higher the progenitor metallicity, the
larger the neutron excess variation during the accretion and simmering phases
and the higher the central density and the convective velocity at the
explosion. Hence, the simmering phase acts as an amplifier of the differences
existing in SNe Ia progenitors. When applying our results to the neutron excess
estimated for the Tycho and Kepler young Supernova remnants, we derive that the
metallicity of the progenitors should be in the range Z=0.030-0.032, close to
the average metallicity value of the thin disk of the Milky Way. As the amount
of ${^{56}}$Ni produced in the explosion depends on the neutron excess and
central density at the thermal runaway, our results suggest that the light

UT using joint observations made by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer
(IRIS) and the Hinode Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). Spectral
lines providing coverage of the solar atmosphere from chromosphere to the

results of the investigation have revealed evidence of strongly blue-shifted
plasma flows, with velocities up to 200 km/s, being observed 40 minutes prior
to flaring. These flows are located along the filament present in the active
region and are both spatially discrete and transient. In order to constrain the
possible explanations for this activity, we undertake non-potential magnetic
field modelling of the active region. This modelling indicates the existence of
a weakly twisted flux rope along the polarity inversion line in the region
where a filament and the strong pre-flare flows are observed. We then discuss
how these observations relate to the current models of flare triggering. We
conclude that the most likely drivers of the observed activity are internal
reconnection in the flux rope, early onset of the flare reconnection, or tether
cutting reconnection along the filament.

M. Pugno, and P. Scardi (LRPS) [J. Appl. Phys. 117, 164304 (2015)] on Pd <011>
cylindrical nanowires containing an axial screw dislocation. Indeed, according
to our previous study [Phys. Rev. B 88, 224101 (2013)], the axial displacement
field along the nanowire exhibits both a radial and an azimuthal dependence
with a twofold symmetry due the <011> orientation. As a consequence, the
deviatoric strain term used by LRPS is not suitable to analyze the anisotropic
strain fields that should be observed in their atomistic simulations. In this
comment, we first illustrate the importance of anisotropy in <011> Pd nanowire
by calculating the azimuthal dependence of the deviatoric strain term. Then the
expression of the anisotropic elastic field is recalled in term of strain
tensor components to show that image fields should be also considered. The
other aspect of this comment concerns the supposedly loss of correlation along
the nanorod caused by the twist. It is claimed for instance by LRPS that : ""As
an effect of the dislocation strain and twist, if the cylinder is long enough,
upper/lower regions tend to lose correlation, as if the rod were made of
different sub-domains."". This assertion appears to us misleading since for any
twist the position of all the atoms in the nanorod is perfectly defined and
therefore prevents any loss of correlation. To clarify this point, it should be
specified that this apparent loss of correlation can not be ascribed to the
twisted state of the nanowire but is rather due to a limitation of the X-ray
powder diffraction. Considering for instance coherent X-ray diffraction, we
show an example of high twist where the simulated diffractogram presents a
clear signature of the perfect correlation.

model that takes into account the stochastic variability of the formation of
bonds, and the influence of the cell velocity on the binding dynamics: the
faster the cell goes, the more likely existing bonds are to disassemble. The
model is based on a nonlinear birth-and-death-like dynamics, in the spirit of
Joffe and Metivier (1986); Ethier and Kurtz (2009). We prove that, under
different scaling regimes, the cell velocity follows either an ordinary
differential equation or a stochastic differential equation, that we both
analyse. We obtain both the identification of a shear-velocity threshold
associated with the transition from cell sliding and its firm adhesion, and the
expression of the cell mean stopping time as a function of its adhesive
dynamics.

  SAFE uses a simple linking abstraction to organize and share certificates

problems in secure and optimal operation of modern electricity markets. New
sources of uncertainties such as wind speed volatility and price-sensitive
loads impose additional challenges to this large-scale problem. This paper
proposes a new Stochastic SCUC using point estimation method to model the power
system uncertainties more efficiently. Conventional scenario-based Stochastic
SCUC approaches consider the Mont Carlo method; which presents additional
computational burdens to this large-scale problem. In this paper we use point
estimation instead of scenario generating to detract computational burdens of
the problem. The proposed approach is implemented on a six-bus system and on a
modified IEEE 118-bus system with 94 uncertain variables. The efficacy of
proposed algorithm is confirmed, especially in the last case with notable
reduction in computational burden without considerable loss of precision.

noncommutative differentials $d x^i$ on the algebra $k[x^1,\cdots,x^n]$ of
polynomials in $n$-variables over a field $k$ are classified by commutative
algebras $V$ on the vector space spanned by the coordinates. This data also
applies to construct differentials on the Heisenberg algebra `spacetime' with
relations $[x^\mu,x^\nu]=\lambda\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ where $ \Theta$ is an
antisymmetric matrix as well as to Lie algebras with pre-Lie algebra
structures. We specialise the general theory to the field $k={\ \mathbb{F}}_2$
of two elements, in which case translation invariant metrics (i.e. with
constant coefficients) are equivalent to making $V$ a Frobenius algebras. We
classify all of these and their quantum Levi-Civita bimodule connections for
$n=2,3$, with partial results for $n=4$. For $n=2$ we find 3 inequivalent
differential structures admitting 1,2 and 3 invariant metrics respectively. For
$n=3$ we find 6 differential structures admitting $0,1,2,3,4,7$ invariant
metrics respectively. We give some examples for $n=4$ and general $n$.
Surprisingly, not all our geometries for $n\ge 2$ have zero quantum Riemann
curvature. Quantum gravity is normally seen as a weighted `sum' over all
possible metrics but our results are a step towards a deeper approach in which
we must also `sum' over differential structures. Over ${\mathbb{F}}_2$ we
construct some of our algebras and associated structures by digital gates,
opening up the possibility of `digital geometry'.
