sufficiently high ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic transition
temperatures, and magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient at room
temperature, and thus it is highly sensitive to the impact of cross-influence
of applied electric and magnetic fields. According to the urgent demands of
nanotechnology miniaturization for ultra-high density data storage in advanced
nonvolatile memory cells, it is very important to reduce the sizes of
multiferroic nanoparticles in the self-assembled arrays without serious
deterioration of their properties. We study size effects of the phase diagrams,
FE and ME properties of semi-ellipsoidal BiFeO3 nanoparticles clamped to a
rigid conductive substrate. The spatial distribution of the spontaneous
polarization vector inside the nanoparticles, phase diagrams and
paramagnetoelectric (PME) coefficient were calculated in the framework of
modified Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach. Analytical expressions were
derived for the dependences of the FE transition temperature, average
polarization, linear dielectric susceptibility and PME coefficient on the
particle sizes for a general case of a semi-ellipsoidal nanoparticles with
three different semi-axes a, b and height c. The analyses of the obtained
results leads to the conclusion that the size effect of the phase diagrams,
spontaneous polarization and PME coefficient is rather sensitive to the
particle sizes aspect ratio in the polarization direction, and less sensitive
to the absolute values of the sizes per se.

different slow-roll inflation backgrounds. Spectator fields have a negligible
energy density during inflation but may play an important dynamical role later,
even giving rise to primordial density perturbations within our observational
horizon today. During de-Sitter expansion there is an equilibrium solution for
the spectator field which is often used to estimate the stochastic distribution
during slow-roll inflation. However slow roll only requires that the Hubble
rate varies slowly compared to the Hubble time, while the time taken for the
stochastic distribution to evolve to the de-Sitter equilibrium solution can be
much longer than a Hubble time. We study both chaotic (monomial) and plateau
inflaton potentials, with quadratic, quartic and axionic spectator fields. We
give an adiabaticity condition for the spectator field distribution to relax to
the de-Sitter equilibrium, and find that the de-Sitter approximation is never a
reliable estimate for the typical distribution at the end of inflation for a
quadratic spectator during monomial inflation. The existence of an adiabatic
regime at early times can erase the dependence on initial conditions of the
final distribution of field values. In these cases, spectator fields acquire
sub-Planckian expectation values. Otherwise spectator fields may acquire much
larger field displacements than suggested by the de-Sitter equilibrium
solution. We quantify the information about initial conditions that can be
obtained from the final field distribution. Our results may have important
consequences for the viability of spectator models for the origin of structure,

Unfortunately, sharing often gives rise to side channels that can be exploited

techniques for systematic reasoning about this interplay between security and
efficiency. In particular, there is no established way for quantifying security
properties of shared caches.
  In this paper, we propose a novel model that enables us to characterize

The amount of information that can be absorbed by a cache, and (2) the amount
of information that can effectively be extracted from the cache by an
adversary. We use our model to compute both quantities for common cache
replacement policies (FIFO, LRU, and PLRU) and to compare their isolation
properties. We further show how our model for information extraction leads to
an algorithm that can be used to improve the bounds delivered by the CacheAudit

spectra covering the Halpha and [N II] spectral lines for more than 400
galaxies. Using optical emission-line diagnostics, we identify a significant
number of galaxies hosting AGN, which tend to have high masses and a broad
range of morphologies. Moreover, within the environmental densities probed by
our study, we find no environmental dependence on the fraction of galaxies
hosting AGN. The analysis of the integrated Halpha emission shows that the
specific star formation rates (SSFRs) of a majority of the cluster galaxies are
below the field values for a given stellar mass. We interpret this result as
evidence for a slow decrease in the star formation activity of star-forming
galaxies as they fall into higher-density regions, contrary to some previous
studies which suggested a rapid truncation of star formation. We find that most
of the intermediate- and high-mass spiral galaxies go through a phase in which
their star formation is suppressed but still retain significant star-formation
activity. During this phase, these galaxies tend to retain their spiral
morphology while their colours become redder. The presence of this type of
galaxies in high density regions indicates that the physical mechanism
responsible for suppressing star-formation affects mainly the gas component of
the galaxies, suggesting that ram-pressure stripping or starvation are
potentially responsible.

Recent field trial results and theoretical studies of the performance of CoMP
schemes revealed, however, that their gains are not as high as initially
expected, despite their large coordination overhead. In this paper, we review
recent advanced Coordinated Beamforming (CB) schemes, a special family of CoMP

optical aberrations, and other imperfections that make image processing for
human viewing and higher-level perception tasks challenging. Conventional
cameras address this problem by compartmentalizing imaging from high-level task
processing. As such, conventional imaging involves processing the RAW sensor
measurements in a sequential pipeline of steps, such as demosaicking,
denoising, deblurring, tone-mapping and compression. This pipeline is optimized
to obtain a visually pleasing image. High-level processing, on the other hand,
involves steps such as feature extraction, classification, tracking, and
fusion. While this siloed design approach allows for efficient development, it
also dictates compartmentalized performance metrics, without knowledge of the
higher-level task of the camera system. For example, today's demosaicking and
denoising algorithms are designed using perceptual image quality metrics but
not with domain-specific tasks such as object detection in mind. We propose an
end-to-end differentiable architecture that jointly performs demosaicking,
denoising, deblurring, tone-mapping, and classification. The architecture
learns processing pipelines whose outputs differ from those of existing ISPs
optimized for perceptual quality, preserving fine detail at the cost of
increased noise and artifacts. We demonstrate on captured and simulated data
that our model substantially improves perception in low light and other
challenging conditions, which is imperative for real-world applications.
Finally, we found that the proposed model also achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy when optimized for image reconstruction in low-light conditions,
validating the architecture itself as a potentially useful drop-in network for
reconstruction and analysis tasks beyond the applications demonstrated in this

noise. We also consider the possibility of grain boundaries as gate-switchable
spin filters, a functionality enabled by counterpropagating transport channels
laterally confined in the grain boundary.

(e.g., max-min problems) in wireless networks as a function of the power budget
$\bar{p}$ available to transmitters. Special focus is devoted to the utility
and the transmit energy efficiency (i.e., utility over transmit power) of the
solution. Briefly, we show tight bounds for the general class of network
utility optimization problems that can be solved by computing conditional
eigenvalues of standard interference mappings. The proposed bounds, which are
based on the concept of asymptotic functions, are simple to compute, provide us
with good estimates of the performance of networks for any value of $\bar{p}$
in many real-world applications, and enable us to determine points in which
networks move from a noise limited regime to an interference limited regime.
Furthermore, they also show that the utility and the transmit energy efficiency
scales as $\Theta(1)$ and $\Theta(1/\bar{p})$, respectively, as
$\bar{p}\to\infty$.

efficient process. The impact of including this process into gas-grain chemical
models entirely depends on the formalism used and the associated parameters.
Among these parameters, binding energies are probably the most uncertain ones
for the moment. We propose a new model to compute binding energy of species to
water ice surfaces. We have also compared the model results using either the
new chemical desorption model proposed by Minissale et al. (2016) or the one of
Garrod et al. (2007). The new binding energies have a strong impact on the
formation of complex organic molecules. In addition, the new chemical
desorption model from Minissale produces a much smaller desorption of these
species and also of methanol. Combining the two effects, the abundances of
CH3OH and COMs observed in cold cores cannot be reproduced by astrochemical
models anymore.

Our results suggest that, contrary to the numerous reports by other authors, no

graphite oxide, develops if they remain in concentrated acid. Furthermore, it
also appears that, depending on the concentration, sulfuric acid molecules
significantly weaken graphene-graphene interactions in graphite. Consequently,
concentrated sulfuric acid may be a good solvent for graphene dispersions, if

multiple state preparations and multiple measurement device settings we are
able to detect if there are any correlated errors between them, and are also
able to determine which state preparations are correlated with which
measurements. This is accomplished by going around a 'loop' in parameter space,
which allows us to check for self-consistency. No assumptions are made

the dimensions of the states and the positive-operator-valued measures (POVM)

the basic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) have received
little attention. The difficulty is that it is a non-concave maximization
problem, and such functions are notoriously difficult to understand in high

both the local and global geometry of the expected log-likelihood function. We
prove several rates of convergence for the MLE and give a complete

  Multi-Dimensional Modeling and Decomposition",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The energy efficiency of future networks is becoming a significant and urgent
issue, calling for greener network designs. At the same time, rapid development
of wireless networks shows a trend of increasing complexity in network
structure and resource space, leading to that optimizing the energy efficiency
of such networks requires a joint solution over multi-dimensional resource
space. However, the coupled resource dimensions and growing problem scales
bring great challenges in obtaining the optimal solutions. In this paper, we
develop a multi-dimensional network model on the basis of tuple-links
associated with transmission patterns (TPs) and formulate the optimization
problem as a TP based scheduling problem which jointly solves transmission
scheduling, routing, power control, radio and channel assignment. In order to
tackle the complexity issues raised from coupled resource dimensions, we
propose a novel algorithm that decomposes the coupling scheduling and power
control by exploiting the delay column generation technique to recursively
solve a master problem for scheduling and a sub-problem for power allocation.
Further, we theoretically prove that the performance gap between the proposed
algorithm and the optimum is upper bounded by that for the sub-problem
solution, where the latter is derived by solving a relaxed version of the
sub-problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
multi-dimensional framework and the benefit of the proposed joint optimization
in improving network energy efficiency.

yields correct admittance spectra and elements ratings in the high-noise

the same spectral band and geographical area, in an uncoordinated and
asynchronous manner. It is widely accepted that using CP-OFDM, the waveform
used by most current communication systems, will make it difficult to achieve
this paradigm. Especially, CP-OFDM is not adapted for spectral coexistence
because of its poor spectral localization. Therefore, it has been widely
suggested to use filter bank based multi carrier (FB-MC) waveforms with
enhanced spectral localization to replace CP-OFDM. Especially, FB-MC waveforms
are expected to facilitate coexistence with legacy CP-OFDM based systems.
However, this idea is based on the observation of the PSD of FB-MC waveforms
only. In this paper, we demonstrate that this approach is flawed and show what
metric should be used to rate interference between FB-MC and CP-OFDM systems.
Finally, our results show that using FB-MC waveforms does not facilitate
coexistence with CP-OFDM based systems to a high extent.

storing massive amounts of data coming from various sources. Heterogeneity of
these data sources often means different data classes (types) exist in a DSS,
each needing a different level of quality of service (QoS). As a result,
efficient data storage and retrieval processes that satisfy various QoS
requirements are needed. This paper studies storage allocation, meaning how
data of different classes must be spread over the set of storage nodes of a
DSS. More specifically, assuming a probabilistic access to the storage nodes,
we aim at maximizing the weighted sum of the probability of successful data
recovery of data classes, when for each class a minimum QoS (probability of
successful recovery) is guaranteed. Solving this optimization problem for a
general setup is intractable. Thus, we find the optimal storage allocation when
the data of each class is spread minimally over the storage nodes, i.e. minimal
spreading allocation (MSA). Using upper bounds on the performance of the
optimal storage allocation, we show that the optimal MSA allocation approaches
the optimal performance in many practical cases. Computer simulations are also

After clustering
is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare
clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering
methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued
that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be
assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing
assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which
the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not
necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering
returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size
distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two
clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the
context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of
clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the
scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random
models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and
gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a
drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation
of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of
random clustering model should be carefully justified.

important for are plasma diagnostics. The most promising model of these
patterns is based on double plasma resonance instability, which generates
upper-hybrid waves, which can be then transformed into the zebra emission.
Aims. We aim to study in detail the double plasma resonance instability of hot
electrons, together with a much denser thermal background plasma. In
particular, we analyse how the growth rate of the instability depends on the
temperature of both the hot plasma and background plasma components. Methods.
We numerically integrated the analysed model equations, using Python and
Wolfram Mathematica. Results. We found that the growth-rate maxima of the
upper-hybrid waves for non-zero temperatures of both the hot and background
plasma are shifted towards lower frequencies comparing to the zero temperature
case. This shift increases with an increase of the harmonic number s of the
electron cyclotron frequency and temperatures of both hot and background plasma
components. We show how this shift changes values of the magnetic eld strength
estimated from observed zebras. We confirmed that for a relatively low hot
electron temperature, the dependence of growth rate vs. both the ratio of the
electron plasma and electron cyclotron frequencies expresse distinct peaks, and
by increasing this temperature these peaks become smoothed. We found that in
some cases, the values of wave number vector components for the upper-hybrid
wave for the maximal growth rate strongly deviate from their analytical

excluded volume procedure to model repulsive interactions, and an arbitrary
density-dependent mean field to model attractive interactions. Variations on
the excluded volume mechanism include van der Waals (VDW) and Carnahan-Starling
models, while the mean fields are based on VDW, Redlich-Kwong-Soave,
Peng-Robinson, and Clausius equations of state. The VDW parameters of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction are fitted in each model to the properties of the
ground state of nuclear matter, and the following range of values is obtained:
$a = 330 - 430$ MeV fm$^3$ and $b = 2.5 - 4.4$ fm$^3$. In the context of the
excluded-volume approach, the fits to the nuclear ground state disfavor the
values of the effective hard-core radius of a nucleon significantly smaller
than $0.5$ fm, at least for the nuclear matter region of the phase diagram.
Modifications to the standard VDW repulsion and attraction terms allow to
improve significantly the value of the nuclear incompressibility factor $K_0$,
bringing it closer to empirical estimates. The generalization to include the
baryon-baryon interactions into the hadron resonance gas model is performed.
The behavior of the baryon-related lattice QCD observables at zero chemical
potential is shown to be strongly correlated to the nuclear matter properties:
an improved description of the nuclear incompressibility also yields an
improved description of the lattice data at $\mu = 0$.

(TIE-GCM). Using varying F10.7 flux values as a measurement of solar activity,
the models were run over a two-day period with the constant parameters Kp= 2,
n= 3 cm^3, and v= 400 km/s. Four F10.7 values (70, 110, 150, and 190) were
selected based off of the average F10.7 values for geomagnetic quiet days
across the current solar cycle. Our analysis of the model results showed that
solar activity has the greatest effect on TEC output and the least effect on
hmF2 and O/N2 output. Overall, TIE-GCM output tends to be higher than CTIPe,
however, inconsistent values across the two-day CTIPe v3.1 output suggests that
this model needs a longer warm-up period. When visually compared against
observed data, CTIPe v3.2 performs the best, although all models greatly
overestimated values for TEC. Analyses of models during geomagnetic quiet time
are important in establishing a baseline which can be compared against storm
data. An example of this was completed at the end of the study, using storm
data obtained from Millstone Observatory on March 17, 2013. In this analysis,
we found that TIE-GCM using the Weimer model to calculate the high-latitude

for the presence of thermal radio jets, and constrain the radio jet/wind flux
to at least 90 times lower than the expected value from the previously reported
bolometric luminosity-radio luminosity correlation. The emission at $>$29 GHz
may be dominated by the two spatially unresolved sources, which are located
immediately around FU Ori and its companion FU Ori S, respectively. Their
deconvolved radii at 33 GHz are only a few au. The 8-346 GHz SEDs of FU Ori and
FU Ori S cannot be fit by constant spectral indices (over frequency). The more
sophisticated models for SEDs suggest that the $>$29 GHz emission is
contributed by a combination of free-free emission from ionized gas, and
thermal emission from optically thick and optically thin dust components. We
hypothesize that dust in the innermost parts of the disks ($\lesssim$0.1 au)
has been sublimated, and thus the disks are no more well shielded against the
ionizing photons. The estimated overall gas and dust mass based on SED
modeling, can be as high as a fraction of a solar mass, which is adequate for
developing disk gravitational instability. Our present explanation for the
observational data is that the massive inflow of gas and dust due to disk
gravitational instability or interaction with a companion/intruder, was piled
up at the few au scale due to the development of a deadzone with negligible
ionization. The piled up material subsequently triggered the thermal and the
MRI instabilities when the ionization fraction in the inner sub-au scale region
exceeded a threshold value, leading to the high protostellar accretion rate.

constant $f$ couple to light instantons. The resulting large instantonic
corrections pose problems for natural inflation. We explore an alternative
argument based on the magnetic Weak Gravity Conjecture for axions, which we try
to make more precise. Roughly speaking, it demands that the minimally charged
string coupled to the dual 2-form-field exists in the effective theory. Most
naively, such large-$f$ strings curve space too much to exist as static
solutions, thus ruling out large-$f$ axions. More conservatively, one might
allow non-static string solutions to play the role of the required charged
objects. In this case, topological inflation would save the superplanckian
axion. Furthermore, a large-$f$ axion may appear in the low-energy effective
theory based on two subplanckian axions in the UV. The resulting effective
string is a composite object built from several fundamental strings and domain
walls. It may or may not satisfy the magnetic Weak Gravity Conjecture depending
on how strictly the latter is interpreted and on the cosmological dynamics of
this composite object, which remain to be fully understood. Finally, we recall
that large-field brane inflation is naively possible in the codimension-one
case. We show how string-theoretic back-reaction closes this apparent loophole
of large-$f$ (non-periodic) pseudo-axions.

Employing a dynamical approach, that rests on the role played by a new,
relevant physical scale - the transition radius - we provide a theoretical
calculation of the maximum mass achievable by a black hole seed that forms in
an isolated halo, one that scarcely merged. Incorporating effects at the
transition radius and their impact on the evolution of accretion in isolated
haloes we are able to obtain new limits for permitted growth. We find that
large black hole seeds ($M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^4 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$)
hosted in small isolated halos ($M_h \lesssim 10^9 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$)

established in isolated halos at high-$z$, but requires the occurrence of
mergers. Since the average limiting mass of black holes formed at $z \gtrsim

seen above a high optical depth mid-plane, so the disk's bulk clumpiness is not

the global stellar populations properties. We analyze the distribution of the
local average stellar-population ages of 654,053 sub-galactic regions resolved
on ~1-kpc scales in a volume-corrected sample of 394 galaxies, drawn from the
CALIFA-DR3 integral-field-spectroscopy survey and complemented by SDSS imaging.
We find a bimodal local-age distribution, with an old and a young peak
primarily due to regions in early-type galaxies and star-forming regions of
spirals, respectively. Within spiral galaxies, the older ages of bulges and
inter-arm regions relative to spiral arms support an internal age bimodality.
Although regions of higher stellar-mass surface-density, mu*, are typically
older, mu* alone does not determine the stellar population age and a bimodal
distribution is found at any fixed mu*. We identify an ""old ridge"" of regions
of age ~9 Gyr, independent of mu*, and a ""young sequence"" of regions with age
increasing with mu* from 1-1.5 Gyr to 4-5 Gyr. We interpret the former as
regions containing only old stars, and the latter as regions where the relative
contamination of old stellar populations by young stars decreases as mu*
increases. The reason why this bimodal age distribution is not inconsistent
with the unimodal shape of the cosmic-averaged star-formation history is that
i) the dominating contribution by young stars biases the age low with respect
to the average epoch of star formation, and ii) the use of a single average age
per region is unable to represent the full time-extent of the star-formation
history of ""young-sequence"" regions.

this class includes the cubic oscillator, symmetric double-well, symmetric

polarisation induced by conformal fields in an effective field theory approach.
We consider arbitrary conformal field theories, assuming only that the theory
contains a large number $N$ of fields in order to separate their contribution
from the one induced by virtual gravitons. The corrections are described in a
gauge-invariant way, classifying the induced metric perturbations around the de
Sitter background according to their behaviour under transformations on
equal-time hypersurfaces. There are six gauge-invariant modes: two scalar
Bardeen potentials, one transverse vector and one transverse traceless tensor,
of which one scalar and the vector couple to the spinning particle. The quantum
corrections consist of three different parts: a generalisation of the
flat-space correction, which is only significant at distances of the order of
the Planck length; a constant correction depending on the undetermined
parameters of the renormalised effective action; and a term which grows
logarithmically with the distance from the particle. This last term is the most
interesting, and when resummed gives a modified power law, enhancing the
gravitational force at large distances. As a check on the accuracy of our
calculation, we recover the linearised Kerr-de Sitter metric in the classical

most of the KOIs in these systems (176 out of 204) have nominal radii <6 R_E .
Each KOI in our sample was observed in at least 2 filters with adaptive optics,
speckle imaging, lucky imaging, or HST. Multi-filter photometry provides color
information on the companions, allowing us to constrain their stellar
properties and assess the probability that the companions are physically bound.
We find that 60 -- 80% of companions within 1"" are bound, and the bound
fraction is >90% for companions within 0.5""; the bound fraction decreases with
increasing angular separation. This picture is consistent with simulations of
the binary and background stellar populations in the Kepler field. We also
reassess the planet radii in these systems, converting the observed
differential magnitudes to a contamination in the Kepler bandpass and
calculating the planet radius correction factor, $X_R = R_p (true) / R_p
(single)$. Under the assumption that planets in bound binaries are equally
likely to orbit the primary or secondary, we find a mean radius correction
factor for planets in stellar multiples of $X_R = 1.65$. If stellar
multiplicity in the Kepler field is similar to the solar neighborhood, then
nearly half of all Kepler planets may have radii underestimated by an average
of 65%, unless vetted using high resolution imaging or spectroscopy.

between the divisor theory on chains of cycles and the corresponding tropical

of obstruction theories for logarithmic stable maps with the geometry of
Berkovich curves. To show the utility of these methods, we provide a short new
derivation of lifting for special divisors on a chain of cycles with generic
edge lengths, proved using different techniques by Cartwright, Jensen, and

distributions revealing a spatial sequence with distance from the illuminating
star. We explore the distinct morphology of the 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 micron PAH
bands and find that at least two spatially distinct components contribute to
the 7--9 micron PAH emission in NGC2023. We report that the PAH features behave
independently of the underlying plateaus. We present spectra of compact oval
PAHs ranging in size from C_66 to C_210, determined computationally using
density functional theory, and investigate trends in the band positions and
relative intensities as a function of PAH size, charge and geometry. Based on
the NASA Ames PAH database, we discuss the 7--9 micron components in terms of
band assignments and relative intensities. We assign the plateau emission to
very small grains with possible contributions from PAH clusters and identify
components in the 7--9 micron emission that likely originates in these
structures. Based on the assignments and the observed spatial sequence, we
discuss the photochemical evolution of the interstellar PAH family as they are
more and more exposed to the radiation field of the central star in the
evaporative flows associated with the PDRs in NGC2023.

1$. Numerical results, obtained by exact diagonalization, are in excellent
agreement with the analytical spectral density even for relatively small $N
\sim 8$. For $N \gg 1$ and not close to the edge of the spectrum, we find the
macroscopic spectral density simplifies to $\rho(E) \sim
\exp[2\arcsin^2(E/E_0)/\log \eta]$, where $\eta$ is the suppression factor of
the contribution of intersecting Wick contractions relative to nested
contractions. This spectral density reproduces the known result for the free
energy in the large $q$ and $N$ limit. In the infrared region, where the SYK
model is believed to have a gravity-dual, the spectral density is given by
$\rho(E) \sim \sinh[2\pi \sqrt 2 \sqrt{(1-E/E_0)/(-\log \eta)}]$. It therefore
has a square-root edge, as in random matrix ensembles, followed by an
exponential growth, a distinctive feature of black holes and also of low energy
nuclear excitations. Results for level-statistics in this region confirm the
agreement with random matrix theory. Physically this is a signature that, for
sufficiently long times, the SYK model and its gravity dual evolve to a fully
ergodic state whose dynamics only depends on the global symmetry of the system.
Our results strongly suggest that random matrix correlations are a universal
feature of quantum black holes and that the SYK model, combined with
holography, may be relevant to model certain aspects of the nuclear dynamics.

proposed as surface analogs for about two-thirds of all C-complex asteroids.
However, this suggestion appears to be inconsistent with the presence of
hydrated silicates on the surfaces of some of these asteroids including Ceres.
Here we report the presence of enstatite (pyroxene) on the surface of two
C-type asteroids (Ceres and Eugenia) based on their spectral properties in the
mid-infrared range. The presence of this component is particularly unexpected
in the case of Ceres because most thermal evolution models predict a surface
consisting of hydrated compounds only. The most plausible scenario is that
Ceres' surface has been partially contaminated by exogenous enstatite-rich
material, possibly coming from the Beagle asteroid family. This scenario
questions a similar origin for Ceres and the remaining C-types, and it possibly
supports recent results obtained by the Dawn mission (NASA) that Ceres may have
formed in the very outer solar system. Concerning the smaller C-types such as
Eugenia, both their derived surface composition (enstatite and amorphous
silicates) and low density suggest that these bodies accreted from the same
building blocks, namely chondritic porous, pyroxene-rich IDPs and volatiles
(mostly water ice), and that a significant volume fraction of these bodies has
remained unaffected by hydrothermal activity likely implying a late accretion.
In addition, their current heliocentric distance may best explain the presence
or absence of water ice at their surfaces. Finally, we raise the possibility
that CI chondrites, Tagish Lake-like material, or hydrated IDPs may be
representative samples of the cores of these bodies.

classification and regression.
  In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of

In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the

population structure determine evolutionary success, quantified by the
probability that a single mutant takes over a population. Graph structures,
compared to the well-mixed case, can act as amplifiers or suppressors of
selection by increasing or decreasing the fixation probability of a beneficial
mutant. Properties of the associated mean fixation times can be more intricate,
especially when selection is strong. The intuition is that fixation of a
beneficial mutant happens fast (in a dominance game), that fixation takes very
long (in a coexistence game), and that strong selection eliminates demographic
noise. Here we show that these intuitions can be misleading in structured
populations. We analyze mean fixation times on the cycle graph under strong
frequency-dependent selection for two different microscopic evolutionary update
rules (death-birth and birth-death). We establish exact analytical results for
fixation times under strong selection, and show that there are coexistence
games in which fixation occurs in time polynomial in population size. Depending
on the underlying game, we observe inherence of demographic noise even under
strong selection, if the process is driven by random death before selection for
birth of an offspring (death-birth update). In contrast, if selection for an
offspring occurs before random removal (birth-death update), strong selection
can remove demographic noise almost entirely.

the matrix depends on the number of pixels, the number of spherical harmonics,
the symmetries of the pixelization scheme and the presence of a mask. Taking
into account the above mentioned components, we provide analytical expressions
that constrain the rank of the matrix. They are obtained by expanding the
determinant of the covariance matrix as a sum of determinants of matrices made
up of spherical harmonics. We investigate these constraints for five different
pixelizations that have been used in the context of Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) data analysis: Cube, Icosahedron, Igloo, GLESP and HEALPix, finding that,
at least in the considered cases, the HEALPix pixelization tends to provide a
covariance matrix with a rank closer to the maximum expected theoretical value
than the other pixelizations. The effect of the propagation of numerical errors
in the regularity of the covariance matrix is also studied for different
computational precisions, as well as the effect of adding a certain level of
noise in order to regularize the matrix. In addition, we investigate the
application of the previous results to a particular example that requires the
inversion of the covariance matrix: the estimation of the CMB temperature power
spectrum through the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Finally, some
general considerations in order to achieve a regular covariance matrix are also
presented.

a transport equation for the specific vorticity (defined to be vorticity

purely on the spectrum and charges, so a model that satisfies them will do so

so-called separating degeneration limit of the two-loop diagram) is that the
one-loop cosmological constant must also be suppressed, by Bose-Fermi
degeneracy in the massless spectrum. We remark that theories of this kind, that

communication load. This coding framework is based on maximum distance
separable (MDS) codes of code length proportional to the number of rows of the

consisting of partitioning the matrix into submatrices and encoding each
submatrix using a shorter MDS code. We show that the assignment of coded matrix
rows to servers to minimize the communication load can be formulated as an
integer program with a nonlinear cost function, and propose an algorithm to
solve it. We further prove that, up to a level of partitioning, the proposed
scheme does not incur any loss in terms of computational delay (as defined by
Li et al.) and communication load compared to the scheme by Li et al.. We also
show numerically that, when the decoding time is also taken into account, the
proposed scheme significantly lowers the overall computational delay with
respect to the scheme by Li et al.. For heavy partitioning, this is achieved at
the expense of a slight increase in communication load.

convergent migration of two planets embedded in a disc. Depending on the
migration parameters, initial orbits and planets' masses the system may pass
through the resonance or enter it (permanently or temporarily). We illustrate
that a stable equilibrium of the averaged system (a periodic orbit of the
N-body model) is surrounded by the region of permanent resonance capture, whose
size depends on the migration parameters and the planets mass ratio. A system
located inside this region tends towards the equilibrium (the capture is
permanent), while a system located outside the region evolves away from the
equilibrium and leaves the resonance. We verify recent results of Delisle et
al. and Xu & Lai where they show that for $m_1 \lesssim m_2$ ($m_1, m_2$ are
the inner and outer planets' masses) the equilibrium is unstable when the
migration is added, so the capture cannot be permanent. We show that for
particular migration parameters the situation may be reversed (the equilibria
are unstable for $m_1 \gtrsim m_2$). We illustrate that 9:7 MMR consists of two
modes separated with a separatrix. The inner one is centred at the equilibrium
and the outer one has no equilibrium in its centre. A system located outside
the region of stable capture evolves from the inner into the outer mode. The
evolution occurs along families of periodic orbits of the averaged system, that
play a crucial role in the dynamics after the resonance capture.

that the chromatic polynomial $\chi(G;X)$ is #P-hard to evaluate for all but
three values X=0,1,2, where evaluation is in P. This dichotomy includes
evaluation at real or complex values, and has the further property that the set
of points for which evaluation is in P is finite. We investigate how the
complexity of evaluating univariate graph polynomials that arise from
CP-colorings varies for different evaluation points. We show that for some
CP-colorings (harmonious, convex) the complexity of evaluation follows a
similar pattern to the chromatic polynomial. However, in other cases (proper

dichotomy for evaluations at non-negative integer points. We also discuss some
CP-colorings where we only have very partial results.

on networks to explore how network structure affects dynamics. In this paper,
we incorporate the idea of \emph{synergy} into a two-state (""active"" or
""passive"") threshold model of social influence on networks. Our model's update
rule is deterministic, and the influence of each meme-carrying (i.e., active)
neighbor can --- depending on a parameter --- either be enhanced or inhibited
by an amount that depends on the number of active neighbors of a node. Such a
synergistic system models social behavior in which the willingness to adopt
either accelerates or saturates depending on the number of neighbors who have
adopted that behavior. We illustrate that the synergy parameter in our model
has a crucial effect on system dynamics, as it determines whether degree-$k$
nodes are possible or impossible to activate. We simulate synergistic meme
spreading on both random-graph models and networks constructed from empirical
data. Using a local-tree approximation, we examine the spreading of synergistic
memes and find good agreement on all but one of the networks on which we
simulate spreading. We find for any network and for a broad family of

semiconductors form ultra coherent two-level systems that are useful for
quantum information applications. Spins naturally have magnetic dipoles, so
alternating current (AC) magnetic fields are frequently used to drive spin
transitions and perform quantum gates. These fields can be difficult to
spatially confine to single donor qubits so alternative methods of control such
as AC electric field driven spin resonance are desirable. However, donor spin
qubits do not have electric dipole moments so that they can not normally be
driven by electric fields. In this work we challenge that notion by
demonstrating a new, all-electric-field method for controlling neutral $^{31}$P
and $^{75}$As donor nuclear spins in silicon through modulation of their
donor-bound electrons. This method has major advantages over magnetic field
control since electric fields are easy to confine at the nanoscale. This leads
to lower power requirements, higher qubit densities, and faster gate times. We
also show that this form of control allows for driving nuclear spin qubits at
either their resonance frequency or the first subharmonic of that frequency,
thus reducing device bandwidth requirements. Interestingly, as we relax the
bandwidth requirements, we demonstrate that the computational Hilbert space is
expanded to include double quantum transitions, making it feasible to use all
four nuclear spin states to implement nuclear-spin-based qudits in Si:As. Based
on these results, one can envision novel high-density, low-power quantum
computing architectures using nuclear spins in silicon.

are alleviated by restricting the search to stars with X-ray emission. Using
the X-ray point sources from the Massive Young star-forming complex Study in
Infrared and X-rays (MYStIX) survey of OB-dominated regions, we identify 98
MYStIX candidate OB (MOBc) stars by fitting their 1-8 micron spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) with reddened stellar atmosphere models. We identify 27
additional MOBc stars based on JHK photometry of X-ray stars lacking SED
fitting. These candidate OB stars indicate that the current census of stars
earlier than B1, taken across the 18 MYStIX regions studied, is less than 50%
complete. We also fit the SEDs of 239 previously-published OB stars to measure
interstellar extinction and bolometric luminosities, revealing six candidate
massive binary systems and five candidate O-type (super)giants. As expected,
candidate OB stars have systematically higher extinction than
previously-published OB stars. Notable results for individual regions include:
identification of the OB population of a recently discovered massive cluster in
NGC 6357; an older OB association in the M17 complex; and new massive luminous
O stars near the Trifid Nebula. In several relatively poorly-studied regions
(RCW 38, NGC 6334, NGC 6357, Trifid, and NGC 3576), the OB populations may
increase by factors of >2.

large datasets. The approach involves partitioning the regression input domain
into multiple local regions with a different local GP model fitted in each
region. Unlike existing local partitioned GP approaches, we introduce a
technique for patching together the local GP models nearly seamlessly to ensure
that the local GP models for two neighboring regions produce nearly the same
response prediction and prediction error variance on the boundary between the
two regions. This largely mitigates the well-known discontinuity problem that
degrades the boundary accuracy of existing local partitioned GP methods. Our
main innovation is to represent the continuity conditions as additional
pseudo-observations that the differences between neighboring GP responses are
identically zero at an appropriately chosen set of boundary input locations. To
predict the response at any input location, we simply augment the actual
response observations with the pseudo-observations and apply standard GP
prediction methods to the augmented data. In contrast to heuristic continuity
adjustments, this has an advantage of working within a formal GP framework, so
that the GP-based predictive uncertainty quantification remains valid. Our
approach also inherits a sparse block-like structure for the sample covariance
matrix, which results in computationally efficient closed-form expressions for
the predictive mean and variance. In addition, we provide a new spatial
partitioning scheme based on a recursive space partitioning along local
principal component directions, which makes the proposed approach applicable
for regression domains having more than two dimensions. Using three spatial
datasets and three higher dimensional datasets, we investigate the numerical
performance of the approach and compare it to several state-of-the-art
approaches.

collisions between heavy nuclei produce a state of matter with surprising fluid
properties. Non-central collisions have angular momentum on the order of
1000$\hbar$, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that
must be understood to properly describe the fluid. It is also of particular
interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum
chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of
strong vorticity. However, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in
heavy ion collisions have so far been found. Here we present the first
measurement of an alignment between the angular momentum of a non-central
collision and the spin of emitted particles, revealing that the fluid produced
in heavy ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. We
find that $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons show a positive
polarization of the order of a few percent, consistent with some hydrodynamic
predictions. A previous measurement that reported a null result at higher
collision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our new
observations, though with larger statistical uncertainties. These data provide
the first experimental access to the vortical structure of the ""perfect fluid""
created in a heavy ion collision. They should prove valuable in the development
of hydrodynamic models that quantitatively connect observations to the theory
of the Strong Force. Our results extend the recent discovery of hydrodynamic
spin alignment to the subatomic realm.

isotopic compositions which are considerably different from those of materials
in the Solar System. If some isotopes in presolar grains diffused out beyond
their grain sizes when they were embedded in parent bodies of meteorites, their
isotopic compositions could be washed out, and hence the grains cannot be
identified as presolar grains any more. We explore this possibility for the
first time by self-consistently simulating the thermal evolution of
planetesimals and the diffusion length of $^{18}$O in presolar silicate grains.
Our results show that presolar silicate grains smaller than $\sim$ 0.03 $\mu m$
cannot keep their original isotopic compositions even if the host planetesimals
experienced maximum temperature as low as 600 $^{\circ}$C. Since this
temperature corresponds to the one experienced by petrologic type 3 chondrites,
the isotopic diffusion can constrain the size of presolar silicate grains
discovered in such chondrites to be larger than $\sim$ 0.03 $\mu m$. We also
find that the diffusion lengths of $^{18}$O reach $\sim$ 0.3-2 $\mu m$ in
planetesimals that were heated up to 700-800 $^{\circ}$C. This indicates that,
if the original size of presolar grains spans a range from $\sim$ 0.001 $\mu m$
to $\sim$ 0.3 $\mu m$ like that in the interstellar medium, the isotopic
records of the presolar grains may be almost completely lost in such highly
thermalized parent bodies. We propose that isotopic diffusion could be a key
process to control the size distribution and abundance of presolar grains in

Network (F-RAN), whereby two edge-nodes (ENs) connected to a cloud server via
fronthaul links with limited capacity are serving the requests of $K_r$ users.
We consider all ENs and users are equipped with caches. A decentralized content
placement is proposed to independently store contents at each network node
during the off-peak hours. After that, we design a coded delivery scheme in
order to deliver the user demands during the peak-hours under the objective of
minimizing the normalized delivery time (NDT), which refers to the worst case
delivery latency. An information-theoretic lower bound on the minimum NDT is
derived for arbitrary number of ENs and users. We evaluate numerically the
performance of the decentralized scheme. Additionally, we prove the approximate
optimality of the decentralized scheme for a special case when the caches are
only available at the ENs.

between Massey products in $H^*(X,\rho)$ and Jordan blocks of $\phi_*$. Given a
non-zero complex number $\lambda$ define a representation
$\rho_\lambda:\pi_1(X)\to GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ as follows:
$\rho_\lambda(g)=\lambda^{\xi(g)}\cdot\rho(g)$. Denote by $J_k(\phi_*,
\lambda)$ the maximal size of a Jordan block of eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the

  The main result of the paper says that $J_k(\phi_*, \lambda)$ is equal to the
maximal length of a non-zero Massey product of the form $\langle \xi, \ldots ,
\xi, x\rangle$ where $x\in H^k(X,\rho)$ (here the length means the number of
entries of $\xi$). In particular, $\phi_*$ is diagonalizable, if a suitable
formality condition holds for the manifold $X$. This is the case if $X$ a
compact K\""ahler manifold and $\rho$ is a semisimple representation. The proof
of the main theorem is based on the fact that the above Massey products can be
identified with differentials in a Massey spectral sequence, which in turn can
be explicitly computed in terms of the Jordan normal form of $\phi_*$.

A fundamental question is how an anisotropy in the energy-band structure of the
carriers at zero magnetic field affects the properties of the interacting
particles at high fields, in particular of the composite fermions (CFs) and the
fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs). We demonstrate here tunable anisotropy
for holes and hole-flux CFs confined to GaAs quantum wells, via applying
\textit{in situ} in-plane strain and measuring their Fermi wavevector
anisotropy through commensurability oscillations. For strains on the order of
$10^{-4}$ we observe significant deformations of the shapes of the Fermi
contours for both holes and CFs. The measured Fermi contour anisotropy for CFs
at high magnetic field ($\alpha_\mathrm{CF}$) is less than the anisotropy of
their low-field hole (fermion) counterparts ($\alpha_\mathrm{F}$), and closely
follows the relation: $\alpha_\mathrm{CF} = \sqrt{\alpha_\mathrm{F}}$. The
energy gap measured for the $\nu = 2/3$ FQHS, on the other hand, is nearly
unaffected by the Fermi contour anisotropy up to $\alpha_\mathrm{F} \sim 3.3$,
the highest anisotropy achieved in our experiments.

proposed and used in practice in distributed storage systems (DSSs) such as
Windows Azure storage and Facebook HDFS-RAID. Theoretical bounds on the maximum
locality of LRCs ($r$) have been established. The \textit{average} locality of
an LRC ($\overline{r}$) directly affects the costly repair bandwidth, disk I/O,
and number of nodes involved in the repair process of a missing data block.
There is a gap in the literature studying $\overline{r}$. In this paper, we
establish a lower bound on $\overline{r}$ of arbitrary $(n,k,d)$ LRCs.
Furthermore, we obtain a tight lower bound on $\overline{r}$ for a practical
case where the code rate $(R=\frac{k}{n})$ is greater than
$(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})^2$. Finally, we design three classes of LRCs that
achieve the obtained bounds on $\overline{r}$. Comparing with the existing
LRCs, our proposed codes improve the average locality without sacrificing such

luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main sequence stellar evolution
tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and
evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily-spotted
weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of
radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new
methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot
temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed
from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum.
Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric
component $T_{\mathrm{hot}} \sim4100$ K and to a cool component
$T_{\mathrm{cool}} \sim2700-3000$ K, which covers $\sim80\%$ of the visible
surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the
spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band
strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy.
Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear
much younger and lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar
evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and
adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict
most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and
age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions starspots act as a
featureless veiling continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy
line-blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an
anti-correlation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.

intensity profile in each sector is reproduced with a 2D disk model. Our model
takes account of scattering and inclination of the disk as well as the
azimuthal dependence in intensity. When the dust is assumed to have the
conventional composition and maximum size of $1\ \mathrm{mm}$, the northwestern
region ($PA=329^{\circ}-29^{\circ}$) cannot be reproduced. This is because the
model intensity gets insensitive to the increase in surface density due to
heavy self-scattering, reaching its ceiling much lower than the observed
intensity. The ceiling depends on the position angle. When the scattering
opacity is reduced by a factor of $10$, the intensity distribution is
reproduced successfully in all the sectors including those in the northwestern
region. The best fit model parameters depend little on the scattering opacity
in the southern region where the disk is optically thin. The contrast of dust
surface density along $PA$ is derived to be about $40$, much smaller than the
value for the cases of conventional opacities ($70-130$). These results
strongly suggest that the albedo is lower than considered by some reasons at

combines cine- and tagged-MRI in order to provide both the anatomic reference

carried out to characterize the central tendencies and variations of motion

numerically characterized through the calculation of the free volumes, surface
areas, radial distribution functions, and structure factors. We found
particularly useful the potential energy dependence with $sp^3$ hybridization

phases were related to graphite-like, sponge-like, and unstable states. We
showed that our results are compatible with available experiments and different

  LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recognising individual trees within remotely sensed imagery has important
applications in forest ecology and management. Several algorithms for tree
delineation have been suggested, mostly based on locating local maxima or
inverted basins in raster canopy height models (CHMs) derived from Light
Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data or photographs. However, these algorithms
often lead to inaccurate estimates of forest stand characteristics due to the
limited information content of raster CHMs. Here we develop a 3D tree
delineation method which uses graph cut to delineate trees from the full 3D
LiDAR point cloud, and also makes use of any optical imagery available
(hyperspectral imagery in our case). First, conventional methods are used to
locate local maxima in the CHM and generate an initial map of trees. Second, a
graph is built from the LiDAR point cloud, fused with the hyperspectral data.
For computational efficiency, the feature space of hyperspectral imagery is
reduced using robust PCA. Third, a multi-class normalised cut is applied to the
graph, using the initial map of trees to constrain the number of clusters and
their locations. Finally, recursive normalised cut is used to subdivide, if
necessary, each of the clusters identified by the initial analysis. We call
this approach Multiclass Cut followed by Recursive Cut (MCRC). The
effectiveness of MCRC was tested using three datasets: i) NewFor, ii) a
coniferous forest in the Italian Alps, and iii) a deciduous woodland in the UK.
The performance of MCRC was usually superior to that of other delineation
methods, and was further improved by including high-resolution optical imagery.
Since MCRC delineates the entire LiDAR point cloud in 3D, it allows individual
crown characteristics to be measured. By making full use of the data available,
graph cut has the potential to considerably improve the accuracy of tree
delineation.

games in a distributed manner in which the players communicate with a set of
system nodes over noisy communication channels. The complexity of solving each
game class is defined as the minimum number of iterations required to find a
Nash equilibrium (NE) of any game in that class with $\epsilon$ accuracy.
First, we consider the class $\mathcal{G}$ of all $N$-player non-cooperative
games with a continuous action space that admit at least one NE. Using
information-theoretic inequalities, we derive a lower bound on the complexity
of solving $\mathcal{G}$ that depends on the Kolmogorov $2\epsilon$-capacity of
the constraint set and the total capacity of the communication channels. We
also derive a lower bound on the complexity of solving games in $\mathcal{G}$
which depends on the volume and surface area of the constraint set. We next
consider the class of all $N$-player non-cooperative games with at least one NE
such that the players' utility functions satisfy a certain (differential)
constraint. We derive lower bounds on the complexity of solving this game class
under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise models. Our result in the

the emission lines are produced in a circumstellar disk heated solely by the
photospheric radiation from the central star in order to test if the optical
and near-IR emission lines can be reproduced without invoking magnetospheric
accretion. The inner gaseous disk density was assumed to follow a simple
power-law in the equatorial plane, and we searched for models that could
reproduce observed lines of HI (H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$), HeI, CaII and FeII.
For the three stars, good matches were found for all emission line profiles
individually; however, no density model based on a single power-law was able to
reproduce all of the observed emission lines. Among the single power-law
models, the one with the gas density varying as $\sim 10^{-10}\,(R_{*}/R)^3\,
\rm g\,cm^{-3}$ in the equatorial plane of a 25 R$_{*}$ ($0.78$ AU) disk did
the best overall job of representing the optical emission lines of the three
stars. This model implies a mass for the H$\alpha$-emitting portion of the
inner gaseous disk of $\sim 10^{-9} M_*$. We conclude that the optical emission
line spectra of these HBe stars can be qualitatively reproduced by a
$\approx\,1$ AU, geometrically thin, circumstellar disk of negligible mass
compared to the central star in Keplerian rotation and radiative equilibrium.

exploit the contextual information -- have been shown to be effective in
solving sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. A common
assumption adopted in the literature is that the realized (ground truth) reward
by taking the selected action is observed by the learner at no cost, which,
however, is not realistic in many practical scenarios. When observing the
ground truth reward is costly, a key challenge for the learner is how to
judiciously acquire the ground truth by assessing the benefits and costs in
order to balance learning efficiency and learning cost. From the information
theoretic perspective, a perhaps even more interesting question is how much
efficiency might be lost due to this cost. In this paper, we design a novel
contextual bandit-based learning algorithm and endow it with the active
learning capability. The key feature of our algorithm is that in addition to
sending a query to an annotator for the ground truth, prior information about
the ground truth learned by the learner is sent together, thereby reducing the
query cost. We prove that by carefully choosing the algorithm parameters, the
learning regret of the proposed algorithm achieves the same order as that of
conventional contextual bandit algorithms in cost-free scenarios, implying
that, surprisingly, cost due to acquiring the ground truth does not increase
the learning regret in the long-run. Our analysis shows that prior information
about the ground truth plays a critical role in improving the system
performance in scenarios where active learning is necessary.

Our approach is robust and could be used to prove shock formation results for
other related systems with many unknowns and multiple speeds, in various

aspect of our framework is that it applies only to solutions in which the

that we encounter is that the geometric vectorfields that we use to commute the
equations are, by necessity, adapted to the wave operator of the

properties with the slow wave operator, much worse than their commutation
properties with a transport operator. To overcome this difficulty, we rely on a
first-order reformulation of the slow wave equation, which, though somewhat

  IEEE ISIT 2017. Several errors in the previous version of the proof are
  corrected",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a problem of sampling a Wiener process, with
samples forwarded to a remote estimator via a channel that consists of a queue
with random delay. The estimator reconstructs a real-time estimate of the
signal from causally received samples. Motivated by recent research on
age-of-information, we study the optimal sampling strategy that minimizes the
mean square estimation error subject to a sampling frequency constraint. We
prove that the optimal sampling strategy is a threshold policy, and find the
optimal threshold. This threshold is determined by the sampling frequency
constraint and how much the Wiener process varies during the channel delay. An
interesting consequence is that even in the absence of the sampling frequency
constraint, the optimal strategy is not zero-wait sampling in which a new
sample is taken once the previous sample is delivered; rather, it is optimal to
wait for a non-zero amount of time after the previous sample is delivered, and
then take the next sample. Further, if the sampling times are independent of
the observed Wiener process, the optimal sampling problem reduces to an
age-of-information optimization problem that has been recently solved. Our
comparisons show that the estimation error of the optimal sampling policy is
much smaller than those of age-optimal sampling, zero-wait sampling, and
classic uniform sampling.

biomarker-conditional efficacy may be identical in the completed trials and the
new setting, or at least informative enough to meaningfully bound this
quantity. Given a sample of this biomarker from the new population, we might
hope we can bridge the results of the completed trials to estimate the vaccine

conditional efficacy in the new population fails to identify the marginal
efficacy due to the unknown conditional unvaccinated risk. We define a curve
that partially identifies (lower bounds) the marginal efficacy in the new
population as a function of the population's marginal unvaccinated risk, under
the assumption that one can identify bounds on the conditional unvaccinated
risk in the new population. Interpreting the curve only requires identifying
plausible regions of the marginal unvaccinated risk in the new population. We

unique perspective for studies of Galactic cosmic-ray acceleration. Tycho's SNR
is a particularly good target because it is a young, type Ia SNR that is
well-studied over a wide range of energies and located in a relatively clean
environment. Since the detection of gamma-ray emission from Tycho's SNR by
VERITAS and Fermi-LAT, there have been several theoretical models proposed to
explain its broadband emission and high-energy morphology. We report on an
update to the gamma-ray measurements of Tycho's SNR with 147 hours of VERITAS
and 84 months of Fermi-LAT observations, which represents about a factor of two
increase in exposure over previously published data. About half of the VERITAS
data benefited from a camera upgrade, which has made it possible to extend the
TeV measurements toward lower energies. The TeV spectral index measured by
VERITAS is consistent with previous results, but the expanded energy range
softens a straight power-law fit. At energies higher than 400 GeV, the
power-law index is $2.92 \pm 0.42_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.20_{\mathrm{sys}}$. It
is also softer than the spectral index in the GeV energy range, $2.14 \pm
0.09_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.02_{\mathrm{sys}}$, measured by this study using
Fermi--LAT data. The centroid position of the gamma-ray emission is coincident
with the center of the remnant, as well as with the centroid measurement of
Fermi--LAT above 1 GeV. The results are consistent with an SNR shell origin of
the emission, as many models assume. The updated spectrum points to a lower
maximum particle energy than has been suggested previously.

haloes and relics in these clusters over the frequency range 80-1400 MHz; the
first such attempt to estimate their spectra at low frequencies. The spectra
follow a power law with a mean value of $\alpha = -1.13\pm0.21$ for haloes and
$\alpha = -1.2\pm0.19$ for relics where, $S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$. We
reclassify two of the cluster sources as radio galaxies. The low frequency
spectra are thus an independent means of confirming the nature of cluster
sources. Five of the nine clusters host radio haloes. For the remaining four
clusters, we place upper limits on the radio powers of possible haloes in them.
These upper limits are a factor of 2-20 below those expected from the $L_{\rm

implications of these limits to the hadronic model of halo emission are

remote control-flow alteration of programs with memory-safety vulnerabilities
continues to be a realistic threat. Guaranteeing that complex software is

Probabilistic countermeasures that depend on random secret keys are
interesting, because they are an inexpensive way to raise the bar for attackers
who aim to exploit memory-safety vulnerabilities. Moreover, some
countermeasures even support legacy systems. However, it is unclear how to
quantify and compare the effectiveness of different probabilistic
countermeasures or combinations of such countermeasures. In this paper we
propose a methodology to rigorously derive security bounds for probabilistic
countermeasures. We argue that by representing security notions in this setting
as events in probabilistic games, similarly as done with cryptographic security
definitions, concrete and asymptotic guarantees can be obtained against
realistic attackers. These guarantees shed light on the effectiveness of single
countermeasures and their composition and allow practitioners to more precisely
gauge the risk of an attack.

hydration on the morphology and transport characteristics of sulfonated
poly(ether ether ketone), sPEEK, membrane is investigated using atomistic
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at various hydration levels ({\lambda}:
number of water molecules per sulfonate group) between 4 and 15. At the
molecular level, the evolution of local morphology is investigated in terms of
structural pair correlations and minimum pair distances, and the transport
properties are studied in terms of mean squared displacements (MSDs) and
diffusion coefficients. The water-sulfur interaction in sPEEK is found to be
stronger than that in Nafion, as observed in experiments. As opposed to Nafion,
a weaker interaction of hydronium, with sulfonate, than water is observed. The
behavior of water in sPEEK membrane is found to remain far from bulk as
indicated by its diffusion coefficient. Analysis of simulation data indicate
that at low {\lambda}, the largest water cluster forms a narrow connected path
of water molecules and hydronium ions. With increasing {\lambda}, larger water
domains appear, spanning more than half of the simulation box at {\lambda} =
15. Small isolated clusters are present at all hydration levels, demonstrating
the extent of phase separation in sPEEK to be lesser than that in Nafion.
Various analyses, both at molecular and collective level, suggest the
occurrence of a percolation transition between {\lambda} = 8 and 10, which
leads to a connected network of water channels in the membrane, thereby
boosting the mobility of hydronium ions.

analysis or time-varying coefficient models which are unable to capture both
smooth and abrupt changes simultaneously. Emerging evidence suggests
state-related changes in brain connectivity where dependence structure
alternates between a finite number of latent states or regimes. Another
challenge is inference of full-brain networks with large number of nodes. We
employ a Markov-switching dynamic factor model in which the state-driven
time-varying connectivity regimes of high-dimensional fMRI data are
characterized by lower-dimensional common latent factors, following a
regime-switching process. It enables a reliable, data-adaptive estimation of
change-points of connectivity regimes and the massive dependencies associated
with each regime. We consider the switching VAR to quantity the dynamic
effective connectivity. We propose a three-step estimation procedure: (1)
extracting the factors using principal component analysis (PCA) and (2)
identifying dynamic connectivity states using the factor-based switching vector
autoregressive (VAR) models in a state-space formulation using Kalman filter
and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and (3) constructing the
high-dimensional connectivity metrics for each state based on subspace
estimates. Simulation results show that our proposed estimator outperforms the
K-means clustering of time-windowed coefficients, providing more accurate
estimation of regime dynamics and connectivity metrics in high-dimensional
settings. Applications to analyzing resting-state fMRI data identify dynamic
changes in brain states during rest, and reveal distinct directed connectivity
patterns and modular organization in resting-state networks across different
states.

plasma models based on ExB drift. Furthermore, we find that methods of
classifying the drift modes by means of $P_3$ measurements can sometimes
produce erroneous identifications in the presence of a changing drift rate. The

later rotation phases within the pulse window, which is inconsistent with the

with \emph{three} maxima instead of four. It was also shown that the
irreducible admissible region for the octupolar tensor in a three-dimensional

\emph{separatrix} surface connecting the two generic octupolar states. The

  Within expansions in non-integer bases we show that if

normal $\beta$-expansion. We also prove that if
$\beta\in(1,\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})$ then every $x\in(0,\frac{1}{\beta-1})$ has a

$\beta$-expansion with limiting frequency of zeros $p$, where $p$ is any real
number sufficiently close to $1/2$.
  For a class of planar self-affine sets we show that if the horizontal
contraction lies in a certain parameter space and the vertical contractions are
sufficiently close to $1,$ then every nontrivial vertical fibre contains an
interval. Our approach lends itself to explicit calculation and give rise to
new examples of self-affine sets with non-empty interior. One particular
strength of our approach is that it allows for different rates of contraction

important for understanding the establishment of complex gene regulation

flowering plants. However, the influence of these effects on gene expression
are difficult to quantify because they act simultaneously with cis-regulatory
mutations. Here we propose a simple method to decompose cis-regulatory (i.e.,
allelic genotype, AG), genomic imprinting (i.e., parent-of-origin, PO), and
maternal (i.e., maternal genotype, MG) effects on allele-specific gene
expression using RNA-seq data obtained from reciprocal crosses. We evaluated
the efficiency of method using a simulated dataset and applied the method to
whole-body Drosophila and mouse trophoblast stem cell (TSC) and liver RNA-seq
data. Consistent with previous studies, we found little evidence of PO and MG
effects in adult Drosophila samples. In contrast, we identified dozens and
hundreds of mouse genes with significant PO and MG effects, respectively.
Interestingly, a similar number of genes with significant PO effect were detect
in mouse TSCs and livers, whereas more genes with significant MG effect were
observed in livers. Further application of this method will clarify how these
three effects influence gene expression levels in different tissues and
developmental stages, and provide novel insight into the evolution of gene
expression regulation.

three ratios N/C, C/O, and N/O which are regarded as indicators of stellar
evolution, the ratio N/O is more reliable since it seems to be insensitive to
overionization of the NII and OII ions. On the other hand, the N/C and C/O
ratios, which include carbon, may contain systematic errors for stars with Teff
> 18500 K because of neglected overionization of CII ions. The ratio N/O is
studied in the atmospheres of 46 early main-sequence B stars. These values of
N/O are examined as functions of the effective temperature, age, rotation
speed, and mass of the stars. Most early B-stars in the main sequence are found
to have [N / O] = 0 , which indicates that N/O varies little during the main
sequence stage, and this result is independent of the basic parameters listed
above. There are two explanations for the large number of stars with [N / O] =
0 : it is predicted theoretically that for an initial rotation velocity V0 <
100 km/s, N/O varies little toward the end of the main sequence stage ([N/O] <
0.2) and observations show that most early main-sequence B-stars do actually
have low initial rotation velocities V0. The few early main-sequence B-stars
with higher [N/O] = 0.4-0.8 correspond to models with rotation velocities V0 =
200-300 km/s. This conclusion is consistent with earlier data for stars with
the same masses in a later stage of evolution: the AFG-supergiant and bright
giant stage.

models of the corona. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the
horizontal electric field from a sequence of radial-component magnetic field
maps. This problem of inverting Faraday's law has no unique solution.
Unfortunately, the simplest solution (a divergence-free electric field) is not
realistically localized in regions of non-zero magnetic field, as would be
expected from Ohm's law. Our new method generates instead a localized solution,
using a basis pursuit algorithm to find a sparse solution for the electric
field. The method is shown to perform well on test cases where the input
magnetic maps are flux balanced, in both Cartesian and spherical geometries.
However, we show that if the input maps have a significant imbalance of flux -
usually arising from data assimilation - then it is not possible to find a
localized, realistic, electric field solution. This is the main obstacle to
driving coronal models from time sequences of solar surface magnetic maps.

to the solar ones) of 100--200 for light trans-iron elements from Zn to Zr.
This is associated with appreciable ejection of neutron-rich matter in these

and damped excitations are illustrated for a three layer macrospin model system
that corresponds to a standard spin-torque oscillator. The free layer and a
synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyF) pinned layer of the spin-torque oscillator
are in-plane magnetized. In order to understand experimental results, numerical
simulations have been performed considering three types of interlayer
interactions: exchange interaction between the two magnetic layers of the SyF,
mutual spin torque between the top layer of the SyF and the free layer and
dipolar interaction between all three magnetic layers. It will be shown that
the dynamic dipolar coupling plays a predominant role. First, it leads to a
hybridization of the free layer and the SyF linear modes and through this gives
rise to a strong field dependence of the critical current. In particular, there
is a field range of enhanced damping in which much higher current is required
to drive the modes into steady state. This results in a gap in the excitation
spectrum. Second, the dynamic dipolar interaction is also responsible for the
non-linear interaction between the current driven steady state mode and the
damped modes of the system. Here one can distinguish: (i) a resonant
interaction that leads to a kink in the frequency-field and frequency-current
dispersions accompanied by a small hysteresis and a reduction of the linewidth
of the steady state mode and (ii) a non-resonant interaction that leads to a
strong frequency redshift of the damped mode. The results underline the strong
impact of interlayer coupling on the excitation spectra of spin-torque
oscillators and illustrate in a simple three mode model system how in the
non-linear regime the steady state and damped modes influence each other.

temperatures and high X-ray luminosities. The soft X-ray emission can be
explained by hydrogen nuclear burning on the surface of a white dwarf (WD)
accreting at an extremely high rate. A peculiar 67 s periodicity (P67) was
previously discovered in the XMM-Newton light curves of the SSS CAL 83. P67 was
detected in X-ray light curves spanning 9 years, but exhibits variability of
several seconds on time-scales as short as a few hours, and its properties are
remarkably similar to those of dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs). DNOs are short
time-scale modulations often observed in dwarf novae during outburst. DNOs are
explained by the well established low-inertia mag- netic accretor (LIMA) model.
In this paper, we show that P67 and its associated period variability can be
satisfactorily explained by an application of the LIMA model to the more
extreme environment in a SSS (eLIMA), contrary to another recent study at-
tempting to explain P67 and its associated variability in terms of non-radial
g-mode oscillations in the extended envelope of the rapidly accreting white
dwarf in CAL 83. In the eLIMA model, P67 originates in an equatorial belt in
the WD envelope at the boundary with the inner accretion disc, with the belt
weakly coupled to the WD core by a 100 000 G magnetic field. New optical light
curves obtained with the Sutherland High-speed Optical Camera (SHOC) are also
presented, exhibiting quasi-periodic modulations on time-scales of 1000 s,
compatible with the eLIMA framework.

observed above about $3\,{\times}\,10^{18}\,\text{eV}$, called ultra-high
energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We present a first, systematic approach that takes
the individual characteristics of these sources into account, as well as the
impact of the extragalactic magnetic-field structures up to a distance of 120
Mpc. We use a mixed simulation setup, based on 3D simulations of UHECRs ejected
by observed, individual radio galaxies taken out to a distance of 120 Mpc, and
on 1D simulations over a continuous source distribution contributing from
beyond 120 Mpc. Additionally, we include the ultra-luminous radio galaxy Cygnus
A at a distance of about $250\,$Mpc, as its contribution is so strong that it
must be considered as an individual point source. The implementation of the
UHECR ejection in our simulation setup is based on a detailed consideration of
the physics of radio jets and standard first-order Fermi acceleration. We show
that the average contribution of radio galaxies taken over a very large volume
cannot explain the observed features of UHECRs measured at Earth. However, we
obtain excellent agreement with the spectrum, composition, and
arrival-direction distribution of UHECRs measured by the Pierre Auger
Observatory, if we assume that most UHECRs observed arise from only two
sources: The ultra-luminous radio galaxy Cygnus A, providing a mostly light
composition of nuclear species dominating up to about
$6\,{\times}\,10^{19}\,$eV, and the nearest radio galaxy Centaurus A, providing
a heavy composition dominating above $6\,{\times}\,10^{19}\,$eV. Here we have
to assume that extragalactic magnetic fields out to 250 Mpc, which we did not
include in the simulation, are able to isotropize the UHECR events at about 8
EeV arriving from Cygnus A.

the direction of its propagation, interpolating between a circularly polarized

the spontaneously broken translation invariance. Quite remarkably, there is a
neutral-pion-like mode that remains gapped even in the chiral limit, in seeming
contradiction to the Goldstone theorem. Finally, we have a first look at the
effect of thermal fluctuations of the CSL, showing that even the soft
nonrelativistic excitation does not lead to the Landau-Peierls instability.
However, it leads to an anomalous contribution to pressure that scales with
temperature and magnetic field as $T^{5/2}(B/f_\pi)^{3/2}$.

environment. It has been reported in the literature that the mechanism
responsible for the solar activity modulation behaves like a low-dimensional
chaotic system. Studying these kind of physical systems and, in particular,
their temporal evolution requires non-linear analysis methods. To this regard,
in this work we apply the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to the study
of two of the most commonly used solar cycle indicators; i.e. the series of the
sunspots number (SSN), and the radio flux 10.7 cm, with the aim of identifying
possible dynamical transitions in the system. A task which is particularly
suited to the RQA. The outcome of this analysis reveals the presence of large
fluctuations of two RQA measures; namely the determinism and the laminarity. In
addition, large differences are also seen between the evolution of the RQA
measures of the SSN and the radio flux. That suggests the presence of
transitions in the dynamics underlying the solar activity. Besides it also
shows and quantifies the different nature of these two solar indices.
Furthermore, in order to check whether our results are affected by data
artifacts, we have also applied the RQA to both the recently recalibrated SSN
series and the previous one, unveiling the main differences between the two
data sets. The results are discussed in light of the recent literature on the

that certain label class interactions are indeed better modelled by a

found a fine-scale photospheric pattern (1 arc) diverging with a speed of about

manifestation of magnetic flux emergence. As a response to the plasma
ejections, the corona displayed small-scale transient brightenings. Based on
our findings, we suggest that the shock waves can be excited by the local
disturbance caused by magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux inside
the light bridge and the adjacent umbral magnetic field. The disturbance
generates slow-mode waves, which soon develop into shock waves, and manifest
themselves as the arcsecond-scale plasma ejections. It also appears that the
dissipation of mechanical energy in the shock waves can heat the local corona.

  of Electric Vehicles",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The penetration of electric vehicles becomes a catalyst for the
sustainability of Smart Cities. However, unregulated battery charging remains a
challenge causing high energy costs, power peaks or even blackouts. This paper
studies this challenge from a socio-technical perspective: social dynamics such
as the participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by
alternative suggested vehicle usage times and even the fairness in terms of how
equally discomfort is experienced among the population are highly intertwined
with Smart Grid reliability. To address challenges of such a socio-technical
nature, this paper introduces a fully decentralized and participatory learning
mechanism for privacy-preserving coordinated charging control of electric
vehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects: (i)
reliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. In contrast to related work, a
novel autonomous software agent exclusively uses local knowledge to generate
energy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different battery charging
regimes. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which plan
to execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced system-wide.
Evaluation with real-world data confirms the improvement of drivers' comfort
and fairness using the proposed planning method, while this improvement is
assessed in terms of reliability and cost reduction under a varying number of
participating vehicles. These findings have a significant relevance and impact
for power utilities and system operator on designing more reliable and socially
responsible Smart Grids with high penetration of electric vehicles.

smart-phones. Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling,

end-to-end encrypted service. This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls,
videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by
any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp. In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp
messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on
its privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, which
forms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protection
against forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue that
simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadata
can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their
patterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the security
architecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocols
used. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what further
measures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability.
We start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to be
understood to properly understand security, (ii) the security architecture,
(iii) security evaluation, (iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of the
important concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating the
architecture are - end-to-end encryption (E2EE), signal protocol, and
curve25519. The description of the security architecture covers key management,
end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp, Authentication Mechanism, Message Exchange,
and finally the security evaluation. We then cover importance of metadata and
role it plays in conserving privacy with respect to whatsapp.

problem: the expansion of water upon freezing is incompatible with the

this conundrum is resolved through an intermittent fracturing of the brittle
ice shell and cavitation in the enclosed liquid, culminating in an explosion of
the partially frozen droplet. We propose a basic model to elucidate the
interplay between a steady build-up of stresses and their fast release. The
model reveals that for millimetric droplets the fragment velocities upon
explosion are independent of the droplet size and only depend on material
properties (such as the tensile stress of the ice and the bulk modulus of
water). For small (sub-millimetric) droplets, on the other hand, surface
tension starts to play a role. In this regime we predict that water droplets
with radii below 50 micrometer are unlikely to explode at all. We expect our
findings to be relevant in the modeling of freezing cloud and rain droplets.

in experiments and by theory. For a sufficiently large mass anisotropy, the
particles typically move along helical trajectories whose axis is oriented
either parallel or antiparallel to the direction of gravity (i.e., they show

rotates the direction of translational self-propulsion of the particles, their
trajectories have many loops, whereas elongated swimming paths occur if the
angular self-propulsion is weak. We show that the observed gravitational
alignment mechanism and the dependence of the trajectory shape on the angular

Multiple Access (NCMA). A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of
physical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost NOMA
throughputs. We first show that a simple NCMA architecture in which all users
use the same modulation, referred to as rate-homogeneous NCMA, can achieve
substantial throughput improvement over SIC-based NOMA under near
power-balanced scenarios. Then, we put forth a new NCMA architecture, referred
to as rate-diverse NCMA, in which different users may adopt different
modulations commensurate with their relative SNRs. A challenge for rate-diverse
NCMA is the design of a channel-coded PNC system. This paper is the first
attempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC. Experimental results on our

like five kinds of segregation patterns for different driving control
parameters, i.e., Brazil nut (BN), reversed Brazil nut (RBN), Mixed states,
light-BN (LBN), and light-RBN (LRBN), where the latter two regimes are neither
purely segregated nor completely mixed states. Not only that, but LBN (LRBN) is
observed to be the transition path from BN (RBN) to Mixed state. Moreover, BN
phenomenon takes place in the area of low density ratio and found to be

  Component Analysis",,,,,"cs.IT cs.AI math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider an online version of the robust Principle Component Analysis
(PCA), which arises naturally in time-varying source separations such as video
foreground-background separation. This paper proposes a compressive online
robust PCA with prior information for recursively separating a sequences of
frames into sparse and low-rank components from a small set of measurements. In
contrast to conventional batch-based PCA, which processes all the frames
directly, the proposed method processes measurements taken from each frame.
Moreover, this method can efficiently incorporate multiple prior information,
namely previous reconstructed frames, to improve the separation and thereafter,
update the prior information for the next frame. We utilize multiple prior
information by solving $n\text{-}\ell_{1}$ minimization for incorporating the
previous sparse components and using incremental singular value decomposition
($\mathrm{SVD}$) for exploiting the previous low-rank components. We also
establish theoretical bounds on the number of measurements required to
guarantee successful separation under assumptions of static or slowly-changing
low-rank components. Using numerical experiments, we evaluate our bounds and
the performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we apply the proposed
algorithm to online video foreground and background separation from compressive
measurements. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
the existing methods.

attractor of a random dynamical system generated by an S(P)DE has received
considerable attention, for example by the work of Gess and R\""ockner. Recently
some authors investigated sufficient conditions which guarantee
synchronization, i.e. existence of a random attractor which is a singleton. It
is reasonable to conjecture that synchronization and negativity (or
non-positivity) of the top Lyapunov exponent of the system should be closely
related since both mean that the system is contracting in some sense. Based on
classical results by Ruelle, we formulate positive results in this direction.
Finally we provide two very simple but striking examples of one-dimensional
monotone random dynamical systems for which 0 is a fixed point. In the first
example, the Lyapunov exponent is strictly negative but nevertheless all
trajectories starting outside of 0 diverge to $\infty$ or $-\infty$. In
particular, there is no synchronization (not even locally). In the second
example (which is just the time reversal of the first), the Lyapunov exponent
is strictly positive but nevertheless there is synchronization.

nanoscopic wire in order to obtain extremely high storage density. In racetrack
memory, each magnetic domain can store a single bit of information, which can
be sensed by a reading port (head). The memory has a tape-like structure which
supports a shift operation that moves the domains to be read sequentially by
the head. In order to increase the memory's speed, prior work studied how to
minimize the latency of the shift operation, while the no less important
reliability of this operation has received only a little attention.
  In this work we design codes which combat shift errors in racetrack memory,
called position errors. Namely, shifting the domains is not an error-free
operation and the domains may be over-shifted or are not shifted, which can be
modeled as deletions and sticky insertions. While it is possible to use
conventional deletion and insertion-correcting codes, we tackle this problem
with the special structure of racetrack memory, where the domains can be read
by multiple heads. Each head outputs a noisy version of the stored data and the
multiple outputs are combined in order to reconstruct the data. Under this
paradigm, we will show that it is possible to correct, with at most a single
bit of redundancy, $d$ deletions with $d+1$ heads if the heads are
well-separated. Similar results are provided for burst of deletions, sticky
insertions and combinations of both deletions and sticky insertions.

applications for spin filtering and Cooper pair splitter devices and is an
essential ingredient for realizing topologically protected quantum computing
using Majorana zero modes. Here we report electrical conductance measurements
of a quantum point contact (QPC) formed in an indium antimonide nanowire as a

linearly in width with magnetic field before enveloping the $1e^2/h$ plateau.
Rotating the external magnetic field either parallel or perpendicular to the
spin-orbit field allows us to clearly attribute this experimental signature to
SOI. We compare our observations with a model of a QPC incorporating SOI and
extract a spin-orbit energy of ~6.5meV, which is significantly stronger than

  Bounds under Uncoded Cache Placement","22 pages, 3 figures; accepted by IEEE TIT",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak
hours by storing some content at the users' local caches. For the shared-link
network with end-user-caches, Maddah-Ali and Niesen proposed a two-phase coded
caching strategy. In practice, users may communicate with the server through
intermediate relays. This paper studies the tradeoff between the memory size
$M$ and the network load $R$ for networks where a server with $N$ files is
connected to $H$ relays (without caches), which in turn are connected to $K$
users equipped with caches of $M$ files. When each user is connected to a
different subset of $r$ relays, i.e., $K = \binom{H}{r}$, the system is
referred to as a {\it combination network with end-user-caches}.
  In this work, converse bounds are derived for the practically motivated case
of {\it uncoded} cache contents, that is, bits of the various files are
directly pushed into the user caches without any coding. In this case, once the
cache contents and the user demands are known, the problem reduces to a general
index coding problem.This paper shows that relying on a well-known ""acyclic
index coding converse bound"" results in converse bounds that are not tight for
combination networks with end-user-caches. A novel converse bound that
leverages the network topology is proposed, which is the tightest converse
bound known to date. As a result of independent interest, an inequality that
generalizes the well-known sub-modularity of entropy is derived. Several novel
caching schemes are proposed, based on the Maddah-Ali and Niesen cache
placement. The proposed schemes are proved: (i) to be (order) optimal for some
$(N,M,H,r)$ parameters regimes under the constraint of uncoded cache placement,
and (ii) to outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in numerical evaluations.

where an explicitly time-dependent electronic wave packet is represented as a
linear combination of $N$-electron wave functions. The central quantity of
interest is the electronic flux density, which contains all information about
the transient electronic density, the associated phase, and their temporal
evolution. It is computed from the associated one-electron operator by reducing
the multi-determinantal, many-electron wave packet using the Slater-Condon
rules. Here, we introduce a general tool for post-processing multi-determinant
configuration-interaction wave functions obtained at various levels of theory.
It is tailored to extract directly the data from the output of standard quantum
chemistry packages using atom-centered Gaussian-type basis functions. The
procedure is implemented in the open-source Python program detCI@ORBKIT, which
shares and builds upon the modular design of our recently published
post-processing toolbox [J. Comput. Chem. 37 (2016) 1511]. The new procedure is
applied to ultrafast charge migration processes in different molecular systems,
demonstrating its broad applicability. Convergence of the $N$-electron dynamics
with respect to the electronic structure theory level and basis set size is
investigated. This provides an assessment of the robustness of qualitative and
quantitative statements that can be made concerning dynamical features observed

limit of weak interactions. The solution shows that, in general, the
conductances scale with the bias voltages in an essentially different way
compared to their scaling with the temperature $T$. Specifically, unlike in the
two-terminal setup, the nonlinear conductances cannot be generically obtained
from the linear ones by simply replacing $T$ with the ""corresponding"" bias

prevents the interaction-induced breakup of the main wire into two disconnected

reach a target point in a confining domain, is a key quantity in the theory of
stochastic processes. Its importance comes from its crucial role to quantify
the efficiency of processes as varied as diffusion-limited reactions, target
search processes or spreading of diseases. Most methods to determine the FPT
properties in confined domains have been limited to Markovian (memoryless)
processes. However, as soon as the random walker interacts with its
environment, memory effects can not be neglected. Examples of non Markovian
dynamics include single-file diffusion in narrow channels or the motion of a
tracer particle either attached to a polymeric chain or diffusing in simple or
complex fluids such as nematics \cite{turiv2013effect}, dense soft colloids or
viscoelastic solution. Here, we introduce an analytical approach to calculate,
in the limit of a large confining volume, the mean FPT of a Gaussian
non-Markovian random walker to a target point. The non-Markovian features of
the dynamics are encompassed by determining the statistical properties of the
trajectory of the random walker in the future of the first-passage event, which
are shown to govern the FPT kinetics.This analysis is applicable to a broad
range of stochastic processes, possibly correlated at long-times. Our
theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for several
examples of non-Markovian processes including the emblematic case of the
Fractional Brownian Motion in one or higher dimensions. These results show, on
the basis of Gaussian processes, the importance of memory effects in
first-passage statistics of non-Markovian random walkers in confinement.

recently discovered that offers a platform for realizing many exotic physical
phenomena. A TDS is characterized by the linear touching of bulk (conduction
and valance) bands at discrete points in the momentum space (i.e. 3D Dirac
points), such as in Na3Bi and Cd3As2. More recently, new types of Dirac
semimetals with robust Dirac line-nodes (with non-trivial topology or near the
critical point between topological phase transitions) have been proposed that
extends the bulk linear touching from discrete points to 1D lines. In this
work, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we explored the
electronic structure of the non-symmorphic crystals MSiS (M=Hf, Zr).
Remarkably, by mapping out the band structure in the full 3D Brillouin Zone

their dispersions. Interestingly, along directions other than the line-nodes in
the 3D BZ, the bulk degeneracy is lifted by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in both
compounds with larger magnitude in HfSiS. Our work not only experimentally
confirms a new Dirac line-node semimetal family protected by non-symmorphic
symmetry, but also helps understanding and further exploring the exotic
properties as well as practical applications of the MSiS family of compounds.

Frequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope. Hosted by a z=0.026 elliptical galaxy, it
has a relatively large angular size of 12' (corresponding to 360 kpc projected
linear size) and a morphology reminiscent of a remnant Fanaroff-Riley type II
(FRII) radio galaxy. We combine LOFAR and archival images to study the spectral
properties at a spatial resolution of 1'. We derive low frequency spectral
index maps and use synchrotron ageing models to infer ages for different
regions of the source. Using radiative ageing model fitting we show that the
AGN activity ceased around 50 Myr ago. We note that the outer regions of the
lobes are younger than the inner regions which is interpreted as a sign that
those regions are remnant hotspots. We demonstrate the usefulness of maps of
AGN radio remnants taken at low frequencies and suggest caution over the
interpretation of spectral ages derived from integrated flux density
measurements versus age mapping. The spectral index properties as well as the
derived ages of B2 0924+30 are consistent with it being an FRII AGN radio
remnant. LOFAR data are proving to be instrumental in extending our studies to
the lowest radio frequencies and enabling analysis of the oldest source
regions.

  Meteorological society",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dimensionally split advection schemes are attractive for atmospheric
modelling due to their efficiency and accuracy in each spatial dimension.
Accurate long time-steps can be achieved without significant cost using the
flux-form semi-Lagrangian technique. The dimensionally split scheme used here
is constructed from the one-dimensional Piecewise Parabolic Method and extended
to two dimensions using COSMIC splitting. The dimensionally split scheme is
compared with a genuinely multi-dimensional, method of lines scheme with
implicit time-stepping which is stable for large Courant numbers.
  Two-dimensional advection test cases on Cartesian planes are proposed that
avoid the complexities of a spherical domain or multi-panel meshes. These are
solid body rotation, horizontal advection over orography and deformational
flow. The test cases use distorted meshes either to represent sloping terrain
or to mimic the distortions of a cubed sphere.
  Such mesh distortions are expected to accentuate the errors associated with
dimension splitting, however, the dimensionally split scheme is very accurate
on orthogonal meshes and accuracy decreases only a little in the presence of
large mesh distortions. The dimensionally split scheme also loses some accuracy
when long time-steps are used. The multi-dimensional scheme is almost entirely
insensitive to mesh distortions and asymptotes to second-order accuracy at high
resolution. As is expected for implicit time-stepping, phase errors occur when
using long time-steps but the spatially well resolved features are advected at
the correct speed and the multi-dimensional scheme is always stable.
  An estimate of computational cost reveals that the implicit scheme is the
most expensive, particularly for large Courant numbers. If the
multi-dimensional scheme is used instead with explicit time-stepping, the cost
becomes similar to the dimensionally split scheme.

join the attraction. We formulate the joining probability as a function of
social influence from others, reflecting that individual choice behavior is
likely influenced by others. By controlling pedestrian influx and the social
influence parameter, we identify various pedestrian flow patterns. For the
bidirectional flow scenario, we observe a transition from the free flow phase
to the freezing phase, in which oppositely walking pedestrians reach a complete
stop and block each other. On the other hand, a different transition behavior
appears in the unidirectional flow scenario, i.e., from the free flow phase to
the localized jam phase and then to the extended jam phase. It is also observed
that the extended jam phase can end up in freezing phenomena with a certain
probability when pedestrian flux is high with strong social influence. This
study highlights that attractive interactions between pedestrians and an
attraction can trigger jamming transitions by increasing the number of
conflicts among pedestrians near the attraction. In order to avoid excessive
pedestrian jams, we suggest suppressing the number of conflicts under a certain
level by moderating pedestrian influx especially when the social influence is

the different kind of surfaces at a Rayleigh number $Ra \approx 2 \cdot 10^6$,
the one with staggered wedges has the highest heat transfer. A large number of

different ranges of the Nusselt number ($Nu$) relationship as a function of
$Ra$. Flow visualizations allow to explain the differences in the $Nu(Ra)$
relationship. Two values of the thermal conductivity were chosen, one

the Nusselt number behaves as $Nu=\alpha Ra^\gamma$, with $\alpha$ and $\gamma$

overall fidelity of quantum protocols when performed on physical qubits with
finite coherence time. Reducing the time required to distinguish qubit states
with high fidelity is therefore a critical goal in quantum information science.
The state-of-the-art readout of superconducting qubits is based on the
dispersive interaction with a readout resonator. Here, we bring this technique
to its current limit and demonstrate how the careful design of system
parameters leads to fast and high-fidelity measurements without affecting qubit
coherence. We achieve this result by increasing the dispersive interaction
strength, by choosing an optimal linewidth of the readout resonator, by
employing a Purcell filter, and by utilizing phase-sensitive parametric
amplification. In our experiment, we measure 98.25% readout fidelity in only 48
ns, when minimizing read-out time, and 99.2% in 88 ns, when maximizing the
fidelity, limited predominantly by the qubit lifetime of 7.6 us. The presented
scheme is also expected to be suitable for integration into a multiplexed
readout architecture.

The data acquisition time, however, is relatively long and non-uniform sampling
can be applied to reduce this time. To obtain the full spectrum,a
reconstruction method with Vandermonde factorization is proposed.This method
explores the general signal property in magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Its
time domain signal is approximated by a sum of a few exponentials. Results on

For understanding the evolution and dynamics of solar magnetic and velocity
fields, an imaging spectropolarimeter is being developed as one of the back-end
instruments of MAST. This system consists of a narrow-band filter and a
polarimeter. Polarimeter includes a linear polarizer and two sets of Liquid
Crystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs). The instrument is intended for the
simultaneous observations in the spectral lines 617.3 nm and 854.2 nm, which
are formed in photosphere and chromosphere, respectively. In this paper, we
present results from the characterization of the LCVRs for the spectral lines
of interest and response matrix of the polarimeter. We also present preliminary
observations of an active region obtained using the spectropolarimeter. For
verification, we compare the Stokes observations of the active region obtained
from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory

good agreement between both the observations, considering the fact that MAST

highly detailed and sharp. However, receptor density in the retina is not
uniform: a small central region called the fovea is very dense and exhibits
high resolution, whereas a peripheral region around it has much lower spatial
resolution. Thus, contrary to our perception, we are only able to observe a
very small region around the line of sight with high resolution. The perception
of a complete and stable view is aided by an attention mechanism that directs
the eyes to the numerous points of interest within the scene. The eyes move
between these targets in quick, unconscious movements, known as ""saccades"".
Once a target is centered at the fovea, the eyes fixate for a fraction of a
second while the visual system extracts the necessary information. An
artificial visual system was built based on a fully recurrent neural network
set within a reinforcement learning protocol, and learned to attend to regions
of interest while solving a classification task. The model is consistent with

ratio. Starting from the notion of limited social bandwidth, and assuming fixed
costs for the links in each layer, we propose a null model built on a
grand-canonical ensemble that generates the observed hierarchical social
structure. The observed internal structure of ego-networks becomes a natural
outcome to expect when we assume the existence of layers demanding different
amounts of resources. In the thermodynamic limit, reached when the number of
ego-network copies is large, the specific layer degrees follow a Poisson
distribution. We also find that, under certain conditions, equispaced layer
costs are necessary to obtain a constant group size scaling. Our model presents
interesting analogies to a Bose-Einstein gas, that we briefly discuss. Finally,
