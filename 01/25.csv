numerically that the probability of invasion of a pore at a distance $r$ away

$N(r,t)\propto r^{-1}f\left(r^{D}/t\right)$, where $D$ is the fractal dimension

functional dependency of $N(r,t)$ and the scaling exponent for the short-time

naive scheme is to read $\alpha n$ coordinates of the codeword. This method
used in conjunction with MDS codes guarantees recovery from any $\lfloor(\alpha

constrained variational problem with a partial symmetry breaking Lagrangian and
obtain the Euler--Poincar\'e equations from a variational principle. By
applying a Legendre transformation to it, we recover the Lie-Poisson equations
obtained by A. D. Borum [Master's Thesis, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, 2015] in the same context. We also discretize the variational
principle in time and obtain the discrete-time Lie-Poisson equations. We
illustrate the theory with some practical examples including a motion planning

provides vital methods for understanding complex systems. Multilayer networks,
in their multiplex form, have been introduced within the last three years to
analysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have
modelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial
institutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a
non-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising
the same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No
mechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically
evaluated, and no multichannel stabilisation strategies for pre-emptive
contagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an
interconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial
institutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity
within different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial
market. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and
resilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion
mechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost
stabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their
interconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion
progressing through the overall structure. The stabilisation strategies subtly
affect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural
resilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each
institution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate
the new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential
Regulatory Authority of the Bank of England. The capabilities of multichannel
stabilisation are confirmed empirically.

survival data is presented for the three most commonly-used semiparametric
models: proportional hazards, proportional odds, and accelerated failure time.
Unlike many other approaches, all manner of censored survival times are
simultaneously accommodated including uncensored, interval censored,
current-status, left and right censored, and mixtures of these. Left-truncated
data are also accommodated leading to models for time-dependent covariates.
Both georeferenced (location exactly observed) and areally observed (location
known up to a geographic unit such as a county) spatial locations are handled;
formal variable selection makes model selection especially easy. Model fit is
assessed with conditional Cox-Snell residual plots, and model choice is carried
out via LPML and DIC. Baseline survival is modeled with a novel transformed
Bernstein polynomial prior. All models are fit via a new function which calls
efficient compiled C++ in the R package spBayesSurv. The methodology is broadly
illustrated with simulations and real data applications. An important finding
is that proportional odds and accelerated failure time models often fit
significantly better than the commonly-used proportional hazards model.

$\mathcal{O}^*((q-\varepsilon)^k)$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, unless the
Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails. In this paper we perform a
fine-grained analysis of the complexity of $q$-Coloring with respect to a

there is no universal constant $\theta$ such that $q$-Coloring parameterized by

first time, the new APS data with a model describing the emission of unresolved
blazars. These sources are expected to dominate the anisotropy signal. The
model we employ in our analysis reproduces well the blazars resolved by Fermi
LAT. When considering the APS obtained by masking the sources in the 3FGL
catalogue, we find that unresolved blazars under-produce the measured APS below
$\sim$1 GeV. Contrary to past results, this suggests the presence of a new
contribution to the low-energy APS, with a significance of, at least,
5$\sigma$. The excess can be ascribed to a new class of faint gamma-ray
emitters. If we consider the APS obtained by masking the sources in the 2FGL
catalogue, there is no under-production of the APS below 1 GeV, but the new
source class is still preferred over the blazars-only scenario (with a
significance larger than 10$\sigma$). The properties of the new source class
and the level of anisotropies induced in the isotropic gamma-ray background are
the same, independent of the APS data used. In particular, the new gamma-ray
emitters must have a soft energy spectrum, with a spectral index ranging,
approximately, from 2.7 to 3.2. This complicates their interpretation in terms
of known sources, since, normally, star-forming and radio galaxies are observed
with a harder spectrum. The new source class identified here is also expected
to contribute significantly to the intensity of the isotropic gamma-ray

\textit{defective items}. The idea of NAGT is to pool a group of items, which

\textit{positive}, there exists at least one defective item in the test, and if
it is \textit{negative}, there exists no defective items. Formally, a binary $t

$\mathcal{M}$ can be decoded with high probability in time $O\left(
\frac{\ln^2{N}}{\ln^2{\ln{N}}} \right)$. When the number of defective items is
greater than 2, we present a scheme that can identify at least $(1-\epsilon)d$

three-dimensional MHD simulations. We studied eight magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulation runs with different mass density structure of the prominence, and
one hydrodynamic simulation run, and compared the result. In order to compare

studied prominence activation by injection of triangular shaped coronal shock.
We found that magnetic tension force mainly accelerate (and then decelerate)

shock front sweeps through the the prominence and damps almost exponentially.
We construct phenomenological model of bulk momentum transfer from shock to the

several percent of total energy released during the X5.4 flare.

transmitter and receiver communicate over a discrete memoryless channel. The
wiretapper has perfect access to a fixed-length subset of the transmitted
codeword symbols of her choosing. Additionally, she observes the remainder of
the transmitted symbols through a discrete memoryless channel. This new model
subsumes the classical wiretap channel and wiretap channel II with noisy main
channel as its special cases. The strong secrecy capacity of the proposed
channel model is identified. Achievability is established by solving a dual
secret key agreement problem in the source model, and converting the solution
to the original channel model using probability distribution approximation
arguments. In the dual problem, a source encoder and decoder, who observe
random sequences independent and identically distributed according to the input
and output distributions of the legitimate channel in the original problem,
communicate a confidential key over a public error-free channel using a single
forward transmission, in the presence of a compound wiretapping source who has
perfect access to the public discussion. The security of the key is guaranteed
for the exponentially many possibilities of the subset chosen at wiretapper by
deriving a lemma which provides a doubly-exponential convergence rate for the
probability that, for a fixed choice of the subset, the key is uniform and
independent from the public discussion and the wiretapping source's
observation. The converse is derived by using Sanov's theorem to upper bound
the secrecy capacity of the new wiretap channel model by the secrecy capacity
when the tapped subset is randomly chosen by nature.

approach to clustering high-dimensional data. Typically, the numbers of
clusters and latent factors must be specified in advance of model fitting, and
remain fixed. The pair which optimises some model selection criterion is then
chosen. For computational reasons, models in which the number of latent factors
differ across clusters are rarely considered. Here the infinite mixture of
infinite factor analysers (IMIFA) model is introduced. IMIFA employs a
Pitman-Yor process prior to facilitate automatic inference of the number of
clusters using the stick-breaking construction and a slice sampler.
Furthermore, IMIFA employs multiplicative gamma process shrinkage priors to
allow cluster-specific numbers of factors, automatically inferred via an
adaptive Gibbs sampler. IMIFA is presented as the flagship of a family of
factor-analytic mixture models, providing flexible approaches to clustering
high-dimensional data. Applications to a benchmark data set, metabolomic
spectral data, and a manifold learning handwritten digit example illustrate the
IMIFA model and its advantageous features. These include obviating the need for
model selection criteria, reducing the computational burden associated with the
search of the model space, improving clustering performance by allowing
cluster-specific numbers of factors, and quantifying uncertainty in the numbers
of clusters and cluster-specific factors.

favored over co-expression networks. However, hardly any Bayesian network study
concerns the false discovery control (FDC) of network edges, leading to low
accuracies due to systematic biases from inconsistent false discovery levels in
the same study. We design four empirical tests to examine the FDC of Bayesian
networks from three p-value based lasso regression variable selections --- two
existing and one we originate. Our method, lassopv, computes p-values for the
critical regularization strength at which a predictor starts to contribute to
lasso regression. Using null and Geuvadis datasets, we find that lassopv
obtains optimal FDC in Bayesian gene networks, whilst existing methods have
defective p-values. The FDC concept and tests extend to most network inference
scenarios and will guide the design and improvement of new and existing
methods. Our novel variable selection method with lasso regression also allows
FDC on other datasets and questions, even beyond network inference and
computational biology. Lassopv is implemented in R and freely available at

sources of cosmological information, it is important to have a precise
understanding of the cosmological observables; for this reason, the Effective
Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) was developed. So far, most
results in the EFTofLSS have used the so-called Einstein-de Sitter
approximation, an approximation of the time dependence which is known to be
accurate to better than one percent. However, in order to reach even higher
accuracy, the full time dependence must be used. The computation with exact
time dependence is sensitive to both infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) effects
in the loop integrands, and while these effects must cancel because of
diffeomorphism invariance, they make numerical computation much less efficient.
We provide a formulation of the one-loop, equal-time exact-time-dependence
power spectrum of density perturbations which is manifestly free of these
spurious IR and UV divergences at the level of the integrand. We extend our
results to the total matter mode with clustering quintessence, show that IR and
UV divergences cancel, and provide the associated IR- and UV-safe integrand.
This also establishes that the consistency conditions are satisfied in this
system. We then use our one-loop result to do an improved precision comparison
of the two-loop dark-matter power spectrum with the Dark Sky N-body simulation.

follow-up at three frequencies which provides direct and unequivocal evidence
of the AGN activity in IC883. Our analysis of archival X-ray data, together
with the detection of a transient radio source with luminosity typical of
bright supernovae, give further evidence of the ongoing star formation
activity, which dominates the energetics of the system. At sub-parsec scales,
the radio nucleus has a core-jet morphology with the jet being a newly ejected
component showing a subluminal proper motion of 0.6c-1c. The AGN contributes
less than two per cent of the total IR luminosity of the system. The
corresponding Eddington factor is ~1E-3, suggesting this is a low-accretion
rate engine, as often found in LLAGNs. However, its high bolometric luminosity
(~10E44erg/s) agrees better with a normal AGN. This apparent discrepancy may
just be an indication of the transition nature of the nucleus from a system
dominated by star-formation, to an AGN-dominated system. The nucleus has a
strongly inverted spectrum and a turnover at ~4.4GHz, thus qualifying as a
candidate for the least luminous (L_5.0GHz ~ 6.3E28erg/s/Hz) and one of the
youngest (~3000yr) gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) sources. If the GPS origin
for the IC883 nucleus is confirmed, then advanced mergers in the LIRG category

next decade. While a simple statistical detection is expected with SKA
pathfinders, the SKA will hopefully produce a full 3D mapping of the signal. To
extract from the observed data constraints on the parameters describing the
underlying astrophysical processes, inversion methods must be developed. For
example, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method has been successfully applied.
Here we test another possible inversion method: artificial neural networks
(ANN). We produce a training set which consists of 70 individual sample. Each
sample is made of the 21 cm power spectrum at different redshifts produced with
the 21cmFast code plus the value of three parameters used in the semi-numerical
simulations that describe astrophysical processes. Using this set we train the
network to minimize the error between the parameter values it produces as an
output and the true values. We explore the impact of the architecture of the
network on the quality of the training. Then we test the trained network on the
new set of 54 test samples with different values of the parameters. We find
that the quality of the parameter reconstruction depends on the sensitivity of
the power spectrum to the different parameters at a given redshift, that
including thermal noise and sample variance decreases the quality of the
reconstruction and that using the power spectrum at several redshifts as an
input to the ANN improves the quality of the reconstruction. We conclude that
ANNs are a viable inversion method whose main strength is that they require a
sparse exploration of the parameter space and thus should be usable with full

viable option for obtaining solutions. One such approximation, which recently
became popular, is the M1 method. It utilizes the system of the lowest two
moments of the transport equation and closes the system with an ad hoc closure
relation. The accuracy of the M1 solution depends on the quality of the
closure. Several closures have been proposed in the literature and have been
used in various studies. We carry out an extensive study of these closures by
comparing the results of M1 calculations with precise Monte Carlo calculations
of the radiation field around spherically-symmetric protoneutron star models.
We find that no closure performs consistently better or worse than others in
all cases. The level of accuracy a given closure yields depends on the matter
configuration, neutrino type, and neutrino energy. Given this limitation, the
maximum entropy closure by Minerbo (1978) on average yields relatively accurate
results in the broadest set of cases considered in this work.

ignored them altogether. Here, we analyse the magnetic fields predicted by the
simulations of the Auriga Project, a set of 30 high-resolution cosmological
zoom simulations of Milky~Way-like galaxies, carried out with a moving-mesh
magneto-hydrodynamics code and a detailed galaxy formation physics model. We
find that the magnetic fields grow exponentially at early times owing to a
small-scale dynamo with an e-folding time of roughly $100\,\rm{Myr}$ in the
center of halos until saturation occurs around $z=2-3$, when the magnetic
energy density reaches about $10\%$ of the turbulent energy density with a
typical strength of $10-50\,\rm{\mu G}$. In the galactic centers the ratio
between magnetic and turbulent energy remains nearly constant until $z=0$. At
larger radii, differential rotation in the disks leads to linear amplification
that typically saturates around $z=0.5$ to $z=0$. The final radial and vertical
variations of the magnetic field strength can be well described by two joint
exponential profiles, and are in good agreement with observational constraints.
Overall, the magnetic fields have only little effect on the global evolution of
the galaxies as it takes too long to reach equipartition. We also demonstrate
that our results are well converged with numerical resolution.

minor. Using 2D simulations of a simplified setup in cylindrical geometry, we
examine the impact of rotation on the Standing Accretion Shock Instability
(SASI) and the corotation instability, also known as low-T/|W|. The influence
of rotation on the saturation amplitude of these instabilities depends on the
specific angular momentum in the accretion flow and the ratio of the shock to
the neutron star radii. The spiral mode of SASI becomes more vigorous with
faster rotation only if this ratio is large enough. A corotation instability
develops at large rotation rates and impacts the dynamics more dramatically,
leading to a strong one-armed spiral wave. Non-axisymmetric instabilities are
able to redistribute angular momentum radially and affect the pulsar spin at
birth. A systematic study of the relationship between the core rotation period
of the progenitor and the initial pulsar spin is performed. Stellar rotation
rates for which pulsars are spun up or down by SASI are estimated. Rapidly
spinning progenitors are modestly spun down by spiral modes, less than $\sim
30\%$, when a corotation instability develops. Given the observational
constraints on pulsar spin periods at birth, this suggests that rapid rotation
might not play a significant hydrodynamic role in most core-collapse
supernovae.

is tightly constrained by the absence of overheating and overcooling as probed
by X-ray data and hydrodynamic simulations ($\varepsilon_{\rm BH} \simeq$
10$^{-3}\, T_{\rm x,7.4}$). The micro flow is shaped by general relativistic
effects tracked by state-of-the-art GR-RMHD simulations ($\varepsilon_\bullet

$T_{\rm x}$, or related cosmic scaling relation (as $L_{\rm x}$). The model is
minimally based on first principles, as conservation of energy and mass
recycling. The inflow occurs via chaotic cold accretion (CCA), the rain of cold
clouds condensing out of the quenched cooling flow and recurrently funneled via
inelastic collisions. Within 100s gravitational radii, the accretion energy is
transformed into ultrafast 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$ outflows (UFOs) ejecting most of
the inflowing mass. At larger radii the energy-driven outflow entrains
progressively more mass: at roughly kpc scale, the velocities of the
hot/warm/cold outflows are a few 10$^3$, 1000, 500 km s$^{-1}$, with median
mass rates ~10, 100, several 100 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The unified
CCA model is consistent with the observations of nuclear UFOs, and ionized,
neutral, and molecular macro outflows. We provide step-by-step implementation

prevented from forming stars. H$_2$ therefore needs to be irradiated by a large
flux of Lyman-Werner (LW) UV photons in order to suppress H$_2$ cooling. A key
uncertainty in this scenario is the escape fraction of LW radiation from first
galaxies, the dominant source of UV photons at this epoch. To better constrain
this escape fraction, we have performed radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of
the growth of HII regions and their associated photodissociation regions in the
first galaxies using the ZEUS-MP code. We find that the LW escape fraction
crucially depends on the propagation of the ionisation front (I-front). For an
R-type I-front overrunning the halo, the LW escape fraction is always larger
than 95%. If the halo recombines later from the outside--in, due to a softened
and weakened spectrum, the LW escape fraction in the rest-frame of the halo

analyse slowly moving, D-type I-fronts, where the escape fraction depends on

binary systems and may interact with their companion through mass transfer or
merging. We undertake a population synthesis study to compute the delay-time
distribution of core-collapse supernovae, that is, the supernova rate versus
time following a starburst, taking into account binary interactions. We test
the systematic robustness of our results by running various simulations to
account for the uncertainties in our standard assumptions. We find that a
significant fraction, $15^{+9}_{-8}$%, of core-collapse supernovae are `late',
that is, they occur 50-200 Myrs after birth, when all massive single stars have
already exploded. These late events originate predominantly from binary systems
with at least one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of
intermediate mass ($4-8M_{\odot}$). The main evolutionary channels that
contribute often involve either the merging of the initially more massive
primary star with its companion or the engulfment of the remaining core of the
primary by the expanding secondary that has accreted mass at an earlier
evolutionary stage. Also, the total number of core-collapse supernovae
increases by $14^{+15}_{-14}$% because of binarity for the same initial stellar
mass. The high rate implies that we should have already observed such late
core-collapse supernovae, but have not recognized them as such. We argue that
$\phi$ Persei is a likely progenitor and that eccentric neutron star - white
dwarf systems are likely descendants. Late events can help explain the
discrepancy in the delay-time distributions derived from supernova remnants in
the Magellanic Clouds and extragalactic type Ia events, lowering the
contribution of prompt Ia events. We discuss ways to test these predictions and
speculate on the implications for supernova feedback in simulations of galaxy
evolution.

move away from their birth sites, the current dynamical information alone is
not sufficient for this task. The chemical composition of stellar atmospheres,
on the other hand, is largely preserved over the stellar lifetime and, together
with accurate ages, can be used to recover the birthplaces of stars currently
found at the same Galactic radius. In addition to the availability of large
stellar samples with accurate 6D kinematics and chemical abundance
measurements, this requires detailed modeling with both dynamical and chemical

processes. This AGN activity interacts with the neutral gas in compact radio
sources, which are believed to represent the young or recently re-triggered AGN
population. We present the results of a survey for HI absorption in a sample of
66 compact radio sources at 0.040 < z < 0.096 with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array. In total, we obtained seven detections, five of which are new,
with a large range of peak optical depths (3% to 87%). Of the detections, 71%
exhibit asymmetric, broad ($\Delta{v}_{\mathrm{FWHM}}$ > 100 km s$^{-1}$)
features, indicative of disturbed gas kinematics. Such broad, shallow and
offset features are also found within low-excitation radio galaxies which is
attributed to disturbed circumnuclear gas, consistent with early-type galaxies
typically devoid of a gas-rich disk. Comparing mid-infrared colours of our
galaxies with HI detections indicates that narrow and deep absorption features
are preferentially found in late-type and high-excitation radio galaxies in our
sample. These features are attributed to gas in galactic disks. By combining
XMM-Newton archival data with 21-cm data, we find support that absorbed X-ray
sources may be good tracers of HI content within the host galaxy. This sample
extends previous HI surveys in compact radio galaxies to lower radio
luminosities and provides a basis for future work exploring the higher redshift
universe.

widths (EWs) of CIV 1550\AA, Mg II 2800\AA, [OIII] 5007\AA\ and C III] 1909\AA.
We find that the emission line EW distributions in BAL and non-BAL quasars are
remarkably similar -- a property that is inconsistent with scenarios in which a
BAL outflow rises equatorially from a geometrically thin, optically thick
accretion disc. We construct simple models to predict the distributions from
various geometries; these models confirm the above finding and disfavour
equatorial geometries. We show that obscuration, line anisotropy and general
relativistic effects on the disc continuum are unlikely to hide an EW
inclination dependence. We carefully examine the radio and polarisation
properties of BAL quasars. Both suggest that they are most likely viewed (on
average) from intermediate inclinations, between type 1 and type 2 AGN. We also
find that the low-ionization BAL quasars in our sample are not confined to one
region of `Eigenvector I' parameter space. Overall, our work leads to one of
the following conclusions, or some combination thereof: (i) the continuum does
not emit like a geometrically thin, optically thick disc; (ii) BAL quasars are
viewed from similar angles to non-BAL quasars, i.e. low inclinations; (iii)
geometric unification does not explain the fraction of BALs in quasar samples.

general criteria for the detectability of neutrinos from powerful transient

minimal photon flux necessary for neutrino detection based on two main
observables, the bolometric luminosity and the time variability of the
emission. This limit can be compared to the observations in specified
wavelengths in order to target the most promising sources for follow-ups. Our
criteria can also help discriminating false associations of neutrino events
with a flaring source. We find that relativistic transient sources such as
High- and Low-Luminosity GRBs, Blazar flares, Tidal Disruption Events and
magnetar flares could be observed with IceCube, as they have a good chance to
occur within a detectable distance. Among non-relativistic transient sources,
only luminous supernovae appear as promising candidates. We caution that our
criterion should not be directly applied to low-luminosity GRBs and Type Ibc
supernovae, as these objects could have hosted a choked GRB, leading to
neutrino emission without a relevant counterpart radiation. We treat a set of
concrete examples and show that several transients, some of which are being
monitored by IceCube, are far from meeting the criterion for detectability

matter perturbations cancel, do not cause total matter isocurvature
perturbation. Consequently, at the linear order in the baryon density contrast
$\Delta$, CIP is not detectable by the CMB power spectra. At the second order
CIP smoothes the power spectra in a similar manner as lensing, causing a
degeneracy between the CIP variance $\Delta^2_{rms}=<\Delta^2>$ and lensing
parameter $A_L$. We show that the CMB lensing data breaks this degeneracy.
Nested sampling of the LCDM+CIP(+$A_L$) model, the Planck 2015 temperature,
polarization, and lensing data give $\Delta^2_{rms}=0.0069\pm0.0030$ at 68% CL.
A non-zero value is favored at 2.3$\sigma$. CIP with $\Delta^2_{rms}=0.007$
improves the bestfit $\chi^2$ by 3.6 compared to the adiabatic LCDM model. In
contrast, although the temperature data favor $A_L=1.22$, allowing $A_L\ne1$
does not improve the joint fit, since the lensing data disfavor $A_L\ne1$.
Indeed, CIP provides a rare example of a simple model, which can reduce the
Planck lensing anomaly by fitting well simultaneously the high multipole
temperature and lensing data, as well as the polarization data. Finally, we
derive forecasts for future satellite missions (LiteBIRD proposal to JAXA and
Exploring Cosmic Origins with CORE proposal to ESA's M5 call). Due to its
coarse angular resolution, LiteBIRD is not able to improve the constraints on
CIP or $A_L$, but CORE-M5 approaches the cosmic variance limit and improves the
CIP constraint to $\Delta^2_{rms}<0.0006\ (0.0014)$ at 68% (95%) CL, which is 9
times better than the current trispectrum based upper bound and 6 times better
than obtained from the simulated Planck data. In addition, CORE-M5 will
exquisitely distinguish between CIP and $A_L$. No matter whether CIP is allowed
for or not, the uncertainty of the lensing parameter will be
$\sigma(A_L)=0.012$.

non-Gaussian errors, where structural parameters may not be identified and
where reduced forms can be incompletely specified (or nonparametric). On level
control, we characterize the null distributions of all the test statistics.
Through conditioning and invariance arguments, we show that these distributions
do not involve nuisance parameters. In particular, this applies to several test
statistics for which no finite-sample distributional theory is yet available,
such as the standard statistic proposed by Hausman (1978). The distributions of
the test statistics may be non-standard -- so corrections to usual asymptotic
critical values are needed -- but the characterizations are sufficiently
explicit to yield finite-sample (Monte-Carlo) tests of the exogeneity
hypothesis. The procedures so obtained are robust to weak identification,
missing instruments or misspecified reduced forms, and can easily be adapted to
allow for parametric non-Gaussian error distributions. We give a general
invariance result (block triangular invariance) for exogeneity test statistics.
This property yields a convenient exogeneity canonical form and a parsimonious
reduction of the parameters on which power depends. In the extreme case where
no structural parameter is identified, the distributions under the alternative
hypothesis and the null hypothesis are identical, so the power function is
flat, for all the exogeneity statistics. However, as soon as identification
does not fail completely, this phenomenon typically disappears.

population than the primary one. We compared the estimated values of the
stellar and nebular extinctions derived from the synthesis method and the
H{\alpha}/H\b{eta} emission-line ratio finding that the nebular extinctions are
systematically higher than stellar ones by about a factor of 2. We did not find

applications require nanometer positioning accuracy, which is typically
achieved by low energy ion implantation. So far, a drawback of this technique
is the significant residual implantation-induced damage to the lattice, which
strongly degrades the performance of spins in quantum applications. In this
letter we show that the charge state of implantation-induced defects
drastically influences the formation of lattice defects during thermal
annealing. We demonstrate that charging of vacancies localized at e.g.
individual nitrogen implantation sites suppresses the formation of vacancy
complexes, resulting in a tenfold-improved spin coherence time of single
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. This has been achieved by confining
implantation defects into the space charge layer of free carriers generated by
a nanometer-thin boron-doped diamond structure. Besides, a twofold-improved
yield of formation of NV centers is observed. By combining these results with
numerical calculations, we arrive at a quantitative understanding of the
formation and dynamics of the implanted spin defects. The presented results
pave the way for improved engineering of diamond spin defect quantum devices
and other solid-state quantum systems.

ISM density. Using simple, yet standard SNR evolution models, we find that the
distribution of ambient densities is remarkably narrow; either the standard
assumptions about SNR evolution are wrong, or observable SNRs are biased to a
narrow range of ambient densities. We show that the size distributions are
consistent with log-normal, which severely limits the number of model
parameters in any SNR population synthesis model. Simple Monte Carlo
simulations demonstrate that the size distribution is indistinguishable from
log-normal when the SNR sample size is less than 600. This implies that these
SNR distributions provide only information on the mean and variance, yielding
additional information only when the sample size grows larger than $\sim{600}$
SNRs. To infer the parameters of the ambient density, we use Bayesian
statistical inference under the assumption that SNR evolution is dominated by
the Sedov phase. In particular, we use the SNR sizes and explosion energies to
estimate the mean and variance of the ambient medium surrounding SNR
progenitors. We find that the mean ISM particle density around our sample of
SNRs is $\mu_{\log{n}} = -1.33$, in $\log_{10}$ of particles per cubic
centimeter, with variance $\sigma^2_{\log{n}} = 0.49$. If interpreted at face
value, this implies that most SNRs result from supernovae propagating in the
warm, ionized medium. However, it is also likely that either SNR evolution is
not dominated by the simple Sedov evolution or SNR samples are biased to the
warm, ionized medium (WIM).

Maximum electron velocity in NGS is u=(okolo)1x 10^8 cm/s corresponding to the
light velocity. An effective mass of electrons in semiconductors is introduced
relating their velocity to quasimomentum. This mass depends on energy similarly
to the mass of relativistic electrons. In Hg_(1-x)Cd_(x)Te alloys one can reach
vanishing energy gap at which electrons and light holes are 3D massless Dirac
fermions. Wavelength lam_z is defined for NGS, in analogy to the Compton
wavelength, lam_z is around tens of Angstroms in semiconducting materials, in
agreement with tunneling experiments. Interband electron tunneling in NGS is in
close analogy to tunneling between negative and positive energies of the Dirac
equation. Relativistic analogy holds for orbital and spin properties of
electrons in an external magnetic field. The spin magnetic moment of both NGS
electrons and relativistic electrons approaches zero with increasing energy.
Electrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields are described. It is the
semirelativistic two-band description that gives a correct account of
experiments in this situation. A transverse Doppler shift is observed in
crossed fields indicating that there exists a time dilatation between an
electron and an observer. Phenomenon of Zitterbewegung (ZB, trembling motion)
for semiconductor electrons follows an analogy to free relativistic electrons.
Graphene, carbon nanotubes, topological insulators illustrate extreme
semirelativistic regime. Approximations and restrictions of the relativistic
analogy are emphasized. It is often easier to observe semirelativistic effects

relation, replicating previous studies, which showed no difference between the
sizes of centrals and satellites at fixed stellar mass, before turning our
attention to the size-core velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$) and mass-$\sigma_0$
relations. By comparing the median size and mass of the galaxies at fixed
velocity dispersion we find that the central galaxies are consistently larger
and more massive than their satellite counterparts in the quiescent population.
In the star forming population we find there is no difference in size and only
a small difference in mass. To analyse why these difference may be present we
investigate the radial mass profiles and stellar metallicity of the galaxies.
We find that in the cores of the galaxies there is no difference in mass
surface density between centrals and satellites, but there is a large
difference at larger radii. We also find almost no difference between the
stellar metallicity of centrals and satellites when they are separated into
star forming and quiescent groups. Under the assumption that $\sigma_0$ is
invariant to environmental processes, our results imply that central galaxies
are likely being increased in mass and size by processes such as minor mergers,
particularly at high $\sigma_0$, while satellites are being slightly reduced in
mass and size by tidal stripping and harassment, particularly at low
$\sigma_0$, all of which predominantly affect the outer regions of the

two approaches by Bravyi and Kitaev and the Auxiliary Fermion transformation.
The Bravyi-Kitaev transform is reformulated in terms of a classical data
structure and generalized to achieve a further locality improvement for local
fermionic models on a rectangular lattice. We conclude that the most compact
encoding of the fermionic operators can be done using ancilla qubits with the
Auxiliary Fermion scheme. Without introducing ancillas, a variant of the
Bravyi-Kitaev transform provides the most compact fermion-to-qubit mapping for
Hubbard-like models.

Ia supernova (SN Ia) remains highly uncertain. The degree of neutronization in
SN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the
metallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior
to the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization
using Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs).
Applying this method to \textit{Suzaku} data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397 and
G337.2$-$0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find
that the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho
and Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source
of neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to
infer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied
metallicities of 3C 397, G337.2$-$0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to
the local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that
progenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for
these SNRs. Although the relationship between ejecta neutronization and
equivalent progenitor metallicity is subject to uncertainties stemming from the
$^{12}$C$\,$+$^{16}$O reaction rate, which affects the Ca/S mass ratio, our
main results are not sensitive to these details.

by looking for a locally optimal state of the units in the nodes of a
pre-defined network, we search for extrema in the complex efficiency landscape
by finding locally optimal network topologies using a standard Monte Carlo
method.

channel-reciprocity based downlink (DL) transmission. To achieve large area
spectral efficiencies, we advocate the use of methods that rely on rudimentary
scheduling, decentralized operation at each RRH and user-centric DL
transmission.
  A slotted system is assumed, whereby users are randomly scheduled (e.g., via
shuffled round robin) in slots and across the limited pilot dimensions per
slot. As a result, multiple users in the vicinity of an RRH can simultaneously
transmit pilots on the same pilot dimension (and thus interfering with one
another). Each RRH performs rudimentary processing of the pilot observations in
""sectors"". In a sector, the RRH is able to resolve a scheduled user's channel
when that user is determined to be the only one among the scheduled users (on
the same pilot dimension) with significant received power in the sector.
Subsequently, only the subset of scheduled users whose channels are resolved in
at least one sector can be served by the system.
  We consider a spatially consistent evaluation of the area multiplexing gains
by means of a Poisson Point Process (PPP) problem formulation where RRHs,
blockers, scatterers and scheduled user terminals are all PPPs with individual
intensities. Also, we study directional training at the user terminals. Our
simulations suggest that, by controlling the intensity of the scheduled user
PPP and the user-pilot beam-width, many fold improvements can be expected in
area multiplexing gains with respect to conventional spatial pilot reuse
systems.

specific shapes. Developmental biology identified patterns of gene expression
and cytoskeletal regulation underlying local tissue dynamics, but how actions
of multiple domains of distinct cell types coordinate to remodel tissues at the
organ scale remains unclear. We use in toto light-sheet microscopy, automated
image analysis, and physical modeling to quantitatively investigate the link
between kinetics of global tissue transformations and force generation patterns
during Drosophila gastrulation. We find embryo-scale shape changes are
represented by a temporal sequence of three simple flow field configurations.
Each phase is accompanied by a characteristic spatial myosin distribution,
quantified in terms of a coarse-grained 'myosin tensor' that captures both
concentration and anisotropy. Our model assumes tissue flow is driven by stress
proportional to the myosin tensor, and is effectively visco-elastic with two
parameters that control 'irrotational' and 'divergence-less' components of the
flow. With just three global parameters, this model achieves up to 90%
agreement between predicted and measured flow. The analysis uncovers importance
of a) spatial modulation of myosin distribution and b) long-range spreading of
its effect due to mechanical interaction of cells. In particular, we find
germband extension phase is associated with the onset of effective areal
incompressibility of the epithelium, which makes the relation of flow and
myosin forcing strongly non-local. Our analysis also revealed a new function
for basal myosin in generating a dorsally directed flow and, combined with
mutant analysis, identified an unconventional control mechanism through twist
dependent reduction of basal myosin levels on the ventral side. We conclude
that understanding morphogenetic flow requires a fundamentally global
perspective.

graphs with a given degree sequence has many applications. One approach to this
problem uses a simple Markov chain, which we call the switch chain, to perform
the sampling. The switch chain is known to be rapidly mixing for regular degree
sequences, both in the undirected and directed setting.
  We prove that the switch chain for undirected graphs is rapidly mixing for
any degree sequence with minimum degree at least 1 and with maximum degree
$d_{\max}$ which satisfies $3\leq d_{\max}\leq \frac{1}{3}\, \sqrt{M}$, where
$M$ is the sum of the degrees. The mixing time bound obtained is only a factor
$n$ larger than that established in the regular case, where $n$ is the number
of vertices. Our result covers a wide range of degree sequences, including
power-law graphs with parameter $\gamma > 5/2$ and sufficiently many edges.
  For directed degree sequences such that the switch chain is irreducible, we
prove that the switch chain is rapidly mixing when all in-degrees and
out-degrees are positive and bounded above by $\frac{1}{4}\, \sqrt{m}$, where
$m$ is the number of arcs, and not all in-degrees and out-degrees equal 1. The
mixing time bound obtained in the directed case is an order of $m^2$ larger

been demonstrated that the learned discrepancy function can be used to improve
Reynolds stresses in different flows where data are not available. However,
owing to a number of challenges, the improvements have been demonstrated only
in the Reynolds stress prediction but not in the corresponding propagated
quantities of interest. In this work, we introduce the procedures toward a
complete PIML framework for predictive turbulence modeling, including learning
Reynolds stress discrepancy function, predicting Reynolds stresses in different
flows, and propagating to mean flow fields. The process of Reynolds stress
propagation and predictive accuracy of the propagated velocity field are
investigated. To improve the learning-prediction performance, the input
features are enriched based on an integrity basis of invariants. The fully
developed turbulent flow in a square duct is used as the test case. The
discrepancy model is trained on flow fields obtained from several Reynolds
numbers and evaluated on a duct flow at a Reynolds number higher than any of
the training cases. The predicted Reynolds stresses are propagated to velocity
field through RANS equations. Numerical results show excellent predictive
performances in both Reynolds stresses and their propagated velocities,
demonstrating the merits of the PIML approach in predictive turbulence

this representation is not well adapted for the evolution of the planetary
orbits in the solar system over million of years as they present drifts in
their main frequencies, due to the chaotic nature of their dynamics. The aim of
the present paper is to develop a numerical algorithm for slowly diffusing
solutions of a perturbed integrable Hamiltonian system that will apply to the
representation of the chaotic planetary motions with varying frequencies. By
simple analytical considerations, we first argue that it is possible to recover
exactly a single varying frequency. Then, a function basis involving
time-dependent fundamental frequencies is formulated in a semi-analytical way.
Finally, starting from a numerical solution, a recursive algorithm is used to
numerically decompose the solution on the significant elements of the function
basis. Simple examples show that this algorithm can be used to give compact
representations of different types of slowly diffusing solutions. As a test
example, we show how this algorithm can be successfully applied to obtain a
very compact approximation of the La2004 solution of the orbital motion of the
Earth over 40 Myr ([-35Myr,5Myr]). This example has been chosen as this
solution is widely used for the reconstruction of the climates of the past.

$(U|U+V)$ constructions with Reed-Solomon code or algebraic geometry code
components. These codes are decoded with a recursive computation of the {\em a
posteriori} probabilities of the code symbols together with the Koetter-Vardy
soft decoder used for decoding the code components in polynomial time. We show
that when the number of levels of the iterated $(U|U+V)$ construction tends to
infinity, we attain the capacity of any discrete symmetric channel in this way.
This result follows from the polarization theorem together with a simple lemma
explaining how the Koetter-Vardy decoder behaves for Reed-Solomon codes of rate
close to $1$. However, even if this way of attaining the capacity of a
symmetric channel is essentially the Ar{\i}kan polarization theorem, there are
some differences with standard polar codes.
  Indeed, with this strategy we can operate succesfully close to channel
capacity even with a small number of levels of the iterated $(U|U+V)$
construction and the probability of error decays quasi-exponentially with the
codelength in such a case (i.e. exponentially if we forget about the
logarithmic terms in the exponent). We can even improve on this result by
considering the algebraic geometry codes constructed in \cite{TVZ82}. In such a
case, the probability of error decays exponentially in the codelength for any
rate below the capacity of the channel. Moreover, when comparing this strategy
to Reed-Solomon codes (or more generally algebraic geometry codes) decoded with
the Koetter-Vardy decoding algorithm, it does not only improve the noise level
that the code can tolerate, it also results in a significant complexity gain.

bias on real-world problems. In this paper, we show that this representation
bias can be greatly reduced by discretization. Discretization is a common
procedure in machine learning that is used to convert a quantitative attribute
into a qualitative one. It is often motivated by the limitation of some
learners to qualitative data. Discretization loses information, as fewer
distinctions between instances are possible using discretized data relative to
undiscretized data. In consequence, where discretization is not essential, it
might appear desirable to avoid it. However, it has been shown that
discretization often substantially reduces the error of the linear generative
Bayesian classifier naive Bayes. This motivates a systematic study of the
effectiveness of discretizing quantitative attributes for other linear
classifiers. In this work, we study the effect of discretization on the
performance of linear classifiers optimizing three distinct discriminative
objective functions --- logistic regression (optimizing negative
log-likelihood), support vector classifiers (optimizing hinge loss) and a
zero-hidden layer artificial neural network (optimizing mean-square-error). We

limit the portability of the applications and increase development complexity

In projection on the sky, the CNM exhibits highly filamentary distribution with
a sub-pc width, whereas the WNM shows smooth extended distribution. In the HI
optical depth the CNM is dominant and the contribution of the WNM is negligibly
small. The CNM has an area covering factor of 30% in projection, while the WNM

which are significantly affected by the small-scale large fluctuations of the

found it to be the dominant source of nuclear effects, significantly exceeding
the effects of leading twist gluon shadowing and energy loss. Moreover, this
contribution turns out to be the most reliably predicted, relying on the
precise measurements of the dipole cross section at HERA. The nuclear
suppression of quarkonia has been anticipated to become stronger with energy,
because the dipole cross section steeply rises. However, the measured nuclear
effects remain essentially unchanged within the energy range from RHIC to the

yield. Nuclear effects for the production of $J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$,

ambiguity of the energy spectrum of individual composition. Recently, direct
measurements from several balloon/satellite-borne detectors found significant
spectral hardenings of cosmic ray nuclei at a few hundred GV rigidities. A
joint modeling of the direct and indirect measurements of the cosmic ray
spectra may help to understand the experimental systematics and probably the
physics of the knee. In this work, we update the phenomenological ""poly-gonato""
model of the knee to include the spectral hardenings, with a changing spectral
index of $\gamma + \beta \cdot \log E$ with respect to energy. We find that
there is some tension between the direct and indirect measurements.
Specifically, the hard spectra of CREAM suggest a relatively low energy cutoff
of the individual cosmic ray spectrum around the knee, which is inconsistent
with the light component spectra of the air shower measurements. Furthermore,
the light component data from AS$\gamma$/ARGO-YBJ/WFCTA/KASCADE are consistent
with the all-particle spectra. We expect that more precise measurements of the
cosmic ray spectrum of individual composition at TeV energies and beyond by the
operating space detectors such as CALET and DAMPE, and the ground based
experiments such as LHAASO, will eventually solve these discrepancies. Finally,

into representations in which behaviorally meaningful properties of the
environment are made explicit. These representations are derived through
cascades of neuronal processing stages in which neurons at each stage recode
the output of preceding stages. Explanations of sensory coding may thus involve
understanding how low-level patterns are combined into more complex structures.
Although models exist in the visual domain to explain how mid-level features
such as junctions and curves might be derived from oriented filters in early
visual cortex, little is known about analogous grouping principles for
mid-level auditory representations. We propose a hierarchical generative model
of natural sounds that learns combinations of spectrotemporal features from
natural stimulus statistics. In the first layer the model forms a sparse
convolutional code of spectrograms using a dictionary of learned
spectrotemporal kernels. To generalize from specific kernel activation
patterns, the second layer encodes patterns of time-varying magnitude of
multiple first layer coefficients. Because second-layer features are sensitive
to combinations of spectrotemporal features, the representation they support
encodes more complex acoustic patterns than the first layer. When trained on
corpora of speech and environmental sounds, some second-layer units learned to
group spectrotemporal features that occur together in natural sounds. Others
instantiate opponency between dissimilar sets of spectrotemporal features. Such
groupings might be instantiated by neurons in the auditory cortex, providing a
hypothesis for mid-level neuronal computation.

  From the algebraic point of view it is only natural to work with a general
field extension K/k of degree 2 instead of the fields of real and complex
number (under the assumption that the characteristic is not equal to 2). Given
a k-linear map between two K-vector spaces of dimension 1 over K, there are two
natural measures of deviation of this map from being K-linear: its conformal
dilatation, defined in terms of quadratic forms over k, and its Beltrami form,
directly generalizing the classical complex dilatation. It turns out that these
two measures are related in the same way as in the classical case. Working with
a general field extension does not lead to any new difficulties compared to the
classical case, but only clarifies the algebraic aspects of the theory.

that if $r^-(T)\leq 2$ or $r^+(T)\geq 5$, then Keller's conjecture is true for
$d=7$. In the paper we show that it is also true for $d=7$ if $r^+(T)=4$. Thus,
if $[0,1)^7+T$ is a counterexample to Keller's conjecture, then $r^+(T)=3$,

horizontally on the cleaved sidewall or at an oblique angle on the top metal

homologous nitrile, butyl cyanide (C$_4$H$_9$CN). We also investigate whether
other molecules will show a similar degree of branching, by modeling alkanes up
to pentane (C$_5$H$_{12}$). We use a coupled three-phase chemical kinetics
model to simulate the chemistry of Sgr B2(N2), using an updated chemical
network that includes grain-surface/ice-mantle formation routes for branched
nitriles and alkanes. We use the EMoCA survey data to search for the
straight-chain form of butyl cyanide toward Sgr B2(N2). The observed $i$:$n$
ratio for propyl cyanide is reproduced by the models. Butyl cyanide is
predicted to show similar abundances to propyl cyanide, and to exhibit strong
branching, with the $sec$ form clearly dominant over all others. The addition
of CN to acetylene and ethene is found to be important to the production of
vinyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl cyanide. We report a non-detection of
$n$-C$_4$H$_9$CN toward Sgr B2(N2), with an abundance at least 1.7 times lower
than that of $n$-C$_3$H$_7$CN. This value is within the range predicted by the
chemical models. The models indicate that the degree of branching rises with
increasing molecular size. The efficiency of CN addition to unsaturated
hydrocarbons boosts the abundances of nitriles in the model, and enhances the
ratio of straight-to-branched molecule production. The predicted abundance of
$s$-C$_4$H$_9$CN makes it a good candidate for future detection toward Sgr
B2(N2).

triggered sources diffuses outward from each source, activating new sources and
enabling a mechanism of flame propagation. Systems of $40000$ sources in a

and statistical ensembles of $120$ realizations of each system were averaged to
determine the statistical properties of the flame fronts. The reactive system
of sources is parameterized by two non-dimensional values: The heat release
time (normalized by interparticle diffusion time) and the ignition temperature
(normalized by adiabatic flame temperature). These two parameters were
systematically varied for different simulations to investigate their influence
on front propagation. For sufficiently fast heat release and low ignition
temperature, the front roughness (defined as the RMS deviation of the ignition
temperature contour from the average flame position) grew following a power law
dependence that was in excellent agreement with the KPZ universality class
($\beta = 1/3$). As the reaction time was increased, lower values of the
roughening exponent were observed, and at a sufficiently great value of

constructing robust numerical methods to study fluid-structure interaction in
problems involving an elastic structure immersed in a viscous fluid. The IB
formulation uses an Eulerian representation of the fluid and a Lagrangian
representation of the structure. The Lagrangian and Eulerian frames are coupled
by integral transforms with delta function kernels. The discretized IB
equations use approximations to these transforms with regularized delta
function kernels to interpolate the fluid velocity to the structure, and to
spread structural forces to the fluid. It is well-known that the conventional
IB method can suffer from poor volume conservation since the interpolated
Lagrangian velocity field is not generally divergence-free, and so this can
cause spurious volume changes. In practice, the lack of volume conservation is
especially pronounced for cases where there are large pressure differences
across thin structural boundaries. The aim of this paper is to greatly reduce
the volume error of the IB method by introducing velocity-interpolation and
force-spreading schemes with the properties that the interpolated velocity
field in which the structure moves is at least C1 and satisfies a continuous
divergence-free condition, and that the force-spreading operator is the adjoint
of the velocity-interpolation operator. We confirm through numerical
experiments in two and three spatial dimensions that this new IB method is able
to achieve substantial improvement in volume conservation compared to other
existing IB methods, at the expense of a modest increase in the computational
cost. Further, the new method provides smoother Lagrangian forces (tractions)
than traditional IB methods. The method presented here is restricted to
periodic computational domains. Its generalization to non-periodic domains is
important future work.

systems, the face alignment module is implemented independently. This has
actually caused difficulties in the designing and training of end-to-end face
recognition models. In this paper we study the possibility of alignment
learning in end-to-end face recognition, in which neither prior knowledge on
facial landmarks nor artificially defined geometric transformations are
required. Specifically, spatial transformer layers are inserted in front of the
feature extraction layers in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face
recognition. Only human identity clues are used for driving the neural network
to automatically learn the most suitable geometric transformation and the most
appropriate facial area for the recognition task. To ensure reproducibility,

access to the excited state spectrum of QCD. At zero momentum, these techniques
are well established and can cleanly isolate energy eigenstates of either
positive or negative parity. In order to compute the form factors of a single
energy eigenstate, we must perform a variational analysis at non-zero momentum.
When we do this with baryons, we run into issues with parity mixing, as boosted
baryons are not eigenstates of parity. The parity-expanded variational analysis
(PEVA) technique is a novel method for ensuring the successful and consistent
isolation of boosted baryon eigenstates. This is achieved through a parity
expansion of the operator basis used to construct the correlation matrix.
World-first calculations of excited state nucleon form factors using this new
technique are presented, showing the improvement over conventional methods.

to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious
URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal
formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and
categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses
different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design,

makes use of the iterative preconditioned GMRES algorithm for solving the

system of equations, one can obtain a method which is much less computationally
expensive than the untransformed formulation, and which compares competitively
with other time-integration schemes, such as diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta
(DIRK) methods. We develop and test several ILU-based preconditioners effective
for these large systems. We additionally employ a parallel-in-time strategy to
compute the Runge-Kutta stages simultaneously. Numerical experiments are
performed on the Navier-Stokes equations using Euler vortex and 2D and 3D NACA
airfoil test cases in serial and in parallel settings. The fully implicit Radau

to extract work from a system. Initially, the working substance of SZE was
considered to be a single particle. Later on, researchers has extended the
studies of SZE to multi-particle systems and even to quantum regime. Here we
present a detailed study of classical SZE consisting of $N$ particles with
inter-particle interactions, i.e., the working substance is a low density
non-ideal gas and compare the work extraction with respect to SZE with
non-interacting multi particle system as working substance. We have considered
two cases of interactions namely: (i) hard core interactions and (ii) square
well interaction. Our study reveals that work extraction is less when more
particles are interacting through hard core interactions. More work is
extracted when the particles are interacting via square well interaction.
Another important result for the second case is that as we increase the
particle number the work extraction becomes independent of the initial position
of the partition, as opposed to the first case. Work extraction depends
crucially on the initial position of the partition. More work can be extracted
with larger number of particles when partition is inserted at positions near
the boundary walls.

decoupling from the container under rotation. Similarly, the resonant period
drop of a torsional oscillator (TO) containing solid helium was first
interpreted as the decoupling of solid from the TO and appearance of
supersolid. However, the resonant period can be changed by mechanisms other
than supersolid, such as the elastic stiffening of solid helium that is widely
accepted as the reason for the TO response. To demonstrate the irrotational
nature more directly, the previous experiments superimposed the dc rotation
onto the TO and revealed strong suppression on the TO response without
affecting the shear modulus. This result is inconsistent with the simple
temperature-dependent elasticity model and supports the supersolid scenario.
Here, we re-examine the rotational effect on solid helium with a two-frequency
rigid TO to clarify the conflicting observations. Surprisingly, most of the
result of previous rotation experiments were not reproduced. Instead, we found
a very interesting superfluid-like irrotational response that cannot be
explained by elastic models.

exploit the relationship between labels in multi-label learning problems. We
suggest that for each individual label, it cannot only be implicitly connected
with other labels via the low-rank constraint over label predictors, but also
its performance on examples can receive the explicit comments from other labels
together acting as an \emph{Oracle teacher}. We generate privileged label
feature for each example and its individual label, and then integrate it into
the framework of low-rank based multi-label learning. The proposed algorithm
can therefore comprehensively explore and exploit label relationships by
inheriting all the merits of privileged information and low-rank constraints.
We show that PrML can be efficiently solved by dual coordinate descent
algorithm using iterative optimization strategy with cheap updates. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that through privileged label features, the
performance can be significantly improved and PrML is superior to several
competing methods in most cases.

into account the effect of mass exchange between these two gas components

actually produce a variety in cold gas mass and dust-to-gas ratio. By comparing
with an observational sample of nearby elliptical galaxies, we find that,
although the dust-to-gas ratio varies by an order of magnitude in our model,
the entire range of the observed dust-to-gas ratios is difficult to be
reproduced under a single parameter set. Variation of the dust growth
efficiency is the most probable solution to explain the large variety in
dust-to-gas ratio of the observational sample. Therefore, dust growth can play
a central role in creating the variation in dust-to-gas ratio through the AGN
feedback cycle and through the variation in dust growth efficiency.

We study a formalized version of this problem, wherein the goal is, given a

degree of the sampled nodes. Depending on the sampling scheme, trivial method
of moments estimators (MMEs) can be used. However, the MME is not expected, in
general, to use all relevant network information. In this study, we propose a
handful of novel estimators derived from a risk-theoretic perspective, which
make more sophisticated use of the information in the sampled network.
Theoretical assessment of the new estimators characterizes under what
conditions they can offer improvement over the MME, while numerical comparisons
show that when such improvement obtains, it can be substantial. Illustration is

retarded Green functions on causal sets in 2 and 4 dimensions. As in the
continuum, the massive Green function can be obtained from the massless one,
and hence the key task in causal set theory is to first identify the massless
Green function. We propose that the 2-d model provides a Green function for the
massive scalar field on causal sets approximated by any topologically trivial 2
dimensional spacetime. We explicitly demonstrate that this is indeed the case
in a Riemann normal neighbourhood. In 4-d the model can again be used to
provide a Green function for the massive scalar field in a Riemann normal
neighbourhood which we compare to Bunch and Parker's continuum Green function.
We find that the same prescription can also be used for deSitter spacetime and
the conformally flat patch of anti deSitter spacetime. Our analysis then allows
us to suggest a generalisation of Johnston's model for the Green function for a
causal set approximated by 3 dimensional flat spacetime.

requires the collection of calibration data for new subjects prior to online
use. Calibration time can be reduced or eliminated e.g.~by transfer of a
pre-trained classifier or unsupervised adaptive classification methods which
learn from scratch and adapt over time. While such heuristics work well in
practice, none of them can provide theoretical guarantees. Our objective is to
modify an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to work in unison with the
machine learning decoder to achieve a reliable calibration-less decoding with a
guarantee to recover the true class means.
  Method: We introduce learning from label proportions (LLP) to the BCI
community as a new unsupervised, and easy-to-implement classification approach
for ERP-based BCIs. The LLP estimates the mean target and non-target responses
based on known proportions of these two classes in different groups of the
data. We modified a visual ERP speller to meet the requirements of the LLP. For
evaluation, we ran simulations on artificially created data sets and conducted
an online BCI study with N=13 subjects performing a copy-spelling task.
  Results: Theoretical considerations show that LLP is guaranteed to minimize
the loss function similarly to a corresponding supervised classifier. It
performed well in simulations and in the online application, where 84.5% of
characters were spelled correctly on average without prior calibration.
  Significance: The continuously adapting LLP classifier is the first
unsupervised decoder for ERP BCIs guaranteed to find the true class means. This
makes it an ideal solution to avoid a tedious calibration and to tackle
non-stationarities in the data. Additionally, LLP works on complementary
principles compared to existing unsupervised methods, allowing for their
further enhancement when combined with LLP.

to the high symmetry cubic directions $[001], [1\bar{1}0]$ and $[111]$, the
refined field induced magnetic structures are derived from the zero field
$\psi_2$ and $\psi_3$ states of the $\Gamma_5$ irreducible representation which
describes the ground state of XY pyrochlore antiferromagnets. At low field,
domain selection effects are systematically at play. In addition, for $[001]$,
a phase transition is reported towards a $\psi_3$ structure at a characteristic
field $H_c^{001}=$ 43 mT. For $[1\bar{1}0]$ and $[111]$, the spins are
continuously tilted by the field from the $\psi_2$ state, and no phase
transition is found while domain selection gives rise to sharp anomalies in the
field dependence of the Bragg peaks intensity. For $[1\bar{1}0]$, these results
are confirmed by high resolution inelastic neutron scattering experiments,
which in addition allow us to determine the field dependence of the spin gap.
This study agrees qualitatively with the scenario proposed theoretically by

astronomers with a set of spectroscopic data of realistic interstellar dust
analogues that can be used to interpret the observations. Glassy silicates of
mean composition (1-x)MgO - xSiO2 with x = 0.35, 0.40 and 0.50 were
synthesized. The mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of the samples was measured
in the spectral domain 30 - 1000 $\mu$m for grain temperature in the range 300
K - 10 K and at room temperature in the 5 - 40 $\mu$m domain. We find that the
MAC of all samples varies with the grains temperature. In the FIR/submm, and
above 30K, the MAC value at a given wavelength increases with the temperature
as thermally activated absorption processes appear. The studied materials
exhibit different and complex behaviors at long wavelengths (lambda $\geq$ 200
to 700 $\mu$m depending on the samples) and the MAC cannot be approximated by a
single power law in ${\lambda}^{-\beta}$. These behaviors are attributed to the
amorphous nature of dust and to the amount and nature of the defects within
this amorphous structure. Above 20 $\mu$m, the measured MAC are much higher
than the MAC calculated from interstellar silicate dust models indicating that
the analogues measured in this study are more emissive than the silicates in
cosmic dust models. This has important astrophysical implications because
masses are overestimated by the models. Moreover, constraints on elemental
abundance of heavy elements in cosmic dust models are relaxed

Early theories provide estimates of the heat of transport at infinite dilution.
These values are used to interpret thermodiffusion (Soret) and thermoelectric
(Seebeck) effects. However, accessing heats of transport of individual ions at
finite concentration remains an outstanding question both theoretically and
experimentally. Here we discuss a computational approach to calculate heats of
transport of aqueous solutions at finite concentrations, and apply our method
to study lithium chloride solutions at concentrations $>0.5$~M. The heats of
transport are significantly different for Li$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions, unlike what
is expected at infinite dilution. We find theoretical evidence for the
existence of minima in the Soret coefficient of LiCl, where the magnitude of
the heat of transport is maximized. The Seebeck coefficient obtained from the
ionic heats of transport varies significantly with temperature and
concentration. We identify thermodynamic conditions leading to a maximization
of the thermoelectric response of aqueous solutions.

superradiance, overspinning occurs in a narrow range of frequencies bounded

However, our inability to properly model the upper-most region of solar-like
stars prevents us from making the best of these observations. This problem is
called ""surface effect"" and a key ingredient to solve it is turbulent pressure
for the computation of both the equilibrium models and the oscillations. While
3D hydrodynamic simulations help to include properly the turbulent pressure in
the equilibrium models, the way this surface effect is included in the
computation of stellar oscillations is still subject to uncertainties. We aim
at determining how to properly include the effect of turbulent pressure and its
Lagrangian perturbation in the adiabatic computation of the oscillations. We
also discuss the validity of the gas-gamma model (GGM) and reduced gamma model
(RGM) approximations, which have been used to compute adiabatic oscillations of
equilibrium models including turbulent pressure. We use a patched model of the
Sun with an inner part constructed by a 1D stellar evolution code (CESTAM) and
an outer part by the 3D hydrodynamical code (CO$^5$BOLD). Then, the adiabatic
oscillations are computed using the ADIPLS code for the GGM and RGM and with
the MAD code imposing the adiabatic condition on an existing time-dependent
convection (TDC) formalism. We show that the computation of the oscillations
using the TDC formalism in the adiabatic limit improves significantly the
agreement with the observed frequencies compared to the GGM and RGM. Of the
components of the turbulent pressure perturbation, the perturbation of the
density and advection term is found to contribute most to the frequency shift.
We propose a formalism to evaluate the frequency shift due to the inclusion of
the term with the turbulent pressure perturbation in the variational principle
in order to extrapolate our result to other stars.

transmission of digital encryption keys, assuming that the behaviour of the
devices employed for the key exchange can be reliably modelled and predicted.
Remarkably, no assumptions have to be made on the capabilities of an
eavesdropper other than that she is bounded by the laws of Nature, thus making
the security of QKD ""unconditional"". However, unconditional security is hard to
achieve in practice. For example, any experimental realisation can only collect
finite data samples, leading to vulnerabilities against coherent attacks, the
most general class of attacks, and for some protocols the theoretical proof of
robustness against these attacks is still missing. For these reasons, in the
past many QKD experiments have fallen short of implementing an unconditionally
secure protocol and have instead considered limited attacking capabilities by
the eavesdropper. Here, we explore the security of QKD against coherent attacks
in the most challenging environment: the long-distance transmission of keys. We
demonstrate that the BB84 protocol can provide positive key rates for distances
up to 240 km without multiplexing of conventional signals, and up to 200 km
with multiplexing. Useful key rates can be achieved even for the longest
distances, using practical thermo-electrically cooled single-photon detectors.

and asymptotically distributed as standard normal under the null. We use these
test statistics within the Haar wavelet transform at each scale and location,
referring to them as the likelihood ratio Haar (LRH) coefficients of the data.
In the denoising algorithm, the LRH coefficients are used as thresholding
decision statistics, which enables the use of thresholds suitable for i.i.d.
Gaussian noise, despite the standard Haar coefficients of the signal being
heteroscedastic. In the variance-stabilizing and normalizing algorithm, the LRH
coefficients replace the standard Haar coefficients in the Haar basis
expansion. To the best of our knowledge, the variance-stabilizing and

revealed that MWC 656 is a quiescent high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), opening the
possibility to explore X-ray/radio correlations and the accretion/ejection
coupling down to low luminosities for BH HMXBs. Here we report on a deep joint
Chandra/VLA observation of MWC 656 (and contemporaneous optical data) conducted
in 2015 July that has allowed us to unambiguously identify the X-ray
counterpart of the source. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a power law
with $\Gamma\sim2$, providing a flux of $\simeq4\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-8 keV energy range and a luminosity of $L_{\rm
X}\simeq3\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a 2.6 kpc distance. For a 5 M$_\odot$
BH this translates into $\simeq5\times10^{-9}$ $L_{\rm Edd}$. These results
imply that MWC 656 is about 7 times fainter in X-rays than it was two years
before and reaches the faintest X-ray luminosities ever detected in
stellar-mass BHs. The radio data provide a detection with a peak flux density
of $3.5\pm1.1$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The obtained X-ray/radio luminosities for
this quiescent BH HMXB are fully compatible with those of the X-ray/radio
correlations derived from quiescent BH low-mass X-ray binaries. These results
show that the accretion/ejection coupling in stellar-mass BHs is independent of

curve shows a smooth decline consistent with radioactive decay, except over
~450 to ~600 days where the light curve appears to decrease faster than
expected based on the radioactive isotopes presumed to be present, before
flattening at around 600 days. We model the 200-1600d pseudo-bolometric light

$^{56}$Ni, $^{57}$Ni and $^{55}$Co, and find it is not consistent with models
that have full positron trapping and no infrared catastrophe (IRC); some
additional energy escape other than optical/near-IR photons is required.
However, the light curve is consistent with models that allow for positron
escape (reaching 75% by day 500) and/or an IRC (with 85% of the flux emerging

significant near-infrared excess in roughly two dozen systems, i.$\,$e. around
$10\,\%$ to $30\,\%$ of stars surveyed. This excess is attributed to dust
located in the immediate vicinity of the star, the origin of which is highly
debated. We used previously published interferometric observations to constrain
the properties and distribution of this hot dust. Considering both scattered
radiation and thermal reemission, we modelled the observed excess in nine of
these systems. We find that grains have to be sufficiently absorbing to be
consistent with the observed excess, while dielectric grains with pure silicate
compositions fail to reproduce the observations. The dust should be located
within $\sim\,0.01-1\,au$ from the star depending on its luminosity.
Furthermore, we find a significant trend for the disc radius to increase with
the stellar luminosity. The dust grains are determined to be below
$0.2-0.5\,\mu\textrm{m}$, but above $0.02-0.15\,\mu\textrm{m}$ in radius. The
dust masses amount to $(0.2-3.5)\times10^{-9}\,M_\oplus$. The near-infrared
excess is probably dominated by thermal reemission, though a contribution of
scattered light up to $35\,\%$ cannot be completely excluded. The polarisation
degree predicted by our models is always below $5\,\%$, and for grains smaller
than $\sim0.2\,\mu\textrm{m}$ even below $1\,\%$. We also modelled the observed
near-infrared excess of another ten systems with poorer data in the
mid-infrared. The basic results for these systems appear qualitatively similar,
yet the constraints on the dust location and the grain sizes are weaker.

nature of dark matter is still unknown. The standard Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle(WIMP) dark matter, despite successfully explaining the large-scale
features of the universe, has long-standing small-scale issues. The spectral
distortion in the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) caused by Silk damping in
the pre-recombination era allows one to access information on a range of small
scales $0.3 \, {\rm Mpc} < k < 10^4 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$, whose dynamics can be
precisely described using linear theory. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of using the Silk damping induced CMB spectral distortion as a
probe of the small-scale power. We consider four suggested alternative dark
matter candidates---Warm Dark Matter (WDM), Late Forming Dark Matter, Ultra
Light Axion dark matter and Charged Decaying Dark Matter; the matter power in
all these models deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$CDM model at small
scales. We compute the spectral distortion of CMB for these alternative models
and compare our results with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We show that the main
impact of alternative models is to alter the sub-horizon evolution of the
Newtonian potential which affects the late-time behaviour of spectral
distortion of CMB. The $y$-parameter diminishes by a few percent as compared to
the $\Lambda$CDM model for a range of parameters of these models: LFDM for
formation redshift $z_f = 10^5$ (7\%); WDM for mass $m_{\rm wdm} = 1 \, \rm
keV$ (2\%); CHDM for decay redshift $z_{\rm decay} = 10^5$ (5\%); ULA for mass
$m_a = 10^{-24} \, \rm eV$ (3\%). We also briefly discuss the detectability of
this deviation in light of the upcoming CMB experiment PIXIE, which might have
the sensitivity to detect this signal from the pre-recombination phase.

the population by type, called the allelic partition. The main object of this
work is the frequency spectrum $A(k,t)$ which counts the number of families of

However, to date, studies of these effects focus on quantum systems that are
weakly interacting with their environment. In this paper, we investigate what
happens to a quantum system under the action of repeated measurements if the
quantum system is strongly interacting with its environment. We consider as the
quantum system a single two-level system coupled strongly to a collection of
harmonic oscillators. A so-called polaron transformation is then used to make
the problem in the strong system-environment coupling regime tractable. We find
that the strong coupling case exhibits quantitative and qualitative differences
as compared with the weak coupling case. In particular, the effective decay
rate does not depend linearly on the spectral density of the environment. This
then means that, in the strong coupling regime that we investigate, increasing
the system-environment coupling strength can actually decrease the effective
decay rate. We also consider a collection of two-level atoms coupled strongly
with a common environment. In this case, we find that there are further
differences between the weak and strong coupling cases since the two-level
atoms can now indirectly interact with one another due to the common
environment.

association by providing dedicated model predictions for the nonthermal photon
emission spectrum of WR 11. We use three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic
modeling to trace the structure and conditions of the wind-collision region of

radiative braking in the stellar winds. A transport equation is then solved in
the wind-collision region to determine the population of relativistic electrons

components. We find that - if WR 11 be indeed confirmed as the responsible
object for the observed gamma-ray emission - its radiation will unavoidably be
of hadronic origin owing to the strong radiation fields in the binary system
which inhibit the acceleration of electrons to energies suffciently high for
observable inverse Compton radiation. Different conditions in wind-collision

simulations, with a test-particle approach. We use magnetohydrodynamic
simulations to determine the background conditions in the wind collision
region. This allows us to consider particle acceleration at both shocks, on
either side of the WCR, with a self-consistently determined large-scale
magnetic field, which has an impact on the shape of the WCR, and the topology
of which plays an important role in particle acceleration at collisionless
shocks. Such studies may contribute to improve $\gamma$-ray flux predictions
for CWB systems.

In particular, applications need to adapt their interaction modalities to
different portable devices. In this paper we address the problem of defining
models and techniques for designing internet based applications that
automatically adapt to different mobile devices. First, we define a formal
model that allows for specifying the interaction in a way that is abstract
enough to be decoupled from the presentation layer, which is to be adapted to
different contexts. The model is mainly based on the idea of describing the
user interaction in terms of elementary actions. Then, we provide a formal
device characterization showing how to effectively implements the AIUs in a

radio emitter, we investigated about the presence and the properties of a
non-thermal component. Methods: We observed IRAS 17020+4544 with the Very Long
Baseline Array at 5, 8, 15, and 24 GHz within a month of the 2014 XMM-Newton
observations. We further analysed archival data taken in 2000 and 2012.
Results: We detect the source at 5 GHz and on short baselines at 8 GHz. At 15
and 24 GHz, the source is below our baseline sensitivity for fringe fitting,
indicating the lack of prominent compact features. The morphology is that of an
asymmetric double, with significant diffuse emission. The spectrum between 5
and 8 GHz is rather steep ($S(\nu)\sim\nu^{-(1.0\pm0.2)}$). Our re-analysis of
the archival data at 5 and 8 GHz provides results consistent with the new
observations, suggesting that flux density and structural variability are not
important in this source. We put a limit on the separation speed between the
main components of $<0.06c$. Conclusions: IRAS 17020+4544 shows interesting
features of several classes of objects: its properties are typical of compact
steep spectrum sources, low power compact sources, radio-emitting narrow line
Seyfert 1 galaxies. However, it can not be classified in any of these
categories, remaining so far a one-of-a-kind object.

(2D) materials with TCI phase are explored much less than 3D TCIs and 2D
topological insulator, while so far considered 2D TCIs almost exclusively
possess a square lattice structure with the mirror Chern number $\mathcal C_{M}

semimetal Na$_3$Bi is a 2D TCI with a mirror Chern number $\mathcal C_{M} =-1$.
The large nontrivial gap of 0.31 eV is tunable and can be made much larger via
strain engineering while the topological phases are robust against strain,
indicating a high possibility for room-temperature observation of quantized
conductance. In addition, a nonzero spin Chern number $\mathcal C_{S} =-1$ is
obtained, indicating the coexistence of 2D topological insulator and 2D TCI,
i.e. the dual topological character. Remarkably, a spin-valley polarization is
revealed in Na$_3$Bi monolayer due to the breaking of crystal inversion
symmetry. The dual topological character is further explicitly confirmed via
unusual edge states' behavior under corresponding symmetry breaking.

and F160W=19.4 mag (both 0.12 $M_\odot$) in the infrared throughout the field
of view. We had previously reported that the core of Wd2 consists of two
clumps: namely the main cluster (MC) and the northern clump (NC). From the
spatial distribution of the completeness corrected population, we find that
their stellar surface densities are 1114 stars pc$^{-2}$ and 555 stars
pc$^{-2}$, respectively, down to F814W=21.8 mag. We find that the present-day
mass function (PDMF) of Wd2 has a slope of $\Gamma=-1.46 \pm 0.06$, which
translates to a total stellar cluster mass of $(3.6 \pm 0.3) \cdot 10^4
M_\odot$. The spatial analysis of the PDMF reveals that the cluster population
is mass-segregated, most likely primordial. In addition, we report the
detection of a stellar population of spatially uniformly distributed low-mass
(<0.15 $M_\odot$) stars, extending into the gas ridges of the surrounding gas
and dust cloud, as well as a confined region of reddened stars, likely caused
by a foreground CO cloud. We find hints that a cloud-cloud collision might be

this, we recalibrate the halo mass function with non-linear characteristic

is a result of manufacturing variations. This randomness can be translated into
the cryptographic keys thus avoiding the need to store and manage the device
cryptographic keys. Therefore these properties, combined with the fact that
SRAM memory can be often found in today's IoT devices, make SRAM-PUFs a
promising candidate for securing and authentication of the resource-constrained
IoT devices. PUF observations are always effected by noise and environmental
changes. Therefore secret-generation schemes with helper data are used to
guarantee reliable regeneration of the PUF-based secret keys. Error correction

probability of $10^{-9}$ or lower for a practical SRAM-PUFs setting with bit
error probability of $15\%$. The method is based on successive cancellation
combined with list decoding and hash-based checking that makes use of the hash

resolution point clouds representing anatomical surfaces. Raw images are in the
form of triangulated surfaces and the first step is to create a standardised
representation of surface shape which provides a meaningful correspondence
across different images, to provide a basis for statistical analysis. Point
locations with anatomical definitions, referred to as landmarks, have been the
traditional approach, with analysis and interpretation which is widely used and
well understood. Landmarks can also be taken as the starting point for more
general surface representations, often using templates which are warped on to
an observed surface by matching landmark positions and subsequent local
adjustment of the surface. The aim of the present paper is to use the
intermediate structures of ridge and valley curves to capture the principal
features of the manifold (surface) of interest. Landmarks are used as anchoring
points, as usual, but curvature information across the surface is used to guide
the curve locations. Once the ridges and valleys have been located, the
intervening surface patches are relatively flat and can be represented in a
standardised manner by appropriate surface transects, to give a complete
surface model. However, the intermediate curve representation is of
considerable interest in its own right, as it captures the principal features
of the surface and therefore embodies much of the shape information on the
object of interest.
  Methods of identifying these curves are described and evaluated. While the
methods are generic, the human face is used as an important application. In
particular, the models are used to investigate sexual dimorphism (the
differences in shape between male and female faces). The curve representation
is shown to capture a major component of the relevant information.

the atmospheric refractive index $n$. At a given altitude, the refractivity
$N=10^6\, (n-1)$ can have relative variations on the order of $10 \%$ depending
on temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Typical corrections to be applied
to $N$ are about $4\%$. Using CoREAS simulations of radio emission from air
showers, we have evaluated the effect of varying $N$ on measurements of the
depth of shower maximum $X_{\rm max}$. For an observation band of 30 to 80 MHz,
a difference of $4 \%$ in refractivity gives rise to a systematic error in the
inferred $X_{\rm max}$ between 3.5 and 11 $\mathrm{g/cm^2}$, for proton showers
with zenith angles ranging from 15 to 50 degrees. At higher frequencies, from
120 to 250 MHz, the offset ranges from 10 to 22 $\mathrm{g/cm^2}$. These
offsets were found to be proportional to the geometric distance to $X_{\rm
max}$. We have compared the results to a simple model based on the Cherenkov
angle. For the 120 to 250 MHz band, the model is in qualitative agreement with
the simulations. In typical circumstances, we find a slight decrease in $X_{\rm

within commonly treated systematic uncertainties, accounting for it explicitly
improves the accuracy of $X_{\rm max}$ measurements.

repaired to maintain system integrity. While typical erasure codes can provide
a significant storage advantage over replication, they suffer from poor repair
efficiency. Locally repairable codes (LRCs) tackle this issue by reducing the
number of nodes participating in the repair process (locality), at the cost of
reduced minimum distance. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between locality
and minimum distance of LRCs with local codes that have arbitrary distance
requirements. Unlike existing methods where both the locality and the local
distance requirements imposed on every node are identical, we allow the
requirements to vary arbitrarily from node to node. Such a property can be an
advantage for distributed storage systems with non-homogeneous characteristics.
We present Singleton-type distance upper bounds and also provide an optimal
code construction with respect to these bounds. In addition, the feasible rate
region is characterized by dimension upper bounds that do not depend on the

system implemented on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) site at Mt. Graham
(Arizona) in forecasting the main atmospheric parameters close to the ground.
The system employs a mesoscale non-hydrostatic numerical model (Meso-Nh). To
validate the model we compare the forecasts of wind speed, wind direction,
temperature and relative humidity close to the ground with the respective
values measured by instrumentation installed on the telescope dome. The study
is performed over a large sample of nights uniformly distributed over two
years. The quantitative analysis is done using classical statistical operators
(bias, RMSE and $\sigma$) and contingency tables, which allows to extract
complementary key information, such as the percentage of correct detection (PC)
and the probability to obtain a correct detection within a defined interval of
values (POD). Results of our study indicate that the model performances in
forecasting the atmospheric parameters we have just cited are very good, in
some cases excellent: RMSE for temperature is below 1{\deg} C, for relative
humidity is 14%, for the wind speed is around 2.5m/s. The relative error of the
RMSE for wind direction varies from 9% to 17% depending on the wind speed
conditions. This work is performed in the context of ALTA (Advanced LBT
Turbulence and Atmosphere) Center project, which final goal is to provide
forecasts of all the atmospheric parameters and the optical turbulence to
support LBT observations, adaptive optics facilities and interferometric

neutron stars. Particular emphasis is put on the possible existence of quark
matter in the cores of rotating neutron stars (pulsars). In contrast to
non-rotating neutron stars, whose particle compositions do not change with time
(are frozen in), the type and structure of the matter in the cores of rotating
neutron stars depends on the spin frequencies of these stars, which opens up a
possible new window on the nature of matter deep in the cores of neutron stars.
Our study shows that, depending on mass and rotational frequency, up to around
8% of the mass of a massive neutron star may be in the mixed quark-hadron
phase, if the phase transition is treated as a Gibbs transition. We also find
that the gravitational mass at which quark deconfinement occurs in rotating
neutron stars varies quadratically with spin frequency, which can be fitted by
a simple formula.

Recent studies that compared lattice QCD predictions of thermodynamic
properties of quark-gluon plasma at freeze-out with calculations based on
statistical hadron resonance gas models as well as experimentally measured
ratios between yields of different hadron species in heavy ion collisions
provide indirect evidence for the presence of ""missing"" resonances in all of

requirements on the expected values and tail probabilities of the differences,
in absolute value and in exponent, between the joint probability of the secret

leakage and variation distance constraints that have been previously considered
in the literature. The capacities under these secrecy criteria are found to be
different when non-vanishing error and secrecy tolerances are allowed. Based on
these new results, we are able to conclude that the strong converse property
generally holds for the DM-WTC only under the two secrecy criteria based on
constraining the tail probabilities. Under the secrecy criteria based on the

a geophysical quantity which can be described using the notions of long-range
persistence and scale invariance/scaling, but this description has suffered
from lack of a generally accepted physical explanation. Processes with these
statistical signatures can arise from non-linear effects, for instance through
cascade-like energy transfer in turbulent fluids, but they can also be produced
by linear models with scale-invariant impulse-response functions. This paper
demonstrates that on time scales from months to centuries, the scale-invariant
impulse-response function of global surface temperature can be explained from
simple linear multi-box energy balance models. This explanation describes both
the scale invariance of the internal variability and the lack of a
characteristic time scale of the response to external forcings. With parameters
estimated from observational data, the climate response is approximately
scaling in these models, even if the response function is not chosen to be
scaling a priori. It is also demonstrated that the differences in scaling
exponents for temperatures over land and for sea-surface temperatures can be
reproduced by a version of the multi-box energy balance model with two distinct
surface boxes.

imaging of nanostructures. The contact stiffness variations have been suggested
as the origin of the image contrast. Therefore, to analyze the image contrast,
the local changes in the contact stiffness due to the presence of subsurface
features should be calculated. So far, only static simulations have been
conducted to analyze the local changes in the contact stiffness and,
consequently, the contrast in US-AFM. Such a static approach does not fully
represent the real US-AFM experiment, where an ultrasound wave is launched
either into the sample or at the tip, which modulates the contact stiffness.
This is a time-dependent nonlinear dynamic problem rather than a static and
stationary one. This letter presents dynamic 3D ultrasound analysis of contact
stiffness in US-AFM (in contrast to static analysis) to realistically predict
the changes in contact stiffness and thus the changes in the subsurface image
contrast. The modulation frequency also influences the contact stiffness
variations and, thus, the image contrast. The three-dimensional time-dependent
ultrasound analysis will greatly aid in the contrast optimization of subsurface
nanoimaging with US-AFM.

pinpoint the regime of magnetization dynamics leading to highest performance.

Boron nitride nanotubes were simply integrated into the colloidal synthesis of
the corresponding nanoparticles. With PbSe, CdSe, and ZnO nanoparticles a wide

mechanisms of all investigated nanoparticles are presented. To emphasize the
new possibilities that boron nitride nanotubes offer as a support material for

composites. In contrast to CdSe nanoparticles attached to carbon nanotubes,
where the fluorescence is quenched, particles attached to boron nitride

this model has been employed to model electrical potential in dendrites and
axons. However, sometimes this equation might give incorrect predictions for
some realistic geometries, in particular when the radius of the cable changes
significantly. Cables with a non constant radius are important for some
phenomena, for example discrete swellings along the axons appear in
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, HIV-associated
dementia and Multiple Sclerosis. In this paper, using the Frenet-Serret frame,
we propose a generalized cable equation for a general cable geometry. This
generalized equation depends on geometric quantities such as the curvature and
torsion of the cable. We show that when the cable has a constant circular
cross-section, the first fundamental form of the cable can be simplified and
the generalized cable equation depends on neither the curvature nor the torsion
of the cable. Additionally, we find an exact solution for an ideal cable which
has a particular variable circular cross-section and zero curvature. For this
case we show that when the cross-section of the cable increases the voltage
decreases. Inspired in this ideal case, we rewrite the generalized cable
equation as a diffusion equation with a source term generated by the cable
geometry. This source term depends on the cable cross-section area and its
derivates. In addition, we study different cables with swelling and provide
their numerical solutions. The numerical solutions show that when the
cross-section of the cable has abrupt changes, its voltage is smaller than the
voltage in the cylindrical cable. Furthermore, these numerical solutions show
that the voltage can be affected by geometrical inhomogeneities on the cable.

research have been pursued to model the interdependency and failure analysis of

the complex interdependencies that might actually exist between the
infrastructures. The \emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} that utilizes
Boolean Logic to capture complex interdependencies was recently proposed which
overcome the limitations of the existing models. A number of problems were
studies based on this model. In this paper we study the \textit{Robustness}
problem in Interdependent Power and Communication Network. The robustness is
defined with respect to two parameters $K \in I^{+} \cup \{0\}$ and $\rho \in
(0,1]$. We utilized the \emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} model to
capture the complex interdependency between the two networks. The model
classifies the interdependency relations into four cases. Computational
complexity of the problem is analyzed for each of these cases. A polynomial
time algorithm is designed for the first case that outputs the optimal
solution. All the other cases are proved to be NP-complete. An
in-approximability bound is provided for the third case. For the general case
we formulate an Integer Linear Program to get the optimal solution and a
