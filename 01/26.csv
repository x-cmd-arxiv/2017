Crab Pulsar. The consensus scenario for the origin of the high-energy pulsed
emission has been challenged with the discovery of a very-high-energy power law
tail extending up to 400 GeV, above the expected spectral cut off at a few GeV.
Now, new measurements obtained by the MAGIC collaboration extend the energy
spectrum of the Crab Pulsar even further, on the TeV regime. Above 400 GeV the
pulsed emission comes mainly from the inter-pulse, which becomes more prominent
with energy due to a harder spectral index. These findings require gamma-ray
production via inverse Compton scattering close to or beyond the light cylinder
radius by an underlying particle population with Lorentz factors greater than 5
times 106. We will present those new results and discuss the implications in
our current knowledge concerning pulsar environments.

equals the number of crossings in any reduced alternating link diagram of the
link. This remarkable result is an application of the Jones polynomial. In the
case of the braid index of an alternating link, Murasugi had conjectured that
the number of Seifert circles in a reduced alternating diagram of the link
equals the braid index of the link. This conjecture turned out to be false. In
this paper we prove the next best thing that one could hope for: we
characterize exactly those alternating links for which their braid indices
equal to the numbers of Seifert circles in their corresponding reduced
alternating link diagrams. More specifically, we prove that if $D$ is a reduced
alternating link diagram of an alternating link $L$, then $b(L)$, the braid
index of $L$, equals the number of Seifert circles in $D$ if and only if
$G_S(D)$ contains no edges of weight one. Here $G_S(D)$, called the Seifert
graph of $D$, is an edge weighted simple graph obtained from $D$ by identifying
each Seifert circle of $D$ as a vertex of $G_S(D)$ such that two vertices in
$G_S(D)$ are connected by an edge if and only if the two corresponding Seifert
circles share crossings between them in $D$ and that the weight of the edge is
the number of crossings between the two Seifert circles. This result is partly
based on the well known MFW inequality, which states that the $a$-span of the
HOMFLY polynomial of $L$ is a lower bound of $2b(L)-2$, as well as a result due
to Yamada, which states that the minimum number of Seifert circles over all
link diagrams of $L$ equals $b(L)$.

the reported numerical and experimental values differ by an order of magnitude.
In this work, we combined numerical and analytical modeling to address this

out ballistic tests on single and double-layered graphene sheets. We used
velocity values within the range tested in experiments. Our numerical and the
experimental results were used to determine parameters for a scaling law, which
is in good agreement with all experimental and simulation results. We find that
the specific penetration energy decreases as the number of layers (N)
increases, from ~25 MJ/kg for N=1 to ~0.26 MJ/kg as N goes to infinity. These
scale effects explain the apparent discrepancy between simulations and

graphene and silicene, have already been realized, others have only been
predicted. An interesting example is the two-dimensional form of silicon
carbide (2D-SiC). Here, we present an observation of atomically thin and
hexagonally bonded nanosized grains of SiC assembling temporarily in graphene
oxide pores during an atomic resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy experiment. Even though these small grains do not fully represent
the bulk crystal, simulations indicate that their electronic structure already
approaches that of 2D-SiC. This is predicted to be flat, but some doubts have
remained regarding the preference of Si for sp$^{3}$ hybridization. Exploring a
number of corrugated morphologies, we find completely flat 2D-SiC to have the
lowest energy. We further compute its phonon dispersion, with a Raman-active
transverse optical mode, and estimate the core level binding energies. Finally,
we study the chemical reactivity of 2D-SiC, suggesting it is like silicene
unstable against molecular absorption or interlayer linking. Nonetheless, it
can form stable van der Waals-bonded bilayers with either graphene or hexagonal
boron nitride, promising to further enrich the family of two-dimensional
materials once bulk synthesis is achieved.

a dataset through the use of graph analytics has been shown to provide
tremendous value in many application domains. However, graphs are not the
primary representation choice for storing most data today, and in order to have
access to these analyses, users are forced to extract data from their data
stores, construct the requisite graphs, and then load them into some graph
engine in order to execute their graph analysis task. Moreover, these graphs
can be significantly larger than the initial input stored in the database,
making it infeasible to construct or analyze such graphs in memory. In this
paper we address both of these challenges by building a system that enables
users to declaratively specify graph extraction tasks over a relational
database schema and then execute graph algorithms on the extracted graphs. We
propose a declarative domain-specific language for this purpose, and pair it up
with a novel condensed, in-memory representation that significantly reduces the
memory footprint of these graphs, permitting analysis of larger-than-memory
graphs. We present a general algorithm for creating this condensed
representation for a large class of graph extraction queries against arbitrary
schemas. We observe that the condensed representation suffers from a
duplication issue, that results in inaccuracies for most graph algorithms. We
then present a suite of in-memory representations that handle this duplication
in different ways and allow trading off the memory required and the
computational cost for executing different graph algorithms. We introduce novel
deduplication algorithms for removing this duplication in the graph, which are
of independent interest for graph compression, and provide a comprehensive
experimental evaluation over several real-world and synthetic datasets
illustrating these trade-offs.

digitization, such as navigation and content generation in virtual

due to its simplicity of acquisition. Traditional image-based 3D reconstruction
approaches heavily exploit point-to-point correspondence among multiple images
to estimate camera motion and 3D geometry. Establishing point-to-point
correspondence lies at the center of the 3D reconstruction pipeline, which
however is easily prone to errors. In this paper, we propose an optimization
framework which traces image points using a novel structure-guided dynamic
tracking algorithm and estimates both the camera motion and a 3D structure
model by enforcing a set of planar constraints. The key to our method is a
structure model represented as a set of planes and their arrangements.
Constraints derived from the structure model is used both in the correspondence
establishment stage and the bundle adjustment stage in our reconstruction
pipeline. Experiments show that our algorithm can effectively localize
structure correspondence across dense image frames while faithfully
reconstructing the camera motion and the underlying structured 3D model.

rigidly in such a way that its approximate virial parameter takes the values of

implications for systems which can be modeled using a Wishart-Laguerre

the smallest eigenvalue of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble plays a crucial role
in characterizing multiple channel telecommunication systems. Similarly, in the
quantum entanglement problem, the smallest eigenvalue of the fixed trace
ensemble carries information regarding the nature of entanglement.
  For real Wishart-Laguerre matrices, there exists an elegant recurrence scheme
suggested by Edelman to directly obtain the exact expression for the smallest
eigenvalue density. In the case of complex Wishart-Laguerre matrices, for
finding exact and explicit expressions for the smallest eigenvalue density,
existing results based on determinants become impractical when the determinants
involve large-size matrices. In this work, we derive a recurrence scheme for
the complex case which is analogous to that of Edelman's for the real case.
This is used to obtain exact results for the smallest eigenvalue density for
both the regular, and the fixed trace complex Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. We
validate our analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. We also study
scaled Wishart-Laguerre ensemble and investigate its efficacy in approximating
the fixed-trace ensemble. Eventually, we apply our result for the fixed-trace

the paramagnons exhibit remarkable robustness to thermal damping and are stable

in events with a Z boson decaying leptonically, accompanied by a bottom or a
top quark decaying hadronically. No excess of events is observed over the
standard model background expectation. Products of production cross section and
branching fraction for T and B quarks from 1.26 and 0.13 pb are excluded at 95%
confidence level for the range of resonance mass considered, which is between
0.7 and 1.7 TeV. Limits on the product of the Z' boson production cross section
and branching fraction, with the Z' boson decaying to the Tt final state, are
set between 0.31 and 0.13 pb, for Z' boson masses in the range from 1.5 to 2.5
TeV. This is the first search at 13 TeV for single production of vector-like
quarks in events with a Z boson decaying leptonically accompanied by boosted
jets.

system numerically is how to develop proper temporal discretization for
nonlinear terms in order to preserve the energy stability at the time-discrete
level. We resolve this issue by developing a set of the first and second order
time marching schemes based on a novel, called ""Invariant Energy
Quadratization"" approach. Its novelty is that the proposed scheme is linear and
symmetric positive definite because all nonlinear terms are treated
semi-explicitly. We further prove all proposed schemes are unconditionally
energy stable rigorously. Various 2D and 3D numerical simulations are presented
to demonstrate the stability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes

model the time between purchases; 2) we train a classifier to predict whether
the user will make a purchase from a new app or continue purchasing from the
existing app; and 3) based on the outcome of the previous step, we attempt to

stress. The approach is used to develop a relationship between the temperature
dependence of the step free energy ($\gamma^\mathrm{st}$) and step excess
quantities for energy and stress that can be readily calculated by atomistic
simulations. We demonstrate the application of this formalism in
thermodynamic-integration (TI) calculations of the step free energy, based on
molecular-dynamics simulations, considering $\left< 110 \right>$ steps on the
$\{111\}$ surface of a classical potential model for elemental Cu. In this
application we employ the Frenkel-Ladd approach to compute the reference value
of $\gamma^\mathrm{st}$ for the TI calculations. Calculated results for excess
energy and stress show relatively weak temperature dependencies up to a
homologous temperature of approximately 0.6, above which these quantities
increase strongly and the step stress becomes more isotropic. From the
calculated excess quantities we compute $\gamma^\mathrm{st}$ over the
temperature range from zero up to the melting point ($T_\mathrm{m}$). We find
that $\gamma^\mathrm{st}$ remains finite up to $T_\mathrm{m}$, indicating the
absence of a roughening temperature for this $\{111\}$ surface facet, but
decreases by roughly fifty percent from the zero-temperature value. The
strongest temperature dependence occurs above homologous temperatures of
approximately 0.6, where the step becomes configurationally disordered due to
the formation of point defects and appreciable capillary fluctuations.

Instead of $l_2$-norm or Mean Square Error (MSE), a new perceptual quality
measure is used as the similarity criterion between the original and the
reconstructed images. The proposed criterion called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM)
index is a modified version of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, which
despite its predecessor, is convex and uni-modal. We derive mathematical
properties for the proposed index and show how to optimally choose the

recovery method based on a constrained $l_1$-norm minimization problem,
incorporating CSIM as the fidelity criterion. The resulting convex optimization
problem is solved via an algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). Taking advantage of the convexity of the CSIM index, we
also prove the convergence of the algorithm to the globally optimal solution of
the proposed optimization problem, starting from any arbitrary point.

In addition to generating completely reproducible integrations, we show that
our framework also offers novel and innovative ways to analyze these

System spanning 10Gyrs, requiring several weeks to run on a modern CPU. In our
framework we can not only easily access simulation data at predefined intervals

this by integrating an on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time from
the nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract arbitrary quantities at any

A drawback of the model is that the PT symmetry of the Hamiltonian is

on characterizing the number count distribution of interloper sources, that is
galaxies with colors similar to those of LBGs, but showing detection at
wavelengths shorter than the spectral break. Without sufficient sensitivity at
bluer wavelengths, a subset of interlopers may not be properly classified, and
contaminate the LBG selection. The surface density of interlopers in the sky
gets steeper with increasing redshift of LBG selections. Since the intrinsic
number of dropouts decreases significantly with increasing redshift, this
implies increasing contamination from misclassified interlopers with increasing
redshift, primarily by intermediate redshift sources with unremarkable
properties (intermediate ages, lack of ongoing star formation and low/moderate
dust content). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the CANDELS deep
data have contamination induced by photometric scatter increasing from ~2% at
z~5 to ~6% at z~8 for a typical dropout color >1 mag, with contamination
naturally decreasing for a more stringent dropout selection. Contaminants are
expected to be located preferentially near the detection limit of surveys,
ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 contaminants per arcmin2 at J=30, depending on the
field considered. This analysis suggests that the impact of contamination in
future studies of z>10 galaxies needs to be carefully considered.

astrophysical problems including the epoch of reionization. Massive short-lived
Wolf-Rayet stars are generally considered as the main ionizing sources. We
examine the role of less massive stars that lose their envelope through
interaction with a companion. We use the evolutionary code MESA and the
radiative transfer code CMFGEN to investigate stripped stars as a function of
metallicity (Z).
  We show that typical progenitors, initially 12$M_{\odot}$, produce hot and
compact stars (~4$M_{\odot}$, 60-80 kK, ~1$R_{\odot}$) that copiously produce
ionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and 30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI
ionizing radiation, for Z=0.0001-0.02. This is comparable to a typical massive
Wolf-Rayet star, when accounting for their longer lifetimes and the favoring
initial mass function. Stripped stars further emit their ionizing photons with
a delay (~20Myrs after star formation for this progenitor), allowing time for
stellar feedback to disperse the birth clouds. This increases the fraction that
can escape and contribute to ionization of the intergalactic medium.
  We further find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich
envelope at low Z. This questions the common treatment of stripped stars in
rapid population synthesis simulations as pure helium stars. We expect
implications for the rate of type Ib/c supernova at low Z and for the advanced
evolutionary channels for type Ia supernova and gravitational wave sources. We
discuss how the characteristic spectral features of stripped stars can be used
to increase the observed sample, which is urgently needed to test the models.

populations, a tight isotropic distribution of B stars around SgrA* (the

of Sverre Aarseth's direct summation code NBODY6 we explore the scenario in
which a young star cluster migrates to the Galactic Centre within the lifetime
of the OB disk population via dynamical friction. We find that star clusters
massive and dense enough to reach the central parsec form a very massive star
via physical collisions on a mass segregation timescale. We follow the
evolution of the merger product using the most up to date, yet conservative,
mass loss recipes for very massive stars. Over a large range of initial
conditions, we find that the very massive star expels most of its mass via a
strong stellar wind, eventually collapsing to form a black hole of mass 20 -
400 M_Sun, incapable of bringing massive stars to the Galactic Centre. No
massive intermediate mass black hole can form in this scenario. The presence of
a star cluster in the central ~10 pc within the last 15 Myr would also leave a
~2 pc ring of massive stars, which is not currently observed. Thus, we conclude
that the star cluster migration model is highly unlikely to be the origin of
either young population, and in-situ formation models or binary disruptions are
favoured.

central role in solving the decades-old cooling flow problem, but one major
problem remains unsolved - how is the AGN energy thermalized in the ICM and
what are the effective black hole feeding rates in realistic systems? We
perform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core
cluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via
collimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via
streaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming
instability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient
needed for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the
physical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression
of CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,
which leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into
contact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally
stable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the
central AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that
CR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic
processes. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure
support in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate
observational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR
energy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level
that is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR
heating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,
and likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in
determining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres.

provides an inroad toward probing the interior of astrophysical BHs. The
general-relativistic description of the BH interior is that of empty spacetime
with a (possibly) singular core. Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH
interior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for
resolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for
answering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does
it contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is
premised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact
stars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should
support fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In
particular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly
insensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal
feature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of
these modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The
r-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce
weaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a
model-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum
resulting from a BH merger. We find that future GW detectors, such as Advanced
LIGO with its design sensitivity, have the potential of detecting such r-modes
if the amount of GWs leaking out quantum mechanically from the interior of a
BH-like object is sufficiently large.

on a similar scaling between stellar mass and specific angular momentum as
local spirals with j*=J/M*\propto M^(2/3) but with a redshift evolution that
scales as j*\propto M^{2/3}(1+z)^(-1). We identify a correlation between
specific angular momentum and disk stability such that galaxies with the
highest specific angular momentum, log(j*/M^(2/3))>2.5, are the most stable,
with Toomre Q=1.10+/-0.18, compared to Q=0.53+/-0.22 for galaxies with

low specific angular momentum are morphologically complex and dominated by
several bright star-forming regions. This suggests that angular momentum plays
a major role in defining the stability of gas disks: at z~1, massive galaxies

unstable, clumpy and turbulent systems. In contrast, galaxies with high
specific angular have evolved in to stable disks with spiral structures.

Type Ibc and Type II supernovae. X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars
and stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star
evolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the
evolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the
distributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of
their companion stars. These three observational features provide unique
information on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within
interacting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5
Msun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of
the supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics
may be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries
(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting
values close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to
be limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet
phase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries
suggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which
could be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the
formation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that
large escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.
Finally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray
binaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess
large peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged)

to achieve the required damping performance and in case of actuator failures
(e.g., due to loss of communication or scheduling), capabilities of the
remaining actuators are fully used before the nominal performance is degraded.
This method offers the advantages of modular design where WADC is initially
designed to achieve satisfactory damping without the detailed knowledge of
actuators. In the next step, CA is designed to manage actuator failures and
limitations without the need to redesign the nominal WADC. The proposed
approach is applied to a modified $286$-bus Western Electricity Coordinating
Council (WECC) system to verify the feasibility on a complex power system.
Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
coordinating multiple actuators and building resiliency.

estimate a 95% confidence upper limit on the FRB rate of $3.6\times 10^3$ FRBs
sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux density of 0.63 Jy at 350 MHz for an
intrinsic pulse width of 5 ms. We place constraints on the spectral index
$\alpha$ by running simulations for different astrophysical scenarios and
cumulative flux density distributions. The non-detection with GBNCC is
consistent with the 1.4-GHz rate reported for the Parkes surveys for $\alpha >
+0.35 $ in the absence of scattering and free-free absorption and $\alpha >
-0.3$ in the presence of scattering, for a Euclidean flux distribution. The
constraints imply that FRBs exhibit either a flat spectrum or a spectral
turnover at frequencies above 400 MHz. These constraints also allow estimation
of the number of bursts that can be detected with current and upcoming surveys.
We predict that CHIME may detect anywhere from several to $\sim$50 FRBs a day
(depending on model assumptions), making it well suited for interesting
constraints on spectral index, the log $N$-log $S$ slope and pulse profile
evolution across its bandwidth (400-800 MHz).

small as $\sim20~{\rm pc}$ in half-light radius and $\sim3~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in
line-of-sight velocity dispersion. In these galaxies, dynamical friction on a
star against dark matter can be significant and alter their stellar density
distribution. The effect can strongly depend on a central density profile of
dark matter, i.e. cusp or core. In this study, I perform computations using a
classical and a modern analytic formulae and $N$-body simulations to study how
dynamical friction changes a stellar density profile and how different it is
between cuspy and cored dark matter haloes. This study shows that, if a dark
matter halo has a cusp, dynamical friction can cause shrivelling instability
which results in emergence of a stellar cusp in the central region
$\simeq2~{\rm pc}$. On the other hand, if it has a constant-density core,
dynamical friction is significantly weaker and does not generate a stellar cusp
even if the galaxy has the same line-of-sight velocity dispersion. In such a
compact and low-mass galaxy, since the shrivelling instability by dynamical
friction is inevitable if it has a dark matter cusp, absence of a stellar cusp
implies that the galaxy has a dark-matter core. I expect that this could be
used to diagnose a dark matter density profile in these compact ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies.

discovered at CERN is unlikely to be a pure radion state, since its decays
resemble those of the Standard Model Higgs boson too closely. However, due to
experimental errors in the measured decay widths, the possibility still remains
that it could be a mixture of the radion with one (or more) Higgs states. We
use the existing LHC data at 8 and 13 TeV to make a thorough investigation of
this possibility. Not surprisingly, it turns out that this model is already
constrained quite effectively by direct LHC searches for an additional scalar
heavier than 125 GeV. We then make a detailed study of the so-called 'conformal

Standard Model fields. Some projections for the future are also included.

Second, we have constructed a data structure capable of efficiently handling
and caching all of the data Tetris needs to work on over the course of the

value of constants $c_\epsilon$ and $\ell$ are a function of the desired error
floor $\epsilon$ and constant $c_1=\frac{\ell}{c_\epsilon}$ (observed to be
approximately equal to 1 for various values of $\epsilon$). More importantly
the iterative decoding algorithm has a sub-linear computational complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(K\log \frac{N}{K})$ which is known to be optimal. Also for $m=c_2

results validate the theoretical results by showing a substantial improvement
in the number of tests required when compared to the testing scheme based on

the riot activity did travel. Access to daily national police data has allowed
us to explore the dynamics of riot propagation. Here we show that an
epidemic-like model, with just a few parameters and a single sociological

the full spatio-temporal dynamics of the riots. This is the first time that
such data-driven modelling involving contagion both within and between cities

geographic proximity played a major role in the propagation, even though

that our approach gives a general framework for the modelling of the dynamics

(EE) subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints in terms of exchange
throughput requirements. The QoS constraints are nonconvex with many nonlinear
cross-terms, so finding a feasible point is already computationally
challenging. The sum throughput appears in the numerator while the total
consumption power appears in the denominator of the EE objective function. The
former is a nonconcave function and the latter is a nonconvex function, making
fractional programming useless for EE optimization. Nevertheless, efficient

static tunneling phase disorder to a one-dimensional lattice, we observe
ballistic quantum spreading as in the case of uniform tunneling. When the
applied disorder fluctuates on timescales comparable to intersite tunneling, we
instead observe diffusive atomic transport, signaling a crossover from quantum

static site-energy disorder, where we directly observe quantum localization in

changes during the anneal. We show that this geometric effect leads to the
appearance of non-stoquastic terms in the effective quantum Ising Hamiltonians
that are typically used to describe QA with flux-qubits. We explicitly
demonstrate the effect of these geometric interactions when QA is performed
with a system of one and two coupled flux-qubits. The realization of
non-stoquastic Hamiltonians has important implications from a computational
complexity perspective, since it is believed that in many cases QA with
stoquastic Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated via classical algorithms
such as Quantum Monte Carlo. It is well-known that the direct implementation of
non-stoquastic interactions with flux-qubits is particularly challenging. Our
results suggest an alternative path for the implementation of non-stoquastic

high-dimensional traits, inferring all pair-wise correlations within the
multivariate diffusion is limiting. To circumvent this problem, we propose
phylogenetic factor analysis (PFA) that assumes a small unknown number of
independent evolutionary factors arise along the phylogeny and these factors
generate clusters of dependent traits. Set in a Bayesian framework, PFA
provides measures of uncertainty on the factor number and groupings, combines
both continuous and discrete traits, integrates over missing measurements and
incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty with the help of molecular sequences. We
develop Gibbs samplers based on dynamic programming to estimate the PFA
posterior distribution, over three-fold faster than for multivariate diffusion
and a further order-of-magnitude more efficiently in the presence of latent
traits. We further propose a novel marginal likelihood estimator for previously
impractical models with discrete data and find that PFA also provides a better
fit than multivariate diffusion in evolutionary questions in columbine flower
development, placental reproduction transitions and triggerfish fin

broadly used in all modern internet-scale systems. However, the design of a DSS

to overcome failure of servers, to correct errors, etc. Lots of research was
done in the last few years to answer these challenges and the research is
increasing in parallel to the increasing amount of stored data.
  The main goal of this paper is to consider codes which have two of the most
important features of distributed storage systems, namely, locality and
availability. Our codes are array codes which are based on subspaces of a
linear space over a finite field. We present several constructions of such
codes which are $q$-analog to some of the known block codes. Some of these
codes possess independent intellectual merit. We examine the locality and

types of locality and availability, node vs.~symbol, locality and availability.
To our knowledge this is the first time that such a distinction is given in the

effect caused by CO2 clouds is only obtained in a rather limited parameter
range which also strongly depends on the stellar effective temperature. For
cool M-stars, CO2 clouds only provide about 6 K of additional greenhouse
heating in the best case scenario. On the other hand, the surface temperature
for a planet around an F-type star can be increased by 30 K if carbon dioxide
clouds are present. Accordingly, the extension of the habitable zone due to

the worst eavesdropper channel is shown to be isotropic around its mean

over the class of uncertainty. Moreover, capacity achieving beamforming
direction is found to require matrix inversion, thus, we derive the null
steering (NS) beamforming as an alternative suboptimal solution that does not
require matrix inversion. NS beamformer is in the direction orthogonal to the
eavesdropper mean channel that maintains the maximum possible gain in mean main
channel direction. Extensive computer simulation reveals that NS performs very
close to the optimal solution. It also verifies that, NS beamforming
outperforms both maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero forcing (ZF)

quantum or classical. A precise estimation of the former can often provide
valuable understanding of the physics of the phase generating phenomena itself.
We theoretically examine the performance of fixed-particle number probe states
in the simultaneous estimation of phase and collective phase diffusion. We
derive analytical quantum limits associated with the simultaneous local
estimation of phase and phase diffusion within the quantum Cramer-Rao bound
framework in the regimes of large and small phase diffusive noise. The former
is for a general fixed-particle number state and the latter for Holland Burnett
states, for which we show quantum-enhanced estimation of phase as well as phase
diffusion. We next investigate the simultaneous attainability of these quantum
limits using projective measurements acting on a single copy of the state in
terms of a trade-off relation. In particular, we are interested how this
trade-off varies as a function of the dimension of the state. We derive an
analytical bound for this trade-off in the large phase diffusion regime for a
particular form of the measurement, and show that the maximum of 2, set by the
quantum Cramer-Rao bound, is attainable. Further, we show numerical evidence
that as diffusion approaches zero, the optimal trade-off relation approaches 1
for Holland-Burnett states. These numerical results are valid in the small
particle number regime and suggest that the trade-off for estimating one
parameter with quantum-limited precision leads to a complete lack of precision
for the other parameter as the diffusion strength approaches zero. Finally, we
provide numerical results showing behaviour of the trade-off for a general
value of phase diffusion when using Holland-Burnett probe states.

in the two limits as p goes to 0 and as p goes to 1. We identify new schemes

interference cancellation at low values of p. Our schemes are based on an
algorithm that achieves the optimal DoF value in any network realization, when

stellar mass. Overall, the ex situ fraction slowly increases in central
galaxies with increasing halo mass but sharply increases for $\log

which implies that mergers are essential to build stellar masses above $\log

of mass growth channels. Mergers become the primary channel in the mass growth
of central galaxies when their host halo mass begins to exceed $\log

on maps with a common co-domain. This operation is commutative, associative,
and the unique map from the empty type into the common codomain is a neutral
element. Moreover, we show that the idempotents of the join of maps are
precisely the embeddings, and we prove the `join connectivity theorem', which
states that the connectivity of the join of maps equals the join of the
connectivities of the individual maps.
  We define the image of a map $f:A\to X$ in $U$ via the join construction, as
the colimit of the finite join powers of $f$. The join powers therefore provide
approximations of the image inclusion, and the join connectivity theorem
implies that the approximating maps into the image increase in connectivity.
  A modified version of the join construction can be used to show that for any
map $f:A\to X$ in which $X$ is only assumed to be locally small, the image is a
small type. We use the modified join construction to give an alternative
construction of set-quotients, the Rezk completion of a precategory, and we
define the $n$-truncation for any $n:\mathbb{N}$. Thus we see that each of
these are definable operations on a univalent universe for Martin-L\""of type
theory with a natural numbers object, that is moreover closed under homotopy

One compelling alternative is to perform In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) by
extracting fuel from small bodies in local space such as asteroids or small
satellites. Compared to the Moon or Mars, the microgravity on an asteroid
demands a fraction of the energy for digging and accessing hydrated regolith
just below the surface. Previous asteroid excavation efforts have focused on
discrete capture events (an extension of sampling technology) or whole-asteroid
capture and processing. This paper proposes an optimized bucket wheel design
for surface excavation of an asteroid or small-body. Asteroid regolith is
excavated and water extracted for use as rocket propellant. Our initial study
focuses on system design, bucket wheel mechanisms, and capture dynamics applied
to ponded materials known to exist on asteroids like Itokawa and Eros and small
satellites like Phobos and Deimos. For initial evaluation of
material-spacecraft dynamics and mechanics, we assume lunar-like regolith for
bulk density, particle size and cohesion. We shall present our estimates for
the energy balance of excavation and processing versus fuel gained.
Conventional electrolysis of water is used to produce hydrogen and oxygen. It
is compared with steam for propulsion and both show significant delta-v. We
show that a return trip from Deimos to Earth is possible for a 12 kg craft
using ISRU processed fuel.

a uv-coordinates naturally represented by a complex number. We show that
natural, efficient robot paths can be obtained by using such coordinate

Use of reaction wheels enables these robots to roll, hop, summersault and rest
on precarious/sloped surfaces that would otherwise not be possible with
conven-tional wheeled robots. We are extending this technology to enable robots
to climb off-world canyons, cliffs and caves. A single robot may slip and fall,
however, a multirobot system can work cooperatively by being interlinked using
spring-tethers and work much like a team of mountaineers to systematically
climb a slope. A multirobot system as we will show in this paper can climb
sur-faces not possible with a single robot alone. We consider a team of four
robots that are interlinked with tethers in an 'x' configuration. Each robot
secures itself to a slope using spiny gripping actuators, and one by one each
robot moves up-wards by crawling, rolling or hopping up the slope. If any one
of the robots loses grip, slips or falls, the remaining robots will be holding
it up as they are anchored. This distributed controls approach to cliff
climbing enables the system to reconfigure itself where possible and avoid
getting stuck at one hard to reach location. Instead, the risk is distributed
and through close cooperation, the robots can identify multiple trajectories to
climb a cliff or rugged surface. The benefits can also be realized on
milligravity surfaces such as asteroids. Too fast a jump can result in the
robot flying off the surface into space. Having multiple robots anchored to the
surface keeps the entire system secure. Our work combines dynamics and control
simulation to evaluate the feasibility of our approach. The simulation results
show a promising pathway towards advanced development of this technology on a

playing at home in one leg and the final outcome decided on aggregate, are
common. Many players, managers and followers seem to believe in the `second-leg
home advantage', i.e. that it is beneficial to play at home on the second leg.
A more complex effect than the usual and well-established home advantage, it is
harder to identify, and previous statistical studies did not prove conclusive
about its actuality. Yet, given the amount of money handled in international
football competitions nowadays, the question of existence or otherwise of this
effect is of real import. As opposed to previous research, this paper addresses
it from a purely nonparametric perspective and brings a very objective answer,
not based on any particular model specification which could orientate the
analysis in one or the other direction. Along the way, the paper reviews the
well-known shortcomings of the Wald confidence interval for a proportion,
suggests new nonparametric confidence intervals for conditional probability
functions, revisits the problem of the bias when building confidence intervals
in nonparametric regression, and provides a novel bootstrap-based solution to
it. Finally, the new intervals are used in a careful analysis of game outcome

disagreement with the expected critical behavior with dynamical exponent z = 3.
We show that finite size effects are particularly strong for z = 3 criticality
and give rise to a behavior different from that of an infinite system, over a
wide range of momenta and frequencies. We argue that by taking finite size
effects into account, the QMC results can be explained within z = 3 theory. Our
results also have implications for small interacting fermionic systems, such as
magnetic nanoparticles.

quench by applying the time-dependent numerical renormalization group (TDNRG)
approach to the Anderson impurity model in the strong correlation limit. For
this purpose, we derive within TDNRG a numerically tractable expression for the
retarded two-time nonequilibrium Green function $G(t+t',t)$, and its associated
time-dependent spectral function, $A(\omega,t)$, for times $t$ both before and
after the quench. Quenches from both mixed valence and Kondo correlated initial
states to Kondo correlated final states are considered. For both cases, we find
that the Kondo resonance in the zero temperature spectral function, a preformed
version of which is evident at very short times $t\to 0^{+}$, only fully
develops at very long times $t\gtrsim 1/T_{\rm K}$, where $T_{\rm K}$ is the
Kondo temperature of the final state. In contrast, the final state satellite
peaks develop on a fast time scale $1/\Gamma$ during the time interval
$-1/\Gamma \lesssim t \lesssim +1/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization
strength. Initial and final state spectral functions are recovered in the
limits $t\rightarrow -\infty$ and $t\rightarrow +\infty$, respectively. Our
formulation of two-time nonequilibrium Green functions within TDNRG provides a
first step towards using this method as an impurity solver within
nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory.

piezoelectric actuators. This paper presents Shape memory alloys (SMA)

individual actuator is imprecise due to hysteresis and temperature variation.
The system as a whole achieves reliable results. The SMAs can be programmed to

control system for CubeSat telescopes is very challenging because current
choice of actuators such as reaction-wheels and magnetorquers can induce jitter
on the spacecraft due to moving mechanical parts and due to external
disturbances. These telescopes may contain cryo-pumps and servos that introduce
additional vibrations. A better solution is required. In our paper, we analyze
the feasibility of utilizing solar radiation pressure (SRP) and radiometric
force to achieve precise attitude control. Our studies show radiometric
actuators to be a viable method to achieve precise pointing. The device uses 8
thin vanes of different temperatures placed in a near-vacuum chamber. These
chambers contain trace quantities of lightweight, inert gasses like argon. The
temperature gradient across the vanes causes the gas molecules to strike the
vanes differently and thus inducing a force. By controlling these forces, it's
possible to produce a torque to precisely point or spin a spacecraft. We
present a conceptual design of a CubeSat that is equipped with these actuators.
We then analyze the potential slew maneuver and slew rates possible with these
actuators by simulating their performance. Our analytical and simulation
results point towards a promising pathway for laboratory testing of this

singular value decomposition and QR pivoting, which are two ubiquitous matrix
computations that underpin modern linear dimensionality reduction. Sparse
sensing in a tailored basis is contrasted with compressed sensing, a universal
signal recovery method in which an unknown signal is reconstructed via a sparse
representation in a universal basis. Although compressed sensing can recover a
wider class of signals, we demonstrate the benefits of exploiting known
patterns in data with optimized sensing. In particular, drastic reductions in
the required number of sensors and improved reconstruction are observed in
examples ranging from facial images to fluid vorticity fields. Principled
sensor placement may be critically enabling when sensors are costly and
provides faster state estimation for low-latency, high-bandwidth control.

linear dispersion along one symmetry direction but anisotropic non-linear
dispersion along the two transverse directions with a topological charge larger
than one. Using the Boltzmann transport theory and fully incorporating the
anisotropy of the system, we study the DC conductivity as a function of carrier

temperature dependence of the transport coefficients at the level of Boltzmann
theory are controlled by the topological charge of the multi-Weyl point and
distinguish m-WSMs from their linear Weyl counterparts.

of the stress-energy tensor. We use general properties of correlation functions
and the gravitational Ward identity to parametrize analytical structures of the
Green functions describing both sound and diffusion mode. We find that the
hydrodynamic limits of the real parts of the respective energy-momentum tensor
correlation functions provide us with the method of computing both the shear

relaxation time using the diagrammatic approach in the Keldysh basis for the
massless $\lambda\phi^4$ theory. We derive a respective integral equation which
enables us to compute $\eta\tau_\pi$ and then we extract the shear relaxation
time. The relaxation time is shown to be inversely related to the thermal width

time-dependent Hamiltonian finally reach a steady state? This question has only
recently been answered for driving protocols that are periodic in time, where
the long time behavior of the local properties synchronize with the drive and
can be described by an appropriate periodic ensemble. Here, we explore the
consequences of breaking the time-periodic structure of the drive with
additional aperiodic noise in a class of integrable systems. We show that the
resulting unitary dynamics leads to new emergent steady states in at least two
cases. While any typical realization of random noise causes eventual heating to
an infinite temperature ensemble for all local properties in spite of the
system being integrable, noise which is self-similar in time leads to an
entirely different steady state, which we dub as ""geometric generalized Gibbs
ensemble"", that emerges only after an astronomically large time scale. To
understand the approach to steady state, we study the temporal behavior of
certain coarse-grained quantities in momentum space that fully determine the
reduced density matrix for a subsystem with size much smaller than the total
system. Such quantities provide a concise description for any drive protocol in
integrable systems that are reducible to a free fermion representation.

by data values, and by the algebraic operations and equations capturing some
computational effects. These algebras are free in the sense that they satisfy
just the equations imposed by their algebraic theory, and remain free of any
additional equations. The consequence is that they do not admit quotient types.
This is, of course, often inconvenient. Whenever a computation involves data
with multiple representatives, and they need to be identified according to some
equations that are not satisfied by all data, the monadic programmer has to
leave the universe of free algebras, and resort to explicit destructors. We
characterize the situation when these destructors are preserved under all
operations, and the resulting quotients of free algebras are also their
subalgebras. Such quotients are called *projective*. Although popular in
universal algebra, projective algebras did not attract much attention in the
monadic setting, where they turn out to have a surprising avatar: for any given
monad, a suitable category of projective algebras is equivalent with the
category of coalgebras for the comonad induced by any monad resolution. For a
monadic programmer, this equivalence provides a convenient way to implement
polymorphic quotients as coalgebras. The dual correspondence of injective
coalgebras and all algebras leads to a different family of quotient types,
which seems to have a different family of applications. Both equivalences also
entail several general corollaries concerning monadicity and comonadicity.

work values needed to reach a given accuracy of $\Delta F$ is determined by the
variance of $e^{-\beta W}$, denoted ${\rm var}(e^{-\beta W})$. We discover in
this work that ${\rm var}(e^{-\beta W})$ in both harmonic and an-harmonic
Hamiltonian systems can systematically diverge in non-adiabatic work protocols,
even when the adiabatic protocols do not suffer from such divergence. This
divergence may be regarded as a type of dynamically induced phase transition in
work fluctuations. For a quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent
trapping frequency as a working example, any non-adiabatic work protocol is
found to yield a diverging ${\rm var}(e^{-\beta W})$ at sufficiently low
temperatures, markedly different from the classical behavior. The divergence of
${\rm var}(e^{-\beta W})$ indicates the too-far-from-equilibrium nature of a
non-adiabatic work protocol and makes it compulsory to apply designed control

discovered recently in 2015. Similar to normal (type-I) Weyl semimetals,
type-II Weyl semimetals consist of isolated band touching points. However,
unlike type-I Weyl semimetals which have a linear energy dispersion around the
band touching points forming a three dimensional (3D) Dirac cone, type-II Weyl
semimetals have a tilted cone-like structure around the band touching points.
This leads to various novel physical properties that are different from type-I
Weyl semimetals. In order to study further the properties of type-II Weyl
semimetals and perhaps realize them for future applications, generating
controllable type-II Weyl semimetals is desirable. In this paper, we propose a
way to generate a type-II Weyl semimetal via a generalized Harper model
interacting with a harmonic driving field. When the field is treated
classically, we find that only type-I Weyl points emerge. However, by treating
the field quantum mechanically, some of these type-I Weyl points may turn into
type-II Weyl points. Moreover, by tuning the coupling strength, it is possible
to control the tilt of the Weyl points and the energy difference between two
Weyl points, which makes it possible to generate a pair of mixed Weyl points of
type-I and type-II. We also discuss how to physically distinguish these two
types of Weyl points in the framework of our model via the Landau level
structures in the presence of an artificial magnetic field. The results are of
general interest to quantum optics as well as ongoing studies of Floquet

  Games",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Congestion games constitute an important class of non-cooperative games which
was introduced by Rosenthal in 1973. In recent years, several extensions of
these games were proposed to incorporate aspects that are not captured by the
standard model. Examples of such extensions include the incorporation of risk
sensitive players, the modeling of altruistic player behavior and the
imposition of taxes on the resources. These extensions were studied intensively
with the goal to obtain a precise understanding of the inefficiency of
equilibria of these games. In this paper, we introduce a new model of
congestion games that captures these extensions (and additional ones) in a
unifying way. The key idea here is to parameterize both the perceived cost of
each player and the social cost function of the system designer. Intuitively,
each player perceives the load induced by the other players by an extent of
{\rho}, while the system designer estimates that each player perceives the load
of all others by an extent of {\sigma}. The above mentioned extensions reduce
to special cases of our model by choosing the parameters {\rho} and {\sigma}
accordingly. As in most related works, we concentrate on congestion games with
affine latency functions here. Despite the fact that we deal with a more
general class of congestion games, we manage to derive tight bounds on the
price of anarchy and the price of stability for a large range of pa- rameters.
Our bounds provide a complete picture of the inefficiency of equilibria for
these perception-parameterized congestion games. As a result, we obtain tight
bounds on the price of anarchy and the price of stability for the above
mentioned extensions. Our results also reveal how one should ""design"" the cost
functions of the players in order to reduce the price of anar- chy.

The present paper builds on [13] by introducing an index of efficiency of a

of the solution (called bridge) - an iterated bridge invariance property and
the invariance of the most probable paths. These properties, which were
tangentially mentioned in our previous work, are fully developed here. We also
show that the distribution on paths of the optimal transport policy, which

temperature goes to zero. The relevance of all of these properties for
transport over networks is illustrated in an example.

in opposite directions. The analysis of the stellar populations of the
counter-rotating components provides constraints on the environmental and
internal processes that drive their formation.
  Aims. The S0 NGC 1366 in the Fornax cluster is known to host a stellar
component that is kinematically decoupled from the main body of the galaxy.
Here we successfully separated the two counter-rotating stellar components to
independently measure the kinematics and properties of their stellar
populations.
  Methods. We performed a spectroscopic decomposition of the spectrum obtained
along the galaxy major axis and separated the relative contribution of the two
counter-rotating stellar components and of the ionized-gas component. We
measured the line-strength indices of the two counter-rotating stellar
components and modeled each of them with single stellar population models that
account for the {\alpha}/Fe overabundance.
  Results. We found that the counter-rotating stellar component is younger, has
nearly the same metallicity, and is less {\alpha}/Fe enhanced than the
corotating component. Unlike most of the counter-rotating galaxies, the ionized
gas detected in NGC 1366 is neither associated with the counter-rotating
stellar component nor with the main galaxy body. On the contrary, it has a
disordered distribution and a disturbed kinematics with multiple velocity
components observed along the minor axis of the galaxy.
  Conclusions. The different properties of the counter-rotating stellar
components and the kinematic peculiarities of the ionized gas suggest that NGC
1366 is at an intermediate stage of the acquisition process, building the
counter-rotating components with some gas clouds still falling onto the galaxy.

has a very high gas content compared to galaxies of similar stellar mass, with
a HI to stellar mass ratio M_HI/M_* ~90, typical of almost-dark dwarfs.

show using only probablistic tools that there is convergence in $L^2$ of the
empirical measure (normalized by the mean number of particles) if and only if
an associated additive martingale is bounded in $L^2$. This is a significant
improvement over previous results, which were mainly restricted to
$\lambda$-positive motions. We then investigate under which conditions this
limit is strictly positive on the event of non-extinction and show that this
occurs whenever, on the latter event, particles do not accumulate on the
boundary of the state space. In particular, this property also yields the
convergence of the real empirical measure (normalized by the number of
particles). Moreover, building on previous results we prove that if the motion
is $\lambda$-positive then these limits hold also almost surely whenever the
Doob's $h$-transform of this motion admits a suitable Lyapunov functional.
Finally, we illustrate our results for a variety of different motions: ergodic
motions without absorption, $\lambda$-positive systems either transient or with
absorption, and also certain non $\lambda$-positive systems such as the
Brownian motion with negative drift killed at $0$. A strong law of large
numbers for the empirical measure in this last example was announced by Kesten

bulges on environment for a flux limited sample of $\sim$5000 SDSS galaxies. We
have separated bulges into classical and pseudo bulge categories based on their
position on the Kormendy diagram. Pseudo bulges are thought to be formed by
internal processes and are a result of secular evolution in galaxies. We
attempt to understand the dependence of secular evolution on environment and
morphology. Dividing our sample of disc+bulge galaxies based on group
membership into three categories: central and satellite galaxies in groups and
isolated field galaxies, we find that pseudo bulge fraction is almost equal for
satellite and field galaxies. Fraction of pseudo bulge hosts in central
galaxies is almost half of the fraction of pseudo bulges in satellite and field
galaxies. This trend is also valid when only galaxies are considered only
spirals or S0. Using the projected fifth nearest neighbour density as measure
of local environment, we look for the dependence of pseudo bulge fraction on
environmental density. Satellite and field galaxies show very weak or no
dependence of pseudo bulge fraction on environment. However, fraction of pseudo
bulges hosted by central galaxies decreases with increase in local
environmental density. We do not find any dependence of pseudo bulge luminosity
on environment. Our results suggest that the processes that differentiate the
bulge types are a function of environment while processes responsible for the
formation of pseudo bulges seem to be independent of environment.

graph theory in which points in time are represented by network nodes, and
similarities in brain states between two different time points are represented
as network edges. We use a graph-based clustering technique to identify
clusters of time points representing canonical brain states, and to assess the
manner in which the brain moves from one state to another as learning
progresses. We observe the presence of two primary states characterized by
either high activation in sensorimotor cortex or high activation in a
frontal-subcortical system. Flexible switching among these primary states and
other less common states becomes more frequent as learning progresses, and is
inversely correlated with individual differences in learning rate. These
results are consistent with the notion that the development of automaticity is
associated with a greater freedom to use cognitive resources for other
processes. Taken together, our work offers new insights into the constrained,
low dimensional nature of brain dynamics characteristic of early learning,
which give way to less constrained, high-dimensional dynamics in later
learning.

Classifying different populations of planets is not only important for our
understanding of the demographics of various planetary types in the galaxy, but
also for our understanding of planet formation. We explore the nature of two
regimes in the planetary mass-radius (M-R) relation. We suggest that the
transition between the two regimes of ""small"" and ""large"" planets, occurs at a
mass of 124 \pm 7, M_Earth and a radius of 12.1 \pm 0.5, R_Earth. Furthermore,
the M-R relation is R \propto M^{0.55\pm 0.02} and R \propto M^{0.01\pm0.02}
for small and large planets, respectively. We suggest that the location of the
breakpoint is linked to the onset of electron degeneracy in hydrogen, and
therefore, to the planetary bulk composition. Specifically, it is the
characteristic minimal mass of a planet which consists of mostly hydrogen and
helium, and therefore its M-R relation is determined by the equation of state
of these materials. We compare the M-R relation from observational data with
the one derived by population synthesis calculations and show that there is a
good qualitative agreement between the two samples.

and a hybrid operational semantics that process separately the causal
mechanisms via Petri nets, and the constraints associated to objects and to
events via Answer Set Programming (ASP). These two alternative specifications
enable an empirical evaluation in terms of computational efficiency.
Experimental results show that the hybrid semantics is more efficient w.r.t.
sequences, whereas the two semantics follows the same behaviour w.r.t.
branchings (although the denotational one performs better in absolute terms).

is parabolically induced by a tensor product of irreducible representations

irreducible representations of p-adic general linear groups by irreducible
representations supported by cuspidal lines. It is obvious that in this
correspondence an irreducible representation of a p-adic general linear group
is unitarizable if and only if all the corresponding irreducible
representations supported by cuspidal lines are unitarizable. C. Jantzen has
defined an analogue of such correspondence for irreducible representations of
classical p-adic groups. It would have interesting consequences if one would
know that the unitarizability is also preserved in this case. A purpose of this
paper and its sequel, is to give some very limited support for possibility of
such preservation of the unitarizability. More precisely, we show that if we
have an irreducible unitarizable representation $\pi$ of a classical p-adic
group whose one attached representation $\pi_L$ supported by a cuspidal line
$L$ has the same infinitesimal character as the generalized Steinberg

uncovering this scenario with the help of longevity of gluinos; if the mass

advances in assisted/autonomous driving technologies are supposed to reduce the

extent, while compromised cars have become a reality, the numerous attacks
reported so far on in-vehicle electronics are exclusively concerned with

a more complex scenario where driving decisions deluded by corrupted

attention on chain collisions involving multiple vehicles that can be amplified
by simple adversarial interventions, e.g., delaying taillights or falsifying
speedometer readings. We provide metrics for assessing adversarial impact and
consider safety margins against adversarial actions. Moreover, we discuss
intelligent adversarial behaviour by which the creation of rogue platoons is
possible and speed manipulations become stealthy to human drivers. We emphasize
that our work does not try to show the mere fact that imprudent speeds and
headways lead to chain-collisions, but points out that an adversary may favour
such scenarios (eventually keeping his actions stealthy for human drivers) and
further asks for quantifying the impact of adversarial activity or whether
existing traffic regulations are prepared for such situations.

that provides quantitative MRI measures using randomized acquisition.
Extraction of physical quantitative tissue parameters is performed off-line,
without the need of patient presence, based on acquisition with varying
parameters and a dictionary generated according to the Bloch equation
simulations. MRF uses hundreds of radio frequency (RF) excitation pulses for
acquisition, and therefore a high undersampling ratio in the sampling domain
(k-space) is required for reasonable scanning time. This undersampling causes
spatial artifacts that hamper the ability to accurately estimate the tissue's
quantitative values. In this work, we introduce a new approach for quantitative
MRI using MRF, called magnetic resonance Fingerprinting with LOw Rank (FLOR).
  Methods: We exploit the low rank property of the concatenated temporal
imaging contrasts, on top of the fact that the MRF signal is sparsely
represented in the generated dictionary domain. We present an iterative scheme
that consists of a gradient step followed by a low rank projection using the
singular value decomposition.
  Results: Experimental results consist of retrospective sampling, that allows
comparison to a well defined reference, and prospective sampling that shows the
performance of FLOR for a real-data sampling scenario. Both experiments
demonstrate improved parameter accuracy compared to other compressed-sensing
and low-rank based methods for MRF at 5% and 9% sampling ratios, for the
retrospective and prospective experiments, respectively.
  Conclusions: We have shown through retrospective and prospective experiments
that by exploiting the low rank nature of the MRF signal, FLOR recovers the MRF
temporal undersampled images and provides more accurate parameter maps compared
to previous iterative methods.

X-ray photons off quantized plasma electrons in the strong magnetic field (of
the order 10^12 G) close to the surface of an accreting X-ray pulsar. The line
profiles of CRSFs cannot be described by an analytic expression. Numerical
methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the scattering processes are
required in order to predict precise line shapes for a given physical setup,
which can be compared to observations to gain information about the underlying
physics in these systems.
  A versatile simulation code is needed for the generation of synthetic
cyclotron lines. Sophisticated geometries should be investigatable by making
their simulation possible for the first time.
  The simulation utilizes the mean free path tables described in the first
paper of this series for the fast interpolation of propagation lengths. The
code is parallelized to make the very time consuming simulations possible on
convenient time scales. Furthermore, it can generate responses to
mono-energetic photon injections, producing Green's functions, which can be
used later to generate spectra for arbitrary continua.
  We develop a new simulation code to generate synthetic cyclotron lines for
complex scenarios, allowing for unprecedented physical interpretation of the
observed data. An associated XSPEC model implementation is used to fit
synthetic line profiles to NuSTAR data of Cep X-4. The code has been developed
with the main goal of overcoming previous geometrical constraints in MC
simulations of CRSFs. By applying this code also to more simple, classic
geometries used in previous works, we furthermore address issues of code
verification and cross-comparison of various models. The XSPEC model and the

have almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations and negligible
primordial gravitational waves. We investigate whether adding another fluid
with $1/3 < \lambda = p/\rho < 1$, which should dominate near the bounce, can
increase the amplitude of gravitational waves in the high frequency regime,
turning them detectable in near future observations for such range of
frequencies. Indeed, we show that the energy density of primordial
gravitational waves is proportional to $k^{2(9\lambda-1)/(1+3\lambda)}$ for
wavelengths which become bigger than the Hubble radius when this extra fluid
dominates the background. Hence, as $\lambda \to 1$ (an almost stiff matter
fluid), the energy density of primordial gravitational waves will increase
faster in frequency, turning them potentially detectable at high frequencies.
However, there is an extra factor $I_q(\lambda)$ in the amplitude which
decreases exponentially with $\lambda$. The net effect of these two
contributions turns the energy density of primordial gravitational waves not
sufficiently big at high frequencies in order to be detected by present day or
near future observations for models which satisfy the nucleosynthesis bounds
and is symmetric with respect to the bounce. Hence, symmetric bouncing models
where the background is dominated by a dust hydrodynamical fluid with small
sound velocity, do not present any significant amount of primordial
gravitational waves at any frequency range compatible with observations, even
if there are other fields present in the model dominating the bounce phase. Any
detection of such waves will then rule out this kind of models.

effect on the surface geology of icy bodies in the Solar System. However the
aqueous environments believed to be present on these bodies are likely to be
saline rather than pure water. Laboratory work to underpin the properties of
clathrates in such environments is lacking. We fill this gap by carrying out a
laboratory investigation of the physical properties of CO$_2$ clathrates
produced in weak aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We use synchrotron X-ray powder
diffraction to investigate clathrates formed at high CO$_2$ pressure in ice
that has formed from aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We measure the thermal
expansion, density and dissociation properties of the clathrates under
temperature conditions similar to those on icy Solar System bodies. We find
that the sulphate solution inhibits the formation of clathrates by lowering
their dissociation temperatures. Hysteresis is found in the thermal expansion
coefficients as clathrates are cooled and heated; we attribute this to the
presence of the salt in solution. The density derived from X-ray powder
diffraction is temperature and pressure dependent. When comparing the density
of CO$_2$ clathrates to that of the solution in which they formed, we conclude
that they sink in the oceans in which they form. We also find that the
polymorph of ice present at low temperatures is Ih rather than Ic, which we
attribute to the presence of the MgSO$_4$. We 1) conclude that the clathrate
density has implications for their behaviour in satellite oceans as their
sinking and floating capabilities are temperature and pressure dependent, 2)
conclude that the presence of MgSO$_4$ inhibits the formation of clathrates and
in some cases may even affect their structure and 3) report the dominance of Ih
throughout the experimental procedure despite Ic being the stable phase at low

exploitation of the small but significant differences in the electronic
circuits generated during the production process. Thus, these differences
become an intrinsic property of the electronic components, which can be
detected and become an unique fingerprint of the component and of the mobile
phone. In this paper, we investigate the identification of mobile phones
through their builtin magnetometers, which has not been reported in literature
yet. Magnetometers are stimulated with different waveforms using a solenoid
connected to a computer s audio board. The identification is performed
analyzing the digital output of the magnetometer through the use of statistical
features and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm. We
prove that this technique can distinguish different models and brands with very
high accuracy but it can only distinguish phones of the same model with limited
accuracy.

comparison between HR7355 and a similar analysis for the Ap star CUVir, allows
us to study how the different physical parameters of the two stars affect the
structure of the respective magnetospheres where the non-thermal electrons
originate. Our model includes a cold thermal plasma component that accumulates
at high magnetic latitudes that influences the radio regime, but does not give
rise to X-ray emission. Instead, the thermal X-ray emission arises from shocks
generated by wind stream collisions close to the magnetic equatorial plane. The
analysis of the X-ray spectrum of HR7355 also suggests the presence of a
non-thermal radiation. Comparison between the spectral index of the power-law
X-ray energy distribution with the non-thermal electron energy distribution
indicates that the non-thermal X-ray component could be the auroral signature
of the non-thermal electrons that impact the stellar surface, the same
non-thermal electrons that are responsible for the observed radio emission. On
the basis of our analysis, we suggest a novel model that simultaneously

ranging from earth surveillance to industry automation to the smart grids. An
important type of TS analysis is classification, which can, for instance,
improve energy load forecasting in smart grids by detecting the types of
electronic devices based on their energy consumption profiles recorded by
automatic sensors. Such sensor-driven applications are very often characterized
by (a) very long TS and (b) very large TS datasets needing classification.
However, current methods to time series classification (TSC) cannot cope with
such data volumes at acceptable accuracy; they are either scalable but offer
only inferior classification quality, or they achieve state-of-the-art
classification quality but cannot scale to large data volumes.
  In this paper, we present WEASEL (Word ExtrAction for time SEries
cLassification), a novel TSC method which is both scalable and accurate. Like
other state-of-the-art TSC methods, WEASEL transforms time series into feature
vectors, using a sliding-window approach, which are then analyzed through a
machine learning classifier. The novelty of WEASEL lies in its specific method
for deriving features, resulting in a much smaller yet much more discriminative
feature set. On the popular UCR benchmark of 85 TS datasets, WEASEL is more
accurate than the best current non-ensemble algorithms at orders-of-magnitude
lower classification and training times, and it is almost as accurate as
ensemble classifiers, whose computational complexity makes them inapplicable
even for mid-size datasets. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL is also
confirmed by experiments on two real smart grid datasets, where it
out-of-the-box achieves almost the same accuracy as highly tuned,

gene trees - can be reconstructed from empirically estimated evolutionary
event-relations containing pairs of orthologous, paralogous or xenologous
genes. The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees
are \emph{biologically feasible}, that is, if there is a possible true history
that would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down
to finding a reconciliation map - also known as DTL-scenario - between the
event-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree.
  In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid
reconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees $T$ that contain
speciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown
species tree $S$ in terms of ""informative"" triples that are displayed in $T$
and provide information of the topology of $S$. These informative triples are
used to infer the unknown species tree $S$ for $T$. We obtain a similar result
for non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs
to be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide
whether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the
positive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted)
reconciliation map.
  However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have its limitations
when they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While
reconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is
not true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples do neither
provide enough information to characterize ""relaxed"" DTL-scenarios nor
non-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene
trees.

decoding-error (R < I(Q, P)) and strict correct-decoding (R > I(Q, P)) follow
as special cases of the exponents for source encoding success/failure,
respectively. Moreover, by letting the threshold D take general values, the
exact random-coding exponents for erasure (D > 0) and list decoding (D < 0)
under the simplified Forney decoder are obtained. Finally, we derive the exact
random-coding exponent for Forney's optimum tradeoff erasure/list decoder, and
show that at the erasure regime it coincides with Forney's lower bound and with
the simplified decoder exponent.

often leads to unreliable or inconsistent statements about the data, rendering
practical applications, especially in scientific domains, futile. Therefore, we
here extend the optimistic estimator framework for optimal subgroup discovery
to a new class of objective functions: we show how tight estimators can be
computed efficiently for all functions that are determined by subgroup size
(non-decreasing dependence), the subgroup median value, and a dispersion
measure around the median (non-increasing dependence). In the important special
case when dispersion is measured using the average absolute deviation from the
median, this novel approach yields a linear time algorithm. Empirical
evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows that, when used within
branch-and-bound search, this approach is highly efficient and indeed discovers
subgroups with much smaller errors.

discrete-event abstraction. At this abstraction level, a timed sequence
ofpertinent ""events"" input to a system (or internal, in the case of timeouts)
cause instantaneous changes to the state of the system. Between events, the
state does not change, resulting in a a piecewise constant state trajectory.
Main advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for
modular composition.
  This chapter introduces the Classic DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion,
using a simple traffic light example. The syntax and operational semantics of
Atomic (i.e., non-hierarchical) models are intruced first. The semantics of
Coupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS
models. As this formal ""flattening"" is not efficient, a modular abstract
simulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This
is the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to
actual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance
analysis for queueing systems. Finally, we present some of the shortcomings in
the Classic DEVS formalism, and show solutions to them in the form of variants
of the original formalism.

allele, inherited from the most recent atom of a random point measure
(infinitely-many-allele model) on the skeleton of the tree. The partition of
the boundary into distinct alleles is the so-called allelic partition.
  In this paper, we are interested in the infinite trees generated by
supercritical, possibly time-inhomogeneous, binary branching processes, and in
their boundary, which is the set of particles `co-existing at infinity'. We
prove that any such tree can be mapped to a random, compact ultrametric tree
called coalescent point process, endowed with a `uniform' measure on its
boundary which is the limit as $t\to\infty$ of the properly rescaled counting
measure of the population at time $t$.
  We prove that the clonal (i.e., carrying the same allele as the root) part of
the boundary is a regenerative set that we characterize. We then study the
allelic partition of the boundary through the measures of its blocks. We also
study the dynamics of the clonal subtree, which is a Markovian increasing tree
process as mutations are removed.

variant of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations that shares exactly
the same ideal invariants (energy and helicity) and the same symmetries (under
rotations, reflexions and scale transforms) as the original equations. It is
demonstrated that the examined system displays a change in the direction of the
energy cascade when varying the value of a free parameter which controls the
relative weights of the triadic interactions between different helical Fourier
modes. The transition from a forward to inverse cascade is shown to occur at a
critical point in a discontinuous manner with diverging fluctuations close to
criticality. Our work thus supports the observation that purely isotropic and
three dimensional flow configurations can support inverse energy transfer when
interactions are altered and that inside all turbulent flows there is a
competition among forward and backward transfer mechanism which might lead to
multiple energy-containing turbulent states.

no significant evidence for a gravitational-wave signal from any of these

gravitational-wave amplitudes and ellipticities. For eight of these pulsars,
our upper limits give bounds that are improvements over the indirect spin-down
limit values. For another 32, we are within a factor of 10 of the spin-down

the advanced detector. Taken as a whole, these new results improve on previous
limits by more than a factor of two.

in \cite{ST2016}, driven by a forcing with a commutator structure of the form
$[\aL_\phi,u](\rho)=\phi*(\rho u)- (\phi*\rho)u$, where $u$ is the velocity
field and $\phi$ belongs to a rather general class of \emph{influence} or
interaction kernels.
  In this paper we quantify the large-time behavior of such systems in terms of
\emph{fast flocking} for two prototypical sub-classes of kernels: bounded
positive $\phi$'s, and singular $\phi(r) = r^{-(1+\a)}$ of order $\alpha\in
[1,2)$ associated with the action of the fractional Laplacian
$\aL_\phi=-(-\partial_{xx})^{\alpha/2}$. Specifically, we prove fast velocity
alignment as the velocity $u(\cdot,t)$ approaches a constant state, $u \to
\bar{u}$, with exponentially decaying slope and curvature bounds
$|u_x(\cdot,t)|_{\infty}+ |u_{xx}(\cdot,t)|_{\infty}\lesssim e^{-\d t}$. The
alignment is accompanied by exponentially fast flocking of the density towards
a fixed traveling state $\rho(\cdot,t) - {\rho_{\infty}}(x - \bar{u} t)

T-suppressor lymphocytes as an index of immunosuppression in HIV, cancer,
immunosenescence and inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. However, a
quantitative understanding of the impact of this ratio on the immune response
has lagged behind data and its validity as a tool for prognostic monitoring or
therapeutic target remains an open question. In this work, we use statistical
physics and dynamical systems approaches to analyze the time-dependent response
to an antigen, of a simplified model of the adaptive immune system, which
comprises B, T-helper and T-suppressor lymphocytes. The model is remarkably
robust against changes in the noise level and kinetic parameters, but it is
very sensitive to changes in the ratio between T-helper and T-suppressor
lymphocytes, exhibiting, in particular, a transition from a responsive to an
immuno-suppressed phase, as the ratio is lowered below a critical value, which
is in line with experiments. This result supports the validity of the
T-helper/T-suppressor ratio as an index of immunosuppression and may provide a
useful theoretical benchmark to interpret and compare experiments.

researched and applied in various spintronic applications. Typically the seed
layer material is studied to provide the desired face-centered cubic
(\textit{fcc}) texture to the [Co/Ni] to obtain PMA. The integration of [Co/Ni]
in back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes also requires the PMA to survive
post-annealing. In this paper, the impact of NiCr, Pt, Ru, and Ta seed layers
on the structural and magnetic properties of [Co(0.3 nm)/Ni(0.6 nm)]
multilayers is investigated before and after annealing. The multilayers were
deposited \textit{in-situ} on different seeds via physical vapor deposition at
room temperature. The as-deposited [Co/Ni] films show the required
\textit{fcc}(111) texture on all seeds, but PMA is only observed on Pt and Ru.
In-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) is obtained on NiCr and Ta seeds, which is
attributed to strain-induced PMA loss. PMA is maintained on all seeds after
post-annealing up to 400$^{\circ}$C. The largest effective perpendicular
anisotropy energy ($K_U^{\mathrm{eff}}\approx 2\times10^5$J/m$^3$) after
annealing is achieved on NiCr seed. The evolution of PMA upon annealing cannot
be explained by further crystallization during annealing or strain-induced PMA,
nor can the observed magnetization loss and the increased damping after
annealing. Here we identify the diffusion of the non-magnetic materials from
the seed into [Co/Ni] as the major driver of the changes in the magnetic
properties. By selecting the seed and post-annealing temperature, the [Co/Ni]
can be tuned in a broad range for both PMA and damping.

only uses the original training set without collecting extra data. It is
challenging in 1) how to obtain more training data only from the training set
and 2) how to use the newly generated data. In this work, the generative
adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate unlabeled samples. We propose the
label smoothing regularization for outliers (LSRO). This method assigns a
uniform label distribution to the unlabeled images, which regularizes the
supervised model and improves the baseline. We verify the proposed method on a
practical problem: person re-identification (re-ID). This task aims to retrieve
a query person from other cameras. We adopt the deep convolutional generative
adversarial network (DCGAN) for sample generation, and a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) for representation learning. Experiments show that adding
the GAN-generated data effectively improves the discriminative ability of
learned CNN embeddings. On three large-scale datasets, Market-1501, CUHK03 and
DukeMTMC-reID, we obtain +4.37%, +1.6% and +2.46% improvement in rank-1
precision over the baseline CNN, respectively. We additionally apply the

it is not taken into account in standard extended DMFT (EDMFT) calculations.
Here, we include this instantaneous term in both approaches and investigate its
effect on the phase diagram and dynamically screened interaction. We show that
the largest deviations between previously presented EDMFT and $GW$+EDMFT
results originate from the nonlocal Fock term, and that the quantitative
differences are especially large in the strong-coupling limit. Furthermore, we
show that the charge-ordering phase diagram obtained in $GW$+EDMFT methods for
moderate interaction values is very similar to the one predicted by dual boson
methods that include the fermion-boson or four-point vertex.

the feature learning and matching process. To address this problem, this paper
introduces the pose invariant embedding (PIE) as a pedestrian descriptor.
First, in order to align pedestrians to a standard pose, the PoseBox structure
is introduced, which is generated through pose estimation followed by affine
transformations. Second, to reduce the impact of pose estimation errors and
information loss during PoseBox construction, we design a PoseBox fusion (PBF)
CNN architecture that takes the original image, the PoseBox, and the pose
estimation confidence as input. The proposed PIE descriptor is thus defined as
the fully connected layer of the PBF network for the retrieval task.
Experiments are conducted on the Market-1501, CUHK03, and VIPeR datasets. We
show that PoseBox alone yields decent re-ID accuracy and that when integrated
in the PBF network, the learned PIE descriptor produces competitive performance
compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

its extension including the effects of the transverse terms (CBC-2D) and a
local streamline approach in which the problem is reformulated in the incident

tested for a variety of test cases, ranging from canonical problems (such as 2D

Reynolds number ($Re = 10^5$), representative of aeronautic applications. The
LS-LODI approach provides the best results for pure acoustics waves (plane and

transverse waves provides the best results. As regards numerical stability, a
regularized adaptation is necessary to simulate high Reynolds number flows. The
so-called regularized FD (Finite Difference) adaptation, a modified regularized

advancements to the MarCO CubeSats, particularly in propulsion and GNC, could
enable these spacecraft to get to another planet or to Near Earth Objects. This
can have substantial science return with the right science instrument. We have
developed an interplanetary CubeSat concept that includes onboard green
monopropellant propulsion system and that can get into a capture orbit around a
neighboring planet or chase a small-body. One such candidate is the Martian
moon Phobos. Because of the limits of current CubeSat hardware and lack of an
accurate ephemeris of Phobos, there will be a 2 to 5 km uncertainty in distance
between the spacecraft and Phobos. This presents a major GNC challenge when the
CubeSat first attempts to get into visual range of the moon. One solution to
this challenge is to develop optical navigation technology that enables the
CubeSat to take epicyclic orbits around the most probable location of the
target, autonomously search and home-in on the target body. In worst-case
scenarios, the technology would narrow down the uncertainty of the small-body
location and then use optical flow, a computer vision algorithm to track
movement of objects in the field of view. A dimly lit small-body can be
detected by the occlusion of one or more surrounding stars. Our studies present
preliminary simulations that support the concept.

  Parametric MDPs",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-objective verification problems of parametric Markov decision processes
under optimality criteria can be naturally expressed as nonlinear programs. We
observe that many of these computationally demanding problems belong to the
subclass of signomial programs. This insight allows for a sequential
optimization algorithm to efficiently compute sound but possibly suboptimal
solutions. Each stage of this algorithm solves a geometric programming problem.
These geometric programs are obtained by convexifying the nonconvex constraints
of the original problem. Direct applications of the encodings as nonlinear pro-
grams are model repair and parameter synthesis. We demonstrate the scalability
and quality of our approach by well-known benchmarks

Benford when c is not equal to b. This paper builds on two of my earlier papers
and is an attempt to cast some light on the issue of base dependence. Following
some introductory material, the ""Benford spectrum"" of a positive random
variable is introduced and known analytic results about Benford spectra are
summarized. Some standard machinery for a ""Benford analysis"" is introduced and
combined with my method of ""seed functions"" to yield tools to analyze the base
c Benford properties of a base b Benford random variable. Examples are
generated by applying these general methods to several families of Benford
random variables. Berger and Hill's concept of ""base-invariant significant
digits"" is discussed. Some potential extensions are sketched.

Multiverse is the same as the Level III Multiverse. By this, they mean that the
parallel universes of the Level III Multiverse can be regarded as similar or
identical copies of our own Hubble volume distributed throughout the whole of
our (possibly infinite) bubble universe. However, we show that our bubble
universe is in a single quantum eigenstate that extends to regions of space
that are receding from each other at superluminal velocities because of general
relativistic expansion. Such a bubble universe cannot accommodate Hubble
volumes in the different orthogonal eigenstates required by the Level III
Multiverse. Instead, quantum uncertainty arises from large numbers of
alternative bubble universes in Hilbert space, isolated from each other. The
conclusion of the paper is that the Level I Multiverse is not the same as the
Level III Multiverse.

technologies. Ubiquitous applications involve wearable electronics, biosensors,
flexible transparent displays, radio-frequency identifications (RFIDs),
etc.Zinc oxide (ZnO) and related materials are the most commonly used inorganic
semiconductors in flexible and transparent devices, owing to their high
electrical performance, together with low processing temperature and good
optical transparency.In this paper, we review recent advances in flexible and
transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on ZnO and related
materials.After a brief introduction, the main progresses on the preparation of
each component (substrate, electrodes, channel and dielectrics) are summarized
and discussed. Then, the effect of mechanical bending on electrical performance
was highlighted. Finally, we suggest the challenges and opportunities in future
investigations.
