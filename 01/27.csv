by the two Advanced LIGO detectors, and related to an inspiral and merger of a
binary black hole system. A gamma ray burst that could possibly be related with
the GW150914 event was observed by the Fermi satellite. It had a duration of
about 1 second and appeared about 0.4 seconds after the gravitational-wave
signal. We propose that a collapsing massive star and a black hole in a close
binary could lead to the event. The gamma ray burst was powered by a weak
neutrino flux produced in the star remnant's matter. Low spin and kick velocity
of the merged black hole are reproduced in our simulations. Coincident
gravitational-wave emission originates from the merger of the collapsed core

personalized instructor responses. In the present work, we report on the
experiences and practices of two instructors who used the GRF in an
introductory physics lab course. Our analysis draws on two sources of data: (i)
post-semester interviews with both instructors and (ii) the instructors'
written responses to 134 student reflections. Interviews focused on the
instructors' perceptions about the goals and framing of the GRF activity, and
characteristics of good or bad feedback. Their GRF responses were analyzed for
the presence of up to six types of statement: encouraging statements,
normalizing statements, empathizing statements, strategy suggestions, resource
suggestions, and feedback to the student on the structure of their reflection.
We find that both instructors used all six response types, in alignment with
their perceptions of what counts as good feedback. This exploratory qualitative
investigation demonstrates that the GRF can serve as a mechanism for
instructors to pay personal attention to their students. In addition, it opens
the door to future work about the impact of the GRF on student-teacher
interactions.

the {\em SDO/}AIA $335\textrm{\AA}$ channel reveals the characteristics of an
extreme-ultraviolet late phase event, caused by the continuous formation of new
post-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectral
fitting of {\em NuSTAR} observations yields an isothermal source, with
temperature $3.8-4.6$ MK, emission measure $0.3-1.8 \times 10^{46}\textrm{
cm}^{-3}$, and density estimated at $2.5-6.0 \times 10^8 \textrm{ cm}^{-3}$.
The observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived {\em NuSTAR}
temperature range, favoring temperature values in the range $4.0-4.3$ MK. By
examining the post-flare loops' cooling times and energy content, we estimate
that at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooled
between the onset of the flare and {\em NuSTAR} observations, with their total
thermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content at
flare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only the
flare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can lead
to a large underestimation of its value.

selection methods based on mutual information have become very popular and are

sequentially over time and across a network, yield features which are viewed as
points in or close to a union of multiple submanifolds of a Riemannian
manifold, and distinguishing disparate time series amounts to clustering
multiple Riemannian submanifolds. To support the claim that exploiting the
latent Riemannian geometry behind many statistical features of time series is
beneficial to learning from network data, this paper focuses on brain networks
and puts forth two feature-generation schemes for network-wide dynamic time
series. The first is motivated by Granger-causality arguments and uses an
auto-regressive moving average model to map low-rank linear vector subspaces,
spanned by column vectors of appropriately defined observability matrices, to
points into the Grassmann manifold. The second utilizes (non-linear)
dependencies among network nodes by introducing kernel-based partial
correlations to generate points in the manifold of positive-definite matrices.
Capitilizing on recently developed research on clustering Riemannian
submanifolds, an algorithm is provided for distinguishing time series based on
their geometrical properties, revealed within Riemannian feature spaces.
Extensive numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms

insulator. While most of the previously considered probes of dephasing dynamics
could be understood by approximating physical spin operators with local
integrals of motion, the Loschmidt echo and its generalizations crucially
depend on the full expansion of the physical operators via local integrals of
motion operators, as well as operators which flip local integrals of motion.
Hence, these probes allow to get insights into the relation between physical
operators and local integrals of motion, and access the operator spreading in
the many-body localized phase.

result of a reactive feedback system, originating in the brain-stem and spinal
cord, combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system, that is adaptively
fine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on
that interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC)
architecture, an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme in which a
feed-forward module, based on the cerebellum, steers an error feedback
controller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger
reactions as actual errors would, but that do not code for any current or
forthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy, we
derive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an
eligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular, our
eligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it
convolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context
of cerebellar physiology, this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses
should generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being
controlled. From an engineering perspective, CFPC provides a general-purpose
anticipatory control architecture equipped with a learning rule that exploits
the full dynamics of the closed-loop system.

as the spontaneous breaking of the 9-dimensional rotational symmetry to the
3-dimensional one. This result, however, was obtained after regularizing the
original matrix integration by introducing ""infrared"" cutoffs on the quadratic
moments of the Hermitian matrices. In this paper, we generalize the form of the

that the results become independent of $p$ and hence universal for $p \gtrsim
1.3$. For $p$ as large as 2.0, however, we find that large-$N$ scaling
behaviors do not show up, and we cannot take a sensible large-$N$ limit. Thus
we find that there is a certain range of $p$ in which a universal large-$N$

epistemic restriction, a constraint on what an observer can know about reality.
The aim of the model, developed for continuous and discrete prime degrees of
freedom, is to advocate the epistemic view of quantum theory, where quantum
states are states of incomplete knowledge about a deeper underlying reality.
Many aspects of quantum mechanics and protocols from quantum information can be
reproduced in the model. In spite of its significance, a number of aspects of
Spekkens' model remained incomplete. Formal rules for the update of states
after measurement had not been written down, and the theory had only been
constructed for prime-dimensional, and infinite dimensional systems. In this
work, we remedy this, by deriving measurement update rules, and extending the
framework to derive models in all dimensions, both prime and non-prime.
Stabilizer quantum mechanics is a sub-theory of quantum mechanics with
restricted states, transformations and measurements. First derived for the
purpose of constructing error correcting codes, it now plays a role in many
areas of quantum information theory. Previously, it had been shown that
Spekkens' model was operationally equivalent in the case of infinite and odd
prime dimensions. Here, exploiting known results on Wigner functions, we extend
this to show that Spekkens' model is equivalent to stabilizer quantum mechanics
in all odd dimensions, prime and non-prime. This equivalence provides new
technical tools for the study of technically difficult compound-dimensional
stabilizer quantum mechanics.

  Evaluation: A New Perspective on Deep vs. Shallow Judging",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While test collections provide the cornerstone for Cranfield-based evaluation
of information retrieval (IR) systems, it has become practically infeasible to
rely on traditional pooling techniques to construct test collections at the
scale of today's massive document collections. In this paper, we propose a new
intelligent topic selection method which reduces the number of search topics
needed for reliable IR evaluation. To rigorously assess our method, we
integrate previously disparate lines of research on intelligent topic selection
and deep vs. shallow judging. While prior work on intelligent topic selection
has never been evaluated against shallow judging baselines, prior work on deep
vs. shallow judging has largely argued for shallowed judging, but assuming
random topic selection. We argue that for evaluating any topic selection
method, ultimately one must ask whether it is actually useful to select topics,
or should one simply perform shallow judging over many topics? In seeking a
rigorous answer to this over-arching question, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation over a set of relevant factors never previously studied together
1) topic selection method 2) the effect of topic familiarity on human judging
speed and 3) how different topic generation processes impact (i) budget
utilization and (ii) the resultant quality of judgments. Experiments on NIST
TREC Robust 2003 and Robust 2004 test collections show that not only can we
reliably evaluate IR systems with fewer topics, but also that 1) when topics
are intelligently selected, deep judging is often more cost-effective than
shallow judging in evaluation reliability and 2) topic familiarity and topic
generation costs greatly impact the evaluation cost vs. reliability trade-off.
Our findings challenge conventional wisdom in showing that deep judging is
often preferable to shallow judging when topics are selected intelligently.

interface remote quantum emitters. However, this is still an outstanding
challenge, as the quantum states of dissimilar 'artificial atoms' have to be

clarify issues related to field redefinitions and frame choices. We then
propose that the action is invariant under a $Z_2$ symmetry to which we refer
as the dynamical KMS symmetry. The dynamical KMS symmetry is physically
equivalent to the previously proposed local KMS condition in the classical
limit, but is more convenient to implement and more general. It is applicable
to any states in local equilibrium rather than just thermal density matrix
perturbed by external background fields. Finally we elaborate the formulation
for a conformal fluid, which contains some new features, and work out the
explicit form of the entropy current to second order in derivatives for a
neutral conformal fluid.

environment around galaxies and galaxy clusters. The large-scale gas
circulation promoted within such cavities by the jet itself gives rise to
backflows that propagate back to the center of the jet-cocoon system, spanning
all the physical scales relevant for the AGN.
  Using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code, we study these backflows through a
series of numerical experiments, aiming at understanding how their global
properties depend on jet parameters. We are able to characterize their mass
flux down to a scale of a few kiloparsecs to about $0.5\,\mathrm{M_\odot/y}$for
as long as $15$ or $20$ Myr, depending on jet power. We find that backflows are
both spatially coherent and temporally textbf{intermittent}, independently of
jet power in the range $10^{43-45}$ erg/s.
  Using the mass flux thus measured, we model analytically the effect of
backflows on the central accretion region, where a Magnetically Arrested Disk
lies at the center of a thin circumnuclear disk. Backflow accretion onto the
disk modifies its density profile, producing a flat core and tail.
  We use this analytic model to predict how accretion beyond the BH
magnetopause is modified, and thus how the jet power is temporally modulated.
Under the assumption that the magnetic flux stays frozen in the accreting
matter, and that the jets are always launched via the Blandford-Znajek (1977)
mechanism, we find that backflows are capable of boosting the jet power up to
tenfold during relatively short time episodes (a few Myr).

host galaxies show typical characteristics of a weak active galactic nucleus
(AGN), indicative of a pre-existing accretion disc around the supermassive
black hole (SMBH). In this work, we develop an analytic model to study how a
pre-existing accretion disc affects a TDE. We assume the density of the disc
$\rho\propto R^{-\lambda}$, $R$ being the radial distance from the SMBH and
$\lambda$ varying between $0.5$ and $1.5$. Interactions between the
pre-existing accretion disc and the stream of the tidally disrupted star can
stall the stream far from the SMBH, causing a sudden drop in the rate of
fallback of gas into the SMBH. These interactions could explain the steep
cut-off observed in the light curve of some TDE candidates (e.g., ${\it Swift}$
J1644 and ${\it Swift}$ J2058). With our model, it is possible to use the time
of this cut-off to constrain some properties pertaining to the pre-existing
accretion disc, such as $\lambda$ and the disc viscosity parameter $\alpha$. We
demonstrate this by applying our theory to the TDE candidates ${\it Swift}$
J1644, ${\it Swift}$ J2058 and ASASSN-14li. Our analysis favours a disc profile
with $\lambda\sim1$ for viscosity parameters $\alpha\sim0.01-0.1$.

carefully quantified uncertainties, with a median value of $\sim 0.03$ dex). We
consider 90 red giant stars in seven open clusters and find that most stars
within a cluster have abundances in most elements that are indistinguishable
(in a $\chi^2$-sense) from those of the other members, as expected for stellar
birth siblings. An analogous analysis among pairs of $>1000$ field stars shows
that highly significant abundance differences in the 20-dimensional space can
be established for the vast majority of these pairs, and that the APOGEE-based
abundance measurements have high discriminating power. However, pairs of field
stars whose abundances are indistinguishable even at 0.03~dex precision exist:
$\sim 0.3$ percent of all field star pairs, and $\sim 1.0$ percent of field
star pairs at the same (solar) metallicity [Fe/H] = $0 \pm 0.02$. Most of these
pairs are presumably not birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather
doppelganger. Our analysis implies that 'chemical tagging' in the strict sense,
identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars through their abundance
similarity alone, will not work with such data. However, our approach shows
that abundances have extremely valuable information for probabilistic

differential lensing, where the magnification factor varies from ~3 to ~9

and a smooth source-plane velocity gradient suggest that the host galaxy is an

z~1 disk galaxies not hosting quasars. The implied gas mass fraction of
~18+/-4% is consistent with the previously-observed cosmic decline since z~2.

spectroscopic stars in a color-magnitude plane with that of the photometric

derived from the spectroscopically measured stellar density profile multiplied
by the selection function. The method is validated using Galaxia mock data with
two different selection functions. We demonstrate that the derived stellar
density profiles well reconstruct the true ones not only for the full targets,
but also for the sub-populations selected from the full dataset. Finally, the
method is applied to map the density profiles for the Galactic disk and halo,
respectively, using the LAMOST RGB stars. The Galactic disk extends to about
R=19 kpc, where the disk still contributes about 10% to the total stellar
surface density. Beyond this radius, the disk smoothly transitions to the halo
without any truncation, bending, or broken. Moreover, no over-density
corresponding to the Monoceros ring is found in the Galactic anti-center
direction. The disk shows moderate north-south asymmetry at radii larger than
12 kpc. On the other hand, the R-Z tomographic map directly shows that the

by order in perturbation theory. It is a fundamental question as to whether YM

Group and Asymptotic Freedom imply that in 't Hooft large-N expansion the
S-matrix in YM is ultraviolet finite, while in both 't Hooft and Veneziano
large-N expansions the S-matrix in confining QCD with massless quarks is
renormalizable but not ultraviolet finite. By the same argument it follows that
the large-N $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY YM S-matrix is ultraviolet finite as well.
Besides, we demonstrate that the correlators of local gauge-invariant
operators, as opposed to the S-matrix, are renormalizable but in general not
ultraviolet finite in the large-N 't Hooft and Veneziano expansions, neither in
pure YM and $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY YM nor a fortiori in massless QCD. Moreover,
we compute explicitly the counterterms that arise renormalizing the large-N 't
Hooft and Veneziano expansions, by deriving in confining massless QCD-like
theories a low-energy theorem of NSVZ type, that relates the log derivative
with respect to the gauge coupling of a $k$-point correlator, or the log
derivative with respect to the RG-invariant scale, to a $k+1$-point correlator
with the insertion of $Tr F^2$ at zero momentum. Finally, we argue that similar
results hold in the large-N limit of a vast class of confining QCD-like
theories with massive matter fields, provided a renormalization scheme exists,
as for example $\overline{MS}$, in which the beta function is independent on
the masses. In particular, in both 't Hooft and Veneziano large-N expansions
the S-matrix in confining massive QCD and massive $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD is

years, we have determined the relative stellar proper motions (providing
membership) and the absolute proper motion of the Galactic globular cluster
M71. The absolute proper motion has been used to reconstruct the cluster orbit
within a Galactic, three-component, axisymmetric potential. M71 turns out to be
in a low latitude disk-like orbit inside the Galactic disk, further supporting
the scenario in which it lost a significant fraction of its initial mass. Since
large differential reddening is known to affect this system, we took advantage
of near-infrared, ground-based observations to re-determine the cluster center
and density profile from direct star counts. The new structural parameters turn
out to be significantly different from the ones quoted in the literature. In
particular, M71 has a core and a half-mass radii almost 50% larger than
previously thought. Finally we estimate that the initial mass of M71 was likely
one order of magnitude larger than its current value, thus helping to solve the
discrepancy with the observed number of X-ray sources.

expected in a LCDM cosmological model with the low number of observed dwarfs at
a given velocity. We then explore the source of the discrepancy between
observations and theory, and conclude that the dearth of observed dwarf
galaxies is primarily explained by two effects. The first effect is that
galactic rotational velocities derived from the HI linewidth severely
underestimate the maximum halo velocity. The second effect is that a large
fraction of halos at the lowest masses are too faint to be detected by current
galaxy surveys. We find that cored dark matter density profiles can contribute
to the lower observed velocity of galaxies, but only for galaxies in which the
velocity is measured interior to the size of the core (~3 kpc).

AGNs by comparing two simulations from the HORIZON suite, which are identical
except that one also includes super massive black holes (SMBH), and related
feedback models. This allows us to cross-identify individual galaxies between
simulations and quantify the effect of AGN feedback on their properties,
including stellar mass and gas outflows. We find that massive galaxies ($ \rm
M_{*} \geq 10^{11} M_\odot $) are quenched by AGN feedback to the extent that
their stellar masses decrease by up to 80% at $z=0$. SMBHs affect their host
halo through a combination of outflows that reduce their baryonic mass,
particularly for galaxies in the mass range $ \rm 10^9 M_\odot \leq M_{*} \leq
10^{11} M_\odot $, and a disruption of central gas inflows, which limits
in-situ star formation. As a result, net gas inflows onto massive galaxies, $
\rm M_{*} \geq 10^{11} M_\odot $, drop by up to 70%. We measure a redshift
evolution in the stellar mass ratio of twin galaxies with and without AGN
feedback, with galaxies of a given stellar mass showing stronger signs of
quenching earlier on. This evolution is driven by a progressive flattening of
the $\rm M_{\rm SMBH}-M_* $ relation with redshift, particularly for galaxies
with $\rm M_{*} \leq 10^{10} M_\odot $. $\rm M_{\rm SMBH}/M_*$ ratios decrease
over time, as falling average gas densities in galaxies curb SMBH growth.

identify signatures of an outflow in both emission and absorption from a

2396, and 2365, at 1.2-2.4-1.5-2.7 x 10^-18 egs s-1 cm-2 respectively. These

combining the four non-resonant FeII* emission lines, we spatially map the
FeII* emission from an individual galaxy for the first time. The FeII* emission
has an elliptical morphology that is roughly aligned with the galaxy minor
kinematic axis, and its integrated half-light radius R_1/2,FeII* = 4.1 +- 0.4
kpc is 50% larger than the stellar continuum (R_1/2,* = 2.34 +- 0.17 kpc) or
the [OII] nebular line. Moreover, the FeII* emission shows a blue wing
extending up to -400 km/s, which is more pronounced along the galaxy minor
kinematic axis and reveals a C-shaped pattern in a p-v diagram along that axis.
These features are consistent with a bi-conical outflow.

  Approximation",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) has established itself as
a widely used method for approximate inference on Bayesian hierarchical models
which can be represented as a latent Gaussian model (LGM). INLA is based on
producing an accurate approximation to the posterior marginal distributions of
the parameters in the model and some other quantities of interest by using
repeated approximations to intermediate distributions and integrals that appear
in the computation of the posterior marginals.
  INLA focuses on models whose latent effects are a Gaussian Markov random
field (GMRF). For this reason, we have explored alternative ways of expanding
the number of possible models that can be fitted using the INLA methodology. In
this paper, we present a novel approach that combines INLA and Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC). The aim is to consider a wider range of models that cannot
be fitted with INLA unless some of the parameters of the model have been fixed.
Hence, conditioning on these parameters the model could be fitted with the
R-INLA package. We show how new values of these parameters can be drawn from
their posterior by using conditional models fitted with INLA and standard MCMC
algorithms, such as Metropolis-Hastings. Hence, this will extend the use of
INLA to fit models that can be expressed as a conditional LGM. Also, this new
approach can be used to build simpler MCMC samplers for complex models as it
allows sampling only on a limited number parameters in the model.
  We will demonstrate how our approach can extend the class of models that
could benefit from INLA, and how the R-INLA package will ease its
implementation. We will go through simple examples of this new approach before
we discuss more advanced problems with datasets taken from relevant literature.

for studying the plasmonic response of graphene-coated wires of arbitrary

electromagnetic wave and the wire substrate is homogeneous and isotropic. The
field is expressed everywhere in terms of two unknown source functions
evaluated on the graphene coating which can be obtained from the numerical
solution of a coupled pair of inhomogeneous integral equations. To assess the
validity of the Green formulation, the scattering and absorption efficiencies
obtained numerically in the particular case of circular wires are compared with
those obtained from the multipolar Mie theory. An excellent agreement is
observed in this particular case, both for metallic and dielectric substrates.
To explore the effects that the break of the rotational symmetry of the wire
section introduces in the plasmonic features of the scattering and absorption
response, the Green formulation is applied to the case of graphene-coated wires
of elliptical section. As might be expected from symmetry arguments, we find a
two-dimensional anisotropy in the angular optical response of the wire,
particularly evident in the frequency splitting of multipolar plasmonic
resonances. The comparison between the spectral position of the enhancements in
the scattering and absorption efficiency spectra for low-eccentricity
elliptical and circular wires allows us to guess the multipolar order of each
plasmonic resonance. We present calculations of the near field distribution for
different frequencies which explicitly reveal the multipolar order of the
plasmonic resonances. They also confirm the previous guess and serve as a
further test on the validity of the Green formulation.

outcome of protoplanetary disk-driven migration, and their relative dearth in
the observational data presents an important challenge to current models of
planet formation and dynamical evolution. One natural mechanism that can lead
to the dissolution of commensurabilities is stochastic orbital forcing, induced
by turbulent density fluctuations within the nebula. While this process is
qualitatively promising, the conditions under which mean motion resonances can
be broken are not well understood. In this work, we derive a simple analytic
criterion that elucidates the relationship among the physical parameters of the
system, and find the conditions necessary to drive planets out of resonance.
Subsequently, we confirm our findings with numerical integrations carried out
in the perturbative regime, as well as direct N-body simulations. Our
calculations suggest that turbulent resonance disruption depends most
sensitively on the planet-star mass ratio. Specifically, for a disk with
properties comparable to the early solar nebula with $\alpha=0.01$, only planet
pairs with cumulative mass ratios smaller than
$(m_1+m_2)/M\lesssim10^{-5}\sim3M_{\oplus}/M_{\odot}$ are susceptible to
breaking resonance at semi-major axis of order $a\sim0.1\,$AU. Although
turbulence can sometimes compromise resonant pairs, an additional mechanism
(such as suppression of resonance capture probability through disk
eccentricity) is required to adequately explain the largely non-resonant
orbital architectures of extrasolar planetary systems.

adaptation model of the human into a partially observable stochastic decision
model, which enables the robot to adapt to an adaptable human. When the human
is adaptable, the robot guides the human towards a good strategy, maybe unknown
to the human in advance. When the human is stubborn and not adaptable, the
robot complies with the human's preference in order to retain their trust. In
the shared autonomy setting, unlike many other common human-robot collaboration
settings, only the robot actions can change the physical state of the world,
and the human and robot goals are not fully observable. We address these
challenges and show in a human subject experiment that the proposed mutual
adaptation formalism improves human-robot team performance, while retaining a
high level of user trust in the robot, compared to the common approach of
having the robot strictly following participants' preference.

forests, and gradient boosting machines, accept a feature vector, and provide a
prediction. These models learn in a supervised fashion where we provide feature
vectors mapped to the expected output. It is common practice to engineer new
features from the provided feature set. Such engineered features will either
augment or replace portions of the existing feature vector. These engineered
features are essentially calculated fields based on the values of the other
features.
  Engineering such features is primarily a manual, time-consuming task.
Additionally, each type of model will respond differently to different kinds of
engineered features. This paper reports empirical research to demonstrate what
kinds of engineered features are best suited to various machine learning model
types. We provide this recommendation by generating several datasets that we
designed to benefit from a particular type of engineered feature. The
experiment demonstrates to what degree the machine learning model can
synthesize the needed feature on its own. If a model can synthesize a planned
feature, it is not necessary to provide that feature. The research demonstrated
that the studied models do indeed perform differently with various types of
engineered features.

along non-equilibrium trajectories in phenotype space. We combine these lines
of thinking by studying long-term coevolutionary dynamics of emerging lineages

investigate the evolutionary dynamics of many different systems. We find: 1)
for a given dimension of phenotype space, the coevolutionary dynamics tends to
be fast and non-stationary for an intermediate number of coexisting lineages,
but tends to stabilize as the evolving communities reach a saturation level of
diversity; and 2) the amount of diversity at the saturation level increases

well-defined automated technique for constructing active orbital spaces for use
in multi-configuration and multireference (MR) electronic structure
calculations. Concretely, the technique constructs active molecular orbitals
capable of describing all relevant electronic configurations emerging from a
targeted set of atomic valence orbitals (e.g., the metal d orbitals in a
coordination complex). This is achieved via a linear transformation of the
occupied and unoccupied orbital spaces from an easily obtainable
single-reference wavefunction (such as from a Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham
calculations) based on projectors to targeted atomic valence orbitals. We
discuss the premises, theory, and implementation of the idea, and several of
its variations are tested. To investigate the performance and accuracy, we
calculate the excitation energies for various transition metal complexes in
typical application scenarios. Additionally, we follow the homolytic bond
breaking process of a Fenton reaction along its reaction coordinate. While the
described AVAS technique is not an universal solution to the active space
problem, its premises are fulfilled in many application scenarios of transition
metal chemistry and bond dissociation processes. In these cases the technique
makes MR calculations easier to execute, easier to reproduce by any user, and
simplifies the determination of the appropriate size of the active space
required for accurate results.

modern architectures for quantum computation and quantum communication. We
consider the periodic pulse control, where the TLS is subjected to a periodic
sequence of the near-resonant Rabi driving pulses, each pulse implementing a
180$^\circ$ rotation. For small inter-pulse delays, the absorption spectrum
features a pronounced peak of stimulated emission at the pulse frequency, as
well as equidistant satellite peaks with smaller spectral weights. As long as
the detuning between the carrier frequency of the driving and the TLS
transition frequency remains moderate, this spectral shape shows little change.
Therefore, the quantum control allows shifting the absorption peak to a desired
position, and locks the absorption peak to the carrier frequency of the driving
pulses. Detailed description of the spectrum, and its evolution as a function

alternative minimum-bias (MB) jet narrative -- quantitative correspondence of
MB dijet manifestations in the hadronic final state with measured {\em isolated

emerge from inductive study of primary particle data without {\em a priori}

the absolute UV attenuation is a linearly increasing function of log stellar
mass, and the dust attenuation slope ($n$) is within the range $-0.7 \leq n
\leq-0.3$, can successfully reproduce the LF and CMR over a wide range of
stellar population synthesis model (SPS) assumptions. This range of attenuation
curves is consistent with a power-law fit to the Calzetti attenuation law in
the UV ($n=-0.55$), and other similarly `grey' star-forming galaxy attenuation
curves recently derived at $z\simeq2$. In contrast, attenuation curves as steep
as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve ($n=-1.24$) are formally
ruled out. Finally, we show that our models are consistent with recent 1.3mm

both can be achieved at the same time. In addition, error-correction for the
transmitted information can be provided while controlling the peak temperature
and/or the average power consumption.
  In general, our cooling codes use $n > k$ wires to encode a given $k$-bit
bus. One of our goals herein is to determine the minimum possible number of
wires $n$ needed to encode $k$ bits while satisfying any combination of the
three desired properties. We provide full theoretical analysis in each case. In
particular, we show that $n = k+t+1$ suffices to cool the $t$ hottest wires,
and this is the best possible. Moreover, although the proposed coding schemes
make use of sophisticated tools from combinatorics, discrete geometry, linear
algebra, and coding theory, the resulting encoders and decoders are fully
practical. They do not require significant computational overhead and can be
implemented without sacrificing a large circuit area.

Small-scale structure constraints are particularly sensitive to large lepton
asymmetries/small mixing angles which result in relatively warmer sterile
neutrino momentum distributions. We revisit Milky Way galaxy subhalo count
constraints and combine them with recent searches for X-ray emission from
sterile neutrino decays. Together they rule out models outside the mass range
7.0 keV < m_nu_s < 36 keV and lepton asymmetries smaller than 15 x 10-6 per
unit entropy density at 95 percent CI or greater. We also find that while a
portion of the parameter space remains unconstrained, the combination of
subhalo counts and X-ray data indicate the candidate 3.55 keV X-ray line signal
potentially originating from a 7.1 keV sterile neutrino decay to be disfavored

  review)",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The brain is believed to implement probabilistic reasoning and to represent
information via population, or distributed, coding. Most previous
population-based probabilistic (PPC) theories share several basic properties:
1) continuous-valued neurons; 2) fully(densely)-distributed codes, i.e.,
all(most) units participate in every code; 3) graded synapses; 4) rate coding;
5) units have innate unimodal tuning functions (TFs); 6) intrinsically noisy
units; and 7) noise/correlation is considered harmful. We present a radically
different theory that assumes: 1) binary units; 2) only a small subset of
units, i.e., a sparse distributed representation (SDR) (cell assembly),
comprises any individual code; 3) binary synapses; 4) signaling formally
requires only single (i.e., first) spikes; 5) units initially have completely
flat TFs (all weights zero); 6) units are far less intrinsically noisy than
traditionally thought; rather 7) noise is a resource generated/used to cause
similar inputs to map to similar codes, controlling a tradeoff between storage
capacity and embedding the input space statistics in the pattern of
intersections over stored codes, epiphenomenally determining correlation
patterns across neurons. The theory, Sparsey, was introduced 20+ years ago as a
canonical cortical circuit/algorithm model achieving efficient sequence
learning/recognition, but not elaborated as an alternative to PPC theories.
Here, we show that: a) the active SDR simultaneously represents both the most
similar/likely input and the entire (coarsely-ranked) similarity
likelihood/distribution over all stored inputs (hypotheses); and b) given an
input, the SDR code selection algorithm, which underlies both learning and
inference, updates both the most likely hypothesis and the entire likelihood
distribution (cf. belief update) with a number of steps that remains constant
as the number of stored items increases.

Kaib","Prevalance of Chaos in Planetary Systems Formed Through Embryo Accretion",,,"10.1016/j.icarus.2017.01.021",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formation of the solar system's terrestrial planets has been numerically
modeled in various works, and many other studies have been devoted to
characterizing our modern planets' chaotic dynamical state. However, it is
still not known whether our planet's fragile chaotic state is an expected
outcome of terrestrial planet accretion. We use a suite of numerical
simulations to present a detailed analysis and characterization of the
dynamical chaos in 145 different systems produced via terrestrial planet
formation in Kaib and Cowan (2015). These systems were created in the presence
of a fully formed Jupiter and Saturn, using a variety of different initial
conditions. They are not meant to provide a detailed replication of the actual
present solar system, but rather serve as a sample of similar systems for
comparison and analysis. We find that dynamical chaos is prevalent in roughly
half of the systems we form. We show that this chaos disappears in the majority
of such systems when Jupiter is removed, implying that the largest source of
chaos is perturbations from Jupiter. Chaos is most prevalent in systems that
form 4 or 5 terrestrial planets. Additionally, an eccentric Jupiter and Saturn
is shown to enhance the prevalence of chaos in systems. Furthermore, systems in
our sample with a center of mass highly concentrated between 0.8 -1.2 AU
generally prove to be less chaotic than systems with more exotic mass
distributions. Through the process of evolving systems to the current epoch, we
show that late instabilities are quite common in our systems. Of greatest
interest, many of the sources of chaos observed in our own solar system (such

way of using synchrotron radiation, namely using synchrotron intensity

new technique using synthetic data obtained with the 3D MHD simulations and
provide the demonstration of the practical utility of the technique by
comparing the directions of magnetic field that are obtained with PLANCK
synchrotron intensity dats to the directions obtained with PLANCK synchrotron
polarization data. We demonstrate that the synchrotron intensity gradients
(SIGs) can reliably trace magnetic field in the presence of noise and can
provide detailed maps of magnetic-field directions. We also show that the SIGs
are relatively robust for tracing magnetic fields while the low spacial
frequencies of the synchrotron image are removed. This makes the SIGs
applicable to tracing of magnetic fields using interferometric data with single
dish measurement absent. We discuss the synergy of using the SIGs together with
synchrotron polarization in order to find the actual direction of the magnetic
field and quantify the effects of Faraday rotation as well as with other ways
of studying astrophysical magnetic fields. We test our method in the presence

that formed large outflow channels and that may have altered the climate for
extensive periods during the Hesperian era. In particular, it has been
speculated that such events could have induced significant rainfall and caused
the formation of late-stage valley networks.
  We present the results of 3-D Global Climate Model simulations reproducing
the short and long term climatic impact of a wide range of outflow channel
formation events under cold ancient Mars conditions. We find that the most
intense of these events (volumes of water up to 10$^7 $km$^3$ and released at
temperatures up to 320 Kelvins) cannot trigger long-term greenhouse global
warming, regardless of how favorable are the external conditions (e.g.
obliquity and seasons). In any case, outflow channel formation events at any
atmospheric pressure are unable to produce rainfall or significant snowmelt at
latitudes below 40$^{\circ}$N.
  On the long term, for an obliquity of $\sim $45$^{\circ}$ and atmospheric
pressures $>$ 80 mbar, we find that the lake ice (formed quickly after the
outflow event) is transported progressively southward through the mechanisms of
sublimation and adiabatic cooling. At the same time, and as long as the initial
water reservoir is not entirely sublimated, ice deposits remain in the West
Echus Chasma Plateau region where hints of hydrological activity
contemporaneous with outflow channel formation events have been observed.
However, because the high albedo of ice drives Mars to even colder
temperatures, snowmelt produced by seasonal solar forcing is difficult to
attain.

actively accreting systems). In recent years, high-quality X-ray observations
have allowed for detailed measurements of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line, where
relativistic line broadening allows constraints on the spin parameter (the
X-ray reflection method). Another technique uses accretion disk models to fit
the AGN continuum emission (the continuum-fitting, or CF, method). Although
each technique has model-dependent uncertainties, these are the best empirical
tools currently available and should be vetted in systems where both techniques
can be applied. A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because
neither method can be applied to all AGN. The X-ray reflection technique
targets mostly local (z $\lesssim$ 0.1) systems, while the CF method can be
applied at higher redshift, up to and beyond the peak of AGN activity and
growth. Here, we apply the CF method to two AGN with X-ray reflection
measurements. For both the high-mass AGN, H1821+643, and the Seyfert 1, NGC
3783, we find a range in spin parameter consistent with the X-ray reflection
measurements. However, the near-maximal spin favored by the reflection method
for NGC 3783 is more probable if we add a disk wind to the model. Refinement of
these techniques, together with improved X-ray measurements and tighter BH mass
constraints, will permit this comparison in a larger sample of AGN and increase
our confidence in these spin estimation techniques.

it is more challenging comparing to traditional image search since the
relevancy is defined at the instance level.
  Existing works have demonstrated the success of many complex ensemble systems
that are typically conducted by firstly generating object proposals, and then
extracting handcrafted and/or CNN features of each proposal for matching.
However, object bounding box proposals and feature extraction are often
conducted in two separated steps, thus the effectiveness of these methods
collapses. Also, due to the large amount of generated proposals, matching speed
becomes the bottleneck that limits its application to large-scale datasets. To
tackle these issues, in this paper we propose an effective and efficient Deep
Region Hashing (DRH) approach for large-scale INS using an image patch as the
query. Specifically, DRH is an end-to-end deep neural network which consists of
object proposal, feature extraction, and hash code generation. DRH shares
full-image convolutional feature map with the region proposal network, thus
enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. Also, each high-dimensional,
real-valued region features are mapped onto a low-dimensional, compact binary
codes for the efficient object region level matching on large-scale dataset.
Experimental results on four datasets show that our DRH can achieve even better
performance than the state-of-the-arts in terms of MAP, while the efficiency is
improved by nearly 100 times.

the intrinsic profile of the UIR band. The shape of the intrinsic profile, a
sharp blue peak and an extended red tail, suggests that the UIR band originates
from a molecular vibration-rotation band with a blue band head. The fractional
area of the band-head feature indicates a spheroidal molecule, implying a
non-polar molecule and precluding rotational emission. Its rotational
temperature should be well approximated by that measured for non-polar
molecular hydrogen, ~825 K for NGC 7027. Using this temperature, and the

experience field excursions traversing many minima of their potentials during
inflation. We study this situation by analyzing the dynamics of an
axion-spectator field $\psi$, present during inflation, with a periodic
potential given by $v(\psi) = \Lambda^4 [1 - \cos (\psi / f)]$. By assuming
that the vacuum expectation value of the field is stabilized at one of its
minima, say $\psi = 0$, we compute every $n$-point correlation function of
$\psi$ up to first order in $\Lambda^4$ using the in-in formalism. This
computation allows us to identify the distribution function describing the
probability of measuring $\psi$ at a particular amplitude during inflation.
Because $\psi$ is able to tunnel between the barriers of the potential, we find
that the probability distribution function consists of a non-Gaussian
multimodal distribution such that the probability of measuring $\psi$ at a
minimum of $v(\psi)$ different from $\psi=0$ increases with time. As a result,
at the end of inflation, different patches of the Universe are characterized by
different values of the axion field amplitude, leading to important
cosmological phenomenology: (a) Isocurvature fluctuations induced by the axion
at the end of inflation could be highly non-Gaussian. (b) If the axion defines
the strength of standard model couplings, then one is led to a concrete
realization of the multiverse. (c) If the axion corresponds to dark matter, one

metasurfaces made of patterned silicon thin wafers partially covered by Si3N4
film that exhibit over 24 dB of sound transmission loss around 0.7 MHz, which
is caused by the cancelation of sound waves emitted by the resonant Si3N4
membrane and the ones through the silicon backbone in each unit cell. These
metasurfaces are expected to have high reflection with little total loss even
at ultrasonic frequency. They could be good candidates as the building blocks
for low-loss cavities, phase zone plates, and other underwater acoustic
metamaterials. As the working principle is scalable, it provides guidance for
the designs of audible underwater sound barriers as well.

we derive a smooth convex representation for its nonparametric log-likelihood

gradient boosting procedure for estimating the hazard function
nonparametrically. An illustrative implementation of the procedure using
regression trees is described to show how to recover the unknown hazard. The
generic estimator is consistent if the model is correctly specified;
alternatively, an oracle inequality can be demonstrated for tree-based models.
To avoid overfitting, boosting employs several regularization devices. One of
them is step-size restriction, but the rationale for this is somewhat
mysterious from the viewpoint of consistency. Our work brings some clarity to
this issue by revealing that step-size restriction is a mechanism for
preventing the curvature of the risk from derailing convergence.

For a reference Hamiltonian, the counterdiabatic term is constructed from the
dispersionless Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy. Then the adiabatic theorem
holds exactly for an arbitrary choice of time-dependent parameters. We use the
Hamilton-Jacobi theory to define the generalized action. The action is
independent of the history of the parameters and is directly related to the
adiabatic invariant. The dispersionless KdV hierarchy is obtained from the
classical limit of the KdV hierarchy for the quantum shortcuts to adiabaticity.
This correspondence suggests some relation between the quantum and classical
adiabatic theorems.

entity u_{S} that is definite on what is common to the elements of the
equivalence class S but is otherwise indefinite on the differences between
those elements. For instance, the #1 interpretation of a homotopy type is an
equivalence class of homotopic spaces, but the #2 interpretation, e.g., as
developed in homotopy type theory, is an abstract space (without points) that
has the properties that are in common to the spaces in the equivalence class

called paradigm-universals, e.g., `the white thing' as opposed to the #1
abstract notion of ""the set of white things"" (out of some given collection U).
The paper shows how this #2 notion of a paradigm may be mathematically modeled
using incidence matrices in Boolean logic and density matrices in probability
theory. Then we cross the bridge to the density matrix treatment of the
indefinite superposition states in quantum mechanics (QM). This connection
between the #2 abstracts in mathematics and ontic indefinite states in QM

emerging technologies, like demand response, battery storage, concentrated

subsequent stability assessment, the MST requires an explicit representation of
the number of online generation units, which affects powers system inertia and
reactive power support capability. These requirements render a fullfledged UC
model computationally intractable, so we propose unit clustering, rolling
horizon approach, and constraint reduction to increase the computational
efficiency. To showcase the capability of the proposed tool, we use a
simplified model of the Australian National Electricity Market with different
penetrations of renewable generation. The results show that the number of
online units resulting from the proposed tool is very close to the binary UC
run over a week-long horizon, which is confirmed by the loadability and inertia
analysis. That confirms the validity of the approach for long term future grid
studies, where one is more interested in finding weak points in the system

cobalt oxides. Constructing the five-orbital Hubbard model defined on the
three-dimensional cubic lattice for the $3d$ bands of
Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$, we calculate the excitonic susceptibility in the
normal state in the random-phase approximation (RPA) to show the presence of
the instability toward excitonic condensation. Based on the excitonic ground
state with a magnetic multipole obtained in the mean-field approximation, we
calculate the dynamical susceptibility of the excitonic phase in the RPA and
find that there appear the gapless collective excitation in the spin-transverse
mode (Goldstone mode) and the gapful collective excitation in the
spin-longitudinal mode (Higgs mode). Experimental relevance is discussed.

new techniques to probe magnetic fields. In MHD turbulence, the velocity
gradients are expected to be perpendicular to magnetic fields and this fact was
used by Gonsalvez-Casanova & Lazarian to introduce a new technique to trace
magnetic fields using velocity centroid gradients. The latter can be obtained
from spectroscopic observations. We apply the technique to GALFA HI survey data
and compare the directions of magnetic fields obtained with our technique with
the direction of magnetic fields obtained using PLANCK polarization. We find
excellent correspondence between the two ways of magnetic field tracing, which
is obvious via visual comparison and through measuring of the statistics of
magnetic field fluctuations obtained with the polarization data and our
technique. This suggests that the velocity centroid gradients can provide a
reliable way of measuring of the foreground magnetic field fluctuations and
thus provide a new way of separating foreground and CMB polarization signals.

positive side $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$, what is the probability that the random
walk is now on the positive side?
  The symmetric random walks which step $2n$-times can be decomposed in the
following two ways: (1) how many times the walk steps on the positive side, (2)
whether the last step is on the positive side or on the negative side. To
answer the problem above, we clarify the number of the walks classified by (1)

indicated by (1) makes the arcsine law. Combining with the decomposition with

fundamental variables of quantum electrodynamics - the quadratures of light,
which represent the cosine-wave and sine-wave components of an optical field
and constitute the quantum optical analog of position and momentum. Yet,
standard homodyne, which is used to measure the quadrature information, suffers
from a severe bandwidth limitation: While the bandwidth of optical states can
easily span many THz, standard homodyne detection is inherently limited to the
electrically accessible, MHz to GHz range, leaving a dramatic gap between the
relevant optical phenomena and the measurement capability. We demonstrate a
fully parallel optical homodyne measurement across an arbitrary optical
bandwidth, effectively lifting this bandwidth limitation completely. Using
optical parametric amplification, which amplifies one quadrature while
attenuating the other, we measure two-mode quadrature squeezing of 1.7dB below
the vacuum level simultaneously across a bandwidth of 55THz, using just one
local-oscillator - the pump. As opposed to standard homodyne, our measurement
is highly robust to detection inefficiency, and was obtained with $>50\%$ loss
in the detection channel. This broadband parametric homodyne measurement opens
a wide window for parallel processing of quantum information.

mutating a small population, we build a very large initial population which is
then culled using a recursive bi-clustering chop approach. We evaluate this

formulate a coupled jet-fluid model consisting of a set of jet transport

model, the full jet shower interacts with the medium and gets modified via
collisional and radiative processes during the propagation. Meanwhile, the
energy and momentum are deposited from the jet shower to the medium and then
evolve with the medium hydrodynamically. The full jet defined by a cone size in
the final state includes the jet shower and the particles produced from
jet-induced flow. We apply our model to calculate the full jet energy loss and
the nuclear modifications of jet rate and shape in Pb+Pb collisions at
$2.76{\rm A~TeV}$. It is found that the inclusion of jet-induced flow

$\epsilon$-equilibrium is guaranteed to exist over this grid.
  For Nash equilibrium, we prove that constant grid size (that depends on

weak approximate equilibrium. This result implies a polynomial (in the input)

  For approximate Nash equilibrium we introduce a closely related question and
prove its \emph{equivalence} to the well-known Beck-Fiala conjecture from

  For correlated equilibrium, we prove a $O(\frac{1}{\log n})$ lower-bound on
the grid size, which matches the known upper bound of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log

convergence of dynamics (any dynamic) to approximate correlated (and coarse

(UDNs), and identify which modelling factors play major roles and minor roles.
From our study, we draw the following conclusions. First, there are 3
factors/models that have a major impact on the performance of UDNs, and they
should be considered when performing theoretical analyses: i) a multi-piece
path loss model with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-lineof- sight (NLoS)
transmissions; ii) a non-zero antenna height difference between base stations
(BSs) and user equipments (UEs); iii) a finite BS/UE density. Second, there are
4 factors/models that have a minor impact on the performance of UDNs, i.e.,
changing the results quantitatively but not qualitatively, and thus their
incorporation into theoretical analyses is less urgent: i) a general multi-path
fading model based on Rician fading; ii) a correlated shadow fading model; iii)
a BS density dependent transmission power; iv) a deterministic BS/user density.
Finally, there are 5 factors/models for future study: i) a BS vertical antenna
pattern; ii) multi-antenna and/or multi-BS joint transmissions; iii) a
proportional fair BS scheduler; iv) a non-uniform distribution of BSs; v) a
dynamic time division duplex (TDD) or full duplex (FD) network. Our conclusions
can guide researchers to downselect the assumptions in their theoretical
analyses, so as to avoid unnecessarily complicated results, while still
capturing the fundamentals of UDNs in a meaningful way.

phi-contractions on a complete and bounded metric space, we introduce the
set-theoretic concept of family of functions having attractor. We prove that,
given such a family, there exist a metric on the set on which the functions are
defined and take values and a comparison function phi such that all the
family's functions are phi-contractions. In this way we obtain a generalization
for a finite family of functions of the converse of Browder's fixed point

the converse of the contraction principle and a companion of Wong's result

parts of the mid-latitudinal oceans via altimetry data. To begin with, using
geostrophic currents derived from sea-surface height anomaly data provided by
AVISO, we confirm the presence of a strong inverse flux of surface KE at scales
larger than approximately 250 km. We then compute enstrophy fluxes to help
develop a clearer picture of the underlying dynamics at smaller scales, i.e.,
250 km to 100 km. Here, we observe a robust enstrophy cascading regime, wherein
the enstrophy shows a large forward flux and the KE spectra follow an
approximate $k^{-3.5}$ power-law. Given the rotational character of the flow,
not only is this large scale inverse KE and smaller scale forward enstrophy
transfer scenario consistent with expectations from idealized studies of
three-dimensional rapidly-rotating and strongly-stratified turbulence, it also
agrees with detailed analyses of spectra and fluxes in the upper level
midlatitude troposphere. Decomposing the currents into components with greater
and less than 100 day variability (referred to as seasonal and eddy,
respectively), we find that, in addition to the eddy-eddy contribution, the
seasonal-eddy and seasonal-seasonal fluxes play a significant role in the
inverse (forward) flux of KE (enstrophy) at scales larger (smaller) than about
250 km. Taken together, we suspect, it is quite possible that, from about 250
km to 100 km, the altimeter is capturing the relatively steep portion of a
surface oceanic counterpart of the upper tropospheric Nastrom-Gage spectrum.

minimize a training error with respect to network parameters in modern neural
network learning. However, it typically suffers from proliferation of saddle
points in the high-dimensional parameter space. Therefore, it is highly
desirable to design an efficient algorithm to escape from these saddle points
and reach a parameter region of better generalization capabilities. Here, we
propose a simple extension of SGD, namely reinforced SGD, which simply adds
previous first-order gradients in a stochastic manner with a probability that
increases with learning time. As verified in a simple synthetic dataset, this
method significantly accelerates learning compared with the original SGD.
Surprisingly, it dramatically reduces over-fitting effects, even compared with
state-of-the-art adaptive learning algorithm---Adam. For a benchmark
handwritten digits dataset, the learning performance is comparable to Adam, yet
with an extra advantage of requiring one-fold less computer memory. The
reinforced SGD is also compared with SGD with fixed or adaptive momentum
parameter and Nesterov's momentum, which shows that the proposed framework is
able to reach a similar generalization accuracy with less computational costs.
Overall, our method introduces stochastic memory into gradients, which plays an
important role in understanding how gradient-based training algorithms can work
and its relationship with generalization abilities of deep networks.

years of data taking, Mu2e is expected to observe less than one background

apparatus: a straw tube tracker, measuring the electron momentum and time, a
cosmic ray veto system rejecting most of cosmic ray background and a pure CsI
crystal calorimeter, that will measure time of flight, energy and impact
position of the converted electron. The calorimeter has to operate in a harsh

We perform radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a turbulent
molecular cloud using the RAMSES-RT code. Stars are modelled using sink
particles, from which we self-consistently follow the propagation of the
ionising radiation. We study how different feedback models affect the gas
expulsion from the cloud and how they shape the final properties of the
emerging star cluster. We find that the star formation efficiency is lower for
stronger feedback models. Feedback also changes the high mass end of the
stellar mass function. Stronger feedback also allows the establishment of a
lower density star cluster, which can maintain a virial or sub-virial state. In
the absence of feedback, the star formation efficiency is very high, as well as
the final stellar density. As a result, high energy close encounters make the
cluster evaporate quickly. Other indicators, such as mass segregation,
statistics of multiple systems and escaping stars confirm this picture.
Observations of young star clusters are in best agreement with our strong
feedback simulation.

measure obtained by combining prior belief, information about the forward
operator, and noisy observational data. This measure is most often given in
terms of a density with respect to a reference measure in a high-dimensional
(or infinite-dimensional) Banach space. Although Monte Carlo sampling methods
provide a way of querying the posterior, the necessity of evaluating the
forward operator many times (which will often be a costly PDE solver) prohibits
this in practice. For this reason, many practitioners choose a suitable
Gaussian approximation of the posterior measure, in a procedure called
Laplace's method. Once generated, this Gaussian measure is a lot easier to
sample from and properties like moments are immediately acquired. This paper
derives Laplace's approximation of the posterior measure attributed to the
inverse problem explicitly as the posterior measure of a second-order
approximation of the data-misfit functional, specifically in the
infinite-dimensional setting. By use of a reverse Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we
are able to explicitly bound the Hellinger distance between the posterior and
its approximation.

in perspective distortion (which generates inconsistencies). In this paper, we
propose a novel quasi-homography warp, which effectively balances the
perspective distortion against the projective distortion in the non-overlapping

warp as the solution of a bivariate system, where perspective distortion and

homography, thus it is totally parameter-free. A comprehensive experiment shows
that a quasi-homography warp outperforms some state-of-the-art warps in urban

introduce qualitative processes that can also be quantified and give rise to
meaningful and easy-to-use article-level metrics. In our approach, the goal of
a scientist is transformed from convincing an editorial board through a
vertical process to convincing peers through an horizontal one. We argue that
such an evaluation system naturally provides the incentives and logic needed to
constantly promote quality, reproducibility, openness and collaboration in
science. The system is legally and technically feasible and can gradually lead
to the self-organized reappropriation of the scientific process by the
scholarly community and its institutions. We propose an implementation of our
evaluation system with the platform ""the Self-Journals of Science""

terms of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnetic quasiparticles
(triplons). Some mean-field approaches (MFA) to describe these systems, based
on the standard grand canonical ensemble, do not take the anomalous density
into account and leads to an internal inconsistency, as it has been shown by
Hohenberg and Martin, and may therefore produce unphysical results. Moreover,
an explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry as observed, for example, in TlCuCl3
makes the application of MFA more complicated. In the present work, we develop
a self-consistent MFA approach, similar to the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov
approximation in the notion of representative statistical ensembles, including
the effect of a weakly broken U(1) symmetry. We apply our results on
experimental data of the quantum magnet TlCuCl3 and show that magnetization
curves and the energy dispersion can be well described within this
approximation assuming that the BEC scenario is still valid. We predict that
the shift of the critical temperature Tc due to a finite exchange anisotropy is
rather substantial even when the anisotropy parameter \gamma is small, e.g.,
\Delta T_c \approx 10%$ of Tc in H = 6T and for \gamma\approx 4 \mu eV.

rigid surfaces are investigated using a torsional contact configuration where a
glass lens is continuously rotated on the rubber surface. From the inversion of
the displacement field measured at the surface of the rubber, spatially
resolved values of the steady state frictional shear stress are determined
within the non homogeneous pressure and velocity fields of the contact. For
contacts with a smooth lens, a velocity dependent but pressure independent
local shear stress is retrieved from the inversion. On the other hand, the
local shear stress is found to depend both on velocity and applied contact
pressure when a randomly rough (sand blasted) glass lens is rubbed against the
rubber surface. As a result of changes in the density of micro-asperity
contacts, the amount of light transmitted by the transparent multi-contact
interface is observed to vary locally as a function of both contact pressure
and sliding velocity. Under the assumption that the intensity of light
transmitted by the rough interface is proportional to the proportion of area
into contact, it is found that the local frictional stress can be expressed
experimentally as the product of a purely velocity dependent term, $k(v)$, by a
term representing the pressure and velocity dependence of the actual contact
area, $A/A_0$. A comparison between $k(v)$ and the frictional shear stress of
smooth contacts suggests that nanometer scale dissipative processes occurring
at the interface predominate over viscoelastic dissipation at micro-asperity
scale.

effective field theory. We first introduce a perturbative power counting rule
for the entries in the anomalous dimension matrix of operators with equal mass
dimension. The power counting is determined by the number of loops and the
difference of the indices of the two operators involved, which in turn is
defined by assuming that all terms in the standard model Lagrangian have an
equal perturbative power. Then we show that the operators with the lowest index
are unique at each mass dimension $d$, i.e., $(H^\dagger H)^{d/2}$ for even
$d\geq 4$, and $(L^T\epsilon H)C(L^T\epsilon H)^T(H^\dagger H)^{(d-5)/2}$ for
odd $d\geq 5$. Here $H,~L$ are the Higgs and lepton doublet, and $\epsilon,~C$
the antisymmetric matrix of rank two and the charge conjugation matrix,
respectively. The renormalization group running of these operators can be
studied separately from other operators of equal mass dimension at the leading
order in power counting. We compute their anomalous dimensions at one loop for
general $d$ and find that they are enhanced quadratically in $d$ due to
combinatorics. We also make connections with classification of operators in

for the description of periodic bifurcations which have recently been
discovered in descendant trees of finite p-groups. The graph theoretic concepts
of rooted in-trees with weighted vertices and edges perfectly admit an abstract
formulation of the group theoretic notions of successive extensions, nuclear
rank, multifurcation, and step size. Since all graphs in this chapter are
infinite and dense, we use methods of pattern recognition and independent
component analysis to reduce the complex structure to periodically repeating
finite patterns. The method of group cohomology yields subgraph isomorphisms
required for proving the periodicity of branches along mainlines. Finally the
mainlines are glued together with the aid of infinite limit groups whose finite
quotients form the vertices of mainlines. The skeleton of the infinite graph is
a countable union of infinite mainlines, connected by periodic bifurcations.
Each mainline is the backbone of a minimal subtree consisting of a periodically
repeating finite pattern of branches with bounded depth. A second periodicity
is caused by isomorphisms between all minimal subtrees which make up the
complete infinite graph. Only the members of the first minimal tree are
metabelian and the bifurcations, which were unknown up to now, open the long
desired door to non-metabelian extensions whose second derived quotients are
isomorphic to the metabelian groups. An application of this key result to
algebraic number theory solves the problem of p-class field towers of exact
length three.

(LyC) radiation responsible for reionizing the early Universe. Direct
observations of escaping ionizing radiation have however been few and with low

with typical escape fractions of a few percent. The mechanisms regulating this
escape need to be strongly evolving with redshift in order to account for the
Epoch of Reionization. Gas content and star formation feedback are among the
main suspects, known to both regulate neutral gas coverage and evolve with
cosmic time. In this paper, we reanalyze HST-COS spectrocopy of the first
detected local LyC leaker, Haro 11. We examine the connection between LyC
leakage and Lyman-$\alpha$ line shape, and feedback-influenced neutral ISM
properties like kinematics and gas distribution. We discuss the two extremes of
an optically thin, density bounded ISM and a riddled, optically thick,
ionization bounded ISM, and how Haro 11 fits into their theoretical
predictions. We find that the most likely ISM model is a clumpy neutral medium
embedded in a highly ionized medium with a combined covering fraction of unity
and a residual neutral gas column density in the ionized medium high enough to
be optically thick to Lyman-$\alpha$, but low enough to be at least partly
transparent to Lyman continuum and undetected in Si II. This suggests that SF
feedback and galaxy-scale interaction events play a major role in opening
passageways for ionizing radiation through the neutral medium.

to discuss how the main physical properties change with distance. In
particular, we discuss the ability of clumps to form massive stars: we estimate
the fraction of distant sources that are classified as high-mass stars-forming

in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks are unique probes of the physical
and chemical structure of planet forming regions and the processes that shape
them. The non-LTE excitation effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) are studied in a
full disk model to evaluate: (i) what the emitting regions of the different CO2
ro-vibrational bands are; (ii) how the CO2 abundance can be best traced using
CO2 ro-vibrational lines using future JWST data and; (iii) what the excitation
and abundances tell us about the inner disk physics and chemistry. CO2 is a
major ice component and its abundance can potentially test models with
migrating icy pebbles across the iceline. A full non-LTE CO2 excitation model
has been built. The characteristics of the model are tested using non-LTE slab
models. Subsequently the CO2 line formation has been modelled using a
two-dimensional disk model representative of T-Tauri disks. The CO2 gas that
emits in the 15 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m regions of the spectrum is not in LTE and
arises in the upper layers of disks, pumped by infrared radiation. The v$_2$ 15
$\mu$m feature is dominated by optically thick emission for most of the models
that fit the observations and increases linearly with source luminosity. Its
narrowness compared with that of other molecules stems from a combination of
the low rotational excitation temperature (~250 K) and the inherently narrower
feature for CO2. The inferred CO2 abundances derived for observed disks are
more than two orders of magnitude lower than those in interstellar ices
(~10$^5$), similar to earlier LTE disk estimates. Line-to-continuum ratios are
low, of order a few %, thus high signal-to-noise (S/N > 300) observations are
needed for individual line detections. Prospects of accurate abundance
retreival with JWST-MIRI and JWST-NIRSpec are discussed.

to gain insight into this parasites population dynamics in large scale salmon
farming system, we present a fully mechanistic stage-structured population
model for the salmon louse, also allowing for complexities involved in the
hierarchical structure of full scale salmon farming. The model estimates
parameters controlling a wide range of processes, including temperature
dependent demographic rates, fish size and abundance effects on louse
transmission rates, effects sizes of various salmon louse control measures, and
distance based between farm transmission rates. Model parameters were estimated
from data including 32 salmon farms, except the last production months for five
farms which were used to evaluate model predictions. We used a Bayesian
estimation approach, combining the prior distributions and the data likelihood
into a joint posterior distribution for all model parameters. The model
generated expected values that fitted the observed infection levels of the
chalimus, adult female and other mobile stages of salmon lice, reasonably well.
Predictions for the time periods not used for fitting the model were also
consistent with the observational data. We argue that the present model for the
population dynamics of the salmon louse in aquaculture farm systems may
contribute to resolve the complexity of processes that drive that drive this

derive a natural semi-implicit rank adaption strategy. We further prove that
the standard ALS microsteps for completion problems are only stable on
manifolds of fixed ranks, and only around points that have what we define as
$\textit{internal tensor restricted isometry property, iTRIP}$. In conclusion,

0.954 g/cm$^3$ and depend severely on the presence of chemical bonds in the
system. Chemical compounds exist at the lowest temperature $T_i$ = $T_e$ = 5 kK
considered; they are destroyed rapidly at the growth of $T_i$ and slower at the
increase of $T_e$. A significant number of bonds are present in the system at 5
kK $\le$ $T_i$ $\le$ $T_e$ $\le$ 10 kK. The destruction of bonds correlates
with the growth of specific energy and static electrical conductivity under
these conditions.

the captured sensors but still cannot simply ignore them due to the multiple

(WBANs) is referred to as coexistence. The interference is most likely to
affect the communication links and degrade the performance when sensors of
different WBANs simultaneously transmit using the same channel. In this paper,
we propose a distributed approach that adapts to the size of the network, i.e.,
the number of coexisting WBANs, and to the density of sensors forming each
individual WBAN in order to minimize the impact of co-channel interference
through dynamic channel hopping based on Latin rectangles. Furthermore, the
proposed approach opts to reduce the overhead resulting from channel hopping,
and lowers the transmission delay, and saves the power resource at both sensor-
and WBAN-levels. Specifically, we propose two schemes for channel allocation
and medium access scheduling to diminish the probability of inter-WBAN
interference. The first scheme, namely, Distributed Interference Avoidance
using Latin rectangles (DAIL), assigns channel and time-slot combination that
reduces the probability of medium access collision. DAIL suits crowded areas,
e.g., high density of coexisting WBANs, and involves overhead due to frequent
channel hopping at the WBAN coordinator and sensors. The second scheme, namely,
CHIM, takes advantage of the relatively lower density of collocated WBANs to
save power by hopping among channels only when interference is detected at the
level of the individual nodes. We present an analytical model that derives the
collision probability and network throughput. The performance of DAIL and CHIM
is further validated through simulations.

channels. At the receiver, a iterative joint decoder consisting of two
component LDPC decoders is considered where the encoded bits at the output of
each component decoder are used at the other decoder as the a priori
information. We first provide asymptotic performance analysis using the concept
of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Compared to the conventional
EXIT charts devised to analyze LDPC codes for point to point communication, the
proposed EXIT charts have been completely modified to able to accommodate the
systematic nature of the codes as well as the iterative behavior between the
two component decoders. Then the developed modified EXIT charts are deployed to
design ensembles for different levels of correlation. Our results show that as
the average degree of the designed ensembles grow, the thresholds corresponding
to the designed ensembles approach the capacity. In particular, for ensembles
with average degree of around 9, the gap to capacity is reduced to about 0.2dB.
Finite block length performance evaluation is also provided for the designed

by the required angle at the split point as well as to smoothly change the
curvature of the loop. As a result, the error of approximation of a hysteresis
loop by the improved model does not exceed 1%, which is several times less than
the error of the existing model. The improved model is capable of approximating
most of the known types of rate-independent symmetrical hysteresis loops
encountered in the practice of physical measurements. The model allows building
smooth, piecewise-linear, hybrid, minor, mirror-reflected, inverse, reverse,
double and triple loops. One of the possible applications of the model
developed is linearization of a probe microscope piezoscanner. The improved
model can be found useful for the tasks of simulation of scientific instruments
that contain hysteresis elements.

including that of an initially turbulent boundary layer subjected to strong
favourable pressure gradients. Available turbulence models have hitherto been
unsuccessful in correctly predicting boundary layer parameters for such flows.
Narasimha and Sreenivasan \cite{narasimha1973relaminarization} proposed a
quasi-laminar theory (QLT) based on a two-layer model to explain the later
stages of relaminarization. This theory showed good agreement with the
experimental data available, which at the time was at relatively low $Re$. QLT,
therefore, could not be validated at high $Re$.
  Some of the more recent experiments report for the first time comprehensive
studies of a relaminarizing flow at relatively high Reynolds numbers (of order
$5\times 10^3$ in momentum thickness), where all the boundary layer quantities
of interest are measured. In the present work, the two-layer model is revisited
for these relaminarizing flows with an improved code in which the inner-layer
equations for quasi-laminar theory have been solved exactly. It is shown that
even for high-$Re$ flows with high acceleration, QLT provides a much superior
match with the experimental results than the standard turbulent boundary layer
codes. This agreement can be seen as strong support for QLT, which therefore
has the potential to be used in RANS simulations along with turbulence models.

that has been used successfully in myriad applications in many fields.
Generalized mutual information measures that go beyond classical Shannon mutual
information have also received much interest in these applications. We derive
the mean squared error convergence rates of kernel density-based plug-in
estimators of general mutual information measures between two multidimensional
random variables $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ for two cases: 1) $\mathbf{X}$
and $\mathbf{Y}$ are continuous; 2) $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ may have any
mixture of discrete and continuous components. Using the derived rates, we
propose an ensemble estimator of these information measures called GENIE by
taking a weighted sum of the plug-in estimators with varied bandwidths. The
resulting ensemble estimators achieve the $1/N$ parametric mean squared error
convergence rate when the conditional densities of the continuous variables are
sufficiently smooth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
nonparametric mutual information estimator known to achieve the parametric
convergence rate for the mixture case, which frequently arises in applications
(e.g. variable selection in classification). The estimator is simple to
implement and it uses the solution to an offline convex optimization problem
and simple plug-in estimators. A central limit theorem is also derived for the
ensemble estimators and minimax rates are derived for the continuous case. We
demonstrate the ensemble estimator for the mixed case on simulated data and
apply the proposed estimator to analyze gene relationships in single cell data.

are still lacking. In this study, we have presented a new method for prediction

method hinges on a function- and interaction-annotated protein domain profile
database, called fiDPD, which was built from the Structural Classification of
Proteins (SCOP) database, using a hidden Markov model program. The method was
applied to 13 target proteins from the recent Critical Assessment of Structure

prediction of PLIs. Our method reveals that PLIs are conserved during the

superconductors and calculate $\alpha_{xy}$ and the magnetization ${\bf M}$
over the entire range of experimentally accessible values of field, temperature
and doping. We argue that $\alpha_{xy}$ and ${\bf M}$ are both determined by
the equilibrium properties of the superconducting fluctuations (and not their
dynamics) despite the former being a transport quantity. Thus, the
experimentally observed correlation between the Nernst signal and the
magnetization arises primarily from the correlation between $\alpha_{xy}$ and
${\bf M}$. Further, there exists a dimensionless ratio ${\bf M}/(T
\alpha_{xy})$ that quantifies this correlation. We calculate, for the first
time, this ratio over the entire phase diagram of the cuprates and find it
agrees with previous results obtained in specific parts of the phase diagram.
We conclude that that there appears to be no sharp distinction between the
regimes dominated by phase fluctuations and Gaussian fluctuations for this
ratio in contrast to $\alpha_{xy}$ and ${\bf M}$ individually. The utility of
this ratio is that it can be used to determine the extent to which
superconducting fluctuations contribute to the Nernst effect in different parts
of the phase diagram given the measured values of magnetization.

protein folding researches. Experimental and theoretical investigations had
been set out to catch nonnative contacts that might dominate key events in
protein folding. However, energetic frustrations caused by nonnative
inter-residue interactions are not systematically characterized, due to the
complicated folding mechanism. Recently, we studied the folding of a set of
homologous all-{\alpha} proteins and found that nonnative-contact-based
energetic frustrations are closely related to protein native-contact networks.
In this paper, we studied the folding of nine homologous immunoglobulin-like
(Ig-like) \b{eta}-sandwich proteins and examined energetic frustrations caused
by nonnative inter-residue interactions, based on analyses of residual
phi-values and contact maps of transition state ensembles. The proteins share
similar tertiary structures, thus minimize topology frustration differences in
protein folding and highlighting the effects of energetic frustrations as
caused by hydrophilic-hydrophobic mutations. Our calculations showed that
energetic frustrations have highly heterogeneous effects on the folding of most
secondary structures and on the folding correlations between different
folding-patches of \b{eta}-sandwich proteins. The simulations revealed a strong
interplay between energetic frustrations and native-contact networks in
\b{eta}-sandwich domains, which ensures that \b{eta}-sandwich domains follow a
common folding mechanism. Our results suggested that the folding processes of
\b{eta}-sandwich proteins might be redesigned by carefully manipulating
energetic frustrations at residue level.

articulated by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as follows: ""How do we

Causal Frame Problem (CFP). Assuming that a reasoner's mental causal model can
be (implicitly) represented by a causal Bayes net, we first introduce a notion
called Potential Level (PL). PL, in essence, encodes the relative position of a
node with respect to its neighbors in a causal Bayes net. Drawing on the
psychological literature on causal judgment, we substantiate the claim that PL
may bear on how time is encoded in the mind. Using PL, we propose an inference
framework, called the PL-based Inference Framework (PLIF), which permits a
boundedly-rational approach to the CFP to be formally articulated at Marr's
algorithmic level of analysis. We show that our proposed framework, PLIF, is
consistent with a wide range of findings in causal judgment literature, and
that PL and PLIF make a number of predictions, some of which are already
supported by existing findings.

We analyze the influence of the electron component and the background matter on

We also compare and contrast these results in the case of compressed,

Bayesian network that relaxes its two main building blocks. On the one hand,
the local probabilities are allowed to be partially specified. On the other
hand, the assessments of independence do not have to hold exactly.
Conceptually, these two features turn credal networks under epistemic
irrelevance into a powerful alternative to Bayesian networks, offering a more
flexible approach to graph-based multivariate uncertainty modelling. However,
in practice, they have long been perceived as very hard to work with, both
theoretically and computationally.
  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that this perception is no longer
justified. We provide a general introduction to credal networks under epistemic
irrelevance, give an overview of the state of the art, and present several new
theoretical results. Most importantly, we explain how these results can be
combined to allow for the design of recursive inference methods. We provide
numerous concrete examples of how this can be achieved, and use these to
demonstrate that computing with credal networks under epistemic irrelevance is
most definitely feasible, and in some cases even highly efficient. We also
discuss several philosophical aspects, including the lack of symmetry, how to
deal with probability zero, the interpretation of lower expectations, the
axiomatic status of graphoid properties, and the difference between updating
and conditioning.

degree of approximation in cross section calculations. This assumption seems
very reasonable since the neutrino masses are extremely small and the neutrinos
are ultrarelativistic fermions at the energy scales of current experiments.
Consequently, in cross section calculations in the Quantum Field Theory, the
Standard Model neutrinos are frequently assumed to be described by 100%
negative helicity states. This assumption is true in a sense that in the
Standard Model processes the positive helicity states can be safely neglected
for ultrarelativistic neutrinos. On the other hand, the assumption tacitly
assert that the neutrino fields are completely longitudinally polarized, i.e.,
the contribution to the cross section coming from transverse polarization can
be neglected. We show that this tacit assertion is not correct. Although the
Standard Model cross section for a neutrino with positive helicity goes to zero
as m-> 0, the cross section for a neutrino with transverse polarization remains
finite in that limit. Thus the contribution coming from transverse polarization
cannot be neglected even in the ultrarelativistic/zero-mass limit. We examine
the consequences of this fact and deduce that it has some unexpected results in
the neutrino cross sections.

solution of Einstein-Maxwell's field equations. We ansatz the metric potential
$g_{00}$ of the form given by Maurya el al. (arXiv:1607.05582v1) with $n=2$. In
their article it is mentioned that for $n=2$ the solution is not well-behaved
for neutral configuration as the speed of sound is non-decreasing radially
outward. However, the solution can represent a physically possible
configuration with the inclusion of some net electric charged i.e. the solution
can become a well-behaved solution with decreasing sound speed radially outward
for a charged configuration. Due to the inclusion of electric charged the
solution leads to a very stiff equation of state (EoS) with the velocity of
sound at the center $v_{r0}^2=0.819, ~v_{t0}^2=0.923$ and the compactness
parameter $u=0.823$ is closed to the Buchdahl limit 0.889. This stiff EoS
support a compact star configuration of mass $5.418M_\odot$ and radius of $10.1
km$.

time-depended quantum oscillatory phenomena, coherence and supersymmetry. It
will be proved that this approach generates minimum uncertainty coherent states
of time-dependent oscillators, which in the dissociation (classical) limit
reduce to the functions describing growth (regression) of the systems evolving
over time. The results obtained reveal existence of a new class of macroscopic
quantum (or quasi-quantum) phenomena, which may play a vital role in coherent
formation of the specific growth patterns in complex systems.

associated with chemical reactions. Such instruments operate in the
\textit{surface-volume} configuration, in which ligand molecules are convected
through a fluid-filled volume over a surface to which receptors are confined.
Currently, scientists are using optical biosenors to measure the kinetic rate
constants associated with DNA translesion synthesis--a process critical to DNA
damage repair. Biosensor experiments to study this process involve multiple
interacting components on the sensor surface. This multiple-component biosensor
experiment is modeled with a set of nonlinear integrodifferential equations
(IDEs). It is shown that in physically relevant asymptotic limits these
equations reduce to a much simpler set of Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs). To verify the validity of our ODE approximation, a numerical method for
the IDE system is developed and studied. Results from the ODE model agree with
simulations of the IDE model, rendering our ODE model useful for parameter
estimation.

the ponderomotive force, the friction stabilizes the system oscillations near
