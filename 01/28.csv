because none of the two-body subsystem interactions are strong enough to bind

the core of a Borromean nucleus is purely continuum, similarly to the spectrum
of a free neutron, but two valence neutrons are bound up in such a core. Most
of the usual approaches do not use the true continuum to solve the three-body
problem but use a discrete basis, like for example, wave functions in a finite
box. In this paper the proper continuum is used to solve the pairing
Hamiltonian in the continuum spectrum of energy by using the single particle
level density devoid of the free gas. It is shown that the density defined in
this way modulates the pairing in the continuum. The partial-wave occupation
probabilities for the Borromean nuclei $^6$He and $^{11}$Li are calculated as a
function of the pairing strength. While at the threshold strength the
$(s_{1/2})^2$ and $(p_{3/2})^2$ configurations are equally important in $^6$He,
the $(s_{1/2})^2$ configuration is the main one in $^{11}$Li. For very small
strength the $(s_{1/2})^2$ configuration becomes the dominant in both Borromean

a good agreement with other methods and experimental data which indicates that
this simple model grasps the essence of the pairing in the continuum.

the most common FM approaches is to use periodic keepalive messages. Hence,
switches and routers are required to transmit a large number of FM messages
periodically, requiring a hardware-based packet generator that periodically
transmits a set of messages that are stored in an expensive on-chip memory.
With the rapid growth of carrier networks, and as 5G technologies emerge, the
number of users and the traffic rates are expected to significantly increase
over the next few years. Consequently, we expect the on-chip memories used for
FM to become a costly component in switch and router chips. We introduce a
novel approach in which FM messages are stored in compressed form in the
on-chip memory, allowing to significantly reduce the memory size. We present
FM-Delta, a simple hardware-friendly delta encoding algorithm that allows FM
messages to be compressed by a factor of 2.6. We show that this compression

sequence of length $n - t$, $t > 0$, and the question of interest is to
determine the smallest value of $k$ such that the $k$-deck, along with the
subsequences, allows for reconstructing the original sequence in an error-free
manner. We first consider the case that one is given a single subsequence of
the sequence of length $n - t$, obtained by deleting zeros only, and seek the
value of $k$ that allows for hybrid reconstruction. We prove that in this case,
$k \in [\log t+2, \min\{ t+1, O(\sqrt{n \cdot (1+\log t)}) \} ]$. We then
proceed to extend the single-subsequence setup to the case where one is given

application areas and for many reasons today. Different family members, called
variants, are derived by switching statically configurable options (features)
on and off, while reuse of the common code is maximized.
  Inquiry. Verification of program families is challenging since the number of
variants is exponential in the number of features. Existing single-program
analysis and verification tools cannot be applied directly to program families,
and designing and implementing the corresponding variability-aware versions is
tedious and laborious.
  Approach. In this work, we propose a range of variability-related
transformations for translating program families into single programs by
replacing compile-time variability with run-time variability (non-determinism).
The obtained transformed programs can be subsequently analyzed using the
conventional off- the-shelf single-program analysis tools such as type
checkers, symbolic executors, model checkers, and static analyzers.
  Knowledge. Our variability-related transformations are outcome-preserving,
which means that the relation between the outcomes in the transformed single
program and the union of outcomes of all variants derived from the original
program family is equality.
  Grounding. We show our transformation rules and their correctness with
respect to a minimal core imperative language IMP. Then, we discuss our
experience of implementing and using the transformations for efficient and
effective analysis and verification of real-world C program families.
  Importance. We report some interesting variability-related bugs that we
discovered using various state-of-the-art single-program C verification tools,
such as Frama-C, Clang, LLBMC.

by presentation of necessary tools closely related to those acting on a space
of spatial multipartite quantum states. We show that in similarity to monogamy
of quantum entanglement in space, quantum entanglement in time is also endowed
with this property for a particular history. Basing on these observations, we
discuss further bounding of temporal correlations and derive analytically the
Tsirelson bound implied by entangled histories for the Leggett-Garg

develop much of their applications declaratively. However, one aspect of the
application, namely its business-logic is constantly left imperative. In this
work we present Application Embedding, a novel approach to application
development which allows all aspects of an application, including its
business-logic, to be programmed declaratively.
  We develop this approach in a two-step process. First, we draw a mapping
between web applications and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). Second, we note
that out of the two methods for implementing DSLs, namely as either internal or
external, most traditional web applications correspond to external DSLs, while
the the technique that corresponds to DSL embedding (implementing internal
DSLs) is left mostly unexplored.
  By projecting the well-known technique of DSL embedding onto web
applications, we derive a novel technique--Application Embedding. Application
embedding offers a separation of code assets that encourages reuse of
imperative code, while keeping all application-specific assets, including those
specifying its business- logic, declarative.
  As validation, we implemented a simple, though nontrivial web application
using the proposed separation of assets. This implementation includes an
application-agnostic imperative host application named FishTank, intended to be
applicable for a wide variety of web applications, and a declarative definition
of the different aspects of the specific application, intended to be loaded on
that host.
  Our method of separation of code assets facilitates a better separation of
work, in comparison to traditional methods. By this separation, host
application developers can focus mostly on the extra-functional aspects of a
web application, namely on improving performance, scalability, and
availability, while developers of an embedded application can focus on the
functional aspects of their application, without worrying about extra-
functional concerns. The reusability of the host application makes the effort
put into a better implementation cost-effective, since it can benefit all
applications built on top of it.

through the successive-cancellation algorithm. To improve its error-correction
performance, a list-based version called successive-cancellation list (SCL) has
been proposed in the past, that however substantially increases the number of
time-steps in the decoding process. The simplified SCL (SSCL) decoding
algorithm exploits constituent codes within the polar code structure to greatly
reduce the required number of time-steps without introducing any
error-correction performance loss. In this paper, we propose a faster decoding
approach to decode one of these constituent codes, the Rate-1 node. We use this
Rate-1 node decoder to develop Fast-SSCL. We demonstrate that only a
list-size-bound number of bits needs to be estimated in Rate-1 nodes and
Fast-SSCL exactly matches the error-correction performance of SCL and SSCL.
This technique can potentially greatly reduce the total number of time-steps
needed for polar codes decoding: analysis on a set of case studies show that
Fast-SSCL has a number of time-steps requirement that is up to 66.6% lower than
SSCL and 88.1% lower than SCL.

collection of time-frequency shifts of a non-zero square integrable function on
$\mathbb{R}$ is linearly independent. This longstanding conjecture remains
largely open even in the case when the function is assumed to be smooth.
Nonetheless, the conjecture has been proved for some special families of
functions and/or special sets of points. The main contribution of this paper is
an inductive approach to investigate the HRT conjecture based on the following
question. Suppose that the HRT is true for a given set of ($N$) points and a
given function. We characterize the set of all new points such that the
conjecture remains true for the same function and the set of $N+1$ points
obtained by adding one of these new points to the original set. To achieve this
we introduce a real-valued function whose global maximizers describe when the
HRT is true. To motivate this new approach we re-derive the HRT for sets of $3$
points. Subsequently, we establish new results for points in $(1,n)$
configurations, and for a family of symmetric $(2,3)$ configurations.
Furthermore, we use these results and the refinements of other known ones to
prove that the HRT holds for certain families of $4$ points. In particular, we
show that the HRT holds for any set of $4$ points and any real-valued Schwartz
function.

system of populations in presence of time delay. The consequence of the
presence of the time delay is that the nonlinear dynamics of the studied system
become more rich, e.g., new orbits in the phase space of the system arise which
are dependent on the time-delay parameters. In more detail we introduce a time
delay and generalize the model system of differential equations for the
interaction of three populations based on generalized Volterra equations in
which the growth rates and competition coefficients of populations depend on
the number of members of all populations
\cite{Dimitrova2001a},\cite{Dimitrova2001b} and then numerically solve the
system with and without time delay. We use a modification of the method of
Adams for the numerical solution of the system of model equations with time

Motivated by the simplicity of this model, in this article we address a

addition of an extra real singlet scalar field in the dark sector. We analyze
the physical constraints on the model and show that the new annihilation and/or

single particle, for example an atom or a molecule, is confined in a container
coupled to a single heat bath. The container can be separated into two parts by
a moveable wall acting as a piston. In a single cycle of the engine, work can
be extracted from the information on which side of the piston the particle

erasure of one bit of information costs the entropy kB ln 2, exemplifying the
fundamental relation between work, heat and information. Here we apply the

We find that a working medium of a number of bosons (larger or equal two) with
attractive interactions is clearly superior to other previously discussed
setups. In sharp contrast to the classical case, we find that the average work

attention in recent years, with a focus on social networks, analysis of a

labeled nodes, motivated by applications in neuroimaging. Brain networks are
constructed from imaging data to represent functional connectivity between
regions of the brain, and previous work has shown the potential of such
networks to distinguish between various brain disorders, giving rise to a
network classification problem. Existing approaches tend to either treat all
edge weights as a long vector, ignoring the network structure, or focus on
graph topology as represented by summary measures while ignoring the edge
weights. Our goal is to design a classification method that uses both the
individual edge information and the network structure of the data in a
computationally efficient way, and that can produce a parsimonious and
interpretable representation of differences in brain connectivity patterns

weights as predictors but incorporates the network nature of the data via
penalties that promote sparsity in the number of nodes, in addition to the
usual sparsity penalties that encourage selection of edges. We implement the
method via efficient convex optimization and provide a detailed analysis of

of a system's dynamics. Mechanistic models, parameterized by a number of
unknown parameters, are often used for this purpose. Accurate estimation of the
model state and parameters prior to prediction is necessary, but may be
complicated by issues such as noisy data and uncertainty in parameters and
initial conditions. At the other end of the spectrum exist nonparametric
methods, which rely solely on data to build their predictions. While these
nonparametric methods do not require a model of the system, their performance
is strongly influenced by the amount and noisiness of the data. In this
article, we consider a hybrid approach to modeling and prediction which merges
recent advancements in nonparametric analysis with standard parametric methods.
The general idea is to replace a subset of a mechanistic model's equations with
their corresponding nonparametric representations, resulting in a hybrid
modeling and prediction scheme. Overall, we find that this hybrid approach
allows for more robust parameter estimation and improved short-term prediction
in situations where there is a large uncertainty in model parameters. We
demonstrate these advantages in the classical Lorenz-63 chaotic system and in
networks of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons before application to experimentally
collected structured population data.

significantly enhanced barrier height compared to thermal AlOx. These

thus negligible in a concentrated electrolyte. Contrary to this conventional

increasing function of ion concentration and Bjerrum length for concentrated

directly the scaling of the screening length with Bjerrum length. Furthermore,

based on their spectra, such a pairing is unlikely given their faint visual
magnitudes. Spectral modeling suggests effective temperatures and bolometric
luminosities similar to those of other early-type LMC WNs but with mass-loss
rates that are three to five times lower than expected. They additionally
retain a significant amount of hydrogen, with nitrogen at its CNO-equilibrium

we discuss why these stars did not evolve through quasi-homogeneous evolution.
Instead we suggest that based on a link with long-duration gamma ray bursts,
they may form in lower metallicity environments. A new survey in M33, which has
a large metallicity gradient, is underway.

planets survive migration, and (2) articulating the process by which
protoplanetary disks disperse---and in particular how they accrete onto their
central stars. We can go a long way toward solving both problems if the disk
gas surrounding planets has no intrinsic diffusivity (""viscosity""). In
inviscid, laminar disks, a planet readily repels gas away from its orbit. On
short timescales, zero viscosity gas accumulates inside a planet's orbit to
slow Type I migration by orders of magnitude. On longer timescales, multiple
super-Earths (distributed between, say, $\sim$0.1--10 AU) can torque inviscid
gas out of interplanetary space, either inward to feed their stars, or outward
to be blown away in a wind. We explore this picture with 2D hydrodynamics
simulations of Earths and super-Earths embedded in inviscid disks, confirming
their slow/stalled migration even under gas-rich conditions, and showing that
disk transport rates range up to $\sim$$10^{-7} M_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and
scale as $\dot{M} \propto \Sigma M_{\rm p}^{3/2}$, where $\Sigma$ is the disk
surface density and $M_{\rm p}$ is the planet mass. Gas initially sandwiched
between two planets is torqued past both into the inner and outer disks. In
sum, sufficiently compact systems of super-Earths can clear their natal disk
gas, in a dispersal history that may be complicated and non-steady, but which
conceivably leads over Myr timescales to large gas depletions similar to those
characterizing transition disks.

disrupted by massive black holes (BHs), ranging from planets to evolved stars.
Through their tidal disruption, main sequence and evolved stars can effectively
probe the existence of otherwise quiescent supermassive BHs and white dwarfs
can probe intermediate mass BHs. Many low-mass white dwarfs possess extended
hydrogen envelopes, which allow for the production of prompt flares in
disruptive encounters with moderately massive BHs of $10^5$ to
$10^7~M_\odot$--masses that may constitute the majority of massive BHs by
number. These objects are a missing link in two ways: (1) for probing
moderately massive BHs and (2) for understanding the hydrodynamics of the
disruption of objects with tenuous envelopes. A flare arising from the tidal
disruption of a $0.17~M_\odot$ white dwarf by a $10^5~M_\odot$ BH reaches a
maximum between 0.6 and 11 days, with a peak fallback rate that is usually
super-Eddington and results in a flare that is likely brighter than a typical
tidal disruption event. Encounters stripping only the envelope can provide
hydrogen-only fallback, while encounters disrupting the core evolve from H- to
He-rich fallback. While most tidal disruption candidates observed thus far are
consistent with the disruptions of main sequence stars, the rapid timescales of
nuclear transients such as Dougie and PTF10iya are naturally explained by the
disruption of low-mass white dwarfs. As the number of observed flares continues
to increase, the menu presented here will be essential for characterizing
nuclear BHs and their environments through tidal disruptions.

run including two different sets of baryonic physics: one accounts for
radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment and supernova (SN)
feedback, and the other one further includes the effects of feedback from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). In agreement with observations, we find an
anti-correlation between entropy and metallicity in cluster cores, and similar
radial distributions of heavy-element abundances and abundance ratios out to
large cluster-centric distances (~R180). In the outskirts, namely outside of
~0.2R180, we find a remarkably homogeneous metallicity distribution, with
almost flat profiles of the elements produced by either SNIa or SNII. We
investigated the origin of this phenomenon and discovered that it is due to the
widespread displacement of metal-rich gas by early (z>2-3) AGN powerful bursts,
acting on small high-redshift haloes. Our results also indicate that the
intrinsic metallicity of the hot gas for this sample is on average consistent
with no evolution between z=2 and z=0, across the entire radial range.

measurement of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the Baryon Oscillation

the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the tension between datasets,
we find that the tensions are relieved by an evolving DE, with the dynamical DE
model preferred at a $3.5\sigma$ significance level based on the improvement in
the fit alone. While, at present, the Bayesian evidence for the dynamical DE is
insufficient to favour it over $\Lambda$CDM, we show that, if the current best

square lattice is incorporated as ${\cal LM}(2,3)$ in the family of Yang-Baxter
integrable logarithmic minimal models ${\cal LM}(p,p')$. We consider this model
in the presence of boundaries and with periodic boundary conditions. Inspired
by Kuniba, Sakai and Suzuki, we rewrite the recently obtained infinite
$Y$-system of functional equations. We obtain nonlinear integral equations in
the form of a closed finite set of TBA equations described by a $D_3$ Dynkin
diagram. Following the methods of Kl\""umper and Pearce, we solve the TBA
equations for the conformal finite-size corrections. For the ground states of
the standard modules on the strip, these agree with the known central charge
$c=0$ and conformal weights $\Delta_{1,s}$ for $s\in {\Bbb Z_{\ge 1}}$ with
$\Delta_{r,s}= \big((3r-2s)^2-1\big)/24$. For the periodic case, the
finite-size corrections agree with the conformal weights $\Delta_{0,s}$,
$\Delta_{1,s}$ with $s\in\frac12\Bbb Z_{\ge0}$. These are obtained analytically
using Rogers dilogarithm identities. We incorporate all finite excitations by
formulating empirical selection rules for the patterns of zeros of all the
eigenvalues of the standard modules. We thus obtain the conformal partition
functions on the cylinder and the modular invariant partition function (MIPF)
on the torus. By applying $q$-binomial identities, it is shown that our
finitized characters on the strip agree with those of Pearce, Rasmussen and
Zuber. On the torus, the MIPF is a non-diagonal sesquilinear form in affine
$u(1)$ characters given by the $u(1)$ partition function
$Z_{2,3}(q)=Z_{2,3}^{\rm{Circ}}(q)$. This is compatible with the general
conjecture of Pearce and Rasmussen, namely
$Z_{p,p'}(q)=Z^{\rm{Proj}}_{p,p'}(q)+n_{p,p'}Z^{\rm{Min}}_{p,p'}(q)$ with
$n_{p,p'}\in {\Bbb Z}$, and the lattice derivation fixes $n_{2,3}=-1$.

half-light radii from the galaxy center. We measure a Tip of the Red Giant

or 264$\pm$6 kpc from M31), which is consistent with the Pan-STARRS1 distance.
We use a maximum-likelihood technique to derive structural properties for the

(728$\pm$47 pc), ellipticity ($\epsilon$) of 0.44$\pm$0.03, total magnitude

require knowledge of the target signatures of the sources a priori, nor does it
exploit classical methods based on a particular decay rate of the energy
emitted from the sources as a function of range. General structural properties
of the signatures such as unimodality are exploited. The algorithm localizes
targets based on the rotated eigenstructure of a reconstructed observation
matrix. In particular, the optimal rotation can be found by maximizing the
ratio of the dominant singular value of the observation matrix over the nuclear
norm of the optimally rotated observation matrix. It is shown that this ratio
has a unique local maximum leading to computationally efficient search
algorithms. Moreover, analytical results are developed to show that the squared
localization error decreases at a rate faster than the baseline scheme.

designed around key poses to control various tasks on a humanoid robot. We
present extensive experimental results on a hydraulic, torque controlled

pattern of distances is the result of a self-organizing system. The positive
feedback mechanism that operates a self-organizing system is accomplished by
harmonic orbit resonances, leading to long-term stable planet and moon orbits
in solar or stellar systems. The distance pattern of planets was originally
described by the empirical Titius-Bode law, and by a generalized version with a
constant geometric progression factor (corresponding to logarithmic spacing).
We find that the orbital periods $T_i$ and planet distances $R_i$ from the Sun
are not consistent with logarithmic spacing, but rather follow the quantized
scaling $(R_{i+1}/R_i) = (T_{i+1}/T_i)^{2/3} = (H_{i+1}/H_i)^{2/3}$, where the
harmonic ratios are given by five dominant resonances, namely $(H_{i+1} :
H_{i}) = (3:2), (5:3), (2:1), (5:2), (3:1)$. We find that the orbital period
ratios tend to follow the quantized harmonic ratios in increasing order. We
apply this harmonic orbit resonance model to the planets and moons in our solar
system, and to the exo-planets of 55 Cnc and HD 10180 planetary systems. The
model allows us a prediction of missing planets in each planetary system, based
on the quasi-regular self-organizing pattern of harmonic orbit resonance zones.
We predict 7 (and 4) missing exo-planets around the star 55 Cnc (and HD 10180).
The accuracy of the predicted planet and moon distances amounts to a few
percents. All analyzed systems are found to have $\approx 10$ resonant zones
that can be occupied with planets (or moons) in long-term stable orbits.

increased importance of and demand for reliable multicast. In this paper, we
turn to software-defined networking and develop a novel general-purpose
multi-failure protection algorithm to provide quick failure recovery, via Fast
Failover (FF) groups, for dynamic multicast groups. This extends previous
research, which either could not realize fast failover, worked only for single
link failures, or was only applicable to static multicast groups. However,
while FF is know to be fast, it requires pre-installing back-up rules. These
additional memory requirements, which in a multicast setting are even more
pronounced than for unicast, are often mentioned as a big disadvantage of using
FF.
  We develop an OpenFlow application for resilient multicast, with which we
study FF resource usage, in an attempt to better understand the trade-off
between recovery time and resource usage. Our tests on a realistic network
suggest that using FF groups can reduce the recovery time of the network
significantly compared to other methods, especially when the latency between
the controller and the switches is relatively large.

series, we employ bulge+disc decompositions of realistic dust-free galaxy
images from the Illustris simulation in a consistent comparison with galaxies
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Examining the size-luminosity
relations of each sample, we find that galaxies in Illustris are roughly twice
as large and $0.7$ magnitudes brighter on average than galaxies in the SDSS.
The trend of increasing slope and decreasing normalization of size-luminosity
as a function of bulge-fraction is qualitatively similar to observations.
However, the size-luminosity relations of Illustris galaxies are quantitatively
distinguished by higher normalizations and smaller slopes than for real
galaxies. We show that this result is linked to a significant deficit of
bulge-dominated galaxies in Illustris relative to the SDSS at stellar masses
$\log\mathrm{M}_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\lesssim11$. We investigate this
deficit by comparing bulge fraction estimates derived from photometry
\emph{and} internal kinematics. We show that photometric bulge fractions are
systematically lower than the kinematic fractions at low masses, but with
increasingly good agreement as the stellar mass increases.

The calculations are made using a modified version of the GADGET-2 code that
employs an improved scheme for the artificial viscosity and power-law
dependences of $n$ and $h$ on $N$, as was recently proposed by Zhu et al.,
which comply with the combined limit $N\to\infty$, $h\to 0$, and $n\to\infty$
with $n/N\to 0$ for full SPH consistency, as the domain resolution is
increased. We apply this realization to the ""standard isothermal test case"" in
the variant calculated by Burkert & Bodenheimer and the Gaussian cloud model of
Boss to investigate the response of the method to adaptive smoothing lengths in
the presence of large density and pressure gradients. The degree of consistency
is measured by tracking how well the estimates of the consistency integral
relations reproduce their continuous counterparts. In particular, $C^{0}$ and
$C^{1}$ particle consistency is demonstrated, meaning that the calculations are
close to second-order accuracy. As long as $n$ is increased with $N$, mass
resolution also improves as the minimum resolvable mass $M_{\rm min}\sim
n^{-1}$. This aspect allows proper calculation of small-scale structures in the
flow associated with the formation and instability of protostellar disks around

stressed that the model, which stems from the universal property of

it is shown, in particular, that the requirement of factorization introduces a
severe constraint on the values of k_{rel} and K_{c.m.} that appear in the

the model spectral function and momentum distributions with the ones resulting
from ab-initio calculations performed with realistic local NN interaction of
the Argonne family. It is shown that when the constraint on the value of

into account, the convolution model is in good agreement with the ab-initio
spectral function in the region of the peak exhibited by the latter, whereas
far from the peak, particularly at high values of the removal energy, the model
spectral function can be qualitatively reconciled with the ab-initio spectral

are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some cases, black
defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be
incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several
techniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we
reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is
to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed
to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of
fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above
race-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained
algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The
unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one
important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same
standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and
unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving
public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By
examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be
large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but
the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision
makers carrying out structured decision rules.

eliminating renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities for perturbative QCD
predictions. The PMC uses the renormalization group equation to fix the
$\beta$-pattern of each order in an arbitrary pQCD approximant, and it then
determines the optimal renormalization scale by absorbing all $\{\beta_{i}\}$
terms into the running coupling at each order. The resulting coefficients of
the pQCD series match the scheme-independent conformal series with $\beta=0$.
As in QED, different renormalization scales appear at each order; we call this
the multi-scale approach. In this paper, we present a novel single-scale
approach for the PMC, in which a single effective scale is constructed to
eliminate all non-conformal $\beta$-terms up to a given order simultaneously.
The PMC single-scale approach inherits the main features of the multi-scale
approach; for example, its predictions are scheme-independent, and the pQCD
convergence is greatly improved due to the elimination of divergent renormalon
terms. As an application of the single-scale approach, we investigate the
$e^+e^-$ annihilation cross-section ratio $R_{e^+e^-}$ and the Higgs
decay-width $\Gamma(H \to b \bar{b})$, including four-loop QCD contributions.
The resulting predictions are nearly identical to the multi-scale predictions
for both the total and differential contributions. Thus in many cases, the PMC
single-scale approach PMC-s, which requires a simpler analysis, could be
adopted as a reliable substitution for the PMC multi-scale approach for setting
the renormalization scale for high-energy processes, particularly when one does
not need detailed information at each order. The elimination of the
renormalization scale uncertainty increases the precision of tests of the
Standard Model at the LHC.

entropy in the true causal direction.
  This framework requires the solution of a minimum entropy coupling problem:
Given marginal distributions of m discrete random variables, each on n states,
find the joint distribution with minimum entropy, that respects the given
marginals. This corresponds to minimizing a concave function of nm variables
over a convex polytope defined by nm linear constraints, called a
transportation polytope. Unfortunately, it was recently shown that this minimum
entropy coupling problem is NP-hard, even for 2 variables with n states. Even
representing points (joint distributions) over this space can require
exponential complexity (in n, m) if done naively.

approximate solution for this problem. In this paper we analyze this algorithm
and establish two results: that our algorithm always finds a local minimum and
also is within an additive approximation error from the unknown global optimum.

consistent with isotropic, uniform outflow from the nucleus, with no evidence

studied first on four known states, including two product states and two
maximally entangled Bell states. Next, to evaluate the preservation capacity of
the NUDD scheme, we apply it to eight randomly generated states in the

trajectories may be very strongly convergent in phase space over extremely long

realistic model for small bodies in a turbulent flow). We establish that this
strong convergence is a multi-facetted phenomenon, in which the clustering is
intense, widespread and balanced by lacunarity of other regions. Power laws,
indicative of scale-free features, characterise the distribution of particles
in the system. We use large-deviation and extreme-value statistics to explain
the effect. Our results show that the interpretation of the 'butterfly effect'
needs to be carefully qualified. We argue that the combination of mixing and

implies the existence of conditions for which uncertainties are unexpectedly

rather unique feature that the Cu2+ ions of CuAl2O4 sit at a tetrahedral
position, not like the usual octahedral position for many oxides. At low
temperatures, it exhibits all the thermodynamic evidence of a quantum spin
glass. For example, the polycrystalline CuAl2O4 shows a cusp centered at ~2 K
in the low-field dc magnetization data and a clear frequency dependence in the
ac magnetic susceptibility while it displays logarithmic relaxation behavior in
a time dependence of the magnetization. At the same time, there is a peak at
~2.3 K in the heat capacity, which shifts towards higher temperature with
magnetic fields. On the other hand, there is no evidence of new superlattice
peaks in the high-resolution neutron powder diffraction data when cooled from
40 to 0.4 K. This implies that there is no long-ranged magnetic order down to
0.4 K, thus confirming a spin glass-like ground state for CuAl2O4.
Interestingly, there is no sign of structural distortion either although Cu2+
is a Jahn-Teller active ion. Thus, we claim that an orbital liquid state is the
most likely ground state in CuAl2O4. Of further interest, it also exhibits a
large frustration parameter, f = Theta_CW/Tm ~67, one of the largest values
reported for spinel oxides. Our observations suggest that CuAl2O4 should be a
rare example of a frustrated quantum spin glass with a good candidate for an
orbital liquid state.

effective superconducting gap. We find Majorana mode energy along the
ferromagnet/superconductor interface to sensitively depend on the magnitude of
magnetization $m_{zfs}$ from superconductor region, and its slope around
perpendicular incidence is steep with very low dependency on $m_{zfs}$. The

Andreev bound state in

noticeable impact on the gap opening in Andreev bound state, which occurs in
finite angle of incidence. This directly results in zero-energy Andreev state
being dominant. By introducing the proper form of corresponding Dirac spinors

averaging of its neighboring pixels, where the weights are computed using image
patches. We demonstrate that the denoising performance of NLM can be improved
by pruning the neighboring pixels, namely, by rejecting neighboring pixels
whose weights are below a certain threshold $\lambda$. While pruning can
potentially reduce pixel averaging in uniform-intensity regions, we demonstrate
that there is generally an overall improvement in the denoising performance. In
particular, the improvement comes from pixels situated close to edges and
corners. The success of the proposed method strongly depends on the choice of
the global threshold $\lambda$, which in turn depends on the noise level and
the image characteristics. We show how Stein's unbiased estimator of the
mean-squared error can be used to optimally tune $\lambda$, at a marginal
computational overhead. We present some representative denoising results to
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over NLM and its
variants.

and unknown fixed-effects parameter $\mu$. Their dynamics differ by the

covariate information, different initial conditions and observation times and
duration. The distribution of $\phi^i$ is parametrized by an unknown
$\vartheta$ and $\theta = (\mu, \vartheta)$ is the target of statistical
inference. Its maximum likelihood estimator is derived from the continuous-time
likelihood. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of $\hat{\theta}_N$

and electric energies, and the conversion efficiency is determined by a figure
of merit zT. Up to date, two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) related TE
materials hold the records for zT near room-temperature. A sharp increase in zT
up to ~2.0 was observed previously for superlattice materials such as PbSeTe,
Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 and SrNb0.2Ti0.8O3/SrTiO3, when the thicknesses of these TE
materials were spatially confine within sub-nanometre scale. The
two-dimensional confinement of carriers enlarges the density of states near the
Fermi energy3-6 and triggers electron phonon coupling. This overcomes the
conventional {\sigma}-S trade-off to more independently improve S, and thereby
further increases thermoelectric power factors (PF=S2{\sigma}). Nevertheless,
practical applications of the present 2DEG materials for high power energy
conversions are impeded by the prerequisite of spatial confinement, as the
amount of TE material is insufficient. Here, we report similar TE properties to
2DEGs but achieved in SrNb0.2Ti0.8O3 films with thickness within sub-micrometer
scale by regulating interfacial and lattice polarizations. High power factor
(up to 103 {\mu}Wcm-1K-2) and zT value (up to 1.6) were observed for the film
materials near room-temperature and below. Even reckon in the thickness of the

be 102 {\mu}Wcm-1K-2 was achieved in a 2 {\mu}m-thick SrNb0.2Ti0.8O3 film grown
on a 100 {\mu}m-thick SrTiO3 substrate. The dependence of high TE performances
on size-confinement is reduced by ~103 compared to the conventional

due to their inherent complexity such as clustering of images and natural
language processing. Humans can provide more insightful information for these
difficult problems compared to machine-based automatic techniques.
Nevertheless, human workers can make mistakes due to lack of domain expertise
or seriousness, ambiguity, or even due to malicious intents. The
state-of-the-art literature usually deals with human errors via majority voting
or by assigning a universal error rate over crowd workers. However, such
approaches are incomplete, and often inconsistent, because the expertise of
crowd workers are diverse with possible biases, thereby making it largely
inappropriate to assume a universal error rate for all workers over all
crowdsourcing tasks.
  To this end, we mitigate the above challenges by considering an uncertain
graph model, where the edge probability between two records A and B denotes the
ratio of crowd workers who voted Yes on the question if A and B are same
entity. In order to reflect independence across different crowdsourcing tasks,
we apply the well-established notion of possible worlds, and develop
parameter-free algorithms both for next crowdsourcing, as well as for entity
resolution problems. In particular, using our framework, the problem of entity
resolution becomes equivalent to finding the maximum-likelihood clustering;
whereas for the next crowdsourcing, we identify the record pair that maximally
increases the reliability of the maximum-likelihood clustering. Based on
detailed empirical analysis over real-world datasets, we find that our proposed
solution, PERC (probabilistic entity resolution with imperfect crowd) improves
the quality by 15% and reduces the overall cost by 50% for the
crowdsourcing-based entity resolution problem.

dimensionality reduction techniques (Pearson, 1901; Tipping & Bishop, 1999) to
embed high-dimensional datasets in a lower-dimensional space, and plot the data
using a simple (yet powerful) API with many options for data manipulation [e.g.
hyperalignment (Haxby et al., 2011), clustering, normalizing, etc.] and plot
styling. The toolbox is designed around the notion of data trajectories and
point clouds. Just as the position of an object moving through space can be
visualized as a 3D trajectory, HyperTools uses dimensionality reduction
algorithms to create similar 2D and 3D trajectories for time series of
high-dimensional observations. The trajectories may be plotted as interactive
static plots or visualized as animations. These same dimensionality reduction
and alignment algorithms can also reveal structure in static datasets (e.g.
collections of observations or attributes). We present several examples
showcasing how using our toolbox to explore data through trajectories and
low-dimensional embeddings can reveal deep insights into datasets across a wide

Body Area Networks (WBANs). Increasing the transmission power of WBAN's nodes
improves the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), and hence
decreases the bit error probability. However, this increase may impose
interference on nodes within the same WBAN or on other nodes of nearby
coexisting WBANs, as these WBANs may use similar frequencies. Due to co-channel
interference, packet collisions and retransmissions are increased and
consequently, the power consumption of the individual WBANs may increase
correspondingly. To address this problem, we adopt the approach of two-hop
cooperative communication due to its efficiency in power savings. In this
paper, we propose a cooperative power control-based algorithm, namely, IMA, for
interference mitigation among the individual sensors of a single WBAN.
Basically, our approach selects an optimal set of relays from the nodes within
each WBAN to mitigate the interference. Thus, IMA selection criterion relies on
the best channel, namely, SINR and power conditions to select the set of best
relays. The experimental results illustrate that IMA improves the SINR, the
power efficiency and extends WBAN lifetime. In addition, the results illustrate
that IMA lowers the bit error probability and improves the throughput.

Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH) encountered in previous work when applying it to
Giant Impacts. First we introduce a novel method to obtain accurate SPH
representations of a planet's equilibrium initial conditions based on equal
area tessellations of the sphere. This allows one to imprint an arbitrary
density and internal energy profile with very low noise which substantially
reduces computation because these models require no relaxation prior to use. As
a consequence one can significantly increase the resolution and more flexibly
change the initial bodies to explore larger parts of the impact parameter space
in simulations. The second issue addressed is the proper treatment of the
matter/vacuum boundary at a planet's surface with a modified SPH density
estimator that properly calculates the density stabilizing the models and
avoiding an artificially low density atmosphere prior to impact. Further we
present a novel SPH scheme that simultaneously conserves both energy and
entropy for an arbitrary equation of state. This prevents loss of entropy
during the simulation and further assures that the material does not evolve
into unphysical states. Application of these modifications to impact
simulations for different resolutions up to $6.4 \cdot 10^6$ particles show a
general agreement with prior result. However, we observe resolution dependent
differences in the evolution and composition of post collision ejecta. This
strongly suggests that the use of more sophisticated equations of state also
demands a large number of particles in such simulations.

native hydrocarbons is in the focus of scientific and industrial interests
since many years. We describe electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) of
crude oil from the well without any additional sample treatment (i.e., in the
native environment) in the magnetic field of about 3.4 T and temperature of 50
K by applying microwave pulses at 94 GHz (W-band) and radiofrequency pulses at
near the proton Larmor frequencies of 144 MHz to probe the paramagnetic
vanadyls. By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ENDOR
features are explained and ascribed to certain vanadyl porhyrin structural
forms known to be present in crude oil.

  trajectories using genetic algorithms","32 pages, 16 figures, Accepted for publication in Acta Astronautica",,"10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.01.033",,"physics.space-ph astro-ph.GA astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A vast wealth of literature exists on the topic of rocket trajectory
optimisation, particularly in the area of interplanetary trajectories due to
its relevance today. Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic
trajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical
approach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a
general relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration
rockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a
genetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel
required for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion
systems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the
Milky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on
board, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum
technological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light
years away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several
hundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time
dilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit
times are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low
acceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of
1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable
time frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for
now, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be
possible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion
technology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel
remains to be determined.

non-interacting two-level atoms. Two methods are used to calculate the
probability of the large fluctuations and the time dependence of the excitation
and emission. The first method is based on the large deviation principle for
Markov processes. The second one uses an analogue of the quantum formalism for
classical probability problems. Particularly we prove that in a large
fluctuation limit approximately a half of the atoms are excited. This fact is
independent on the fraction of the excited atoms in the stationary state.

Additional insight is also given by analyzing the properties of the operators

The outcomes fully agree with the results recently achieved by Edfors, Craeye,
