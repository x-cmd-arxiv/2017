based on purely non-parametric considerations, i.e., based on the empirical CFs

This approach can be, however, naturally generalized to a more complex
semi-parametric modeling approach, e.g., by incorporating the generalized
Pareto distribution fit of the severity distribution heavy tails, and/or by
considering the weighted mixture of the parametric CFs (used to model the
expert knowledge) and the empirical CFs (used to incorporate the knowledge
based on the historical data - internal and/or external). Here we present a
simple and yet efficient method and algorithms for numerical inversion of the
CF, suitable for evaluation of the ALDs and the associated measures of interest
important for applications, as, e.g., the value at risk (VaR). The presented
approach is based on combination of the Gil-Pelaez inversion formulae for
deriving the probability distribution (PDF and CDF) from the compound
(empirical) CF and the trapezoidal rule used for numerical integration. The
applicability of the suggested approach is illustrated by analysis of a well

physical in the sense that the solution will bring new physics, i.e. new
testable predictions, hence it is not merely a matter of interpretation of a
frozen formalism. I argue that the two popular ways around the measurement
problem, many-worlds and Bohmian-like mechanics, do, de facto, introduce
effective collapses when ""I"" interact with the quantum system. Hence,
surprisingly, in many-worlds and Bohmian mechanics, the ""I"" plays a more active

that either there are several kinds of stuffs out there, i.e. physical dualism,
some stuff that respects the superposition principle and some that doesn't, or
there are special configurations of atoms and photons for which the
superposition principle breaks down. Or, and this I argue is the most
promising, the dynamics has to be modified, i.e. in the form of a stochastic
Schr\""odinger equation.

Synergistic effects lead to improved therapeutic outcomes, whereas,
antagonistic effects can be life-threatening, may lead to increased healthcare
cost, or may even cause death. Thus identification of unknown drug-drug
interaction (DDI) is an important concern for efficient and effective
healthcare. Although multiple resources for DDI exist, they are often unable to
keep pace with rich amount of information available in fast growing biomedical
texts. Most existing methods model DDI extraction from text as a classification
problem and mainly rely on handcrafted features. Some of these features further
depend on domain specific tools. Recently neural network models using latent
features have been shown to give similar or better performance than the other
existing models dependent on handcrafted features. In this paper, we present
three models namely, {\it B-LSTM}, {\it AB-LSTM} and {\it Joint AB-LSTM} based
on long short-term memory (LSTM) network. All three models utilize word and
position embedding as latent features and thus do not rely on explicit feature
engineering. Further use of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)
networks allow implicit feature extraction from the whole sentence. The two
models, {\it AB-LSTM} and {\it Joint AB-LSTM} also use attentive pooling in the
output of Bi-LSTM layer to assign weights to features. Our experimental results
on the SemEval-2013 DDI extraction dataset show that the {\it Joint AB-LSTM}
model outperforms all the existing methods, including those relying on
handcrafted features. The other two proposed LSTM models also perform
competitively with state-of-the-art methods.

challenging is the interplay between goals that agents are pursuing and the

consists of plans that maximise the overall utility, each of which can be

artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification
of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment,
heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing
long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from
UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important
protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning
algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also
for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with
similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease,
ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained
RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only
candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated
sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering
function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ
significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot
be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and
experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning
approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of
homologues for a wide range of protein functions.

framework of grand unification when the loop particles comprise scalar
leptoquarks (LQs) and quarks of the matching electric charge. This mechanism
can be implemented in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models and
requires the presence of at least one LQ pair. The appropriate pairs for the
neutrino mass generation via the up-type and down-type quark loops are
$S_3$-$R_2$ and $S_{1,\,3}$-$\tilde{R}_2$, respectively. We consider two
phenomenologically distinct regimes for the LQ masses in our analysis. First
regime calls for very heavy LQs in the loop. It can be naturally realised with
the $S_{1,\,3}$-$\tilde{R}_2$ scenarios when the LQ masses are roughly between
$10^{12}$ GeV and $5 \times 10^{13}$ GeV. These lower and upper bounds
originate from experimental limits on partial proton decay lifetimes and
perturbativity constraints, respectively. Second regime corresponds to the
collider accessible LQs in the neutrino mass loop. That option is viable for
the $S_3$-$\tilde{R}_2$ scenario in the models of unification that we discuss.
If one furthermore assumes the presence of the type II see-saw mechanism there
is an additional contribution from the $S_3$-$R_2$ scenario that needs to be
taken into account beside the type II see-saw contribution itself. We provide a
complete list of renormalizable operators that yield necessary mixing of all
aforementioned LQ pairs using the language of $SU(5)$. We furthermore discuss
several possible embeddings of this mechanism in $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ gauge

  Version with Detailed Proofs)",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Handling interference is one of the main challenges in the design of wireless
networks. In this paper we study the application of cooperation for
interference management in the weak interference (WI) regime, focusing on the
Z-interference channel with a causal relay (Z-ICR), when the channel
coefficients are subject to ergodic phase fading, all transmission powers are
finite, and the relay is full-duplex. In order to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the benefits of cooperation in the WI regime, we characterize,
for the first time, two major performance measures for the ergodic phase fading
Z-ICR in the WI regime: The sum-rate capacity and the maximal generalized
degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In the capacity analysis, we obtain conditions on
the channel coefficients, subject to which the sum-rate capacity of the ergodic
phase fading Z-ICR is achieved by treating interference as noise at each
receiver, and explicitly state the corresponding sum-rate capacity. In the GDoF
analysis, we derive conditions on the exponents of the magnitudes of the
channel coefficients, under which treating interference as noise achieves the
maximal GDoF, which is explicitly characterized as well. It is shown that under
certain conditions on the channel coefficients, {\em relaying strictly
increases} both the sum-rate capacity and the maximal GDoF of the ergodic phase
fading Z-interference channel in the WI regime. Our results demonstrate {\em
for the first time} the gains from relaying in the presence of interference,
{\em when interference is weak and the relay power is finite}, both in

promising technique to handle the challenge of partial faces is to design face

namely, SegFace and DeepSegFace, are proposed that detect the presence of a
face given arbitrary combinations of certain face segments. Both methods use
proposals from facial segments as input that are found using weak boosted
classifiers. SegFace is a shallow and fast algorithm using traditional
features, tailored for situations where real time constraints must be
satisfied. On the other hand, DeepSegFace is a more powerful algorithm based on
a deep convolutional neutral network (DCNN) architecture. DeepSegFace offers
certain advantages over other DCNN-based face detectors as it requires
relatively little amount of data to train by utilizing a novel data
augmentation scheme and is very robust to occlusion by design. Extensive
experiments show the superiority of the proposed methods, specially
DeepSegFace, over other state-of-the-art face detectors in terms of
precision-recall and ROC curve on two mobile face datasets.

First, it includes a systematic method to determine the encoding regions in the

applied to various storage devices, to various dimensions (i.e, number of

surface and momentum dependency of $f$-wave pair potential, monolayer $MoS_2$
with strong spin-orbit coupling can be considered an intriguing structure to
reveal the superconducting state. Actually, this can be possible by calculating
the peculiar spin-valley polarized transport of quasiparticles in a related
normal metal/superconductor junction. We theoretically study the formation of
effective gap at the interface and resulting normalized conductance on top of a
$MoS_2$ under induction of $f$-wave order parameter, using
Bloder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism. The superconducting excitations shows that
the gap is renormalized by a \textit{bias limitation} coefficient including
dynamical band parameters of monolayer $MoS_2$, especially, ones related to the
Schrodinger-type momentum of Hamiltonian. The effective gap is more sensitive
to the n-doping regime of superconductor region. The signature of spin-orbit
coupling, topological and asymmetry mass-related terms in the resulting subgap
conductance and, in particular, maximum conductance is presented. In the
absence of topological term, the effective gap reaches to its maximum value.
The unconventional nature of superconducting order leads to the appearance of

these changes in absorption at two photon energies along this spectrum, and

using graphical processing units (GPUs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
to exemplarily report about our experience with a highly accelerated
implementation of the non-linear inversion algorithm (NLINV) for dynamic MRI
with high frame rates. Methods: The NLINV algorithm is optimized and ported to
run on an a multi-GPU single-node server. The algorithm is mapped to multiple
GPUs by decomposing the data domain along the channel dimension. Furthermore,
the algorithm is decomposed along the temporal domain by relaxing a temporal
regularization constraint, allowing the algorithm to work on multiple frames in
parallel. Finally, an autotuning method is presented that is capable of
combining different decomposition variants to achieve optimal algorithm
performance in different imaging scenarios. Results: The algorithm is
successfully ported to a multi-GPU system and allows online image

cost effective if it is adjacent to more vertices in V\S than in S. A
bipartition Pi = {S, V\S} is called very cost effective if both S and V\S are
very cost effective sets [5,6]. In this paper, we investigate the very cost

researches. Recently, a large number of encryption algorithms has been
presented to protect image contents.The main objective of modern image
encryption schemes is to reduce the computation complexity in order to respond
to the real time multimedia and/or limited resources requirements without
degrading the high level of security. In fact, most of the recent solutions are
based on the chaotic theory. However, the majority of chaotic systems suffers
from different limitations and their implementation is difficult at the
hardware level because of the non integer operations that are employed
requiring huge resources and latency. In this paper, we analyze the new
chaos-based image encryption system presented in~\cite{el2016new}. It uses a
static binary diffusion layer, followed by a key dependent bit-permutation
layer that only iterates for one round. Based on their results in this paper,
we claim that the uniformity and avalanche effect can be reached from the first
round. However, we tried to verify the results but our conclusion was that
these results were wrong because it was shown that at least 6 iterations are
necessary to ensure the required cryptographic performance such as the
plain-sensitivity property. Therefore, the required execution time must be
multiplied by 6 and consequently this will increase the latency. In addition to
all aforementioned problems, we find that ensuring the avalanche effect in the
whole image introduces a high error propagation. In order to solve this
problem, we recommend to ensure the avalanche effect in the level of blocks
instead of the whole image.

algorithms are not perfect, and accordingly the provided output might be noisy,
inaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, a forged image in practical
scenarios is often the result of utilizing several tools available by
image-processing software systems. Therefore, reliable tamper detection
requires developing more poweful tools to deal with various tempering
scenarios. Fusion of forgery detection tools based on Fuzzy Inference System
has been used before for addressing this problem. Adjusting the membership
functions and defining proper fuzzy rules for attaining to better results are
time-consuming processes. This can be accounted as main disadvantage of fuzzy

achieved this by developing the first inverse Helmholtz Solver (iHS), which
implicitly reconstructs the complex acoustic waveform--at a given frequency--up

impedance as a result of the calculation for that given frequency. We show that
the algebraic closure conditions required by the inverse Helmholtz problem are

parallelizable over the frequency domain allowing for the straightforward
determination of the full broadband impedance at every point of the target
boundary. In this paper, we restrict our analysis to two-dimensions only. We
