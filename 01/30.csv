leveraging on facial attributes based supervision. We observe a phenomenon that
part detectors emerge within CNN trained to classify attributes from uncropped
face images, without any explicit part supervision. The observation motivates a
new method for finding faces through scoring facial parts responses by their
spatial structure and arrangement. The scoring mechanism is data-driven, and
carefully formulated considering challenging cases where faces are only
partially visible. This consideration allows our network to detect faces under
severe occlusion and unconstrained pose variations. Our method achieves
promising performance on popular benchmarks including FDDB, PASCAL Faces, AFW,

works. In this numerical study, we analyse full-order, optimal controllers for
large dynamical systems in presence of multiple actuators and sensors. We start
from the original technique proposed by Bewley et al. (2016), the adjoint of
the direct-adjoint (ADA) algorithm. The algorithm is iterative and allows
bypassing the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation associated with the
optimal control problems, typically unfeasible for large systems.
  We extend ADA into a more generalized framework that includes the design of
multi-input, coupled controllers and robust controllers based on the H_{\infty}
framework. The full-order controllers do not require any preliminary step of
model reduction or low-order approximation: this feature allows to pre-assess
the optimal performances of an actuated flow without relying on any estimation
process or further hypothesis.
  We show that the algorithm outperforms analogous technique, in terms of
convergence performances considering two numerical cases: a distributed system
and the linearized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, mimicking a full
three-dimensional control setup. For the ADA algorithm we find excellent
scalability with the number of inputs (actuators) in terms of convergence to
the solution, making the method a viable way for full-order controller design
in complex settings.

making it a powerful tool for analyzing structures of macromolecular complexes

structural complexity together with practical imaging limitations make the
systematic de novo discovery of structures within cells challenging. It would
likely require averaging and classifying millions of subtomograms potentially
containing hundreds of highly heterogeneous structural classes. Although it is
no longer difficult to acquire CECT data containing such amount of subtomograms
due to advances in data acquisition automation, existing computational
approaches have very limited scalability or discrimination ability, making them
incapable of processing such amount of data.
  Results: To complement existing approaches, in this paper we propose a new
approach for subdividing subtomograms into smaller but relatively homogeneous
subsets. The structures in these subsets can then be separately recovered using
existing computation intensive methods. Our approach is based on supervised
structural feature extraction using deep learning, in combination with
unsupervised clustering and reference-free classification. Our experiments show
that, compared to existing unsupervised rotation invariant feature and
pose-normalization based approaches, our new approach achieves significant
improvements in both discrimination ability and scalability. More importantly,
our new approach is able to discover new structural classes and recover
structures that do not exist in training data.

interaction rates of heavy nuclei during the core collapse of massive stars.
The nuclear abundances in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) are calculated
by some equation of state (EOS) models including in-medium effects on nuclear
masses. We systematically examine the sensitivities of electron capture and
neutrino-nucleus scattering on heavy nuclei to the nuclear shell effects and
the single nucleus approximation. We find that the washout of shell effects at
high temperatures brings significant change to weak rates by smoothing the
nuclear abundance distribution: the electron capture rate decreases by
$\sim$20$\%$ in the early phase and increases by $\sim$40$\%$ in the late phase
at most, while the cross section for neutrino-nucleus scattering is reduced by
$\sim$15$\%$. This is because the open-shell nuclei become abundant instead of
those with closed neutron shells as the shell effects disappear. We also find
that the single-nucleus description based on the average values leads to
underestimations of weak rates. Electron captures and neutrino coherent
scattering on heavy nuclei are reduced by $\sim$80$\%$ in the early phase and
by $\sim$5$\%$ in the late phase, respectively. These results indicate that NSE
like EOS accounting for shell washout is indispensable for the reliable
estimation of weak interaction rates in simulations of core-collapse
supernovae.

particle is reviewed in terms of the Chern number. Within the continuum limit,
a half-quantized Hall conductivity is obtained. Thereafter, by considering the
lattice regularization of the Dirac theory, we show how one may obtain the well
known quantum Hall conductivity for a single Dirac cone. The renormalization of
the electron energy spectrum, for both small and large coupling regime, is
derived. In particular, it is shown that massless Dirac particles may, only in
the strong correlated limit, break either chiral or parity symmetries. For
graphene, this implies the generation of Landau-like energy levels and the

angle of attack, $\alpha=14^{\circ{}}$. Flow control is applied via imposition
of complex IBCs using the time-domain implementation developed by Scalo,
Bodart, and Lele, $\textit{Phys. Fluids} $(2015). Separation is delayed due to
the enhanced mixing associated with convectively amplified spanwise-oriented
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers, generated via hydro-acoustic instabilities. The
latter are the result of the interaction of the wall-normal transpiration
through the impedance panel and the overlying mean background shear. The result
is an alteration of the coupled instability between the separating shear layer
and the vortex shedding in the wake (already present in the uncontrolled
baseline flow) yielding unique wake topologies associated with different
intensities for the passively generated KH vortical structures. Specifically,
enhancements up to +13\% in the lift coefficients have been obtained. Results
show that tuning of the resonant cavities below the natural shedding frequency
is required to generate KH rollers structures with a sufficiently large
entrainment diameter to encompass the full extent of the separated region,
thereby enhancing mixing and promoting reattachment. Overall, the results
presented in this work show that the adoption of hydro-acoustically tuned
resonant panels is a promising passive control technique for boundary layer
separation control.

high dimensional problems. The associated multivariate rank and accordant
tuples of singular values are based on different matricizations of the same
tensor. While the behavior of such is as essential as in the matrix case, here
the question about the $\textit{feasibility}$ of specific constellations
arises: which prescribed tuples can be realized as singular values of a tensor
and what is this feasible set? We first show the equivalence of the
$\textit{tensor feasibility problem (TFP)}$ to the $\textit{quantum marginal
problem (QMP)}$. In higher dimensions, in case of the tensor train (TT-)format,
the conditions for feasibility can be decoupled. By present results for three
dimensions for the QMP, it then follows that the tuples of squared, feasible
TT-singular values form polyhedral cones. We further establish a connection to
eigenvalue relations of sums of Hermitian matrices, which in turn are described
by sets of interlinked, so called $\textit{honeycombs}$, as they have been
introduced by Knutson and Tao. Besides a large class of universal, necessary
inequalities as well as the vertex description for a special, simpler instance,
we present a linear programming algorithm to check feasibility and a simple,
heuristic algorithm to construct representations of tensors with prescribed,
feasible TT-singular values in parallel.

the past, the exponential growth of the Internet was mainly due to semantically
agnostic transport protocols. In the future it is to be expected that, because
of the increasing autonomy of technical systems, it becomes necessary to better
understand the nature of the semantics of these interaction networks to create
appropriate networking applications. Appropriate means that the architecture of
these applications allows to minimize the effort to adapt these applications to
the permanently changing interaction networks.
  The proposed interaction oriented architecture is based on a reference model
of interaction semantics. It provides guiding principles on how to design
networking applications.
  The reference model of interaction semantics provides: a unifying description
of the things in the physical, the information and the human world; an
interaction model that is of direct runtime relevance; an understanding for how
hierarchical structured components can cooperate loosely coupled; a concept to
determine how much semantics has to be common to enable components of different
semantic domains to cooperate loosely coupled; and a data type model.
  The software reference architecture provides: a definition of software
layers; means to express vertical interactions, that is interactions which
demarcate a software layer; means to express horizontal interactions, that is,
between processes in the same software layer; a definition of a component and
how to distinguish it from other entities like systems or objects; and a model
how to separate reusable from non-reusable parts of an application's

millimeter-wave photons have been shown to exhibit high quality factors, making
them highly sensitive and multiplexable. The superconducting gap of aluminum
limits aluminum LEKIDs to photon frequencies above 100 GHz. Manganese-doped
aluminum (Al-Mn) has a tunable critical temperature and could therefore be an
attractive material for LEKIDs sensitive to frequencies below 100 GHz if the
internal quality factor remains sufficiently high when manganese is added to
the film. To investigate, we measured some of the key properties of Al-Mn
LEKIDs. A prototype eight-element LEKID array was fabricated using a 40 nm
thick film of Al-Mn deposited on a 500 {\mu}m thick high-resistivity,
float-zone silicon substrate. The manganese content was 900 ppm, the measured
$T_c = 694\pm1$ mK, and the resonance frequencies were near 150 MHz. Using
measurements of the forward scattering parameter $S_{21}$ at various bath
temperatures between 65 and 250 mK, we determined that the Al-Mn LEKIDs we
fabricated have internal quality factors greater than $2 \times 10^5$, which is
high enough for millimeter-wave astrophysical observations. In the dark
conditions under which these devices were measured, the fractional frequency
noise spectrum shows a shallow slope that depends on bath temperature and probe
tone amplitude, which could be two-level system noise. The anticipated white
photon noise should dominate this level of low-frequency noise when the
detectors are illuminated with millimeter-waves in future measurements. The
LEKIDs responded to light pulses from a 1550 nm light-emitting diode, and we
used these light pulses to determine that the quasiparticle lifetime is 60
{\mu}s.

the fundamental strong interaction (explained in quantum chromo-dynamics) at

tremendous efforts have been tried. This kind of compact objects could actually
be strange quark stars if strange quark matter in bulk may constitute the true
ground state of the strong-interaction matter rather than Fe^56 (the so-called
Witten's conjecture). From astrophysical points of view, however, it is
proposed that strange cluster matter could be absolutely stable and thus those
compact stars could be strange cluster stars in fact. This proposal could be
regarded as a general Witten's conjecture: strange matter in bulk could be
absolutely stable, in which quarks are either free (for strange quark matter)
or localized (for strange cluster matter). Strange cluster with
three-light-flavor symmetry is renamed strangeon, being coined by combining
""strange nucleon"" for the sake of simplicity. A strangeon star can then be
thought as a 3-flavored gigantic nucleus, and strangeons are its constituent as
an analogy of nucleons which are the constituent of a normal (micro) nucleus.
The observational consequences of strangeon stars show that different
manifestations of pulsar-like compact stars could be understood in the regime
of strangeon stars, and we are expecting more evidence for strangeon star by
advanced facilities (e.g., FAST, SKA, and eXTP).

neighbor graph (kNN) is presented. Two major issues have been considered in the
paper. Firstly, an efficient kNN graph construction method based on two means
tree is presented. For the nearest neighbor search, an enhanced hill-climbing
procedure is proposed, which sees considerable performance boost over original
procedure. Furthermore, with the support of inverted indexing derived from
residue vector quantization, our method achieves close to 100% recall with high
speed efficiency in two state-of-the-art evaluation benchmarks. In addition, a
comparative study on both the compressional and traditional nearest neighbor
search methods is presented. We show that our method achieves the best
trade-off between search quality, efficiency and memory complexity.

considers generalized flags which are, generally infinite, chains $\mathcal{C}$
of subspaces in the natural representation $V$ of $G$ which satisfy a certain

largest space in $\mathcal{C}$ which does not contain $v$, and a smallest space
in $\mathcal{C}$ which contains $v$.
  We start with a review of the construction of the ind-varieties of

ind-spaces of the form $G/P$ for splitting parabolic ind-subgroups $P\subset

non-splitting, parabolic ind-subgroups in terms of generalized flags. In the
special case of an ind-grassmannian $X$, we give a purely algebraic-geometric

$G/P$ for arbitrary splitting parabolic ind-subgroups $P\subset G$, as well as

(PDCA) repeatedly evaluates closed-form solutions of convex subproblems,
leading to a stationary point of the $\ell_0$-constrained problem. However,
when the problem has additional convex constraints, they become inefficient
because it is difficult to obtain closed-form solutions of the associated
subproblems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem by employing a new DC
representation of the $\ell_0$-constraint, so that PDCA can retain the
efficiency by reducing its subproblems to the projection operation onto a
convex set. Moreover, inspired by the Nesterov's acceleration technique for
proximal methods, we propose the Accelerated PDCA (APDCA), which attains the
optimal convergence rate if applied to convex programs, and performs well in
numerical experiments.

it provides a significantly better key rate than that from the original

improvements are: use of new TP-AGB tracks and related atmosphere models and
spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in
the isochrone tables, accounting for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up
episodes and hot-bottom burning; inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles,
with a complete description of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters;
new pulsation models to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental

during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer calculations
for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall, these improvements
are expected to lead to a more consistent and detailed description of
properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved stellar populations, especially
in regard to their mean photometric properties from optical to mid-infrared
wavelengths. We illustrate the expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different
types in stellar populations covering a wide range of ages and initial
metallicities, providing further details on the C-star island that appears at
intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the AGB-boosting effect
that occurs at ages close to 1.6 Gyr for populations of all metallicities. The

particles at collisionless shock waves takes place in the cosmic-ray precursor,
through the interaction of accelerated particles with the unshocked plasma.
Detecting directly or indirectly the synchrotron radiation of accelerated
particles in this precursor would open a new window on the microphysics of
acceleration and of collisionless shock waves. We provide analytical estimates
of the spectrum and of the polarization fraction of the synchrotron precursor
for both relativistic and non-relativistic collisionless shock fronts,
accounting for the self-generation or amplification of magnetic turbulence. In
relativistic sources, the spectrum of the precursor is harder than that of the
shocked plasma, because the upstream residence time increases with particle
energy, leading to an effectively hard spectrum of accelerated particles in the
precursor volume. At high frequencies, typically in the optical to X-ray range,
the contribution of the precursor becomes sizeable, but we find that in most
cases studied, it remains dominated by the synchrotron or inverse Compton
contribution of the shocked plasma; its contribution might be detectable only
in trans-relativistic shock waves. Non-relativistic sources offer the
possibility of spectral imaging of the precursor by viewing the shock front
edge-on. We calculate this spectro-morphological contribution for various
parameters. The synchrotron contribution is also sizeable at the highest
frequencies (X-ray range). If the turbulence is tangled in the plane transverse
to the shock front, the resulting synchrotron radiation should be nearly
maximally linearly polarized; polarimetry thus arises as an interesting tool to
reveal this precursor.[Abridged]

known that successor-invariant formulas are more expressive on finite

naturally raises the question whether this increase in expressive power comes
at an extra cost to solve the model-checking problem, that is, the problem to
decide whether a given structure together with some (and hence every) successor

successor-invariance to first-order logic essentially comes at no extra cost

one-dimensional magnon transport, and found to be suppressed significantly as
compared to single crystals at low temperatures. The experimental results can
be explained by a one-dimensional magnon-defect scattering model, provided that
the magnon-grain boundary scattering mean free path in the anisotropic magnetic
structure is smaller than the average length of these nano-layers along the c
axis. The finding suggests low transmission coefficients for magnons across

in a two-dimensional optical lattice. The optical lattice potential manifests
itself in an interplay between an increase in the density of states on the
Fermi surface and the modification of the fermion-fermion interaction
(scattering) amplitude. The density of states is enhanced due to an increase of
the effective mass of atoms. In deep lattices the scattering amplitude is
strongly reduced compared to free space due to a small overlap of wavefunctions
of fermion sitting in the neighboring lattice sites, which suppresses the
p-wave superfluidity. However, for moderate lattice depths the enhancement of
the density of states can compensate the decrease of the scattering amplitude.
Moreover, the lattice setup significantly reduces inelastic collisional losses,
which allows one to get closer to a p-wave Feshbach resonance. This opens
possibilities to obtain the topological $p_x+ip_y$ superfluid phase, especially
in the recently proposed subwavelength lattices. We demonstrate this for the
two-dimensional version of the Kronig-Penney model allowing a transparent
physical analysis.

categories and implemented as reusable micro-benchmarks. Further, we propose
four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks, and that leverage
various dataflow semantics of DSPS. The applications are based on common IoT
patterns for data pre-processing, statistical summarization and predictive
analytics. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT
observations on smart cities and fitness, with peak streams rates that range
from 500 to 10000 messages/sec and diverse frequency distributions. We validate

small but systematic discrepancies only for a range of scales close to the

While many survey papers aim at summarizing the landscape of techniques for

techniques in the literature fit growing requirements in terms of performance

shape and isotropy of the field. The problem of having an incomplete sky in the
calculation and statistical characterization of the derivatives is addressed in
the paper. The analysis confirms the existence of a low variance in the CMB at
large scales, which is also noticeable in the derivatives. Moreover, deviations
from the standard model in the gradient, curvature and the eccentricity tensor
are studied in terms of extreme values on the data. As it is expected, the Cold
Spot is detected as one of the most prominent peaks in terms of curvature, but
additionally, when the information of the temperature and its Laplacian are
combined, another feature with similar probability at the scale of $10^\circ$
is also observed. However, the $p$-value of these two deviations increase above
the $6\%$ when they are referred to the variance calculated from the
theoretical fiducial model, indicating that these deviations can be associated
to the low variance anomaly. Finally, an estimator of the directional
anisotropy for spinorial quantities is introduced, which is applied to the
spinors derived from the field derivatives. An anisotropic direction whose
probability is $<1\%$ is detected in the eccentricity tensor.

albedo map is dominated by a large, circular feature in Vendimia Planitia,
known from HST images (Li et al., 2006), and dotted by smaller bright features
mostly associated with fresh-looking craters. The dominant color variation over
the surface is represented by the presence of ""blue"" material in and around
such craters, which has a negative spectral slope over the visible wavelength
range when compared to average terrain. We also mapped variations of the phase
curve by employing an exponential photometric model, a technique previously
applied to asteroid Vesta (Schr\""oder et al., 2013b). The surface of Ceres
scatters light differently from Vesta in the sense that the ejecta of several
fresh-looking craters may be physically smooth rather than rough. High albedo,
blue color, and physical smoothness all appear to be indicators of youth. The
blue color may result from the desiccation of ejected material that is similar
to the phyllosilicates/water ice mixtures in the experiments of Poch et al.

an initially liquid condition, perhaps as a consequence of impact melting of

measured by Planck in terms of the most prominent peaks on the sky, which, in
particular, are located in the southern galactic hemisphere. Besides these
large-scale features, the well-known Cold Spot anomaly is included in the
analysis. All these peaks would contribute significantly to some of the CMB
large-scale anomalies, as the parity and hemispherical asymmetries, the dipole
modulation, the alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole, or in the
case of the Cold Spot, to the non-Gaussianity of the field. The analysis of the
peaks is performed by using their multipolar profiles, which characterize the
local shape of the peaks in terms of the discrete Fourier transform of the
azimuthal angle. In order to quantify the local anisotropy of the peaks, the
distribution of the phases of the multipolar profiles is studied by using the
Rayleigh random walk methodology. Finally, a direct analysis of the
2-dimensional field around the peaks is performed in order to take into account
the effect of the galactic mask. The results of the analysis conclude that,
once the peak amplitude and its first and second order derivatives at the
centre are conditioned, the rest of the field is compatible with the standard
model. In particular, it is observed that the Cold Spot anomaly is caused by
the large value of curvature at the centre.

of Mn atoms occupying all the three, X, Y and Z sites of X$_2$YZ Heusler

occupancy disorder of Mn atoms is in addition to a local structural disorder
due to size differences between Mn and In atoms which is also present in

with experimental XAFS at the Mn and Ni K edges in

people could not build a continuous and accurate subjective probability world,
but several order concepts, such as small, middle and large probability. People
make decisions based on information, experience, imagination and other things.
All of these things are so huge that people have to prepare some strategies.
That is, people have different strategies when facing to different situations.
The distributions of these things have different decision structures. More
precisely, decision making is a process of simplifying the decision structure.
However, the process of decision structure simplifying is not stuck in a rut,
but through different path when facing problems repeatedly. It is why
preference reversal always happens when making decisions. The most efficient
way to simplify the decision structure is calculating expected value or making
decisions based on one or two dimensions. We also argue that the deliberation
time at least has four parts, which are consist of substitution time, first
order time, second order time and calculation time. Decision structure also can

global error that is of the same order as the local truncation error (as
defined in

In fact, this is true of the entire class of general linear methods. In
practice, this means that the order of the method is typically defined solely
by the order conditions which are derived by studying the local truncation
error. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the local truncation
error and the global error, and develop a methodology which defines the
construction of explicit {\em error inhibiting} block one-step methods
(alternatively written as explicit general linear methods \cite{butcher1993a}).
These {\em error inhibiting schemes} are constructed so that the accumulation
of the local truncation error over time is controlled, which results in a
global error that is one order higher than the local truncation error. In this
work, we delineate how to carefully choose the coefficient matrices so that the
growth of the local truncation error is inhibited. We then use this theoretical
understanding to construct several methods that have higher order global error
than local truncation error, and demonstrate their enhanced order of accuracy
on test cases. These methods demonstrate that the error inhibiting concept is
realizable. Future work will further develop new error inhibiting methods and
will analyze the computational efficiency and linear stability properties of

more compact than in simulations, requiring an extra $\alpha \approx 0.7$
re-scaling of filter sizes. The data reveals an excess ISW-like signal with
$A_{\rm ISW}\approx9$ amplitude at the $\approx2.5\sigma$ significance level,
unlike previous studies that used isolated voids and reported good consistency
with $A_{\rm ISW}=1$. The tension with the Jubilee-based $\Lambda$CDM
predictions is $\sim 2\sigma$, in consistency with independent analyses of
supervoids in Dark Energy Survey data. We show that such a very large
enhancement of the $A_{\rm ISW}$ parameter hints at a possible causal relation
between the CMB Cold Spot and the Eridanus supervoid. The origin of these
findings remains unclear.

observation of Kerr frequency combs operating in the dissipative Kerr soliton
(DKS) regime, along with dispersive wave formation, has provided the means for
fully coherent, broadband Kerr frequency comb generation with engineered
spectral envelope. Here, by carefully optimizing the photonic Damascene
fabrication process, and dispersion engineering of $\mathrm{Si_{3}N_{4}}$
microresonators with $1\,\mathrm{THz}$ free spectral range, we achieve
bandwidths exceeding one octave at low powers ($\mathcal{O}(100\,\mathrm{mW})$)
for pump lasers residing in the telecom C-band ($1.55\,\mathrm{\mu m}$), as
well as for the first time in the O-band ($1.3\,\mathrm{\mu m}$). Equally
important, we find that for THz repetition rate comb states, conventional
criteria applied to identify DKS comb states fail. Investigating the coherence
of generated, octave-spanning Kerr comb states we unambiguously identify DKS
states using a response measurement. This allows to demonstrate octave-spanning
DKS comb states at both pump laser wavelengths of $1.3\mathrm{\,\mu m}$ and
$1.55\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ including the broadest DKS state generated to date,
spanning more than $200\,\mathrm{THz}$ of optical bandwidth. Octave spanning
DKS frequency combs can form essential building blocks for metrology or

in life sciences such as Kerr comb based optical coherence tomography or dual
comb coherent antistokes Raman scattering.

observations of the solar atmosphere to extend the lead time of predicting the
geoeffectiveness of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In order to achieve this,
the magnetic structure of the CME as it leaves the Sun must be known. In this
article we address this issue by developing a method to determine the intrinsic
flux rope type of a CME solely from solar disk observations. We use several
well known proxies for the magnetic helicity sign, the axis orientation, and
the axial magnetic field direction to predict the magnetic structure of the
interplanetary flux rope. We present two case studies: the 2 June 2011 and the
14 June 2012 CMEs. Both of these events erupted from an active region and,
despite having clear in situ counterparts, their eruption characteristics were
relatively complex. The first event was associated with an active region
filament that erupted in two stages, while for the other event the eruption
originated from a relatively high coronal altitude and the source region did
not feature the presence of a filament. Our magnetic helicity sign proxies
include the analysis of magnetic tongues, soft X-ray and/or EUV sigmoids,
coronal arcade skew, filament emission and absorption threads, and filament
rotation. Since the inclination of the post-eruption arcades was not clear, we
use the tilt of the polarity inversion line to determine the flux rope axis
orientation, and coronal dimmings to determine the flux rope footpoints and,
therefore, the direction of the axial magnetic field. The comparison of the
estimated intrinsic flux rope structure to in situ observations at the
Lagrangian point L1 indicated a good agreement with the predictions. Our
results highlight the flux rope type determination techniques that are
particularly useful for active region eruptions, where most geoeffective CMEs
originate.

five very-metal-poor stars (-3<[Fe/H]<-2) in the Milky Way halo to reveal the
origin of light neutron-capture elements. Previous spectroscopic studies have
shown evidence of at least two components in the r-process; one referred to as
the ""main r-process"" and the other as the ""weak r-process,"" which is mainly
responsible for producing heavy and light neutron-capture elements,
respectively. Observational studies of metal-poor stars suggest that there is a
universal pattern in the main r-process, similar to the abundance pattern of
the r-process component of solar-system material. Still, it is uncertain
whether the abundance pattern of the weak r-process shows universality or
diversity, due to the sparseness of measured light neutron-capture elements. We
have detected the key elements, Mo, Ru, and Pd, in five target stars to give an
answer to this question. The abundance patterns of light neutron-capture
elements from Sr to Pd suggest a diversity in the weak r-process. In
particular, scatter in the abundance ratio between Ru and Pd is significant
when the abundance patterns are normalized at Zr. Our results are compared with
the elemental abundances predicted by nucleosynthesis models of supernovae with
parameters such as electron fraction or proto-neutron-star mass, to investigate
sources of such diversity in the abundance patterns of light neutron-capture
elements. This paper presents that the variation in the abundances of observed
stars can be explained with a small range of parameters, which can serve as
constraints on future modeling of supernova models.

inverse gamma distribution, introduced by Sepp\""al\""ainen, is studied in the

ends has been integrated by Thiery and Le Doussal, using coordinate Bethe
Ansatz techniques and an analytic-continuation prescription. The probability
distribution of the free energy has been obtained through the replica method,
even though the moments of the partition sum do not exist at all orders due to
the fat tail in the distribution of Boltzmann weights. To extend this approach
to the polymer with one free end, we argue that the contribution to the
partition sums in the thermodynamic limit is localised on parity-invariant
string states. This situation is analogous to the case of the continuum polymer
with one free end, related to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation with flat
boundary conditions and solved by Le Doussal and Calabrese. The expansion of
the generating function of the partition sum in terms of numbers of strings can
also be transposed to the log-gamma polymer model, with the induced Fredholm
determinant structure. We derive the large-time limit of the rescaled
cumulative distribution function, and relate it to the GOE Tracy--Widom
distribution. The derivation is conjectural in the sense that it assumes
completeness of a family of string states (and expressions of their norms
already used in the fixed-end problem) and extends heuristically the order of
moments of the partition sum to the complex plane.

vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead
to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper
makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor
and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task.
The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated using
qualitative and quantitative results (the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of the
detection precision-recall curve). We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for
peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers. We release a set of manually

the continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method have been recently
proposed. We aim to extend these studies to the case of breakup reactions
measured under complete kinematics or semi-inclusive reactions in which only
the angular or energy distribution of one of the outgoing fragments is
measured. We use the standard CDCC method as well as its extended version with
core excitations (XCDCC), assuming a pseudo-state basis for describing the
projectile states. Two- and three-body observables are computed by projecting
the discrete two-body breakup amplitudes, obtained within these reaction
frameworks, onto two-body scattering states with definite relative momentum of
the outgoing fragments and a definite state of the core nucleus. The presented
method provides a tool to compute double and triple differential cross sections
for outgoing fragments following the breakup of a two-body projectile, and
might be useful to analyze breakup reactions with other deformed weakly-bound
nuclei, for which core excitations are expected to play a role. We have found
that, while dynamical core excitations are important for the proton target at

key properties that make them the main drivers of evolution of star clusters,

massive stars are so hot that they produce most of the ionizing ultraviolet
radiation of galaxies; in fact, the first massive stars helped to re-ionize the
Universe after its Dark Ages. Another important property of massive stars are
the strong stellar winds and outflows they produce. This mass loss, and finally
the explosion of a massive star as a supernova or a gamma-ray burst, provide a
significant input of mechanical and radiative energy into the interstellar
space. These two properties together make massive stars one of the most
important cosmic engines: they trigger the star formation and enrich the
interstellar medium with heavy elements, that ultimately leads to formation of
Earth-like rocky planets and the development of complex life. The study of
massive star winds is thus a truly multidisciplinary field and has a wide

polycrystalline materials. The crystal structure contains layers made up of
lozenge shaped Cr_4 tetramers. Electrical resistivity measurements show the
crystals to be semiconducting, with a temperature dependence consistent with a
band gap of 0.3eV. The magnetic susceptibility exhibits a broad maximum near
300K characteristic of low dimensional magnetic systems. Weak anomalies are
observed in the susceptibility and heat capacity near 55K, and single crystal
neutron diffraction reveals the onset of long range antiferromagnetic order at
this temperature. Strongly dispersive spin-waves are observed in the ordered
state. Significant magneto-elastic coupling is indicated by the anomalous
temperature dependence of the lattice parameters and is apparent in structural
optimization in van der Waals density functional theory calculations for
different magnetic configurations. The cleavability of the compound is apparent
from its handling and is confirmed by first principles calculations, which
predict a cleavage energy 0.5J/m^2, similar to graphite. Based on these
results, CrTe3 is identified as a promising compound for studies of low

the expression of the point spread function of a coronagraphic instrument in

region characterized by the presence of localized excitations (breathers).
While their formation is well understood and it is expected that the asymptotic
configuration comprises a single breather on top of a background, it is not
clear why the dynamics of a multi-breather configuration is essentially frozen.
In order to investigate this question, we introduce simple stochastic models,
characterized by suitable conservation laws. We focus on the role of the
coupling strength between localized excitations and background. In the DNLS
model, higher breathers interact more weakly, as a result of their faster
rotation. In our stochastic models, the strength of the coupling is controlled
directly by an amplitude-dependent parameter. In the case of a power-law
decrease, the associated coarsening process undergoes a slowing down if the
decay rate is larger than a critical value. In the case of an exponential
decrease, a freezing effect is observed that is reminiscent of the scenario
observed in the DNLS. This last regime arises spontaneously when direct energy
diffusion between breathers and background is blocked below a certain
threshold.

emission from MM1 has increased by a factor of 4.0$\pm$0.3 during the
intervening years, and undergone a significant change in morphology. The
continuum emission from the other cluster members (MM2, MM4 and the UCHII
region MM3 = NGC 6334F) has remained constant. Long term single-dish maser
monitoring at HartRAO finds that multiple maser species toward NGC 6334I flared
beginning in early 2015, a few months before our ALMA observation, and some
persist in that state. New ALMA images obtained in 2016 July-August at 1.1 and
0.87 mm confirm the changes with respect to SMA 0.87 mm images from 2008, and
indicate that the (sub)millimeter flaring has continued for at least a year.
The excess continuum emission, centered on the hypercompact HII region MM1B, is
extended and elongated ($1.6"" \times 1.0"" \approx 2100 \times 1300$ au) with
multiple peaks, suggestive of general heating of the surrounding subcomponents
of MM1, some of which may trace clumps in a fragmented disk rather than
separate protostars. In either case, these remarkable increases in maser and
dust emission provide direct observational evidence of a sudden accretion event
in the growth of a massive protostar yielding a sustained luminosity surge by a
factor of $70\pm20$, analogous to the largest events in simulations by Meyer et
al. (2017). This target provides an excellent opportunity to assess the impact
of such a rare event on a protocluster over many years.

  Methods. The cluster sample was processed with the recently introduced
Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis ($\texttt{ASteCA}$) package, which ensures
both an automatized and a fully reproducible treatment, together with a
statistically based analysis of their fundamental parameters and associated
uncertainties. The fundamental parameters determined with this tool for each
cluster, via a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis, are: metallicity, age,
reddening, distance modulus, and total mass.
  Results. We generated an homogeneous catalog of structural and fundamental
parameters for the studied cluster sample, and performed a detailed internal
error analysis along with a thorough comparison with values taken from
twenty-six published articles. We studied the distribution of cluster
fundamental parameters in both Clouds, and obtained their age-metallicity
relationships.
  Conclusions. The $\texttt{ASteCA}$ package can be applied to an unsupervised
determination of fundamental cluster parameters; a task of increasing relevance
as more data becomes available through upcoming surveys.

the interplay of attacks and defenses on various systems involving critical
infrastructure, financial system security, political campaigns, and civil
safeguarding. However, existing security game models typically either assume
additive utility functions, or that the attacker can attack only one target.
Such assumptions lead to tractable analysis, but miss key inherent dependencies
that exist among different targets in current complex networks. In this paper,
we generalize the classical security game models to allow for non-additive
utility functions. We also allow attackers to be able to attack multiple
targets. We examine such a general security game from a theoretical perspective
and provide a unified view. In particular, we show that each security game is
equivalent to a combinatorial optimization problem over a set system
$\varepsilon$, which consists of defender's pure strategy space. The key
technique we use is based on the transformation, projection of a polytope, and
the elipsoid method. This work settles several open questions in security game

an integrated year-by-year representation of both uncertainties and investment

Expansion Planning (DTNEP) have demonstrated that the use of robust
optimization might render this problem computationally tractable for real
systems. This paper intends to consider not only the capacity expansion of
lines, but the construction and/or dismantling of renewable and conventional
generation facilities as well. The Dynamic Transmission Network and Renewable
Generation Expansion Planning (DTNRGEP) problem is formulated as an adaptive
robust optimization problem with three levels. First level minimizes the
investment costs of transmission network and generation expansion planning, the
second level maximizes system operational costs with respect to uncertain
parameters, while the third level minimizes those operational costs with
respect to operational decisions. The method is tested for two cases: i) an
illustrative example based on Garver IEEE system and ii) a case study using the
IEEE 118-bus system. Numerical results from these examples demonstrate that the

the protostellar envelope. For methanol we find two components: (i) a high

10^-3 for CH2DOH, up to two orders of magnitude lower than the values measured

10^-3, in agreement with what found in the L1157-B1 protostellar shock.
Finally, we estimate [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] about 2. The decrease of deuteration in
the Class I source SVS13-A with respect to Class 0 sources can be explained by
gas-phase processes. Alternatively, a lower deuteration could be the effect of
a gradual collapse of less deuterated external shells of the protostellar

transporters on glutamate concentrations in direct vicinity to the synaptic
cleft and by extracellular glutamate. Their relevance for information
representation has been supported by in-vivo studies in ferret and mouse
primary visual cortex. In ferret blocking glutamate transport pharmacologically
broadened tuning curves and enhanced the response at preferred orientation. In
knock-out mice with reduced expression of glutamate transporters sharpened
tuning was observed. It is however unclear how focal and ambient changes in
glutamate concentration affect stimulus representation. Here we develop a
computational framework, which allows the investigation of synaptic and
extrasynaptic effects of glutamate uptake on orientation tuning in recurrently
connected network models with pinwheel-domain (ferret) or salt-and-pepper
(mouse) organization. This model proposed that glutamate uptake shapes
information representation when it affects the contribution of excitatory and
inhibitory neurons to the network activity. Namely, strengthening the
contribution of excitatory neurons generally broadens tuning and elevates the
response. In contrast, strengthening the contribution of inhibitory neurons can
have a sharpening effect on tuning. In addition local representational topology
also plays a role: In the pinwheel-domain model effects were strongest within
domains - regions where neighboring neurons share preferred orientations.
Around pinwheels but also within salt-and-pepper networks the effects were less
strong. Our model proposes that the pharmacological intervention in ferret
increases the contribution of excitatory cells, while the reduced expression in
mouse increases the contribution of inhibitory cells to network activity.

construct unified Dark Matter Dark Energy, where the cosmological constant

measure fields. The Dynamical space time Theories generalize the Two Measure
Theories by introducing a vector field whose equation of motion guarantees the
conservation of a certain Energy Momentum tensor, which may be related, but in
general is not the same as the gravitational Energy Momentum tensor. We propose
two formulations of this idea: I - by demanding that this vector field be the
gradient of a scalar, II - by considering the dynamical space field appearing
in another part of the action. Then the Dynamical space time Theory becomes a
theory of Diffusive Unified Dark Energy and Dark Matter. These generalizations
produce non conserved energy momentum tensors instead of conserved energy
momentum tensors which leads at the end to a formulation of interacting DE-DM
dust models in the form of a diffusive type interacting Unified Dark Energy and
Dark Matter scenario. We solved analytically the theories for perturbative
solution and asymptotic solution, and we show that the $\Lambda$CDM is a fixed

with general linear couplings to two uncorrelated thermal baths at temperatures
$T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. We obtain the complete solution of the
Heisenberg-Langevin equations, which reveal a coherent mixing among the normal
modes of the oscillators as a consequence of their off-diagonal couplings to
the baths. Unique renormalization aspects resulting from this mixing are
discussed. Diagonal and off-diagonal (coherence) correlation functions are
obtained analytically in the case of strictly Ohmic baths with different
couplings in the strong and weak coupling regimes. An asymptotic
non-equilibrium stationary state emerges for which we obtain the complete
expressions for the correlations and coherence. Remarkably the coherence
survives in the high temperature, classical limit for $T_1 \neq T_2$. In the
case of vanishing detuning between the oscillator normal modes both coupling to
one and the same bath the coherence retains memory of the initial conditions at
long time. A perturbative expansion of the early time evolution reveals that
the emergence of coherence is a consequence of the entanglement between the
normal modes of the oscillators \emph{mediated} by their couplings to the
baths. This \emph{suggests} the survival of entanglement in the high
temperature limit for different temperatures of the baths which is essentially
a consequence of the non-equilibrium nature of the asymptotic stationary state.
An out of equilibrium setup with small detuning and large $|T_1- T_2|$ produces
non-vanishing steady-state coherence and entanglement in the high temperature

plane introduced between regular nodes of the staggered Yee grid and inserting
fields determined by GSTCs in this plane in the standard FDTD algorithm. The
resulting update equations are an elegant generalization of the standard FDTD
equations. Indeed, in the limiting case of a null surface susceptibility
($\chi_\text{surf}=0$), they reduce to the latter, while in the next limiting
case of a time-invariant metasurface
$[\chi_\text{surf}\neq\chi_\text{surf}(t)]$, they split in two terms, one
corresponding to the standard equations for a one-cell ($\Delta x$) thick slab
with volume susceptibility ($\chi$), corresponding to a diluted approximation
($\chi=\chi_\text{surf}/(2\Delta x)$) of the zero-thickness target metasurface,
and the other transforming this slab in a real (zero-thickness) metasurface.
The proposed scheme is fully numerical and very easy to implement. Although it
is explicitly derived for a monoisotropic metasurface, it may be
straightforwardly extended to the bianisotropic case. Except for some
particular case, it is not applicable to dispersive metasurfaces, for which an
efficient Auxiliary Different Equation (ADE) extension of the scheme is
currently being developed by the authors. The scheme is validated and
illustrated by five representative examples.

and FP-Growth are among the most common algorithms for frequent itemset mining.
Considerable research has been performed to compare the relative performance
between these three algorithms, by evaluating the scalability of each algorithm
as the dataset size increases. While scalability as data size increases is
important, previous papers have not examined the performance impact of
similarly sized datasets that contain different itemset characteristics. This
paper explores the effects that two dataset characteristics can have on the
performance of these three frequent itemset algorithms. To perform this
empirical analysis, a dataset generator is created to measure the effects of
frequent item density and the maximum transaction size on performance. The
generated datasets contain the same number of rows. This provides some insight
into dataset characteristics that are conducive to each algorithm. The results
of this paper's research demonstrate Eclat and FP-Growth both handle increases
in maximum transaction size and frequent itemset density considerably better
than the Apriori algorithm.

procedure to compensate reactive power generated by loads and, consequently, to
reduce technical losses. So, the problem consists in identifying the optimal
placement and sizing of capacitors. This problem is known in the literature as
optimal capacitor placement problem. Neverthless, depending on the location and
size of the capacitor, it may become a harmonic source, allowing capacitor to
enter into resonance with the distribution network, causing several undesired
side effects. In this work we propose a parsimonious method to deal with the
capacitor placement problem that incorporates resonance constraints, ensuring
that every allocated capacitor will not act as a harmonic source. This proposed
algorithm is based upon a physical inspired metaheuristic known as Extremal
Optimization. The results achieved showed that this proposal has reached
significant gains when compared with other proposals that attempt repair, in a

equations---up to first 26-moments---for granular gases within the framework of
the (inelastic) Boltzmann equation. The homogeneous cooling state of a freely
cooling granular gas is investigated with the Grad's 26-moment equations in a
semi-linearized setting and it is shown that the granular temperature in the
homogeneous cooling state still decays according to Haff's law while the other
higher-order moments decay on a faster time scale. The constitutive relations
for stress and heat flux (the Navier--Stokes and Fourier relations) are
obtained by performing a Chapman--Enskog-like expansion on the Grad's 26-moment
equations and compared with those existing in the literature. The linear
stability of the homogeneous cooling state is analyzed through the Grad's
26-moment system and various sub-systems by decomposing them into longitudinal
and transverse systems. It is found that one eigenmode in both longitudinal and
transverse systems in case of inelastic gases is unstable. By comparing the
eigenmodes from various theories, it is established that the 13-moment
eigenmode theory predicts that the unstable eigenmode remains unstable for all
wavenumbers below a certain coefficient of restitution while any other
higher-order moment theory shows that this mode becomes stable above some
critical wavenumber for all values of coefficient of restitution. In
particular, the Grad's 26-moment theory leads to a smooth profile for the
critical wavenumber in contrast to the other considered theories. Furthermore,
the critical system size obtained through the Grad 26-moment and existing
theories are also in excellent agreement.

square integrable basis functions that support a tridiagonal matrix
representation of the wave operator. This will transform the problem from
solving a system of coupled first order differential equations to solving an
algebraic three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the
wavefunction. In some cases, solutions to this recursion relation can be
related to well-known classes of orthogonal polynomials whereas in other
situations solutions represent new class of polynomials. In this work, we will
discuss various solvable potentials that obey the tridiagonal representation
requirement with special emphasis on simple cases with spin-symmetric and
pseudospin-symmetric potential couplings. We conclude by mentioning some
potential applications in graphene.
