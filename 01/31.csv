between classical group theory and complex vector spaces. Instead, we give a
high-level diagrammatic presentation which showcases the quantum structures

correctness for the abelian HSP protocol, showing that strongly complementary
observables are the key ingredient to its success. Being fully diagrammatic,
our proof extends beyond the traditional case of finite-dimensional quantum

efficiently solved in real quantum theory, and to obtain a protocol that solves
the HSP for certain infinite abelian groups.

well studied core softened potential which is known to qualitatively account
for a large number of water's characteristic anomalies. Along the same lines,
alcohol molecules are idealized by dimers in which the hydroxyl groups interact
with each other and with water with a core softened potential as well.
Interactions involving non-polar groups are all deemed purely repulsive. We
find that the qualitative behavior of excess properties (excess volume,
enthalpy and constant pressure heat capacity) agrees with that found
experimentally for alcohols such as t-butanol in water. Moreover, we observe
that our simple solute under certain conditions acts as an ""structure-maker"",

increases as the solute is added, i.e. the anomalous behavior of the solvent is

important property of a network is its degree correlation or assortativity,
describing how nodes in the network associate based on their number of
connections. Social networks are typically thought to be distinct from other
networks in being assortative (possessing positive degree correlations);
well-connected individuals associate with other well-connected individuals, and
poorly-connected individuals associate with each other. We review the evidence
for this in the literature and find that, while social networks are more
assortative than non-social networks, only when they are built using
group-based methods do they tend to be positively assortative. Non-social
networks tend to be disassortative. We go on to show that connecting
individuals due to shared membership of a group, a commonly used method, biases
towards assortativity unless a large enough number of censuses of the network
are taken. We present a number of solutions to overcoming this bias by drawing
on advances in sociological and biological fields. Adoption of these methods
across all fields can greatly enhance our understanding of social networks and
networks in general.

of possible excursion on Nb3Sn performance. In this study, Nb3Sn strands used
for ITER CS coils are heat treated at different temperatures for different
times. Their critical current, residual resistance ratio and hysteresis losses
are measured. It is found that in the range we studied, critical current and
hysteresis losses do not change significantly. Residual resistance ratio,
however, decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature and time. This is
attributed to the diffusion of metallic elements from the plated Cr layer to
the copper stabilizer. Based on a model of metallic elements diffusion, a

However, it is important in general to prove the correctness of a

algorithmic verification and for the extension to parametric verification. For
that, we adopt a dual view where load buffers are used instead of store
buffers. The flow of information is now from the memory to load buffers. We
show that this new semantics allows (1) to simplify drastically the safety
analysis under TSO, (2) to obtain a spectacular gain in efficiency and
scalability compared to existing procedures, and (3) to extend easily the

decidability result, and more importantly, a verification algorithm that is
more general and more efficient in practice than the one for bounded instances.

there is indeed a consistent picture for the electromagnetic momentum
associated with waves in a dielectric, but one must start with the fields E and
B, not D and H as fundamental objects. The momentum flow is described by a
tensor T^EB, where the expression is identical to that in vacuum. The Minkowski
tensor and the Abraham force result from a fractured decomposition of the
material momentum. However, for well localized fields, the Minkowski momentum
is conserved, consistent with its identification as the canonical momentum.
Several cases are discussed to demonstrate that this perspective is consistent
and complete. In addition, it is shown that that care must be taken to include
momentum transfer to bound charges at dielectric interfaces to correctly
describe, for example, oblique reflections, where there is a normal component

values on the lattice larger than the physical pion mass. We investigate this
extrapolation assuming lattice pion masses in the range of 200 to 400MeV with
the help of two-loop chiral perturbation theory, and find that such an
extrapolation is unlikely to lead to control of this systematic error at the 1%
level. This remains true even if various tricks to improve the reliability of
the chiral extrapolation employed in the literature are taken into account. In
addition, while chiral perturbation theory also predicts the dependence on the

arises in most computer science fields. This problem can be defined as follows:
  Let $D=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots x_d\}$ be a set of $d$ words defined on an alphabet
$\Sigma$, let $q$ be a query defined also on $\Sigma$, and let $k$ be a
positive integer. We want to build a data structure on $D$ capable of answering
the following query: find all words in $D$ that are at most different from the
query word $q$ with $k$ errors.
  In this thesis, we study the approximate string matching methods in
dictionaries, texts, and indexes, to propose practical methods that solve this
problem efficiently. We explore this problem in three complementary directions:
  1) The approximate string matching in the dictionary. We propose two
solutions to this problem, the first one uses hash tables for $k \geq 2$, the
second uses the Trie and reverse Trie, and it is restricted to (k = 1). The two
solutions are adaptable, without loss of performance, to the approximate string
matching in a text.
  2) The approximate string matching for \textit{autocompletion}, which is,
find all suffixes of a given prefix that may contain errors. We give a new
solution better in practice than all the previous proposed solutions.
  3) The problem of the alignment of biological sequences can be interpreted as
an approximate string matching problem. We propose a solution for peers and
multiple sequences alignment.
  \medskip All the results obtained showed that our algorithms, give the best
performance on sets of practical data (benchmark from the real world). All our
methods are proposed as libraries, and they are published online.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluids at a continuum of length-scales. In this
methodology, effective equations are derived for the observable velocity and
magnetic fields spatially-averaged at an arbitrary scale of resolution. The
microscopic equations for the bare velocity and magnetic fields are
renormalized by coarse-graining to yield macroscopic effective equations that
contain both a subscale stress and a subscale electromotive force (EMF)
generated by nonlinear interaction of eliminated fields and plasma motions. At
large coarse-graining length-scales, the direct dissipation of invariants by
microscopic mechanisms (such as molecular viscosity and Spitzer resistivity) is
shown to be negligible. The balance at large scales is dominated instead by the
subscale nonlinear terms, which can transfer invariants across scales, and are
interpreted in terms of work concepts for energy and in terms of topological
flux-linkage for the two helicities. An important application of this approach
is to MHD turbulence, where the coarse-graining length $\ell$ lies in the
inertial cascade range. We show that in the case of sufficiently rough velocity
and/or magnetic fields, the nonlinear inter-scale transfer need not vanish and
can persist to arbitrarily small scales. Although closed expressions are not
available for subscale stress and subscale EMF, we derive rigorous upper bounds
on the effective dissipation they produce in terms of scaling exponents of the
velocity and magnetic fields. These bounds provide exact constraints on
phenomenological theories of MHD turbulence in order to allow the nonlinear
cascade of energy and cross-helicity. On the other hand, we show that the
forward cascade of magnetic helicity to asymptotically small scales is
impossible unless 3rd-order moments of either velocity or magnetic field become
infinite.

the magnetic ordering can potentially have strong influence over the electronic
band structure. The class of AMnBi$_2$ (A = Sr, Ca) compounds are important in
this context as they are known to host massive Dirac fermions with strongly
anisotropic dispersion that is believed to be due to the interplay between
strong SOC and magnetic degrees of freedom. We report the optical conductivity
of YbMnBi$_2$, a newly discovered member of this family and a proposed Weyl
semi-metal (WSM) candidate with broken time reversal symmetry. Together with
density functional theory (DFT) band structure calculations, we show how the
complete conductivity can be interpreted as the sum of a intra-band Drude
response and inter-band transitions. We argue that the canting of the magnetic
moments that has been proposed to be essential for the realization of the WSM
in an otherwise antiferromagnetically ordered system is not necessary to
explain the optical conductivity. We believe our data is explained
qualitatively by the uncanted magnetic structure with a small offset of the
chemical potential from strict stochiometry. There is no definite evidence of
bulk Weyl nodes, instead we see signatures of a gapped Dirac dispersion, common
in other members of AMnBi$_2$ family or compounds with similar 2D network of Bi
atoms.

assess the conditional mean dependence of a response variable on a large number
of covariates. Our procedure is built on the martingale difference divergence
recently proposed in Shao and Zhang (2014), and it is able to detect a certain
type of departure from the null hypothesis of conditional mean independence
without making any specific model assumptions. Theoretically, we establish the
asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistic under suitable assumption
on the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator, which is constructed based on the
characteristic function of the covariates. These conditions can be simplified
under banded dependence structure on the covariates or Gaussian design. To
account for heterogeneity within the data, we further develop a testing
procedure for conditional quantile independence at a given quantile level and
provide an asymptotic justification. Empirically, our test of conditional mean
independence delivers comparable results to the competitor, which was
constructed under the linear model framework, when the underlying model is
linear. It significantly outperforms the competitor when the conditional mean
admits a nonlinear form.

confirms that in MnP the low-temperature and low-pressure helimagnetic phase is
characterised by an increased value of the average magnetic moment compared to
the high-temperature ferromagnetic phase. An elliptical double-helical
structure with a propagation vector ${\bf Q}=(0,0,0.117)$, an $a-$axis moment
elongated by approximately 18% and an additional tilt of the rotation plane
towards $c-$direction by $\simeq 4-8^{\rm o}$ leads to a good agreement between
the theory and the experiment. The analysis of the high-pressure $\mu$SR data
reveals that the new magnetic order appearing for pressures exceeding $1.5$ GPa
can not be described by keeping the propagation vector ${\bf Q} \parallel c$.
Even the extreme case -- decoupling the double-helical structure into four
individual helices -- remains inconsistent with the experiment. It is shown
that the high-pressure magnetic phase which is a precursor of superconductivity
is an incommensurate helical state with ${\bf Q} \parallel b$.

without loss of generality, the approach is used to analyze the diffraction of
an electron beam by a thin aluminum slab as a function of three different
incidence (work) conditions which are of interest in electron microscopy: the
probe width, the tilting angle, and the beam energy. Specifically, it is shown
that, because there is a dependence on particular thresholds of the beam
energy, this approach provides a clear description of the diffraction process
at any energy, revealing at the same time any diversion of the beam inside the
material towards directions that cannot be accounted for by other conventional
methods, which is of much interest when dealing with relatively low energies

special case of unlabeled sensing referred to as Unlabeled Ordered Sampling

natural duality between this problem and classical Compressed Sensing (CS),
where we show that the unknown support (location of nonzero elements) of a
sparse signal in CS corresponds to the unknown indices of the measurements in
UOS. While in CS it is possible to recover a sparse signal from an
under-determined set of linear equations (less equations than the signal
dimension), successful recovery in UOS requires taking more samples than the
dimension of the signal. Motivated by this duality, we develop a Restricted
Isometry Property (RIP) similar to that in CS. We also design a low-complexity
Alternating Minimization algorithm that achieves a stable signal recovery under
the established RIP. We analyze our proposed algorithm for different signal

length rate of the uniform random numbers, called the (variable-length)
resolvability, is investigated. We first analyze the variable-length
resolvability with the variational distance as an approximation measure. Next,
we investigate the case under the divergence as an approximation measure. When
the asymptotically exact approximation is required, it is shown that the
resolvability under the two kinds of approximation measures coincides. We then
extend the analysis to the case of channel resolvability, where the target
distribution is the output distribution via a general channel due to the fixed
general source as an input. The obtained characterization of the channel
resolvability is fully general in the sense that when the channel is just the
identity mapping, the characterization reduces to the general formula for the
source resolvability. We also analyze the second-order variable-length
resolvability.

As Moore's Law is staggering, and the demand for a low-power-consuming
supercomputer is high, the goal of making information processing circuits out
of superconductors is one of the central goals of modern technology and
physics. So far, digital superconducting circuits could not demonstrate their
immense potential. One important reason for this is that a dense
superconducting memory technology is not yet available. Miniaturization of
traditional superconducting quantum interference devices is difficult below a
few micrometers because their operation relies on the geometric inductance of
the superconducting loop. Magnetic memories do allow nanometer-scale
miniaturization, but they are not purely superconducting (Baek et al 2014 Nat.
Commun. 5 3888). Our approach is to make nanometer scale memory cells based on
the kinetic inductance (and not geometric inductance) of superconducting
nanowire loops, which have already shown many fascinating properties (Aprili
2006 Nat. Nanotechnol. 1 15; Hopkins et al 2005 Science 308 1762). This allows
much smaller devices and naturally eliminates magnetic-field cross-talk. We
demonstrate that the vorticity, i.e., the winding number of the order
parameter, of a closed superconducting loop can be used for realizing a
nanoscale nonvolatile memory device. We demonstrate how to alter the vorticity
in a controlled fashion by applying calibrated current pulses. A reliable
read-out of the memory is also demonstrated. We present arguments that such
memory can be developed to operate without energy dissipation.

networks augmented with an external memory can learn the long-term dependency
tasks more easily and achieve better generalization than vanilla recurrent
neural networks (RNN). We suggest that memory augmented neural networks can
reduce the effects of vanishing gradients by creating shortcut (or wormhole)
connections. Based on this observation, we propose a novel memory augmented
neural network model called TARDIS (Temporal Automatic Relation Discovery in
Sequences). The controller of TARDIS can store a selective set of embeddings of
its own previous hidden states into an external memory and revisit them as and
when needed. For TARDIS, memory acts as a storage for wormhole connections to
the past to propagate the gradients more effectively and it helps to learn the
temporal dependencies. The memory structure of TARDIS has similarities to both
Neural Turing Machines (NTM) and Dynamic Neural Turing Machines (D-NTM), but
both read and write operations of TARDIS are simpler and more efficient. We use
discrete addressing for read/write operations which helps to substantially to
reduce the vanishing gradient problem with very long sequences. Read and write
operations in TARDIS are tied with a heuristic once the memory becomes full,
and this makes the learning problem simpler when compared to NTM or D-NTM type
of architectures. We provide a detailed analysis on the gradient propagation in
general for MANNs. We evaluate our models on different long-term dependency
tasks and report competitive results in all of them.

addressing such effects on spatially embedded contact networks. There are two
types of structure in these networks, network structure and spatial structure.
The network structure has been actively studied. The spatial structure of these
networks has received attention only in recent years. Certainly little is known
whether the two structures respond to each other. This study examines the scale
effects, in terms of spatial extent, on the network structure and the spatial
structure of spatially embedded contact networks. Two issues are explored, how
the two types of structures change in response to scale changes, and the range
of the scale effects. Two sets of areal units, regular grids with 24 different
levels of spatial extent and census units of three levels of spatial extent,
are used to divide one observed and two reference random networks into multiple
scales. Six metrics are used to represent the two structures. Results show
different scale effects. In terms of the network structure, the properties of
the observed network are sensitive to scale changes at fine scales. In
comparison, the clustered spatial structure of the network is scale
independent. The behaviors of the network structure are affected by the spatial
structure. This information helps identify vulnerable households and

Agents are pathways (views) through the network which determine the subset of

re-use parts of the optimal path evolved on task A. Positive transfer was

gravitational waves (GWs), and, at the same time, likely accompanied by a
variety of electromagnetic counterparts across the entire spectrum, possibly
including short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and kilonova/macronova transients.
Numerical relativity simulations play a central role in the study of these
events. In particular, given the importance of magnetic fields, various aspects
of this investigation require general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
(GRMHD). So far, most GRMHD simulations focused the attention on BNS mergers
leading to the formation of a hypermassive NS, which, in turn, collapses within
few tens of ms into a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. However,
recent observations suggest that a significant fraction of these systems could
form a long-lived NS remnant, which will either collapse on much longer
timescales or remain indefinitely stable. Despite the profound implications for
the evolution and the emission properties of the system, a detailed
investigation of this alternative evolution channel is still missing. Here, we
follow this direction and present a first detailed GRMHD study of BNS mergers
forming a long-lived NS. We consider magnetized binaries with different mass
ratios and equations of state and analyze the structure of the NS remnants, the
rotation profiles, the accretion disks, the evolution and amplification of
magnetic fields, and the ejection of matter. Moreover, we discuss the
connection with the central engine of SGRBs and provide order-of-magnitude
estimates for the kilonova/macronova signal. Finally, we study the GW emission,

interplanetary magnetic field vectors are nearly parallel to a single plane.
One of the specific regions where PMSs have been reported are coronal mass
ejection (CME)-driven sheaths. We use here an automated method to identify PMSs
in 95 CME sheath regions observed in-situ by the Wind and ACE spacecraft
between 1997 and 2015. The occurrence and location of the PMSs are related to
various shock, sheath and CME properties. We find that PMSs are ubiquitous in
CME sheaths; 85% of the studied sheath regions had PMSs with the mean duration
of 6.0 hours. In about one-third of the cases the magnetic field vectors
followed a single PMS plane that covered a significant part (at least 67%) of
the sheath region. Our analysis gives strong support for two suggested PMS
formation mechanisms: the amplification and alignment of solar wind
discontinuities near the CME-driven shock and the draping of the magnetic field
lines around the CME ejecta. For example, we found that the shock and PMS plane
normals generally coincided for the events where the PMSs occurred near the
shock (68% of the PMS plane normals near the shock were separated by less than
20{\deg} from the shock normal), while deviations were clearly larger when PMSs
occurred close to the ejecta leading edge. In addition, PMSs near the shock
were generally associated with lower upstream plasma beta than the cases where
PMSs occurred near the leading edge of the CME. We also demonstrate that the
planar parts of the sheath contain a higher amount of strongly southward
magnetic field than the non-planar parts, suggesting that planar sheaths are
more likely to drive magnetospheric activity.

cloud core to form one or more protostars, comprising three field strengths
(mass-to-flux ratios, {\mu}, of 5, 10, and 20) and four field geometries (with
values of the angle between the field and rotation axes, {\theta}, of 0{\deg},
20{\deg}, 45{\deg}, and 90{\deg}), using a smoothed particle
magnetohydrodynamics method. We find that the values of both parameters have a
strong effect on the resultant protostellar system and outflows. This ranges
from the formation of binary systems when {\mu} = 20 to strikingly differing
outflow structures for differing values of {\theta}, in particular highly
suppressed outflows when {\theta} = 90{\deg}. Misaligned magnetic fields can
also produce warped pseudo-discs where the outer regions align perpendicular to
the magnetic field but the innermost region re-orientates to be perpendicular
to the rotation axis. We follow the collapse to sizes comparable to those of
first cores and find that none of the outflow speeds exceed 8 km s$^{-1}$.
These results may place constraints on both observed protostellar outflows, and
also on which molecular cloud cores may eventually form either single stars and
binaries: a sufficiently weak magnetic field may allow for disc fragmentation,
whilst conversely the greater angular momentum transport of a strong field may
inhibit disc fragmentation.

Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (LR NURBS) is presented. LR NURBS can model
complex geometries exactly and are the rational extension of LR B-splines. The
local representation of the parameter space overcomes the drawback of
non-existent local refinement in standard NURBS-based isogeometric analysis.
For a convenient embedding into general finite element code, the B\'ezier
extraction operator for LR NURBS is formulated. An automatic remeshing
technique is presented that allows adaptive local refinement and coarsening of
LR NURBS. In this work, LR NURBS are applied to contact computations of 3D
solids and membranes. For solids, LR NURBS-enriched finite elements are used to
discretize the contact surfaces with LR NURBS finite elements, while the rest
of the body is discretized by linear Lagrange finite elements. For membranes,
the entire surface is discretized by LR NURBS. Various numerical examples are
shown, and they demonstrate the benefit of using LR NURBS: Compared to uniform
refinement, LR NURBS can achieve high accuracy at lower computational cost.

two-qubit quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its
projection onto the direction of an external magnetic field (which lifts the

choice of the polarization, shows a clear enhancement over the unpolarized
cross section. More interestingly, the choice of the beam polarization for
which the enhancement is maximum is governed by the size of the light-heavy
neutrino mixing parameter. We also find that using this effect, one can probe a
previously uncharted parameter space of the left-right seesaw model, which is
complementary to the existing searches at both energy and intensity frontiers.

systematically explored, based on the postulates of 1) quantum mechanics 2) the
ability to approximately locally divide quantum gravitational systems into
subsystems 3) correspondence with quantum field theory predictions for
appropriate observers and (optionally) 4) universality of new gravitational
effects. Unitarity requires interactions between the internal state of a black
hole and its surroundings that have not been identified in the field theory
description; correspondence with field theory indicates that these are soft. A
conjectured information-theoretic result for information transfer between
subsystems, partly motivated by a perturbative argument, then constrains the
minimum coupling size of these interactions of the quantum atmosphere of a
black hole. While large couplings are potentially astronomically observable,
given this conjecture one finds that the new couplings can be exponentially
small in the black hole entropy, yet achieve the information transfer rate
needed for unitarization, due to the large number of black hole internal
states. This provides a new possible alternative to arguments for large effects
near the horizon. If universality is assumed, these couplings can be described
as small, soft, state-dependent fluctuations of the metric near the black hole.
Open questions include that of the more fundamental basis for such an effective
picture.

from the 40-month NuSTAR serendipitous survey. The sample is selected to have
robust NuSTAR detections at $3 - 24$~keV, to be at $z < 0.3$, and to have
optical r-band magnitudes at least 0.5~mag fainter than an $L_\star$ galaxy at
its redshift. The median values of absolute magnitude, stellar mass and 2--10
X-ray luminosity of our sample are $\langle M_r\rangle = -20.03$, $\langle
M_\star\rangle = 4.6\times10^{9}M_\odot$, and $\langle
L_{2-10\mathrm{keV}}\rangle = 3.1\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively.
Five objects have detectable broad H$\alpha$ emission in their optical spectra,
indicating black-hole masses of $(1.1-10.4)\times 10^6 M_\odot$. We find that
$30^{+17}_{-10}\%$ of the galaxies in our sample do not show AGN-like optical
narrow emission lines, and one of the ten galaxies in our sample,

that a non-negligible fraction of low-mass galaxies might harbor accreting
massive black holes that are missed by optical spectroscopic surveys and $<10$

optically normal low-mass AGNs cannot be efficiently identified with typical
AGN selection criteria based on WISE colors. While the hard ($>10$ keV) X-ray

sensitive NuSTAR observations are capable of probing faint hard X-ray emission
originating from the nuclei of low-mass galaxies out to moderate redshift

average HeII transmission near the foreground quasars at $3\sigma$

corroborated by a clear dependence of the signal strength on
$\Gamma_\mathrm{QSO}^\mathrm{HeII}$. Our detection places a purely geometrical

magnetic fields provide the restoring forces for global modes of oscillation.
Pressure and buoyancy energetically dominate, while rotation and magnetism are
generally assumed to be weak perturbations and often ignored. However,
observations of anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes in red giant stars
suggest that a substantial fraction of these are subject to an additional
source of damping localised to their core region, with indirect evidence
pointing to the role of a deeply buried magnetic field. It is also known that
in many instances the gravity-mode character of affected modes is preserved,
but so far no effective damping mechanism has been proposed that accommodates
this aspect. Here we present such a mechanism, which damps the oscillations of
stars harbouring magnetised cores via resonant interactions with standing
Alfv\'en modes of high harmonic index. The damping rates produced by this
mechanism are quantitatively on par with those associated with turbulent
convection, and in the range required to explain observations, for realistic
stellar models and magnetic field strengths. Our results suggest that magnetic
fields can provide an efficient means of damping stellar oscillations without
needing to disrupt the internal structure of the modes, and lay the groundwork
for an extension of the theory of global stellar oscillations that incorporates
these effects.

quantum evolution departs from the classical mean field evolution. For
capturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms
of a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple
scalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.
Next, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a
spin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and
simultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent
state of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons
turns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while
their frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the
semi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known
properties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal
Gibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix
scatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this
framework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical
treatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite
quantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times
$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to
the number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time
imposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes
must have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically
acceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate
this bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$ years old in its entire classical
history.

galaxies including self-gravity, non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry,
interstellar radiation fields (IRSF) and shielding, star formation, and stellar
feedback. This includes spatially and temporally varying photoelectric (PE)
heating, photoionization, resolved supernova (SN) blast waves and metal
enrichment. A new flexible method to sample the stellar initial mass function
allows us to follow the contribution to the ISRF, the metal output and the SN
delay times of individual massive stars. We find that SNe play the dominant
role in regulating the global star formation rate, shaping the multi-phase
interstellar medium (ISM) and driving galactic outflows. Outflow rates (with
mass-loading factors of a few) and hot gas fractions of the ISM increase with
the number of SNe exploding in low-density environments where radiative energy
losses are low. While PE heating alone can suppress star formation slightly
more (a factor of a few) than SNe alone can do, it is unable to drive outflows
and reproduce the multi-phase ISM that emerges naturally when SNe are included.
These results are in conflict with recent results of Forbes et al. who
concluded that PE heating is the dominant process suppressing star formation in
dwarfs, about an order of magnitude more efficient than SNe. Potential origins
for this discrepancy are discussed. In the absence of SNe and photoionization
(mechanisms to disperse dense clouds), the impact of PE heating is highly
overestimated owing to the (unrealistic) proximity of dense gas to the
radiation sources. This leads to a substantial boost of the infrared continuum
emission from the UV-irradiated dust and a far infrared line-to-continuum ratio
too low compared to observations. Though sub-dominant in regulating star
formation, the ISRF controls the abundance of molecular hydrogen via
photodissociation.

$\dot{m}=L_{AGN}/L_{Edd}$ and $\eta$ is the mass-to-radiation conversion
efficiency, in low and high accretion rate sources. We find that the SED of the
faster accreting sources are surprisingly similar to those from the comparison
sample of sources with lower accretion rate. In particular: i) the
optical-to-UV AGN SED of slow and fast accreting AGN can be fitted with thin AD
models. ii) The value of $\alpha_{OX}$ is very similar in slow and fast
accreting systems up to a dimensionless accretion rate
$\dot{\mathcal{M}}_{c}\sim$10. We only find a correlation between $\alpha_{OX}$
and $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ for sources with $\dot{\mathcal{M}} >
\dot{\mathcal{M}}_{c}$. In such cases, the faster accreting sources appear to
have systematically larger $\alpha_{OX}$ values. iii) We also find that the
torus in the faster accreting systems seems to be less efficient in
reprocessing the primary AGN radiation having lower IR-to-optical spectral
slopes.
  These findings, failing to recover the predicted differences between the SEDs
of slim and thin ADs within the observed spectral window, suggest that
additional physical processes or very special geometry act to reduce the
extreme UV radiation in fast accreting AGN. This may be related to photon
trapping, strong winds, and perhaps other yet unknown physical processes.

real-world networks. To improve the robustness of any networked system, it is
important to analyze vulnerability to external perturbation such as random
failures or adversarial attacks occurring to elements of the network. In this
paper, we study an emerging problem in assessing the robustness of complex
networks: the vulnerability of the clustering of the network to the failure of
network elements. Specifically, we identify vertices whose failures will
critically damage the network by degrading its clustering, evaluated through
the average clustering coefficient. This problem is important because any
significant change made to the clustering, resulting from element-wise
failures, could degrade network performance such as the ability for information
to propagate in a social network. We formulate this vulnerability analysis as
an optimization problem, prove its NP-completeness and non-monotonicity, and we
offer two algorithms to identify the vertices most important to clustering.
Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments in synthesized social networks
generated by various well-known models as well as traces of real social
networks. The empirical results over other competitive strategies show the
efficacy of our proposed algorithms.

addition to additive white Gaussian noise, also suffers from interference
caused by a co-existing radar transmission. The radar interference (of short
duty-cycle and of much wider bandwidth than the intended communication signal)
is modeled as an additive term whose amplitude is known and constant, but whose
phase is independent and identically uniformly distributed at each channel use.
The capacity achieving input distribution, under the standard average power
constraint, is shown to have independent modulo and phase. The phase is
uniformly distributed in $[0,2\pi]$. The modulo is discrete with countably
infinitly many mass points, but only finitely many in any bounded interval.
From numerical evaluations, a proper-complex Gaussian input is seen to perform
quite well for weak radar interference. We also show that for very large radar
interference, capacity is equal to $1/2\log (1 + S)$ and a proper-complex
Gaussian input achieves it. It is concluded that the presence of the radar
interference results in a loss of half of the degrees of freedom compared to an
AWGN channel without radar interference.

highly localized regions, far smaller than 1 degree at the Sun, are the source
of solar-wind structures spanning more than 20 degrees near Earth. The Sun's
atmosphere is divided into magnetically open regions, coronal holes, where
solar-wind plasma streams out freely and fills the solar system, and closed
regions, where the plasma is confined to coronal loops. The boundary between
these regions extends outward as the heliospheric current sheet (HCS).
Measurements of plasma composition imply that the solar wind near the HCS, the
so-called slow solar wind, originates in closed regions, presumably by the
processes of field-line opening or interchange reconnection. Mysteriously,
however, slow wind is also often seen far from the HCS. We use high-resolution,
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate the dynamics of
a coronal hole whose geometry includes a narrow corridor flanked by closed
field and which is driven by supergranule-like flows at the coronal-hole
boundary. We find that these dynamics result in the formation of giant arcs of
closed-field plasma that extend far from the HCS and span tens of degrees in
latitude and longitude at Earth, accounting for the slow solar wind
observations.

(higher) plastic energy barriers, is proposed as an explanation for our
observations: Plastic barriers, which prevent the annihilation or creation of
topological defects, require dynamic assistance to be overcome and to achieve a
stable VL at each temperature. Conversely, thermal hysteresis in the pining
response is ascribed to low energy barriers, which inhibit rearrangement within
a single VL correlation volume and are easily overcome as the relative strength
of competing interactions changes with temperature.

commonly used to guide task allocation and scheduling on parallel computers.
The critical path is the longest chain of dependencies in an acyclic task
dependence graph. A problem arises on heterogeneous parallel machines where
computation and communication costs can vary between different types of
processor. Existing solutions for heterogeneous machines attempt to estimate
the critical path using average values of computation and communication costs.
However, this ignores opportunities to match specific tasks to specific classes
of processor and communication links, and can result in quite misleading paths
being identified as critical. We argue that an accurate critical path must
consider the mapping of tasks to classes of processor and communication links.
We formulate a polynomial time algorithm to find such a critical path. Our
Critical Earliest Finish Time (CEFT) algorithm finds both the length of the
critical path and an allocation of tasks to processors on that path. We
compared CEFT experimentally to existing approaches such as averaging execution
times across processors. The latter approach fails to accurately model the
execution cost of tasks, and as a result fails to identify a correct critical
path in 83.99% of cases in our experiments. We also adapted a critical
path-oriented scheduling algorithm (CPOP) to use our critical path algorithm
and found that the resulting schedules are faster.

over the 11-33 MHz range with the peak optical depth decreasing from
4$\times10^{-3}$ at 33 MHz to 2$\times10^{-3}$ at 11 MHz, while the line width
increases from 20 km s$^{-1}$ to 150 km s$^{-1}$. The combined change in peak
optical depth and line width results in a roughly constant integrated optical
depth. We interpret this as carbon atoms close to local thermodynamic
equilibrium.
  In this work we focus on how the 11-33 MHz carbon radio recombination lines
can be used to determine the gas physical conditions. We find that the ratio of
the carbon radio recombination lines to that of the 158 $\mu$m [CII]
fine-structure line is a good thermometer, while the ratio between low
frequency carbon radio recombination lines provides a good barometer. By
combining the temperature and pressure constraints with those derived from the
line width we are able to constrain the gas properties (electron temperature
and density) and radiation field intensity. Given the 1$\sigma$ uncertainties
in our measurements these are; $T_{e}\approx68$-$98$ K,
$n_{e}\approx0.02$-$0.035$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T_{r,100}\approx1500$-$1650$ K.

such a population in the accretion flow via means of a pulsar orbiting the
supermassive black hole in our Galaxy. Interactions between the relativistic
pulsar wind with the disc lead to the formation of a bow shock in the wind.
During the pulsar's transit through the accretion disc, relativistic pairs,
accelerated at the shock front, are injected into the disc. The radio-emitting
particles are long-lived and remain within the disc long after the pulsar's
transit. Periodic pulsar transits through the disc result in regular injection
episodes of non-thermal particles. We show that for a pulsar with spin-down

erg/s/cm^2 the 0.5-2 keV energy band) and located at high Galactic latitudes
>20 deg in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) fields with a total area of about
300 deg^2. Photometric SDSS data as well infrared 2MASS and WISE data were used
to select the objects. We selected the point sources from the photometric SDSS
catalog with a magnitude error Delta z<0.2 and a color i-z<0.6 (to first
eliminate the M-type stars). For the selected sources, we have calculated the
dependences chi^2(z) for various spectral templates from the library that we
compiled for these purposes using the EAZY software. Based on these data, we
have rejected the objects whose spectral energy distributions are better
described by the templates of stars at z=0 and obtained a sample of quasars
with photometric redshift estimates 2.75<zphot<5.5. The selection completeness
of known quasars at z>3 in the investigated fields is shown to be about 80%.
The normalized median absolute deviation is 0.07, while the outlier fraction is
eta= 9. The number of objects per unit area in our sample exceeds the number of
quasars in the spectroscopic SDSS sample at the same redshifts approximately by
a factor of 1.5. The subsequent spectroscopic testing of the redshifts of our
selected candidates for quasars at 3<z<5.5 will allow the purity of this sample
to be estimated more accurately.

the curvature of the boundary is unbounded as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$,

context of Reinforcement Learning. The setup is as follows: given an episodic
task and a finite number of off-policy RL algorithms, a meta-algorithm has to
decide which RL algorithm is in control during the next episode so as to
maximize the expected return. The article presents a novel meta-algorithm,
called Epochal Stochastic Bandit Algorithm Selection (ESBAS). Its principle is
to freeze the policy updates at each epoch, and to leave a rebooted stochastic
bandit in charge of the algorithm selection. Under some assumptions, a thorough
theoretical analysis demonstrates its near-optimality considering the
structural sampling budget limitations. ESBAS is first empirically evaluated on
a dialogue task where it is shown to outperform each individual algorithm in
most configurations. ESBAS is then adapted to a true online setting where
algorithms update their policies after each transition, which we call SSBAS.
SSBAS is evaluated on a fruit collection task where it is shown to adapt the
stepsize parameter more efficiently than the classical hyperbolic decay, and on
an Atari game, where it improves the performance by a wide margin.

progenitors of Type Ia supernovae remains unclear. However, in the last decade,
various progenitor scenarios have highlighted the need for detonations to be
the primary mechanism by which these white dwarfs are consumed, but it is
unclear how these detonations are triggered. In this paper we study how
detonations are spontaneously initiated due to temperature inhomogeneities,
e.g., hotspots, in burning nuclear fuel in a simplified physical scenario.
Following the earlier work by Zel'Dovich, we describe the physics of detonation
initiation in terms of the comparison between the spontaneous wave speed and
the Chapman-Jouguet speed. We develop an analytic expression for the
spontaneous wave speed and utilize it to determine a semi-analytic criterion
for the minimum size of a hotspot with a linear temperature gradient between a
peak and base temperature for which detonations in burning carbon-oxygen
material can occur. Our results suggest that spontaneous detonations may easily
form under a diverse range of conditions, likely allowing a number of
progenitor scenarios to initiate detonations that burn up the star.

(2S state) with a ground-state hydrogen atom is resolved. In the the van der
Waals range a_0 << R << a_0/alpha, where a_0= hbar/(alpha m c) is the Bohr

symmetry-dependent result E_{2S;1S}(R) ~ (-176.75 +/- 27.98) E_h (a_0/R)^6 (E_h

constitutes a theoretically interesting problem because of the quasi-degenerate
2P_{1/2} levels which are removed from the 2S states only by the Lamb shift.
The total Hamiltonian of the system is composed of the van der Waals
Hamiltonian, the Lamb shift and the hyperfine effects. The van der Waals shift
becomes commensurate with the 2S-2P_{3/2} fine-structure splitting only for
close approach (R < 100 a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius) and one may thus
restrict the discussion to the levels with n=2 and J=1/2 to good approximation.
Because each S or P state splits into an F=1 triplet and an F=0 hyperfine
singlet (eight states for each atom), the Hamiltonian matrix {\em a priori} is
of dimension 64. A careful analysis of symmetries the problem allows one to
reduce the dimensionality of the most involved irreducible submatrix to 12. We
determine the Hamiltonian matrices and the leading-order van der Waals shifts
for states which are degenerate under the action of the unperturbed Hamiltonian
(Lamb shift plus hyperfine structure). The leading first- and second-order van
der Waals shifts lead to interaction energies proportional to 1/R^3 and 1/R^6
and are evaluated within the hyperfine manifolds. When both atoms are
metastable 2S states, we find an interaction energy of order E_h chi (a_0/R)^6,

solution of the vorticity-modified shallow water equations breaks if it carries
an increase of elevation; the breaking time decreases to zero as the size of
vorticity increases. We propose a full-dispersion shallow water model, which
combines the dispersion relation of water waves and the nonlinear shallow water
equations in the constant vorticity setting, and which extends the Whitham
equation to permit bidirectional propagation. We show that its small amplitude
and periodic traveling wave is unstable to long wavelength perturbations if the
wave number is greater than a critical value, and stable otherwise, similarly
to the Benjamin-Feir instability in the irrotational setting; the critical wave
number grows unboundedly large with the size of vorticity. The result agrees
with that from a multiple scale expansion of the physical problem. We show that
vorticity considerably alters the modulational stability and instability in the

we use laboratory measured optical constants and consider particles of

carbon and of some silicate is better suited for reproducing the flat
extinction in comparison with essentially porous grains or aliphatic carbon
particles. Metallic iron should be located inside the particle, i.e. cannot
form layers on silicate grains as the extinction curves become then very
peculiar. We find a model including aromatic carbonaceous particles and
three-layered particles with an olivine-type silicate core, a thin very porous
layer and a thin envelope of magnetite that provides a good (but still not
perfect) fit to the observational data. We suggest that such silicate dust
should be fresh, i.e. recently formed in the atmospheres of late-type stars in

investigate the $L_\infty$ structure of general gauge invariant perturbative

Einstein gravity, and for double field theory. We find that there is an

to a properly trained OCR to get accurate recognition of the text. The image
enhancement and quality improvement constitute important steps as subsequent
recognition depends upon the quality of the input image. There are scenarios
when high resolution images are not available and our experiments show that the
OCR accuracy reduces significantly with decrease in the spatial resolution of
document images. Thus the only option is to improve the resolution of such
document images. The goal is to construct a high resolution image, given a
single low resolution binary image, which constitutes the problem of single
image super-resolution. Most of the previous work in super-resolution deal with
natural images which have more information-content than the document images.
Here, we use Convolution Neural Network to learn the mapping between low and
the corresponding high resolution images. We experiment with different number
of layers, parameter settings and non-linear functions to build a fast
end-to-end framework for document image super-resolution. Our proposed model
shows a very good PSNR improvement of about 4 dB on 75 dpi Tamil images,
resulting in a 3 % improvement of word level accuracy by the OCR. It takes less
time than the recent sparse based natural image super-resolution technique,

are comparable to max/mean pooling networks. In- terestingly, adaptive pooling
can converge to mean pooling (when initialized with random pooling weights),

output average, recent work has illustrated potential advantages of using a
multitask learning (MTL) framework for projections of individual climate
variables. In this paper we introduce a framework for hierarchical multitask
learning (HMTL) with two levels of tasks such that each super-task, i.e., task
at the top level, is itself a multitask learning problem over sub-tasks. For
climate projections, each super-task focuses on projections of specific climate
variables spatially using an MTL formulation. For the proposed HMTL approach, a
group lasso regularization is added to couple parameters across the
super-tasks, which in the climate context helps exploit relationships among the
behavior of different climate variables at a given spatial location. We show
that some recent works on MTL based on learning task dependency structures can
be viewed as special cases of HMTL. Experiments on synthetic and real climate
data show that HMTL produces better results than decoupled MTL methods applied
separately on the super-tasks and HMTL significantly outperforms baselines for
climate projection.

hypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems
will produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static
network representations, as is currently done. For this purpose, we introduce
the first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA
method is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even
though both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation
across the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity
between static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges
(events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods. For this purpose,
we introduce the first ever measure of dynamic edge conservation and rely on
our recent measure of dynamic node conservation. Importantly, the two dynamic
conservation measures can be optimized using any state-of-the-art NA method and
not just MAGNA++. We confirm our hypothesis that dynamic NA is superior to
static NA, under fair comparison conditions, on synthetic and real-world

crucial to understand the onset of diseases of the retina such as macular
degeneration and retinopathy. A challenge is to periodically image these cells
in human eyes to detect abnormalities well before physiological and
pathological changes occur. However, in vivo imaging of many of these cells is
still elusive despite the phenomenal advances in Optical Coherence Tomography
(OCT) and Adaptive Optics systems. It stems from the fact that cell contrast in
reflection is extremely low. Here, we report a major advance towards this goal
by proposing and demonstrating a method to visualize these cells with high
contrast and resolution. The method uses a transcleral illumination which
provides a high numerical aperture in a dark field configuration. The light
backscattered by the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and Choroid layer
provides a forward illumination for the upper layer of the retina, thus
providing a transmission illumination condition. By collecting the scattered
light through the pupil, the partially coherent illumination produces dark
field images, which are combined to reconstruct a quantitative phase image with
twice the numerical aperture given by the eye's pupil. The retrieved
quantitative phase images (QPI) of cells in ex vivo human and pig's eyes are
validated with those taken with a standard QPI system. We then report, to our
knowledge, the very first human in vivo phase images of inner retinal cells
with high contrast.

intercalation in layered materials. As an important case for Li-ion batteries,
we model single particles of lithium intercalated graphite as having a periodic

described by a generalized Butler-Volmer equation with thermodynamic factors to

solid-solution models based on Fickian diffusion. On the other hand, the

gravity is known to depend both on the matter density and on the angular
velocity profile of circular orbits. It was recently found that this sum goes
to zero at the photon orbits of Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. However,
these are the only relativistic configurations for which such result exists in
the literature. Here, we extend the above formalism in order to describe the
analogous relation for geodesic motion in arbitrary static, axially symmetric,
asymptotically flat solutions of general relativity. The sum of squared
epicyclic frequencies is found to vanish at photon radii of vacuum solutions.
In the presence of matter, we obtain that $\omega_r^2+\omega_\theta^2>0$ for
perturbed timelike circular geodesics on the equatorial plane if the strong
energy condition holds for the matter-energy fluid of spacetime; in vacuum, the
allowed region for timelike circular geodesic motion is characterized by the

$0.4352 M_{\sun}$. We compute the secular rates of period change of radial

representative of ELMV and pre-ELMV stars, as well as for stellar objects that
are evolving just before the occurrence of CNO flashes at the early cooling
branches. We found that the theoretically expected magnitude of $\dot{\Pi}$ of
$g$ modes for pre-ELMVs are by far larger than for ELMVs. In turn, $\dot{\Pi}$
of $g$ modes for models evolving before the occurrence of CNO flashes are
larger than the maximum values of the rates of period change predicted for
pre-ELMV stars. Regarding $p$ and radial modes, we found that the larger
absolute values of $\dot{\Pi}$ correspond to pre-ELMV models. We conclude that
any eventual measurement of a rate of period change for a given pulsating
low-mass pre-white dwarf or white dwarf star could shed light about its
evolutionary status. Also, in view of the systematic difficulties in the
spectroscopic classification of stars of the ELM Survey, an eventual

an authentic low-mass white dwarf and not a star from another stellar

deep neural network to learn a computationally efficient representation of
viscoelastic solutions, at any time, location, and for a large range of

reliably, with high spatial and temporal resolution. We demonstrate that this
machine learning approach accelerates viscoelastic calculations by more than
50,000%. This magnitude of acceleration will enable the modeling of
geometrically complex faults over thousands of earthquake cycles across wider

process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods in a multiattribute

completely unknown and the attribute values take the form of fuzzy numbers.
  Design/methodology/approach: This research has been organized to proceed
along the following steps: computing the grey relational coefficients for
alternatives with respect to each attribute using a fuzzy GRA methodology. Grey
relational coefficients provide the required (output) data for additive DEA
models; computing the priority weights of attributes using the AHP method to
impose weight bounds on attribute weights in additive DEA models; computing
grey relational grades using a pair of additive DEA models to assess the
performance of each alternative from the optimistic and pessimistic
perspectives; and combining the optimistic and pessimistic grey relational
grades using a compromise grade to assess the overall performance of each
alternative.
  Findings: The proposed approach provides a more reasonable and encompassing
measure of performance, based on which the overall ranking position of
alternatives is obtained. An illustrated example of a nuclear waste dump site
selection is used to highlight the usefulness of the proposed approach.
  Originality/value: This research is a step forward to overcome the current

observations at the warden for detecting the transmission. We also determine
the maximum allowable transmit power per channel use, which is shown to
decrease as the blocklength increases. Despite the decrease in the maximum
allowable transmit power per channel use, the maximum allowable total power
over the entire block is proved to increase with the blocklength, which leads
to the fact that the effective throughput increases with the blocklength.

In smooth regions, the scheme applies the central nonlinear interpolation with

containing discontinuities and high wavenumber features, the scheme suppresses
spurious numerical oscillations by hybridizing the central interpolation with
the more dissipative upwind-biased nonlinear interpolation. In capturing
material interfaces between species of different densities, a
quasi-conservative five equation model that can conserve mass of each species

power-consuming and bulky analog phase-shifters that are extensively employed
by traditional analog beamforming schemes; it only requires the deployment of
low-cost analog switches that are easy to implement. Moreover, we show that the
beams formed by such simple antenna on-off switch operations can achieve rather
good performances with low-complexity beamforming algorithms. Specifically, we
first propose two optimal signal-to-noise ratio maximization algorithms to
determine the on-off state of each switch under the per-antenna power

phase-coherent resonant conduction, with charges proceeding via delocalized
molecular orbitals, and incoherent thermally-assisted multi-step hopping. While
in the case of coherent conduction the temperature dependence arises from the
broadening of the Fermi distribution in the metal electrodes, in the latter
case it corresponds to electron-vibration interaction effects on the junction.
With the objective to distill the thermally-activated hopping component, thus
expose intrinsic electron-vibration interaction phenomena on the junction, we
suggest the design of molecular junctions with ""spacers"", extended anchoring
groups that act to filter out phase-coherent resonant electrons. Specifically,
we study the electrical conductance of fixed-gap and variable-gap junctions
that include a tunneling block, with spacers at the boundaries. Using numerical
simulations and analytical considerations, we demonstrate that in our design,
resonant conduction is suppressed. As a result, the electrical conductance is
dominated by two (rather than three) mechanisms: superexchange (deep
tunneling), and multi-step thermally-induced hopping. We further exemplify our
analysis on DNA junctions with an A:T block serving as a tunneling barrier.
Here, we show that the electrical conductance is insensitive to the number of
G:C base-pairs at the boundaries. This indicates that the tunneling-to-hopping
crossover revealed in such sequences truly corresponds to the properties of the
A:T barrier.

energetics and core structure of an isolated screw dislocation in Aluminum.
Using a direct energetics based approach, we estimate the core size of a
perfect screw dislocation to be $\approx$ 7 $|{\bf b}|$, which is considerably
larger than previous estimates of $1-3~|{\bf b}|$ based on displacement fields.
The perfect screw upon structural relaxation dissociates into two Shockley
partials with partial separation distances of 8.2 \AA~and 6.6 \AA~ measured
from the screw and edge component differential displacement plots,
respectively. Similar to a previous electronic structure study on edge
dislocation, we find that the core energy of the relaxed screw dislocation is
strongly dependent on macroscopic deformations. Next, we use the edge and screw
dislocation core energetics data with physically reasonable assumptions to
develop a continuum energetics model for an aggregate of dislocations. Further,
we use this model in a discrete dislocation network, and from the variations of
the core energy with respect to the nodal positions of the network, we obtain
the nodal core force which can directly be incorporated into discrete
dislocation dynamics frameworks. We analyze and classify the nodal core force
into three different contributions based on their decay behavior. Two of these
contributions to the core force, both arising from the core energy dependence
on macroscopic deformations, are not accounted for in currently used discrete
dislocation dynamics models which assume the core energy to be a constant.
Using case studies involving simple dislocation structures, we demonstrate that
the contribution to the core force from the core energy dependence on
macroscopic deformations can be significant in comparison to the elastic
Peach-Koehler force even up to distances of $10-15$ nm between dislocation
structures.

on this observation, we formulate the problem of loop-closure detection as a

enabling real-time robot navigation. This novel formulation requires no offline

online incremental operation. Our approach ensures a unique hypothesis by
choosing only a single globally optimal match when making a loop-closure

equivalence relationship between second-order continuum and car-following
models established in (Jin, 2016) and prove that the nonstandard model and the
LWR model are equivalent, since they have the same anisotropic car-following

introducing the two-parameter $n$-dimensional homogeneous scalar differential
expressions $T_{\alpha,\beta} := - \Delta + \alpha |x|^{-2} x \cdot \nabla +
\beta |x|^{-2}$, $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n \backslash

fundamental inequality, \begin{align} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} [(\Delta f)(x)]^2 \,

particular choice of values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ yields known
Hardy-Rellich-type inequalities, including the classical Rellich inequality and
an inequality due to Schmincke. By locality, these inequalities extend to the
situation where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is replaced by an arbitrary open set $\Omega
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ for functions $f \in C^{\infty}_0(\Omega \backslash

  Perhaps more importantly, we will indicate that our method, in addition to
being elementary, is quite flexible when it comes to a variety of generalized

deformation of the O(3) sigma model preserving integrability. The target space
is deformed from the sphere to ""sausage"" shape by a deformation parameter \nu.
This model is defined by a factorizable S-matrix which is obtained by deforming
that of the O(3) sigma model by a parameter \lambda. Clues for the deformed
sigma model are provided by various UV and IR information through the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) analysis based on the S-matrix. Application of
TBA to the sausage model is, however, limited to the case of 1/\lambda integer
where the coupled integral equations can be truncated to a finite number. In
this paper, we propose a finite set of nonliear integral equations (NLIEs),
which are applicable to generic value of \lambda. Our derivation is based on
T-Q relations extracted from the truncated TBA equations. For consistency
check, we compute next-leading order corrections of the vacuum energy and
extract the S-matrix information in the IR limit. We also solved the NLIE both
analytically and numerically in the UV limit to get the effective central
charge and compared with that of the zero-mode dynamics to obtain exact
relation between \nu and \lambda.
  This paper is a tribute to the memory of Prof. Petr Kulish.

approximation of a rectangular function supported on an arbitrary interval via
function compositions with partial fraction representations. This new best
rational function approximation can be applied to construct spectrum filters of
$(A,B)$ with a smaller number of poles than a direct construction without
function compositions. Combining fast direct solvers and the shift-invariant
generalized minimal residual method, a hybrid fast algorithm is proposed to
apply spectral filters efficiently. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm
FEAST, the proposed rational function approximation is more efficient when
sparse matrix factorizations are required to solve multi-shift linear systems
in the eigensolver, since the smaller number of matrix factorizations is needed
in our method. The efficiency and stability of the proposed method are
demonstrated by numerical examples from computational chemistry.

(sums of concave composed with non-negative modular functions plus a final
arbitrary modular). We then define a new class of submodular functions we call
{\em deep submodular functions} or DSFs. We show that DSFs are a flexible
parametric family of submodular functions that share many of the properties and
advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs). DSFs can be motivated by considering
a hierarchy of descriptive concepts over ground elements and where one wishes
to allow submodular interaction throughout this hierarchy. Results in this
paper show that DSFs constitute a strictly larger class of submodular functions
than SCMMs. We show that, for any integer $k>0$, there are $k$-layer DSFs that
cannot be represented by a $k'$-layer DSF for any $k'<k$. This implies that,
like DNNs, there is a utility to depth, but unlike DNNs, the family of DSFs
strictly increase with depth. Despite this, we show (using a ""backpropagation""
like method) that DSFs, even with arbitrarily large $k$, do not comprise all
submodular functions. In offering the above results, we also define the notion
of an antitone superdifferential of a concave function and show how this
relates to submodular functions (in general), DSFs (in particular), negative
second-order partial derivatives, continuous submodularity, and concave
extensions. To further motivate our analysis, we provide various special case
results from matroid theory, comparing DSFs with forms of matroid rank, in
particular the laminar matroid. Lastly, we discuss strategies to learn DSFs,
and define the classes of deep supermodular functions, deep difference of
submodular functions, and deep multivariate submodular functions, and discuss
where these can be useful in applications.

and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is adopted for the electron
part, and GGA is employed for the phonon part. It is found that SOC has
important influences on their electronic structures, especially for Bi
monolayer, which can induce observable SOC effects on electronic transport
coefficients. More specifically, SOC not only has detrimental influences on
electronic transport coefficients, but also produces enhanced effects. The
calculated lattice thermal conductivity decreases gradually from As to Bi
monolayer, and the corresponding room-temperature sheet thermal conductance is
161.10 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$, 46.62 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ and 16.02 $\mathrm{W
K^{-1}}$, which can be converted into common lattice thermal conductivity by
dividing by the thickness of 2D material. The sheet thermal conductance of Bi
monolayer is lower than one of other 2D materials, such as semiconducting
transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers and orthorhombic group IV-VI
monolayers. A series of scattering time is employed to estimate the
thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$. It is found that the n-type doping has
more excellent thermoelectric properties than p-type doping for As and Bi

analysis, new accurate and high-precision (""robust""; 2SE<2%) 40Ar-39Ar ages
have recently been published, resulting in significant age shifts. In a CSA of
the updated impact age list, the periodicity is strongly reduced. In a CSA of a
list containing only impacts with robust ages, we find no significant
periodicity for the last 500 Ma. We show that if we relax the assumption of a
fully periodic impact record, assuming it to be a mix of a periodic and a
random component instead, we should have found a periodic component if it
contributes more than ~80% of the impacts in the last 260 Ma. The difference
between our CSA and the one by Rampino & Caldeira (2015) originates in a subset
of ""clustered"" impacts (i.e., with overlapping ages). The ~26 Ma periodicity
seemingly carried by these clusters alone is strongly significant if tested
against a random distribution of ages, but this significance disappears if it
is tested against a distribution containing (randomly-spaced) clusters. The
presence of a few impact age clusters (e.g., from asteroid break-up events) in
an otherwise random impact record can thus give rise to false periodicity peaks
in a CSA. There is currently no evidence for periodicity in the impact record.

sizes around distant supermassive black holes that are still well beyond the
spatial resolution of contemporary instrumentation. The sizes measured with
this technique appear inconsistent with the standard accretion disc model. Not
only are the measured accretion disc sizes larger, but their dependence on
wavelength is in most cases completely different from the predictions of the
standard model. We suggest that these discrepancies may arise not from
non-standard accretion disc structure or systematic errors, as it was proposed
before, but rather from scattering and reprocession of the radiation of the
disc. In particular, the matter falling from the gaseous torus and presumably
feeding the accretion disc may at certain distances become ionized and produce
an extended halo that is free from colour gradients. A simple analytical model
is proposed assuming that a geometrically thick translucent inflow acts as a
scattering mirror changing the apparent spatial properties of the disc. This
inflow may be also identified with the broad line region or its inner parts.
Such a model is able to explain the basic properties of the apparent disc
sizes, primarily their large values and their shallow dependence on wavelength.
The only condition required is to scatter significant portion of the luminosity
of the disc. This can easily be fulfilled if the scattering inflow has large
geometrical thickness and clumpy structure.

electroencephalogram (iEEG) has been widely used for monitoring, diagnosing,
and closed-loop therapy of epileptic patients, however, computational
efficiency gains are needed if state-of-the-art methods are to be implemented
in implanted devices. We present a novel method for automatic seizure detection
based on iEEG data that outperforms current state-of-the-art seizure detection
methods in terms of computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy.
The proposed algorithm incorporates an automatic channel selection (ACS) engine
as a pre-processing stage to the seizure detection procedure. The ACS engine
consists of supervised classifiers which aim to find iEEGchannelswhich
contribute the most to a seizure. Seizure detection stage involves feature
extraction and classification. Feature extraction is performed in both
frequency and time domains where spectral power and correlation between channel
pairs are calculated. Random Forest is used in classification of interictal,
ictal and early ictal periods of iEEG signals. Seizure detection in this paper
is retrospective and patient-specific. iEEG data is accessed via Kaggle,
provided by International Epilepsy Electro-physiology Portal. The dataset
includes a training set of 6.5 hours of interictal data and 41 minin ictal data
and a test set of 9.14 hours. Compared to the state-of-the-art on the same
dataset, we achieve 49.4% increase in computational efficiency and 400 mins
better in average for detection delay. The proposed model is able to detect a
seizure onset at 91.95% sensitivity and 94.05% specificity with a mean
detection delay of 2.77 s. The area under the curve (AUC) is 96.44%, that is

observed slow-roll anarchy when fitted to a featureless power spectrum. Future
CMB missions have the key to disentangle among the two possible paradigms and
firmly establish the slow-roll mechanism as the responsible one for the
inflationary period in the early universe. From a model comparison perspective,
and assuming that nature has chosen a featureless primordial power spectrum, we
find that, while with mock Planck data there is only weak evidence against a

evidence against such a non-standard primordial power spectrum.

evolutionary history of a set $X$ of species. This history is often represented
as a phylogenetic network, that is, a connected graph with leaves labelled by
elements in $X$ (for example, an evolutionary tree), which is usually also
binary, i.e. all vertices have degree 1 or 3. A common approach used in
phylogenetics to build a phylogenetic network on $X$ involves constructing it
from networks on subsets of $X$. Here we consider the question of which
(unrooted) phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible, i.e. which networks
can be uniquely reconstructed from the set of networks obtained from it by
deleting a single leaf (its $X$-deck). This problem is closely related to the
(in)famous reconstruction conjecture in graph theory but, as we shall show,
presents distinct challenges. We show that some large classes of phylogenetic
networks are reconstructible from their $X$-deck. This includes phylogenetic
trees, binary networks containing at least one non-trivial cut-edge, and binary
level-4 networks (the level of a network measures how far it is from being a
tree). We also show that for fixed $k$, almost all binary level-$k$
phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible. As an application of our
results, we show that a level-3 network $N$ can be reconstructed from its
quarnets, that is, 4-leaved networks that are induced by $N$ in a certain
recursive fashion. Our results lead to several interesting open problems which
we discuss, including the conjecture that all phylogenetic networks with at
least five leaves are leaf-reconstructible.

used by biologists to represent the evolution of organisms which have undergone
reticulate evolution. Essentially, a phylogenetic network is a directed acyclic
graph having a unique root in which the leaves are labelled by a given set of
species. Recently, some approaches have been developed to construct
phylogenetic networks from collections of networks on 2- and 3-leaved networks,
which are known as binets and trinets, respectively. Here we study in more
depth properties of collections of binets, one of the simplest possible types
of networks into which a phylogenetic network can be decomposed. More
specifically, we show that if a collection of level-1 binets is compatible with
some binary network, then it is also compatible with a binary level-1 network.
Our proofs are based on useful structural results concerning lowest stable
ancestors in networks. In addition, we show that, although the binets do not
determine the topology of the network, they do determine the number of
reticulations in the network, which is one of its most important parameters. We
also consider algorithmic questions concerning binets. We show that deciding
whether an arbitrary set of binets is compatible with some network is at least
as hard as the well-known Graph Isomorphism problem. However, if we restrict to
level-1 binets, it is possible to decide in polynomial time whether there
exists a binary network that displays all the binets. We also show that to find
a network that displays a maximum number of the binets is NP-hard, but that
there exists a simple polynomial-time 1/3-approximation algorithm for this
problem. It is hoped that these results will eventually assist in the
development of new methods for constructing phylogenetic networks from

to global rotation. Even for moderate rotation rates the required energy
injection rate can be reduced by a factor more than $10^3$. This strong
decrease of the onset is attributed to the reduction of the turbulent
fluctuations that makes the flow to have a much larger cut-off length-scale
compared to a non-rotating flow of the same Reynolds number. The dynamo thus
behaves as if it is driven by laminar behaviour (i.e. high $Pm$ behaviour) even
at high values of the Reynolds number (i.e. at low values of $Pm$). Our finding
thus points into a new paradigm for the design of new liquid metal dynamo
experiments.

low-dimensional behavior is based on lift-evolve-restrict maps (called
equation-free methods): first, a user-defined lifting operator maps a set of
low-dimensional coordinates into the high-dimensional phase space, then the
high-dimensional (microscopic) evolution is applied for some time, and finally
a user-defined restriction operator maps down into a low-dimensional space
again. We prove convergence of equation-free methods for finite time-scale
separation with respect to a method parameter, the so-called healing time. Our
convergence result justifies equation-free methods as a tool for performing
high-level tasks such as bifurcation analysis on high-dimensional systems.
  More precisely, if the high-dimensional system has an attracting invariant
manifold with smaller expansion and attraction rates in the tangential
direction than in the transversal direction (normal hyperbolicity), and
restriction and lifting satisfy some generic transversality conditions, then an
implicit formulation of the lift-evolve-restrict procedure generates an
approximate map that converges to the flow on the invariant manifold for
healing time going to infinity. In contrast to all previous results, our result
does not require the time scale separation to be large. A demonstration with
Michaelis-Menten kinetics shows that the error estimates of our theorem are
sharp.
  The ability to achieve convergence even for finite time scale separation is
especially important for applications involving stochastic systems, where the
evolution occurs at the level of distributions, governed by the Fokker-Planck
equation. In these applications the spectral gap is typically finite. We
investigate a low-dimensional stochastic differential equation where the ratio
between the decay rates of fast and slow variables is 2.

  extracellular vesicles in biological samples","Revised version for Colloids and Surfaces B",,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.

Moreover, through extensive simulations, the performance of Local Voting is

from a point to another of the network. Whenever a user requests a video not
directly available at the edge server, the CDN network must 1) identify the
best location in the network where the content is stored, 2) set up a
connection and 3) deliver the video as quickly as possible. For this reason,
existing CDNs are adopting an overlay structure to reduce latency, leveraging
the flexibility introduced by the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm.
In order to guarantee a satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) to users, the
connection must respect several Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. In this
paper, we focus on the sub-problem 2), by presenting an approach to efficiently
compute and maintain paths in the overlay network. Our approach allows to speed
up the transfer of video segments by finding minimum delay overlay paths under
constraints on hop count, jitter, packet loss and relay processing capacity.

FC1 are radiometrically and geometrically calibrated through observations of
standard stars, star fields, and solar system objects. The calibration in each
spectral filter is accurate to within a few percent for point sources.
Geometric distortion, small by design, is characterized with high accuracy.
Dark current, monitored on a regular basis, is very low at flight operational
temperatures. Out-of-field stray light was characterized using the Sun as a
stray light source. In-field stray light is confirmed in narrow-band filter
images of Vesta. Its magnitude and distribution are scene-dependent, and
expected to contribute significantly to images of extended objects. Description
of a method for in-field stray light correction is deferred to a follow-up
paper, as is a discussion of the closely related topic of flat-fielding.

is thus a powerful tool, in addition of tSZ and X-ray based analysis, to test
our modeling of both tSZ and X-ray emission from galaxy clusters. We chose to
explore this cross correlation as both emissions trace the hot gas in galaxy

We present a complete modeling of the cross correlation between tSZ effect and
X-ray emission from galaxy clusters, and focuses on the dependencies with
clusters scaling laws and cosmological parameters. We show that the present
knowledge of cosmological parameters and scaling laws parameters leads to an
uncertainties of 47\% on the overall normalization of the tSZ-X cross

the tSZ-X cross-correlation angular power spectrum considering the sensitivity
of actual tSZ and X-ray surveys from {\it Planck}-like data and ROSAT. We
demonstrate that this signal-to-noise can reach 31.5 in realistic situation,
leading to a constraint on the amplitude of tSZ-X cross correlation up to
3.2\%, fifteen times better than actual modeling limitations. Consequently,
used in addition to other probes of cosmological parameters and scaling
relations, we show that the tSZ-X is a powerful probe to constrain scaling

the Fabry-Perot modes which introduce additional scattering and eventually
destroy the invisibility. Here we reveal that for shorter rods with modest

Until recently the rise phase, particularly the phenomenon of a pre-maximum
halt, was observed sporadically. Solar observation satellites observing Coronal
Mass Ejections enable us to observe the pre-maximum phase in unprecedented
temporal resolution. We present observations of V5589 Sgr with STEREO HI-1B at
a cadence of 40 min, the highest to date. We temporally resolve a pre-maximum
halt for the first time, with two examples each rising over 40 min then
declining within 80 min. Comparison with a grid of outburst models suggests
this double peak, and the overall rise timescale, are consistent with a white
dwarf mass, central temperature and accretion rate close to 1.0 solar mass,
5x10^7 K and 10^-10 solar masses per year respectively. The modelling formally
predicts mass loss onset at JD 2456038.2391+/-0.0139, 12 hrs before optical
maximum. The model assumes a main-sequence donor. Observational evidence is for
a subgiant companion; meaning the accretion rate is under-estimated.
Post-maximum we see erratic variations commonly associated with much slower
novae. Estimating the decline rate difficult, but we place the time to decline
two magnitudes as 2.1 < t_2(days) < 3.9 making V5589 Sgr a ""very fast"" nova.
The brightest point defines ""day 0"" as JD 2456038.8224+/-0.0139, although at
this high cadence the meaning of the observed maximum becomes difficult to
define. We suggest that such erratic variability normally goes undetected in
faster novae due to the low cadence of typical observations; implying erratic
behaviour is not necessarily related to the rate of decline.

to study how the spectrum changes with increasing phase angle (phase

assigned ground truth labels (spam/not-spam), or it may be desired to directly
compare the biological networks of different species or compound networks of
different chemicals.
  In this work we introduce the problem of characterizing the differences
between attributed subgraphs that belong to different classes. We define this
characterization problem as one of partitioning the attributes into as many
groups as the number of classes, while maximizing the total attributed quality
score of all the given subgraphs.
  We show that our attribute-to-class assignment problem is NP-hard and an
optimal $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation algorithm exists. We also propose two
different faster heuristics that are linear-time in the number of attributes
and subgraphs. Unlike previous work where only attributes were taken into
account for characterization, here we exploit both attributes and social ties
(i.e. graph structure).
  Through extensive experiments, we compare our proposed algorithms, show
findings that agree with human intuition on datasets from Amazon co-purchases,
Congressional bill sponsorships, and DBLP co-authorships. We also show that our

the context of the difference between galaxy clusters and CMB for the

  However, the tSZ effect maps are highly contaminated by cosmic infra-red

  Unlike other astrophysical components, the spatial distribution of CIB varies
with frequency.
  Thus it cannot be completely removed from a tSZ Compton parameter map, which
is constructed from a linear combination of multiple frequency maps.

It displays short-term light curve variations which are originated due to
either a beating phenomenon or a non-periodic variation. In this paper, we
presented high-precision photometric data of HD 90386 taken by the STEREO
satellite between 2007 and 2011 to shed light on its internal structure and
evolution stage. From the frequency analysis of the four-year data, we detected
that HD 90386 had at least six different frequencies between 1 and 15
c~d$^{-1}$. The most dominant frequencies were found at around 10.25258
c~d$^{-1}$ (A $\sim$ 1.92 mmag) and 12.40076 c~d$^{-1}$ (A $\sim$ 0.61 mmag).
Based on the ratio between these frequencies, the star was considered as an
overtone pulsator. The variation in pulsation period over 35 years was
calculated to be dP/Pdt = 5.39(2) x 10$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Other variabilities at
around 1.0 c~d$^{-1}$ in the amplitude spectrum of HD90386 were also discussed.
In order to explain these variabilities, possible rotational effects and Gamma
Dor type variations were focused. Consequently, depending on the rotation
velocity of HD 90386, we speculated that these changes might be related to
Gamma Dor type high-order g-modes shifted to the higher frequencies and that HD
90386 might be a hybrid star.

Becher and Heiber (2013) in terms of ""lossless finite-state compressors"" do not
follow the standard scheme of Kolmogorov complexity definition (an automaton is
used for compression, not decompression). We modify this approach to make it
more similar to the traditional Kolmogorov complexity theory (and simpler) by
explicitly defining the notion of automatic Kolmogorov complexity and using its
simple properties.
  Using this characterization and a sufficient condition for normality in terms
of Kolmogorov complexity derived from it, we provide easy proofs for classical
results about normal sequences (Champernown, Wall, Piatetski-Shapiro,
Besicovitch, Copeland, Erdos et al.)
  Then we extend this approach to finite state dimension. We show that the
block entropy definition of the finite state dimension remains the same if
non-aligned blocks are used. Then we provide equivalent definitions in terms of
automatic complexity, superadditive bounds for Kolmogorov complexity,
calibrated superadditive functions and finite state a priori probability and
use them to give simple proofs for known results about finite state dimension,
and for Agafonov's result saying that normality is preserved by automatic

normality to finite state martingales.

microwave background (CMB) photons with the ionized and diffuse gas of
electrons inside galaxy clusters integrated along the line of sight. The two
main effects are the thermal SZ (tSZ) produced by thermal pressure inside
galaxy clusters and the kinetic SZ (kSZ) produce by peculiar motion of galaxy
clusters compared to CMB rest-frame. The kSZ effect is particularly challenging
to measure as it follows the same spectral behavior as the CMB, and
consequently can not be separated from the CMB using spectral considerations.
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting the kSZ through the
computation of the tSZ-CMB-CMB cross-correlation bispectrum for current and
future CMB experiments. We conclude that next generation of CMB experiments
will offer the possibility to detect at high S/N the tSZ-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum.
This measurement will constraints the intra-cluster dynamics and the velocity
field of galaxy cluster that is extremely sensitive to the growth rate of
structures and thus to dark energy properties. Additionally, we also
demonstrate that the tSZ-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum can be used to break the
degeneracies between the mass-observable relation and the cosmological
parameters to set tight constraints, up to 4\%, on the $Y-M$ relation

We find that in the center of a skyrmion the peak energy and intensity scale
roughly linear with the angle between nearest neighbor moments. Elsewhere in

disturbances in the heliosphere. Models of CME dynamics have been proposed that
do not fully include the effects of magnetic reconnection on the forces driving
the ejection. Both observations and numerical modeling, however, suggest that
reconnection likely plays a major role in most, if not all, fast CMEs. Here, we
theoretically investigate the accretion of magnetic flux onto a rising ejection
by reconnection involving the ejection's background field. This reconnection
alters the magnetic structure of the ejection and its environment, thereby
modifying the forces acting upon the ejection, generically increasing its
upward acceleration. The modified forces, in turn, can more strongly drive the
reconnection. This feedback process acts, effectively, as an instability, which
we refer to as a reconnective instability. Our analysis implies that CME models
that neglect the effects of reconnection cannot accurately describe observed
CME dynamics. Our ultimate aim is to understand changes in CME acceleration in
terms of observable properties of magnetic reconnection, such as the amount of
reconnected flux. This flux can be estimated from observations of flare ribbons
and photospheric magnetic fields.

perturbation, i.e. the Zel'dovich solution. However, the single-stream flow no
longer holds after shell-crossing and a proper account of the multi-stream flow
is essential for post-collapse dynamics. In this paper, extending previous work
by Colombi (2015, MNRAS 446, 2902), we present a perturbative description for
the multi-stream flow after shell-crossing in a cosmological setup. In
addition, we introduce an adaptive smoothing scheme to deal with the bulk
properties of phase-space structures. The filtering scales in this scheme are
linked to the next-crossing time in the post-collapse region, estimated from
our PT calculations. Our PT treatment combined with adaptive smoothing is
illustrated in several cases. Predictions are compared to simulations and we
find that post-collapse PT with adaptive smoothing reproduces the power
spectrum and phase-space structures remarkably well even at small scales, where

at a particular point in state space. We then make a mean-field assumption and
thereby derive an integro-partial differential equation that is satisfied by
the LSDD. We perform numerical experiments and find good agreement between
solutions of the integro-differential equation and the LSDD from stochastic
simulations of the full model. To illustrate our theory, we apply it to a
simple continuum model for osteocyte network formation within bones, with a
view to understanding changes that may take place during cancer. Our results
suggest that increased rates of differentiation lead to higher densities of
osteocytes but with a lower number of dendrites. To help provide biological
context, we also include an introduction to osteocytes, the formation of
osteocyte networks, and the role of osteocytes in bona metastasis.

of the weakly magnetized intergalactic plasma are not yet well known. We
investigate the constraints that can be placed by an azimuthally resolved study
of the cold front in Abell 3667 using $\sim$500 ksec archival Chandra data. We
find that the radius of the interface fluctuates with position angle and the
morphology of the interface is strikingly similar to recent numerical
simulations of inviscid gas-stripping. We find multiple edges in the surface
brightness profiles across the cold front as well as azimuthal variations,
which are consistent with the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities (KHI)
developing along the cold front. They indicate that the characteristic length
scale of KHI rolls is around 20-80 kpc. This is the first observational
indication of developing KHIs along a merger cold front in a galaxy cluster.
Based on the KHI scenario, we estimated the upper limit of the ICM effective
viscosity. The estimated value of $\mu\lesssim200~\mathrm{g/cm/s}$ is at most
5% of the isotropic Spitzer-like viscosity. The observed apparent mixing
towards the outer edges away from the tip of the front provides an additional
evidence for suppressed viscosity.

  series via asymptotic approximants",,,"10.1093/qjmam/hbw014",,"math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  A compact and accurate solution method is provided for problems whose
infinite power series solution diverges and/or whose series coefficients are
only known up to a finite order. The method only requires that either the power
series solution or some truncation of the power series solution be available
and that some asymptotic behavior of the solution is known away from the
series' expansion point. Here, we formalize the method of asymptotic
approximants that has found recent success in its application to thermodynamic
virial series where only a few to (at most) a dozen series coefficients are
typically known. We demonstrate how asymptotic approximants may be constructed
using simple recurrence relations, obtained through the use of a few known
rules of series manipulation. The result is an approximant that bridges two
asymptotic regions of the unknown exact solution, while maintaining accuracy
in-between. A general algorithm is provided to construct such approximants. To
demonstrate the versatility of the method, approximants are constructed for
three nonlinear problems relevant to mathematical physics: the Sakiadis
boundary layer, the Blasius boundary layer, and the Flierl-Petviashvili
monopole. The power series solution to each of these problems is underspecified
since, in the absence of numerical simulation, one lower-order coefficient is
not known; consequently, higher-order coefficients that depend recursively on
this coefficient are also unknown. The constructed approximants are capable of
predicting this unknown coefficient as well as other important properties
inherent to each problem. The approximants lead to new benchmark values for the
Sakiadis boundary layer and agree with recent numerical values for properties
of the Blasius boundary layer and Flierl-Petviashvili monopole.

has produced significant results, enabling researchers to recover texts that
would be otherwise lost under the visible overtext, by improving the contrast
between the undertext and the overtext. In this paper we explore an extended
number of multispectral and hyperspectral image analysis methods, consisting of
supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, on a part of
the Syriac Galen Palimpsest dataset (www.digitalgalen.net). Of this extended
set of methods, eight methods gave good results: three were supervised methods
Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA); and the other five methods were
unsupervised methods (but still used in a supervised way) Gaussian Process
Latent Variable Model (GPLVM), Isomap, Landmark Isomap, Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA). The
relative success of these methods was determined visually, using color
pictures, on the basis of whether the undertext was distinguishable from the
overtext, resulting in the following ranking of the methods: LDA, NCA, GDA,
Isomap, Landmark Isomap, PPCA, PCA, and GPLVM. These results were compared with
those obtained using the Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) method on the same
dataset, which showed remarkably accuracy (LDA is a particular case of CVA
where the objects are classified to two classes).

  symmetrization phase transition of delta-AlOOH",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the delta phase of
the hydrous mineral AlOOH at ambient temperature and high pressure. Nuclear
quantum effects were included through a Langevin dynamics in a bath of quantum
harmonic oscillators.
  We confirm that under increasing pressure delta-AlOOH undergoes a phase
transition from a $P2_1nm$ structure with asymmetric and disordered O-H bonds
to a stiffer $Pnnm$ phase with symmetric hydrogen bonds, which should be stable
within the pressure and temperature ranges typical for the Earth's mantle.
  The transition is initially triggered by proton tunneling, which makes the
mean proton position to coincide with the midpoint of the O-O distance, at
pressures as low as 10 GPa. However, only at much larger pressures, around 30
GPa as previously found by other calculations, the Pnnm phase with symmetric
hydrogen bonds is stable from the classical point of view.
  The transition is also characterized through the analysis of the H-O
stretching modes, which soften considerably and fade out around 10 GPa in the
P2_1nm structure, when thermal and nuclear quantum effects are taken into
account in the simulations. At variance, the harmonic picture is not adequate
to describe the highly anharmonic effective potential that is seen by the
protons at the transition.
  Finally, we propose that the picture of a dynamical transition to the
high-symmetry and proton-centered Pnnm phase, which is brought about by the
onset of proton tunneling, could be confirmed by quasi-elastic neutron
scattering and vibrational spectroscopy under pressure.
