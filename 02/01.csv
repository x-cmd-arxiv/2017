better understand the chemical processes of the early Universe. Computing a
stellar spectrum in 3D allows one to model complex stellar behaviours, which
cannot be replicated in 1D. Aims. We examine the effect that the intrinsic CNO
abundances have on a 3D model structure and the resulting 3D spectrum
synthesis. Methods. Model atmospheres were computed in 3D for three distinct
CNO chemical compositions using the CO 5 BOLD model atmosphere code, and their
internal structures were examined. Synthetic spectra were computed from these
models using Linfor3D and they were compared. New 3D abundance corrections for
the G-band and a selection of UV OH lines were also computed. Results. The
varying CNO abundances change the metal content of the 3D models. This had an
effect on the model structure and the resulting synthesis. However, it was
found that the C/O ratio had a larger effect than the overall metal content of
a model. Conclusions. Our results suggest that varying the C/O ratio has a
substantial impact on the internal structure of the 3D model, even in the hot
turn-off star models explored here. This suggests that bespoke 3D models, for
specific CNO abundances should be sought. Such effects are not seen in 1D at
these temperature regimes.

which maximise their subsequent energy growth after a certain later time $T$
can be used to probe phase space around a reference state and ultimately to
find other nearby solutions. The procedure relies on the fact that of all the
initial disturbances on a constant-energy hypersphere, the optimisation
procedure will naturally select the one which lies nearest to the stable
manifold of a nearby solution in phase space if $T$ is large enough. Then, when
in its subsequent evolution, the optimal disturbance transiently approaches the
new solution, a flow state at this point can be used as an initial guess to
converge the solution to machine precision. We illustrate this approach in
plane Couette flow by: a) rediscovering the spanwise-localised `snake'
solutions of Schneider et al. (2010b); b) probing phase space at very low
Reynolds numbers ($< 127.7$) where the constant linear-shear solution is
believed to be the global attractor; and finally c) examining how the edge
between laminar and turbulent flow evolves when stable stratification kills the
turbulent attractor. We also show that the steady snake solution smoothly
delocalises as unstable stratification is gradually turned on until it connects
(via an intermediary global 3D solution) to 2D Rayleigh-Benard roll solutions.

Interestingly, reports from multiple groups suggest that miRNA targets may be
coupled through competitive stoichiometric sequestration [2]. Specifically,
computational models predicted [3, 4] and experimental assays confirmed [5, 6]
that miRNA activity is dependent on miRNA target abundance, and consequently,
changes to the abundance of some miRNA targets lead to changes to the
regulation and abundance of their other targets. The resulting indirect
regulatory influence between miRNA targets resembles competition and has been
dubbed competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) [5, 7, 8]. Recent studies have
questioned the physiological relevance of ceRNA interactions [9], researchers
ability to accurately predict these interactions [10], and the number of genes
that are impacted by ceRNA interactions in specific cellular contexts [11].
Results: To address these concerns, we reverse engineered ceRNA networks
(ceRNETs) in breast and prostate adenocarcinomas using context-specific TCGA
profiles [12-14], and tested whether ceRNA interactions can predict the effects
of RNAi-mediated gene silencing perturbations in PC3 and MCF7 cells. Our
results, based on tests of thousands of inferred ceRNA interactions that are
predicted to alter hundreds of cancer genes in each of the two tumor contexts,
confirmed statistically significant effects for half of the predicted targets.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the expression of a significant fraction
of cancer genes may be regulated by ceRNA interactions in each of the two tumor
contexts.

shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on
large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empirical experimentation
how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to
seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a
simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results
across five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard
shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch.
Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also
report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we
demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the
amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on
manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on
clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The
system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the

from RHESSI and SDO/AIA, there is a unprecedented possibility to 'look inside'
CXSs and to answer the questions about their formation, evolution and
structure. We present a study of a CXS of the SOL2011-10-22T11:10 long-duration
flare observed simultaneously with RHESSI and SDO/AIA. We focus our attention
on the following questions: What was responsible for the CXS presence and long
duration? Was there any fine structure in the CXS? Available data enables us to
study a relation between the CXS and structures observed in EUV during the
decay phase of the flare. X-ray emission recorded by RHESSI during the decay
phase of the flare came from about 10 MK hot CXS. The source was observable for
5 hours. This long presence of the source could be supported by magnetic
reconnection ongoing during the decay phase. Supra-arcade downflows, which are
considered to be a manifestation of magnetic reconnection, were observed at the
same time as the CXS. The source was co-spatial with the part of the hot
supra-arcade region that had the highest emission measure and simultaneously
the temperature within the range of RHESSI thermal-response. However, while the
supra-arcade region was a dynamic region consisting of small-scale structures,
the CXS seemed to be smooth, structureless. We run simulations using real and
synthetic RHESSI data, but we did not find any strong evidence that the CXS had
any small-scale structure.

to exist an equivalent reformulation which does not refer to classical time. We
propose such a reformulation, based on a non-commutative special relativity. In
the spirit of Trace Dynamics, the reformulation is arrived at, as a statistical
thermodynamics of an underlying classical dynamics in which matter and
non-commuting space-time degrees of freedom are matrices obeying arbitrary
commutation relations. Inevitable statistical fluctuations around equilibrium
can explain the emergence of classical matter fields and classical space-time,
in the limit in which the universe is dominated by macroscopic objects. The

the peculiar nature of quantum non-locality, where the effect of wave-function

saturation of the quantum information bound [QIB]. This occurs when the Fisher
information associated to a given measurement on the quantum state of a system
which encodes the information about the parameter coincides with the quantum
Fisher information associated to that quantum state. Braunstein and Caves [PRL
{\bf 72}, 3439 (1994)] have shown that the QIB can always be achieved via a

symmetric logarithmic derivative. However, such projective measurement depends,
in general, on the value of the parameter to be estimated. Requiring,
therefore, the previous knowledge of the quantity one is trying to estimate.

find that at a typical device operating point, positive electrothermal feedback
reduces the effective thermal conductance from the superconductor
quasiparticles to the bath, and so increases responsivity to signal
(pair-breaking) power, increases noise from temperature fluctuations, and
decreases the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP). Similarly, increasing the thermal
isolation of the device while keeping the quasiparticle temperature constant
decreases the NEP, but also decreases the device response bandwidth.

perturbation theory and includes hyperfine coupling of the electrons to both
the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the nucleus. For
$^{27}$Al$^+$, a fortuitous cancellation leads to a suppressed frequency shift.
This should allow for continued improvement of the clock without special
techniques to control or cancel the shift, such as the averaging schemes that
are critical to other optical ion clocks.

extensively debated as quantifiers of dynamical chaos in interacting quantum
many-body systems. We argue that in quantum spin and fermionic systems, where
all local operators are bounded, an OTOC of local observables is bounded as
well and thus its exponential growth is merely transient. As a better measure
of quantum chaos in such systems, we propose, and study, the density of the
OTOC of extensive sums of local observables, which can exhibit indefinite
growth in the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate this for the kicked quantum
Ising model by using large-scale numerical results and an analytic solution in
the integrable regime. In a generic case, we observe the growth of the OTOC
density to be linear in time. We prove that this density in general, locally
interacting, non-integrable quantum spin and fermionic dynamical systems
exhibits growth that is at most polynomial in time---a phenomenon, which we
term weak quantum chaos. In the special case of the model being integrable and
the observables under consideration quadratic, the OTOC density saturates to a
plateau.

the predicted relic neutrino background is strongly inconsistent with detection
rates measured in solar neutrino detectors (Borexino in particular). Thus
quasi-metric cosmology is in violent conflict with experiment unless some

undetectable (e.g., if all massive neutrino mass eigenstates decay into

existence of dampened repetitions of the primary signal. Here we use the fact
that non-perturbative corrections to the near-horizon external geometry of
black holes are necessary for these modifications to exist, in order to
classify different proposals and paradigms with respect to this criterion and
study in a neat and systematic way their phenomenology. Proposals that lead
naturally to the existence of echoes in the late-time ringdown of gravitational
wave signals from black hole mergers must share the replacement of black holes
by horizonless configurations with a physical surface showing reflective
properties in the relevant range of frequencies. On the other hand, proposals
or paradigms that restrict quantum gravity effects on the external geometry to
be perturbative, such as black hole complementarity or the closely related
firewall proposal, do not display echoes. For the sake of completeness we
exploit the interplay between the timescales associated with the formation of
firewalls and the mechanism behind the existence of echoes in order to conclude
that even unconventional distortions of the firewall concept (such as naked
firewalls) do not lead to this phenomenon.

populations between a high incidence TB country (A) and a host country (B) with
low TB incidence, where (B) is divided into a community (G) with high
percentage of people from (A) plus the rest of the population (C). Contrary to
some beliefs, related to the fact that agglomerations of individuals increase
proportionally to the disease spread, analysis of the model shows that the
existence of semi-closed communities are beneficial for the TB control from a
global viewpoint. The model and techniques proposed are applied to a case-study
with concrete parameters, which model the situation of Angola (A) and Portugal
(B), in order to show its relevance and meaningfulness. Simulations show that
variations of the transmission coefficient on the origin country has a big
influence on the number of infected (and infectious) individuals on the
community and the host country. Moreover, there is an optimal ratio for the
distribution of individuals in (C) versus (G), which minimizes the reproduction
number $R_0$. Such value does not give the minimal total number of infected
individuals in all (B), since such is attained when the community (G) is
completely isolated (theoretical scenario). Sensitivity analysis and curve
fitting on $R_0$ and on EDSs are pursuit in order to understand the TB effects
in the global statistics, by measuring the variability of the relevant
parameters. We also show that the TB transmission rate $\beta$ does not act
linearly on $R_0$, as is common in compartment models where system feedback or
group interactions do not occur. Further, we find the most important parameters
for the increase of each EDS.

characterized via XRD, XRF, FESEM, FTIR, N2 adsorption-desorption techniques,
and temperature-programmed NH3 desorption and they were compared with
conventional microporous SAPO-34. Introduction of non-ionic PEG capping agent
affected the degree of homogeneity and integrity of the synthesis media and
thus reduced the number of nuclei and order of coordination structures
resulting in larger and less crystalline particles compared with the
conventional sample. During the calcination process, decomposition of absorbed
PEG moieties among the piled up SAPO patches formed a great portion of tuned
mesopores into the microporous matrix. These tailored mesopores were served as
auxiliary diffusion pathways in MTO reaction. The effects of molecular weight
of PEG and PEG/Al molar ratio on the properties of the synthesized materials
were investigated in order to optimize their MTO reaction performance. It was
revealed that both of these two parameters can significantly change the
structural composition and physicochemical properties of resultant products.
Using PEG with MW of 6000 has led to the formation of RHO and CHA structural
frameworks i.e. DNL-6 and SAPO-34, simultaneously, while addition of PEG with
MW of 4000 resulted the formation of pure SAPO-34 phase. Altering the PEG/Al
molar ratio in the precursor significantly influenced the porosity and acidity
of the synthesized silicoaluminophosphate products. SAPO-34 impregnated with
PEG molecular weight of 4000 and PEG/Al molar ratio of 0.0125 showed superior
catalytic stability in MTO reaction because of the tuned bi-modal porosity and
tailored acidity pattern.

  Aims: We would like to test mode identification methods and seismic

  Methods: We investigate the auto-correlation function and Fourier transform
of theoretically calculated frequency spectra, in which modes are selected
according to their visibilities. Given the difficulties in predicting intrinsic
mode amplitudes, we experimented with various ad-hoc prescriptions for setting
these, including using random values. Furthermore, we analyse the ratios
between mode amplitudes observed in different photometric bands.
  Results: When non-random intrinsic mode amplitudes are used, our results show
that it is possible to extract the large frequency separation or half its
value, and sometimes twice the rotation rate, from the auto-correlation
function. The Fourier transforms are mostly sensitive to the large frequency
separation or half its value. When the intrinsic mode amplitudes include random
factors, the results are far less favourable. We also find that amplitude
ratios provide a good way of grouping together modes with similar
characteristics. By analysing the frequencies of these groups, it is possible
to constrain mode identification as well as determine the large frequency
separation and the rotation rate.

binary quartic in characteristic 3. In the second section, we construct a new

down enough to be trapped by the barriers of its periodic potential. Such a

compared with a high-resolution spectrum observed with STIS equipment in the
1250-3040 A interval. The adopted model is an ATLAS12 model already used for
the abundance analysis of a high-resolution optical spectrum observed at ESO
with UVES. The stellar parameters are Teff=13450K, logg=4.3, and zero
microturbulent velocity. Abundances for 28 elements and 7 upper limits were

have now quantitative results for 37 elements, some of which show striking
contrasts with those of a broad sample of HgMn stars. The analysis has pointed
out ionization anomalies and line-to-line variation in the derived abundances,

non-LTE effects and with the occurrence of diffusion and vertical abundance

become an indispensable component in a variety of neural architectures. A
completely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we
present a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training
very deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to
the singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such
singularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities
caused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination
singularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation,
of nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes.
These singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow
down learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by
breaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node
elimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for
typical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the
""ghosts"" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to
alleviate the learning slow-down. These hypotheses are supported by evidence
from simplified models, as well as from experiments with deep networks trained
on real-world datasets.

successful ""high-foot"" CH capsules. Several keyhole and ConA targets preceeded
a DT layered shot. In addition to backscatter subtraction, laser drive
multipliers were needed to match observed X-ray drives. Those for the picket
(0.95), trough (1.0) and second pulse (0.80) were determined by VISAR
measurements. The time dependence of the Dante total x-ray flux and its
fraction > 1.8 keV reflect the time dependence of the multipliers. A two step
drive multiplier for the main pulse can match implosion times, but Dante
measurements suggest the drive multiplier must increase late in time. With a
single set of time dependent, multi-level multipliers the Dante data are well
matched. These same third pulse drive multipliers also match the implosion
times and Dante signals for two CH capsule DT. One discrepancy in the
calculations is the X-ray flux in the picket. Calculations over-estimate the
flux > 1.8 keV by a factor of ~100, while getting the total flux correctly.
These harder X-rays cause an expansion of the Be/fuel interface of 2-3 km/s
before the arrival of the first shock. VISAR measurements show only 0.2 to 0.3
km/s. The X-ray drive on the DT Be capsule was further degraded by a random
decrease of 9% in the total picket flux. This small change caused the capsule
fuel to change from an adiabat of 1.8 to 2.3 by mistiming of the first and
second shocks. With this shock tuning and adjustments to the calculation, the
first NIF Be capsule implosion achieved 29% of calculated yield, comparable to
the CH DT capsules of 68% and 21%. Inclusion of a large M1 asymmetry in the DT
ice layer and mixing from instability growth may help explain this final
degradation. In summary when driven similarly the Be capsules performed like CH
capsules. Performance degradation for both seems to be dominated by drive and
capsule asymmetries.

asymptotically hyperbolic if it (and only if) possesses a CMC-cover satisfying
certain geometric curvature estimates, a uniqueness property, and each surface
has controlled instability. As toy application of these geometric

contact process (CP) with a competitive dynamics in bipartite sublattices,
proposed in [Phys. Rev. E 84, 011125 (2011)]. The particle creation depends on
its first and second neighbors and the extinction increases according to the
local density. In contrast to the standard CP model, mean-field theory and
numerical simulations predict three stable phases: inactive (absorbing), active
symmetric and active asymmetric, signed by distinct sublattice particle
occupations. Our results from MFT and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low
diffusion rates do not destroy sublattice ordering, ensuring the maintenance of
the asymmetric phase. On the other hand, for diffusion larger than a threshold
value Dc, the sublattice ordering is suppressed and only the usual active

of the molecular cloud G35.20$-$0.74 (hereafter MCG35.2) using multi-frequency
observations. The MCG35.2 is depicted in a velocity range of 30-40 km s$^{-1}$.
An almost horseshoe-like structure embedded within the MCG35.2 is evident in
the infrared and millimeter images and harbors the previously known sites,
ultra-compact/hyper-compact G35.20$-$0.74N H\,{\sc ii} region, Ap2-1, and
Mercer 14 at its base. The site, Ap2-1 is found to be excited by a radio
spectral type of B0.5V star where the distribution of 20 cm and H$\alpha$
emission is surrounded by the extended molecular hydrogen emission. Using the
{\it Herschel} 160-500 $\mu$m and photometric 1-24 $\mu$m data analysis,
several embedded clumps and clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) are
investigated within the MCG35.2, revealing the SF activities. Majority of the
YSOs clusters and massive clumps (500-4250 M$_{\odot}$) are seen toward the
horseshoe-like structure. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO emission
shows a blue-shifted peak (at 33 km s$^{-1}$) and a red-shifted peak (at 37 km
s$^{-1}$) interconnected by lower intensity intermediated velocity emission,
tracing a broad bridge feature. The presence of such broad bridge feature
suggests the onset of a collision between molecular components in the MCG35.2.
A noticeable change in the H-band starlight mean polarization angles has also
been observed in the MCG35.2, probably tracing the interaction between
molecular components. Taken together, it seems that the cloud-cloud collision
process has influenced the birth of massive stars and YSOs clusters in the
MCG35.2.

the current work, we present a refinement of the classical `magneto-dipolar'
formula for pulsar magnetic fields $B_{\rm md} = (3.2\times 10^{19}\mbox{

of state (EOS) of dense matter, the individual pulsar obliquity $\alpha$ and
the mass $M$. Adopting state-of-the-art statistics for $M$ and $\alpha$ we
calculate the distributions of $\Delta_{\rm B}$ for a representative subset of
22 EOSs that do not contradict observations. It has been found that
$\Delta_{\rm B}$ is distributed nearly normally, with the average in the range
-0.5 to -0.25 dex and standard deviation $\sigma[\Delta_{\rm B}] \approx$ 0.06
to 0.09 dex, depending on the adopted EOS. The latter quantity represents a
formal uncertainty of the corrected estimation of $\log B$ because $\Delta_{\rm
B}$ is weakly correlated with $\log B_{\rm md}$. At the same time, if it is
assumed that every considered EOS has the same chance of occurring in nature,
then another, more generalized, estimator $B^* \approx 3B_{\rm md}/7$ can be
introduced providing an unbiased value of the pulsar surface magnetic field
with $\sim$30 per cent uncertainty with 68 per cent confidence. Finally, we

The principal finding of this work is that the central regions of NGC 4501 are
dominated by non circular motions connected to probable outflows of matter from
the nuclear regions of this galaxy. A predominant old stellar population
inhabits the internal zones of NGC 4501 excluding the possibility of ongoing
starburst activity in the central parsecs of this galaxy. The latter result is
confirmed by the diagnostic diagram analysis that establishes a preponderant
active galactic nucleus character for NGC 4501. These outcomes together provide
a general description of the gas motion and the corresponding nuclear activity

involve the transport of a number of (electro-)chemical species through

paper, we study a model problem motivated by a solar-driven thermochemical
conversion device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. We formulate the
problem as a system of coupled multi-material reaction-diffusion equations
where each species diffuses selectively through a given material and where the
reaction occurs at multi-material interfaces. We express the problem of optimal
design of the material arrangement as a saddle point problem and obtain an
effective functional which shows that regions with very fine phase mixtures of
the material arise naturally. To explore this further, we introduce a
phase-field formulation of the optimal design problem, and numerically study

is described by a Markov process in two dimensions. But even though there
exists a variety of techniques for the analysis of Markov processes, it is
still a challenge to estimate the process parameters solely based on a given
time series of $X$. Such a partially observed 2D-process could, e.g., be
analyzed in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
Alternatively, an embedding strategy can be applied, where first the joint

the results can be used to determine the process parameters of $X$ and $\eta$.
In this paper, we propose a more direct approach that is purely based on the
moments of the increments of $X$, which can be estimated for different
time-increments $\tau$ from a given time series. From a stochastic
Taylor-expansion of $X$, analytic expressions for these moments can be derived,
which can be used to estimate the process parameters by a regression strategy.

is fundamental to problems in several fields, including probabilistic learning,
network theory, and data analysis. Classification and prediction are the two
faces of this class of problem. We take an approach here that simplifies many
aspects of these problems by presenting a structured, series expansion of the
Kullback-Leibler divergence - a function central to information theory - and
devise a distance metric based on this divergence. Using the M\""obius inversion
duality between multivariable entropies and multivariable interaction
information, we express the divergence as an additive series in the number of
interacting variables, which provides a restricted and simplified set of
distributions to use as approximation and with which to model data. Truncations
of this series yield approximations based on the number of interacting
variables. The first few terms of the expansion-truncation are illustrated and
shown to lead naturally to familiar approximations, including the well-known
Kirkwood superposition approximation. Truncation can also induce a simple
relation between the multi-information and the interaction information. A
measure of distance between distributions, based on Kullback-Leibler
divergence, is then described and shown to be a true metric if properly
restricted. The expansion is shown to generate a hierarchy of metrics and
connects this work to information geometry formalisms. We give an example of
the application of these metrics to a graph comparision problem that shows that
the formalism can be applied to a wide range of network problems, provides a
general approach for systematic approximations in numbers of interactions or
connections, and a related quantitative metric.

find that the photo-generated charge carriers, which accumulate near the (001)
surface, have a similar depth profile and sheet carrier concentration as the
confined electrons that were previously observed in LAO/STO (001)
heterostructures. A large fraction of these photo-generated charge carriers
persist at low temperature at the STO (001) surface even after the UV light has
been switched off again. These persistent charge carriers seem to originate
from oxygen vacancies that are trapped at the structural domain boundaries
which develop below the so-called antiferrodistortive transition at T* = 105 K.
This is most evident from a corresponding photo-doping study of the DC
transport in STO (110) crystals for which the concentration of these domain
boundaries can be modified by applying a weak uniaxial stress. The oxygen
vacancies and their trapping by defects are also the source of the electrons
that are confined to the interface of LAO/STO (110) heterostructures which
likely do not have a polar discontinuity as in LAO/STO (001). In the former,
the trapping and clustering of the oxygen vacancies also has a strong influence
on the anisotropy of the charge carrier mobility. We show that this anisotropy
can be readily varied and even inverted by various means, such as a gentle
thermal treatment, UV irradiation, or even a weak uniaxial stress. Our
experiments suggest that extended defects, which develop over long time periods
(of weeks to months), can strongly influence the response of the confined
charge carriers at the LAO/STO (110) interface.

find and analyze the cores of singular vortices with non-Abelian charges in the
point-group symmetry of a spin-3 $^{52}$Cr condensate. Using a simpler model
system, we analyze the underlying dipolar physics and show how a characteristic
length scale arising from the magnetic dipolar coupling interacts with the
hierarchy of healing lengths of the s-wave scattering, and leads to simple
criteria for the core structure: When the interactions both energetically favor
the ground-state spin condition, such as in the spin-1 ferromagnetic phase, the
size of singular vortices is restricted to the shorter spin-dependent healing
length. Conversely, when the interactions compete (e.g., in the spin-1 polar
phase), we find that the core of a singular vortex is enlarged by increasing
dipolar coupling. We further demonstrate how the spin-alignment arising from
the interaction anisotropy is manifest in the appearance of a ground-state
spin-vortex line that is oriented perpendicularly to the condensate axis of
rotation, as well as in potentially observable internal core spin textures. We
also explain how it leads to interaction-dependent angular momentum in
nonsingular vortices as a result of competition with rotation-induced spin
ordering. When the anisotropy is modified by a strong magnetic field, we show
how it gives rise to a symmetry-breaking deformation of a vortex core into a

framework of the proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle time-blocking
approximation (pn-RQTBA). Based on the Covariant Density Functional Theory,
this method extends the proton-neutron Relativistic Quasiparticle Random-Phase
Approximation (pn-RQRPA) by including the coupling between single
quasiparticles and collective nuclear vibrations. In the charge-exchange
channel, this coupling generates a time-dependent effective interaction between
proton and neutron quasiparticles. The particle-hole component of this
interaction adds to the static pion and rho-meson exchange, while the
particle-particle component provides a microscopic and consistent
proton-neutron pairing interaction. We find that such dynamical effects induce
fragmentation and spreading of the Gamow-Teller transition strength which are
important for a better agreement with the experimental measurements and for an
accurate description of $\beta$-decay rates. The new developments include the
coupling of single nucleons to isospin-flip vibrations in doubly-magic nuclei.
We find that these phonons can have a non-negligible effect on $\beta$-decay
half-lives and ""quenching"" of the strength.

important yet challenging problem for medical image analysis. Specifically, the
pancreas demonstrates very high inter-patient anatomical variability in both
its shape and volume. In this paper, we present an automated system using 3D
computed tomography (CT) volumes via a two-stage cascaded approach: pancreas
localization and segmentation. For the first step, we localize the pancreas
from the entire 3D CT scan, providing a reliable bounding box for the more
refined segmentation step. We introduce a fully deep-learning approach, based
on an efficient application of holistically-nested convolutional networks
(HNNs) on the three orthogonal axial, sagittal, and coronal views. The
resulting HNN per-pixel probability maps are then fused using pooling to
reliably produce a 3D bounding box of the pancreas that maximizes the recall.
We show that our introduced localizer compares favorably to both a conventional
non-deep-learning method and a recent hybrid approach based on spatial
aggregation of superpixels using random forest classification. The second,
segmentation, phase operates within the computed bounding box and integrates
semantic mid-level cues of deeply-learned organ interior and boundary maps,
obtained by two additional and separate realizations of HNNs. By integrating
these two mid-level cues, our method is capable of generating
boundary-preserving pixel-wise class label maps that result in the final
pancreas segmentation. Quantitative evaluation is performed on a publicly
available dataset of 82 patient CT scans using 4-fold cross-validation (CV). We
achieve a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 81.27+/-6.27% in validation,
which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the art methods that report
DSCs of 71.80+/-10.70% and 78.01+/-8.20%, respectively, using the same dataset.

received sequentially (data stream). For real life data streams, the
distribution of the data typically varies with time making estimation of
quantiles challenging. We present a method that simultaneously maintain
estimates of multiple quantiles of the data stream distribution. The method is
based on making incremental updates of the quantile estimates every time a new
sample from the data stream is received. The method is memory and
computationally efficient since it only stores one value for each quantile
estimate and only performs one operation per quantile estimate when a new
sample is received from the data stream. The estimates are realistic in the
sense that the monotone property of quantiles is satisfied in every iteration.
Experiments show that the method efficiently tracks multiple quantiles and
outperforms state of the art methods.

in several applications in nuclear reactor physics and more generally in
diffusion phenomena emerging in optics and life sciences. Exact solutions for
the ensemble-averaged physical observables are hardly available, and several
approximate models have been thus developed, providing a compromise between the
accurate treatment of the disorder-induced spatial correlations and the
computational time. In order to validate these models, it is mandatory to
resort to reference solutions in benchmark configurations, typically obtained
by explicitly generating by Monte Carlo methods several realizations of random
media, simulating particle transport in each realization, and finally taking
the ensemble averages for the quantities of interest. In this context, intense
research efforts have been devoted to Poisson (Markov) mixing statistics, where
benchmark solutions have been derived for transport in one-dimensional
geometries. In a recent work, we have generalized these solutions to two and
three-dimensional configurations, and shown how dimension affects the
simulation results. In this paper we will examine the impact of mixing
statistics: to this aim, we will compare the reflection and transmission
probabilities, as well as the particle flux, for three-dimensional random media
obtained by resorting to Poisson, Voronoi and Box stochastic tessellations. For
each tessellation, we will furthermore discuss the effects of varying the

Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which wires the dormant spinning black holes as

photonuclear interactions on the ambient photon fields. We argue that the local
dark fossils of the past quasar activity can be classified on the basis of how
source parameters (mass of the central engine and photon background surrounding
the accelerator) impact the photonuclear interaction. In this classification it
is possible to distinguish two unequivocal type of sources: those in which
nuclei are completely photodisintegrated before escaping the acceleration
region and those in which photopion production is the major energy damping
mechanism. We further argue that the secondary nucleons from the
photodisintegrated nuclei (which have a steep spectral index at injection) can
populate the energy region below ""the ankle"" feature in the cosmic ray
spectrum, whereas heavy and medium mass nuclei (with a harder spectral index)
populate the energy region beyond ""the ankle"", all the way to the high energy
end of the spectrum. In addition, we show that five potential quasar remnants

with median stellar masses ranging from ~10^9 Msun for clumps in the
often-referenced field galaxies to ~10^7 Msun for fainter clumps selected in
deep-field or lensed galaxies. We argue that the clump masses, observed in
non-lensed galaxies with a limited spatial resolution of ~1 kpc, are
artificially increased due to the clustering of clumps of smaller mass.
Furthermore, we show that the sensitivity threshold used for the clump
selection affects the inferred masses even more strongly than resolution,
biasing clumps at the low mass end. Both improved spatial resolution and
sensitivity appear to shift the clump stellar mass distribution to lower
masses, qualitatively in agreement with clump masses found in recent
high-resolution simulations of disk fragmentation. We discuss the nature of the
most massive clumps, and we conclude that it is currently not possible to
properly establish a meaningful clump stellar mass distribution from
observations and to infer the existence and value of a characteristic clump
mass scale.

flow by maintaining a constant divergence. However, optical flow is typically
estimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This
requires processing full images on-board, limiting the update rate of
divergence measurements, and thus the speed of the control loop and the robot.
Event-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level
brightness changes at microsecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an
efficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This paper presents, to the
best of our knowledge, the first work integrating event-based optical flow
estimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing
'local plane fitting' algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally
efficient optical flow estimation method, valid for a wide range of optical
flow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In
addition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow
is introduced, which accounts for the aperture problem. The developed
algorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller on-board
of a quadrotor. Experiments show that, using event-based optical flow, accurate
divergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables
the quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.

""domain wall"" or a ""solitonic structure"" of the pairing field in the neck
region, which hinders energy dissipation as well as the neck formation, leading
to significant changes of the reaction dynamics. The situation nicely mimics
the one extensively studied experimentally with ultracold atomic gases, where
two clouds of superfluid atoms possessing different phases of the pairing field
are forced to merge, creating various topological excitations, quantum vortices
and solitons, as well as Josephson currents. In this paper, we present
unpublished results for a lighter system, namely, $^{44}$Ca+$^{44}$Ca. It is
shown that the pairing effects on the fusion hindrance are rather small in
lighter systems, due to a strong tendency towards fusion, which is consistent
with an earlier study.

remanent magnetization (VRM) in an ensemble of cubic magnetite pseudo
single-domain particles is presented. This is achieved by developing a fast
relaxation algorithm for finding optimal transition paths between micromagnetic
local energy minima. It combines a nudged elastic band technique with action
minimization. Initial paths are obtained by repetitive minimizations of
modified energy functions. For a cubic pseudo-single domain particle, 60
different local energy minima are identified and all optimal energy barriers
between them are numerically calculated for zero external field. The results
allow to estimate also the energy barriers in in weak external fields which are
necessary to construct the time dependent transition matrices which describe
the continuous homogeneous Markov processes of VRM acquisition and decay. By
spherical averaging the remanence acquisition in an isotropic PSD ensemble was
calculated over all time scales. The modelled particle ensemble shows a
physically meaningful overshooting during VRM acquisition. The results also
explain why VRM acquisition in PSD particles can occur much faster than VRM
decay and therefore can explain for findings of extremely stable VRM in some
paleomagnetic studies.

recurrent neural networks for tasks that exhibit long term dependencies. The
vanishing or exploding gradient problem is a well known issue associated with
these challenges. One approach to addressing vanishing and exploding gradients
is to use either soft or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to encourage
or enforce orthogonality. Orthogonal matrices preserve gradient norm during
backpropagation and may therefore be a desirable property. This paper explores
issues with optimization convergence, speed and gradient stability when
encouraging or enforcing orthogonality. To perform this analysis, we propose a
weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy through which we can
bound matrix norms and therein control the degree of expansivity induced during
backpropagation. We find that hard constraints on orthogonality can negatively
affect the speed of convergence and model performance.

self-consistent disk reflection model suggests the accretion disk is viewed at
an intermediate angle with a super-solar iron abundance, and a mild constraint
can be put on the high-energy cutoff of the power-law continuum. We test the

emerging collective behavior in socio-economic and life sciences are presented.

be useful laboratories to test theories from stellar evolution to cosmology. In
this paper, we present a new method to estimate the absolute age of a globular
cluster from observations of its brown dwarfs. The transition region between
the end of the main sequence and the brown dwarf regime is characterized by a
dearth of objects as function of magnitude. The brightest of the cooling brown
dwarfs is easily identified by an increase in density in the color-magnitude
diagram as you go fainter in magnitudes, and these brightest brown dwarfs get
fainter with age. By identifying the brightest brown dwarfs, it is thus
possible to determine the age of a globular cluster within a 1 Gyr precision
with four-sigma confidence. This new method, which is independent of current
methods of age estimation and which does not rely on the knowledge of the
cluster's distance from Earth, will become feasible thanks to the high spatial
resolution and incredible infrared sensitivity of the James Webb Space

through evolution a protection mechanism, called bet-hedging, to increase their
probability of survival under stressful environmental fluctutation. In this
context, the concept of preadaptation refers to a common type of bet-hedging
protection strategy in which a relatively small number of individuals in a
population stochastically switch their phenotypes to a `dormant' metabolic
state in which they increase their probability of survival against potential
environmental shocks. Hence, if an environmental shock took place at some point
in time, preadapted organisms would be better adapted to survive and
proliferate once the shock is over. In many biological populations, the
mechanisms of preadaptation and proliferation present delays whose influence in
the fitness of the population are not well-understood. In this paper, we
propose a rigorous mathematical framework to analyze the role of delays in both
preadaptation and proliferation mechanisms in the survival of biological
populations, with an emphasis on bacterial colonies. Our theoretical framework
allows us to analytically quantify the average growth rate of a bet-hedging
bacterial colony with stochastically delayed reactions with arbitrary
precision. We verify the accuracy of the proposed method by numerical
simulations and conclude that the growth rate of a bet-hedging population shows
a non-trivial dependency on their preadaptation and proliferation delays.
Contrary to the current belief, our results show that faster reactions do not,
in general, increase the overall fitness of a biological population.

increase, which is shown by numerical analyses to correspond to inter-node
excitonic fluctuations, precursor of a transition from massless to massive

attention in remote sensing area due to its importance in improving the HSI
qualities. The existing HSI denoising methods mainly focus on specific spectral
and spatial prior knowledge in HSIs, and share a common underlying assumption
that the embedded noise in HSI is independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.). In real scenarios, however, the noise existed in a natural HSI is
always with much more complicated non-i.i.d. statistical structures and the
under-estimation to this noise complexity often tends to evidently degenerate
the robustness of current methods. To alleviate this issue, this paper attempts
the first effort to model the HSI noise using a non-i.i.d. mixture of Gaussians
(NMoG) noise assumption, which is finely in accordance with the noise
characteristics possessed by a natural HSI and thus is capable of adapting
various noise shapes encountered in real applications. Then we integrate such
noise modeling strategy into the low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) model and
propose a NMoG-LRMF model in the Bayesian framework. A variational Bayes
algorithm is designed to infer the posterior of the proposed model. All
involved parameters can be recursively updated in closed-form. Compared with
the current techniques, the proposed method performs more robust beyond the
state-of-the-arts, as substantiated by our experiments implemented on synthetic
and real noisy HSIs.

human-factors variability and improve throughput. Simple methods based on peak
amplitude in an image are sometimes employed and a trained-operator-controlled
refinement that uses a dynamic threshold based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
has also been implemented. We develop an automated and optimized detection
procedure that mimics these operations. The primary goal of our methodology is
to reduce the number of images requiring expert visual evaluation by filtering
out images that are overwhelmingly definitive on the existence or absence of a

identified the large-scale structures across a $\sim$50 comoving Mpc scale
traced by Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in which the protocluster traced by the
HAEs is embedded. On a smaller scale, however, there are remarkably few LAEs in
the regions of HAE overdensities. Moreover, the stacking analyses of the images
show that HAEs in higher-density regions show systematically lower escape
fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons than those of HAEs in lower-density regions.
These phenomena may be driven by the extra depletion of Ly$\alpha$ emission
lines along our line of sight by more intervening cold
circumgalactic/intergalactic medium and/or dust existing in the dense core. We
also caution that all the past high-$z$ protocluster surveys using LAEs as the

shown to be independent of the degree of pulse overlap and thereby the
intermittency of the stochastic process. For constant pulse duration and a
one-sided exponential pulse shape, the power spectral density has a Lorentzian
shape which is flat for low frequencies and a power law at high frequencies.
The algebraic tail is demonstrated to result from the discontinuity in the
pulse function. For a strongly asymmetric two-sided exponential pulse shape,
the frequency spectrum is a broken power law with two scaling regions. In the
case of a symmetric pulse shape, the power spectral density is the square of a
Lorentzian function. The steep algebraic tail at high frequencies in these
cases is demonstrated to follow from the discontinuity in the derivative of the
pulse function. A random distribution of pulse durations is shown to result in
apparently longer correlation times but has no influence on the asymptotic
power law tail of the frequency spectrum. The effect of additional random noise
is also discussed, leading to a flat spectrum for high frequencies. The
probability density function for the fluctuations is shown to be independent of
the distribution of pulse durations. The predictions of this model describe the
variety of auto-correlation functions and power spectral densities reported
from experimental measurements in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined

practical problems, Phaseless Compressed Sensing (PCS) has been introduced and
studied recently. Many theoretical results have been obtained for PCS with the
aid of its convex relaxation. Motivated by successful applications of nonconvex
relaxed methods for solving compressive sensing, in this paper, we try to
investigate PCS via its nonconvex relaxation. Specifically, we relax PCS in the
real context by the corresponding $\ell_p$-minimization with $p\in (0,1)$. We
show that there exists a constant $p^\ast\in (0,1]$ such that for any fixed
$p\in(0, p^\ast)$, every optimal solution to the $\ell_p$-minimization also
solves the concerned problem; and derive an expression of such a constant
$p^\ast$ by making use of the known data and the sparsity level of the
concerned problem. These provide a theoretical basis for solving this class of
problems via the corresponding $\ell_p$-minimization.

developments of relevance for the NICA facility under construction. In a first
part, I discuss new aspects of the QCD phase diagram like the possible
existence of a critical endpoint of first-order phase transitions from the
perspective of generalizations of the 3-flavor PNJL model including the
conjecture of a universal pressure for the onset of deconfinement in heavy-ion
collisions and astrophysics. A second part is devoted to first results of the
newly constructed event simulator (THESEUS) which is based on the
particlization of the former three-fluid hydrodynamics code by Ivanov, Russkikh
and Toneev that allows also to study the role of hadronic final state
interactions. Possible signals of the mixed phase accessible at NICA are
considered. In particular, the robustness of the baryon-stopping signal of
deconfinement and the occurrence of antiflow for protons have been investigated
for Au+Au collisions in the range of the NICA-MPD energy scan for $\sqrt{s}
\sim 6 \dots 8$ GeV. This signal is reflected also in the flow pattern of light
nuclear clusters, in particular deuterons. The sharp peak for the $K^+/\pi^+$
ratio at $\sqrt{s} \sim 8$ GeV (the ""horn"" effect) is not obtained in the
present version of THESEUS and calls for improvement of the equation of state
input. I report the recent progress in developing a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck
approach to a unified description of quark-hadron matter which includes now
strangeness and reveals a new mechanism for explaining the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio

consider a more practical scenario where mobile devices and static FAPs, each
having a finite-size cache space, are able to cache a subset of content objects
so that each request is served by other mobile devices or static FAPs. Under a
general multihop-based content delivery protocol, we analyze the order-optimal
throughput--delay trade-off by presenting a new cache allocation strategy. In
particular, under a given caching strategy, we first characterize a
throughput--delay trade-off in terms of scaling laws along with the general
content delivery multihop routing protocol. Then, the order-optimal
throughput--delay trade-off is characterized by presenting the order-optimal
cache allocation strategy, which jointly finds the replication sets at mobile
devices and static FAPs via a novel variable decoupling approach. In our mobile
IoT network, an interesting observation is that highly popular content objects
are mainly served by mobile devices while the rest of content objects are
served by static FAPs. We perform numerical evaluation to validate our
analytical results. We also show that the order-optimal strategy strictly
outperforms a baseline approach, where the replication sets at mobile devices

in a metric setting. Visco-Energetic solutions have been recently obtained by
passing to the time-continuous limit in a time-incremental scheme, akin to that
for Energetic solutions, but perturbed by a `viscous' correction term, as in
the case of Balanced Viscosity solutions. However, for Visco-Energetic
solutions this viscous correction is tuned by a fixed parameter $\mu$. The
resulting solution notion is characterized by a stability condition and an
energy balance analogous to those for Energetic solutions, but, in addition, it
provides a fine description of the system behavior at jumps as Balanced
Viscosity solutions do. Visco-Energetic evolution can be thus thought as
`in-between' Energetic and Balanced Viscosity evolution. Here we aim to
formalize this intermediate character of Visco-Energetic solutions by studying
their singular limits as $\mu\downarrow 0$ and $\mu\uparrow \infty$. We shall
prove convergence to Energetic solutions in the former case, and to Balanced
Viscosity solutions in the latter situation.

$A^t = A + tE$, $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are eigenvalues of $A$ in descending
order, and $u_1, u^t_1$ are leading eigenvectors of $A$ and $A^t$.
Rayleigh-Schr\""{o}dinger theory shows asymptotically, $\langle u^t_1, u_j

asymptotic theory does not apply to larger $t$; in particular, it fails when $
t \| E \|_2 > \lambda_1 - \lambda_2$. In this paper, we present a nonasymptotic
theory with $E$ being a random matrix. We prove that, when $t = 1$ and $E$ has
independent and centered subgaussian entries above its diagonal, with high
probability, \begin{equation*} | \langle u^1_1, u_j \rangle | = O(\sqrt{\log n}

a condition on eigenvalues of $A$ that involves all gaps $\lambda_1 -
\lambda_j$. This bound is valid, even in cases where $\| E \|_2 \gg \lambda_1 -
\lambda_2$. The result is optimal, except for a log term. It also leads to an
improvement of Davis-Kahan theorem.

concerns with the question of whether a locally definable distributed computing
problem can be solved locally: for a given local CSP whether a CSP solution can
be constructed by a distributed algorithm using local information. In this
paper, we consider the problem of sampling a uniform CSP solution by
distributed algorithms, and ask whether a locally definable joint distribution
can be sampled from locally. More broadly, we consider sampling from Gibbs
distributions induced by weighted local CSPs in the LOCAL model.
  We give two Markov chain based distributed algorithms which we believe to
represent two fundamental approaches for sampling from Gibbs distributions via
distributed algorithms. The first algorithm generically parallelizes the
single-site sequential Markov chain by iteratively updating a random
independent set of variables in parallel, and achieves an $O(\Delta\log n)$
time upper bound in the LOCAL model, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree, when
the Dobrushin's condition for the Gibbs distribution is satisfied. The second
algorithm is a novel parallel Markov chain which proposes to update all
variables simultaneously yet still guarantees to converge correctly with no
bias. It surprisingly parallelizes an intrinsically sequential process:
stabilizing to a joint distribution with massive local dependencies, and may
achieve an optimal $O(\log n)$ time upper bound independent of the maximum
degree $\Delta$ under a stronger mixing condition.
  We also show a strong $\Omega(diam)$ lower bound for sampling independent set
in graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 6$. This lower bound holds even when
every node is aware of the graph. This gives a strong separation between
sampling and constructing locally checkable labelings.

random access memory (MRAM). The effective manipulation of SOT has thus become
an important step towards these applications. Here, current induced spin-orbit
effective fields and magnetization switching are investigated in
Pt/Ta/CoFeB/MgO structures with bilayer heavy metals. With a fixed thickness (1
nm) of the Ta layer, the magnitude and sign of current induced spin-orbit
effective fields can be continuously tuned by changing the Pt layer thickness,
consistent with the current induced magnetization switching data. The ratio of
longitudinal to transverse spin-orbit effective fields is found to be
determined by the Ta/CoFeB interface and can be continuously tuned by changing
the Pt layer thickness. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to
be weak and shows an insignificant variation with the Pt thickness. The results
demonstrate an effective method to tune SOTs utilizing bilayer heavy metals
without affecting the DMI, a desirable feature which will be useful for the

stochastic machines fail to generate directed motion. Initially derived for
single particle systems, the no-pumping theorem was recently extended to
many-particle systems with zero-range interactions. Interestingly, it is known
that the theorem is violated by systems with exclusion interactions. These two
paradigmatic interactions differ by two qualitative aspects: the range of
interactions, and the dependence of branching fractions on the state of the
system. In this work two different models are studied in order to identify the
qualitative property of the interaction that leads to breakdown of no-pumping.
A model with finite-range interaction is shown analytically to satisfy
no-pumping. In contrast, a model in which the interaction affects the
probabilities of reaching different sites, given that a particle is making a
transition, is shown numerically to violate the no-pumping theorem. The results
suggest that systems with interactions that lead to state-dependent branching
fractions do not satisfy the no-pumping theorem.

The phenomenon is derived for Kuramoto model of N identical phase oscillators

was proposed aiming at simple implementation, but it can tolerate only a small
disturbance in a quantum channel. The round-robin DPS (RRDPS) protocol could be
a good solution for this problem, which in fact can tolerate even up to $50\%$
of a bit error rate. Unfortunately, however, such a high tolerance can be
achieved only when we compromise the simplicity, i.e., Bob's measurement must
involve a large number of random delays ($|\mathcal{R}|$ denotes its number),
and in a practical regime of $|\mathcal{R}|$ being small, the tolerance is low.
In this paper, we propose a new DPS protocol to achieve a higher tolerance than
the one in the original DPS protocol, in which the measurement setup is less
demanding than the one of the RRDPS protocol for the high tolerance regime. We
call the new protocol the small-number-random DPS (SNRDPS) protocol, and in
this protocol, we add only a small amount of randomness to the original DPS
protocol, i.e., $2\leq|\mathcal{R}|\leq10$. In fact, we found that the
performance of the SNRDPS protocol is significantly enhanced over the original
DPS protocol only by employing a few additional delays such as
$|\mathcal{R}|=2$. Also, we found that the key generation rate of the SNRDPS
protocol outperforms the RRDPS protocol without monitoring the bit error rate
when it is less than $5\%$ and $|\mathcal{R}|\leq10$. Our protocol is an
intermediate protocol between the original DPS protocol and the RRDPS protocol,
and it increases the variety of the DPS-type protocols with quantified
security.

sensitive content on Twitter. One natural approach to this problem is to first
create a list of sensitive keywords, and then identify Twitter accounts that
use these words in their tweets. But such an approach may overlook sensitive
accounts that are not covered by the subjective choice of keywords. In this
paper, we instead explore finding sensitive accounts by examining the
percentage of anonymous and identifiable followers the accounts have. This
approach is motivated by an earlier study showing that sensitive accounts
typically have a large percentage of anonymous followers and a small percentage
of identifiable followers.
  To this end, we first considered the problem of automatically determining if
a Twitter account is anonymous or identifiable. We find that simple techniques,
such as checking for name-list membership, perform poorly. We designed a
machine learning classifier that classifies accounts as anonymous or
identifiable. We then classified an account as sensitive based on the
percentages of anonymous and identifiable followers the account has. We applied
our approach to approximately 100,000 accounts with 404 million active
followers. The approach uncovered accounts that were sensitive for a diverse
number of reasons. These accounts span across varied themes, including those
that are not commonly proposed as sensitive or those that relate to socially
stigmatized topics. To validate our approach, we applied Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) topic analysis to the tweets in the detected sensitive and
non-sensitive accounts. LDA showed that the sensitive and non-sensitive
accounts obtained from the methodology are tweeting about distinctly different
topics. Our results show that it is indeed possible to objectively identify
sensitive accounts at the scale of Twitter.

challenging because of the inherent implicit knowledge within the patients'
medical records and queries. Such knowledge is known to the medical
practitioners but may be hidden from a search system. For example, when
searching for the patients with a heart disease, medical practitioners commonly
know that patients who are taking the amiodarone medicine are relevant, since
this drug is used to combat heart disease. In this article, we argue that
leveraging such implicit knowledge improves the retrieval effectiveness, since
it provides new evidence to infer the relevance of patients' medical records
towards a query. Specifically, built upon existing conceptual representation
for both medical records and queries, we proposed a novel expansion of queries
that infers additional conceptual relationships from domain-specific resources
as well as by extracting informative concepts from the top-ranked patients'
medical records. We evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of our proposed
approach in the context of the TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records track. Our
results show the effectiveness of our approach to model the implicit knowledge
in patient search, whereby the retrieval performance is significantly improved
over both an effective conceptual representation baseline and an existing
semantic query expansion baseline. In addition, we provide an analysis of the
types of queries that the proposed approach is likely to be effective.

eigenvalue spectra. In this work two one-dimensional systems with two different
topological phases, the topological nontrivial Phase (TNP) and the topological
trivial phase (TTP) combined with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian
potentials are investigated. The models of choice are the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) model and the Kitaev chain. The interplay of a spontaneous
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking due to gain and loss with the topological
phase is different for the two models. The SSH model undergoes a
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition in the TNP immediately with the
presence of a non-vanishing gain and loss strength $\gamma$, whereas the TTP
exhibits a parameter regime in which a purely real eigenvalue spectrum exists.
For the Kitaev chain the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking is independent of the
topological phase. We show that the topological interesting states -- the edge
states -- are the reason for the different behaviors of the two models and that
the intrinsic particle-hole symmetry of the edge states in the Kitaev chain is
responsible for a conservation of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in the TNP.

turn a PCA into an auto-encoder, by generating an encoder layer of the PCA

chord preditions from acoustic models. Traditionally, first-order models such
as Hidden Markov Models were used for this task, with recent works suggesting
to apply Recurrent Neural Networks instead. Due to their ability to learn
longer-term dependencies, these models are supposed to learn and to apply
musical knowledge, instead of just smoothing the output of the acoustic model.
In this paper, we argue that learning complex temporal models at the level of
audio frames is futile on principle, and that non-Markovian models do not
perform better than their first-order counterparts. We support our argument
through three experiments on the McGill Billboard dataset. The first two show
1) that when learning complex temporal models at the frame level, improvements
in chord sequence modelling are marginal; and 2) that these improvements do not
translate when applied within a full chord recognition system. The third, still
rather preliminary experiment gives first indications that the use of complex
sequential models for chord prediction at higher temporal levels might be more
promising.

a phenotypical trait that governs the spatial diffusion. We are concerned with
the case when the diffusivity can take unbounded values and the mortality

identify two regimes, an acceleration regime when the penalization is weak and
a linear spreading regime when the penalization is strong. While the

routing centralization approaches, based on Software Defined Networking (SDN),
have been recently proposed. Initial studies show that these approaches can
significantly improve performance and routing control over BGP. In this paper,
we complement existing system-oriented works, by analytically studying the
gains of inter-domain SDN. We propose a probabilistic framework to analyse the
effects of centralization on the inter-domain routing performance. We derive
bounds for the time needed to establish data plane connectivity between ASes
after a routing change, as well as predictions for the control-plane

chromatograph and mass spectrometer Ptolemy. On 12 to 14 November 2014 both
instruments measured the organic composition of the comet nucleus material
through seven measurements in sniffing mode during Philae's hopping and at its
final landing site Abydos. We compare the temporal evolution of intensities of
several ion species identified by both mass spectrometers. For COSAC this is
the first analysis of the temporal behaviour of the measured ion species. All
ion species showed the highest intensities in the first spectra measured by
both instruments about 20 to 30 minutes after Philae's first touchdown at
Agilkia, and a decay during the six consecutive measurements at Abydos. Both
instruments measured a nearly identical decay of the water peak (m/z 18), and
also CO (m/z 28) behaved similarly. In the COSAC measurements the peak at m/z
44 decays much slower than all the other ion species, including the water peak.
In particular, the m/z 44 peak decays much slower in the COSAC measurements
than in the Ptolemy data. This supports our earlier interpretation that COSAC
for the first time analyzed a regolith sample from a cometary nucleus in situ,
while Ptolemy measured cometary gas from the ambient coma. The m/z 44 peak
measured by COSAC was likely dominated by organic species, whereas the peak
measured by Ptolemy was interpreted to be mostly due to $CO_2$. Ion species
heavier than m/z 30 tend to decay somewhat slower in the COSAC measurements

missing observationally. Although previous numerical simulations have indicated
that most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of
Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect
signatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine
transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the
WHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using
the data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation
project, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and
thermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the
constructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square
Kilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the
21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are
detectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of
\Delta\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours. However,
it also turns out that the signals mainly come from galaxies residing in the
filamentary structures and the contribution from the WHIM is too small to
detect with the SKA1-mid. Our results suggest that about 10 times higher
sensitivity than the SKA1-mid is possibly enough to detect the WHIM at z=0.5-3.

arise from contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks
at [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively. From consideration of the absolute

highlights the surprising power of a broadcast channel for clustering problems;
roughly speaking, to spectrally cluster $n$ points or $n$ vertices in a graph
distributed across $s$ servers, for a worst-case partitioning the communication
complexity in a point-to-point model is $n \cdot s$, while in the broadcast

well. We implement our algorithms and demonstrate this phenomenon on real life

explains the contraction of coronal loops in the proximity of the flare sites,

  We find that two vorticity arcs located along the flanks of the erupting

arcades above the flux-rope legs are then subjected to expansion, rotation or
contraction depending on which part of the vortex-flow advects them. In
addition to the vortices, an inward-directed magnetic pressure gradient exists
in the current sheet below the magnetic flux rope. It results in the formation
of a sink that is maintained by reconnection.
  We conclude that coronal loop apparent implosions observed during eruptive

vortex- and sink-flows when a flux rope moves in a magnetized environment.

backbone contribute significantly to the stiffness of DNA. This elastic

by measuring the mechanical properties of DNA bound with small ligands. When a
ds-DNA molecule is overstretched in the presence of ligands, it undergoes a
co-operative structural transition based on the externally applied force, the
mode of binding of the ligands, the binding constant of the ligands to the DNA,
the concentration of the ligands and the ionic strength of the supporting
medium. This leads to the changes in the regions- upto 60 pN, cooperative
structural transition region and the overstretched region, compared to that of
the FEC in the absence of any binding ligand. The cooperative structural
transitions were studied by the extended and twistable worm-like chain model.
Here we have depicted these changes in persistence length and the elastic
modulus constant as a function of binding constant and the concentration of the

analysis of network data. This model assumes that there is an underlying latent

actors which are close in this latent space are more likely to be tied by an
edge. This is an appealing approach since it allows the model to cluster actors
which consequently provides the practitioner with useful qualitative
information. However, exploring the uncertainty in the number of underlying
latent components in the mixture distribution is a complex task. The current
state-of-the-art is to use an approximate form of BIC for this purpose, where
an approximation of the log-likelihood is used instead of the true
log-likelihood which is unavailable. The main contribution of this paper is to
show that through the use of conjugate prior distributions it is possible to
analytically integrate out almost all of the model parameters, leaving a
posterior distribution which depends on the allocation vector of the mixture
model. This enables posterior inference over the number of components in the

and steepness of the phase curve over the surface. Maps of these two
photometric parameters show large scale albedo variations, which appear to be
associated with compositional differences. They also reveal the location of
photometrically extreme terrains, where the phase curve is unusually shallow or
steep. We find that shallow phase curves are associated with steep slopes on
crater walls and faults, as calculated from a shape model. On the other hand,
the phase curve of ejecta associated with young impact craters is steep. We
interpret these variations in phase curve slope in terms of physical roughness
of the regolith. The lack of rough ejecta around older craters suggests that
initially rough ejecta associated with impact craters on Vesta are smoothed
over a relatively short time of several tens of Myr. We propose that this
process is the result of impact gardening, and as such represents a previously

description of both the parameters of the media and the values of the wave

By using the Triggered Cells Method (TCM) one may effectively increase the
available memory of a given system by approximately two orders of magnitude in
chosen scenarios, and reduce the calculation time by the same factor. The
method is most applicable for pulse or bursts propagation, and can achieve
outstanding results using single CPU, although it is easily parallelizable for
multiple CPU's. This paper will introduce the method using the simple case of
the Finite Difference Time Domain implementation of the scalar wave equation,

linear multivariate statistics or composite analysis. Especially the former
assumes the same type of linear statistical dependency to apply across
different phases of the El Ni\~no--Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which appears
not necessarily a justified assumption. Here, we statistically evaluate the
likelihood of co-occurrences between very high or very low seasonal

of the respective EP and CP types of both, El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. By
employing event coincidence analysis, we uncover differential imprints of both

regions across the globe, which may severely affect, among others, agricultural
and biomass production or public health. We particularly find that EP periods
exhibit statistically significant event coincidence rates with
hydrometeorological anomalies at larger spatial scales, whereas sparser
patterns emerge along with CP periods. Our statistical analysis confirms
previously reported interrelations for EP periods and uncovers additional
distinct regional patterns of very high/low seasonal precipitation, such as
increased rainfall over Central Asia alongside CP periods that have to our
knowledge not been reported so far. Our results demonstrate that a thorough
distinction of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na into their two respective flavors could
be crucial for understanding the emergence of strong regional

extended our study of H-band DIBs in Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Telluric Standard Star (TSS) spectra. We used the
strong 15273A band to select the most and least absorbed targets. We used
individual spectra of the former subsample to extract weaker DIBs, and we
searched the two stacked series for differences that could indicate additional
bands. High-resolution NARVAL and SOPHIE optical spectra for a subsample of 55
TSS targets were additionally recorded for NIR/optical correlative studies.
From the TSS spectra we extract a catalog of measurements of the poorly studied
15617, 15653, and 15673A DIBs in about 300 sightlines, we obtain a first
accurate determination of their rest wavelength and constrained their intrinsic
width and shape. In addition, we studied the relationship between these weak
bands and the strong 15273A DIB. We provide a first or second confirmation of
several other weak DIBs that have been proposed based on different instruments,
and we add new constraints on their widths and locations. We finally propose
two new DIB candidates. We compared the strength of the 15273A absorptions with
their optical counterparts 5780, 5797, 6196, 6283, and 6614A. Using the
5797-5780 ratio as a tracer of shielding against the radiation field, we showed
that the 15273A DIB carrier is significantly more abundant in unshielded

that, when $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{B}$ and $R$ are moreover braided, a

  In this note, sufficient conditions on the category $\mathcal{A}$ for

involve the existence of suitable colimits that we interpret as objects which
are simultaneously initial in four distinguished categories (among which the

introducing a relative version of the notion of weakly coreflective
subcategory, which turns out to be a useful tool to compare the initial objects

  We apply our results to obtain an analogue of Sweedler's finite dual for the
category of vector spaces graded by an abelian group $G$ endowed with a

  steep terrain using arbitrary meshes",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2017.04.061",,"math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Including terrain in atmospheric models gives rise to mesh distortions near
the lower boundary that can degrade accuracy and challenge the stability of
transport schemes. Multidimensional transport schemes avoid splitting errors on
distorted, arbitrary meshes, and method-of-lines schemes have low computational
cost because they perform reconstructions at fixed points.
  This paper presents a multidimensional method-of-lines finite volume
transport scheme, ""cubicFit"", which is designed to be numerically stable on
arbitrary meshes. Stability conditions derived from a von Neumann stability
analysis are imposed during model initialisation to obtain stability and
improve accuracy in distorted regions of the mesh, and near steeply-sloping
lower boundaries. Reconstruction calculations depend upon the mesh only,
needing just one vector multiply per face per time-stage irrespective of the
velocity field.
  The cubicFit scheme is evaluated using three, idealised numerical tests. The
first is a variant of a standard horizontal transport test on severely
distorted terrain-following meshes. The second is a new test case that assesses
accuracy near the ground by transporting a tracer at the lower boundary over
steep terrain on terrain-following meshes, cut-cell meshes, and new,
slanted-cell meshes that do not suffer from severe time-step constraints
associated with cut cells. The third, standard test deforms a tracer in a
vortical flow on hexagonal-icosahedral meshes and cubed-sphere meshes. In all
tests, cubicFit is stable and largely insensitive to mesh distortions, and
cubicFit results are more accurate than those obtained using a multidimensional
linear upwind transport scheme. The cubicFit scheme is second-order convergent
regardless of mesh distortions.

electrons that travels around the protons for a few meters. The electron beam
is produced by a cathode and then guided by a strong magnetic field generated
by a set of superconducting solenoids. The first step of the design is the
definition of the magnetic fields that drive the electron trajectories. The
estimation of such trajectories by means of a dedicated MATLAB tool is
presented. The influence of the main geometrical and electrical parameters are
analysed and discussed. Then, the main mechanical design choices for the
solenoids, cryostats gun and collector are described. The aim of this paper is
to provide an overview of the preliminary design of the Electron Lens for LHC.
The methods used in this study also serve as examples for future mechanical and

for prograde, polar and retrograde orbits. We employ the numerical framework of
our earlier exploration of resonance capture at arbitrary inclination. Randomly
constructed samples of massless particles are set to migrate radially from
outside the orbit of a Jupiter-mass planet at different drift rates totalling
more than $1.6\times 10^6$ numerical simulations. Slower drift rates reduce
overall capture probability especially for prograde orbits and enhance capture
at specific initial inclinations of high order resonances such as the outer
1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 2:5, 3:7 and 5:7. Global capture is reduced with increasing
eccentricity at all inclinations as high order resonances capture more
particles that are subsequently lost by disruptive close encounters with the
planet. The relative efficiency of retrograde resonances at long-lived capture
with respect to prograde resonances is explained by the reduced effect of
planet encounters as such events occur with a shorter duration and a higher
relative velocity for retrograde motion. Capture in the coorbital 1:1 resonance
is marginally affected by the radial drift rate except for nearly coplanar
retrograde eccentric orbits whose capture likelihood is increased significantly
with slower drift rates. An unexpected finding is the presence of a dynamical
corridor for capture in high order inner prograde resonances with initial
inclinations in the range [50$^\circ$,80$^\circ$] especially at the inner 5:2
resonance whose capture likelihood peaks at 80% to 90% depending on initial
eccentricity.

These theories (two-color QCD, G2-QCD, or adjoint QCD) typically contain
bosonic baryons, for example diquarks, or other more exotic states of matter.
It is therefore important to understand the effects of such bosonic matter and
disentangle them from fermionic baryons where they exist to draw conclusions
for QCD. Simulations of these theories, for instance G2-QCD, reveal an
interesting and rich phase diagram at zero temperature. Many open questions
arise, partly due to the lack of high precision or large volume/continuum data.
This is the reason why we study two-dimensional QCD-like theories. In this

$B_J$ which as a set is just $J$ copies of the natural numbers. The goal is to
determine $B_J(\infty)$ and in particular to show that it is a polyhedral
subset of $B_J$. In earlier work this led to the notion of an $S$-graph
associated to a given simple root $\alpha$. Here the notion of a giant
$S$-graph depending on a fixed simple root is introduced. It is essentially a
union of $S$-graphs for each simple root with one distinguished vertex
depending on $\alpha$. Its vertices, which forms a giant $S$-set, determine a
set of dual Kashiwara functions. These are linear functions on $B_J$, whose
common maximum determines the dual Kashiwara parameter with respect to
$\alpha$. From these parameters one may compute $B_J(\infty)$ as an explicit
polyhedral subset of $B_J$.
  For $W$ finite, Berenstein and Zelevinsky had studied this problem by
introducing the notion of a trail in a fundamental module. The functions they
define may also be viewed as a set of dual Kashiwara functions. The goal is to
relate these two approaches and without restriction on $W$. It is shown under
the hypothesis that no ""false"" trails exist, that the set of trails determines
the ""$Z$-convex envelope"" of a giant $S$-set. The proof involves the study of

water filtration and gas separation applications. Experimental evidences have
shown that graphene oxide can be impermeable to liquids, vapors and gases,
while allowing a fast permeation of water molecules. This phenomenon has been
attributed to the formation of a network of nano capillaries that allow nearly
frictionless water flow while blocking other molecules by steric hindrance
effects. It is supposed that water molecules are transported through the
percolated two-dimensional channels formed between graphene-based sheets.
Although these channels allow fast water permeation in such materials, the flow
rates are strongly dependent on how the membranes are fabricated. Also, some
fundamental issues regarding the nanoscale mechanisms of water permeation are
still not fully understood and their interpretation remains controversial. In
this work, we have investigated the dynamics of water permeation through
pristine graphene and graphene oxide model membranes. We have carried out fully
atomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations of systems composed of
multiple layered graphene-based sheets into contact with a water reservoir
under controlled thermodynamics conditions (e. g., by varying temperature and
pressure values). We have systematically analyzed how the transport dynamics of
the confined nanofluids depend on the interlayer distances and the role of the
oxide functional groups. Our results show the water flux is much more effective
for graphene than for graphene oxide membranes. These results are attributed to
the H-bonds formation between oxide functional groups and water, which traps
the water molecules and precludes ultrafast water transport through the
nanochannels.

mechanism which is crucial to their dynamical evolution. However, the processes
regulating the gas energetics have not been well constrained by observations so
far. We aim at studying the processes involved in disk photoevaporation when it
is driven by far-UV photons. We present a unique Herschel survey and new ALMA
observations of four externally-illuminated photoevaporating disks (a.k.a.
proplyds). For the analysis of these data, we developed a 1D model of the
photodissociation region (PDR) of a proplyd, based on the Meudon PDR code and
computed the far infrared line emission. We successfully reproduce most of the
observations and derive key physical parameters, i.e. densities at the disk
surface of about $10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ and local gas temperatures of about 1000 K.
Our modelling suggests that all studied disks are found in a transitional
regime resulting from the interplay between several heating and cooling
processes that we identify. These differ from those dominating in classical
PDRs, i.e. grain photo-electric effect and cooling by [OI] and [CII] FIR lines.
This energetic regime is associated to an equilibrium dynamical point of the
photoevaporation flow: the mass-loss rate is self-regulated to set the envelope
column density at a value that maintains the temperature at the disk surface
around 1000 K. From our best-fit models, we estimate mass-loss rates - of the
order of $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$/yr - that are in agreement with earlier
spectroscopic observation of ionised gas tracers. This holds only if we assume
an evaporation flow launched from the disk surface at sound speed
(supercritical regime). We have identified the energetic regime regulating
FUV-photoevaporation in proplyds. This regime could be implemented into models
of the dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks.

fine-turning network produces detailed features for these candidate boxes. We
show intriguingly that by applying different feature fusion techniques, the
initial boxes can be refined for both localization and recognition. We evaluate
our network on the recent DETRAC benchmark and obtain a significant improvement

connectivity. Internet of things (IoT) is the paradigm that offers a solution
for the inter-connectivity of devices, but in dense IoT networks time
synchronization is a critical aspect. Further, the scalability is another
crucial aspect. This paper focuses on synchronization for uncoordinated dense
networks without any external timing reference. Two synchronization methods are
proposed and compared: i) conventional synchronization that copes with the high
density of nodes by frame collision-avoidance methods (e.g., CSMA/CA) to avoid
the superimposition (or collision) of synchronization signals; and ii)
distributed synchronization that exploits the frames' collision to drive the
network to a global synchronization. The distributed synchronization algorithm
allows the network to reach a timing synchronization status based on a common
beacon with the same signature broadcasted by every device. The superimposition
of beacons from all the other devices enables the network synchronization,
rather than preventing it. Numerical analysis evaluates the synchronization
performance based on the convergence time and synchronization dispersion, both
on collision and non-collision scenario, by investigating the scalability of
the network. Results prove that in dense network the ensemble of signatures
provides remarkable improvements of synchronization performance compared to
conventional master-slave reference.

galaxies. We found that the specific star formation rate, sSFR FUV, determined
via the FUV GALEX flux, increases steadily from the early type to late type
disks for both the UFG and RFGC-UFG samples, showing no significant mutual
difference within each morphological type T. The population of UFG disks has
the average H,I-mass-to-stellar-mass ratio by $(0.25\pm0.03)$ dex higher than
that of RFGC--UFG galaxies. Being compared with arbitrary orientated disks of
the same type, the ultra-flat edge-on galaxies reveal that their total H,I mass
is hidden by self-absorption on the average by approximately 0.20 dex. We
demonstrate that using the robust stellar mass estimate via $\langle B-K
\rangle$-color and galaxy type T for the thin disks, together with a nowaday
accounting for internal extinction, yields their sSFR quantities definitely
lying below the limit of $-9.4$ dex,(yr$^{-1}$). The collected observational
data on UFG disks imply that their average star formation rate in the past has
been approximately three times the current SFR. The UFG galaxies have also
sufficient amount of gas to support their observed SFR over the following
nearly 9 Gyrs.

Specifically, the parameters may be tuned so the competing plasma
self-defocusing nonlinearity only dominates over the Kerr self-focusing
nonlinearity around the soliton self-compression stage, where the increasing
peak intensity on the leading pulse edge initiates a competing self-defocusing
plasma nonlinearity acting nonlocally on the trailing edge, effectively
preventing soliton-formation there. As the plasma switches off after the
self-compression stage, self-focusing dominates again, initiating another
soliton self-compression stage in the trailing edge. This process is
accompanied by supercontinuum generation spanning 1-4 {\mu}m. The technique

case of isotropic refinement with the dilation matrix all of whose eigenvalues
are equal in the absolute value. The general anisotropic case has resisted to
be fully understood: the matrix approach can determine whether a refinable

opposite helicity selection rule from the $s$-orbitals in a given valley. The
trigonal warping effects in realistic hexagonal lattices further renders more
excited states bright, where $p$-orbitals can also be accessed by one-photon
excitation with the opposite valley selection rules to the $s$-orbitals. The
one-photon generation of exciton in the various states and the intra-excitonic
transition between these states are both dictated by the discrete in-plane
rotational symmetry of the lattices, and our results show that in hexagonal 2D
materials the symmetry allowed transitions are enabled when trigonal warping
effects are included in the massive Dirac fermion model. In monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides where excitons can be generated by visible

statistical systems, corresponding to boundaries between qualitatively
different mechanisms of maintaining unlikely values of dynamical observables
over long periods of time. They manifest themselves in the form of
non-analyticities in the large deviation function of those observables. In this
paper, we look at bulk-driven exclusion processes with open boundaries. It is
known that the standard asymmetric simple exclusion process exhibits a
dynamical phase transition in the large deviations of the current of particles
flowing through it. That phase transition has been described thanks to specific
calculation methods relying on the model being exactly solvable, but more
general methods have also been used to describe the extreme large deviations of
that current, far from the phase transition. We extend those methods to a large
class of models based on the ASEP, where we add arbitrary spatial
inhomogeneities in the rates and short-range potentials between the particles.
We show that, as for the regular ASEP, the large deviation function of the
current scales differently with the size of the system if one considers very
high or very low currents, pointing to the existence of a dynamical phase
transition between those two regimes: high current large deviations are
extensive in the system size, and the typical states associated to them are
Coulomb gases, which are correlated ; low current large deviations do not
depend on the system size, and the typical states associated to them are
anti-shocks, consistently with a hydrodynamic behaviour. Finally, we illustrate
our results numerically on a simple example, and we interpret the transition in
terms of the current pushing beyond its maximal hydrodynamic value, as well as
relate it to the appearance of Tracy-Widom distributions in the relaxation
statistics of such models.

attacker, where controller's goal is to maneuver the plant (a simple model of
flocking dynamics) into a V-formation, and the goal of the attacker is to
prevent the controller from doing so. Controllers in V-formation games utilize
a new formulation of model-predictive control we call Adaptive-Horizon MPC
(AMPC), giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain
controllability assumptions, an AMPC controller is able to attain V-formation
with probability 1.
  We define several classes of attackers, including those that in one move can
remove R birds from the flock, or introduce random displacement into flock
dynamics. We consider both naive attackers, whose strategies are purely
probabilistic, and AMPC-enabled attackers, putting them on par strategically
with the controllers. While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every
game with probability 1, in practice, it is resource-constrained: its maximum
prediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed.
Under these conditions, an attacker has a much better chance of winning a
V-formation game.
  Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical
model checking to estimate the probability an attacker can thwart the
controller. Our results show that for the bird-removal game with R = 1, the
controller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For R = 2,
the game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed. For the
displacement game, our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker,
i.e. one that uses AMPC in this case, significantly outperforms its naive
counterpart that randomly executes its attack.

processing pipeline, significantly impacting the performance of the entire
recognition system. Existing approaches to ear detection, for example, are
commonly susceptible to the presence of severe occlusions, ear accessories or
variable illumination conditions and often deteriorate in their performance if
applied on ear images captured in unconstrained settings. To address these
shortcomings, we present in this paper a novel ear detection technique based on
convolutional encoder-decoder networks (CEDs). For our technique, we formulate
the problem of ear detection as a two-class segmentation problem and train a
convolutional encoder-decoder network based on the SegNet architecture to
distinguish between image-pixels belonging to either the ear or the non-ear
class. The output of the network is then post-processed to further refine the
segmentation result and return the final locations of the ears in the input
image. Different from competing techniques from the literature, our approach
does not simply return a bounding box around the detected ear, but provides
detailed, pixel-wise information about the location of the ears in the image.
Our experiments on a dataset gathered from the web (a.k.a. in the wild) show
that the proposed technique ensures good detection results in the presence of
various covariate factors and significantly outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art.

also observed strong evidence (lowest p = 2.01e-184) for differential

allows a robust description of the small scale properties of the system
exploiting the convergence of the statistics with respect to the regularisation
parameter. It is shown that sub-Kolmogorov particles/droplets modify the energy
spectrum leading to a scaling law, $E(k)\propto k^{-4}$, that emerges at small
scales where the particle forcing balances the viscous dissipation. This regime
is confirmed by Direct Numerical Simulation data of a particle-laden
statistically steady homogeneous shear flow, demonstrating the ability of the
regularised model to capture the relevant small-scale physics. The energy
budget in spectral space, extended to account for the inter-phase momentum
exchange, highlights how the particle provide an energy sink in the production
range that turns into a source at small scales. Overall, the dissipative
fluid-particle interaction is found to stall the energy cascade processes

homogenization method, coupling meso-scale discrete particle models to macro-
scale finite element models, is formulated into an adaptive framework. A
continuum multiaxial failure criterion for concrete is calibrated on the basis
of fine-scale simulations, and it serves as the adaptive criterion in the
multiscale framework. Thus, in this approach, simulations start without
assigning any material Representative Volume Element (RVE) to the macro-scale
finite elements. The finite elements that meet the adaptive criterion and must
be entered into the multiscale homogenization framework are detected on the
fly. This leads to a substantial reduction of the computational cost especially
for loading conditions leading to damage localization in which only a small
portion of the FE mesh is enriched with the homogenized RVE. Several numerical
simulations are carried out to investigate the capability of the developed
adaptive homogenization method. In addition, a detailed study on the
computational cost is performed.

is studied. The consideration is carried out within the framework of an
approximate approach where the cosmological scale factor is expanded as a power
series for relatively small values of the redshift corresponding to the epoch
of the present accelerated expansion of the Universe. For several different
dark energy models, we obtain dispersion relations for gravitational waves

shows how the first digit probabilities of a group of continuous real-valued

are related to specific real-life situations, as well as the summary for all
basic algebraic functions, were brought to the reader's attention. Besides, the
Benford's formula was derived with no use of any additional guiding sources.
  Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of a group of certain discrete functions
was performed by approximating the functions to the above-mentioned continuous
ones, taking limits, and other methods.
  The work can be applied for calculating the first digit probabilities of more
advanced functions as well while using the same approach. Furthermore, the
technique can be useful while dealing with a large set of highly approximate

earlier attempt by Ohmura) and recently developed by Van Vlaenderen and Waser,
Hively and Giakos, can be re-written and solved in a simple and effective way
in the standard covariant 4D formalism. This displays more clearly some of its
features. The theory allows a very interesting consistent generalization of the
Maxwell equations. In particular, the generalized field equations are
compatible with sources (classical, or more likely of quantum nature) for which
the continuity/conservation equation $\partial_\mu j^\mu=0$ is not valid
everywhere, or is valid only as an average above a certain scale. And yet,
remarkably, in the end the observable $F^{\mu \nu}$ field is still generated by
a conserved effective source which we denote as $(j^\nu+i^\nu)$, being $i^\nu$
a suitable non-local function of $j^\nu$. This implies that any microscopic
violation of the charge continuity condition is ""censored"" at the macroscopic
level, although it has real consequences, because it generates a non-Maxwellian
component of the field. We consider possible applications of this formalism to
condensed-matter systems with macroscopic quantum tunneling. The extended
electrodynamics can also be coupled to fractional quantum systems.

paints floating on a liquid surface. If the marbling motions are executed
slowly, then this layer of paints can be modeled as a two-dimensional
incompressible Newtonian fluid.
  In this highly constrained model many marbling techniques can be exactly
represented by closed form homeomorphisms. Homeomorphisms can be composed and
compute the composite mapping at any resolution. Computing homeomorphisms
directly is orders of magnitude faster than finite-element methods in solving
paint marbling flows.
  Most marbling patterns involve drawing rakes from one side of the tank to the
other; and these can be modeled by exact closed form homeomorphisms. But
pictorial designs for flowers and animals use short strokes of a single stylus;

For any rational worldline the collective R-C dynamics is manifestly
Lorentz-invariant and conservative; the latter property follows directly from
the structure of Vieta formulas for the LCE roots. In particular, two Lorentz
invariants, the square of total 4-momentum and total rest mass, are distinct

gravity, cosmological parameter can be non-zero. We obtain the conserved

algebra is a semidirect product of a $BMS_{3}$ algebra and two $U(1)$ current
algebras. Also we verify that the $BMS_{3}$ algebra can be obtained by a
contraction of the AdS$_3$ asymptotic symmetry algebra when the AdS$_3$ radius
