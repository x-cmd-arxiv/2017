lower-left corner of the Columbia plot, are puzzling. The transition is
expected to be first-order for massless quarks, and to remain so for a range of
quark masses until it turns second-order at a critical quark mass. But this
critical quark mass and resulting ""pion"" mass disagree violently between Wilson
and staggered fermions at finite lattice spacing, and decrease sharply with the
lattice spacing, for staggered fermions at least. To clarify this puzzle and
eliminate potential systematic effects from rooting, we study the 4-flavor
theory with staggered fermions, on lattices with 4 to 10 time-slices. Our
results are qualitatively similar to the 3-flavor case, so that rooting is not
an issue. However, dramatic cutoff effects are visible, even on our finest
lattices. Universality implies that cutoff effects for Wilson fermions are even
more dramatic. In order to obtain a first-order thermal transition in the
continuum theory, extremely light quarks are needed.

additional evidence for the anisotropy. The results are important with respect

of their low gravity present a major challenge in landing, surface excavation

Previous asteroid excavation efforts have focused on discrete capture events
(an extension of sampling technology) or whole-asteroid capture and processing.
This paper analyzes the control of a bucket-wheel design for asteroid or
small-body excavation. Our study focuses on system design of two counter
rotating bucket-wheels that are attached to a hovering spacecraft. Regolith is
excavated and heated to 1000 C to extract water. The water in turn is
electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. We analyze control
techniques to maximize traction of the bucket-wheels on the asteroid surface
and minimize lift-off the surface, together with methods to dig deeper into the
asteroid surface. Our studies combine analytical models, with simulation and
hardware testing. For initial evaluation of material-spacecraft dynamics and

cohesion. Our early studies point towards a promising pathway towards
refinement of this technology for demonstration aboard a future space mission.

three-level block-circulant structure that allows the FFT-based
diagonalization, while for the finite extended systems in a box (Dirichlet
boundary conditions) we arrive at the perturbed block-Toeplitz representation
providing fast matrix-vector multiplication and low storage size. The proposed
grid-based tensor techniques manifest the twofold benefits: (a) the entries of
the Fock matrix are computed by 1D operations using low-rank tensors
represented on a 3D grid, (b) in the periodic case the low-rank tensor
structure in the diagonal blocks of the Fock matrix in the Fourier space
reduces the conventional 3D FFT to the product of 1D FFTs. Lattice type systems
in a box with Dirichlet boundary conditions are treated numerically by our
previous tensor solver for single molecules, which makes possible calculations
on rather large $L_1\times L_2\times L_3$ lattices due to reduced numerical
cost for 3D problems. The numerical simulations for both box-type and periodic

called Bloom Filter-based Routing (BFR), which is fully distributed, content
oriented, and topology agnostic at the intra-domain level. In BFR, origin
servers advertise their content objects using Bloom filters. We compare the
performance of the proposed BFR with flooding and shortest path content
discovery approaches. BFR outperforms its counterparts in terms of the average
round-trip delay, while it is shown to be very robust to false positive reports
from Bloom filters. Also, BFR is much more robust than shortest path routing to
topology changes. BFR strongly outperforms flooding and performs almost equal
with shortest path routing with respect to the normalized communication costs
for data retrieval and total communication overhead for forwarding Interests.
All the three approaches achieve similar mean hit distance. The signalling
overhead for content advertisement in BFR is much lower than the signalling
overhead for calculating shortest paths in the shortest path approach. Finally,
BFR requires small storage overhead for maintaining content advertisements.

sixth-order compact finite difference scheme is used to discretize the
linearized Navier-Stokes equations leading to a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem
(GEVP). Sparsity is retained by explicitly introducing derivatives of the
perturbation as additional unknowns, increasing the overall problem size
(number of columns $\times$ number of rows) while significantly reducing the
number of non-zeros and the computational cost with respect to traditional
implementations yielding otherwise dense matrix blocks. The resulting GEVP is
coded in Python and solved employing an Message Passing Interface (MPI)
parallelized PETSc-based sparse eigenvalue solver adopting a modified Arnoldi
algorithm. Base flow is taken from impermeable isothermal-wall turbulent
channel flow simulations at bulk Reynolds number, $Re_b= 6900$ and Mach number,
$M_b = 0.85$. The eigenvalue spectrum calculated in the biglobal stability
analysis shows distinct groups of modes associated with a discrete set of
streamwise wave numbers accommodated by computational domain. An iterative
strategy for the imposition of the complex IBCs, which are a nonlinear function
of the real-valued (Fourier) frequency in the GEVP, has been devised. The
adopted IBC specifically represents an array of sub-surface-mounted Helmholtz
cavities with resonant frequency, $f_{res}$, covered by a porous sheet with
permeability inversely proportional to the impedance resistance $R$. The
tunable resonant frequency has been shown to be an attractor for the
instability, yielding a single unstable mode at that frequency.

Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with quark-flavour violation (QFV) in the
squark sector. The renormalization is done in the $\overline{\rm DR}$ scheme.
The gluon and photon radiations are included by adding the corresponding
three-body decay widths. We discuss the dependence of the gluino decay widths
on the QFV parameters. The main dependence stems from the $\tilde c_R - \tilde
t_R$ mixing in the decays to up-type squarks, and from the $\tilde s_R - \tilde
b_R$ mixing in the decays to down-type squarks due to the strong constraints
from B-physics on the other quark-flavour mixing parameters. The full one-loop
corrections to the gluino decay widths are mostly negative and of the order of
about -10\%. The QFV part stays small in the total width but can vary up to
-8\% for the decay width into the lightest squark. For the corresponding
branching ratio the effect is somehow washed out by at least a factor of two.
The electroweak corrections can be as large as 35\% of the SUSY QCD
corrections.

with neutral atoms where in contrast to ions the interparticle interaction is
widely tunable by Feshbach resonances. Moreover, the inter-species entanglement

Our work, together with the technologies of single--qubit gate and C--NOT gate

The number of sequences compatible with a given structure (e.g. the number of
RNA sequences folding into a particular secondary structure, or the number of
DNA sequences coding for the same protein structure) is astronomically large in
all functional molecules investigated. However, an exhaustive experimental or
computational study of all RNA folds or all protein structures becomes
impossible even for moderately long sequences. Here, we analytically derive the
distribution of phenotype sizes for a hierarchy of models which successively
incorporate features of increasingly realistic sequence-to-structure
genotype-phenotype maps. The main feature of these models relies on the
characterization of each phenotype through a prototypical sequence whose sites
admit a variable fraction of letters of the alphabet. Our models interpolate
between two limit distributions: a powerlaw distribution, when the ordering of
sites in the prototypical sequence is strongly constrained, and a lognormal
distribution, as suggested for RNA, when different orderings of the same set of

and expressive power of nanoscale self-assembling molecular systems. In the
well-studied cooperative, or temperature 2, abstract tile assembly model it is
known that there is a tile set to simulate any Turing machine and an
intrinsically universal tile set that simulates the shapes and dynamics of any
instance of the model, up to spatial rescaling. It has been an open question as
to whether the seemingly simpler noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is
capable of such behaviour. Here we show that this is not the case, by showing
that there is no tile set in the noncooperative model that is intrinsically
universal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing machine simulation within a
bounded region of the plane.
  Although the noncooperative model intuitively seems to lack the complexity
and power of the cooperative model it was not obvious how to prove this. One
reason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of
complicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A
second reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the
model (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles
that repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great
computational, and sometimes simulation, power. Our main results show that all
of these generalisations provably increase computational and/or simulation
power. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic
noncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with the
fact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D
noncooperative tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal
tilesets. Our second main result gives a new technique (reduction to
simulation) for proving negative results about computation in tile assembly.

number of components. In physical networks, these interactions often occur
along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection
topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviors such as
synchronization. While descriptions of these behaviors are important, they are
only a first step towards understanding the relationship between network
topology and system behavior, and harnessing that relationship to optimally
control the system's function. Here, we use linear network control theory to
analytically relate the topology of a subset of structural connections (those
linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to
control networked systems. As opposed to the numerical computations of control
energy, our accurate closed-form expressions yield general structural features
in networks that require significantly more or less energy to control,
providing topological principles for the design and modification of network
behavior. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach
to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from drosophila, mouse,
and human brains. We use these principles to show that connectomes of
increasingly complex species are wired to reduce control energy. We then use
the analytical expressions we derive to perform targeted manipulation of the
brain's control profile by removing single edges in the network, a manipulation
that is accessible to current clinical techniques in patients with neurological
disorders. Cross-species comparisons suggest an advantage of the human brain in
supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs, while remaining
unexpectedly robust to perturbations. Our results ground the expectation of a
system's dynamical behavior in its network architecture.

many domains generating massive amounts of raw data, e.g., astronomy, since it
provides immediate SQL querying over raw files. The performance of in-situ
processing across a query workload is, however, limited by the speed of full
scan, tokenizing, and parsing of the entire data. Online aggregation (OLA) has
been introduced as an efficient method for data exploration that identifies
uninteresting patterns faster by continuously estimating the result of a
computation during the actual processing---the computation can be stopped as
early as the estimate is accurate enough to be deemed uninteresting. However,
existing OLA solutions have a high upfront cost of randomly shuffling and/or
sampling the data. In this paper, we present OLA-RAW, a bi-level sampling
scheme for parallel online aggregation over raw data. Sampling in OLA-RAW is
query-driven and performed exclusively in-situ during the runtime query
execution, without data reorganization. This is realized by a novel
resource-aware bi-level sampling algorithm that processes data in random chunks
concurrently and determines adaptively the number of sampled tuples inside a
chunk. In order to avoid the cost of repetitive conversion from raw data,
OLA-RAW builds and maintains a memory-resident bi-level sample synopsis
incrementally. We implement OLA-RAW inside a modern in-situ data processing
system and evaluate its performance across several real and synthetic datasets
and file formats. Our results show that OLA-RAW chooses the sampling plan that
minimizes the execution time and guarantees the required accuracy for each
query in a given workload. The end result is a focused data exploration process
that avoids unnecessary work and discards uninteresting data.

excitations depend on local variations in the crystal- and chemical structure
on the atomic scale. Here we use monochromated low-loss
scanning-transmission-electron-microscopy electron-energy-loss (LL-STEM-EEL)
spectroscopy, providing the best simultaneous energy and spatial resolution
achieved to-date to unravel the full set of electronic excitations in few-layer
MoS2 nanosheets over a wide energy range. Using first-principles many-body

the experimental EEL spectrum and the plasmonic nature of higher energy-loss
peaks. We also rationalise the non-trivial dependence of the EEL spectrum on
beam and sample geometry such as the number of atomic layers and distance to
steps and edges. Moreover, we show that the excitonic features are dominated by
the long wavelength (q=0) components of the probing field, while the plasmonic
features are sensitive to a much broader range of q-vectors, indicating a
qualitative difference in the spatial character of the two types of collective

The evolution of the phase space density can be modeled by means of the Vlasov

of the problems that often arise in such simulations is the violation of
important physical conservation laws. Numerical diffusion in phase space
translates into unphysical heating, which can increase the overall energy
significantly, depending on the time scale and the plasma regime. In this
paper, a general and straightforward way of improving conservation properties
of Vlasov schemes is presented that can potentially be applied to a variety of
different codes. The basic idea is to use fluid models with good conservation
properties for correcting kinetic models. The higher moments that are missing
in the fluid models are provided by the kinetic codes, so that both kinetic and

investigate the quantum dynamics of excitation energy transfer (EET) in the

spatial correlation of the electric field in the vicinity of the metal, the
spectral density of the evanescent field is similar to that of a shared phonon
bath. However, the EET dynamics under the influence of the evanescent field is
an open and a new problem. Here we use a thin metallic film to investigate the
effect of the evanescent field on the excitation energy transfer in a dimer

metallic film enhances the energy transfer rate at the expense of absorbing
energy during the process. Since the spectral density of the evanescent field
is affected by the geometry of the medium and the distance of a dimer system
from the medium, our results demonstrate the possibility to tune EET based on
material geometry and distances. Our model also serves as an expansion to

input, and is a fundamental notion in domains ranging from differential privacy
to cyber-physical systems. A natural way to formalize program sensitivity is in
terms of metrics on the input and output spaces, requiring that an
$r$-sensitive function map inputs that are at distance $d$ to outputs that are
at distance at most $r \cdot d$. Program sensitivity is thus an analogue of
Lipschitz continuity for programs.
  Reed and Pierce introduced Fuzz, a functional language with a linear type
system that can express program sensitivity. They show soundness operationally,
in the form of a metric preservation property. Inspired by their work, we study
program sensitivity and metric preservation from a denotational point of view.
In particular, we introduce metric CPOs, a novel semantic structure for
reasoning about computation on metric spaces, by endowing CPOs with a
compatible notion of distance. This structure is useful for reasoning about
metric properties of programs, and specifically about program sensitivity. We
demonstrate metric CPOs by giving a model for the deterministic fragment of
Fuzz.

ring on four indeterminates apart from the minor difference that they are not

  Recently, Cho, Hong, and Lau, conjectured that a certain 2-parameter family

features of old passive-evolving galaxies without dust, with stellar masses of
~10^{11} M_sun, have colors that could be related to passive-evolving galaxies
with mean ages larger than 1 Gyr. This suggests they have been formed, on
average, when the Universe was very young (<1 Gyr).
  AIMS. We provide new estimates for the stellar content of these 20 galaxies,
with a deeper analysis for two of them that includes spectroscopy.
  METHODS. We obtained, with the GRANTECAN-10.4 m, ultraviolet rest-frame
spectra of two galaxies and analyzed them together with photometric data. The
remaining 18 galaxies are analyzed only with photometry. We fit the data with
models of a single-burst stellar population (SSP), combinations of two SSPs, as
well as with extended star formation.
  RESULTS. Fits based on one SSP do not provide consistent results for the blue
and red wavelengths. Moreover, the absence in the spectra of a break at ~2,000
angstroms indicates that a rather young component is necessary. Using two SSPs
we can match the photometric and spectroscopic data, with the bulk of the
stellar population being very old (several Gyr) and the remaining contribution
(<5% of stellar mass fraction) from a young, likely residual star formation
component with age <~0.1 Gyr. Exponentially decaying extended star formation
models improve slightly the fits with respect to the single burst model, but
they are considerably worse than the two SSP based fits, further supporting the
residual star formation scenario.
  CONCLUSIONS. The fact that one SSP cannot match these early-type galaxies
highlights the limitations for the use of age estimators based on single lines
or breaks, such as the Balmer break used in cosmic chronometers, thus
questioning this approach for cosmological purposes.

function of pairwise quantification of nodes and edges of two graphs to be
matched. Pairwise measurements usually consider local attributes but disregard
contextual information involved in graph structures. We address this issue by
proposing contextual similarities between pairs of nodes. This is done by
considering the tensor product graph (TPG) of two graphs to be matched, where
each node is an ordered pair of nodes of the operand graphs. Contextual
similarities between a pair of nodes are computed by accumulating weighted
walks (normalized pairwise similarities) terminating at the corresponding
paired node in TPG. Once the contextual similarities are obtained, we formulate
subgraph matching as a node and edge selection problem in TPG. We use
contextual similarities to construct an objective function and optimize it with
a linear programming approach. Since random walk formulation through TPG takes
into account higher order information, it is not a surprise that we obtain more
reliable similarities and better discrimination among the nodes and edges.
Experimental results shown on synthetic as well as real benchmarks illustrate
that higher order contextual similarities add discriminating power and allow
one to find approximate solutions to the subgraph matching problem.

in light of the ongoing discussion between tensor networks and holography. We
describe how to ""lift"" the MERA representation of the ground state of a generic
one dimensional (1D) local Hamiltonian, which has a global onsite symmetry, to
a dual quantum state of a 2D ""bulk"" lattice on which the symmetry appears
gauged. The 2D bulk state decomposes in terms of spin network states, which
label a basis in the gauge-invariant sector of the bulk lattice. This
decomposition is instrumental to obtain expectation values of gauge-invariant

entangled between the gauge and the remaining (""gravitational"") bulk degrees of
freedom that are not fixed by the symmetry. We present numerical results for
ground states of several 1D critical spin chains to illustrate that the bulk
entanglement potentially depends on the central charge of the underlying
conformal field theory. We also discuss the possibility of emergent topological
order in the bulk using a simple example, and also of emergent symmetries in

a fleet of spacecraft measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic

between the solar corona and spacecraft making in-situ measurements. This has
allowed scientists to directly connect processes imaged near the Sun with the
subsequent effects measured in the solar wind. This new capability prompted the
development of a series of tools and techniques to track heliospheric

environment to study the evolution of coronal and solar wind structures, such
as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) and

2D distribution of the standard deviation of the angular shifts in positions of
distant sources (including reference sources of the International Celestial
Reference Frame) with respect to their true positions. For different Galactic
matter distributions the standard deviation of the offset angle can reach
several tens of $\mu as$ (microarcsecond) toward the Galactic center,
decreasing down to 4-6 $\mu as$ at high galactic latitudes. The conditional
standard deviation (`jitter') of 2.5 $\mu as$ is reached within 10 years at
high galactic latitudes and within a few months toward the inner part of the
Galaxy. The photometric microlensing events are not expected to be disturbed by
astrometric random variations anywhere except the inner part of the Galaxy as
the Einstein--Chvolson times are typically much shorter than the jittering
timescale. While a jitter of a single reference source can be up to dozens of
$\mu as$ over some reasonable observational time, using a sample of reference
sources would reduce the error in relative astrometry. The obtained results can
be used for estimating the physical upper limits on the time-dependent accuracy
of astrometric measurements.

find that groups with more concentrated galaxy members show steeper mass

SEDs compatible with the discovery quasar spectra, while the faintest

deflector predict a fourth image at the location of G2/C but considerably
brighter and bluer. The addition of a small satellite galaxy ($R_{\rm

of the fourth image and can explain both the reddening and grey dimming. All

clump A that is host to a potential direct collapse black hole (DCBH), and two
metal enriched star forming clumps B and C. In contrast to claims that
signatures of metals rule out the existence of DCBHs, we show that metal
pollution of A from star forming clumps clumps B and C is inevitable, and that
A can form a DCBH well before its metallicity exceeds the critical threshold of
$10^{-5}-10^{-6}\ \rm Z_{\odot}$. Assuming metal mixing happens
instantaneously, we derive the metallicity of A based on the star formation
history of B and C. We find that treating a final accreting black hole of
$10^6-10^7\ \rm M_{\odot}$ in A for nebular emission already pushes its
$H_{160}$ - [3.6] and [3.6]-[4.5] colours into the 3$\sigma$ limit of
observations. Hence, we show that the presence of metals in DCBH hosts is
inevitable, and that it is the coevolution of the LW radiation field and metals
originating from neighbouring galaxies that governs DCBH formation in a
neighbouring {initially} pristine atomic cooling haloes.

estimates of this signal by using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations to
calculate the X-ray absorption due to the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host

IGM and contribute to the EoH. We find that the X-ray opacity through these

of log[N / cm^-2] = 21.4 +0.40-0.65. We compute the resulting 21-cm signal by
combining these ISM opacities with public spectra of high-mass X-ray binaries

support ""standard scenarios"" in which the X-ray heating of the IGM is
inhomogeneous, and occurs before the bulk of reionization. The large-scale (k ~

optimal control design for jump diffusion processes defined by polynomials. For
such systems, the evolution of the moments of the state can be described via a
system of linear ordinary differential equations. Typically, however, the
moments are not closed and an infinite system of equations is required to
compute statistical moments exactly. Existing methods for stochastic analysis,
known as closure methods, focus on approximating this infinite system of

approach in which the higher order terms, which are approximated in closure
methods, are viewed as inputs to a finite-dimensional linear control system.
Under this interpretation, upper and lower bounds of statistical moments can be
computed via convex linear optimal control problems with semidefinite
constraints. For analysis of steady-state distributions, this optimal control
problem reduces to a static semidefinite program. These same optimization
problems extend automatically to stochastic optimal control problems. For
minimization problems, the methodology leads to guaranteed lower bounds on the

simulated linear polarization observations of two physically motivated models

regularization can achieve an optimal resolution of $\sim 25-30$\% of the
diffraction limit $\lambda/D_{\rm max}$, which is the nominal spatial
resolution of a radio interferometer for both the total intensity (i.e. Stokes
$I$) and linear polarizations (i.e. Stokes $Q$ and $U$). This optimal
resolution is better than that obtained from the widely used Cotton-Schwab
CLEAN algorithm or from using $\ell _1$ or TV regularizations alone.
Furthermore, we find that $\ell _1$+TV regularization can achieve much better
image fidelity in linear polarization than other techniques over a wide range

method, the Randomized Possibility Graph, which uses a high-level decomposition
of the feasibility constraint manifold in order to rapidly find routes that may
lead to a solution. These routes are then examined by lower-level planners to
determine feasibility. In this paper, we show that this approach is
probabilistically complete for bipedal robots performing quasi-static walking

directly identified and highly variable cool hypergiant star. The 2014 outburst
achieved peak luminosity equivalent to that of the historic eruption of
luminous blue variable (LBV) Eta Car, and exhibited a multipeaked optical light
curve that rapidly faded after ~100 days. We report ultraviolet (UV) through
optical observations of SN Hunt248 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) about
1 yr after the outburst, and mid-infrared observations with the Spitzer Space
Telescope before the burst and in decline. The HST data reveal a source that is
a factor of ~10 dimmer in apparent brightness than the faintest available
measurement of the precursor star. The UV-optical spectral energy distribution
(SED) requires a strong Balmer continuum, consistent with a hot B4-B5
photosphere attenuated by grey circumstellar extinction. Substantial
mid-infrared excess of the source is consistent with thermal emission from hot
dust with a mass of 10^{-6} - 10^{-5} MSun and a geometric extent that is
comparable to the expansion radius of the ejecta from the 2014 event. SED
modeling indicates that the dust consists of relatively large grains (>0.3 um),
which could be related to the grey circumstellar extinction that we infer for
the UV-optical counterpart. Revised analysis of the precursor photometry is
also consistent with grey extinction by circumstellar dust, and suggests that
the initial mass of the star could be twice as large as previously estimated
(nearly ~60 MSun). Reanalysis of the earlier outburst data shows that the peak
luminosity and outflow velocity of the eruption are consistent with a trend
exhibited by stellar merger candidates, prompting speculation that SN Hunt248
may also have stemmed from a massive stellar merger or common-envelope
ejection.

Under the ignorability assumption, the consistency of the proposed approach

and fundamental neutrino oscillations parameters are determined with a good
accuracy. In this work, we estimate the impact that a new neutrino physics
model, the so-called generalized Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) oscillation
mechanism, has on the shape of some of leading solar neutrino spectra, some of
which will be partially tested by the next generation of solar neutrino
experiments. In these calculations, we use a high-precision standard solar
model in good agreement with helioseismology data. We found that the neutrino
spectra of the different solar nuclear reactions of the proton-proton chains
and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle have quite distinct sensitivities to the new
neutrino physics. The $HeP$ and $^8B$ neutrino spectra are the ones for which
their shapes are more affected when neutrinos interact with quarks in addition
to electrons. The shape of the $^{15}O$ and $^{17}F$ neutrino spectra are also
modified, although in these cases the impact is much smaller. Finally, the
impact in the shape of the $PP$ and $^{13}N$ neutrino spectra is practically
negligible.

collected 126 spectra of WASP-49, covering three transits of WASP-49b. We
analyzed and modeled the planet transit spectrum, while paying particular
attention to the treatment of potentially spurious signals of stellar origin.
We spectrally resolve the Na I D lines in the planet atmosphere and show that
these signatures are unlikely to arise from stellar contamination. The large
contrasts of $2.0\pm0.5\%$ (D$_2$) and $1.8\pm0.7\%$ (D$_1$) require the

index of WASP-49b, we determine its atmosphere to be cloud free at the
altitudes probed by the sodium lines. WASP-49b is close to the border of the
evaporation desert and exhibits an enhanced thermospheric signature with
respect to a farther-away planet such as HD 189733b.

ANC plays a very important role in nuclear astrophysics, these relations
significantly enhance the power of the derived equations. We present the

which are more densely connected than they are to the rest of the graph. This
problem has a long history, but it is undergoing a resurgence of interest due
to the need to analyze social and biological networks. While there are many
ways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where
there is a ""ground truth"" community structure built into the graph somehow. The
task is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph.
  Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then
rigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase
transition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too
sparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no
algorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one---or
even tell if there are communities, i.e., distinguish the graph from a purely
random one with high probability. Above this information-theoretic threshold,
there is a second threshold beyond which polynomial-time algorithms are known
to succeed; in between, there is a regime in which community detection is
possible, but conjectured to require exponential time.
  For computer scientists, this field offers a wealth of new ideas and open
questions, with connections to probability and combinatorics, message-passing
algorithms, and random matrix theory. Perhaps more importantly, it provides a
window into the cultures of statistical physics and statistical inference, and
how those cultures think about distributions of instances, landscapes of
solutions, and hardness.

approximately 4 mm by 4 mm in size and operating at 25 kHz, and comprises a
thermoacoustic stack and a coin-shaped cavity, a design inspired by Flitcroft
and Symko (2013). Thermal and viscous boundary layers (order of 10
$\mathrm{\mu}$m) are resolved. Vibrational and rotational molecular relaxation
are modeled with an effective bulk viscosity coefficient modifying the viscous
stress tensor. The effective bulk viscosity coefficient is estimated from the
difference between theoretical and semi-empirical attenuation curves.
Contributions to the effective bulk viscosity coefficient can be identified as
from vibrational and rotational molecular relaxation. The inclusion of the
coefficient captures acoustic absorption from infrasonic ($\sim$10 Hz) to
ultrasonic ($\sim$100 kHz) frequencies. The value of bulk viscosity depends on
pressure, temperature, and frequency, as well as the relative humidity of the
working fluid. Simulations of the TAE are carried out to the limit cycle, with
growth rates and limit-cycle amplitudes varying non-monotonically with the
magnitude of bulk viscosity, reaching a maximum for a relative humidity level
of 5%. A corresponding linear model with minor losses was developed; the linear
model overpredicts transient growth rate but gives an accurate estimate of
limit cycle behavior. An improved understanding of thermoacoustic energy
conversion in the ultrasonic regime based on a high-fidelity computational
framework will help to further improve the power density advantages of
small-scale thermoacoustic engines.

  Optimization","23 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.NE math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most common approaches for multiobjective optimization is to
generate a solution set that well approximates the whole Pareto-optimal
frontier to facilitate the later decision-making process. However, how to
evaluate and compare the quality of different solution sets remains
challenging. Existing measures typically require additional problem knowledge
and information, such as a reference point or a substituted set of the
Pareto-optimal frontier. In this paper, we propose a quality measure, called
dominance move (DoM), to compare solution sets generated by multiobjective
optimizers. Given two solution sets, DoM measures the minimum sum of move
distances for one set to weakly Pareto dominate the other set. DoM can be seen
as a natural reflection of the difference between two solutions, capturing all
aspects of solution sets' quality, being compliant with Pareto dominance, and
does not need any additional problem knowledge and parameters. We present an
exact method to calculate the DoM in the biobjective case. We show the
necessary condition of constructing the optimal partition for a solution set's
minimum move, and accordingly propose an efficient algorithm to recursively
calculate the DoM. Finally, DoM is evaluated on several groups of artificial
and real test cases as well as by a comparison with two well-established
quality measures.

with conflicting interpretations of observations and their theoretical models.
We perform a comprehensive analysis of all dwarfs detected in the Milky Way and
find that the DoS structure depends strongly on the plane identification method
and the sample size. In particular, we demonstrate that a smaller sample size
produces a higher anisotropy of the spatial distribution and a stronger
clustering of the angular momentum of the satellites. Moreover, we calculate
the evolution of the 11 classical satellites with proper motion measurements
and find that the thin DoS they currently reside in is transient. Furthermore,
we analyze two cosmological simulations using the same initial conditions of a
Milky Way-sized galaxy, an N-body run with dark matter only and a hydrodynamic
one with both baryonic and dark matter, and find that the hydrodynamic
simulation produces more anisotropic distribution of satellites than the N-body
one. Our results suggest that an anisotropic distribution of satellites in
galaxies can originate from baryonic processes in the hierarchical structure
formation model, but the claimed highly-flattened, coherently-rotating DoS of
the Milky Way may be a small-number selection effect. These findings may help
resolve the contradictory claims of DoS in other galaxies and the discrepancy
among numerical simulations.

heavy hadrons and composite particles. With upgraded detectors at RHIC and LHC,
it has become possible to measure hadrons beyond their ground states.
Therefore, HIC provide a new method for studying exotic hadrons that are either
hadronic molecular states or compact multiquark systems. Because their
structures are related to the fundamental properties of QCD, studying exotic
hadrons is currently one of the most active areas of research in hadron
physics. Experiments carried out at various accelerator facilities have
indicated that some exotic hadrons may have already been produced. The present
review is a summary of the current understanding of a selected set of exotic
particle candidates that can be potentially measured in HIC. It also includes
discussions on the production of exotic hadrons in HIC based on the coalescence
and statistical models. A more detailed discussion leads to the conclusion that
the yield of a hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a
compact multiquark state than that of an excited hadronic state with normal
quark numbers and/or a molecular configuration. Attention is also given to some
of the proposed heavy exotic hadrons that could be produced with sufficient
abundance in HIC because of the significant numbers of charm and bottom quarks
produced at RHIC and LHC, making it possible to study them in these
experiments. Further included in the discussion are the general formalism for
the coalescence model that involves resonance particles and its implication on
the present estimated yield for resonance production. Finally, a review is
given on recent studies to constrain the hadron-hadron interaction through
correlation measurements in HIC and their implications on the interpretation
and the possible existence of exotic states in hadronic interactions.

in estimation of synchronous machine dynamic states (i.e. rotor angle and rotor
speed). This paper proposes an adaptive multi-step prediction (AMSP) approach
to improve the extended Kalman filter s (EKF) performance in estimating the
dynamic states of a synchronous machine. The proposed approach consists of
three major steps. First, two indexes are defined to quantify the non-linearity
levels of the state transition function and measurement function, respectively.
Second, based on the non-linearity indexes, a multi prediction factor (Mp) is
defined to determine the number of prediction steps. And finally, to mitigate
the non-linearity impact on dynamic state estimation (DSE) accuracy, the
prediction step repeats a few time based on Mp before performing the correction
step. The two-area four-machine system is used to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed AMSP approach. It is shown through the Monte-Carlo method that a
good trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational time can be
achieved effectively through the proposed AMSP approach.

a high-resolution, hydrodynamic $\Lambda$CDM simulation of a Milky Way sized

(1) The abundance and distribution of satellite galaxies around a host galaxy
is significantly different in the hydro simulation compared to its N-body
counterpart; (2) No clear coherent rotation is found in the satellite system,
as the fractions of corotating and counter-corotating satellites remain
comparable across cosmic time; (3) The satellite distribution evolves
significantly with time, from nearly isotropic at high redshift to anisotropic
at the present day; (4) The DoS properties strongly depend on sample selection

principal components analysis give results which are unstable and difficult to
interpret.
  To mitigate these problems, we have developed a method which allows the
analyst to incorporate side information about the relationships between the

on the principal axes. This leads to a low-dimensional representation of the
samples which both describes the latent structure and which has axes which are
interpretable in terms of groups of closely related variables.
  The method is derived by putting a prior encoding the relationships between
the variables on the data and following through the analysis on the posterior
distributions of the samples. We show that our method does well at

spins in a highly enriched $^{28}$Si crystal and a 3D dielectric resonator.
Spins were polarized beyond Boltzmann equilibrium using spin selective optical
excitation of the no-phonon bound exciton transition resulting in $N$ =
$3.6\cdot10^{13}$ unpaired spins in the ensemble. We observed a normal mode
splitting of the spin ensemble-cavity polariton resonances of 2$g\sqrt{N}$ =
580 kHz (where each spin is coupled with strength $g$) in a cavity with a
quality factor of 75,000 ($\gamma \ll \kappa \approx$ 60 kHz where $\gamma$ and
$\kappa$ are the spin dephasing and cavity loss rates, respectively). The spin
ensemble has a long dephasing time (T$_2^*$ = 9 $\mu$s) providing a wide window
for viewing the dynamics of the coupled spin ensemble-cavity system. The free
induction decay shows up to a dozen collapses and revivals revealing a coherent
exchange of excitations between the superradiant state of the spin ensemble and
the cavity at the rate $g\sqrt{N}$. The ensemble is found to evolve as a single
large pseudospin according to the Tavis-Cummings model due to minimal
inhomogeneous broadening and uniform spin-cavity coupling. We demonstrate
independent control of the total spin and the initial Z-projection of the
psuedospin using optical excitation and microwave manipulation respectively. We
vary the microwave excitation power to rotate the pseudospin on the Bloch
sphere and observe a long delay in the onset of the superradiant emission as
the pseudospin approaches full inversion. This delay is accompanied by an
abrupt $\pi$ phase shift in the peusdospin microwave emission. The scaling of
this delay with the initial angle and the sudden phase shift are explained by
the Tavis-Cummings model.

generally less than 0.4 eV in the energy range of 4.5 keV to 7.5 keV. Of the

uncertainties that improve on those of existing data by factors of two or more.
These results eliminate a significant discrepancy between measured and

case of 3-irreducible tilings.
  Parallelotopes are convex polytopes which tile the Euclidean space by their
translated copies, like in the honeycomb arrangement of hexagons in the plane.
An important example of parallelotope is the Dirichlet-Voronoi domain for a
translation lattice. For each point $x$ in a translation lattice, we define its
Dirichlet-Voronoi (DV) domain to be the set of points in the space which are at
least as close to $x$ as to any other lattice point. The Voronoi conjecture,
formulated by the great Ukrainian mathematician George Voronoi in 1908, states
that any parallelotope is affinely equivalent to the DV-domain for some
lattice.
  Our work proves the Voronoi conjecture for 3-irreducible parallelotope
tilings of arbitrary dimension: we define the 3-irreducibility as the property
of having only irreducible dual 3-cells. This result generalizes a theorem of
Zhitomirskii (1927), and suggests a way to solve the conjecture in the general

spectral curve of a Higgs bundle. We give a method of quantization of Hitchin
spectral curves by concretely constructing one-parameter deformation families
of opers.
  We propose a variant of the topological recursion of Eynard--Orantin and
Mirzakhani for the context of singular Hitchin spectral curves. We show that a

Topological recursion can be considered as a process of quantization of Hitchin
spectral curves. We prove that these two quantizations, one via the
construction of families of opers, and the other via the PDE recursion of
topological type, agree for holomorphic and meromorphic
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles. Classical differential equations such as the
Airy differential equation provides a typical example. Through these classical
examples, we see that quantum curves relate Higgs bundles, opers, a conjecture

where $A_\phi$ is the $\phi$ component of the vector potential of the

the solution uniqueness. Taking asymptotically uniform field as an example,

uniform field at infinity, while only a unique one is found in general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. To settle down the disagreement,
we reinvestigate the structure of the governing equation and numerically solve
it with given constraint condition and boundary condition. We find that the
constraint condition (field lines smoothly crossing the light surface (LS)) and
boundary conditions at horizon and at infinity are connected via radiation
conditions at horizon and at infinity, rather than being independent. With
appropriate constraint condition and boundary condition, we numerically solve
the governing equation and find a unique solution. Contrary to naive

property: they are homothetic to their evolutes. But what if use convex
symmetric polygons as unit balls, can we define evolutes and cycloids which are
genuinely discrete? Indeed, we can! We define discrete cycloids as eigenvectors
of a discrete double evolute transform which can be seen as a linear operator
on a vector space we call curvature radius space. We are also able to classify
such cycloids according to the eigenvalues of that transform, and show that the
number of cusps of each cycloid is well determined by the ordering of those
eigenvalues. As an elegant application, we easily establish a version of the
four-vertex theorem for closed convex polygons. The whole theory is developed
using only linear algebra, and concrete examples are given.

archaeological artifacts, and returns as output a string of graphemes, suitable
for inclusion in a standard corpus. The image is first decomposed into regions
using Selective Search and these regions are classified as containing textual
and/or graphical information using a convolutional neural network. Regions
classified as potentially containing text are hierarchically merged and trimmed
to remove non-textual information. The remaining textual part of the image is
segmented using standard image processing techniques to isolate individual
graphemes. This set is finally passed to a second convolutional neural network
to classify the graphemes, based on a standard corpus. The classifier can
identify the presence or absence of the most frequent Indus grapheme, the ""jar""

deep learning approaches in computational epigraphy and, more generally, in the

multiple-output (MIMO) system with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs),
in which $K$ users with a single-antenna communicate with one base station (BS)
with $n_r$ antennas. In this system, we propose a novel MIMO detection
framework, which is inspired by coding theory. The key idea of the proposed
framework is to create a non-linear code $\Cc$ of length $n_r$ and rate $K/n_r$
using the encoding function that is completely characterized by a non-linear
MIMO channel matrix. From this, a multiuser MIMO detection problem is converted
into an equivalent channel coding problem, in which a codeword of the $\Cc$ is
sent over $n_r$ parallel binary symmetric channels, each with different
crossover probabilities. Levereging this framework, we develop a maximum
likelihood decoding method, and show that the minimum distance of the $\Cc$ is
strongly related to a diversity order. Furthermore, we propose a practical
implementation method of the proposed framework when the channel state
information is not known to the BS. The proposed method is to estimate the code
$\Cc$ at the BS using a training sequence. Then, the proposed {\em weighted}
minimum distance decoding is applied. Simulations results show that the
proposed method almost achieves an ideal performance with a reasonable training
overhead.

varies as a function of an observed covariate. Generally, larger and more
stable treatment effects are insensitive to larger biases from unmeasured
covariates, so a causal conclusion may be considerably firmer if this pattern
is noted if it occurs. We propose a new strategy, called the submax-method,
that combines exploratory and confirmatory efforts to determine whether there
is stronger evidence of causality - that is, greater insensitivity to
unmeasured confounding - in some subgroups of individuals. It uses the joint
distribution of test statistics that split the data in various ways based on
certain observed covariates. For $L$ binary covariates, the method splits the
population $L$ times into two subpopulations, perhaps first men and women,
perhaps then smokers and nonsmokers, computing a test statistic from each
subpopulation, and appends the test statistic for the whole population, making
$2L+1$ test statistics in total. Although $L$ binary covariates define $2^{L}$
interaction groups, only $2L+1$ tests are performed, and at least $L+1$ of
these tests use at least half of the data. The submax-method achieves the
highest design sensitivity and the highest Bahadur efficiency of its component
tests. Moreover, the form of the test is sufficiently tractable that its large
sample power may be studied analytically. The simulation suggests that the
submax method exhibits superior performance, in comparison with an approach
using CART, when there is effect modification of moderate size. Using data from
the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Survey, an observational study of the
effects of physical activity on survival is used to illustrate the method. The
method is implemented in the $\texttt{R}$ package $\texttt{submax}$ which

example, in the split-variable deterministic reformulation of stochastic
mixed-integer optimization problems. The dual solution approach needs to
address the nonconvexity of the non-relaxed constraint set while being
efficiently implementable in parallel. We adapt the augmented Lagrangian method
framework to address the presence of nonconvexity in the non-relaxed constraint

is most naturally compared with the development of proximal bundle methods and
especially with their use of serious step conditions. However, deviations from
these developments allow for an improvement in efficiency with which
parallelization can be utilized. Pivotal in our modification to the augmented
Lagrangian method is the use of an integration of approaches based on the
simplicial decomposition method (SDM) and the nonlinear block Gauss-Seidel (GS)
method. An adaptation of a serious step condition associated with proximal
bundle methods allows for the approximation tolerance to be automatically
adjusted. Under mild conditions optimal dual convergence is proven, and we
report computational results on test instances from the stochastic optimization

simulate several deployment scenarios of these inverters on a real California

shown to increase at high PV penetrations as a side effect. Furthermore, we

second emission can take place. Here we show that such a picture breaks down in
the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime, when the coupling strength

that are similar as per an input matching rule from databases held by two
parties that do not trust one another. We identify three key desiderata that a
PRL solution must ensure: 1) perfect precision and high recall of matching
pairs, 2) a proof of end-to-end privacy, and 3) communication and computational
costs that scale subquadratically in the number of input records. We show that
all of the existing solutions for PRL - including secure 2-party computation
(S2PC), and their variants that use non-private or differentially private (DP)
blocking to ensure subquadratic cost - violate at least one of the three
desiderata. In particular, S2PC techniques guarantee end-to-end privacy but
have either low recall or quadratic cost. In contrast, no end-to-end privacy
guarantee has been formalized for solutions that achieve subquadratic cost.
This is true even for solutions that compose DP and S2PC: DP does not permit
the release of any exact information about the databases, while S2PC algorithms
for PRL allow the release of matching records.
  In light of this deficiency, we propose a novel privacy model, called output
constrained differential privacy, that shares the strong privacy protection of
DP, but allows for the truthful release of the output of a certain function
applied to the data. We apply this to PRL, and show that protocols satisfying
this privacy model permit the disclosure of the true matching records, but
their execution is insensitive to the presence or absence of a single
non-matching record. We find that prior work that combine DP and S2PC
techniques even fail to satisfy this end-to-end privacy model. Hence, we
develop novel protocols that provably achieve this end-to-end privacy
guarantee, together with the other two desiderata of PRL.

state freeze the particle on this state, known as quantum Zeno effect [1-14].
Measurements on an observable subspace further open the prelude of quantum Zeno
dynamics [15-17]. These phenomena affect the results of quantum measurement
that has been widely used in quantum information and quantum computation
[18-21]. However, this common argument is insufficient when the initial state
is coupled with a continuum reservoir. In such an irreversible system,
intrinsic decay property destroys the frozen behavior. Although it has been
proven that the decay rate of the initial state will be affected by
measurements [7], the knowledge of detailed mechanisms for this
measurement-dependent decay is still limited. In this work, we found based on
three-subsystem perturbation theory that the indirect correlation between a
continuum reservoir and a measurement apparatus through the interaction with a
quantum system causes a Rabi-like inter-modulation among these subsystems. The
indirect correlation effect from this combination drives the system into
quantum Zeno and reactivation regions, which are dependent upon the Rabi
strength, pulse duty, and its repetition rate. We also found that the dynamical
changes of decay rate are quite different in continuous and pulsed
measurements, and, thus, significantly affect the dynamics of the system.

excited state contributions in the nucleus correlation functions by comparing
with calculations using the exponential and wall source operators. However, the
wall source result is obtained in much earlier time than the plateau region. In
order to investigate the systematic error in the plateau region, we calculate
the correlation functions with both the operators in quenched QCD at 0.8 GeV
pion mass and in $N_f=2+1$ QCD at 0.7 GeV pion mass in high accuracy. In this
report we present preliminary results of those calculations, and show that the
energy shift obtained from the two sources agree with each other, if those are
determined from a region, where both the nucleon and two-nucleon correlation
functions have plateaus.

  Rescue?",,,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Methods to classify events experimentally according to collision geometry are
well established and non-controversial when collisions of large ions are
studied. However, high luminosity data from $p/d$+A collisions at RHIC and LHC
provided some surprising results that either call for new physics or question
the applicability of the established methods of event classification for them.
So far there is no consensus in the community what is the proper model and
procedure to determine centrality, how to connect observed event activity with
collision geometry in very asymmetric, $p/d$+A collisions in the same sense and
with the same accuracy as was done in A+A. We argue that high $p_T$ direct
photons offer an {\it a posteriori} test of any method suggested to categorize
$p/d$+A -- and in general, very asymmetric -- collisions: the method is only
viable if the nuclear modification factor for high $p_T$ direct photons is
about unity for all centrality classes.

mildly misaligned circumbinary accretion disk around an eccentric binary can
evolve to an orientation that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the
binary (polar alignment). As the disk evolves to the perpendicular state, it
undergoes nodal libration oscillations of the tilt angle and the longitude of
the ascending node. Dissipation within the disk causes the oscillations to
damp. The process operates above a critical initial misalignment angle that
depends upon the eccentricity of the binary and the mass of the disk. For
binary eccentricity of 0.5, the process operates typically for disk masses
smaller than a few percent of the binary mass and initial tilt angle of more
than 40 degrees. This evolution has important implications for planet formation
around eccentric binary star systems.

  Information Sharing for Threat Intelligence",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Threat intelligence sharing has become a growing concept, whereby entities
can exchange patterns of threats with each other, in the form of indicators, to
a community of trust for threat analysis and incident response. However,
sharing threat-related information have posed various risks to an organization
that pertains to its security, privacy, and competitiveness. Given the
coinciding benefits and risks of threat information sharing, some entities have
adopted an elusive behavior of ""free-riding"" so that they can acquire the
benefits of sharing without contributing much to the community. So far,
understanding the effectiveness of sharing has been viewed from the perspective
of the amount of information exchanged as opposed to its quality. In this
paper, we introduce the notion of quality of indicators (\qoi) for the
assessment of the level of contribution by participants in information sharing
for threat intelligence. We exemplify this notion through various metrics,
including correctness, relevance, utility, and uniqueness of indicators. In
order to realize the notion of \qoi, we conducted an empirical study and taken
a benchmark approach to define quality metrics, then we obtained a reference
dataset and utilized tools from the machine learning literature for quality
assessment. We compared these results against a model that only considers the
volume of information as a metric for contribution, and unveiled various
interesting observations, including the ability to spot low quality
contributions that are synonym to free riding in threat information sharing.

to MIPs and give two specific algorithms to solve them. First, we propose an
algorithm based on DCA originally proposed by Pham Dinh and Le Thi, where
convex MIPs are solved iteratively. Next, to handle nonsmooth functions
efficiently, we incorporate a smoothing technique into the first method. We
show that sequences generated by the two methods converge to stationary points

degree factors, then its discriminant is a quadratic nonresidue in the field.
We give an extension of Stickelberger's Lemma; we construct $r$-th nonresidues

slowly and as equilibrium process, with small difference between two plateaus

prove that the problem is at NP-hard. To further improve the efficiency, we
design a pruning strategy and a preprocessing method, which effectively improve

another approximation solution which is much faster than the general

curbing of the crack formation may be attributed to the capillary
stress-absorbing cushion provided by the elastic arrangements of the liquid
crystal at the substrate-droplet interface. Cracks and allied surface
instabilities are detrimental to the quality of the final product like surface
coatings, and therefore, its suppression by an external inert additive is a
promising technique that will be of immense importance for several industrial

deformed harmonic-oscillator basis. In addition, two other density
distributions of $^{208}$Pb, namely the Fermi-type density determined within
the extended Thomas-Fermi (TF) method and symmetrized-Fermi local density
obtained within the rigorous density functional approach, are used. The kinetic
energy densities are calculated either by the HFBTHO code or, for a comparison,
by the extended TF method up to second order in temperature (with $T^{2}$

flares from active regions originating behind both the eastern and western

coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and strong solar energetic particle events. We
present updated localizations of the >100 MeV photon emission, hard X-ray
(HXR)and EUV images, and broadband spectra from 10 keV to 10 GeV, as well as
microwave spectra. We also provide a comparison of the BTL flares detected by

HXR emission to be due to electron bremsstrahlung from a coronal thin-target
loop top with the accelerated electron spectra steepening at semirelativistic
energies. The >100 MeV gamma-rays are best described by a pion-decay model
resulting from the interaction of protons (and other ions) in a thick-target
photospheric source. The protons are believed to have been accelerated (to
energies >10 GeV) in the CME environment and precipitate down to the
photosphere from the downstream side of the CME shock and landed on the front
side of the Sun, away from the original flare site and the HXR emission.

unclear for larger Chern numbers, the conductance exhibits an oscillatory
behavior of which period is relatively longer than the valley-isospin dependent
oscillation. This conductance oscillation is ascribed to the AB effect, which
is implicitly created by the split metallic channels near the junction

previously speculated to be incompleteness in realistic devices is the
low-visibility conductance oscillation due to unequal beam splitting.

weighting the impact of heterogeneous components of a surgery. While
multi-level approaches, surgical process modeling and other workflow analysis
methods exist, this is to our knowledge the first quantitative approach.
Methods: Inspired by the group decision making problem from the field of
operational research, we define event impact factors, which combine independent
and very diverse low-level functions. This allows us to rate surgical events by
their importance. Results: We conducted surveys with 4 surgeons to determine
the importance of roles, phases and their combinations within a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Applying this data on a recorded surgery, we showed that it is
possible to define a quantitative measure for deciding on acception or
rejection of calls to different roles and at different phases of surgery.
Conclusions: This methodology allows us to use components such as expertise and
role of the surgical staff and other aspects of a given surgery in order to
quantitatively analyze and evaluate events, actions, user interfaces or
procedures.

behavior and kinematics. Often these analyses require that the position of one
or more animal landmarks are annotated (marked) in numerous images. The process
of annotating landmarks can require a significant amount of time and tedious
labor, which motivates the need for algorithms that can automatically annotate
landmarks. In the community of scientists that use image and video analysis to
study the 3D flight of animals, there has been a trend of developing more
automated approaches for annotating landmarks, yet they fall short of being
generally applicable. Inspired by the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on
many problems in the field of computer vision, we investigate how suitable DNNs
are for accurate and automatic annotation of landmarks in video datasets
representative of those collected by scientists studying animals.
  Our work shows, through extensive experimentation on videos of hawkmoths,
that DNNs are suitable for automatic and accurate landmark localization. In
particular, we show that one of our proposed DNNs is more accurate than the
current best algorithm for automatic localization of landmarks on hawkmoth
videos. Moreover, we demonstrate how these annotations can be used to
quantitatively analyze the 3D flight of a hawkmoth. To facilitate the use of
DNNs by scientists from many different fields, we provide a self contained
explanation of what DNNs are, how they work, and how to apply them to other
datasets using the freely available library Caffe and supplemental code that we
provide.

finding their destinations. It is assumed that migrants have both a compass
sense to hold their course, and a map sense --- a kind of ""biological"" GPS ---
to correct accumulated errors and determine right direction during navigation.
Unlike the compass sense, the map sense is still not reliably explained.
Therefore, an alternative way is discussed in literature to eliminate the
errors --- the aggregation of animals in groups and their coordinated movement.
Orientation accuracy of a group may be significantly higher because the errors
caused by the action of a variety of casual factors are averaged. This idea,
called the ""many wrongs principle,"" has been confirmed both in behavioral
experiments and in the results of computer simulations. However, until now
there was no analytical model that considered this effect and its limitations.
Such a model is presented in this article. The model is given in terms of the
course deviation angle and its variance. It includes a few parameters:
individual sensitivity of the animal compass, the power of the herd instinct,
and the level of random noise. These parameters determine, among other factors,
the size of the group that is optimal for precise navigation. It is shown that
there is a range of the noise level, at which the aggregation of individuals
into groups that do not exceed a certain size would be favorable.

recognized as promising techniques in the Internet of Things (IoT) era to
provide massive low-power wireless devices with enhanced computation capability
and sustainable energy supply. In this paper, we propose a unified MEC-WPT
design by considering a wireless powered multiuser MEC system, where a
multi-antenna access point (AP) (integrated with an MEC server) broadcasts
wireless power to charge multiple users and each user node relies on the
harvested energy to execute computation tasks. With MEC, these users can
execute their respective tasks locally by themselves or offload all or part of
them to the AP based on a time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol.
Building on the proposed model, we develop an innovative framework to improve
the MEC performance, by jointly optimizing the energy transmit beamformer at
the AP, the central processing unit (CPU) frequencies and the numbers of
offloaded bits at the users, as well as the time allocation among users. Under
this framework, we address a practical scenario where latency-limited
computation is required. In this case, we develop an optimal resource
allocation scheme that minimizes the AP's total energy consumption subject to
the users' individual computation latency constraints. Leveraging the
state-of-the-art optimization techniques, we derive the optimal solution in a
semi-closed form. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed
design over alternative benchmark schemes.

transitions in their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality in
natural systems suggests that there may be general principles inducing this
behaviour. However, there is a lack of conceptual models explaining how
embodied agents propel themselves towards these critical points. In this paper,
we present a learning model driving an embodied Boltzmann Machine towards
critical behaviour by maximizing the heat capacity of the network. We test and
corroborate the model implementing an embodied agent in the mountain car
benchmark, controlled by a Boltzmann Machine that adjust its weights according
to the model. We find that the neural controller reaches a point of
criticality, which coincides with a transition point of the behaviour of the
agent between two regimes of behaviour, maximizing the synergistic information
between its sensors and the hidden and motor neurons. Finally, we discuss the
potential of our learning model to study the contribution of criticality to the
behaviour of embodied living systems in scenarios not necessarily constrained
by biological restrictions of the examples of criticality we find in nature.

parts in an image, and serves as a pre-processing step for a variety of

procedure must be as fast and compact as possible and optimally processes input
images in a real time manner. It is an essential application requirement for
the saliency detection task. However, contemporary detection methods often
utilize some complicated procedures to pursue feeble improvements on the

proposing a fast and compact saliency score regression network which employs
fully convolutional network, a special deep convolutional neural network, to

full-resolution saliency map (image-to-image prediction). It works like a
compact pipeline which effectively simplifies the detection procedure. Our
method is evaluated on six public datasets, and experimental results show that
it can achieve comparable or better precision performance than the

dislikes), as well as items that are goods to some agents, but bads or satiated
to others.
  If all items are goods and utility functions are homothetic, concave (and
monotone), the Competitive Equilibrium with Equal Incomes maximizes the Nash
product of utilities: hence it is welfarist (determined utility-wise by the
feasible set of profiles), single-valued and easy to compute.
  We generalize the Gale-Eisenberg Theorem to a mixed manna. The Competitive
division is still welfarist and related to the product of utilities or
disutilities. If the zero utility profile (before any manna) is Pareto
dominated, the competitive profile is unique and still maximizes the product of
utilities. If the zero profile is unfeasible, the competitive profiles are the
critical points of the product of disutilities on the efficiency frontier, and
multiplicity is pervasive. In particular the task of dividing a mixed manna is
either good news for everyone, or bad news for everyone.
  We refine our results in the practically important case of linear
preferences, where the axiomatic comparison between the division of goods and
that of bads is especially sharp. When we divide goods and the manna improves,
everyone weakly benefits under the competitive rule; but no reasonable rule to
divide bads can be similarly Resource Monotonic. Also, the much larger set of
Non Envious and Efficient divisions of bads can be disconnected so that it will
admit no continuous selection.

this work we propose transcript length as a further key determinant of
translation efficiency. Based on a physical model that considers the kinetics
of ribosomes advancing on the mRNA and diffusing in its surrounding, as well as
mRNA circularisation and ribosome drop-off, we explain how the transcript
length may play a central role in establishing ribosome recruitment and the
overall translation rate of an mRNA. According to our results, the proximity of
the 3' end to the ribosomal recruitment site of the mRNA could induce a
feedback in the translation process that would favour the recycling of
ribosomes. We also demonstrate how this process may be involved in shaping the
experimental ribosome density-gene length dependence. Finally, we argue that
cells could exploit this mechanism to adjust and balance the usage of its
ribosomal resources.

role in tumour evolution and the emergence of resistance to treatment. It is
increasingly recognised that the study of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns along
the genome -- so-called `epialleles' -- offers greater insight into epigenetic
dynamics than conventional analyses which examine DNAm marks individually.
  Results: We have developed a Bayesian model to infer which epialleles are
present in multiple regions of the same tumour. We apply our method to reduced
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from multiple regions of one
lung cancer tumour and a matched normal sample. The model borrows information
from all tumour regions to leverage greater statistical power. The total number
of epialleles, the epiallele DNAm patterns, and a noise hyperparameter are all
automatically inferred from the data. Uncertainty as to which epiallele an
observed sequencing read originated from is explicitly incorporated by
marginalising over the appropriate posterior densities. The degree to which
tumour samples are contaminated with normal tissue can be estimated and
corrected for. By tracing the distribution of epialleles throughout the tumour
we can infer the phylogenetic history of the tumour, identify epialleles that
differ between normal and cancer tissue, and define a measure of global
epigenetic disorder.

consider control through instantaneous Gaussian unitary operations on the

thermal noise. This is done by isolating the parameters that encode entropy and
temperature and by deriving an equation for their evolution. This equation is
in such a form that it grants clear insight into how relaxation may be helped
by instantaneous quantum control. It is thus shown that squeezing is a crucial
element in optimising the rate of change of entropic properties under these

arbitrarily small distance from the fixed point of the lossy channel with

the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct
observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of
hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of non-local
spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range
antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our
technique demonstrates how topological order can directly be measured in

profiles of the electric double layer forming at the interface due to the
permanent influx of electrons and ions from the plasma. The two sets of
Boltzmann equations are connected by quantum-mechanical matching conditions for
the electron distribution functions and a semi-empirical model for hole
injection mimicking the neutralization of ions at the surface. Essential for
the kinetic modeling is the ambipolarity inside the wall, leading to an
electron-hole recombination condition, and the merging of the double layer with
the quasi-neutral, field-free regions deep inside the wall and the plasma. To
indicate the feasibility as well as the potential of the approach we apply it
to a collisionless, perfectly absorbing interface using intrinsic and extrinsic
silicon dioxide and silicon surfaces in contact with a two-temperature hydrogen

uniformly-quantized stochastic process divided by minus the logarithm of the
quantizer step size $1/m$ in the limit as $m\to\infty$. It is demonstrated that
the information dimension rate coincides with the rate-distortion dimension,
defined as twice the rate-distortion function $R(D)$ of the stochastic process
divided by $-\log(D)$ in the limit as $D\downarrow 0$. It is further shown
that, among all multivariate stationary processes with a given (matrix-valued)
spectral distribution function (SDF), the Gaussian process has the largest
information dimension rate, and that the information dimension rate of
multivariate stationary Gaussian processes is given by the average rank of the
derivative of the SDF. The presented results reveal that the fundamental limits

scaled their result to the ratio of the up- and down flux measured just before

find a significantly higher overall reflectance. We attribute this to a phase
angle dependance, possibly representing the opposition surge commonly
encountered on solar system bodies. The reconstruction in the visible

red slope, consistent with the presence of organic material. We confirm the
blue slope in the near-IR, featureless apart from a single shallow absorption
feature at 1500 nm. We agree with Tomasko et al. that the evidence for water
ice is inconclusive. By modeling of absorption bands we find a methane mixing

of them. Furthermore, we estimate that for the same flux limit of $10^{-12}$
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, the energy range above 10 GeV has twice as many sources
as above 50 GeV, highlighting the importance, for future Cherenkov telescopes,
of lowering the energy threshold as much as possible.

proposed Orlicz space formalism for Quantum theory \cite{ML}, and secondly to
show how noncommutative differential structures may naturally be incorporated
into this framework. To start off with we specifically propose regularity
conditions which in the context of local algebras corresponding to Minkowski
space, ensure good behaviour of field operators as observables, and then show
that fields obtained by the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem are
regular in this sense. The pair of Orlicz spaces we explicitly use for this
purpose, are respectively built on the exponential function and on an entropic
type function. This formalism has been shown to be well suited to a description
of quantum statistical mechanics, and in the present work we show that it is
also a very useful and elegant tool for Quantum Field Theory. We then introduce
the class of tangentially conditioned algebras, which is a large class of local
algebras corresponding to globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds that locally
``look like'' the local algebras of Minkowski space. On the one hand this
ensures that at a local level, the Orlicz space formalism discussed above is
also relevant for a much more general class of local algebras. On the other
hand, the structure of this class of algebras, allows for the development of a
non-commutative differential geometric structure along the lines of the du
Bois-Violette approach to such a theory. In this way we obtain a complete
depiction: integrable structures based on local algebras provide a static
setting for an analysis of Quantum Field Theory and an effective tool for
describing regular behaviour of field operators, whereas differentiable
structures posit indispensable tools for a description of equations of motion.

measurements that indicate the probe did not immediately come to rest. Detailed
knowledge of the probe's motion can provide insight into the nature of Titan's
surface. Combining accelerometer data from the Huygens Atmospheric Structure
Instrument (HASI) and the Surface Science Package (SSP) with photometry data
from the Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) we develop a quantitative
model to describe motion of the probe, and its interaction with the surface.
The most likely scenario is the following. Upon impact, Huygens created a 12 cm
deep hole in the surface of Titan. It bounced back, out of the hole onto the
flat surface, after which it commenced a 30-40 cm long slide in the southward
direction. The slide ended with the probe out of balance, tilted in the
direction of DISR by around 10 degrees. The probe then wobbled back and forth
five times in the north-south direction, during which it probably encountered a
1-2 cm sized pebble. The SSP provides evidence for movement up to 10 s after
impact. This scenario puts the following constraints on the physical properties
of the surface. For the slide over the surface we determine a friction
coefficient of 0.4. While this value is not necessarily representative for the
surface itself due to the presence of protruding structures on the bottom of
the probe, the dynamics appear to be consistent with a surface consistency of
damp sand. Additionally, we find that spectral changes observed in the first
four seconds after landing are consistent with a transient dust cloud, created
by the impact of the turbulent wake behind the probe on the surface. The
optical properties of the dust particles are consistent with those of Titan
aerosols from Tomasko et al. (P&SS 56, 669). We suggest that the surface at the

observational probes. The temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background induced via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect may
provide interesting information since they are expected to receive significant
contribution from high-redshift plasma. We present a set of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations that include a treatment of the neutrino component
considering four different sum of neutrino masses: $\Sigma
m_\nu=(0,0.15,0.3,0.6)$ eV. Using their outputs, we modelled the kSZ effect due
to the large-scale structure after the reionization by producing mock maps,
then computed the kSZ power spectrum and studied how it depends on $z_{\rm re}$
and $\Sigma m_\nu$. We also run a set of four simulations to study and correct
possible systematics due to resolution, finite box size and astrophysics. With
massless neutrinos we obtain $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}=4.0$ $\mu {\rm K}^2$
($z_{\rm re}$=8.8), enough to account for all of the kSZ signal of
$\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}=(2.9\pm1.3)$ $\mu {\rm K}^2$ measured with the
South Pole Telescope. This translates into an upper limit on the kSZ effect due
to patchy reionization of $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ,patchy}_{3000}<1.0$ $\mu {\rm
K}^2$ (95 per cent confidence level). Massive neutrinos induce a damping of kSZ
effect power of about 8, 12 and 40 per cent for $\Sigma m_\nu=(0.15,0.3,0.6)$
eV, respectively. We study the dependence of the kSZ signal with $z_{\rm re}$
and the neutrino mass fraction, $f_\nu$, and obtain $\mathcal{D}^{\rm
kSZ}_{3000}\propto z_{\rm re}^{0.26}(1-f_\nu)^{14.3}$. Interestingly, the
scaling with $f_\nu$ is significantly shallower with respect to the equivalent
thermal SZ effect, and may be used to break the degeneracy with other
cosmological parameters.

with the potential to impact group IV semiconductor devices. Indeed, the
ability to independently engineer both lattice parameter and band gap holds the
premise to develop enhanced or novel photonic, optoelectronic, and electronic
devices. With this perspective, we present detailed investigations of the
influence of Ge1-y-xSixSny layers on the optical properties of Si- and Ge-based
heterostructures and nanowires. We found that adding a thin Ge1-x-ySixSny
capping layer on Si or Ge greatly enhances light absorption especially in the
near IR range leading to an increase in short-circuit current density. For the
Ge1-y-xSixSny structure at thicknesses below 30 nm, a 14-fold increase in the
short-circuit current is predicted with respect to bare Si. This enhancement
decreases by reducing the capping layer thickness. Conversely, decreasing the
shell thickness was found to improve the short-circuit current in
Si/Ge1-y-xSixSny and Ge/Ge1-y-xSixSny core/shell nanowires. The optical
absorption becomes very important when increasing the Sn content. Moreover, by
exploiting optical antenna effect, these nanowires show an extreme light
absorption reaching an enhancement factor, with respect to Si or Ge nanowires,
on the order of ~104 in Si/Ge0.84Si0.04Sn0.12 and ~12 in Ge/Ge0.84Si0.04Sn0.12

addition of a dielectric capping layer consisting of Si3N4 to the

short-circuit current density for a dielectric layer thickness of 45 nm and a
core radius and shell thickness superior to 40 nm. The core/shell optical
antenna benefits from a multiplication of enhancements contributed by leaky
mode resonances in the semiconductor part and antireflection effects in the

property of any interface. However, measurements of solid surface stress in
traditional engineering materials, such as metals and oxides, have proven to be
very challenging. Consequently, our understanding relies heavily on untested
theories, especially regarding the strain dependence of this property. Here, we
take advantage of the high compliance and large elastic deformability of a soft
polymer gel to directly measure solid surface stress as a function of strain.
As anticipated by theoretical work for metals, we find that the surface stress
depends on the strain via a surface modulus. Remarkably, the surface modulus of
our soft gels is many times larger than the zero-strain surface tension. This
suggests that surfaces stresses can play a dominant role in solid mechanics at
much larger length scales than previously anticipated.

typical for a collinear antiferromagnet and the latter is believed to be a
spin-flip transition of canted moments. The canted moments, which are induced

canted moments are aligned along the field direction. Density functional theory
was employed to compute the exchange interactions, which were used as inputs

Quasi-Newton (IQN) method proposed here belongs to the family of stochastic and
incremental methods that have a cost per iteration independent of $n$. IQN
iterations are a stochastic version of BFGS iterations that use memory to
reduce the variance of stochastic approximations. The convergence properties of
IQN bridge a gap between deterministic and stochastic quasi-Newton methods.
Deterministic quasi-Newton methods exploit the possibility of approximating the
Newton step using objective gradient differences. They are appealing because
they have a smaller computational cost per iteration relative to Newton's
method and achieve a superlinear convergence rate under customary regularity
assumptions. Stochastic quasi-Newton methods utilize stochastic gradient
differences in lieu of actual gradient differences. This makes their
computational cost per iteration independent of the number of objective
functions $n$. However, existing stochastic quasi-Newton methods have sublinear
or linear convergence at best. IQN is the first stochastic quasi-Newton method
proven to converge superlinearly in a local neighborhood of the optimal
solution. IQN differs from state-of-the-art incremental quasi-Newton methods in
three aspects: (i) The use of aggregated information of variables, gradients,
and quasi-Newton Hessian approximation matrices to reduce the noise of gradient
and Hessian approximations. (ii) The approximation of each individual function
by its Taylor's expansion in which the linear and quadratic terms are evaluated
with respect to the same iterate. (iii) The use of a cyclic scheme to update
the functions in lieu of a random selection routine. We use these fundamental
properties of IQN to establish its local superlinear convergence rate.

models commonly compute several feature maps (contrast, orientation, motion...)

different spatial distribution and amplitude dynamic ranges, determining their
contributions to overall saliency remains an open problem. Most
state-of-the-art models do not take time into account and give feature maps
constant weights across the stimulus duration. However, visual exploration is a
highly dynamic process shaped by many time-dependent factors. For instance,
some systematic viewing patterns such as the center bias are known to
dramatically vary across the time course of the exploration. In this paper, we
use maximum likelihood and shrinkage methods to dynamically and jointly learn
feature map and systematic viewing pattern weights directly from eye-tracking
data recorded on videos. We show that these weights systematically vary as a
function of time, and heavily depend upon the semantic visual category of the
videos being processed. Our fusion method allows taking these variations into

exhibit high performance overheads preventing them from wide adoption in
production runs. To address this issue, Intel recently released a new ISA
extension - Memory Protection Extensions (Intel MPX), a hardware-assisted
full-stack solution to protect against memory safety violations. In this work,
we perform an exhaustive study of the Intel MPX architecture to understand its
advantages and caveats. We base our study along three dimensions: (a)
performance overheads, (b) security guarantees, and (c) usability issues. To
put our results in perspective, we compare Intel MPX with three prominent
software-based approaches: (1) trip-wire - AddressSanitizer, (2) object-based -
SAFECode, and (3) pointer-based - SoftBound. Our main conclusion is that Intel
MPX is a promising technique that is not yet practical for widespread adoption.
Intel MPX's performance overheads are still high (roughly 50% on average), and
the supporting infrastructure has bugs which may cause compilation or runtime
errors. Moreover, we showcase the design limitations of Intel MPX: it cannot
detect temporal errors, may have false positives and false negatives in
multithreaded code, and its restrictions on memory layout require substantial
code changes for some programs.

rapidly spinning neutron star is carried away by a relativistic wind and
deposited at a large distance, in the nebula, downstream of the wind
termination shock. The energy transport in the outflow is mediated by Poynting
flux, but it is not clear how the energy stored in the fields is transferred
into the energized population of emitting particles. The most plausible
dissipation mechanisms are thought to be related to the ""striped"" structure of
the wind, in particular, to the existence of a current sheet, prone to
reconnection events. In this model the current sheet is a natural place for
internal dissipation and acceleration of particles responsible for pulsed,
high-energy emission. Moreover, reconnection is a promising scenario for
explaining annihilation of fields at the shock and conversion of their energy
into the kinetic energy of particles. The shock structure, however, is likely
to differ in the low-density plasmas, in which non-MHD effects intervene. In
this regime, the striped wind can dissipate its energy via an electromagnetic
precursor of the shock.

the Dirac Hamiltonian. We derive the corresponding evolution equation for the
Wigner quasi-distribution in an external electromagnetic field. Using a
Lagrangian method we find expressions for the charge and current densities,

non-trivially related to the momentum variable, with the difference depending
on the spin and the external electromagnetic fields. This fact that has

longer constrained to stay between the plates, but instead spill out into the
surrounding electrolyte. The resulting reduction in the disjoining pressure is
calculated analytically. A similar reduction of disjoining pressure due to loss
of lateral confinement of the Debye layer charges should occur whenever the
sizes of the interacting charged objects become small enough to approach the
Debye scale. We investigate the effect here in the context of a two dimensional
model problem that is sufficiently simple to yield analytical results.

block users who post spam tweets. In this paper, we propose a Semi-Supervised
Spam Detection (S3D) framework for spam detection at tweet-level. The proposed
framework consists of two main modules: spam detection module operating in
real-time mode, and model update module operating in batch mode. The spam
detection module consists of four light-weight detectors: (i) blacklisted
domain detector to label tweets containing blacklisted URLs, (ii)
near-duplicate detector to label tweets that are near-duplicates of confidently
pre-labeled tweets, (iii) reliable ham detector to label tweets that are posted
by trusted users and that do not contain spammy words, and (iv)
multi-classifier based detector labels the remaining tweets. The information
required by the detection module are updated in batch mode based on the tweets
that are labeled in the previous time window. Experiments on a large scale
dataset show that the framework adaptively learns patterns of new spam
activities and maintain good accuracy for spam detection in a tweet stream.

means of a variable coefficient modified nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation
(Vc-MNLSE) with distributed dispersion, self-phase modulation, self-steepening
and linear gain/loss. The ultrashort dark soliton pulse evolution and
interaction is studied by using the Hirota bilinear (HB) method. In particular,
we give much insight into the effect of self-steepening (SS) on the dark
soliton dynamics. The study reveals a shock wave formation, as a major effect
of SS. Numerically, we study the dark soliton propagation in the continuous
wave background, and the stability of the soliton solution is tested in the
presence of photon noise. The elastic collision behaviors of the dark solitons
are discussed by the asymptotic analysis. On the other hand, considering the
nonlinear tunneling of dark soliton through barrier/well, we find that the
tunneling of the dark soliton depends on the height of the barrier and the
amplitude of the soliton. The intensity of the tunneling soliton either forms a
peak or valley and retains its shape after the tunneling. For the case of
exponential background, the soliton tends to compress after tunneling through
the barrier/well.

for massive, systematic, and remote or casual collection of personal
information about people. Biosensors capture physiological signals in addition
to kinesthetic data to draw intimate inferences about individuals' mental
states. The proliferation of sensors makes detection, interpretation, and
inference of these previously subtle - or otherwise invisible - emotional and
physiological signals possible from proximate and remote locations. These
sensors pose unprecedented challenges to individual privacy in public through
remote, precise, and passively collected data. This paper examines the unique
nature and inferential potential of biosensed data by creating a taxonomy of
signals that may be collected remotely, via casual contact, or from traces left
behind, and considers how these data may be collected and used to create novel
privacy concerns - particularly in public. Since biosignals may often be
deduced from visual data, this paper uses historic and recent photography cases
to explore how social norms evolved in response to remote collection in public.
A contextual integrity privacy heuristic is then used to probe the need for new
norms and remedies specifically for biosensing privacy threats. This analysis
examines the extensibility of relevant legal frameworks in the European Union
(EU) and United States (US) as a privacy remedy, and conclude with a brief
outline of possible legal or social remedies that may address privacy needs in
public with biosensing technologies.

importance for Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their energy

expected to facilitate a wide array of location based services for IoT
applications with low-power requirements. In this paper, considering monostatic
and bistatic configurations and 3D antenna radiation pattern, we investigate
the accuracy of received signal strength based wireless localization using
passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID systems. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) for the localization accuracy is derived, and is compared with the
accuracy of maximum likelihood estimators for various RFID antenna
configurations. Numerical results show that due to RFID tag/antenna
sensitivity, and the directional antenna pattern, the localization accuracy can
degrade at blind locations that remain outside of the RFID reader antennas'
main beam patterns. In such cases optimizing elevation angle of antennas are
shown to improve localization coverage, while using bistatic configuration
improves localization accuracy significantly.
