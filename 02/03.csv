picture. However, recent suggestions of non-zero magnetism have raised some
fundamental questions about its origin. Focussing on the phonon dynamics,
probed via Raman scattering, as a function of temperature and different
incident photon energies, as an external perturbation. Our studies reveal
strong renormalization of the phonon self-energy parameters and integrated
intensity for first-order modes, especially redshift of the few first-order
modes with decreasing temperature and anomalous softening of modes associated
with IrO6 octahedra, as well as high energy Raman bands attributed to the
strong anharmonic phonons and coupling with orbital excitations. The distinct
renormalization of second-order Raman bands with respect to their first-order
counterpart suggest that higher energy Raman bands have significant
contribution from orbital excitations. Our observation indicates that strong
anharmonic phonons coupled with electronic/orbital degrees of freedom provides
a knob for tuning the conventional electronic levels for 5d-orbitals, and this
may give rise to non-zero magnetism as postulated in recent theoretical
calculations with rich magnetic phases.

proving its absence) would provide valuable insights into our understanding of
galaxy formation and evolution. However, it is challenging to identify a unique
signature of an IMBH that cannot be accounted for by other processes.
Observational claims of IMBH detection are indeed often based on analyses of
the kinematics of stars in the cluster core, the most common signature being a
rise in the velocity dispersion profile towards the centre of the system.
Unfortunately, this IMBH signal is degenerate with the presence of
radially-biased pressure anisotropy in the globular cluster. To explore the
role of anisotropy in shaping the observational kinematics of clusters, we
analyse the case of omega Cen by comparing the observed profiles to those
calculated from the family of LIMEPY models, that account for the presence of
anisotropy in the system in a physically motivated way. The best-fit radially
anisotropic models reproduce the observational profiles well, and describe the
central kinematics as derived from Hubble Space Telescope proper motions
without the need for an IMBH.

certain phenomena as accurately as possible. Climatology is a prime example,
where the temporal evolution of the climate is modeled. In order to compare and
improve different models, methodology for a fair model evaluation is
indispensable. As models and forecasts of a phenomenon are usually associated
with uncertainty, proper scoring rules, which are tools that account for this
kind of uncertainty, are an adequate choice for model evaluation. However,
under the presence of non-stationarity, such a model evaluation becomes
challenging, as the characteristics of the phenomenon of interest change. We
provide methodology for model evaluation in the context of non-stationary time
series. Our methodology assumes stationarity of the time series in shorter
moving time windows. These moving windows, which are selected based on a
changepoint analysis, are used to characterize the uncertainty of the
phenomenon/model for the corresponding time instances. This leads to the
concept of moving scores allowing for a temporal assessment of the model
performance. The merits of the proposed methodology are illustrated in a
simulation and a case study.

opportunities to probe pulsar emission models. The Fermi Large Area Telescope
(LAT) has now detected over 200 gamma-ray pulsars of vastly different ages,
providing an extensive dataset of spectra and light curves compared to a mere
decade ago. Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes deepened our appreciation of the
mysterious richness of the pulsar mechanism by a surprise detection of pulsed
emission up to 1 TeV from the Crab pulsar. These discoveries position us to
make real progress in pulsar theory. A number of studies have developed new and
enhanced existing dissipative magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and particle-in-cell
(PIC) codes to solve the global electrodynamics and pursue fundamental
questions about magnetospheric particle injection, acceleration, and radiation.
While MHD models capture the global aspects of pulsar magnetospheres, the
microphysics need to be probed self-consistently by PIC simulations. Some
dissipative MHD models consider the current sheet (CS) as an important site for
high-energy curvature radiation (CR), while early PIC results point to energy
dissipation taking place in the CS, where particles are accelerated by magnetic
reconnection and may possibly emit $\gamma$ rays via synchrotron radiation
(SR). This is in marked contrast to some older local emission models that
studied CR gamma rays produced in gaps nearer to the spinning neutron star. The
universality of these results should become clearer as current computational
restrictions are overcome and boundary conditions are refined. Continued and
combined polarimetric, spectral, and temporal measurements should aid us in
scrutinising these new emission models in our persistent pursuit of a deeper
understanding of the pulsar marvel.

lepton. The contributions from dark matter co-annihilation channels are highly
relevant for a determination of the correct relic abundance. We investigate
these effects as well as the discovery potential for dark matter
co-annihilation partners at the LHC. A small mass splitting between the dark
matter and its partner is preferred by the co-annihilation mechanism and
suggests that the co-annihilation partners may be long-lived (stable or
meta-stable) at collider scales. It is argued that such long-lived electrically
charged particles can be looked for at the LHC in searches of anomalous charged
tracks. This approach and the underlying models provide an
alternative/complementarity to the mono-jet and multi-jet based dark matter
searches widely used in the context of simplified models with the s-channel
mediators. We consider four types of simplified models with different particle
spins and coupling structures. Some of these models are manifestly gauge
invariant and renormalizable, others would ultimately require a UV completion.
These can be realised in terms of supersymmetric models in the neutralino-stau

increasing attention recently. Subject to the ill-posed gradient difficulty in
the optimization with sign activations, existing deep learning to hash methods
need to first learn continuous representations and then generate binary hash
codes in a separated binarization step, which suffer from substantial loss of
retrieval quality. This work presents HashNet, a novel deep architecture for
deep learning to hash by continuation method with convergence guarantees, which
learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data. The key idea
is to attack the ill-posed gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with
non-smooth binary activations by continuation method, in which we begin from
learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve
during the training, until it eventually goes back to being the original,
difficult to optimize, deep network with the sign activation function.
Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that HashNet can generate exactly binary

knowledge. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and in natural language

fading away, erased by vectors or tensors called distributed and distributional
representations. However, there is a strict link between
distributed/distributional representations and discrete symbols, being the
first an approximation of the second. A clearer understanding of the strict
link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols may
certainly lead to radically new deep learning networks. In this paper we make a
survey that aims to renew the link between symbolic representations and
distributed/distributional representations. This is the right time to
revitalize the area of interpreting how discrete symbols are represented inside
neural networks.

problems on graphs. This framework is simultaneously general enough to
encompass many other counting problems on graphs and specific enough to allow
the derivation of dichotomy results, partitioning all problem instances into
those which can be solved in polynomial time and those which are #P-hard. The
Holant framework is based on the theory of holographic algorithms, which was
originally inspired by concepts from quantum computation, but this connection
appears not to have been explored before.
  Here, we employ quantum information theory to explain existing results in a
concise way and to derive a dichotomy for a new family of problems, which we
call Holant$^+$. This family sits in between the known families of Holant$^*$,
for which a full dichotomy is known, and Holant$^c$, for which only a
restricted dichotomy is known. Using knowledge from entanglement theory -- both
previously existing work and new results of our own -- we prove a full
dichotomy theorem for Holant$^+$, which is very similar to the restricted
Holant$^c$ dichotomy. Other than the dichotomy for #R$_3$-CSP, ours is the
first Holant dichotomy in which the allowed functions are not restricted and in
which only a finite number of functions are assumed to be freely available.

heating agents. Yet, the waves detected so far may be but a small subset of the
true existing wave power. Detection is limited by instrumental constraints, but
also by wave processes that localise the wave power in undetectable spatial
scales. In this study we conduct 3D MHD simulations and forward modelling of
standing transverse MHD waves in coronal loops with uniform and non-uniform
temperature variation in the perpendicular cross-section. The observed
signatures are largely dominated by the combination of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI), resonant absorption and phase mixing. In the presence of a
cross-loop temperature gradient we find that emission lines sensitive to the
loop core catch different signatures than those more sensitive to the loop
boundary and the surrounding corona, leading to an out-of-phase intensity
modulation produced by the KHI mixing. Common signatures to all considered
models include an intensity and loop width modulation at half the kink period,
fine strand-like structure, a characteristic arrow-shaped structure in the
Doppler maps, overall line broadening in time but particularly at the loop
edges. For our model, most of these features can be captured with a spatial
resolution of $0.33\arcsec$ and spectral resolution of 25~km~s$^{-1}$, although
severe over-estimation of the line width is obtained. Resonant absorption leads
to a significant decrease of the observed kinetic energy from Doppler motions
over time, which is not recovered by a corresponding increase in the line width
from phase mixing and the KHI motions. We estimate this hidden wave energy to
be a factor of $5-10$ of the observed value.

reveals a trade-off: aggressively signaling at a high rate stresses the

for several decades offered an unprecedented window into nonlinear cavity
dynamics, providing insights into numerous systems and applications ranging
from all-optical memory devices to microresonator frequency combs. Yet despite
the decades of study, a recent theoretical study has surprisingly alluded to an
entirely new and unexplored paradigm in the regime where nonlinearly tilted
cavity resonances overlap with one another [T. Hansson and S. Wabnitz, J. Opt.
Soc. Am. B 32, 1259 (2015)]. We have used synchronously driven fiber ring
resonators to experimentally access this regime, and observed the rise of new
nonlinear dissipative states. Specifically, we have observed, for the first
time to the best of our knowledge, the stable coexistence of dissipative
(cavity) solitons and extended modulation instability (Turing) patterns, and
performed real time measurements that unveil the dynamics of the ensuing
nonlinear structures. When operating in the regime of continuous wave
tristability, we have further observed the coexistence of two distinct cavity
soliton states, one of which can be identified as a ""super"" cavity soliton as
predicted by Hansson and Wabnitz. Our experimental findings are in excellent
agreement with theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of the
infinite-dimensional Ikeda map that governs the cavity dynamics. The results

stage, and by electrostatic whistler waves in the nonlinear stage. Modulational
instability leads to Langmuir collapse and electron heating that fills in
cavitons. The high pressure is released via excitation of a short wavelength
ion acoustic mode that is damped by electrons and that re-excites small-scale
Langmuir waves---this process closes a feedback loop that maintains the

have also discovered six M7-L1 dwarfs in outlying regions of Scorpius-Centaurus

emission confined to within ~1 year. Here we report the discovery of a well
observed super-long (>11 years) luminous soft X-ray flare from the nuclear
region of a dwarf starburst galaxy. After an apparently fast rise within ~4
months a decade ago, the X-ray luminosity, though showing a weak trend of
decay, has been persistently high at around the Eddington limit (when the
radiation pressure balances the gravitational force). The X-ray spectra are
generally soft (steeply declining towards higher energies) and can be described
with Comptonized emission from an optically thick low-temperature corona, a
super-Eddington accretion signature often observed in accreting stellar-mass
black holes. Dramatic spectral softening was also caught in one recent
observation, implying either a temporary transition from the super-Eddington
accretion state to the standard thermal state or the presence of a transient
highly blueshifted (~0.36c) warm absorber. All these properties in concert
suggest a tidal disruption event of an unusually long super-Eddington accretion

dominated by geometric effects, and the overall luminosities are extremely
strong functions of the properties of the host system, as observed in

maximum velocities in several models are consistent with emission-line
observations of ULIRGs, although the velocities are significantly greater than

perturbative corrections. These partially arise from large virtual corrections
to the gluon form factor, which at timelike momentum transfer contains Sudakov
logarithms evaluated at negative arguments $\ln^2(-1) = -\pi^2$. It has been
observed that resumming these terms in the timelike form factor leads to a much
improved perturbative convergence for the total cross section. We discuss how
to consistently incorporate the resummed form factor into the perturbative
predictions for generic cross sections differential in the Born kinematics,
including in particular the Higgs rapidity spectrum. We verify that this indeed
improves the perturbative convergence, leading to smaller and more reliable
perturbative uncertainties, and that this is not affected by cancellations
between resummed and unresummed contributions. Combining both fixed-order and
resummation uncertainties, the perturbative uncertainty for the total cross
section at N$^3$LO$+$N$^3$LL$^\prime_\varphi$ is about a factor of two smaller
than at N$^3$LO. The perturbative uncertainty of the rapidity spectrum at
NNLO$+$NNLL$^\prime_\varphi$ is similarly reduced compared to NNLO. We also
study the analogous resummation for quark-induced processes, namely Higgs
production through bottom quark annihilation and the Drell-Yan rapidity

for the latter it confirms the already small uncertainties of the fixed-order

particular type of symmetry, i.e. a uniform or basic automorphism $\phi$, it is
possible to use $\phi$ to decompose a matrix $M$ appropriately associated with
the graph. The result is a number of strictly smaller matrices whose collective
eigenvalues are the same as the eigenvalues of the original matrix $M$. We show
here that a large class of automorphisms, which we refer to as
\emph{separable}, can be realized as a sequence of basic automorphisms,
allowing us to equitably decompose $M$ over any such automorphism. We also show
that not only can a matrix $M$ be decomposed but that the eigenvectors of $M$
can also be equitably decomposed. Additionally, we prove under mild conditions
that if a matrix $M$ is equitably decomposed the resulting divisor matrix,
which is the divisor matrix of the associated equitable partition, will have
the same spectral radius as the original matrix $M$. Last, we describe how an
equitable decomposition effects the Gershgorin region $\Gamma(M)$ of a matrix
$M$, which can be used to localize the eigenvalues of $M$. We show that the
Gershgorin region of an equitable decomposition of $M$ is contained in the
Gershgorin region $\Gamma(M)$ of the original matrix. We demonstrate on a
real-world network that by a sequence of equitable decompositions it is
possible to significantly reduce the size of a matrix' Gershgorin region.

the gain in fine tuning which they enable compared to extensions of the
Standard Model with colored top partners. Estimates show that, at least in the
simplest realizations of the TH idea, the separation between the mass of new
colored particles and the electroweak scale is controlled by the coupling
strength of the underlying UV theory, and that a parametric gain is achieved
only for strongly-coupled dynamics. Motivated by this consideration we focus on
one of these simple realizations, namely composite TH theories, and study how
well such constructions can reproduce electroweak precision data. The most
important effect of the Twin states is found to be the infrared contribution to
the Higgs quartic coupling, while direct corrections to electroweak observables
are sub-leading and negligible. We perform a careful fit to the electroweak
data including the leading-logarithmic corrections to the Higgs quartic up to
three loops. Our analysis shows that agreement with electroweak precision tests
can be achieved with only a moderate amount of tuning, in the range 5-10\%, in
theories where colored states have mass of order 3-5 TeV and are thus out of
reach of the LHC. For these levels of tuning, larger masses are excluded by a
perturbativity bound, which makes these theories possibly discoverable, hence
falsifiable, only at a future 100 TeV collider.

the jet energy and the jet mass are expected to be sensitive to jet quenching

coupling with the heat bath. Upon increasing the electrical current bias, the
formation of the metallic phase can progress smoothly or through sharp jumps.
The magnitude and threshold current values of these sharp resistance drops show
random behaviour and are dramatically influenced by thermal dissipation
conditions. Our results also evidence how the propagation of the metallic phase
induced by electrical current in $\mathrm{VO_2}$, and thus the shape of the
resulting high-conductivity path, are not predictable. We discuss the origin of
the switching events through a simple electro-thermal model based on the domain

normal--strength neutron star field implies super--Eddington accretion at the
magnetosphere. Adopting super--Eddington mass transfer as the defining
characteristic of ULX systems, we find the parameters required for
self--consistent simultaneous fits of the luminosities and spinup rates of the

becomes important and drives mass loss from the accretion disc. We interpret
this near--equality as a necessary condition for the systems to appear as
pulsed, since if it is violated the pulse fraction is small. We show that as a
consequence all PULXs must have spinup rates $\dot\nu \gtrsim 10^{-10}\, {\rm

the electronic and vibrational properties is investigated using surface
electron spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. For the surface mediated dissociation of H2 and the subsequent
adsorption of H, an energy barrier of 0.55 eV has to be overcome. The
calculated kinetic surface phase diagram indicates that the reaction is
kinetically hindered at low pressures and low temperatures. At higher
temperatures ab-initio thermodynamics show, that the H-free surface is
energetically favored. To validate these theoretical predictions experiments at
room temperature and under ultrahigh vacuum conditions were performed. They
reveal that molecular hydrogen does not dissociatively adsorb at the GaN(1-100)
surface. Only activated atomic hydrogen atoms attach to the surface. At
temperatures above 820 K, the attached hydrogen gets desorbed. The adsorbed
hydrogen atoms saturate the dangling bonds of the gallium and nitrogen surface
atoms and result in an inversion of the Ga-N surface dimer buckling. The
signatures of the Ga-H and N-H vibrational modes on the H-covered surface have
experimentally been identified and are in good agreement with the DFT
calculations of the surface phonon modes. Both theory and experiment show that
H adsorption results in a removal of occupied and unoccupied intragap electron
states of the clean GaN(1-100) surface and a reduction of the surface upward
band bending by 0.4 eV. The latter mechanism largely reduces surface electron
depletion.

increase errors in E[\rho] due to the failure to describe dynamic correlation

spacecraft and maintain contact, particularly when there is a major mission
anomaly or loss of contact. For these applications, we propose a backup laser
communication system where a laser is beamed towards a satellite and the
onboard photovoltaics acts as a laser receiver. This approach enables a laser
ground station to broadcast commands to the spacecraft in times of emergency.
Adding an actuated reflector to the laser receiver on the spacecraft enables
two-way communication between ground and the spacecraft, but without the laser
being located on the spacecraft. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of
the concept in the laboratory and develop a benchtop experiment to verify the

dust emission or both. Using a grid of models to fit the full observed spectra,
we estimate the most likely atmospheric parameters $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log(g)$,
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ and C/O. These parameters derived independently in the
optical and near-infrared are generally consistent when $(J-K_s)<1.6$. The
temperatures found based on either wavelength range are typically within
$\pm$100K of each other, and $\log(g)$ and $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ are consistent
with the values expected for this sample. The reddest stars ($(J-K_s)$ $>$ 1.6)

absorption feature at 1.53\,$\mu$m, generally associated with HCN and
C$_2$H$_2$. Stars from the first family begin to be more affected by
circumstellar extinction. The parameters found using optical or near-infrared
wavelengths are still compatible with each other, but the error bars become
larger. In stars showing the 1.53\,$\mu$m feature, which are all
large-amplitude variables, the effects of pulsation are strong and the spectra
are poorly matched with hydrostatic models. For these, atmospheric parameters

oxygen stoichiometry and promote oxygen vacancy drift in a free-standing
$\mathrm{(La,Sr)MnO_3}$ thin film microbridge placed in controlled atmosphere.
By controlling the local oxygen vacancies concentration, we can reversibly
switch our LSMO-based microbridges from metallic to insulating behavior on
timescales lower than 1 s and with small applied voltages (<5 V). The strong
temperature gradients given by the microbridge geometry strongly confine the
motion of oxygen vacancies, limiting the modified region within the
free-standing area. Multiple resistive states can be set by selected current
pulses that determine different oxygen vacancies profiles within the device .
Qualitative analysis of device operation is also provided with the support of
Finite Element Analysis.

systems of equations in modern science. It describes dynamics of fluids in the
limit when gradients of density, velocity and temperature are sufficiently
small, and loses its applicability when the flux becomes so non-equilibrium
that the changes of velocity, density or temperature on the length compatible
with the mean free path are non-negligible. The question is: how to model such
fluxes? This problem is still open. (Despite the fact that the first `final
equations of motion' modified for analysis of thermal creep in rarefied gas
were proposed by Maxwell in 1879.) There are, at least, three possible answers:
(i) use molecular dynamics with individual particles, (ii) use kinetic
equations, like Boltzmann's equation, or (iii) find a new system of equations
for description of fluid dynamics with better accounting of non-equilibrium
effects. These three approaches work at different scales. We explore the third
possibility using the recent findings of capillarity of internal layers in
ideal gases and of saturation effect in dissipation (there is a limiting
attenuation rate for very short waves in ideal gas and it cannot increase
infinitely). One candidate equation is discussed in more detail, the Korteweg
system proposed in 1901. The main ideas and approaches are illustrated by a
kinetic system for which the problem of reduction of kinetics to fluid dynamics
is analytically solvable.

photometry from imaging data through image registration, aperture photometry,
photometric calibration, and target identification with only minimal human
interaction. PP utilizes the widely used Source Extractor software for source
identification and aperture photometry; SCAMP is used for image registration.
Both image registration and photometric calibration are based on matching field
stars with star catalogs, requiring catalog coverage of the respective field. A
number of different astrometric and photometric catalogs can be queried online.
Relying on a sufficient number of background stars for image registration and
photometric calibration, PP is well-suited to analyze data from small to
medium-sized telescopes. Calibrated magnitudes obtained by PP are typically
accurate within 0.03 mag and astrometric accuracies are of the order of 0.3
arcsec relative to the catalogs used in the registration. The pipeline consists
of an open-source software suite written in Python 2.7, can be run on
Unix-based systems on a simple desktop machine, and is capable of realtime data
analysis. PP has been developed for observations of moving targets, but can be
used for analyzing point source observations of any kind.

the practitioners do not know whether at the threshold point the true

continuity or discontinuity at the threshold point and develop robust inference
methods on the parameters of the model, which are valid under both
specifications. In particular, we found that the parameter values under the
kink restriction are irregular points of the Hessian matrix of the expected
Gaussian quasi-likelihood. This irregularity destroys the asymptotic normality
and induces the non-standard cube root convergence rate for the threshold
estimate. However, it also enables us to obtain the same asymptotic
distribution as in Hansen (2000) for the quasi-likelihood ratio statistic for
the unknown threshold up to an unknown scale parameter. We show that this scale
parameter can be consistently estimated by a kernel method as long as no higher
order kernel is used. Furthermore, we propose to construct confidence intervals
for the unknown threshold by bootstrap test inversion, also known as grid
bootstrap. Finite sample performances of the grid bootstrap confidence
intervals are examined through Monte Carlo simulations. We also implement our
procedure to an economic empirical application.

many small antennas. The signals are combined to form one large, virtual
telescope. The enormous data streams are cross-correlated to filter out noise.
This is especially challenging, since the computational demands grow
quadratically with the number of data streams. Moreover, the correlator is not
only computationally intensive, but also very I/O intensive. The LOFAR
telescope, for instance, will produce over 100 terabytes per day. The future
SKA telescope will even require in the order of exaflops, and petabits/s of
I/O. A recent trend is to correlate in software instead of dedicated hardware,
to increase flexibility and to reduce development efforts.
  We evaluate the correlator algorithm on multi-core CPUs and many-core
architectures, such as NVIDIA and ATI GPUs, and the Cell/B.E. The correlator is
a streaming, real-time application, and is much more I/O intensive than
applications that are typically implemented on many-core hardware today. We
compare with the LOFAR production correlator on an IBM Blue Gene/P
supercomputer. We investigate performance, power efficiency, and
programmability. We identify several important architectural problems which
cause architectures to perform suboptimally. Our findings are applicable to
data-intensive applications in general.
  The processing power and memory bandwidth of current GPUs are highly
imbalanced for correlation purposes. While the production correlator on the
Blue Gene/P achieves a superb 96% of the theoretical peak performance, this is
only 16% on ATI GPUs, and 32% on NVIDIA GPUs. The Cell/B.E. processor, in
contrast, achieves an excellent 92%. We found that the Cell/B.E. and NVIDIA
GPUs are the most energy-efficient solutions, they run the correlator at least
4 times more energy efficiently than the Blue Gene/P.

about their origins, and hence on whether they play a role in fueling ongoing
star formation in the Galaxy. However, accurate interpretation of these
measurements requires compensating for the galactic material that has been
mixed into the clouds. In order to determine how much the metallicity changes
as a result of this mixing, we have carried out three-dimensional
wind-tunnel-like hydrodynamical simulations of an example cloud. Our model
cloud is patterned after the Smith Cloud, a particularly well-studied cloud of
mass $\sim 5 \times 10^6~M_\odot$. We calculated the fraction of the
high-velocity material that had originated in the galactic halo,
$F_\mathrm{h}$, for various sight lines passing through our model cloud. We
find that $F_\mathrm{h}$ generally increases with distance from the head of the
cloud, reaching $\sim$0.5 in the tail of the cloud. Models in which the
metallicities (relative to solar) of the original cloud, $Z_\mathrm{cl}$, and
of the halo, $Z_\mathrm{h}$, are in the approximate ranges $0.1 \lesssim
Z_\mathrm{cl} \lesssim 0.3$ and $0.7 \lesssim Z_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 1.0$,
respectively, are in rough agreement with the observations. Models with
$Z_\mathrm{h} \sim 0.1$ and $Z_\mathrm{cl} \gtrsim 0.5$ are also in rough
agreement with the observations, but such a low halo metallicity is
inconsistent with recent independent measurements. We conclude that the Smith
Cloud's observed metallicity may not be a true reflection of its original
metallicity and that the cloud's ultimate origin remains uncertain.

this change, the predicted LBG clustering increases significantly on
quasi-linear scales ($0.1 \leq r\,/\,h^{-1} \,{\rm Mpc} \leq 10$) compared to
that in the linear halo bias model. This in turn results in an increase in the
clustering of LBGs by an order of magnitude on angular scales $5"" \leq \theta

the systematic discrepancy between the linear halo bias predictions and the
observations. The correlation length and large scale galaxy bias of LBGs are
found to be significantly higher in the non-linear halo bias model than in the
linear halo bias model. The resulting two-point correlation function retains an
approximate power-law form in contrast with that computed using the linear halo
bias theory. We also find that the non-linear clustering of LBGs increases with

vehicle's control system must infer and predict how humans will behave based on
their latent internal state (e.g., intentions and aggressiveness). This
research uses a simple model for human behavior with unknown parameters that
make up the internal states of the traffic participants and presents a method
for quantifying the value of estimating these states and planning with their
uncertainty explicitly modeled. An upper performance bound is established by an
omniscient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner that has perfect knowledge of
the internal states. A baseline lower bound is established by planning with
MCTS assuming that all drivers have the same internal state. MCTS variants are
then used to solve a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that
models the internal state uncertainty to determine whether inferring the
internal state offers an advantage over the baseline. Applying this method to a
freeway lane changing scenario reveals that there is a significant performance
gap between the upper bound and baseline. POMDP planning techniques come close
to closing this gap, especially when important hidden model parameters are
correlated with measurable parameters.

differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we revisit its solutions, seeking,
in particular, self-similar profiles. This problem connects to the classical
theory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as
the Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the
original diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated
self-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion
amplitude is {\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer
setups of {\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem
in which the solution decays at a {\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we
observe that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among
integrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass. Hence, unless
the projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the
slowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue
that arises is whether the boundary data are \textit{consonant} with the
initial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the
solution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this
solution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain. In that case, the power
law dictated by the solution of the Cauchy problem will be selected. On the
other hand, in the non-consonant cases a decomposition of the problem into a
self-similar and a non-self-similar one is seen to be beneficial in obtaining a
systematic understanding of the resulting solution.

in the presence of quantizing external magnetic fields. The asymmetric
potential of four side-gates distorts the otherwise flat bands of the
relativistic Landau levels, and creates new propagating states in the Landau
spectrum (i.e. snake states). The existence of these new states leads to an
interesting modification of the bend and Hall resistances, with new quantizing
plateaus appearing in close proximity of the Landau levels. The electron
guiding in this system can be understood by studying the current density
profiles of the incoming and outgoing modes. From the fact that guided
electrons fully transmit without any backscattering (similarly to edge states),
we are able to analytically predict the values of quantized resistances, and
they match the resistance data we obtain with our numerical (tight-binding)
method. These insights in the electron guiding will be useful in predicting the
resistances for other side-gate configurations, and possibly in other system
geometries, as long as there is no backscattering of the guided states.

that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the
neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions
between recorded neurons and the ""hidden"" portion of the network. To properly
interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to
neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the
relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true
underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective
spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are
reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective
interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron $r'$ to a post-synaptic neuron $r$ can
be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from $r'$ to $r$ plus
corrections from every directed path from $r'$ to $r$ through unobserved
neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units
have---or do not have---major effects on reshaping the interactions among
observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for
the impact of hidden units in random networks with ""strong""
coupling---connection weights that scale with $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the
network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this
quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study
how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are
relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.

the study of Hamiltonian models for discrete higher gauge theory on a lattice
decomposition of a manifold. In particular, we show that a previously proposed
construction for higher lattice gauge theory is well-defined, including in
particular a Hamiltonian for topological phases of matter in 3+1 dimensions.
Our construction builds upon the Kitaev quantum double model, replacing the
finite gauge connection with a finite gauge 2-group 2-connection. Our
Hamiltonian higher lattice gauge theory model is defined on spatial manifolds
of arbitrary dimension presented by slightly {\it combinatorialised}
CW-decompositions (2-lattice decompositions), whose 1-cells and 2-cells carry
discrete 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional holonomy data. We prove that the
ground-state degeneracy of Hamiltonian higher lattice gauge theory is a
topological invariant of manifolds, coinciding with the number of homotopy
classes of maps from the manifold to the classifying space of the underlying
gauge 2-group.
  The operators of our Hamiltonian model are closely related to discrete
2-dimensional holonomy operators for discretised 2-connections on manifolds

2-dimensional holonomy for surfaces embedded in 2-lattices. Several results
concerning the well-definedness of discrete 2-dimensional holonomy, and its

energy storage systems along with the sizing and scheduling of loads present in

frequent switching of loads in the absence of an energy storage system causes
wear and tear and should be avoided. Yet, the amount of solar energy utilized
should be maximized and the problem of finding the optimal static load size of
a finite number of discrete electric loads on the basis of a load response
optimization is considered in this paper. The objective of the optimization is
to maximize solar energy utilization without the need for costly energy storage
systems in an off-grid system. Conceptual and real data for solar photovoltaic
power production is provided the input to the off-grid system. Given the number
of units, the following analytical solutions and computational algorithms are
proposed to compute the optimal load size of each unit: mixed-integer linear
programming and constrained least squares. Based on the available solar power
profile, the algorithms select the optimal on/off switch times and maximize
solar energy utilization by computing the optimal static load sizes. The
effectiveness of the algorithms is compared using one year of solar power data
from San Diego, California and Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that the
annual system solar energy utilization is optimized to 73% when using two loads

deep video saliency network consists of two modules, for capturing the spatial

explicitly incorporating saliency estimates from the static saliency model,
directly produces spatiotemporal saliency inference without time-consuming
optical flow computation. We further propose a novel data augmentation
technique that simulates video training data from existing annotated image
datasets, which enables our network to learn diverse saliency information and
prevents overfitting with the limited number of training videos. Leveraging our
synthetic video data (150K video sequences) and real videos, our deep video

thus producing accurate spatiotemporal saliency estimate. We advance the
state-of-the-art on the DAVIS dataset (MAE of .06) and the FBMS dataset (MAE of

rotor s angle and speed) is essential in monitoring and controlling transient
stability of a power system. It is well known that the covariance matrixes of
process noise (Q) and measurement noise (R) have a significant impact on the
Kalman filter s performance in estimating dynamic states. The conventional
ad-hoc approaches for estimating the covariance matrixes are not adequate in
achieving the best filtering performance. To address this problem, this paper
proposes an adaptive filtering approach to adaptively estimate Q and R based on
innovation and residual to improve the dynamic state estimation accuracy of the
extended Kalman filter (EKF). It is shown through the simulation on the
two-area model that the proposed estimation method is more robust against the
initial errors in Q and R than the conventional method in estimating the
dynamic states of a synchronous machine.

significant number of cases due to dynamical effects. In other cases, the spin
should reflect the natal spin of the primary BH which are currently
theoretically unconstrained. We argue that the three currently published LIGO
systems (GW150914, GW151226, LVT151012) suggest that this spin is small. The
resultant effective spin distribution of gravitational wave sources should thus
be bi-model if this classic GW progenitor channel is indeed dominant. While
this is consistent with the LIGO detections thus far, it is in contrast to the
three best-measured high-mass x-ray binary (HMXB) systems. A comparison of the
spin distribution of HMXBs and GW sources should ultimately reveal whether or
not these systems arise from similar astrophysical channels.

obtained in closed forms, and the optimal transmit power and bandwidth

and the optimal MEC server scheduling decision are derived in closed forms.
Besides, a delay-improved mechanism is proposed to reduce the execution delay.

calculation of the grand partition function in this formulation amounts to a
canonical trace over the eigenfunctions of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian at fixed
total number of bosons $N$, and that the additional trace over $N$ that is
required in the grand-canonical formalism is never carried out. This implies
that what usually passes as the grand-canonical treatment of the Bogoliubov
Hamiltonian is not quite grand-canonical, and is in fact a canonical one. We
also show that the discontinuity in the condensate density predicted by
previous formulations of this theory as the temperature $T$ goes past the
critical transition temperature $T_c$ is a direct consequence of an
inappropriate generalization of the Bogoliubov prescription to finite
temperatures, and that this discontinuity disappears when this prescription is
either used as a zero temperature approximation or avoided altogether. Armed
with the above findings, we reformulate the statistical mechanics of
interacting bosons in the canonical ensemble and derive the thermodynamics of
the system. We then show how the canonical treatment can be used to setup a
truly grand-canonical description of the statistical mechanics of a weakly
interacting Bose gas where the average number of bosons in the system varies
with temperature, unlike existing formulations where the total number of bosons
$N$ is taken to be a constant that does not depend on $T$. Consequences on the

communication enables simultaneous backhaul and access transmissions at small

access and backhaul. However, in such simultaneous operations, all the links
experience higher interference, which significantly suppresses the gains of FD
operations. We propose an interference-aware scheduling method to maximize the
FD gain across multiple UEs in both uplink and downlink directions, while
maintaining a level of fairness between all UEs. It jointly schedules the
appropriate links and traffic based on the back-pressure algorithm, and
allocates appropriate transmission powers to the scheduled links using
Geometric Programming. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheduler
nearly doubles the throughput of small cells compared to traditional

formation dominates. To investigate, we use 70 RQQs from the Spitzer-Herschel
Active Galaxy Survey. These quasars are all at $z$ ~ 1, thereby minimising
evolutionary effects, and have been selected to span a factor of ~100 in
optical luminosity, so that the luminosity dependence of their properties can
be studied. We have imaged the sample using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(JVLA), whose high sensitivity results in 35 RQQs being detected above 2
$\sigma$. This radio dataset is combined with far-infrared luminosities derived
from grey-body fitting to Herschel photometry. By exploiting the
far-infrared--radio correlation observed for star-forming galaxies, and
comparing two independent estimates of the star-formation rate, we show that
star formation alone is not sufficient to explain the total radio emission.
Considering RQQs above a 2-$\sigma$ detection level in both the radio and the
far-infrared, 92 per cent are accretion-dominated, and the accretion process
accounts for 80 per cent of the radio luminosity when summed across the
objects. The radio emission connected with accretion appears to be correlated
with the optical luminosity of the RQQ, whilst a weaker luminosity-dependence
is evident for the radio emission connected with star formation.

supports surface plasmon resonances (SPRs). Moreover, the continuously tunable
conductivity of graphene enables active SPRs and gives rise to a range of
active applications. However, the interaction between graphene and metal-based
resonant metamaterials has not been fully understood. In this work, a
simulation investigation on the interaction between the graphene layer and THz
resonances supported by the two-gap split ring metamaterials is systematically
conducted. The simulation results show that the graphene layer can
substantially reduce the Fano resonance and even switch it off, while leave the
dipole resonance nearly unaffected, which phenomenon is well explained with the
high conductivity of graphene. With the manipulation of graphene conductivity
via altering its Fermi energy or layer number, the amplitude of the Fano
resonance can be modulated. The tunable Fano resonance here together with the
underlying physical mechanism can be strategically important in designing
active metal-graphene hybrid metamaterials. In addition, the ""sensitivity"" to

employed in sensing other graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials or

we propose a novel method for completing a profile. We have developed a two

resolution increases the performance of the system as this has resulted in more
records getting linked to the correct entity. Also, we used trustworthiness of

appropriate values from records to complete a profile based on our proposed
selection criteria. We have used various metrics for measuring the performance
of the resolution phase as well as for the overall ReLiC framework. It is
established through our results that the use of biased sources has
significantly improved the performance of the ReLiC framework. Experimental
results show that our proposed system, ReLiC outperforms the state-of-the-art.

introduce a topological invariant of complexified real line arrangements, the
chamber weight. This invariant is based on the weight counting over the points
of the arrangement dual configuration, located in particular chambers of the
real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, dealing only with geometrical
properties.
  Using this dual point of view, we construct several examples of complexified
real line arrangements with the same combinatorial data and different
embeddings in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (i.e. Zariski pairs), which are distinguished by
this invariant. In particular, we obtain new Zariski pairs of 13, 15 and 17
lines defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and containing only double and triple points.
For each one of them, we can derive degenerations, containing points of
multiplicity 2, 3 and 5, which are also Zariski pairs.
  We explicitly compute the moduli space of the combinatorics of one of these
examples, and prove that it has exactly two connected components. We also
obtain three geometric characterizations of these components: the existence of
two smooth conics, one tangent to six lines and the other containing six triple
points, as well as the collinearity of three specific triple points.

  Correspondence",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a descriptor, called fully convolutional self-similarity (FCSS),
for dense semantic correspondence. To robustly match points among different
instances within the same object class, we formulate FCSS using local
self-similarity (LSS) within a fully convolutional network. In contrast to
existing CNN-based descriptors, FCSS is inherently insensitive to intra-class
appearance variations because of its LSS-based structure, while maintaining the
precise localization ability of deep neural networks. The sampling patterns of
local structure and the self-similarity measure are jointly learned within the
proposed network in an end-to-end and multi-scale manner. As training data for
semantic correspondence is rather limited, we propose to leverage object
candidate priors provided in existing image datasets and also correspondence
consistency between object pairs to enable weakly-supervised learning.
Experiments demonstrate that FCSS outperforms conventional handcrafted
descriptors and CNN-based descriptors on various benchmarks.

constructed by the reduction of a (2,0) six-dimensional theory on a punctured
Riemann surface C (called the UV curve). A basic degeneration limit of the
surface C is when several punctures are brought close to each other. As this
happens, a long tube appears in C and a weakly coupled gauge group emerges.
When the corresponding gauge coupling is turned off, we are left with two
surfaces. This decoupling leads to a unique result. We explain how to fix the
gauge group that becomes weakly coupled and the resulting two theories, in
terms of the types of punctures on the surface C. Each of the resulting
theories is given in terms of a class-S theory (plus possibly additional free
hypermultiplets). Many other more complicated degeneration limits can be
described by repeatedly using this specification.
  For questions about weak coupling limits in such theories, it is useful to
consider the set of punctures that can appear at the end of a tube. These are
the punctures that are created in the resulting surfaces when the gauge
coupling is taken to be extremely weak. Not any puncture can be formed in a
decoupling process, and this set is described. Each such puncture can be found
diagrammatically in terms of the other punctures on C in a particular
decoupling limit. The relation of the gauge group to the symmetry associated
with this puncture is discussed.
  We discuss the relation of such degeneration limits of large N theories,
through the AdS/CFT correspondence, to decoupled field theories on AdS_5.

holes in the $10M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 200M_\odot$ range has recently been
reconsidered, particularly in the light of the detection of gravitational waves
by the LIGO experiment. The existence of even a small fraction of dark matter
in black holes should nevertheless result in noticeable quasar gravitational
microlensing. Quasar microlensing is sensitive to any type of compact objects
in the lens galaxy, to their abundance, and to their mass. We have analyzed
optical and X-ray microlensing data from 24 gravitationally lensed quasars to
estimate the abundance of compact objects in a very wide range of masses. We
conclude that the fraction of mass in black holes or any type of compact
objects is negligible outside of the $0.05 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 0.45
M_\odot$ mass range and that it amounts to $20 \pm5$% of the total matter, in

primordial black holes appears to be inconsistent with current microlensing
observations. Therefore, primordial massive black holes are a very unlikely
source of the gravitational radiation detected by LIGO.

is an approach commonly used in many areas of bioinformatics, including
analysis of gene expression data, mutations, metabolomic profiles and others.
It can be formulated as a recovery of an active module from which an
experimental signal is generated. Commonly, methods for solving this problem
result in a single subnetwork that is considered to be a good candidate.
However, it is usually useful to consider not one but multiple candidate
modules at different significance threshold levels. Therefore, in this paper we
suggest to consider a problem of finding a vertex ranking instead of finding a
single module. We also propose two algorithms for solving this problem: one
that we consider to be optimal but computationally expensive for real-world
networks and one that works close to the optimal in practice and is also able
to work with big networks.

It is demonstrated that correlation effects on Fe-3d states are sufficient in

insufficient for the simultaneous elimination of the hole -- like Fermi surface
around the $\Gamma$-point which is not observed in ARPES experiments. Detailed
comparison of ARPES detected and calculated quasiparticle bands shows
reasonable agreement between theory and experiment. Analysis of the bands with
respect to their origin and orbital composition shows, that for FeSe/STO system
the experimentally observed ""replica"" quasiparticle band at the M-point
(usually attributed to forward scattering interactions with optical phonons in
SrTiO$_3$ substrate) can be reasonably understood just as the LDA calculated
Fe-3d$_{xy}$ band, renormalized by electronic correlations. The only
manifestation of the substrate reduces to lifting the degeneracy between
Fe-3d$_{xz}$ and Fe-3d$_{yz}$ bands in the vicinity of M-point. For the case of

accretion rate in the recently discovered class of pulsating ultraluminous
X-ray sources (ULX). The peak luminosity of SMC X-3 during its major outburst
in 2016-2017 reached ~2.5x10^39 erg/s comparable to that in ULXs thus making
this source the nearest ULX-pulsar. SMC X-3 belongs to the class of transient
X-ray pulsars with Be optical companions, and exhibited a giant outburst in
July 2016 - February 2017. The source has been observed during the entire
outburst with the Swift/XRT and Fermi/GBM telescopes, as well as the NuSTAR
observatory. Collected data allowed us to estimate the magnetic field strength
of the neutron star in SMC X-3 using several independent methods. Spin
evolution of the source during and between the outbursts and the luminosity of
the transition to so-called propeller regime in the range of (0.3 - 7)x10^35
erg/s imply relatively weak dipole field of (1 - 5)x10^12 G. On the other hand,
there is also evidence for much stronger field in the immediate vicinity of the
neutron star surface. In particular, transition from super- to sub-critical
accretion regime associated with cease of the accretion column, absence of
cyclotron absorption features in the broadband X-ray spectrum of the source
obtained with NuSTAR and very high peak luminosity favor an order of magnitude
stronger field. This discrepancy makes SMC X-3 a good candidate to posses
significant non-dipolar components of the field, and an intermediate source
between classical X-ray pulsars and accreting magnetars which may constitute an
appreciable fraction of ULX population.

geometric contexts, such as liquid crystals models and harmonic maps, lead to
consider Sobolev maps, that is, Sobolev vector functions whose range is
constrained in a surface or submanifold of the space. This additional nonlinear

These singularities are characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant

infrastructure of power delivery system, in order to transmit data over power
lines. In PLC networks, different nodes of the network are interconnected via
power delivery transmission lines, and the data signal is flowing between them.
However, the attenuation and the harsh environment of the power line
communication channels, makes it difficult to establish a reliable
communication between two nodes of the network which are separated by a long
distance. Relaying and cooperative communication has been used to overcome this
problem. In this paper a two-hop cooperative PLC has been studied, where the
data is communicated between a transmitter and a receiver node, through a
single array node which has to be selected from a set of available arrays. The
relay selection problem can be solved by having channel state information (CSI)
at transmitter and selecting the relay which results in the best performance.
However, acquiring the channel state information at transmitter increases the
complexity of the communication system and introduces undesired overhead to the
system. We propose a class of machine learning schemes, namely multi-armed
bandit (MAB), to solve the relay selection problem without the knowledge of the
channel at the transmitter. Furthermore, we develop a new MAB algorithm which
exploits the periodicity of the synchronous impulsive noise of the PLC channel,
in order to improve the relay selection algorithm.

Nevertheless, positive probability distributions for measurement outcomes can
be obtained from the KQPD by taking into account the effect of measurement
back-action and imprecision. Negativity in the KQPD can be linked to an
interference effect and acts as an indicator for non-classical behavior.
Notable examples of the KQPD are the Wigner function and the full counting
statistics, both of which have been used extensively to describe systems in the
absence as well as in the presence of a measurement apparatus. Here we discuss
the KQPD and its moments in detail and connect it to various time-dependent

field $\mathbb{F}$, in particular the special case $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_p$.
They are unified by the theme of ""breaking the $3/2$ threshold"", epitomising
the previous state of the art. These estimates stem from specially suited
applications of incidence bounds over $\mathbb{F}$, which apply to higher
moments of representation functions.
  We establish the estimate $|R[A]| \gtrsim |A|^{8/5}$ for cardinality of the
set $R[A]$ of distinct cross-ratios defined by triples of elements of a
(sufficiently small if $\mathbb{F}$ has positive characteristic, similarly for
the rest of the estimates) set $A\subset \mathbb{F}$, pinned at infinity. The
cross-ratio naturally arises in various sum-product type questions of
projective nature and is the unifying concept underlying most of our results.
It enables one to take advantage of its symmetry properties as an onset of
growth of, for instance, products of difference sets. The geometric nature of
the cross-ratio enables us to break the version of the above threshold for the
minimum number of distinct triangle areas $Ouu'$, defined by points $u,u'$ of a
non-collinear point set $P\subset \mathbb{F}^2$.
  Another instance of breaking the threshold is showing that if $A$ is
sufficiently small and has additive doubling constant $M$, then $|AA|\gtrsim
M^{-2}|A|^{14/9}$. This result has a second moment version, which allows for
new upper bounds for the number of collinear point triples in the set $A\times
A\subset \mathbb{F}^2$, the quantity often arising in applications of geometric
incidence estimates.

  data with pileup",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  -Purpose: A neural network estimator to process x-ray spectral measurements
from photon counting detectors with pileup. The estimator is used with an
expansion of the attenuation coefficient as a linear combination of functions
of energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on the material composition at
points within the object [R.E. Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med. Biol., 1976,
733-744]. The estimator computes the line integrals of the coefficients from
measurements with different spectra. Neural network estimators are trained with
measurements of a calibration phantom with the clinical x-ray system. One
estimator uses low noise training data and another network is trained with data
computed by adding random noise to the low noise data. The performance of the
estimators is compared to each other and to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).
Methods: The estimator performance is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation
with an idealized model of a photon counting detector that includes only pileup
and quantum noise. Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration
phantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon
counting detectors with pileup. Detectors with small and large dead times are
considered. Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed
by averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of
exposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or
one projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are
computed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed
by adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are
multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample
covariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the
estimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test
objects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural
network estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the
bias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each
compared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise
data and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup
cases. Networks trained with very low noise data have low bias but large
variance for both pileup cases. ralvarez@aprendtech.com Networks trained with
high noise data have both large bias and large variance. Conclusion: With a
properly chosen level of added training data noise, a neural network estimator
for photon counting data with pileup can have variance close to the CRLB with
negligible bias.

ferromagnetic state in SrRuO$_3$ is believed to be of itinerant type with
transition temperature $T_c$ $\sim$ 162 K. Crystallographically, SrRuO$_3$ has
a distorted orthorhombic structure. Substitution of Ti$^{+4}$ (3$d^0$) for
Ru$^{+4}$ (4$d^4$), however, does not introduce significant structural
modification due to their matching ionic radii. This substitution, on the other
hand, is expected to tune the electronic correlation effect and the $d$
electron density in system. With Ti substitution, we find that magnetic moment
and Curie temperature decreases but $T_c$ remains unchanged which has been
attributed to opposite tuning of electron correlation effect and density of
states within framework of itinerant ferromagnetism. The estimated critical
exponent ($\beta$) related to magnetization implies a mean-field type of
magnetic nature in SrRuO$_3$. The value of $\beta$ further increases with $x$
which is understood from the dilution effect of magnetic lattice. The system
evolves to exhibit Griffiths phase like behavior above $T_c$ which is usually
realized in diluted ferromagnet following local moment model of magnetism. Our

in hexagonal array in the carbon nanotube reinforced polymer matrix (CNRP). We
considered three different cases of CNRP, in which carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are:
(i) aligned along the direction of carbon fiber, (ii) aligned radially to the
axis of carbon fiber, and (iii) randomly dispersed. Accordingly, multiscale
models were developed. First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and then
Mori-Tanaka technique were used to estimate the effective elastic properties of
CNRP. Second, a micromechanical three-phase shear lag model was developed
considering the staggering effect of microscale fibers and the application of
radial loads on the cylindrical representative volume element (RVE) of
nano-reinforced composite. Our results reveal that the stress transfer
characteristics of the nano-reinforced composite are significantly improved by
controlling the CNT morphology, particularly, when they are randomly dispersed
around the microscale fiber. The results from the developed shear lag model

accurately capturing the viscous boundary layer at modest computational cost.
The incompressible Navier--Stokes equations are solved with a fractional-step
scheme which is second-order-accurate in space and time, while the fluid--solid

sub-iterations to increase stability for light, rigid bodies. Through a series
of benchmark studies we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this
approach compared to other boundary conformal and static grid methods in the

particle surfaces is crucial to obtain accurate solutions to many common test

(post-AGB) stars interspersed in the old stellar populations, but by in situ
star formation; this is vindicated by the line-ratio diagnostic of the extended
emission. We propose that both the ring and large-scale H{\alpha}-emitting gas
are created by the tidal accretion in a collision-and then merger-with a
gas-rich galaxy of a comparable mass.

inventory is modelled by a diffusion process and a long-term average cost
criterion is used to make decisions. The class of such models under
consideration have general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points
that are consistent with the notion that demand should tend to reduce the
inventory level. The conditions on the cost functions are greatly relaxed from
those in \cite{helm:15b}. Characterization of the cost of a general $(s,S)$
policy as a function of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear
optimization problem over the ordering levels $s$ and $S$. Existence of an
optimizing pair $(s_*,S_*)$ is established for these models under very weak
conditions; non-existence of an optimizing pair is also discussed. Using
average expected occupation and ordering measures and weak convergence
arguments, weak conditions are given for the optimality of the $(s_*,S_*)$
ordering policy in the general class of admissible policies. The analysis
involves an auxiliary function that is globally $C^2$ and which, together with
the infimal cost, solve a particular system of linear equations and
inequalities related to but different from the long-term average
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This approach provides an analytical solution
to the problem rather than a solution involving intricate analysis of the
stochastic processes. The range of applicability of these results is
illustrated on a drifted Brownian motion inventory model, both unconstrained
and reflected, and on a geometric Brownian motion inventory model under three
different cost structures.

long-term average cost criterion using weak convergence methods applied to
average expected occupation and average expected ordering measures. Under the
natural condition of inf-compactness of the holding cost rate function, the
average expected occupation measures are seen to be tight and hence have weak
limits. However inf-compactness is not a natural assumption to impose on the
ordering cost function. For example, the cost function composed of a fixed cost
plus proportional (to the size of the order) cost is not inf-compact.
Intuitively, it would seem that imposing a requirement that the long-term
average cost be finite ought to imply tightness of the average expected
ordering measures; a lack of tightness should mean that the inventory process
spends large amounts of time in regions that have arbitrarily large holding
costs resulting in an infinite long-term average cost. This paper demonstrates
that this intuition is incorrect by identifying a model and an ordering policy
for which the resulting inventory process has a finite long-term average cost,
tightness of the average expected occupation measures but which lacks tightness
of the average expected ordering measures.

socio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A
wellbeing-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human
population dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic
states of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex
dynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple
equations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify
preconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and
planet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a
global collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider scenarios
corresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The
necessity of accounting for the ""human factor"" in Earth system models is
highlighted by the fact that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved
opposing to what would ""naturally"" be expected on a planet without humans. The
intensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human
well-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a
biomass-only scenario. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that
trajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be
almost indistinguishable during a very long transient phase. Given current
population levels, our study also supports the claim that besides reducing the
global demand for energy, only the extensive use of renewable energies may pave
the way into a sustainable future.

investigated through the decay of the fields which are coupled to the udd
inflaton, a gauge invariant combination of squarks. After the end of inflation,
the flat direction oscillates about the minimum of its potential, losing at
each oscillation about 56% of its energy into bursts of gauge/gaugino and
scalar quanta when crossing the origin. These particles then acquire a large
inflaton VEV-induced mass and decay perturbatively into the MSSM quanta and
gravitinos, transferring the inflaton energy very efficiently via instant
preheating. Regarding thermalization, we show that the MSSM degrees of freedom
thermalize very quickly, yet not immediately by virtue of the large vacuum
expectation value of the inflaton, which breaks the $SU(3)_C\times U(1)_Y$
symmetry into a residual $U(1)$. The energy transfer to the MSSM quanta is very
efficient, since full thermalization is achieved after only $\mathcal{O}(40)$
complete oscillations. The udd inflaton thus provides an extremely efficient
reheating of the Universe, with a temperature
$T_{reh}=\mathcal{O}(10^8\mathrm{GeV})$ that allows for instance several
mechanisms of baryogenesis. We also compute the gravitino number density from
the perturbative decay of the flat direction and of the SUSY multiplet. We find

over the degrees of freedom of the light field, the system can be well
described by an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which contains the light-mediated
dipole-dipole interaction between atoms. This long-range interaction is at the
origin of the various collective effects, or of collective excitation modes of
the system. Even though an analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
these collective modes does allow distinguishing superradiant modes, for
instance, from other collective modes, this is not sufficient to understand the
dynamics of a driven system, as not all collective modes are significantly
populated. Here, we study how the excitation parameters, i.e. the driving
field, determines the population of the collective modes. We investigate in
particular the role of the laser detuning from the atomic transition, and
demonstrate a simple relation between the detuning and the steady-state
population of the modes. This relation allows understanding several properties

independent of the detuning at large enough detuning without vanishing, and why
superradiance, but not subradiance, is suppressed near resonance.

matrices and coherent projectors of rank n are introduced, and their properties
(e.g., the resolution of the identity) are dis- cussed. Cooperative game theory
and in particular the Shapley methodology, is used to renormalize coherent
states, into a particular type of coherent density matrices (dressed coherent
states). The Q-function of a Hermitian operator, is then renormalized into a
physical analogue of the Shapley values. Both the Q-function and the Shapley
values, are used to study the relocation of a Hamilto- nian in phase space as
the coupling constant varies, and its effect on the ground state of the system.
The formalism is also generalized for any total set of states, for which we
have no resolution of the identity. The dressing formalism leads to density
matrices that resolve the identity, and makes them practically useful.

  We propose the first online approach to source localization: We deploy a

Strongly magnetic early-B type chemically peculiar stars in an advanced
evolutionary state are of special interest to understand the evolution of the
angular momentum and spin-down timescales in the presence of a global magnetic
field. We exploited 17 FORS2 low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations
and 844 ASAS3 photometric measurements for the determination of the rotation
period, pulsations, and the magnetic field geometry of the star. We calculated
periodograms and applied phenomenological models of photometric, spectral and
spectropolarimetric variability. We found that all quantities studied,
specifically equivalent widths, the mean longitudinal magnetic field <B_z>, and
the flux in the V filter, vary with the same period P = 2.628d, which was
identified as the rotation period. The observed variations can be fully
explained by a rigidly rotating main-sequence star with an uneven distribution
of chemical elements, photometric spots, and a stable, nearly dipolar magnetic
field with a polar field strength of about 21kG, frozen into the body of the
star. The magnetic field of CPD -62 2124 is tilted to the rotation axis by
beta=28+-7deg, while the inclination of the rotation axis towards the line of
sight is only i=20+-5deg. In the acquired FORS2 spectra, we detect short-term

spatial correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations. For confined
systems, this is known to lead to remarkable equilibrium physical phenomena,
including finite-size effects and critical Casimir forces. We explore here some
non-equilibrium aspects of these effects in the stationary state resulting from
the action of external forces: by analyzing a model of a correlated fluid under
shear, spatially confined by two parallel plates, we study the resulting
viscosity within the setting of (Gaussian) Landau-Ginzburg theory.
Specifically, we introduce a model in which the hydrodynamic velocity field
(obeying the Stokes equation) is coupled to an order parameter with dissipative
dynamics. The well-known Green-Kubo relation for bulk systems is generalized
for confined systems. This is shown to result in a non-local Stokes equation
for the fluid flow, due to the correlated fluctuations. The resulting effective
shear viscosity shows universal as well as non-universal contributions, which
we study in detail. In particular, the deviation from the bulk behavior is
universal, depending on the ratio of the correlation length and the film
thickness $L$. In addition, at the critical point the viscosity is proportional
to $\ell/L$, where $\ell$ is a dynamic length scale. These findings are
expected to be experimentally observable, especially for systems where the bulk
viscosity is affected by critical fluctuations.

reflections for many of the multilayers having sufficiently large thickness (at

than the nominal values.The observed GMR was found to be dominated by the
multilayer-like ferromagnetic (FM) contribution even for multilayers without
visible superlattice satellites. There was always also a modest
superparamagnetic (SPM) contribution to the GMR and this term was the largest
for multilayers with very thin (0.5 nm) magnetic layers containg apparently a
small amount of magnetically decoupled SPM regions. No oscillatory GMR behavior
with spacer thickness was observed at any magnetic layer thickness. The
saturation of the coercivity as measured by the peak position of the MR(H)
curves indicated a complete decoupling of magnetic layers for large spacer
thicknesses. The GMR increased with total multilayer thickness which could be
ascribed to an increasing SPM contribution to the GMR due to an increasing
surface roughness, also indicated by the increasing coercivity. For multilayers
with Cu layers deposited at more and more positive potentials, the GMRFM term
increased and the GMRSPM term decreased. At the same time, a corresponding
reduction of surface roughness measured with atomic force microscopy indicated
an improvement of the multilayer structural quality which was, however, not
accompanied by an increase of the superlattice reflection intensities.

similar energy form, PDE(s) but with different boundary conditions, which may

functional for electrolyte solution within a finite domain with either physical

components (electrostatic potential energy, ideal gas entropy term and chemical
potential term), new boundary interaction terms are added for both Neumann and

PNP equations for non-equilibrium case, under different boundary conditions.

spin flip transitions as they radiate, preferentially spin polarizing in one
direction -- the Sokolov-Ternov effect. Here we show that this effect could
occur very rapidly (in less than 10 fs) in high intensity ($I\gtrsim10^{23}$
W/cm$^{2}$) laser-matter interactions, resulting in a high degree of electron
spin polarization (70%-90%).

graphs, as an artifact of the locally treelike approximation. For an arbitrary
finite, connected, undirected graph we construct an infinite tree having the
same local structural properties as this finite graph, when observed by a
nonbacktracking walker. Formally excluding the boundary, this infinite tree is
a generalization of the Bethe lattice. We indicate an infinite, locally
treelike, random network whose local structure is exactly given by this
infinite tree. Message passing equations for various cooperative models on this
construction are the same as for the original finite graph, but here they
provide the exact solutions of the corresponding cooperative problems. These
solutions are good approximations to observables for the models on the original
graph when it is sufficiently large and not strongly correlated. We show how to
express these solutions in the critical region in terms of the principal
eigenvector components of the nonbacktracking matrix. As representative
examples we formulate the problems of the random and optimal destruction of a
connected graph in terms of our construction, the nonbacktracking expansion. We
analyze the limitations and the accuracy of the message passing algorithms for
different classes of networks and compare the complexity of the message passing
calculations to that of direct numerical simulations. Notably, in a range of
important cases, simulations turn out to be more efficient computationally than
the message passing.

database to describe fluid properties and applies to pure gases and mixtures in
both subcritical and supercritical regimes. The limitations of the model and
the issues encountered with its implementation are discussed. The adsorption
isotherms of CH4 / CO2 mixture are modeled and parameterized as implementation
examples.

direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is devised in this letter. Instead of
the widely used least squares criterion that is only optimal for Gaussian noise
environment, we adopt the least absolute deviation criterion to enhance the
robustness against outliers. Considering both intensity- and amplitude-based
observation models, the framework of ADMM is developed to solve the resulting
non-differentiable optimization problems. It is demonstrated that the core
subproblem of ADMM is the proximity operator of the L1-norm, which can be
computed efficiently by soft-thresholding in each iteration. Simulation results
are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach
compared to the existing schemes.
