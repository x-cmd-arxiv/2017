scientists investigating the elementary properties of matter. The need to study
cosmic rays, with energies thousands of times larger than those encountered in
particle accelerators, led to the development of modern detection hardware and
experimental methodologies. We present a low power, low complexity data
acquisition (DAQ) system with 100 ps resolution, suitable for particle and
radiation detection experiments. The system uses a Multiple-Time-over-Threshold
(MToT) technique for the treatment of the output signal of Photo Multiplier
Tubes (PMTs). The use of three thresholds compensates for the slewing effects
and offers a more accurate measurement of the PMT pulses' width. For the
evaluation of the pulse the system uses comparators and a Time-to-Digital (TDC)
converter, whereas the pulses are time-stamped using the GPS signal. The
prototype card is analyzed for its noise behavior and is tested to verify its
performance. The system has been designed for the HEllenic LYceum Cosmic
Observatories Network (HELYCON) Extensive Air Showers (EAS) detector.

order $d$ is continuous from the Triebel--Lizorkin space $F^d_{p,1}$ to $L_p$,
$1\le p<\infty$, and that this is optimal within the Besov and
Triebel--Lizorkin scales.The proof also leads to the known continuity for
$s>d$, while for all real $s$ the sufficiency of H\""ormander's condition on the
twisted diagonal is carried over to the Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin framework.
To obtain this, type 1,1-operators are extended to distributions with compact
spectrum, and Fourier transformed operators of this type are on such
distributions proved to satisfy a support rule, generalising the rule for
convolutions. Thereby the use of reduced symbols, as introduced by Coifman and
Meyer, is replaced by direct application of the paradifferential methods. A few
flaws in the literature have been detected and corrected.

decays in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$~GeV. The $e^+e^-$ pair
yield from $b\bar{b}$ and $c\bar{c}$ is separated by exploiting a double
differential fit done simultaneously in dielectron invariant mass and $p_T$. We
used three different event generators, {\sc pythia}, {\sc mc@nlo}, and {\sc
powheg}, to simulate the $e^+e^-$ spectra from $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$
production. The data can be well described by all three generators within the
detector acceptance. However, when using the generators to extrapolate to
$4\pi$, significant differences are observed for the total cross section. These
difference are less pronounced for $b\bar{b}$ than for $c\bar{c}$. The same
model dependence was observed in already published $d$+$A$ data. The $p$+$p$
data are also directly compared with $d$+$A$ data in mass and $p_T$, and within
the statistical accuracy no nuclear modification is seen.

systems and mixed-membership topic models can go beyond keyword search to
inform resource discovery, hypothesis formulation, and argument extraction for
interdisciplinary research. Our test domain is the history and philosophy of
scientific work on animal mind and cognition. The methods can be generalized to
other research areas and ultimately support a system for semi-automatic
identification of argument structures. We provide a case study for the
application of the methods to the problem of identifying and extracting
arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of
comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and
mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform
resource discovery in this domain. Through a novel approach of ""drill-down""
topic modeling---simultaneously reducing both the size of the corpus and the
unit of analysis---we are able to reduce a large collection of fulltext volumes
to a much smaller set of pages within six focal volumes containing arguments of
interest to historians and philosophers of comparative psychology. The volumes
identified in this way did not appear among the first ten results of the
keyword search in the HathiTrust digital library and the pages bear the kind of
""close reading"" needed to generate original interpretations that is the heart
of scholarly work in the humanities. Zooming back out, we provide a way to
place the books onto a map of science originally constructed from very
different data and for different purposes. The multilevel approach advances
understanding of the intellectual and societal contexts in which writings are
interpreted.

particle may grow larger or smaller, and divide into smaller ones as time
proceeds. Unlike previous studies, which have focused mainly on the
self-similar case, we introduce a new type of growth-fragmentation which is
closely related to L\'evy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes. Our model
can be viewed as a generalization of compensated fragmentation processes
introduced by Bertoin, or the stochastic counterpart of a family of
growth-fragmentation equations. We establish a convergence criterion for a
sequence of such growth-fragmentations. We also prove that, under certain
conditions, this system fulfills a law of large numbers.

matrices is particularly important in the field of compressed sensing (CS) with
corruptions. If a matrix still satisfies the RIP after that a certain portion
of rows are erased, then we say that this matrix has the strong restricted
isometry property (SRIP). In the field of compressed sensing, random matrices
which satisfy certain moment conditions are of particular interest. Among these
matrices, those with entries generated from i.i.d. Gaussian or symmetric
Bernoulli random variables are often typically considered. Recent studies have
shown that matrices with entries generated from i.i.d. Gaussian random
variables satisfy the SRIP under arbitrary erasure of rows with high
probability. In this paper, we study the erasure robustness property of
Bernoulli random matrices. Our main result shows that with overwhelming
probability, the SRIP holds for Bernoulli random matrices. Moreover, our
analysis leads to a robust version of the famous Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma
for Bernoulli random matrices.

investigated in the last three decades due to its important role in the
mechanics and physics of solids. In this investigation, this problem is
revisited in view of the recent progresses on the phase field approach to
brittle fracture. In this concern, a novel formulation combining the phase
field approach for modeling brittle fracture in the bulk and a cohesive zone
model for pre-existing adhesive interfaces is herein proposed to investigate
the competition between crack penetration and deflection at an interface. The
model, implemented within the finite element method framework using a
monolithic fully implicit solution strategy, is applied to provide a further
insight into the understanding of the role of model parameters on the above
competition. In particular, in this study, the role of the fracture toughness
ratio between the interface and the adjoining bulks and the characteristic
fracture-length scales of the dissipative models are analyzed. In the case of a
brittle interface, the asymptotic predictions based on linear elastic fracture
mechanics criteria for crack penetration, single deflection or double
deflection are fully captured by the present method. Moreover, by increasing
the size of the process zone along the interface, or by varying the internal
length scale of the phase field model, new complex phenomena are emerging, such
as simultaneous crack penetration and deflection and the transition from single
crack penetration to deflection and penetration with subsequent branching into
the bulk.

collisions that is proportional to the rate of entropy production. We find that
the particle production depends only on the power of the centre-of-mass
collision energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ and the effective phase-space/volume (e.g.
geometry of the collision approximated by the number of nucleons participating
in the collision $N_{\rm part}$). We show that at low-energies the
pseudo-rapidity density of particles per participating nucleon pair scales
linearly with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ while at high-energies with $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}^{1/3}$. The $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}^{1/3}$ region is directly related to
sub-nucleon degrees of freedom and creation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This
picture explains experimental observation that the shape of the distributions
of pseudorapidity-density per nucleon pair of charged particles does not depend
on $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ over a large span of collision energies. We provide an
explanation of the scaling and connect it with the maximum rate per unit time
of entropy production. We conclude with remarks on the hadron-parton phase
transition. In particular, our considerations suggest that the pseudo-rapitidy
density of the produced particles per $N_{\rm part}/2$ larger than
approximately 1 (excluding particles from jet fragmentation) is a signature of
a QGP formation.

are modest and close to normally distributed at the separatrix but become
increasingly larger and intermittent towards the main chamber wall. The
frequency power spectra are nevertheless similar for all radial positions and
line-averaged densities. Predictions of a stochastic model, describing the

in excellent agreement with the measurements. This implies that the pulse
duration is the same, while the degree of pulse overlap decreases radially

flows are expected to be collisionless, yet are commonly modeled as a fluid
using ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). Dissipative
effects such as heat conduction and viscosity can be important in a
collisionless plasma and will potentially alter the dynamics and radiative
properties of the flow from that in ideal fluid models; we refer to models that
include these processes as Extended GRMHD. Here we describe a new conservative
code, grim, that enables all the above and additional physics to be efficiently
incorporated. grim combines time evolution and primitive variable inversion
needed for conservative schemes into a single step using an algorithm that only
requires the residuals of the governing equations as inputs. This algorithm
enables the code to be physics agnostic as well as flexibility regarding
time-stepping schemes. grim runs on CPUs, as well as on GPUs, using the same
code. We formulate a performance model, and use it to show that our
implementation runs optimally on both architectures. grim correctly captures
classical GRMHD test problems as well as a new suite of linear and nonlinear
test problems with anisotropic conduction and viscosity in special and general
relativity. As tests and example applications, we resolve the shock
substructure due to the presence of dissipation, and report on relativistic
versions of the magneto-thermal instability and heat flux driven buoyancy
instability, which arise due to anisotropic heat conduction, and of the
firehose instability, which occurs due to anisotropic pressure (i.e.
viscosity). Finally, we show an example integration of an accretion flow around

distributions of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse
momentum hadron trigger, in central and peripheral Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Charged jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT
algorithm for jet radii R between 0.2 and 0.5 and with low infrared cutoff of
track constituents ($p_T>0.2$ GeV/c). A novel mixed-event technique is used to
correct the large uncorrelated background present in heavy ion collisions.
Corrected recoil jet distributions are reported at mid-rapidity, for
charged-jet transverse momentum $p_T^\mathrm{jet,ch}<30$ GeV/c. Comparison is
made to similar measurements for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76
TeV, to calculations for p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV based on the
PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator and on a Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD
approach, and to theoretical calculations incorporating jet quenching. The
recoil jet yield is suppressed in central relative to peripheral collisions,
with the magnitude of the suppression corresponding to medium-induced charged
energy transport out of the jet cone of
$2.8\pm0.2\mathrm{(stat)}\pm1.5\mathrm{(sys)}$ GeV/c, for
$10<p_T^\mathrm{jet,ch}<20$ GeV/c and R = 0.5. No medium-induced change in jet
shape is observed for $R<0.5$. The azimuthal distribution of
low-$p_T^\mathrm{jet,ch}$ recoil jets may be enhanced at large azimuthal angles
to the trigger axis, due to scattering off quasi-particles in the hot QCD
medium. Measurement of this distribution gives a 90% statistical confidence
upper limit to the yield enhancement at large deflection angles in central
Au+Au collisions of $50\pm30\mathrm{(sys)\%}$ of the large-angle yield in
p+pcollisions predicted by PYTHIA.

composition, and kinematic properties. Intermediate-age and old open clusters
are less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar
Galactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction
inside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)
observed by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target
for calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and
chemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements
from $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence
dwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as
cluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a
median radial velocity of $13.6\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster
members have a median radial velocity of $12.0\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median
[Fe/H] of $0.10\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster
members suggests an age of $0.9\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and
$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC
6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about
IOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs
previously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and
Berkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.
These elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of
cluster turn-off mass. The $\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements
are also explored in a self-consistent way.

discriminating among a finite number of affine models with uncontrolled inputs
and noise. Each affine model represents a different system operating mode,
corresponding to unobserved intents of other drivers or robots, or to fault
types or attack strategies, etc. The input design problem aims to find optimal
separating/discriminating (controlled) inputs such that the output trajectories
of all the affine models are guaranteed to be distinguishable from each other,
despite uncertainty in the initial condition and uncontrolled inputs as well as
the presence of process and measurement noise. We propose a novel formulation
to solve this problem, with an emphasis on guarantees for model discrimination
and optimality, in contrast to a previously proposed conservative formulation
using robust optimization. This new formulation can be recast as a bilevel
optimization problem and further reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program
(MILP). Moreover, our fairly general problem setting allows the incorporation
of objectives and/or responsibilities among rational agents. For instance, each
driver has to obey traffic rules, while simultaneously optimizing for safety,
comfort and energy efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for identifying the intention of other vehicles in several driving
scenarios.

feasible, we perform simulations at imaginary strangeness chemical potentials.
We systematically study the effect of different hadronic spectra on

We show that, for each hadronic sector, the well established states are not
enough in order to have agreement with the lattice results. Additional states,
either listed in the Particle Data Group booklet (PDG) but not well
established, or predicted by the Quark Model (QM), are necessary in order to
reproduce the lattice data. For mesons, it appears that the PDG and the quark

the revised TRGB calibration based on two distance anchors (NGC 4258 and the

an online discussion, we find that both negative mood and seeing troll posts by
others significantly increases the probability of a user trolling, and together
double this probability. To support and extend these results, we study how
these same mechanisms play out in the wild via a data-driven, longitudinal
analysis of a large online news discussion community. This analysis reveals
temporal mood effects, and explores long range patterns of repeated exposure to

permitting to derive the abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) for O^2+, as well

dependence of the ADF for the low-metallicity objects, but more uncertain for
high-metallicity objects. We compare nebular and B-type stellar abundances and
we find that the stellar abundances agree better with the nebular ones derived
from collisionally excited lines (CELs). Comparing these results with other

nebular ones derived from CELs in low-metallicity environments and from RLs in
high-metallicity environments. The C/H, O/H and C/O ratios show almost flat

conformity in the local universe. We measure the quenched fraction of neighbor
galaxies around isolated primary galaxies, dividing the isolated sample into
star-forming and quiescent objects. We restrict our measurements to scales $>1$
Mpc to probe the correlations between the formation histories of distinct
halos. Over the stellar mass range $10^{9.7} \le M_\ast/M_\odot \le 10^{10.9}$,
we find minimal statistical evidence for conformity. We further compare these
data to predictions of the halo age-matching model, in which the oldest
galaxies are associated with the oldest halos at fixed $M_\ast$. For models
with strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is
too large to be consistent with the data. For weaker implementations of
age-matching, galactic conformity is not a sensitive diagnostic of halo
assembly bias, and would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data. We
reproduce the results of Kauffmann et al 2013, in which the star formation
rates of neighbor galaxies are significantly reduced around primary galaxies
when the primaries are themselves low star formers. However, we find this
result is mainly driven by contamination in the isolation criterion, when using
our group catalog to remove the small fraction of satellite galaxies in the
sample, the conformity signal largely goes away. Lastly, we show that small
conformity signals, i.e., 2-5% differences in the quenched fractions of
neighbor galaxies, can be produced by mechanisms other than halo assembly bias.
For example, if passive galaxies occupy more massive halos than star forming
galaxies of the same stellar mass, a conformity signal that is consistent with
recent measurements from PRIMUS (Berti et al 2016) can be produced.

exoplanet laboratories to directly measure Q', the modified tidal quality

Previous analysis predicted a rapid orbital decay of the planet toward its host
star that should be measurable on the time scale of a few years, if the star is
as dissipative as is inferred from the circularization of close-in solar-type
binary stars. We have compiled published transit and secondary eclipse timing
(as observed by WASP, TRAPPIST, and Spitzer) with more recent unpublished light
curves (as observed by TRAPPIST and HST) with coverage spanning nine years. We

measured by Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. in the Galactic center (GC) region and the
Galactic ridge (GR). In the first part we perform a data-driven analysis based
on PASS8 Fermi-LAT data: we extend down to few GeV the spectra measured by
H.E.S.S. and infer the primary cosmic-ray (CR) radial distribution between 0.1
and 3 TeV. In the second part we adopt a CR transport model based on a
position-dependent diffusion coefficient. Such behavior reproduces the radial
dependence of the CR spectral index recently inferred from the Fermi-LAT
observations. We find that the bulk of the GR emission can be naturally
explained by the interaction of the diffuse steady-state Galactic CR sea with
the gas present in the Central Molecular Zone. Although our results leave room
for a residual radial-dependent emission associated with a central source, the
relevance of the large-scale background prevents from a solid evidence of a GC
Pevatron.

pattern network (STPN) for energy/power prediction for complex dynamical
systems. Built on symbolic dynamic filtering, the STPN framework is used to
capture not only the individual system characteristics but also the pair-wise
causal dependencies among different sub-systems. For quantifying the causal
dependency, a mutual information based metric is presented. An energy
prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. For
validating the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving
wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind
Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) for identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other,
residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the
Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring the temporal features.
In the energy disaggregation context, convex programming techniques beyond the
STPN framework are developed and applied to achieve improved disaggregation
performance.

Experts are asked to perform a series of binary comparisons and then, using
mathematical methods, the final ranking is prepared. As experts conduct the
individual assessments, they may not always be consistent. The level of
inconsistency among individual assessments is widely accepted as a measure of
the ranking quality. The higher the ranking quality, the greater its
credibility. One way to determine the level of inconsistency among the paired
comparisons is to calculate the value of the inconsistency index. One of the
earliest and most widespread inconsistency indexes is the consistency
coefficient defined by Kendall and Babington Smith. In their work, the authors
consider binary pairwise comparisons, i.e., those where the result of an
individual comparison can only be: better or worse. The presented work extends
the Kendall and Babington Smith index to sets of paired comparisons with ties.
Hence, this extension allows the decision makers to determine the inconsistency
for sets of paired comparisons, where the result may also be ""equal."" The
article contains a definition and analysis of the most inconsistent set of
pairwise comparisons with and without ties. It is also shown that the most
inconsistent set of pairwise comparisons with ties represents a special case of
the more general set cover problem.

preserving important characteristics of the input graph. In this work we study
Vertex Sparsifiers, i.e., sparsifiers whose goal is to reduce the number of
vertices. We focus on the following notions:
  (1) Given a digraph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K \subset V$ with $|K| =
k$, a (vertex) reachability sparsifier of $G$ is a digraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$, $K
\subset V_H$ that preserves all reachability information among terminal pairs.
In this work we introduce the notion of reachability-preserving minors (RPMs) ,
i.e., we require $H$ to be a minor of $G$. We show any directed graph $G$
admits a RPM $H$ of size $O(k^3)$, and if $G$ is planar, then the size of $H$
improves to $O(k^{2} \log k)$. We complement our upper-bound by showing that
there exists an infinite family of grids such that any RPM must have
$\Omega(k^{2})$ vertices.
  (2) Given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K$
with $|K|=k$, an exact (vertex) cut sparsifier of $G$ is a graph $H$ with $K
\subset V_H$ that preserves the value of minimum-cuts separating any
bipartition of $K$. We show that planar graphs with all the $k$ terminals lying
on the same face admit exact cut sparsifiers of size $O(k^{2})$ that are also
planar. Our result extends to flow and distance sparsifiers. It improves the
previous best-known bound of $O(k^22^{2k})$ for cut and flow sparsifiers by an
exponential factor, and matches an $\Omega(k^2)$ lower-bound for this class of
graphs.

changes through its long history, with potentially significant ramifications
for the emergence and long-term stability of atmospheric biosignatures. Though
a great deal of work has centered on refining our understanding of false
positives for remote life detection, much less attention has been paid to the
possibility of false negatives, that is, cryptical biospheres that are
widespread and active on a planet's surface but are ultimately undetectable or
difficult to detect in the composition of a planet's atmosphere. Here, we
summarize recent developments from geochemical proxy records and Earth system
models that provide insight into the long-term evolution of the most readily
detectable potential biosignature gases on Earth - oxygen (O2), ozone (O3), and
methane (CH4). We suggest that the canonical O2-CH4 disequilibrium biosignature
would perhaps have been challenging to detect remotely during Earth's ~4.5
billion year history and that in general atmospheric O2/O3 levels have been a
poor proxy for the presence of Earth's biosphere for all but the last ~500
million years. We further suggest that detecting atmospheric CH4 would have
been problematic for most of the last ~2.5 billion years of Earth's history.
More broadly, we stress that internal oceanic recycling of biosignature gases
will often render surface biospheres on ocean-bearing silicate worlds cryptic,
with the implication that the planets most conducive to the development and
maintenance of a pervasive biosphere will often be challenging to characterize
via conventional atmospheric biosignatures.

purpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining
molecular gas masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy
distributions, and ~1mm dust photometry, in a large sample of 1444 star forming
galaxies (SFGs) between z=0 and 4. The sample covers the stellar mass range
log(M*/M_solar)=9.0-11.8, and star formation rates relative to that on the MS,
delta_MS=SFR/SFR(MS), from 10^{-1.3} to 10^{2.2}. Our most important finding is
that all data sets, despite the different techniques and analysis methods used,
follow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method zero point offsets are
minimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas
depletion time t_depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to star
formation rate, scales as (1+z)^{-0.6}x(delta_MS)^{-0.44}, and is only weakly
dependent on stellar mass. The ratio of molecular-to-stellar mass mu_gas
depends on (1+z)^{2.5}x (delta_MS)^{0.52}x(M*)^{-0.36}, which tracks the
evolution of the specific star formation rate. The redshift dependence of
mu_gas requires a curvature term, as may the mass-dependences of t_depl and
mu_gas. We find no or only weak correlations of t_depl and mu_gas with optical
size R or surface density once one removes the above scalings, but we caution
that optical sizes may not be appropriate for the high gas and dust columns at
high-z.

urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can
estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.
  In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting
when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior
estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior.
Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In
order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active
regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to
evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via
experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our
approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and
other heuristics for posterior estimation.

resulted in novel functionalities, such as cloaking, field rotations, and

tool, has proven to be a versatile approach to achieve such unusual outcomes
relying on materials with highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous properties. Most
applications and designs thus far have been limited to functionalities within a
single physical domain. Here we present transformation optics applied to
thermoelectric phenomena, where thermal and electric flows are coupled via the
Seebeck coefficient and Joule heating is taken into account. Using laminates,
we describe a theoretical thermoelectric cloak capable of hiding objects from
thermoelectric flow. Our calculations show that such a cloak does not depend on
the particular boundary conditions and can also operate in different single

Their seismic properties and surface rotation are well constrained from
previous studies. About 53 hours of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained
to derive fundamental parameters and A(Li). These values were combined and
confronted with seismic masses, radii and ages, as well as surface rotation
periods. We identify a total of 6 binary systems. A well-defined relation
between A(Li) and rotation was obtained. With models constrained by the
characterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we
identify a sequence of three SA with similar mass (~1.1Mo) and stellar ages
ranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of ~7% for the mass
uncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the
predicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the
Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal
mixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We present A(Li) for
a consistent spectroscopic survey of SA with a mass of 1.00+/-0.15Mo, and
characterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on
Kepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and P_rot supports the
gyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun. The consensus between
measured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated onto the Sun's

on the fundamental physics of relativistic jet formation. Since quasars have
high values of $L_{\rm{bol}}$ by definition, only $\sim 10$ kinetically
dominated quasars (with $\overline{Q}/L_{\rm{bol}}>1$) have been found, where
$\overline{Q}$ is the long term time averaged jet power. We use low frequency
(151 MHz$-$1.66 GHz) observations of the quasar 3C\,418 to determine
$\overline{Q}\approx 5.5 \pm 1.3 \times 10^{46} \rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. Analysis of

inefficient, though they are energetically efficient when the energy output in
winds and jets is also counted. The simulated models reproduce the main
empirical types of spectra --- disk-like, supersoft, soft, hard --- observed in
ULXs. The magnetic field configuration, whether MAD (""magnetically arrested

shown to be robust against the noise and, surprisingly, to attain better rates
of convergence than their precursors, method of moment estimators, even in the
absence of microstructure noise. Our main results give approximate optimal

the data volume and reduce computational burden. Existing studies focus on
approximating the ordinary least squares estimate in linear regression, where
statistical leverage scores are often used to define subsampling probabilities.
In this paper, we propose fast subsampling algorithms to efficiently
approximate the maximum likelihood estimate in logistic regression. We first
establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator from a general
subsampling algorithm, and then derive optimal subsampling probabilities that
minimize the asymptotic mean squared error of the resultant estimator. An
alternative minimization criterion is also proposed to further reduce the
computational cost. The optimal subsampling probabilities depend on the full
data estimate, so we develop a two-step algorithm to approximate the optimal
subsampling procedure. This algorithm is computationally efficient and has a
significant reduction in computing time compared to the full data approach.
Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator from a two-step algorithm
are also established. Synthetic and real data sets are used to evaluate the
practical performance of the proposed method.

throughout the world. In identification (as opposed to verification) mode, an
iris to be recognized is typically matched against all N enrolled irises. This
is the classic ""1-to-N search"". In order to improve the speed of large-scale
identification, a modified ""1-to-First"" search has been used in some
operational systems. A 1-to-First search terminates with the first
below-threshold match that is found, whereas a 1-to-N search always finds the
best match across all enrollments. We know of no previous studies that evaluate
how the accuracy of 1-to-First search differs from that of 1-to-N search. Using
a dataset of over 50,000 iris images from 2,800 different irises, we perform
experiments to evaluate the relative accuracy of 1-to-First and 1-to-N search.
We evaluate how the accuracy difference changes with larger numbers of enrolled
irises, and with larger ranges of rotational difference allowed between iris
images. We find that False Match error rate for 1-to-First is higher than for
1-to-N, and the the difference grows with larger number of enrolled irises and
with larger range of rotation.

combining natural language processing, program synthesis, and automated program
repair. Given the user's English description, our technique first uses semantic
parsing to generate a query sketch, which is subsequently completed using
type-directed program synthesis and assigned a confidence score using database
contents. However, since the user's description may not accurately reflect the
actual database schema, our approach also performs fault localization and
repairs the erroneous part of the sketch. This synthesize-repair loop is
repeated until the algorithm infers a query with a sufficiently high confidence

evaluate it on three different databases. Our experiments show that the desired
query is ranked within the top 5 candidates in close to 90% of the cases.

targeting NGC 5548 as part of a larger multi-wavelength reverberation mapping
campaign. The campaign spanned six months and achieved an almost daily cadence
with observations from five ground-based telescopes. The H$\beta$ and He II
$\lambda$4686 broad emission-line light curves lag that of the 5100 $\AA$
optical continuum by $4.17^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ days and $0.79^{+0.35}_{-0.34}$
days, respectively. The H$\beta$ lag relative to the 1158 $\AA$ ultraviolet
continuum light curve measured by the Hubble Space Telescope is roughly
$\sim$50% longer than that measured against the optical continuum, and the lag
difference is consistent with the observed lag between the optical and
ultraviolet continua. This suggests that the characteristic radius of the
broad-line region is $\sim$50% larger than the value inferred from optical data
alone. We also measured velocity-resolved emission-line lags for H$\beta$ and
found a complex velocity-lag structure with shorter lags in the line wings,
indicative of a broad-line region dominated by Keplerian motion. The responses
of both the H$\beta$ and He II $\lambda$4686 emission lines to the driving
continuum changed significantly halfway through the campaign, a phenomenon also
observed for C IV, Ly $\alpha$, He II(+O III]), and Si IV(+O IV]) during the
same monitoring period. Finally, given the optical luminosity of NGC 5548
during our campaign, the measured H$\beta$ lag is a factor of five shorter than
the expected value implied by the $R_\mathrm{BLR} - L_\mathrm{AGN}$ relation
based on the past behavior of NGC 5548.

automatically for autonomous robotic platforms. However, practical deployment
of reinforcement learning methods must contend with the fact that the training
process itself can be unsafe for the robot. In this paper, we consider the
specific case of a mobile robot learning to navigate an a priori unknown
environment while avoiding collisions. In order to learn collision avoidance,
the robot must experience collisions at training time. However, high-speed
collisions, even at training time, could damage the robot. A successful
learning method must therefore proceed cautiously, experiencing only low-speed
collisions until it gains confidence. To this end, we present an
uncertainty-aware model-based learning algorithm that estimates the probability
of collision together with a statistical estimate of uncertainty. By
formulating an uncertainty-dependent cost function, we show that the algorithm
naturally chooses to proceed cautiously in unfamiliar environments, and
increases the velocity of the robot in settings where it has high confidence.
Our predictive model is based on bootstrapped neural networks using dropout,
allowing it to process raw sensory inputs from high-bandwidth sensors such as
cameras. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes dangerous collisions at training time in an obstacle avoidance task

identification of expansion methods for computing accurate, stable
approximations of a quantity of interest. This paper presents, within the
context of uncertainty quantification, a practical implementation using basis
adaptation, and coherence motivated sampling, which under assumptions has
satisfying guarantees. This implementation is referred to as Basis Adaptive
Sample Efficient Polynomial Chaos (BASE-PC). A key component of this is the use
of anisotropic polynomial order which admits evolving global bases for
approximation in an efficient manner, leading to consistently stable
approximation for a practical class of smooth functionals. This fully adaptive,
non-intrusive method, requires no a priori information of the solution, and has
satisfying theoretical guarantees of recovery. A key contribution to stability
is the use of a presented correction sampling for coherence-optimal sampling in
order to improve stability and accuracy within the adaptive basis scheme.
Theoretically, the method may dramatically reduce the impact of dimensionality
in function approximation, and numerically the method is demonstrated to
perform well on problems with dimension up to 1000.

representing the gel. The spatial structure of the normal modes suggests that
measures of collectivity and energy dissipation in the gels are fundamentally
altered by long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions, while hydrodynamic
lubrication affects only the relaxation rates of short wavelength modes. Models
accounting for long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions exhibit a microscopic
relaxation rate for each normal mode, $\lambda$ that scales as $\lambda\sim
l^{-2}$, where $l$ is the spatial correlation length of the mode. For the
freely draining approximation, $\lambda\sim l^\gamma$, where $\gamma$ varies
between 3 and 2 with increasing $\phi$. A simple phenomenological model of the
internal elastic response to normal mode fluctuations is developed, which shows
that long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions play a central role in the
viscoelasticity of the gel network. Dynamic simulations show that the stress
decay as measured by the time-dependent shear modulus matches the normal mode
predictions and the phenomenological model. Analogous to the Zimm model in

hot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) which is
created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this dissertation we
extend and improve upon the existing descriptions of heavy ion collisions in
three different directions: we study the new signatures of initial state
fluctuations, the propagation of perturbations in the early stages of the
collision, and the effect of thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion
of the QGP. First, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to study
event-by-event fluctuations in the spectrum of harmonic flow, $v_n(p_T)$ for
$n=0\text{--}5$, in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\,{\rm TeV}$). The PCA procedure
finds two dominant contributions to the two-particle correlation function: the
leading component is identified with the standard event plane $v_n(p_T)$ and
the subleading component is responsible for factorization breaking and reflects
the radial excitation in the initial state. Second, we use leading order
effective kinetic theory (accurate at weak coupling) to simulate the
pre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow perturbations. We
construct the linear response Green functions, which map initial perturbations
to the energy momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable.
Finally, we develop a set of kinetic equations for thermal noise correlators
which are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We use the
hydro-kinetic equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion
and determine the coefficient of the first fractional power ($\propto 1/(\tau
T)^{3/2}$) of the nonlinear noise corrections to energy momentum tensor.

ER is a challenging task for any automated process. As a remedy, human-powered
ER via crowdsourcing has become popular in recent years. Using crowd to answer
queries is costly and time consuming. Furthermore, crowd-answers can often be
faulty. Therefore, crowd-based ER methods aim to minimize human participation
without sacrificing the quality and use a computer generated similarity matrix
actively. While, some of these methods perform well in practice, no theoretical
analysis exists for them, and further their worst case performances do not
reflect the experimental findings. This creates a disparity in the
understanding of the popular heuristics for this problem. In this paper, we
make the first attempt to close this gap. We provide a thorough analysis of the
prominent heuristic algorithms for crowd-based ER. We justify experimental

the coronal material, and physical understanding of their material origin
remains controversial. Two types of scenarios have been proposed: one argues
that the filament plasma is brought into the corona from photosphere or
chromosphere through a siphon or evaporation/injection process, while the other
suggests that the material condenses from the surrounding coronal plasma due to
thermal instability. The elemental abundance analysis is a reasonable clue to
constrain the models, as the siphon or evaporation/injection model would
predict that the filament material abundances are close to the photospheric or
chromospheric ones, while the condensation model should have coronal
abundances. In this letter, we analyze the elemental abundances of a magnetic
cloud that contains the ejected filament material. The corresponding filament
eruption occurred on 1998 April 29, accompanying an M6.8 class soft X-ray flare

(MBHBs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to vary periodically, on
timescales comparable to the binary's orbital time. If driven by accretion rate
fluctuations, the variability could be isotropic. If dominated by relativistic
Doppler modulation, the variability should instead be anisotropic, resembling a
rotating forward-beamed lighthouse. We consider the infrared (IR) reverberation
of either type of periodic emission by pc-scale circumbinary dust tori. We
predict the phase and amplitude of IR variability as a function of the ratio of
dust light crossing time to the source variability period, and of the torus
inclination and opening angle. We enumerate several differences between the
isotropic and anisotropic cases. Interestingly, for a nearly face-on binary
with an inclined dust torus, the Doppler boost can produce IR variability
without any observable optical/UV variability. Such orphan-IR variability would
have been missed in optical searches for periodic AGN. We apply our models to
time-domain WISE IR data from the MBHB candidate PG 1302-102 and find
consistency with dust reverberation by both isotropically emitting and
Doppler-boosted sources in the shorter wavelength W1-W2 (2.8-5.3 micrometer)
bands. We constrain the dust torus to be thin (aspect ratio ~0.1), with an
inner radius at 1-5 pc. More generally, our dust echo models will aid in
identifying new MBHB candidates, determining their nature, and constraining the

to further increase the data rate of wireless communication systems. The key
idea of FD is to serve multiple users over the same bandwidth with a base
station (BS) that can simultaneously transmit and receive the signals. The most
challenging issue in designing an FD system is to address both the harmful
effects of residual self-interference caused by the transmit-to-receive
antennas at the BS as well as the co- channel interference from an uplink user
(ULU) to a downlink user (DLU). An efficient solution to these problems is to
assign the ULUs/DLUs in different groups/slots, with each user served in
multiple groups. Hence, this paper studies the joint design of transmit
beamformers, ULUs/DLUs group assignment, and time allocation for each group.
The specific aim is to maximize the sum rate under the ULU/DLU minimum
throughput constraints. The utility function of interest is a difficult
nonconcave problem, and the involved constraints are also nonconvex, and so
this is a computationally troublesome problem. To solve this optimization
problem, we propose a new path-following algorithm for compu- tational
solutions to arrive at least the local optima. Each iteration involves only a
simple convex quadratic program. We prove that the proposed algorithm
iteratively improves the objective while guaranteeing convergence. Simulation
results confirm the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm with substantial
performance improvements over existing approaches.

prediction algorithm to predict the forthcoming vehicle trajectory and judge
whether the driver will demonstrate an LDB or a DCB. We also develop a warning
strategy based on the model-based prediction algorithm that allows the
lane-departure warning system to be acceptable for drivers according to the
predicted trajectory. In addition, the naturalistic driving data of 10 drivers
is collected through the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment

Hauptmann and Qinghua Zheng","Simple to Complex Cross-modal Learning to Rank","14 pages; Accepted by Computer Vision and Image Understanding",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The heterogeneity-gap between different modalities brings a significant
challenge to multimedia information retrieval. Some studies formalize the
cross-modal retrieval tasks as a ranking problem and learn a shared multi-modal
embedding space to measure the cross-modality similarity. However, previous
methods often establish the shared embedding space based on linear mapping
functions which might not be sophisticated enough to reveal more complicated
inter-modal correspondences. Additionally, current studies assume that the
rankings are of equal importance, and thus all rankings are used
simultaneously, or a small number of rankings are selected randomly to train
the embedding space at each iteration. Such strategies, however, always suffer
from outliers as well as reduced generalization capability due to their lack of
insightful understanding of procedure of human cognition. In this paper, we
involve the self-paced learning theory with diversity into the cross-modal
learning to rank and learn an optimal multi-modal embedding space based on
non-linear mapping functions. This strategy enhances the model's robustness to
outliers and achieves better generalization via training the model gradually
from easy rankings by diverse queries to more complex ones. An efficient
alternative algorithm is exploited to solve the proposed challenging problem
with fast convergence in practice. Extensive experimental results on several
benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-arts in this literature.

composed of randomly interleaved frequency-selective zone sectors is proposed
to broaden the bandwidth of the two-dimensional device. The validities of the

the fermion determinant in the QCD effective action, we show explicitly how its

colored, Grassmanian particles in background fields. Restricting ourselves for
simplicity to spinning particles, we demonstrate how their constrained
Hamiltonian dynamics arises for both massless and massive particles. In a
semi-classical limit, this gives rise to the covariant generalization of the
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation; the derivation of the corresponding Wong
equations for colored particles is straightforward. In a previous letter we
outlined how Berry's phase arises in a non-relativistic adiabatic limit for
massive particles. We extend the discussion here to systems with a finite
chemical potential. We discuss a path integral formulation of the relative
phase in the fermion determinant that places it on the same footing as the real
part. We construct the corresponding anomalous world-line axial vector current
and show in detail how the chiral anomaly appears. Our work provides a
systematic framework for a relativistic kinetic theory of chiral fermions in
the fluctuating topological backgrounds that generate the CME in a deconfined

(PCA)-derived basis vectors to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the
noise-free data. That work used techniques designed for deterministic data, PCA
was used for the basis function generation and $L_2$ projection was used to
create the reconstructions. In this work, probabilistic approaches are used.
The probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is used to generate the basis, which then allows
the noise in the training data to be estimated. PPCA has also been improved so
that the derived basis vectors are orthonormal and the variance of the basis
expansion coefficients over the training data set can be estimated. The
standard approach assumes a unit variance for these coefficients. Based on the
results of the PPCA, model selection criteria are applied to automatically
choose the dimension of the ROM. In our previous work, a heuristic approach was
used to pick the dimension. Lastly, a new statistical approach is used for the
projection step where the variance information obtained from the improved PPCA
is used as a prior to improve the projection. This gives improved accuracy over
$L_2$ projection when the projected data is noisy. In addition, the noise
statistics for the projected data are not assumed to be the same as that of the
training data, but are estimated in the projection process. The entire approach
gives a fully stochastic method for computing a ROM from noisy training data,
determining ideal model selection, and projecting noisy test data, thus
enabling accurate predictions of noise-free data from data that is dominated by

geo-locating an image using image matching in a structured database of
city-wide reference images with known GPS coordinates. We cast the
geo-localization as a clustering problem on local image features. Akin to
existing approaches on the problem, our framework builds on low-level features
which allow partial matching between images. For each local feature in the
query image, we find its approximate nearest neighbors in the reference set.
Next, we cluster the features from reference images using Dominant Set
clustering, which affords several advantages over existing approaches. First,
it permits variable number of nodes in the cluster which we use to dynamically
select the number of nearest neighbors (typically coming from multiple
reference images) for each query feature based on its discrimination value.
Second, as we also quantify in our experiments, this approach is several orders
of magnitude faster than existing approaches. Thus, we obtain multiple clusters
(different local maximizers) and obtain a robust final solution to the problem
using multiple weak solutions through constrained Dominant Set clustering on
global image features, where we enforce the constraint that the query image
must be included in the cluster. This second level of clustering also bypasses
heuristic approaches to voting and selecting the reference image that matches
to the query. We evaluated the proposed framework on an existing dataset of
102k street view images as well as a new dataset of 300k images, and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 20% and 7%, respectively, on the two

family of antibiotics are hydrolyzed by NDM-1 in an efficient manner. Here we
report the detailed molecular mechanism of NDM-1 catalyzed hydrolysis of
cephalexin, a cephalosporin family drug, and meropenem, a carbapenem family
drug. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using hybrid
quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods at the density
functional theory level, based on which reaction pathways and the associated
free energies are obtained. We find that the mechanism and the free energy
barrier for the ring-opening step are the same for both the drug molecules,
while the subsequent protonation step differs. In particular, we observe that
the mechanism of the protonation step depends on the R2 group of the drug
molecule. Our simulations show that allylic carbon protonation occurs in the
case of cephalexin drug molecule where Lys211 is the proton donor and the
proton transfer occurs via a water chain formed (only) at the ring-opened
intermediate structure. Based on the free energy profiles, the overall kinetics
of the drug hydrolysis is discussed. Finally, we show that the proposed
mechanisms and free energy profiles could explain various experimental
observations.

generic modeling of such networks as typical MANETs and isolated systems has
left various vulnerabilities out of the investigative focus of the research
community. This paper aims to emphasize on some of the critical challenges in
securing UAV networks against attacks targeting vulnerabilities specific to
such systems and their cyber-physical aspects.

  Waves, and Hop-and-Spread Disease Dynamics",,,,,"q-bio.QM nlin.PS physics.bio-ph physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random network models play a prominent role in modeling, analyzing and
understanding complex phenomena on real-life networks. However, a key property
of networks is often neglected: many real-world networks exhibit spatial
structure, the tendency of a node to select neighbors with a probability
depending on physical distance. Here, we introduce a class of random spatial
networks (RSNs) which generalizes many existing random network models but adds
spatial structure. In these networks, nodes are placed randomly in space and
joined in edges with a probability depending on their distance and their
individual expected degrees, in a manner that crucially remains analytically
tractable. We use this network class to propose a new generalization of
small-world networks, where the average shortest path lengths in the graph are
small, as in classical Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, but with close
spatial proximity of nodes that are neighbors in the network playing the role
of large clustering. Small-world effects are demonstrated on these spatial
small-world networks without clustering. We are able to derive partial
integro-differential equations governing susceptible-infectious-recovered
disease spreading through an RSN, and we demonstrate the existence of traveling
wave solutions. If the distance kernel governing edge placement decays slower
than exponential, the population-scale dynamics are dominated by long-range
hops followed by local spread of traveling waves. This provides a theoretical
modeling framework for recent observations of how epidemics like Ebola evolve
in modern connected societies, with long-range connections seeding new focal
points from which the epidemic locally spreads in a wavelike manner.

the polarity cues distribution and daughter cell fates depend on the correct
positioning of the mitotic spindle, which results from both centering and
cortical pulling forces. Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling
forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn
consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of
these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule
availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull.
Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99
cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior
crescent. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex.
Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the
centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it
modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control,
predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent
controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic
progression. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to
a posterior crescent sets the spindle's final position, reflecting polarity
through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior
crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity.
This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force
generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold
needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in
cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.

the region from which the emission escapes can be very small. We estimated the

In all cases high brightness temperatures were obtained. For the higher value
of the density scale height, the brightness temperature was estimated as 1.1

of a vector $X$ quickly, and using few samples in time domain, is known as the
Sparse Fourier Transform (sparse FFT) problem. A long line of work on the
sparse FFT has resulted in algorithms with $O(k\log n\log (n/k))$ runtime
[Hassanieh et al., STOC'12] and $O(k\log n)$ sample complexity [Indyk et al.,
FOCS'14]. These results are proved using non-adaptive algorithms, and the
latter $O(k\log n)$ sample complexity result is essentially the best possible
under the sparsity assumption alone.
  This paper revisits the sparse FFT problem with the added twist that the
sparse coefficients approximately obey a $(k_0,k_1)$-block sparse model. In
this model, signal frequencies are clustered in $k_0$ intervals with width
$k_1$ in Fourier space, where $k= k_0k_1$ is the total sparsity. Signals
arising in applications are often well approximated by this model with $k_0\ll
k$.
  Our main result is the first sparse FFT algorithm for $(k_0, k_1)$-block
sparse signals with the sample complexity of $O^*(k_0k_1 + k_0\log(1+ k_0)\log
n)$ at constant signal-to-noise ratios, and sublinear runtime. A similar sample
complexity was previously achieved in the works on model-based compressive
sensing using random Gaussian measurements, but used $\Omega(n)$ runtime. To
the best of our knowledge, our result is the first sublinear-time algorithm for
model based compressed sensing, and the first sparse FFT result that goes below
the $O(k\log n)$ sample complexity bound.
  Our algorithm crucially uses {\em adaptivity} to achieve the improved sample
complexity bound, and we prove that adaptivity is in fact necessary if Fourier
measurements are used: Any non-adaptive algorithm must use $\Omega(k_0k_1\log
\frac{n}{k_0k_1})$ samples for the $(k_0,k_1$)-block sparse model, ruling out
improvements over the vanilla sparsity assumption.

Recently, combinatorial extensions such as matroid or matching secretary
problems have become an important tool to study algorithmic problems in dynamic
markets. Here the decision maker must know the numerical value of each arriving
element, which can be a demanding informational assumption. In this paper, we
initiate the study of combinatorial secretary problems with ordinal
information, in which the decision maker only needs to be aware of a preference
order consistent with the values of arrived elements. The goal is to design
online algorithms with small competitive ratios.
  For a variety of combinatorial problems, such as bipartite matching, general
packing LPs, and independent set with bounded local independence number, we
design new algorithms that obtain constant competitive ratios.
  For the matroid secretary problem, we observe that many existing algorithms
for special matroid structures maintain their competitive ratios even in the
ordinal model. In these cases, the restriction to ordinal information does not
represent any additional obstacle. Moreover, we show that ordinal variants of
the submodular matroid secretary problems can be solved using algorithms for
the linear versions by extending [Feldman and Zenklusen, 2015]. In contrast, we
provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/(\log n))$ for algorithms that are
oblivious to the matroid structure, where $n$ is the total number of elements.
This contrasts an upper bound of $O(\log n)$ in the cardinal model, and it
shows that the technique of thresholding is not sufficient for good algorithms
in the ordinal model.

there are possibly detectable differences in the growth of the matter
perturbations for different modes of the perturbations, even in the context of
the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we analyze the evolution of the dark matter
perturbations in the context of $\Lambda$CDM and some dynamical dark energy
models involving future cosmological singularities, such as the sudden future
singularity and the finite scale factor singularity. We employ the Newtonian
gauge formulation for the derivation of the perturbation equations for the
growth function, and we abandon both the sub-Hubble approximation and the
slowly varying potential assumption. We apply the Fisher Matrix approach to
three future planned galaxy surveys e.g., DESI, Euclid, and WFirst-2.4. With
the mentioned surveys on hand, only with the dynamical probes, we will achieve
multiple goals: $1.$ the improvement in the accuracy of the determination of
the $f\sigma_{8}$ will give the possibility to discriminate between the
$\Lambda$CDM and the alternative dark energy models even in the
scale-independent approach; $2.$ it will be possible to test the goodness of
the scale-independence finally, and also to quantify the necessity of a scale
dependent approach to the growth of the perturbations, in particular using
surveys which encompass redshift bins with scales $k<0.005\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$; $3.$
the scale-dependence itself might add much more discriminating power in

the relation between energy density, curvature invariants, and geodesic
completeness using a quadratic $f(R)$ gravity theory coupled to an anisotropic
fluid. Working in a metric-affine approach, our models and solutions represent
minimal extensions of General Relativity (GR) in the sense that they rapidly
recover the usual Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m solution from near the inner horizon
outwards. The anisotropic fluid helps modify only the innermost geometry.
Depending on the values and signs of two parameters on the gravitational and
matter sectors, a breakdown of the correlations between the
finiteness/divergence of the energy density, the behavior of curvature
invariants, and the (in)completeness of geodesics is obtained. We find a
variety of configurations with and without wormholes, a case with a de Sitter
interior, solutions that mimic non-linear models of electrodynamics coupled to
GR, and configurations with up to four horizons. Our results raise questions
regarding what infinities, if any, a quantum version of these theories should
regularize.

  of Training Samples",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Learning (DL) methods show very good performance when trained on large,
balanced data sets. However, many practical problems involve imbalanced data
sets, or/and classes with a small number of training samples. The performance
of DL methods as well as more traditional classifiers drops significantly in
such settings. Most of the existing solutions for imbalanced problems focus on
customizing the data for training. A more principled solution is to use mixed
Hinge-Minimax risk [19] specifically designed to solve binary problems with
imbalanced training sets. Here we propose a Latent Hinge Minimax (LHM) risk and
a training algorithm that generalizes this paradigm to an ensemble of
hyperplanes that can form arbitrary complex, piecewise linear boundaries. To
extract good features, we combine LHM model with CNN via transfer learning. To
solve multi-class problem we map pre-trained category-specific LHM classifiers
to a multi-class neural network and adjust the weights with very fast tuning.
LHM classifier enables the use of unlabeled data in its training and the
mapping allows for multi-class inference, resulting in a classifier that
performs better than alternatives when trained on a small number of training
samples.

temperature window from (140 MeV, 150 MeV) to (140 MeV, 170 MeV). The strange
quark mass was chosen to its physical value $m_{s}^{\mathrm{phy}}$, and five
values of two degenerate light quark masses are varied from
$m_{s}^{\mathrm{phy}}/80$ to $m_{s}^{\mathrm{phy}}/20$ which correspond to a
Goldstone pion mass ranging from 80 MeV to 160 MeV in the continuum limit. The
universal scaling behaviour of the QCD chiral phase transition is investigated
by studying the temperature and quark mass dependences of chiral condensates
and chiral susceptibilities. The window of criticality compared to previous
studies is also discussed.

run on battery-powered mobile devices with limited energy budget. In short, the
essence of these challenges is that performance should be improved while
simultaneously reducing energy consumption, two rather contradicting goals by
conventional wisdom. In this paper, we take a close look at state-of-the-art

isospin-breaking effects due to electromagnetism in QCD. This smallness
complicates determining isospin breaking from lattice QCD computations that
include electromagnetism. One solution to this problem consists of performing
computations using larger-than-physical values of the electric charge, and
subsequently extrapolating (or interpolating) to the physical value of the
fine-structure constant. Motivated by recent lattice QCD + QED computations of
electromagnetic masses employing this setup, we consider finite-volume effects
arising from the use of larger-than-physical electric charges. A modified
power-counting scheme, which is based on treating the fine-structure constant
as larger than its physical value, is explored. Results for perturbative QED
corrections, however, are surprising. Within the framework of non-relativistic
QED, multi-loop diagrams exhibit a momentum factorization property that
produces exact cancellations. We determine that power-law finite-volume effects
vanish at the leading two- and three-loop order, as well as the next-to-leading
two-loop order. For larger-than-physical charges, we consequently expect no
appreciable volume corrections beyond leading-order QED.

availability of caching helpers in a wireless caching system. More explicitly,
we consider a general system consisting of a caching helper with its dedicated
user in proximity and another non-dedicated user requesting for content. Both
the non-dedicated user and the helper have limited storage capabilities. When
the user is not able to locate the requested content in its own cache, then its
request shall be served either by the caching helper or by a large data center.
Assuming bursty request arrivals at the caching helper from its dedicated
destination, its availability to serve other users is affected by the request
rate, which will further affect the system throughput and the delay experienced
by the non-dedicated user. We characterize the maximum weighted throughput and
the average delay per packet of the considered system, taking into account the
request arrival rate of the caching helper, the request probability of the user
and the availability of the data center. Our results provide fundamental
insights in the throughput and delay behavior of such systems, which are
essential for further investigation in larger topologies.

we present one of the most accurate measurements of the Cosmic X-ray Background
(CXB) spectrum to date in the [0.3-7] keV energy band. The CXB has three
distinct components: contributions from two Galactic collisional thermal
plasmas at kT$\sim$0.27 and 0.07 keV and an extragalactic power-law with photon
spectral index $\Gamma$=1.45$\pm{0.02}$. The 1 keV normalization of the
extragalactic component is 10.91$\pm{0.16}$ keV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$
keV$^{-1}$. Removing all X-ray detected sources, the remaining unresolved CXB
is best-fit by a power-law with normalization 4.18$\pm{0.26}$ keV cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ and photon spectral index
$\Gamma$=1.57$\pm{0.10}$. Removing faint galaxies down to i$_{AB}\sim$27-28
leaves a hard spectrum with $\Gamma\sim$1.25 and a 1 keV normalization of
$\sim$1.37 keV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$. This means that
$\sim$91\% of the observed CXB is resolved into detected X-ray sources and
undetected galaxies. Unresolved sources that contribute $\sim 8-9\%$ of the
total CXB show a marginal evidence of being harder and possibly more obscured
than resolved sources. Another $\sim$1\% of the CXB can be attributed to still
undetected star forming galaxies and absorbed AGN. According to these limits,
we investigate a scenario where early black holes totally account for non
source CXB fraction and constrain some of their properties. In order to not
exceed the remaining CXB and the $z\sim$6 accreted mass density, such a
population of black holes must grow in Compton-thick envelopes with
N$_{H}>$1.6$\times$10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ and form in extremely low metallicity
environments $(Z_\odot)\sim10^{-3}$.

multiplication on a processor with two layers of memory is established. Prior
work obtained weaker lower bounds by reasoning about the number of segments
needed to perform $C:=AB$, for distinct matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$, where each
segment is a series of operations involving $M$ reads and writes to and from
fast memory, and $M$ is the size of fast memory. A lower bound on the number of
segments was then determined by obtaining an upper bound on the number of
elementary multiplications performed per segment. This paper follows the same
high level approach, but improves the lower bound by (1) transforming
algorithms for MMM so that they perform all computation via fused multiply-add
instructions (FMAs) and using this to reason about only the cost associated
with reading the matrices, and (2) decoupling the per-segment I/O cost from the
size of fast memory. For $n \times n$ matrices, the lower bound's leading-order
term is $2n^3/\sqrt{M}$. A theoretical algorithm whose leading terms attains
this is introduced. To what extent the state-of-the-art Goto's Algorithm
attains the lower bound is discussed.
