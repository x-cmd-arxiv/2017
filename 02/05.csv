  plasmons in AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas","4.5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The advance of terahertz science and technology yet lays wait for the
breakthrough in high-efficiency and high-power solid-state terahertz sources
applicable at room temperature. Plasmon in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
has long been pursued as a type of promising active medium for terahertz
emitters. However, a high wall-plug efficiency sufficient for high-power
operation has not been achieved. Here we report spontaneous terahertz emission
tunable in a frequency range from 0.3 to 2.5 THz through electrical excitation
of plasmon or plasmon-polariton modes in a grating-gate coupled AlGaN/GaN 2DEG
at 7 K. A wall-plug efficiency ranging from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-1}$ is found by
tuning the energy (4.5 eV to 0.5 eV) of tunneling electrons between the grating
gates and the 2DEG. The total emission power, albeit below 15 nW, is already
detectable by using a direct terahertz field-effect transistor detector based
on the same type of 2DEG. The findings indicate that both high-efficiency and
high-power terahertz plasmon-polariton emission could be obtained by a proper
injection of tunneling electrons with low energy and high current density.

star, mid-F supergiant Alpha Persei: the X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness
were similar to coronally active late-type dwarf members. Later, in 2010, a
Hubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found
far-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. This, and a suspicious
offset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be
responsible for the X-rays. Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that
premise. Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide
Field Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but
without success. Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and
coincident with the bright star. Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha
Persei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint
program, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic
to the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G
supergiants, including Cepheid variables. This pointed to the X-rays as the
fundamental anomaly. The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a
hyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. However, an
alternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.
Resolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy
solution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated. Testing the
other possibility will require a broader high-energy census of the early-F
supergiants.

information, steganography is done only for face texture, and for
reconstructing 3D face, we can use any other shape. Moreover, we will indicate
that, by using two textures, how two 3D faces can be combined. For a complete
description of the process, first, 2D faces are used as an input for building
3D faces, and then 3D textures are hidden within other images.

  Poisson-Binomial Distribution","14 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Poisson-binomial distribution is useful in many applied problems in
engineering, actuarial science, and data mining. The Poisson-binomial
distribution models the distribution of the sum of independent but not
identically distributed Bernoulli random variables whose success probabilities
vary. In this paper, we extend the Poisson-binomial distribution to the
generalized Poisson-binomial (GPB) distribution. The GPB distribution is
defined in cases where the Bernoulli variables can take any two arbitrary
values instead of 0 and~1. The GPB distribution is useful in many areas such as
voting theory, actuarial science, warranty prediction, and probability theory.
With few previous works studying the GPB distribution, we derive the
probability distribution via the discrete Fourier transform of the
characteristic function of the distribution. We develop an efficient algorithm
for computing the distribution function, which uses the fast Fourier transform.
We test the accuracy of the developed algorithm upon comparing it with
enumeration-based exact method and the results from the binomial distribution.
We also study the computational time of the algorithm in various parameter
settings. Finally, we discus the factors affecting the computational efficiency
of this algorithm, and illustrate the use of the software package.

limit both scalability and reach of such tools in practice. We therefore
present a tool, ManyOpt, for MINLP optimization that enables experimentation
with reduction techniques which transform a MINLP problem to feasibility

ManySAT in that it runs a specified number of such reduction techniques in
parallel to get the strongest result on a given MINLP problem. The tool is
implemented in layers, which we may see as features and where reduction
techniques are feature vectors. Some of these features are inspired by known
MINLP techniques whereas others are novel and specific to SMT. Our experimental
results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of this approach. The
tool supports a variety of SMT solvers and is easily extensible with new
features, courtesy of its layered structure. For example, logical formulas for
deductive reasoning are easily added to constrain further the optimization of a

drive the transport between the surfaces. Time-dependent simulations solving
the Poisson equation self-consistently with the Nernst-Planck flux equations
for the mobile species are performed. In the resulting Poisson-Nernst-Planck
system of equations, the electrostatic potential is obtained from the Poisson
equation in its integral form by summation. The model is used to interpret
alumina membrane oxygen permeation experiments, in which different oxygen gas
pressures are applied at opposite membrane surfaces and the resulting flux of
oxygen molecules through the membrane is measured. Simulation results involving
four mobile species, charged aluminum and oxygen vacancies, electrons, and
holes, provide a complete description of the measurements and insight into the
microscopic processes underpinning the oxygen permeation of the membrane. Most
notably, the hypothesized transition between p-type and n-type ionic
conductivity of the alumina grain boundaries as a function of the applied
oxygen gas pressure is observed in the simulations. The range of validity of a
simple analytic model for the oxygen permeation rate, similar to the Wagner

results obtained using the linearized Boltzmann-BGK equation for values of the
Knudsen number (Kn) up to $100$. We find that recovering the non-linear part of
the velocity profile (i.e., its deviation from a linear function) at ${\rm Kn}
\gtrsim 1$ requires high quadrature orders. We then employ the Shakhov model
for the collision term to obtain macroscopic profiles for Maxwell molecules
using the standard $\mu \sim T^\omega$ law, as well as for monatomic Helium and
Argon gases, modeled through ab-initio potentials, where the viscosity is
recovered using the Sutherland model. We validate our implementation by
comparison with DSMC results and find excellent match for all macroscopic

deviations can be seen in the profiles of the diagonal components of the

arbitrary ring $R$. For this sake, we introduce and study the notion of a
fibred AF-ring over a ring $R$. This concept extends naturally the notion of
AF-ring over a field introduced by A. Wadsworth in \cite{W} to algebras over
arbitrary rings. We prove that Wadsworth theorems express local properties
related to the fibre rings of tensor products of algebras over a ring. Also,
given a triplet of rings $(R,A,B)$ consisting of two $R$-algebras $A$ and $B$
such that $A\otimes_RB\neq \{0\}$, we introduce the inherent notion to
$(R,A,B)$ of a $B$-fibred AF-ring which allows to compute the Krull dimension
of all fiber rings of the considered tensor product $A\otimes_RB$. As an
application, we provide a formula for the Krull dimension of $A\otimes_RB$ when
$A$ and $B$ are $R$-algebras with $A$ is zero-dimensional as well as for the
Krull dimension of $A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}B$ when $A$ is a fibred AF-ring over
the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with nonzero characteristic and $B$ is an
arbitrary ring. This enables us to answer a question of Jorge Matinez on
evaluating the Krull dimension of $A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}B$ when $A$ is a
Boolean ring. Actually, we prove that if $A$ and $B$ are rings such that
$A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}B$ is not trivial and $A$ is a Boolean ring, then
dim$(A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}B)=\mbox {dim}\Big (\displaystyle {\frac B{2B}}\Big
)$.

give rise to overlapping of signals due to spherical sensing range which leads
to information redundancy in the network. To address this problem, we develop a
sensing algorithm for 3D-WSN based on dodecahedron topology which we call Three
Dimensional Distributed Clustering (3D-DC) algorithm. Using 3D-DC algorithm in
3D-WSN, accurate information extraction appears to be a major challenge due to
the environmental noise where a Cluster Head (CH) node gathers and estimates
information in each dodecahedron cluster. Hence, to extract precise information
in each dodecahedron cluster, we propose Three Dimensional Information
Estimation (3D-IE) algorithm. Moreover, Node deployment strategy also plays an
important factor to maximize information accuracy in 3D-WSN. In most cases,
sensor nodes are deployed deterministically or randomly. But both the
deployment scenario are not aware of where to exactly place the sensor nodes to
extract more information in terms of accuracy. Therefore, placing nodes in its
appropriate positions in 3D-WSN is a challenging task. We propose a Three
Dimensional Node Placement (3D-NP) algorithm which can find the possible nodes
and their deployment strategy to maximize information accuracy in the network.
We perform simulations using MATLAB to validate the 3D-DC, 3D-IE and 3D-NP,
algorithms respectively.

propensity score (PS) model, we consider a dimension reduction of $\mathbf{X}$
based on fitting both working PS and outcome models using adaptive LASSO. A
novel PS estimator, the Double-index Propensity Score (DiPS), is proposed, in
which the treatment status is smoothed over the linear predictors for
$\mathbf{X}$ from both the initial working models. The ATE is estimated by
using the DiPS in a normalized inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator,
which is found to maintain double-robustness and also local semiparametric
efficiency with a fixed number of covariates $p$. Under misspecification of
working models, the smoothing step leads to gains in efficiency and robustness
over traditional doubly-robust estimators. These results are extended to the
case where $p$ diverges with sample size and working models are sparse.
Simulations show the benefits of the approach in finite samples. We illustrate
the method by estimating the ATE of statins on colorectal cancer risk in an
electronic medical record (EMR) study and the effect of smoking on C-reactive

Si leading to the deviation of Si atoms from the theoretical random
distribution. This departure from an ideal solid solution is supported by first
principal calculations and attributed to the tendency of the system to reduce
its mixing enthalpy throughout the layer-by-layer growth process.

independent electrons. In particular, the deviation in bcc Fe (fcc Ni) is shown

however, how well this heuristic kernel agrees with the exact hyperspherical

marginal distributions along many different axes in phase space, which forms a
basis of quantum state tomography. We theoretically propose and experimentally
demonstrate a general framework to manifest nonclassicality by observing a
single marginal distribution only, which provides a novel insight into
nonclassicality and a practical applicability to various quantum systems. Our
approach maps the 1-dim marginal distribution into a factorized 2-dim
distribution by multiplying the measured distribution or the vacuum-state
distribution along an orthogonal axis. The resulting fictitious Wigner function
becomes unphysical only for a nonclassical state, thus the negativity of the
corresponding density operator provides an evidence of nonclassicality.
Furthermore, the negativity measured this way yields a lower bound for
entanglement potential---a measure of entanglement generated using a
nonclassical state with a beam splitter setting that is a prototypical model to
produce continuous-variable (CV) entangled states. Our approach detects both
Gaussian and non-Gaussian nonclassical states in a reliable and efficient
manner. Remarkably, it works regardless of measurement axis for all
non-Gaussian states in finite-dimensional Fock space of any size, also
extending to infinite-dimensional states of experimental relevance for CV
quantum informatics. We experimentally illustrate the power of our criterion
for motional states of a trapped ion confirming their nonclassicality in a
measurement-axis independent manner. We also address an extension of our
approach combined with phase-shift operations, which leads to a stronger test

properly illustrate the stochastic nature of neurons. Among different
approaches, the noisy leaky integrate-and-fire and the escape rate models are
probably the most popular. These two models are usually chosen to express
different noise action over the neural cell. In this paper we investigate the
link between the two formalisms in the case of a neuron subject to a time
dependent input. To this aim, we introduce a new general stochastic framework.
As we shall prove, our general framework entails the two already existing ones.
Our result has theoretical implications since it offers a general view upon the
two stochastic processes mostly used in neuroscience, upon the way they can be
linked, and explain their observed statistical similarity.

a radio station system used for detection of cosmic ray induced air showers at
the Engineering Radio Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the so-called

characteristics of the broadband antenna are investigated using a remotely
piloted aircraft (RPA) carrying a small transmitting antenna. The antenna
sensitivity is described by the vector effective length relating the measured
voltage with the electric-field components perpendicular to the incoming signal
direction. The horizontal and meridional components are determined with an
overall uncertainty of 7.4^{+0.9}_{-0.3} % and 10.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7} %
respectively. The measurement is used to correct a simulated response of the
frequency and directional response of the antenna. In addition, the influence
of the ground conductivity and permittivity on the antenna response is
simulated. Both have a negligible influence given the ground conditions
measured at the detector site. The overall uncertainties of the vector
effective length components result in an uncertainty of 8.8^{+2.1}_{-1.3} % in
the square root of the energy fluence for incoming signal directions with
zenith angles smaller than 60{\deg}.

for expressing generic time series data. Already existing IVOA data models are
reused as much as possible. The model is also made as generic as possible to be
open to new extensions but at the same time closed for modifications. This
enables maintaining interoperability throughout different versions of the data
model. We define the necessary building blocks for metadata discovery,
serialization of time series data and understanding it by clients. We present
several categories of time series science cases with examples of
implementation. We also take into account the most pressing topics for time
series providers like tracking original images for every individual point of a
light curve or time-derived axes like frequency for gravitational wave
analysis. The main motivation for the creation of a new model is to provide a
unified time series data publishing standard - not only for light curves but
also more generic time series data, e.g., radial velocity curves, power
spectra, hardness ratio, provenance linkage, etc. The flexibility is the most
crucial part of our model - we are not dependent on any physical domain or
frame models. While images or spectra are already stable and standardized
products, the time series related domains are still not completely evolved and
new ones will likely emerge in near future. That is why we need to keep models
like Time Series Cube DM independent of any underlying physical models. In our
opinion, this is the only correct and sustainable way for future development of
IVOA standards.

reaching a neutrino sensitivity of 5.10$^{11}$ E$^{-2}$

been algorithmically recommended. We find that the evolution of ego-networks is

popular and well-connected nodes, limiting the diameter expansion. With a

temporal argument is decomposed into two parts. The former captures the linear
argument, which is related, for instance, to the annual evolution of the field.
The latter is instead a circular variable describing, for instance, monthly
observations. The basic intuition behind this construction is to consider a
random field defined over space (a compact set of the $d$-dimensional Euclidean
space) across time, which is considered as the product space $\mathbb{R} \times
\mathbb{S}^1$, with $\mathbb{S}^1$ being the unit circle. Under such framework,
we derive new parametric families of covariance functions. In particular, we
focus on two classes of parametric families. The former being parenthetical to
the Gneiting class of covariance functions. The latter is instead obtained by
proposing a new Lagrangian framework for the space-time domain considered in
the manuscript. Our findings are illustrated through a real dataset of surface
air temperatures. We show that the incorporation of both temporal variables can
produce significant improvements in the predictive performances of the model.
We also discuss the extension of this approach for fields defined spatially on
a sphere, which allows to model space-time phenomena over large portions of
planet Earth.

results which depend on both scattering length and effective range of the

temperature including one-loop Gaussian fluctuation. In the case of zero-range
effective interaction we explicitly show that, due to quantum fluctuations, the
bosonic system is thermodynamically stable only for very small values of the
gas parameter. We find that a positive effective range above a critical
threshold is necessary to remove the thermodynamical instability of the uniform

fluctuating Stokesian fluid contains passive, active, and Brownian
contributions. Here we derive these three parts systematically, by ""projecting
out"" the fluid using the boundary-domain integral representation of slow
viscous flow. We find an exact relation between the statistics of the Brownian
traction and the thermal forces in the fluid and derive, thereby,
fluctuation-dissipation relations for every irreducible tensorial harmonic
traction mode. The first two modes give the Brownian force and torque, from
which we construct the Langevin and Smoluchowski equations for the position and
orientation of the colloid. We emphasize the activity-induced breakdown of
detailed balance and provide a prescription for computing the
configuration-dependent variances of the Brownian force and torque. We apply
these general results to an active colloid near a plane wall, the simplest
geometry with configuration-dependent variances, and show that the stationary
distribution is non-Gibbsian. We derive a regularization of the translational
and rotational friction tensors, necessary for Brownian dynamics simulations,
that ensures positive variances at all distances from the wall. The many-body
generalization of these results is indicated.

is suppressed exponentially by a non trivial factor which indicates a faster
decay of two point correlations with larger separations. On the other hand, in
the limit of large background deformations ($ \kappa \gg 1 $), the
corresponding two point function reaches a point of saturation. In our

tagged photon beam of the A2 experiment at the Mainz MAMI accelerator was used

almost $4\pi$ detector setup of the Crystal Ball and TAPS is ideally suited to
detect the recoil nucleons and the decay photons from $\eta\rightarrow 2\gamma$

previously observed in $\eta$ photoproduction from the neutron is only apparent
in $\sigma_{1/2}$ and hence, most likely related to a spin-1/2 amplitude.
Nucleon resonances that contribute to this partial wave in $\eta$ production
are only $N1/2^-$ ($S_{11}$) and $N1/2^+$ ($P_{11}$). Furthermore, the
extracted Legendre coefficients of the angular distributions for $\sigma_{1/2}$

business analytics is that they do not generalize well and often fail when
applied to new data. One of the possible approaches to this problem is to
enrich these methods (which are almost exclusively based on statistical
algorithms) with some intrinsically deterministic add-ons borrowed from
theoretical physics. The idea proposed in this note is to divide the set of Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) characterizing an individual business into the
following two distinct groups: 1) highly volatile KPIs mostly determined by
external factors and thus poorly controllable by a business, and 2) relatively
stable KPIs identified and controlled by a business itself. It looks like,
whereas the dynamics of the first group can, as before, be studied using
statistical methods, for studying and optimizing the dynamics of the second
group it is better to use deterministic principles similar to the Principle of
Least Action of classical mechanics. Such approach opens a whole bunch of new
interesting opportunities in business analytics, with numerous practical
applications including diverse aspects of operational and strategic planning,
change management, ROI optimization, etc. Uncovering and utilizing dynamical
laws of the controllable KPIs would also allow one to use dynamical invariants
of business as the most natural sets of risk and performance indicators, and
facilitate business growth by using effects of parametric resonance with
natural business cycles.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa5f57",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the early-phase spectra and the light curves of the broad-lined
supernova (SN) 2016coi from $t=7$ to $67$ days after the estimated explosion
date. This SN was initially reported as a broad-lined Type SN Ic (SN Ic-BL).
However, we found that spectra up to $t=12$ days exhibited the He~{\sc i}
$\lambda$5876, $\lambda$6678, and $\lambda$7065 absorption lines. We show that
the smoothed and blueshifted spectra of normal SNe Ib are remarkably similar to
the observed spectrum of SN 2016coi. The line velocities of SN 2016coi were
similar to those of SNe Ic-BL and significantly faster than those of SNe Ib.
Analyses of the line velocity and light curve suggest that the kinetic energy
and the total ejecta mass of SN 2016coi are similar to those of SNe Ic-BL.
Together with broad-lined SNe 2009bb and 2012ap for which the detection of
He~{\sc i} were also reported, these SNe could be transitional objects between
SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ib, and be classified as broad-lined Type `Ib' SNe (SNe
`Ib'-BL). Our work demonstrates the diversity of the outermost layer in
broad-lined SNe, which should be related to the variety of the evolutionary
paths.

construct Lovelock gravity's rainbow. Considering the Lovelock gravity's
rainbow coupled to linear and also nonlinear electromagnetic gauge fields, we
present two new classes of topological black hole solutions. We compute
conserved and thermodynamic quantities of these black holes (such as
temperature, entropy, electric potential, charge and mass) and show that these
quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. In order to study the
thermal stability in canonical ensemble, we calculate the heat capacity and
determinant of the Hessian matrix and show in what regions there are thermally
stable phases for black holes. Also, we discuss the dependence of thermodynamic
behavior and thermal stability of black holes on rainbow functions. Finally, we
investigate the critical behavior of black holes in the extended phase space
and study their interesting properties.

  Mobility Flows",,,,,"cs.CY cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In urban transportation systems, mobility flows in the subway system reflect
the spatial and temporal dynamics of working days. To investigate the
variability of mobility flows, we analyse the spatial community through a
series of snapshots of subway stations over sequential periods. Using Shanghai
as a case study, we find that the spatial community snapshots reveal dynamic
passenger activities. Adopting a dual-perspective, we apply spatial and
temporal models separately to explore where and when individuals travel for
entertainment. In the two models, microblog topics and spatial facilities such
as food venues and entertainment businesses are used to characterise the
spatial popularity of each station and people's travelling perceptions. In the
studied case, the city centre is characterised by greater social influence, and
it is better described by the spatial model. In the temporal model, shorter
travel distances motivate individuals to start their trips earlier.
Interestingly, as the number of food-related facilities near the starting
station increases, until it exceeds 1563, the speed of people's journeys slows
down. This study provides a method for modelling the effects of social features
on mobility flows and for predicting the spatial-temporal mobility flows of
newly built subway stations.

and uniqueness of solution to the Possio equation is verified for the steady

then calculated based on the approximate solution. Moreover, the divergence
