method for linear feasibility problems, the algorithm consists of a basic
procedure and a step where the solutions are confined to the intersection of a
half-space and K. Following an earlier work by Kitahara and Tsuchiya on second
order cone feasibility problems, progress is measured through the volumes of
those intersections: when they become sufficiently small, we know it is time to
stop. We never have to explicitly compute the volumes, it is only necessary to
keep track of the reductions between iterations. We show this is enough to
obtain concrete upper bounds to the minimum eigenvalues of a scaled version of
the original feasibility problem. Another distinguishing feature of our
approach is the usage of a spectral norm that takes into account the way that K
is decomposed as simple cones. In several key cases, including semidefinite
programming and second order cone programming, these norms make it possible to
obtain better complexity bounds for the basic procedure when compared to a
recent approach by Pe\~na and Soheili. Finally, in the appendix, we present a
translation of the algorithm to the homogeneous feasibility problem in
semidefinite programming.

attributes such as age group, gender, geographic location, or due to a
network's structural dynamics such as triadic closure and preferential

  A number of network generation models have been proposed in the last decade

types of networks, and notably social networks. Network generation models
studied in the literature primarily consider structural properties, and in some
cases an individual's demographic profile in the formation of new social
contacts. These models do not present a mechanism to combine both structural

we propose a new network generation algorithm which incorporates both these

then to use some method of ancestral state inference based on that tree. One of

this method and on ancestral state inference for fully bifurcating trees. In

1995 concerning the number of species which need to have a particular state,
say $a$, at a particular site in order for MP to unambiguously return $a$ as an
estimate for the state of the last common ancestor. We prove the conjecture for
all even numbers of character states, which is the most relevant case in
biology. We also show that the conjecture does not hold in general for odd

regions of low turbulent diffusivity is a unique feature of inhomogeneous
turbulent flows, such as free shear flows or wall-bounded flows. In this work,
the theory for clustering of weakly inertial particles in homogeneous
turbulence is extended to the inhomogeneous case of a turbulent channel flow.
The inhomogeneity contributes to the cluster formation in addition to
clustering in homogeneous turbulence. A space-dependent rate for the creation
of inhomogeneous particle concentration is derived in terms of local statistics
of turbulence. We provide the formula for the pair-correlation function of
concentration that factorizes in product of time and space-dependent average
concentrations and time-independent factor of clustering that obeys a power-law
in the distance between the points. This power-law characterizes inhomogeneous
multifractality of the particle distribution. A unique demonstration and
quantification of the combined effects of turbophoresis and fractal clustering
in a direct numerical simulation of particle motion in a turbulent channel flow
is performed according to the presented theory. The strongest contribution to
clustering coming from the inhomogeneity of the flow occurs in the transitional
region between viscous sublayer and the buffer layer. Further the ratio of
homogeneous and inhomogeneous term depends on the wall distance. The
inhomogeneous terms may significantly increase the preferential concentration
of inertial particles, thus the overall degree of clustering in inhomogeneous
turbulence is potentially stronger compared to particles with the same inertia
in purely homogeneous turbulence.

virtual machine and may use one or more services to complete its task.
Although, scaling service independently from its required services propagates
scaling problem to other services, most of current elasticity approaches do not
consider functional dependencies between services, which increases the
probability of violating service level agreement. In this paper, architecture
of SaaS application is modeled as multi-class M/M/m processor sharing queuing
model with deadline to take into account functional dependencies between
services during estimating required scaling resources. Experimental results
show effectiveness of the proposed model in estimating required resources
during scaling virtual resources.

based on linear and ellipse regression techniques. After collecting all
possible forms of each character, unique code is generated to represent each

minimizing set has the property that the regret ratio between the score of the
top-1 item in Q and the score of the top-k item in P is minimized, where the
score of an item is the inner product of the item's attributes with a user's

  We show that k-regret minimization is NP-Complete for all dimensions d >= 3.
This settles an open problem from Chester et al. [VLDB 2014], and resolves the

extensive experimental evaluation, and show that our schemes compute

tuning the epsilon-near-zero frequency (plasma frequency) of the metal acting
as a thermal emitter to the electronic bandgap of the semiconducting cell. This
approach utilizes the change in reflectivity of a metal near its plasma
frequency (epsilon-near-zero frequency) to lead to spectrally selective thermal

near-surface energy density in graphene-multilayer thermal metamaterials due to
a topological transition at an effective epsilon-near-zero frequency. This

is very weak in usual solids, it is enhanced in Weyl semimetals, where the
Berry curvature contributes to observable nonlinear optical responses due to
its nodal structure. In this paper, using semiclassical Boltzmann theory, we
show that the d.c. photocurrent induced by the Berry curvature robustly

edges removal. Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose
failure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected
triples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important
because connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many
real-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable
data transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in
mobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can
greatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which
can further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such

sampling model, the sample complexity of testing properties of joint
distributions is exponential in the dimension, resulting in inefficient
algorithms for practical use. While recent results achieve efficient algorithms
for product distributions with significantly smaller sample complexity, no
efficient algorithm is expected when the marginals are not independent.
  We initialize the study of conditional sampling in the multidimensional
setting. We propose a subcube conditional sampling model where the tester can
condition on an (adaptively) chosen subcube of the domain. Due to its
simplicity, this model is potentially implementable in many practical
applications, particularly when the distribution is a joint distribution over
$\Sigma^n$ for some set $\Sigma$.
  We present algorithms for various fundamental properties of distributions in
the subcube-conditioning model and prove that the sample complexity is
polynomial in the dimension $n$ (and not exponential as in the traditional
model). We present an algorithm for testing identity to a known distribution
using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$-subcube-conditional samples, an algorithm for
testing identity between two unknown distributions using
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5)$-subcube-conditional samples and an algorithm for
testing identity to a product distribution using
$tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5)$-subcube-conditional samples.
  The central concept of our technique involves an elegant chain rule which can
be proved using basic techniques of probability theory yet powerful enough to
avoid the curse of dimensionality.

area. Using a non-iterative holomorphic embedding method (HEM) with a proposed
physical germ solution, an accurate loading limit at each load bus can be
calculated based on online state estimation on the entire load area and a
measurement-based equivalent for the external system. The HEM employs a power
series to calculate an accurate Power-Voltage (P-V) curve at each load bus and
accordingly evaluates the voltage stability margin considering load variations
in the next period. An adaptive two-stage Pade approximants method is proposed
to improve the convergence of the power series for accurate determination of
the nose point on the P-V curve with moderate computational burden. The
proposed method is illustrated in detail on a 4-bus test system and then
demonstrated on a load area of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC)
48-geneartor, 140-bus power system.

pressure force upon an anisotropic surface. The optical parameters of such a
surface are considered to have major and minor axes, so the model is called an
orthotropic model. We derive the equations for force components from emission,
absorption, and reflection, utilizing a modified Maxwell's specular-diffuse
model. The proposed model can be used to model a flat solar sail with wrinkles.
By performing Bayesian analysis for example of a wrinkled surface, we show that
there are cases in which an orthotropic model of the optical parameters of a
surface may be more accurate than an isotropic model.

the femtosecond time scale before transitioning between local minima after
nanoseconds or microseconds. This vast scale separation limits the
applicability of classical molecular dynamics methods and has spurned the
development of a host of approximate algorithms. One recently proposed method
is diffusive molecular dynamics which aims to integrate a system of ordinary
differential equations describing the likelihood of occupancy by one of two
species, in the case of a binary alloy, while quasistatically evolving the
locations of the atoms. While diffusive molecular dynamics has shown to be
efficient and provide agreement with observations, it is fundamentally a model,
with unclear connections to classical molecular dynamics.
  In this work, we formulate a spin-diffusion stochastic process and show how
it can be connected to diffusive molecular dynamics. The spin-diffusion model
couples a classical overdamped Langevin equation to a kinetic Monte Carlo model
for exchange amongst the species of a binary alloy. Under suitable assumptions
and approximations, spin-diffusion can be shown to lead to diffusive molecular
molecular dynamics type models. The key assumptions and approximations include
a well defined time scale separation, a choice of spin exchange rates, a low
temperature approximation, and a mean field type approximation. We derive
several models from different assumptions and show their relationship to
diffusive molecular dynamics. Differences and similarities amongst the models
are explored in a simple test problem.

experimentally observed at up to 98% desorption of the impinging gallium. We
found that, under the conditions of significant thermal desorption, larger
amounts of gallium were retained at lateral boundaries of 3D surface features
than at flat terraces because of the higher binding energy of Ga atoms at
specific surface defects. The selective accumulation of gallium resulted in an
increase in lateral growth component through the formation of the Ga-enriched
AlGaN phase at boundaries of 3D surface features. We studied temperature
dependence of AlGaN growth rate and developed a kinetic model analytically
describing this dependence. As the model was in good agreement with the
experimental data, we used it to estimate the increase in the binding energy of
Ga atoms at surface defects compared to terrace surface cites using data on the
Ga content in different AlGaN phases. We also applied first-principles
calculations to the thermodynamic analysis of stable configurations on the AlN
surface and then used these surface configurations to compare the binding
energy of Ga atom at terraces and steps. Both first-principles calculations and
analytical estimations of the experimental results gave similar values of
difference in binding energies; this value is 0.3 eV.

addresses major seams issues of CTS: the ad hoc use of proxy buses, the

in dealing with multiple interfaces. By allowing market participants to submit
bids across market boundaries, GCTS also generalizes the joint economic
dispatch that achieves seamless interchange without market participants. It is
shown that GCTS asymptotically achieves seamless interface under certain

interacting spins, this ""excitation"" would spread as consequence of spin-spin
interactions. Such an apparently irreversible process is known as spin
diffusion and it can lead the system back to ""equilibrium"". Even so, a unitary
quantum dynamics would ensure a precise memory of the non-equilibrium initial
condition. Then, if at certain time, say $t/2$, an experimental protocol
reverses the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial
non-equilibrium state at time $t$. As a matter of fact, the reversal is always
perturbed by small experimental imperfections and/or uncontrolled internal or
environmental degrees of freedom. This limits the amount of signal $M(t)$
recovered locally at time $t$. The degradation of $M(t)$ accounts for these
perturbations, which can also be seen as the sources of decoherence. This idea
defines the Loschmidt echo (LE), which embodies the various time-reversal
procedures implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance. Here, we present an
invitation to the study of the LE following the pathway induced by the
experiments. With such a purpose, we provide a historical and conceptual
overview that briefly revisits selected phenomena that underlie the LE
dynamics, ultimately leading to the discussion of irreversibility as an
emergent phenomenon. In addition, we introduce the LE formalism by means of
spin-spin correlation functions and we present new results that could trigger
new experiments and theoretical ideas. In particular, we propose to transform
an initially localized excitation into a more complex initial state, enabling a
dynamically prepared LE. This induces a global definition of the LE in terms of
the raw overlap between many-body wave functions. Our results show that as the
complexity of the prepared state increases, it becomes more fragile towards
small perturbations.

pseudo imaging, such as Compton Camera (CC) and coded mask. Pseudo imaging does
not keep physical information (intensity, or brightness in Optics) along a ray,
and thus is capable of no more than qualitative imaging of bright objects. To
attain quantitative imaging, cameras that realize geometrical optics is
essential, which would be, for nuclear MeV gammas, only possible via complete
reconstruction of the Compton process. Recently we have revealed that ""Electron
Tracking Compton Camera"" (ETCC) provides a well-defined Point Spread Function
(PSF). The information of an incoming gamma is kept along a ray with the PSF
and that is equivalent to geometrical optics. Here we present an
imaging-spectroscopic measurement with the ETCC. Our results highlight the
intrinsic difficulty with CCs in performing accurate imaging, and show that the
ETCC surmounts this problem. The imaging capability also helps the ETCC
suppress the noise level dramatically by ~3 orders of magnitude without a
shielding structure. Furthermore, full reconstruction of Compton process with
the ETCC provides spectra free of Compton edges. These results mark the first
proper imaging of nuclear gammas based on the genuine geometrical optics.

medium (the weakly-collisional magnetized inhomogeneous plasma permeating

the salt finger instability found in the oceans. The salt finger instability is
a form of double diffusive convection where the diffusions of two physical
quantities---heat and salt concentrations---occur with different diffusion
rates. The analogous instability in the intracluster medium may result owing to
the magnetic field mediated anisotropic diffusions of the heat and the Helium
ions (in the sea of the Hydrogen ions and the free electrons). These two
diffusions have inherently different diffusion rates. Hence the convection
caused by the onset of this instability is an example of double diffusive
convection in the astrophysical settings. A consequence of this instability is
the formation of the vertical filamentary structures having more concentration
of the Helium ions with respect to the immediate neighbourhoods of the
filaments. We term these structures as Helium fingers in analogy with the salt
fingers found in the case of the salt finger instability. Here we show that the
width of a Helium finger scales as one-fourth power of the radius of the inner
region of the intracluster medium in the supercritical regime. We also
determine the explicit mathematical expression of the criterion for the onset

cost-sensitive SVM method whose penalty parameter C optimized on the basis of
cluster probability density function(PDF) and the cluster PDF is estimated only

Experimental results on various standard benchmark data sets and real-world

nonzero positive cosmological constant $\lambda$. In this scenario the complex
structure moduli are still stabilized by the three-form fluxes as in the usual
flux compactifications, but the K$\ddot{\rm a}$hler modulus is not fixed by the
KKLT scenario. In our case the scale factor (or the K$\ddot{\rm a}$hler
modulus) of the internal dimensions is basically allowed to change with time.
But at the supergravity level it is fixed by a set of dynamical (plus
constraint) equations defined on the 4D spacetime, not by the nonperturbative
corrections of KKLT. Also at the supergravity level it is shown that $\lambda$
is fine-tuned to zero, $\lambda =0$, by the same set of 4D equations. This
result changes once we admit $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrections of the string
theory. The fine-tuning $\lambda=0$ changes into $\lambda = \frac{2}{3} Q$,
where $Q$ is a constant representing quantum corrections of the brane and 6D
action defined on the internal dimensions and its value is determined by the
$\alpha^{\prime}$-corrections. It is also shown that this nonzero $\lambda$
must be positive and at the same time the internal dimensions must evolve with
time almost at the same rate as the external dimensions in the case of nonzero
$\lambda$.

assimilation (downscaling) algorithm based on spatial coarse mesh measurements.
As a paradigm, we demonstrate the application of this algorithm to the 3D
Leray-$\alpha$ subgrid scale turbulence model. Most importantly, we use this
paradigm to show that it is not always necessary that one has to collect coarse
mesh measurements of all the state variables, that are involved in the
underlying evolutionary system, in order to recover the corresponding exact
reference solution. Specifically, we show that in the case of the 3D
Leray$-\alpha$ model of turbulence the solutions of the algorithm, constructed
using only coarse mesh observations of any two components of the
three-dimensional velocity field, and without any information of the third
component, converge, at an exponential rate in time, to the corresponding exact
reference solution of the 3D Leray$-\alpha$ model. This study serves as an
addendum to our recent work on abridged continuous data assimilation for the 2D
Navier-Stokes equations. Notably, similar results have also been recently
established for the 3D viscous Planetary Geostrophic circulation model in which
we show that coarse mesh measurements of the temperature alone are sufficient
for recovering, through our data assimilation algorithm, the full solution;
viz. the three components of velocity vector field and the temperature.
Consequently, this proves the Charney conjecture for the 3D Planetary
Geostrophic model; namely, that the history of the large spatial scales of
temperature is sufficient for determining all the other quantities (state
variables) of the model.

more generally $LG$ for compact simple simply-connected Lie groups $G$).
Baez-Crans-Stevenson-Schreiber constructed a model for the string 2-group using
a based loop group. This has the deficiency that it does not admit an action of
the circle group $S^1$, which is of crucial importance, for instance in the
construction of a (hypothetical) $S^1$-equivariant index of (higher)
differential operators. The present paper shows that there are in fact
obstructions for constructing a strict model for the string 2-group using $LG$.
We show that a certain infinite-dimensional manifold of smooth paths admits no
Lie group structure, and that there are no nontrivial Lie crossed modules
analogous to the BCSS model using the universal central extension of the free
loop group. Afterwards, we construct the next best thing, namely a coherent
model for the string 2-group using the free loop group, with explicit formulas
for all structure. This is in particular important for the expected
representation theory of the string group that we discuss briefly in the end.

deposited onto a two-dimensional square lattice of size $L\times L$ up to the
jamming concentration using a random sequential adsorption algorithm. The size
of the lattice, $L$, was varied from $128$ to $2048$, and periodic boundary
conditions were applied along both $x$ and $y$ axes, while the length of the
$k$-mers (determining the aspect ratio) was varied from $2$ to $12$. The
$k$-mers oriented along the $x$ and $y$ directions ($k_x$-mers and $k_y$-mers,
respectively) were deposited equiprobably. In the course of the simulation, the
numbers of intraspecific and interspecific contacts between the same sort and
between different sorts of $k$-mers, respectively, were calculated. Both the
shift ratio of the actual number of shifts along the longitudinal or transverse
axes of the $k$-mers and the electrical conductivity of the system were also
examined. For the initial random configuration, quite different
self-organization behavior was observed for short and long $k$-mers. For long
$k$-mers ($k\geq 6$), three main stages of diffusion-driven spatial segregation
(self-assembly) were identified: the initial stage, reflecting destruction of
the jamming state, the intermediate stage, reflecting continuous cluster
coarsening and labyrinth pattern formation and the final stage, reflecting the
formation of diagonal stripe domains. Additional examination of two
artificially constructed initial configurations showed that this pattern of
diagonal stripe domains is an attractor, i.e., any spatial distribution of
$k$-mers tends to transform into diagonal stripes. Nevertheless, the time for
relaxation to the steady state essentially increases as the lattice size
growth.

`big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in
biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs
to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model
parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In
this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related
problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given
observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review
applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of
neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene
regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of
controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the
statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method,
pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising
problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be
reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.

  Pathfinding Using Hierarchical Taut Paths",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Any-Angle Pathfinding problem, the goal is to find the shortest path
between a pair of vertices on a uniform square grid, that is not constrained to
any fixed number of possible directions over the grid. Visibility Graphs are a
known optimal algorithm for solving the problem with the use of pre-processing.
However, Visibility Graphs are known to perform poorly in terms of running
time, especially on large, complex maps. In this paper, we introduce two
improvements over the Visibility Graph Algorithm to compute optimal paths.
Sparse Visibility Graphs (SVGs) are constructed by pruning unnecessary edges
from the original Visibility Graph. Edge N-Level Sparse Visibility Graphs
(ENLSVGs) is a hierarchical SVG built by iteratively pruning non-taut paths. We
also introduce Line-of-Sight Scans, a faster algorithm for building Visibility
Graphs over a grid. SVGs run much faster than Visibility Graphs by reducing the
average vertex degree. ENLSVGs, a hierarchical algorithm, improves this
further, especially on larger maps. On large maps, with the use of
pre-processing, these algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than existing
algorithms like Visibility Graphs and Theta*.

chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) in the natural SUSY-type sfermion mass
spectrum, in which stop mass $m_{\tilde t}$ is much smaller than the other
sfermion masses $m_0$. The natural SUSY-type sfermion mass spectrum has been
studied since the supersymmetric (SUSY) flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC)
are suppressed because of large sfermion masses of the first two generations,
and the weak scale is stabilized because of the light stop. However, this type
of sfermion mass spectrum is severely constrained by CEDM, because the light
stop contributions to the up quark CEDM are not decoupled in the limit
$m_0\rightarrow\infty$, while the down quark CEDM is decoupled in the limit. It
is important that the constraints are severe even if SUSY-breaking parameters
(and Higgsino mass) are taken to be real because complex diagonalizing matrices
of Yukawa matrices, which are from complex Yukawa couplings, generate
nonvanishing CP phases in off-diagonal elements of sfermion mass matrices. We
calculate the CEDM of up and down quarks numerically in the minimal SUSY
standard model, and give the lower bounds for stop mass and the other sfermion
masses. We show that the lower bound of stop mass becomes 7 TeV to satisfy the
CEDM constraints from Hg EDM. The result is not acceptable if the weak scale
stability is considered seriously. We show that if the up-type Yukawa couplings
are taken to be real at the grand unification scale, the CEDM constraints are
satisfied even if $m_{\tilde t}\sim 1$ TeV.

ablation driven pressure pulse. Here we study the resulting droplet deformation
in the regime where the ablation pressure duration is short, i.e. comparable to
the time scale on which pressure waves travel through the droplet. To this end
an acoustic analytic model for the pressure-, pressure impulse- and velocity
fields inside the droplet is developed in the limit of small density
fluctuations. This model is used to examine how the droplet deformation depends
on the pressure pulse duration while the total momentum to the droplet is kept
constant. Within the limits of this analytic model, we demonstrate that when
the total momentum transferred to the droplet is small the droplet
shape-evolution is indistinguishable from an incompressible droplet
deformation. However, when the momentum transfer is increased the droplet
response is strongly affected by the pulse duration. In this later regime,
compressed flow regimes alter the droplet shape evolution considerably.

terms of chemical abundances. Due to its low and homogeneous interstellar
absorption it is considered as a calibration field for Galactic bulge studies.
In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, calibration fields such as BW are
necessary to cross calibrate the stellar parameters and individual abundances
of the APOGEE survey. We use the APOGEE BW stars to derive their metallicity
distribution function (MDF) and individual abundances, for $\alpha$- and
iron-peak elements of the APOGEE ASPCAP pipeline (DR13), as well as the age
distribution for stars in BW. We determine the MDF of APOGEE stars in BW and
find a remarkable agreement with that of the Gaia-ESO survey (GES). Both
exhibit a clear bimodal distribution. We also find that the Mg-metallicity
planes of both surveys agree well, except for the metal-rich part ([Fe/H]
>0.1), where APOGEE finds systematically higher Mg abundances with respect to
the GES. The ages based on the [C/N] ratio reveal a bimodal age distribution,
with a major old population at 10 Gyr, with a decreasing tail towards younger
stars. A comparison between APOGEE estimates and stellar parameters, and those
determined by other sources reveals detectable systematic offsets, in
particular for spectroscopic surface gravity estimates. In general, we find a
good agreement between individual abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr,
Mn, Co, and Ni from APOGEE with that of literature values. We have shown that
in general APOGEE data show a good agreement in terms of MDF and individual
chemical abundances with respect to literature works. Using the [C/N] ration we
found a significant fraction of young stars in BW which is in agreement with
the model of Haywood et al. (2016).

  Method for Fracturing of Porous Media",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulation of fracturing processes in porous rocks can be divided into two
main branches: (i) modeling the rock as a continuum which is enhanced with
special features to account for fractures, or (ii) modeling the rock by a
discrete (or discontinuous) approach that describes the material directly as a
collection of separate blocks or particles, e.g., as in the discrete element
method (DEM). In the modified discrete element (MDEM) method, the effective
forces between virtual particles are modified in all regions, without failing
elements, so that they reproduce the discretization of a first order finite
element method (FEM) for linear elasticity. This provides an expression of the
virtual forces in terms of general Hook's macro-parameters. Previously, MDEM
has been formulated through an analogy with linear elements for FEM. We show
the connection between MDEM and the virtual element method (VEM), which is a
generalization of FEM to polyhedral grids. Unlike standard FEM, which computes
strain-states in a reference space, MDEM and VEM compute stress-states directly
in real space. This connection leads us to a new derivation of the MDEM method.
Moreover, it gives the basis for coupling (M)DEM to domain with linear
elasticity described by polyhedral grids, which makes it easier to apply
realistic boundary conditions in hydraulic-fracturing simulations. This
approach also makes it possible to combine fine-scale (M)DEM behavior near the
fracturing region with linear elasticity on complex reservoir grids in the
far-field region without regridding. To demonstrate the simulation of hydraulic
fracturing, the coupled (M)DEM-VEM method is implemented using the Matlab
Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) and linked to an industry-standard
reservoir simulator.

hot atoms are individually cooled by the cavity friction forces. After this

the coupling with the collective dipole. We analyse this asymptotic regime by

young stellar objects. We illustrate the formation of such radial structures
through idealized, 2D (axisymmetric) resistive MHD simulations of coupled
disk-wind systems threaded by a relatively weak poloidal magnetic field
(plasma-$\beta \sim 10^3$). We find two distinct modes of accretion depending
on the resistivity and field strength. A small resistivity or high field
strength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion
streams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of
the system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in
simulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of
the accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the
disk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by
the pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both
wind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent
features in the surface density distribution of the disk, including rings and
gaps, with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the
mass. Regions with low mass-to-flux ratios accrete quickly, leading to the
development of gaps, whereas regions with higher mass-to-flux ratios tend to
accrete more slowly, allowing matter to accumulate and form dense rings. In
some cases, avalanche accretion streams are observed to produce dense rings
directly through continuous feeding. We discuss the implications of ring and
gap formation driven by winds and streams on grain growth and planet formation.

(MSSS) of a giant radio galaxy (GRG) with a projected size of $2.56 \pm 0.07$
Mpc projected on the sky. It is associated with the galaxy triplet UGC 9555,
within which one is identified as a broad-line galaxy in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) at a redshift of $0.05453 \pm 1 \times 10^{-5} $, and with a
velocity dispersion of $215.86 \pm 6.34$ km/s. From archival radio observations
we see that this galaxy hosts a compact flat-spectrum radio source, and we
conclude that it is the active galactic nucleus (AGN) responsible for
generating the radio lobes. The radio luminosity distribution of the jets, and
the broad-line classification of the host AGN, indicate this GRG is orientated
well out of the plane of the sky, making its physical size one of the largest
known for any GRG. Analysis of the infrared data suggests that the host is a
lenticular type galaxy with a large stellar mass
($\log~\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{M}_\odot = 11.56 \pm 0.12$), and a moderate star
formation rate ($1.2 \pm 0.3~\mathrm{M}_\odot/\mathrm{year}$). Spatially
smoothing the SDSS images shows the system around UGC 9555 to be significantly
disturbed, with a prominent extension to the south-east. Overall, the evidence
suggests this host galaxy has undergone one or more recent moderate merger
events and is also experiencing tidal interactions with surrounding galaxies,
which have caused the star formation and provided the supply of gas to trigger
and fuel the Mpc-scale radio lobes.

reorganizing their cell-cell junctions and migrating directionally towards the

understood. To address this we first analyzed the collective response of
epithelial monolayers to injury and compare the results with different
computational models of epithelial cells. We found that a model that integrates
the mechanics of cells at the cell-cell and cell-substrate interface as well as
contact inhibition of locomotion predicts two key properties of epithelial
response to injury as: 1) local relaxation of the tissue and 2) collective
responses involving the elongation of cells (basal and apical regions) and
extension of cryptic lamellipodia that extend up to < 3 cell diameters from the

junctional biomechanics, cell substrate adhesion and contact inhibition of
locomotion to guide the rapid collective rearrangements that are required to
preserve the epithelial barrier in response to injury.

social influence, which results in either poor seed qualities or long

novel IM query named Stream Influence Maximization (SIM) on social streams.
Technically, SIM adopts the sliding window model and maintains a set of $k$

Next, we propose the Influential Checkpoints (IC) framework to facilitate
continuous SIM query processing. The IC framework creates a checkpoint for each
window slide and ensures an $\varepsilon$-approximate solution. To improve its
efficiency, we further devise a Sparse Influential Checkpoints (SIC) framework
which selectively keeps $O(\frac{\log{N}}{\beta})$ checkpoints for a sliding
window of size $N$ and maintains an
$\frac{\varepsilon(1-\beta)}{2}$-approximate solution. Experimental results on
both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency

within multivariate systems is a difficult open problem. Recently, the Partial
Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information
(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and
synergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose
to apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in
a Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy
redundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition
which is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can
reveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that
are indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective
also shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself
includes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships
between the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative
information decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This
reveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset
of the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in
part why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows
separate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of
the system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between
inputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The
new perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties
encountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide
useful tools for practical data analysis across a wide range of application
areas.

is by fitting theoretical isochrones on color-magnitude (alternatively
luminosity-temperature) diagrams. Since young stellar objects exhibit
photometric variability over wide range in magnitude and colors, the age and
mass determined by fitting isochrones is expected to be inaccurate, if not
erroneous. These in turn will badly affect any study carried out on age spread
and process of star formation. Since we have carried out very extensive
photometric observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), we decided to use
our multi-band data to explore the influence of variability in determining mass
and age of cluster members. In this study, we get the amplitudes of the
photometric variability in V, R, and I optical bands of a sample of 346 ONC
members and use it to investigate how the variability affects the inferred
masses and ages and if it alone can take account for the age spread among the
ONC members reported by earlier studies. We find that members that show
periodic and smooth photometric rotational modulation have their masses and
ages unaffected by variability. On other hand, we found that members with
periodic but very scattered photometric rotational modulation and members with
irregular variability have their masses and ages significantly affected.
Moreover, using Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams we find that the observed I
band photometric variability can take account of only a fraction (about 50%) of
the inferred age spread, whereas the V band photometric variability is large
enough to mask any age spread.

last years. In order to gain a complete understanding of the rheological
properties of these novel materials, it is necessary the study in a large
deformations regime to alter their internal structure. In this sense, Schmoller
et al. 2010 showed that the reconstituted networks of F-actin crosslinked with
$\alpha$-actinin unexpectedly harden when they are subjected to a cyclical
shear. This observation contradicts the expected Mullins effect observed in
most soft materials, such as rubber and living tissues, where a pronounced
softening is observed when they are cyclically deformed.
  We think that the key to understand this stunning effect is the gelation
process. To define it, the most relevant constituents are the chemical
crosslinks -$\alpha$-actinin-, the physical crosslinks -introduced by the
entanglement of the semiflexible network- and the interaction between them. As
a consequence of this interaction, a pre-stressed network emerges and
introduces a feedback effect, where the pre-stress also regulates the adhesion
energy of the $\alpha$-actinin, setting the structure in a metastable reference
configuration. Therefore, the external loads and the evolvement of the trapped
stress drive the microstructural changes during the cyclic loading protocol. In
this work, we propose a micromechanical model into the framework of nonlinear
continuum mechanics. The mechanics of the F-actin filaments is modeled using
the wormlike chain model for semiflexible filaments and the gelation process is
modeled as mesoscale dynamics for the $\alpha$-actinin and physical
crosslink.The model has been validated with reported experimental results.

  Translation to Constraint Handling Rules",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computational psychology has the aim to explain human cognition by
computational models of cognitive processes. The cognitive architecture ACT-R
is popular to develop such models. Although ACT-R has a well-defined
psychological theory and has been used to explain many cognitive processes,
there are two problems that make it hard to reason formally about its cognitive
models: First, ACT-R lacks a formalization of its underlying production rule
system and secondly, there are many different implementations and extensions of
ACT-R with technical artifacts complicating formal reasoning even more.
  This paper describes a formal operational semantics - the very abstract
semantics - that abstracts from as many technical details as possible keeping
it open to extensions and different implementations of the ACT-R theory. In a
second step, this semantics is refined to define some of its abstract features
that are found in many implementations of ACT-R - the abstract semantics. It
concentrates on the procedural core of ACT-R and is suitable for analysis of
the transition system since it still abstracts from details like timing, the
sub-symbolic layer or conflict resolution.
  Furthermore, a translation of ACT-R models to the programming language
Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is defined. This makes the abstract semantics
an executable specification of ACT-R. CHR has been used successfully to embed
other rule-based formalisms like graph transformation systems or functional
programming. There are many results and tools that support formal reasoning
about and analysis of CHR programs. The translation of ACT-R models to CHR is
proven sound and complete w.r.t. the abstract operational semantics of ACT-R.
This paves the way to analysis of ACT-R models through CHR. Therefore, to the
best of our knowledge, our abstract semantics is the first formulation of ACT-R
suitable for both analysis and execution.

of the quantum system (the quantum Zeno effect) but also accelerate the time
evolution of the system (the quantum anti-Zeno effect). In studies of the
quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects, a quantum state, usually an excited state
of the system, is prepared repeatedly by projecting the quantum state onto the
initial state again and again. In this paper, we repeatedly prepare the initial
quantum state in a different manner. Instead of only performing projective
measurements, we allow unitary operations to be performed, on a very short
time-scale, after each measurement. We can then repeatedly prepare the initial
quantum state by performing some projective measurement and thereafter, after
each measurement, performing a suitable unitary operation to repeatedly end up
with the initial state. Our objective thereafter is to find the projective
measurements that need to repeatedly performed such that we obtain the minimum
possible effective decay rate of the quantum state. Consequently, the quantum
state is maximally protected from its environment. We find that these optimized
projective measurements keep on changing depending on the measurement time
interval. We explicitly find the projective measurements that need to be
performed, as well as the optimized effective decay rate, for a variety of
system-environment models such as the population decay model, the pure
dephasing model, the spin-boson model, and the large spin-boson model. We find
that there can be considerable differences between this optimized effective
decay rate and the usual decay rate obtained by repeatedly projecting onto the
initial state. In particular, the Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes can be
considerably modified.

from the measured density of states, (b) the gauge-invariant evaluation of the
current-current response function, needed to account for the optical absorption
by SC collective modes, and (c) the inclusion into the MB formula of the energy

optical conductvity in the disordered attractive Hubbard model we analyze the
relevance of all these items, and we provide a compelling scheme for the
analysis and interpretation of the optical data in real materials.

fusion machine often assume that power flows only along the field lines, but
this cannot be true in general. Instead, we treat the plasma as an anisotropic
non-linear thermally conducting medium. The model is physically relevant if
parallel and cross-field transport are driven at least in part by temperature
gradients, which means they are affected by the proximity of material surfaces.
The model generates a familiar asymmetrical power distribution on the divertor
target, and divergent heat flux on sharp edges, as described previously. The
power landing on a wall that is parallel to the field (identically zero in the
conventional model) is a substantial fraction of that landing on the target.
The flux profile across the scrape-off layer (SOL) deviates strongly from an
exponential, because the parallel heat conduction is very large near the
separatrix, giving a much steeper fall-off in that region. When a portion of
the wall protrudes into the SOL at a grazing angle, the power striking the
inclined surface is several times the value derived by integrating the parallel
heat flux calculated in the absence of the inclined surface. We have also
calculated the degree to which the shadowing effect of a first wall component
on other parts of the wall falls off with distance - something that cannot even
be estimated using the field-line following technique.

possibilities for systematic representation of uncertainty using probability

challenging problems. Some problems of this type that were previously
intractable can now be solved on standard personal computers thanks to recent
advances in Monte Carlo methods. In particular, for learning of unknown
parameters in nonlinear state-space models, methods based on the particle
filter (a Monte Carlo method) have proven very useful. A notoriously
challenging problem, however, still occurs when the observations in the
state-space model are highly informative, i.e. when there is very little or no
measurement noise present, relative to the amount of process noise. The
particle filter will then struggle in estimating one of the basic components
for probabilistic learning, namely the likelihood $p($data$|$parameters$)$. To
this end we suggest an algorithm which initially assumes that there is
substantial amount of artificial measurement noise present. The variance of
this noise is sequentially decreased in an adaptive fashion such that we, in

we probe different phases of disordered systems by studying the time

with actual information needs. They are subject to measurement errors relating
to observation, aggregation, attribution, and various sources of heterogeneity.
More precise indicators such as size estimates are costly to measure at
Internet scale. We address these issues for the case of hosting providers with
a statistical model of the abuse data generation process, using phishing sites
in hosting networks as a case study. We decompose error sources and then
estimate key parameters of the model, controlling for heterogeneity in size and
business model. We find that 84\,\% of the variation in abuse counts across
45,358 hosting providers can be explained with structural factors alone.
Informed by the fitted model, we systematically select and enrich a subset of
105 homogeneous ""statistical twins"" with additional explanatory variables,
unreasonable to collect for \emph{all} hosting providers. We find that abuse is
positively associated with the popularity of websites hosted and with the
prevalence of popular content management systems. Moreover, hosting providers
who charge higher prices (after controlling for level differences between
countries) witness less abuse. These factors together explain a further 77\,\%
of the remaining variation, calling into question premature inferences from raw
abuse indicators on security efforts of actors, and suggesting the adoption of
similar analysis frameworks in all domains where network measurement aims at

Josephson junctions in the framework of the resistively and capacitively
shunted model. We use the non-sinusoidal current-phase relation specific for
graphene layers partially covered by superconducting electrodes. The noise
induced escapes from the metastable states, when the external bias current is
ramped, give the switching current distribution, i.e. the probability
distribution of the passages to finite voltage from the superconducting state
as a function of the bias current, that is the information more promptly
available in the experiments. We consider a noise source that is a mixture of
two different types of processes: a Gaussian contribution to simulate an
uncorrelated ordinary thermal bath, and non-Gaussian, $\alpha$-stable (or
L\'evy) term, generally associated to non-equilibrium transport phenomena. We
find that the analysis of the switching current distribution makes it possible
to efficiently detect a non-Gaussian noise component in a Gaussian background.

At the same time there are numerical evidences that the bar instability can
form a bar. We analyse this discrepancy, by accurate and diverse N-body
simulations and using the calculation of normal modes. We show that bar
formation in cuspy galaxies can be explained by taking into account the disc
thickness. The exponential growth time is moderate for typical current disc
masses (about 250 Myr), but considerably increases (factor 2 or more) upon
substitution of the live halo and bulge with a rigid halo/bulge potential;
meanwhile pattern speeds remain almost the same. Normal mode analysis with
different disc mass favours a young bar hypothesis, according to which the bar

features most likely originate from plage, spots, or a combination of both.
They also display radial velocity variations of $\sim$300 m s$^{-1}$ -

Furthermore, we see evidence that some of the lines originating from the

life of low-powered devices, reduce the carbon footprint, and make the system
self-sustainable. Most research to date have focused either on the physical
aspects of energy conversion process or on optimal consumption policy of the
harvested energy at the system level. However, although intuitively understood,
to the best of our knowledge, the idea of self-sustainability is yet to be made
precise and studied as a performance metric. In this paper, we provide a
mathematical definition of the concept of self-sustainability of an energy
harvesting system, based on the complementary idea of eventual outage. In
particular, we analyze the harvest-store-consume system with infinite battery
capacity, stochastic energy arrivals, and fixed energy consumption rate. Using
the random walk theory, we identify the necessary condition for the system to
be self-sustainable. General formulas are given for the self-sustainability
probability in the form of integral equations. Since these integral equations
are difficult to solve analytically, an exponential upper bound for eventual
outage probability is given using martingales. This bound guarantees that the
eventual outage probability can be made arbitrarily small simply by increasing
the initial battery energy. We also give an asymptotic formula for eventual
outage. For the special case when the energy arrival follows a Poisson process,
we are able to find the exact formulas for the eventual outage probability. We
also show that the harvest-store-consume system is mathematically equivalent to
a $GI/G/1$ queueing system, which allows us to easily find the outage
probability, in case the necessary condition for self-sustainability is
violated. Monte-Carlo simulations verify our analysis.

the scaling argument for droplets of 90 degrees, that shows itself in the
velocities. We show that droplets with a contact angle below 90 degrees exhibit
a self-similar velocity field, and the corresponding scaling laws are
identified. For drops of 90 degrees, however, it is shown that the velocity
field has a more intricate structure that is beyond the usual scaling arguments
invoked for coalescence.

distributions: $p$ observed from samples and the baseline distribution $q$
known \emph{a priori}. Extending the results of Acharya et al. (SODA'15) on
estimating Renyi entropy, we present improved estimation techniques together
with upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity.
  We show that, contrarily to estimating Renyi entropy where a sublinear (in
the alphabet size) number of samples suffices, the sample complexity is heavily
dependent on \emph{events occurring unlikely} in $q$, and is unbounded in
general (no matter what an estimation technique is used). For any divergence of
order bigger than $1$, we provide upper and lower bounds on the number of
samples dependent on probabilities of $p$ and $q$. We conclude that the
worst-case sample complexity is polynomial in the alphabet size if and only if
the probabilities of $q$ are non-negligible.
  This gives theoretical insights into heuristics used in applied papers to
handle numerical instability, which occurs for small probabilities of $q$. Our
result explains that small probabilities should be handled with care not only
because of numerical issues, but also because of a blow up in sample
complexity.

We combine these with precise determinations of the corotation radii associated
with the bars, taken from our previous study which used the phase change from
radial inflow to radial outflow of gas at corotation, based on high resolution
two-dimensional velocity fields in H{\alpha} taken with a Fabry-P\'erot
spectrometer. After presenting the histograms of the derived bar parameters, we
study their dependence on the galaxy morphological type and on the total
stellar mass of the host galaxy, and then produce a set of parametric plots.
These include the bar pattern speed versus bar length, the pattern speed
normalized with the characteristic pattern speed of the outer disk versus the
bar strength, and the normalized pattern speed versus R, the ratio of
corotation radius to bar length. To provide guide-lines for our interpretation
we used a recently published simulations, including disk and dark matter halo
components. Our most striking conclusion is that bars with values of R < 1.4,
previously considered dynamically fast rotators, can be among the slowest
rotators both in absolute terms and when their pattern speeds are normalized.
The simulations confirm that this is because as the bars are braked they can
grow longer more quickly than the outward drift of the corotation radius. We
conclude that dark matter halos have indeed slowed down the rotation of bars on
Gyr timescales.

The top-site adsorptions can induce the significantly buckled structures,
especially for hydrogen and fluorine adatoms. The electronic structures consist
of the carbon-, adatom- and (carbon, adatom)-dominated energy bands. There
exist the linear, parabolic, partially flat, sombrero-shaped and oscillatory

semiconducting behaviors of graphene systems are dramatically changed by the
multi- or single-orbital chemical bondings between carbons and adatoms.
Graphene oxides and hydrogenated graphenes possess the tunable energy gaps.
Fluorinated graphenes might be semiconductors or hole-doped metals, while other
halogenated systems belong to the latter. Alkali- and Al-doped graphenes
exhibit the high-density free electrons in the preserved Dirac cones. The
ferromagnetic spin configuration is revealed in hydrogenated and halogenated
graphenes under certain distributions. Specifically, Bi nano-structures are
formed by the interactions between monolayer graphene and buffer layer.

paper, we propose TensorBeat, a system to employ channel state information

multiple persons with commodity WiFi devices. The main idea is to leverage the
tensor decomposition technique to handle the CSI phase difference data. The
proposed TensorBeat scheme first obtains CSI phase difference data between
pairs of antennas at the WiFi receiver to create CSI tensor data. Then
Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition is applied to obtain the desired
breathing signals. A stable signal matching algorithm is developed to find the
decomposed signal pairs, and a peak detection method is applied to estimate the
breathing rates for multiple persons. Our experimental study shows that
TensorBeat can achieve high accuracy under different environments for
multi-person breathing rate monitoring.

  equations with periodic spatial boundary conditions","A bibliographical reference has been corrected, and a typo eliminated",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this monograph is to prove that any solution of the Cauchy
problem for the capillarity-gravity water waves equations, in one space
dimension, with periodic, even in space, initial data of small size $\epsilon$,
is almost globally defined in time on Sobolev spaces, i.e. it exists on a time
interval of length of magnitude $\epsilon^{-N}$ for any $N$, as soon as the
initial data are smooth enough, and the gravity-capillarity parameters are
taken outside an exceptional subset of zero measure. In contrast to the many
results known for these equations on the real line, with decaying Cauchy data,
one cannot make use of dispersive properties of the linear flow. Instead, our
method is based on a normal forms procedure, in order to eliminate those
contributions to the Sobolev energy that are of lower degree of homogeneity in
the solution. Since the water waves equations are a quasi-linear system, usual
normal forms approaches would face the well known problem of losses of
derivatives in the unbounded transformations. In this monograph, to overcome
such a difficulty, after a paralinearization of the capillarity-gravity water
waves equations, necessary to obtain energy estimates, and thus local existence
of the solutions, we first perform several paradifferential reductions of the
equations to obtain a diagonal system with constant coefficients symbols, up to
smoothing remainders. Then we may start with a normal form procedure where the
small divisors are compensated by the previous paradifferential
regularization.The reversible structure of the water waves equations, and the
fact that we look for solutions even in $x$, guarantees a key cancellation
which prevents the growth of the Sobolev norms of the solutions.

network heated by a gas fired CHP. In most common situations, such a CHP is
heat driven operated, meaning that the CHP will switch on whenever heat is
needed, while not taking into account the demand of electricity at that time.
In this paper however, an active control strategy is developed, aiming to
maximize the profit of the CHP, selling its electricity to the spot market. The
CHP will therefore switch on at moments of high electricity prices.
Nevertheless, since there never is a perfect match between the demand of heat
and the demand of electricity, a thermal energy storage is included in the
network to overcome the difference between supply and demand of heat in the
network. In this study, three different storage concepts are compared: (1) a
central buffer tank next to the CHP; (2) small storage vessels distributed over
the different connected buildings; and (3) the use of the thermal mass if the
buildings as storage capacity. Besides the development of the control
algorithms based on model predictive control, a simulation model of the network
is described to evaluate the performance of the different storage concept
during a representative winter week. The results show that the presented
control algorithm can significantly influence the heat demand profile of the
connected buildings. As a results, active control of the CHP can drastically
increase the profit of the CHP. The concept with the distributed buffers gives
the best results, however the profit for the thermal mass concept is only
marginally smaller. Since in this latter case no significant investment costs
are needed, the conclusion for this case study is that the use of thermal mass
of buildings for demand side management in district heating systems is very
promising.

and rolling-- that involve contacts between a gripper, a rigid object, and
their environment. The evaluation is done through thousands of controlled
experiments designed to capture the motion of object and gripper, and all
contact forces and torques at 250Hz. We demonstrate that a contact modeling
approach based on Coulomb's friction law and maximum energy principle is
effective at reasoning about interaction to first order, but limited for making
accurate predictions. We attribute the major limitations to 1) the
non-uniqueness of force resolution inherent to grasps with multiple hard
contacts of complex geometries, 2) unmodeled dynamics due to contact
compliance, and 3) unmodeled geometries dueto manufacturing defects.

focusing on multilayer hyperbolic meta-materials. We discuss the formation of
the hyperbolic bands, the impact of ordering of the multilayer slabs, as well
as the impact of the first single layer on the heat transfer. Furthermore, we
compare the contribution of surface modes to that of hyperbolic modes. Finally,
we also compare the exact results with predictions from effective medium
theory.

solution for many real-world applications. However, its modus operandi is not
ideally suited to resource-constrained environments that are characterized by
limited network bandwidth and high latencies. With the increasing proliferation
and sophistication of edge devices, the idea of fog computing proposes to
offload some of the computation to the edge. To this end, micro-clouds---which
are modular and portable assemblies of small single-board computers---have
started to gain attention as infrastructures to support fog computing by
offering isolated resource provisioning at the edge in a cost-effective way. We
investigate the feasibility and readiness of micro-clouds for delivering the
vision of fog computing. Through a number of experiments, we showcase the
potential of micro-clouds formed by collections of Raspberry Pi computers to
host a range of fog-related applications, particularly for locations where
there is limited network bandwidths and long latencies.
