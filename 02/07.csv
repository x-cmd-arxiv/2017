  Massive Arrays: MIMO vs. Beamforming",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next generation cellular networks will experience the combination of
femtocells, millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications and massive antenna
arrays. Thanks to the beamforming capability as well as the high angular
resolution provided by massive arrays, only one single access point (AP) acting
as an anchor node could be used for localization estimation, thus avoiding
over-sized infrastructures dedicated to positioning. In this context, our paper
aims at investigating the localization and orientation performance limits
employing massive arrays both at the AP and mobile side. Thus, we first
asymptotically demonstrate the tightness of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) in
massive array regime, and in the presence or not of multipath. Successively, we
propose a comparison between MIMO and beamforming in terms of array structure,
time synchronization error and multipath components. Among different array
configurations, we consider also random weighting as a trade-off between the
high diversity gain of MIMO and the high directivity guaranteed by phased
arrays. By evaluating the CRB for the different array configurations, results
show the interplay between diversity and beamforming gain as well as the
benefits achievable by varying the number of array elements in terms of
localization accuracy.

direct evidence that $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ exhibits a magnetic field-induced QSL.
For fields larger than $\sim 10$ T a spin-gap opens up while resonance lines
remain sharp, evidencing that spins are quantum disordered and locally
fluctuating. The spin gap increases linearly with increasing magnetic field,
reaching $\sim50$ K at 15 T, and is nearly isotropic with respect to the field
direction. The unusual rapid increase of the spin gap with increasing field and
its isotropic nature are incompatible with conventional magnetic ordering and
in particular exclude that the ground state is a fully polarized ferromagnet.
The presence of such a field-induced, gapped QSL phase has indeed been
predicted in the Kitaev model.

  response to referee comments",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The `full' edge isoperimetric inequality for the discrete cube (due to
Harper, Bernstein, Lindsay and Hart) specifies the minimum size of the edge
boundary $\partial A$ of a set $A \subset \{0,1\}^n$, as a function of $|A|$. A
weaker (but more widely-used) lower bound is $|\partial A| \geq |A|
\log_2(2^n/|A|)$, where equality holds iff $A$ is a subcube. In 2011, the first
author obtained a sharp `stability' version of the latter result, proving that
if $|\partial A| \leq |A| (\log(2^n/|A|)+\epsilon)$, then there exists a
subcube $C$ such that $|A \Delta C|/|A| = O(\epsilon /\log(1/\epsilon))$.
  The `weak' version of the edge isoperimetric inequality has the following
well-known generalization for the `$p$-biased' measure $\mu_p$ on the discrete
cube: if $p \leq 1/2$, or if $0 < p < 1$ and $A$ is monotone increasing, then
$p\mu_p(\partial A) \geq \mu_p(A) \log_p(\mu_p(A))$.
  In this paper, we prove a sharp stability version of the latter result, which
generalizes the aforementioned result of the first author. Namely, we prove
that if $p\mu_p(\partial A) \leq \mu_p(A) (\log_p(\mu_p(A))+\epsilon)$, then
there exists a subcube $C$ such that $\mu_p(A \Delta C)/\mu_p(A) = O(\epsilon'
/\log(1/\epsilon'))$, where $\epsilon' =\epsilon \ln (1/p)$. This result is a
central component in recent work of the authors proving sharp stability
versions of a number of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems in extremal
combinatorics, including the seminal `complete intersection theorem' of
Ahlswede and Khachatrian.
  In addition, we prove a biased-measure analogue of the `full' edge
isoperimetric inequality, for monotone increasing sets, and we observe that
such an analogue does not hold for arbitrary sets, hence answering a question
of Kalai. We use this result to give a new proof of the `full' edge
isoperimetric inequality, one relying on the Kruskal-Katona theorem.

bias. As this may impair performance, social and economic settings need to be
adapted accordingly. Common tools to reduce the impact of time-inconsistent
behavior are penalties and prohibition. Such tools are called commitment
devices. In recent work Kleinberg and Oren connect the design of
prohibition-based commitment devices to a combinatorial problem in which edges
are removed from a task graph $G$ with $n$ nodes. However, this problem is
NP-hard to approximate within a ratio less than $\sqrt{n}/3$. To address this
issue, we propose a penalty-based commitment device that does not delete edges
but raises their cost. The benefits of our approach are twofold. On the
conceptual side, we show that penalties are up to $1/\beta$ times more
efficient than prohibition, where $\beta \in (0,1]$ parameterizes the present
bias. On the computational side, we significantly improve approximability by
presenting a $2$-approximation algorithm for allocating the penalties. To
complement this result, we prove that optimal penalties are NP-hard to
approximate within a ratio of $1.08192$.

idea to decouple the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) association has recently
been shown to provide significant gain in terms of both coverage and rate
performance. However, all the work is limited to SISO network. Therefore, to
study the gain provided by the DL and UL decoupling in multi-antenna base

ratio combining (MRC) as a linear receiver at the BSs and using tools from
stochastic geometry, we derive tractable expressions for both signal to
interference ratio (SIR) coverage probability and rate coverage probability. We
observe that as the disparity in the beamforming gain of both tiers increases,
the gain in term of SIR coverage probability provided by the decoupled
association over non-decoupled association decreases. We further observe that
when there is asymmetry in the number of antennas of both tier, then we need
further biasing towards femto-tier on the top of decoupled association to
balance the load and get optimal rate coverage probability.

from the same quantum state. Each pair forms a combined-probability vector that
obeys certain quantum constraints, which are triangle inequalities in our case.
Such a restricted set of combined vectors, titled combined-probability space,
is presented here for a $d$-level quantum system (qudit). The combined space
turns out a compact convex subset of a Euclidean space, and all its extreme
points come from a family of parametric curves. Considering a suitable concave
function on the combined space to estimate the uncertainty, we deliver an
uncertainty relation by finding its global minimum at the curves for a qudit.
If one chooses an appropriate concave (or convex) function, then there is no
need to search for the absolute minimum (maximum) on the whole space, it will
be at the parametric curves. So these curves are quite useful for establishing
an uncertainty (or a certainty) relation for a general pair of settings. In the
paper, we also demonstrate that many known tight (un)certainty relations for a
qubit can be obtained with the triangle inequalities.

accomplished in two phases by sequentially addressing economic viability

samples of similar size from the simulation data. These match the observed

Previous theoretical work has found the logarithmic slope of halo density
profiles to have a well-defined minimum whose depth decreases and whose radius
increases with halo concentration. Projected profiles for the observed and
simulated cluster samples show trends with concentration which are opposite to
these predictions. In addition, for high-concentration clusters the minimum
slope occurs at significantly smaller radius than predicted. We show that these
discrepancies all reflect confusion between splashback features and features
imposed on the profiles by the cluster identification and concentration
estimation procedures. The strong apparent assembly bias is not reflected in
the three-dimensional distribution of matter around clusters. Rather it is a
consequence of the preferential contamination of low-concentration clusters by

variable. This method is based on using standard time-independent perturbation
theory of quantum mechanics to define a perturbative expansion of the
Hamiltonian operator, the small perturbation parameter being determined by the
Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\beta$. This method allows us to define an
approximate spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian operators and hence to
compute the evolution over a certain time interval. As a specific example, we
analyze the evolution of expectation values of the volume and curvature
operators starting with certain physical initial states, using both the
perturbative method and a straightforward expansion of the expectation value in
powers of the time variable. This work represents a first step towards
achieving the goal of understanding and controlling the new dynamics developed

distribution function expanded with respect to the full-range Hermite
polynomials. In order to ensure the recovery of the hydrodynamic equations for
thermal flows, we use a fourth order expansion together with a set of momentum
vectors with 25 elements whose Cartesian projections are the roots of the
Hermite polynomial of order Q = 5. Since these vectors are off-lattice, a
fifth-order projection scheme is used to evolve the corresponding set of
distribution functions. A fourth order scheme employing a 49 point stencil is
used to compute the gradient operators in the force term that ensures the
liquid-vapour phase separation and diffuse reflection boundary conditions are
used on the walls. We demonstrate at least fourth order convergence with
respect to the lattice spacing in the contexts of shear and longitudinal wave
propagation through the van der Waals fluid. For the planar interface, fourth
order convergence can be seen at small enough lattice spacings, while the
effect of the spurious velocity on the temperature profile is found to be
smaller than 1.0%, even when T w ' 0.7 T c . We further validate our scheme by
considering the Laplace pressure test. Galilean invariance is shown to be

temporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. The
multivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to
a multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the

this work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of

magnetic pressure variation so that pressure is anti-correlated with magnetic

across the boundaries of the magnetic depressions. At irregular intervals
within the magnetic depressions are long-lived pairs of magnetic islands where
the magnetic field direction reverses so that spacecraft data would reveal
sharp magnetic field depressions with only occasional crossings with jumps in

Voyager spacecraft \citep{Burlaga11,Burlaga16}. Voyager 2 data reveals that
fluctuations in the density and magnetic field strength are anti-correlated in
the sector zone as expected from reconnection but not in unipolar regions. The
consequence of the annihilation of subdominant flux is a sharp reduction in the

lensing shear and a local rotation of the plane of polarization using
observations of resolved radio sources. We show that the direction of
polarization is statistically linked with that of the gradient of the total
intensity field, and this provides the basis of our method. Using a number of
sources spread over the sky, this method allows constraints to be placed on
cosmic shear and birefringence, and it can be applied to any resolved radio
sources for which such a correlation exists. Assuming that the rotation and
shear are constant across the source, we use this relationship to construct a
quadratic estimator and investigate its properties using simulated
observations. We develop a calibration scheme using simulations based on the
observed images to mitigate a bias which occurs in the presence of measurement
errors and an astrophysical scatter on the polarization. The method is applied
directly to archival data of radio galaxies where we measure a mean rotation
signal of $\left<\omega\right>=-2.03^{\circ}\pm0.75^{\circ}$ and an average
shear compatible with zero using 30 reliable sources. This level of constraint
on an overall rotation is comparable with current leading constraints from CMB
experiments and is expected to increase by at least an order of magnitude with
future high precision radio surveys, such as those performed by the SKA. We
also measure the shear and rotation two-point correlation functions and
estimate the number of sources required to detect shear and rotation

technologies provide very long reads with high error rates (up to 15%). Second,
many genetic variants in the population are known, so the reference genome is
not considered as a single string over ACGT, but as a complex object containing

with tuned electronic energy levels in order to transport energy from where it
is collected by photon absorption, to reaction centers where the energy is used
to drive chemical reactions. In the photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobaculum
tepidum (Cba. tepidum), a member of the green sulphur bacteria (GSB) family,
light is absorbed by large antenna complexes called chlorosomes. The exciton
generated is transferred to a protein baseplate attached to the chlorosome,
before traveling through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex to the reaction
center. The energy levels of these systems are generally defined by their
chemical structure. Here we show that by placing bacteria within a photonic
microcavity, we can access the strong exciton-photon coupling regime between a
confined cavity mode and exciton states of the chlorosome, whereby a coherent
exchange of energy between the bacteria and cavity mode results in the
formation of polariton states. The polaritons have an energy distinct from that
of the exciton and photon, and can be tuned in situ via the microcavity length.
This results in real-time, non-invasive control over the relative energy levels
within the bacteria. This demonstrates the ability to strongly influence living
biological systems with photonic structures such as microcavities. We believe
that by creating polariton states, that are in this case a superposition of a
photon and excitons within a living bacteria, we can modify energy transfer
pathways and therefore study the importance of energy level alignment on the
efficiency of photosynthetic systems.

fast diffusion equation. The key ingredient in our approach is the gradient
flow structure of the dynamics. For discretization of the Lagrangian map, we
use a finite subspace of linear maps in space and a variational form of the
implicit Euler method in time. Thanks to that time discretisation, the fully
discrete solution inherits energy estimates from the original gradient flow,
and these lead to weak compactness of the trajectories in the continuous limit.
Consistency is analyzed in the planar situation, $d=2$. A variety of numerical
experiments for the porous medium equation indicates that the scheme is

different retention fractions for the black holes and neutron stars evolving in

results to study the evolution of global model parameters. We find that over
the lifetime of clusters, radial anisotropy gradually evolves from the low-mass

observable stars that are indicative of the presence of stellar-mass black
holes. We find that the model velocity scale depends on mass as $m^{-\delta}$,

velocity dispersion on $m$ can be shallower, depending on the dark remnant
content, and agrees well with that of the $N$-body models. The reported model

of ""good quality"" instances based on the word error rate (WER) scores predicted
by a QE component. To validate this hypothesis, we run several experiments on
the evaluation data sets released for the CHiME-3 challenge. First, we operate
in oracle conditions in which manual transcriptions of the evaluation data are
available, thus allowing us to compute the ""true"" sentence WER. In this
scenario, we perform the adaptation with variable amounts of data, which are
characterised by different levels of quality. Then, we move to realistic
conditions in which the manual transcriptions of the evaluation data are not
available. In this case, the adaptation is performed on data selected according
to the WER scores ""predicted"" by a QE component. Our results indicate that: i)
QE predictions allow us to closely approximate the adaptation results obtained
in oracle conditions, and ii) the overall ASR performance based on the proposed
QE-driven adaptation method is significantly better than the strong, most
recent, CHiME-3 baseline.

Analytical models and simulations predict a rapid drop in the halo density
profile associated with the transition between these two regimes. Using data
from SDSS, we explore the evidence for such a feature in the density profiles
of galaxy clusters and investigate the connection between this feature and a
possible phase space boundary. We first estimate the steepening of the outer
galaxy density profile around clusters: the profiles show an abrupt steepening,
providing evidence for truncation of the halo profile. Next, we measure the
galaxy density profile around clusters using two sets of galaxies selected
based on color. We find evidence of an abrupt change in the galaxy colors that
coincides with the location of the steepening of the density profile. Since
galaxies are likely to be quenched of star formation and turn red inside of
clusters, this change in the galaxy color distribution can be interpreted as
the transition from an infalling regime to a collapsed regime. We also measure
this transition using a model comparison approach which has been used recently
in studies of the ""splashback"" phenomenon, but find that this approach is not a
robust way to quantify the significance of detecting a splashback-like feature.
Finally, we perform measurements using an independent cluster catalog to test
for potential systematic errors associated with cluster selection. We identify
several avenues for future work: improved understanding of the small-scale
galaxy profile, lensing measurements, identification of proxies for the halo
accretion rate, and other tests. With upcoming data from the DES, KiDS and HSC

network parameters can be learned from data by training a single CNN that can
handle various video scenes. Additionally, we propose a new approach to
estimate background model from video. For the training of the CNN, we employed
randomly 5 percent video frames and their ground truth segmentations taken from
the Change Detection challenge 2014(CDnet 2014). We also utilized
spatial-median filtering as the post-processing of the network outputs. Our
method is evaluated with different data-sets, and the network outperforms the
existing algorithms with respect to the average ranking over different
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, due to the network architecture, our CNN is
capable of real time processing.

ISIT 2017",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of designing maximum distance separable
(MDS) codes over small fields with constraints on the support of their

conjecture, due to Dau et al., states that if $M$ satisfies the so-called MDS
condition, then for any field $\mathbb{F}$ of size $q\geq n+m-1$, there exists
an $[n,m]_q$ MDS code whose generator matrix $G$, with entries in $\mathbb{F}$,
fits $M$ (i.e., $M$ is the support matrix of $G$). Despite all the attempts by
the coding theory community, this conjecture remains still open in general. It
was shown, independently by Yan et al. and Dau et al., that the GM-MDS
conjecture holds if the following conjecture, referred to as the TM-MDS
conjecture, holds: if $M$ satisfies the MDS condition, then the determinant of
a transformation matrix $T$, such that $TV$ fits $M$, is not identically zero,
where $V$ is a Vandermonde matrix with distinct parameters. In this work, we
generalize the TM-MDS conjecture, and present an algebraic-combinatorial
approach based on polynomial-degree reduction for proving this conjecture. Our
proof technique's strength is based primarily on reducing inherent
combinatorics in the proof. We demonstrate the strength of our technique by
proving the TM-MDS conjecture for the cases where the number of rows ($m$) of
$M$ is upper bounded by $5$. For this class of special cases of $M$ where the
only additional constraint is on $m$, only cases with $m\leq 4$ were previously
proven theoretically, and the previously used proof techniques are not
applicable to cases with $m > 4$.

from $N$ non-communicating replicated databases. In MPIR, the user is
interested in retrieving $P$ messages out of $M$ stored messages without
leaking the identity of the retrieved messages. The information-theoretic sum
capacity of MPIR $C_s^P$ is the maximum number of desired message symbols that
can be retrieved privately per downloaded symbol. For the case $P \geq
\frac{M}{2}$, we determine the exact sum capacity of MPIR as
$C_s^P=\frac{1}{1+\frac{M-P}{PN}}$. The achievable scheme in this case is based
on downloading MDS-coded mixtures of all messages. For $P \leq \frac{M}{2}$, we
develop lower and upper bounds for all $M,P,N$. These bounds match if the total
number of messages $M$ is an integer multiple of the number of desired messages
$P$, i.e., $\frac{M}{P} \in \mathbb{N}$. In this case,
$C_s^P=\frac{1-\frac{1}{N}}{1-(\frac{1}{N})^{M/P}}$. The achievable scheme in
this case generalizes the single-message capacity achieving scheme to have
unbalanced number of stages per round of download. For all the remaining cases,
the difference between the lower and upper bound is at most $0.0082$, which
occurs for $M=5$, $P=2$, $N=2$. Our results indicate that joint retrieval of

clusters (GCs) has so far been controversial. In order to characterize the
effectiveness of integrated-light spectroscopy through integral field units, we
analyze realistic mock data generated from state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
simulations of GCs with a central IMBH, considering different setups and
conditions varying IMBH mass, cluster distance, and accuracy in determination
of the center. The mock observations are modeled with isotropic Jeans models to
assess the success rate in identifying the IMBH presence, which we find to be
primarily dependent on IMBH mass. However, even for a IMBH of considerable mass
(3% of the total GC mass), the analysis does not yield conclusive results in 1
out of 5 cases, because of shot noise due to bright stars close to the IMBH
line-of-sight. This stochastic variability in the modeling outcome grows with
decreasing BH mass, with approximately 3 failures out of 4 for IMBHs with 0.1%
of total GC mass. Finally, we find that our analysis is generally unable to
exclude at 68% confidence an IMBH with mass of $10^3~M_\odot$ in snapshots
without a central BH. Interestingly, our results are not sensitive to GC
distance within 5-20 kpc, nor to mis-identification of the GC center by less
than 2'' (<20% of the core radius). These findings highlight the value of
ground-based integral field spectroscopy for large GC surveys, where systematic
failures can be accounted for, but stress the importance of discrete kinematic

propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties to predict the
Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit (FoM) for each strategy. Of the
strategies investigated, we find the most successful to be WFC-focused.
However, further work in constraining systematics is required to fully optimize
the use of the IFC. Even without improvements to other cosmological probes, the
WFIRST SN survey has the potential to increase the FoM by more than an order of
magnitude from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented

stars present an observational challenge as their rest-frame ultraviolet
emission is negligible and they can only be reliably identified by extremely
deep near-infrared surveys. These have revealed the presence of massive,
quiescent early-type galaxies appearing in the universe as early as z$\sim$2,
an epoch 3 Gyr after the Big Bang. Their age and formation processes have now
been explained by an improved generation of galaxy formation models where they
form rapidly at z$\sim$3-4, consistent with the typical masses and ages derived
from their observations. Deeper surveys have now reported evidence for
populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier
times, however the evidence for their existence, and redshift, has relied
entirely on coarsely sampled photometry. These early massive, quiescent
galaxies are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models.
Here, we report the spectroscopic confirmation of one of these galaxies at
redshift z=3.717 with a stellar mass of 1.7$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ whose
absorption line spectrum shows no current star-formation and which has a
derived age of nearly half the age of the Universe at this redshift. The
observations demonstrates that the galaxy must have quickly formed the majority
of its stars within the first billion years of cosmic history in an extreme and

supernova simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport, which amount to a
time-dependent 5-dimensional (2 in space and 3 in momentum space) problem in
fact. Special relativistic effects are fully taken into account with a
two-energy-grid technique. We performed two simulations for a progenitor of
11.2M, employing different nuclear equations-of-state (EOS's): Lattimer and
Swesty's EOS with the incompressibility of K = 220MeV (LS EOS) and Furusawa's
EOS based on the relativistic mean field theory with the TM1 parameter set (FS
EOS). In the LS EOS the shock wave reaches ~700km at 300ms after bounce and is
still expanding whereas in the FS EOS it stalled at ~200km and has started to
recede by the same time. This seems to be due to more vigorous turbulent
motions in the former during the entire post-bounce phase, which leads to
higher neutrino-heating efficiency in the neutrino-driven convection. We also
look into the neutrino distributions in momentum space, which is the advantage
of the Boltzmann transport over other approximate methods. We find
non-axisymmetric angular distributions with respect to the local radial
direction, which also generate off-diagonal components of the Eddington tensor.
We find that the r {\theta}-component reaches ~10% of the dominant rr-component
and, more importantly, it dictates the evolution of lateral neutrino fluxes,
dominating over the {\theta}{\theta}-component, in the semi-transparent region.
These data will be useful to further test and possibly improve the
prescriptions used in the approximate methods.

galaxy between redshifts $z\sim10$ and $z\sim 4$, the epoch when several Milky
Way dSph satellites experienced extended star formation, in order to understand
in detail the physical processes which affect a low-mass halo's ability to
retain gas. It is well-established that supernova feedback is very effective at
expelling gas from a $3\times 10^7$M$_\odot$ halo, the mass of a typical
redshift 10 progenitor of a redshift 0 halo with mass $\sim10^9$M$_\odot$. We
investigate the conditions under which such a halo is able to retain sufficient
high-density gas to support extended star formation. In particular, we explore
the effects of: an increased relative concentration of the gas compared to the
dark matter; a higher concentration dark matter halo; significantly lower
supernova rates; enhanced metal cooling due to enrichment from earlier
supernovae. We show that disk-like gas distributions retain more gas than
spherical ones, primarily due to the shorter gas cooling times in the disk.
However, a significant reduction in the number of supernovae compared to that
expected for a standard initial mass function is still needed to allow the
retention of high density gas. We conclude that the progenitors of the observed
dSphs would only have retained the gas required to sustain star formation if
their mass, concentration and gas morphology were already unusual for those of
a dSph-mass halo progenitor by a redshift of 10.

estimated from scaling relations with global properties such as the stellar
masses of their host galaxies, may be biased high. Much of this may be caused
by the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole
must be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit
this issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which
self-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via
gas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to
reproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,
the model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This
behaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal
inconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the
low-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection
effects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the
observations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals
of the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations
themselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our
semi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling
relations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations
between their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with
observations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,
and is also present in the $z\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological
simulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN
feedback. This suggests that current AGN feedback models may be too weak or are
simply not capturing the effect of the black hole on the stellar velocity
dispersion.

further improved modelling of the dependence of the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux-power
spectrum on the free-streaming of dark matter, cosmological parameters, as well
as the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) with hydrodynamical
simulations, we obtain the following limits, expressed as the equivalent mass
of thermal relic WDM particles. The XQ-100 flux power spectrum alone gives a
lower limit of 1.4 keV, the re-analysis of the HIRES/MIKE sample gives 4.1 keV
while the combined analysis gives our best and significantly strengthened lower
limit of 5.3 keV (all 2$\sigma$ C.L.). The further improvement in the joint
analysis is partly due to the fact that the two data sets have different
degeneracies between astrophysical and cosmological parameters that are broken
when the data sets are combined, and more importantly on chosen priors on the
thermal evolution. These results all assume that the temperature evolution of
the IGM can be modelled as a power law in redshift. Allowing for a non-smooth
evolution of the temperature of the IGM with sudden temperature changes of up
to 5000K reduces the lower limit for the combined analysis to 3.5 keV. A WDM
with smaller thermal relic masses would require, however, a sudden temperature
jump of $5000\,K$ or more in the narrow redshift interval $z=4.6-4.8$, in
disagreement with observations of the thermal history based on high-resolution
resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data and expectations for photo-heating and
cooling in the low density IGM at these redshifts.

Significant unphysical dependences of $|V_{us}|$ on the choice of weight, w,

analysis are confirmed, and a breakdown of assumptions made in estimating
higher dimension, $D>4$, OPE contributions is identified as the main source of
these problems. A combination of continuum and lattice results is shown to
suggest a new implementation of the flavor-breaking sum rule approach in which
not only $|V_{us}|$, but also $D>4$ effective condensates, are fit to data.
Lattice results are also used to clarify how to reliably treat the slowly
converging D=2 OPE series. The new sum rule implementation is shown to cure the
problems of the unphysical w- and $s_0$-dependence of $|V_{us}|$ and to produce
results $\sim 0.0020$ higher than those of the conventional implementation.

of the similarity transformations used to relate the terminal and modal

methods have attempted to relate the two, but these relations typically rely on

derived from the physical equivalence of total power and currents between the

transmission rate by all users) for each round, subject to minimizing the
sum-rate for the previous round. To solve this problem, we use a
linear-programming approach. For the cases in which the packets are randomly

solution characterizes the minimum sum-rate for each round with high

nested groups, we derive closed-form expressions, which hold with high

confining potentials converge to equilibrium exponentially fast. Adding
irreversible perturbations to the drift of a Langevin diffusion that maintain
the same invariant measure accelerates its convergence to stationarity. Many
existing works thus advocate the use of such non-reversible dynamics for
sampling. When implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) using
time discretisations of such Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), one can
append the discretization with the usual Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step
and this is often done in practice because the accept--reject step eliminates
bias. On the other hand, such a step makes the resulting chain reversible. It
is not known whether adding the accept-reject step preserves the faster mixing
properties of the non-reversible dynamics. In this paper, we address this gap
between theory and practice by analyzing the optimal scaling of MCMC algorithms
constructed from proposal moves that are time-step Euler discretisations of an
irreversible SDE, for high dimensional Gaussian target measures. We call the
resulting algorithm the \imala, in comparison to the classical MALA algorithm
(here {\em ip} is for irreversible proposal). In order to quantify how the cost
of the algorithm scales with the dimension $N$, we prove invariance principles
for the appropriately rescaled chain. In contrast to the usual MALA algorithm,
we show that there could be two regimes asymptotically: (i) a diffusive regime,
as in the MALA algorithm and (ii) a ``fluid"" regime where the limit is an
ordinary differential equation. We provide concrete examples where the limit is
a diffusion, as in the standard MALA, but with provably higher limiting
acceptance probabilities. Numerical results are also given corroborating the
theory.

  with Acknowledgments",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of tracking the state of Gauss-Markov processes over
rate-limited erasure-prone links. We concentrate first on the scenario in which
several independent processes are seen by a single observer. The observer maps
the processes into finite-rate packets that are sent over the erasure-prone
links to a state estimator, and are acknowledged upon packet arrivals. The aim
of the state estimator is to track the processes with zero delay and with
minimum mean square error (MMSE). We show that, in the limit of many processes,
greedy quantization with respect to the squared error distortion is optimal.
That is, there is no tension between optimizing the MMSE of the process in the
current time instant and that of future times. For the case of packet erasures
with delayed acknowledgments, we connect the problem to that of compression
with side information that is known at the observer and may be known at the
state estimator - where the most recent packets serve as side information that
may have been erased, and demonstrate that the loss due to a delay by one time
unit is rather small. For the scenario where only one process is tracked by the
observer-state estimator system, we further show that variable-length coding
techniques are within a small gap of the many-process outer bound. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach for the simple setting of
discrete-time scalar linear quadratic Gaussian control with a limited data-rate
feedback that is susceptible to packet erasures.

in the star-forming or disc fraction for those in Gaussian groups compared to
those in non-Gaussian groups. By comparing the star-forming and disc fractions
of infalling galaxies to field galaxies we find evidence for the pre-processing
of both star formation rate and morphology. The strength of pre-processing
increases with halo mass and is highest for low-mass galaxies infalling onto
high-mass haloes. We show that the star formation rate of galaxies at small
radii correlates with group dynamical state, with galaxies in non- Gaussian
groups showing enhanced star-forming fractions compared to galaxies in Gaussian
groups. Similar correlations are not seen for the disc fractions of galaxies at
small radii. This seems to suggest that either the mechanisms driving star
formation quenching at small halo-centric radii are more efficient in
dynamically relaxed groups, or that non-Gaussian groups have assembled more
recently and therefore satellites of the groups will have been exposed to these
transforming mechanisms for less time.

companions to solar-type stars within ~5 AU in the mass range of ~10 - 80
M$_{\text{Jup}}$. This deficit, known as the brown dwarf desert, currently has
no conclusive explanation. New substellar companions in this region help asses
the reality of the desert and provide insight to the formation and evolution of
these objects. Here we present 10 new brown dwarf and two low-mass stellar
companion candidates around solar-type stars from the Multi-object APO
Radial-Velocity Exoplanet Large-Area Survey (MARVELS) of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey III (SDSS-III). These companions were selected from processed MARVELS
data using the latest University of Florida Two Dimensional (UF2D) pipeline,
which shows significant improvement and reduction of systematic errors over
previous pipelines. The 10 brown dwarf companions range in mass from ~13 to 76
M$_{\text{Jup}}$ and have orbital radii of less than 1 AU. The two stellar
companions have minimum masses of ~98 and 100 M$_{\text{Jup}}$. The host stars
of the MARVELS brown dwarf sample have a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.03
$\pm$ 0.08 dex. Given our stellar sample we estimate the brown dwarf occurrence
rate around solar-type stars with periods less than ~300 days to be ~0.56%.

analyzing their endogenous effect on the optimal two-part tariff and the
induced welfare gains. Two DER integration models are considered: (i) a
decentralized model involving behind-the-meter DERs in a net metering setting,
and (ii) a centralized model involving DERs integrated by the retailer. It is
shown that DERs integrated under either model can achieve the same social
welfare and the net-metering tariff structure is optimal. The retail prices
under both integration models are equal and reflect the expected wholesale
prices. The connection charges differ and are affected by the retailer's fixed
costs as well as the statistical dependencies between wholesale prices and
behind-the-meter DERs. In particular, the connection charge of the
decentralized model is generally higher than that of the centralized model. An
empirical analysis is presented to estimate the impact of DER on welfare
distribution and inter-class cross-subsidies using real price and demand data

form of narrow flux dips; when we also have rotation periods from star spots,
the two periods agree, suggesting that the flux dips are due to material
orbiting the star at the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We sometimes see

probably arising from eclipses of warm coronal gas clouds, analogous to the
sling-shot prominences postulated to explain transient H$\alpha$ absorption
features in AB Doradus itself and other rapidly rotating late type stars. For
another group of stars with somewhat longer periods, we find the short duration

are associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This
labeling technique is known as external label placement.
  In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label
placement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions
of the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast
labeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality
illustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatic
analysis of 202 handmade anatomical drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout
quality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new
geometric label placement algorithm that is based only on the most important
criteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either
as hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation
is penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach
yields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall
cost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to
deploy our approach in practice. In an experimental evaluation on real-world
anatomical drawings we show that the resulting labelings are of high quality

can be regarded as a coarse grain of GE per site. We introduce a useful
parameterization for the family of spin chains that includes the XY models with
n-site interaction, the GHZ-cluster model and a cluster-antiferromagnetic
model, the last of which exhibits QPT between a symmetry-protected topological
(SPT) phase and a symmetry-breaking antiferromagnetic phase. As the models are
exactly solvable, their ground-state wavefunctions can be obtained and thus
their GE can be studied. It turns out that the overlap of the ground states
with translationally invariant product states can be exactly calculated and
hence the GE can be obtained via further parameter optimization. The QPTs
exhibited in these models are detected by the energy gap and singular behavior
of geometric entanglement. In particular, the XzY model exhibits transitions
from the nontrivial SPT phase to a trivial paramagnetic phase. Moreover, the

exchange repeatedly interacts with bidders who have quota, making decisions
about which subsets of bidders are called to participate in ad-slot-specific
auctions. A bidder with quota cannot respond to more than a certain number of
calls per second. In practice, random throttling is the principal solution by
which these constraints are enforced. Given the repeated nature of the
interaction with its bidders, the exchange has access to data containing
information about each bidder's segments of interest. This information can be
utilized to design smarter callout mechanisms --- with the potential of
improving the exchange's long-term revenue. In this work, we present a general
framework for evaluating and comparing the performance of various callout
mechanisms using historical auction data only. To measure the impact of a
callout mechanism on long-term revenue, we propose a strategic model that
captures the repeated interaction between the exchange and bidders. Our model
leads us to two metrics for performance: immediate revenue impact and social
welfare. Next we present an empirical framework for estimating these two
metrics from historical data. For the baseline to compare against, we consider
random throttling, as well as a greedy algorithm with certain theoretical
guarantees. We propose several natural callout mechanisms and investigate them
through our framework on both synthetic and real auction data. We characterize
the conditions under which each heuristic performs well and show that, in
addition to being computationally faster, in practice our heuristics

allow us to obtain decidability of identity-free relational Kleene lattices,

Neural Network that maximizes the translation performance on a given parallel

generate new translations that approximately maximize the trained conditional
probability. The current beam search strategy generates the target sentence
word by word from left-to- right while keeping a fixed amount of active
candidates at each time step. First, this simple search is less adaptive as it
also expands candidates whose scores are much worse than the current best.
Secondly, it does not expand hypotheses if they are not within the best scoring
candidates, even if their scores are close to the best one. The latter one can
be avoided by increasing the beam size until no performance improvement can be
observed. While you can reach better performance, this has the draw- back of a
slower decoding speed. In this paper, we concentrate on speeding up the decoder
by applying a more flexible beam search strategy whose candidate size may vary
at each time step depending on the candidate scores. We speed up the original
decoder by up to 43% for the two language pairs German-English and
Chinese-English without losing any translation quality.

shortcoming, a number of academic studies have proposed methods for inferring
the demographics of social media users using details such as names, usernames,

with measures of accuracy higher than 90 percent in some studies. Race,
ethnicity and age tend to be more challenging to predict for a variety of
reasons including the novelty of social media to certain age groups and a lack
of significant deviations in user details across racial and ethnic groups.
Although the endeavor to predict user demographics is plagued with ethical
questions regarding privacy and data ownership, knowing the demographics in a
data sample can aid in addressing issues of bias and population representation,
so that existing societal inequalities are not exacerbated.

that, in presence of full unification of the additional gauge couplings and

degree of Fine-Tuning (FT) than the MSSM, when the latter is computed at the
unification scale and all available theoretical and experimental constraints,
but the Dark Matter (DM) ones, are taken into account. Yet, such a difference,
driven primarily by the collider limits requiring a high mass for the gauge
boson associated to the breaking of the additional $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group of
the BLSSM in addition to the $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ of the MSSM,

latter, if one notices that the non-minimal scenario offers a significant
volume of parameter space where numerous DM solutions of different compositions
can be found to the relic density constraints, unlike the case of the minimal
structure, wherein only one type of solution is accessible over an ever
diminishing parameter space. In fact, this different level of tension within
the two SUSY models in complying with current data is well revealed when the FT

streaming time series based on the concept of switching observable Markov chain
models. The slow time-scale non-stationary behaviors are considered to be a
mixture of quasi-stationary fast time-scale segments that are exhibited by
complex dynamical systems. The idea is to model each unique stationary
characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique
characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one
low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in
the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build
an online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level
and a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A
key observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data
likelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics
compared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for
change detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data
likelihood. Efficacy demonstration and comparative evaluation of the proposed
algorithm are performed using time series data simulated from systems that
exhibit nonlinear dynamics. We discuss results that show that the proposed
hierarchical SDF algorithm can identify underlying features with significantly
high degree of accuracy, even under very noisy conditions. Algorithm is
demonstrated to perform better than the baseline Hierarchical Dirichlet
Process-Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The low computational complexity of
algorithm makes it suitable for on-board, real time operations.

observed by the content provider. We consider two scenarios: i)~content
providers serve disjoint sets of files, ii)~there is some overlap in the
content served by multiple content providers. In the first case, we prove that
cache partitioning outperforms cache sharing as cache size and numbers of
contents served by providers go to infinity. In the second case, It can be
beneficial to have separate partitions for overlapped content. In the case of
two providers, it is usually always beneficial to allocate a cache partition to
serve all overlapped content and separate partitions to serve the
non-overlapped contents of both providers. We establish conditions when this is
true asymptotically but also present an example where it is not true
asymptotically. We develop online algorithms that dynamically adjust partition
sizes in order to maximize the overall utility and prove that they converge to
optimal solutions, and through numerical evaluations, we show they are
effective.

the mapping to project the data points' feature vectors into a similarity

circuit mechanisms that underlie the encoding of ethologically relevant,
natural stimuli. In multilayered neural circuits, nonlinear processes such as
synaptic transmission and spiking dynamics present a significant obstacle to
the creation of accurate computational models of responses to natural stimuli.
Here we demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture
retinal responses to natural scenes nearly to within the variability of a
cell's response, and are markedly more accurate than linear-nonlinear (LN)
models and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Moreover, we find two additional
surprising properties of CNNs: they are less susceptible to overfitting than
their LN counterparts when trained on small amounts of data, and generalize
better when tested on stimuli drawn from a different distribution (e.g. between
natural scenes and white noise). Examination of trained CNNs reveals several
properties. First, a richer set of feature maps is necessary for predicting the
responses to natural scenes compared to white noise. Second, temporally precise
responses to slowly varying inputs originate from feedforward inhibition,
similar to known retinal mechanisms. Third, the injection of latent noise
sources in intermediate layers enables our model to capture the sub-Poisson
spiking variability observed in retinal ganglion cells. Fourth, augmenting our
CNNs with recurrent lateral connections enables them to capture contrast
adaptation as an emergent property of accurately describing retinal responses
to natural scenes. These methods can be readily generalized to other sensory
modalities and stimulus ensembles. Overall, this work demonstrates that CNNs
not only accurately capture sensory circuit responses to natural scenes, but
also yield information about the circuit's internal structure and function.

expected to be highly circularly polarised therefore we restricted our search
to the circular polarisation images rather than the total intensity images. We
carried out two different search methods using this data. The first method was
a targeted search for exoplanet emission using catalogues of known stars and

blind search for highly circularly polarised sources in the field and for

variables X and Y is the value of their mutual information. Unfortunately, this
task is often stymied by the extremely large dimension of the variables. We
might hope to replace each variable by a lower-dimensional representation that
preserves the relationship with the other variable. The theoretically ideal
implementation is the use of minimal sufficient statistics, where it is
well-known that either X or Y can be replaced by their minimal sufficient
statistic about the other while preserving the mutual information. While
intuitively reasonable, it is not obvious or straightforward that both
variables can be replaced simultaneously. We demonstrate that this is in fact
possible: the information X's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about Y is
exactly the information that Y's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about
X. As an important corollary, we consider the case where one variable is a
stochastic process' past and the other its future and the present is viewed as
a memoryful channel. In this case, the mutual information is the channel
transmission rate between the channel's effective states. That is, the
past-future mutual information (the excess entropy) is the amount of
information about the future that can be predicted using the past. Translating
our result about minimal sufficient statistics, this is equivalent to the
mutual information between the forward- and reverse-time causal states of
computational mechanics. We close by discussing multivariate extensions to this
use of minimal sufficient statistics.

adiabatic hard ends filled with CO2 at three supercritical pressures. The
corresponding initial temperature values are taken along the pseudo-boiling
line. Thermodynamic and transport properties of CO2 in near-critical conditions
are modeled via the Peng-Robinson equation of state and Chung's Method. A heat
source is applied at a distance from one end, with heat release intensities
spanning the range 10^3-10^11 W/m^2, generating isentropic compression waves
for values < 10^9 W/m^2. For higher heat-release rates such compressions are
coalescent with distinct shock-like features (e.g. non-isentropicity and
propagation Mach numbers measurably greater than unity) and a non-uniform
post-shock state is present due to the strong thermodynamic nonlinearities. The
resulting compression wave intensities have been collapsed via the thermal
expansion coefficient, highly variable in near-critical fluids, used as one of
the scaling parameters for the reference energy. The proposed scaling applies
to isentropic thermoacoustic waves as well as shock waves up to shock strength
2. Long-term time integration reveals resonance behavior of the compression
waves, raising the mean pressure and temperature at every resonance cycle. When
the heat injection is halted, expansion waves are generated, which counteract
the compression waves leaving conduction as the only thermal relaxation
process. In the long term evolution, the decay in amplitude of the resonating
waves observed in the experiments is qualitatively reproduced by using
isothermal boundary conditions.

by exploiting storage resources at end users and predictability of user demand
processes, we design the optimal joint pushing and caching policy to maximize
bandwidth utilization, which is of fundamental importance to mobile telecom
carriers. In particular, we formulate the stochastic optimization problem as an
infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process (MDP), for which there
generally exist only numerical solutions without many insights. By structural
analysis, we show how the optimal policy achieves a balance between the current
transmission cost and the future average transmission cost. In addition, we
show that the optimal average transmission cost decreases with the cache size,
revealing a tradeoff between the cache size and the bandwidth utilization.
Then, due to the fact that obtaining a numerical optimal solution suffers the
curse of dimensionality and implementing it requires a centralized controller
and global system information, we develop a decentralized policy with
polynomial complexity w.r.t. the numbers of users and files as well as cache
size, by a linear approximation of the value function and optimization
relaxation techniques. Next, we propose an online decentralized algorithm to
implement the proposed low-complexity decentralized policy using the technique
of Q-learning, when priori knowledge of user demand processes is not available.
Finally, using numerical results, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed

conductive state to another state where charge conductivity is greatly
suppressed when decreasing the temperature. Here we demonstrate two consecutive
transitions in NdNiO3 films with CoFe2O4 capping, in which the metal-insulator
transition occurs at 85 K, followed by an unprecedented insulator-metal
transition below 40 K. The emerging insulator-metal transition associated with
a weak antiferromagnetic behavior is observed in 20 unit cell-thick NdNiO3 with
more than 5 unit cell CoFe2O4 capping. Differently, the NdNiO3 films with
thinner CoFe2O4 capping only exhibit metal-insulator transition at 85 K,
accompanied by a strong antiferromagnetic state below 40 K. Charge transfer
from Co to Ni, instead of from Fe to Ni, formulates the ferromagnetic
interaction between Ni-Ni and Ni-Co atoms, thus suppressing the
antiferromagnetic feature and producing metallic conductive behavior.
Furthermore, a phase diagram for the metal-insulator-metal transition in this
system is drawn.

Although the viral marketing related problems in OSNs have been extensively
studied in the past decade, the existing works all assume known propagation
rates and are not able to solve the scenario when the rates may dynamically
increase for popular topics. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Dynamic
Influence Propagation (DIP), which allows propagation rates to change during
the diffusion and can be used for describing information propagation in OSNs
more realistically. Based on DIP, we define a new research problem: Threshold
Activation Problem under DIP (TAP-DIP). TAP-DIP is more generalized than TAP
and can be used for studying the DIP model. However, it adds another layer of
complexity over the already \#P-hard TAP problem. Despite it hardness, we are
able to approximate TAP-DIP with $O(\log|V|)$ ratio. Our solution consists of
two major parts: 1) the Lipschitz optimization technique and 2) a novel
solution to the general version of TAP, the Multi-TAP problem. We
experimentally test our solution Using various real OSN datasets, and
demonstrate that our solution not only generates high-quality yet much smaller
seed sets when being aware of the rate increase, but also is scalable. In
addition, considering DIP or not has a significant difference in seed set

the environmental attributes to be observed can vary both spatially and
temporally, and the target environment is usually a large and continuous domain
whereas the sampling data is typically sparse and limited. The challenges
require that the sampling method must be informative and efficient enough to
catch up with the environmental dynamics. In this paper we present a planning
and learning method that enables a sampling robot to perform persistent
monitoring tasks by learning and refining a dynamic ""data map"" that models a
spatiotemporal environment attribute such as ocean salinity content. Our
environmental sampling framework consists of two components: to maximize the
information collected, we propose an informative planning component that
efficiently generates sampling waypoints that contain the maximal information;
To alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data
accumulated, we develop a component based on a sparse Gaussian Process whose
hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data
that provides the greatest contribution. We validate our method with both
simulations running on real ocean data and field trials with an ASV in a lake

of quantum gates, by performing random circuits that would do nothing if the
gates were perfect. In the limit of no finite-sampling error, the exponential
decay rate of the observable survival probabilities, versus circuit length,
yields a single error metric $r$. For Clifford gates with arbitrary small
errors described by process matrices, $r$ was believed to reliably correspond
to the mean, over all Cliffords, of the average gate infidelity (AGI) between
the imperfect gates and their ideal counterparts. We show that this quantity is
not a well-defined property of a physical gateset. It depends on the
representations used for the imperfect and ideal gates, and the variant
typically computed in the literature can differ from $r$ by orders of
magnitude. We present new theories of the RB decay that are accurate for all
small errors describable by process matrices, and show that the RB decay curve

it does not correspond to the infidelity of a physically allowed (completely

Although the low energy fractional excitations of one dimensional integrable

energies. Based on the algebraic Bethe ansatz formalism, we study spin dynamics
in a representative one dimensional strongly correlated model, {\it i.e. }, the
antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with the Ising anisotropy, via
the form-factor formulae. Various excitations at different energy scales are
identified crucial to the dynamic spin structure factors under the guidance of
sum rules. At small magnetic polarizations, gapless excitations dominate the
low energy spin dynamics arising from the magnetic-field-induced
incommensurability. In contrast, spin dynamics at intermediate and high
energies is characterized by the two- and three-string states, which are
multi-particle excitations based on the commensurate N\'eel ordered background.
Our work is helpful for experimental studies on spin dynamics in both condensed
matter and cold atom systems beyond the low energy effective Luttinger liquid
theory. Based on an intuitive physical picture, we speculate that the dynamic
feature at high energies due to the multi-particle anti-bound state excitations

Waals bonded solids, such as hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide (a
topological insulator), offers intriguing possibilities for creating strongly
modified light-matter interactions. However, open problems exist in quantifying
electromagnetic field fluctuations in these media, complicating typical
approaches for modeling photonic characteristics. Here, we address this issue
by linking the identifying traits of hyperbolic response to a coupling between
longitudinal and transverse fields that can not occur in isotropic media. This
description allows us to calculate the influence of hyperbolic response on
electromagnetic fluctuations without explicitly imposing a characteristic size
(model of nonlocality), leading to formally bounded expressions so long as
material absorption is included. We then apply this framework to two exemplary
areas: the optical sum rule for modified spontaneous emission enhancement in a
general uniaxial medium, and thermal electromagnetic field fluctuations in
hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide. We find that while the sum rule
is satisfied, it does not constrain the enhancement of light-matter
interactions in either case. We also show that both hexagonal boron nitride and
bismuth selenide possess broad spectral regions where the magnitude of
electromagnetic field fluctuations are over 120 times larger, and over 800
times larger along specific angular directions, than they are in vacuum.

of DNA/cDNA fragments in parallel. After the resulting sequences (short reads)
are mapped to the genome, one gets a sequence of short read counts along the

to the success of sequencing technologies. Nonparametric methods, in particular
smoothing splines, have been used extensively for modeling and processing
single sequencing samples. However, nonparametric joint modeling of multiple
second-generation sequencing samples is still lacking due to computational
cost. In this article, we develop an adaptive basis selection method for
efficient computation of exponential family smoothing splines for modeling
multiple second-generation sequencing samples. Our adaptive basis selection
gives a sparse approximation of smoothing splines, yielding a lower-dimensional
effective model space for a more scalable computation. The asymptotic analysis
shows that the effective model space is rich enough to retain essential
features of the data. Moreover, exponential family smoothing spline models
computed via adaptive basis selection are shown to have good statistical
properties, e.g., convergence at the same rate as that of full basis
exponential family smoothing splines. The empirical performance is demonstrated
through simulation studies and two second-generation sequencing data examples.

a spin glass behavior without the magnetoelectric effect. Monte Carlo
simulations support the experimental findings and suggest that the site
disorder suppresses long - range antiferromagnetic order and induces a spin
glass state. Since the linear magnetoelectric effect requires a long - range
magnetic ordering, we suggest that the ground state of CoAl2O4 with low site

achieves a static profile and reaches an asymptotic value away from the
galactic center. For simple scalar-dark matter interaction and quadratic scalar
self interaction potential, we show that dark matter behaves exactly like cold
dark matter (CDM) beyond few $\rm{kpc}$ away from galactic center but at closer
distance it becomes lighter and fermi pressure cannot be ignored anymore. Using
Thomas-Fermi approximation, we numerically solve the radial static profile of
the scalar field, fermion mass and dark matter energy density as a function of
distance. We find that for fifth force mediated by an ultra light scalar, it is
possible to obtain a flattened dark matter density profile towards galactic
center. In our scenario, the fifth force can be neglected at distance $ r \geq
1\, \rm{kpc}$ from galactic center and dark matter can be simply treated as
heavy non-relativistic particles beyond this distance, thus reproducing the
success of CDM at large scales.

novel forms of topological order (i.e. topological charges), primarily the

these topological orders can protect bulk current transmission, even when the
topologically trivial phase possesses an arbitrarily large band gap. Such a

invariants from temporal planning instances. It first identifies a set of
invariant templates by inspecting the lifted representation of the domain and
then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance. Our
technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the
literature, but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by
addressing temporal domains. To deal with time, we formulate invariance
conditions that account for the entire structure of the actions and the
possible concurrent interactions between them. As a result, we construct a
significantly more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able
to find not only invariants for temporal domains, but also a broader set of
invariants for non-temporal domains. The experimental results reported in this
paper provide evidence that identifying a broader set of invariants results in
the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables with larger domains. We
show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects
positively on the performance of a number of temporal planners that use a
variable/value representation by significantly reducing their running time.

State-of-the-art photon-driven sources have good monochromaticity but poor
phase synchronization. In contrast, field-driven photoemission has much higher
light phase synchronization, due to the intrinsic sub-cycle emission dynamics,
but poor monochromaticity. Such sources suffer from larger electron energy
spreads (3 - 100 eV) attributed to the relatively low field enhancement of the
conventional metal tips which necessitates long pump wavelengths (> 800 nm) in
order to gain sufficient ponderomotive potential to access the field-driven

nanotubes excited by a femtosecond laser at a short wavelength of 410 nm has
been realized. The energy spread of field-driven electrons is effectively

shorting some parts of the state space into singletons. A natural way to
construct such processes is via Dirichlet forms restricted to the function
space whose members take constant values on these collapsing parts. They
include as a special case Brownian motion with darning, which has been studied
in details in \cite{Chen, CF, CFR}. When the initial processes have
discontinuous sample paths, the processes constructed in this paper are the
genuine extensions of those studied in Chen and Fukushima \cite{CF}. We further
show that, up to a time change, these Markov processes with darning can be
approximated in the finite dimensional sense by introducing additional large
intensity jumps among these compact sets to be collapsed into singletons to the
original Markov processes. For diffusion processes, it is also possible to get,
up to a time change, diffusions with darning by increasing the conductance on
these compact sets to infinity. To accomplish these, we extend the semigroup
characterization of Mosco convergence to closed symmetric forms whose domain of
definition may not be dense in the $L^2$-space. The latter is of independent
interest and potentially useful to study convergence of Markov processes having
different state spaces. Indeed, we show in Section 5 of this paper that
Brownian motion in a plane with a very thin flag pole can be approximated by
Brownian motion in the plane with a vertical cylinder whose horizontal motion
on the cylinder is a circular Brownian motion moving at fast speed.

ideal, full information estimation (FIE) which uses all measurements up to the
time of estimation. Despite extensive studies, the stability analyses of FIE
and MHE for discrete-time nonlinear systems with bounded process and
measurement disturbances, remain an open challenge. This work aims to provide a
systematic solution for the challenge. First, we prove that FIE is robustly
globally asymptotically stable (RGAS) if the cost function admits a property
mimicking the incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS) of the
system and has a sufficient sensitivity to the uncertainty in the initial
state. Second, we establish an explicit link from the RGAS of FIE to that of
MHE, and use it to show that MHE is RGAS under enhanced conditions if the
moving horizon is long enough to suppress the propagation of uncertainties. The
theoretical results imply flexible MHE designs with assured robust stability
for a broad class of i-IOSS systems. Numerical experiments on linear and
nonlinear systems are used to illustrate the designs and support the findings.

atmosphere. By original definition, the main EB's characteristic is the two
emission bumps in both wings of chromospheric lines, such as H$\alpha$ and Ca
II 8542 {\AA} lines. Up to now, most authors found that the temperature
increase of EBs around the temperature minimum region is in the range of
600K-3000K. However, with recent IRIS observations, some authors proposed that
the temperature increase of EBs could be more than 10000K. Using non-LTE
semi-empirical modeling, we investigate the line profiles, continuum emission
and the radiative losses for the EB models with different temperature
increases, and compare them with observations. Our result indicates that if the
EB maximum temperature attains more than 10000K around the temperature minimum
region, then the resulted H$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 {\AA} line profiles and the
continuum emission would be much stronger than that of EB observations.
Moreover, due to the high radiative losses, the high temperature EB would have
a very short lifetime, which is not comparable with the observations. Thus, our
study does not support the proposal that the EB temperatures are higher than
10000K.

techniques of optimal control theory to establish the existence of Lagrange

existence of the extremely fast disk winds with outflow velocities of

black holes and host galaxies since they are expected to carry a large amount
of kinetic energy. One of the common characteristics of these fast winds is a
strong time variability of the absorption feature. To investigate this
variability, we have developed a new X-ray spectral model of the disk winds,
which is generated by 3-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulations
on the assumption of the realistic wind geometry. By applying our wind model to
the multi-epoch X-ray data of an archetypal wind source PDS 456, we find the
variability in the absorption line is explained by a change of the wind
outflowing angle without any large variability in the mass outflow rate of the
wind. This result indicates that the fast disk winds are stable and that local
hydrodynamic instabilities produce a large time variability of the absorption
line. Moreover, we also apply our wind model to the disk-line source 1H

reproduced our disk wind model for all the observations.

significantly improves the description of phosphorus clusters. Emphasis has

phosphorene with different types of defects. Compared to nonreactive SW
potential [1], ReaxFF for P/H systems provides a huge improvement in describing
the mechanical properties the pristine and defected black phosphorene and the

observed that single vacancies weaken the black phosphorene more than double

response of black phosphorene is more sensitive to defects for the zigzag

extensions to the heterogeneous systems, such as oxides, nitrides, ReaxFF

the helical pairing states which preserve the TRS. We also study the dependence

$I_{c}(\Phi) \neq I_{c}(-\Phi)$ in a chiral state and
$I_{c}(\Phi)=I_{c}(-\Phi)$ in a helical state. We calculate $I_c(\Phi)$ in a

relation $I_{c}(\Phi)=I_{c}(-\Phi)$ is satisfied for all the pairing states and
it is impossible to distinguish chiral state from helical one. On the other

from the Lbol-Menv diagram, yields 12 candidate massive dense cores that may
form high-mass stars. The core formation efficiency (CFE) for the 8 massive
condensations shows an increasing trend of the CFE with density. This suggests
that the denser the condensation, the higher the fraction of its mass

Similarly, the large radius expansion reproduces the exact $F^4$ coupling in
four dimensions, including both supersymmetric invariants, plus infinite series
of instanton corrections from half-BPS dyons winding around the large circle,

multimedia data efficiently have attracted broad research interests in the
recent years. With rapid explosion of newly emerged concepts and online data,
existing supervised hashing algorithms suffer from the problem of scarcity of
ground truth annotations due to the high cost of obtaining manual annotations.
Therefore, we propose an algorithm to learn a hash function from training
images belonging to `seen' classes which can efficiently encode images of
`unseen' classes to binary codes. Specifically, we project the image features
from visual space and semantic features from semantic space into a common
Hamming subspace. Earlier works to generate hash codes have tried to relax the
discrete constraints on hash codes and solve the continuous optimization
problem. However, it often leads to quantization errors. In this work, we use
the max-margin classifier to learn an efficient hash function. To address the
concern of domain-shift which may arise due to the introduction of new classes,
we also introduce an unsupervised domain adaptation model in the proposed
hashing framework. Results on the three datasets show the advantage of using
domain adaptation in learning a high-quality hash function and superiority of
our method for the task of image retrieval performance as compared to several
state-of-the-art hashing methods.

of matter characterized by the presence of topologically protected degeneracies
near the Fermi level. These degeneracies are the source of exotic phenomena,
including the realization of chiral Weyl fermions as quasiparticles in the bulk
and the formation of Fermi arc states on the surfaces. Here, we demonstrate
that these two key signatures show distinct evolutions with the bulk band
topology by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by
first-principle calculations, on transition-metal monophosphides. While Weyl
fermion quasiparticles exist only when the chemical potential is located
between two saddle points of the Weyl cone features, the Fermi arc states
extend in a larger energy scale and are robust across the bulk Lifshitz
transitions associated with the recombination of two non-trivial Fermi surfaces
enclosing one Weyl point into a single trivial Fermi surface enclosing two Weyl
points of opposite chirality. Therefore, in some systems (e.g. NbP),
topological Fermi arc states are preserved even if Weyl fermion quasiparticles
are absent in the bulk. Our findings not only provide insight into the
relationship between the exotic physical phenomena and the intrinsic bulk band
topology in Weyl semimetals, but also resolve the apparent puzzle of the
different magneto-transport properties observed in TaAs, TaP and NbP, where the
Fermi arc states are similar.

(LSSVM) has been widely used for classification and regression problems having
the comparable performance with other types of SVMs. However, LSSVM has two
drawbacks: sensitive to outliers and lacking sparseness. Robust LSSVM (R-LSSVM)
overcomes the first partly via nonconvex truncated loss function, but the
current algorithms for R-LSSVM with the dense solution are faced with the
second drawback and are inefficient for training large-scale problems. In this
paper, we interpret the robustness of R-LSSVM from a re-weighted viewpoint and
give a primal R-LSSVM by the representer theorem. The new model may have sparse
solution if the corresponding kernel matrix has low rank. Then approximating
the kernel matrix by a low-rank matrix and smoothing the loss function by
entropy penalty function, we propose a convergent sparse R-LSSVM (SR-LSSVM)
algorithm to achieve the sparse solution of primal R-LSSVM, which overcomes two
drawbacks of LSSVM simultaneously. The proposed algorithm has lower complexity
than the existing algorithms and is very efficient for training large-scale

uniqueness of such optimal portfolios as well as their sensitivity to changes

continuity properties of the set-valued map associating to each capital
position the corresponding set of optimal portfolios. We pay special attention
to lower semicontinuity, which is the key continuity property from a financial
perspective. This ""stability"" property is always satisfied if the test is based
on a polyhedral risk measure but it generally fails once we depart from
polyhedrality even when the reference risk measure is convex. However, lower
semicontinuity can be often achieved if one if one is willing to focuses on
portfolios that are close to being optimal. Besides capital adequacy, our
results have a variety of natural applications to pricing, hedging, and capital

quantum information processing. The completeness of the language -- i.e. the
ability to derive any true equation -- is a crucial question. In the quest of a
complete ZX-calculus, supplementarity has been recently proved to be necessary
for quantum diagram reasoning (MFCS 2016). Roughly speaking, supplementarity
consists in merging two subdiagrams when they are parameterized by antipodal
angles. We introduce a generalised supplementarity -- called cyclotomic
supplementarity -- which consists in merging n subdiagrams at once, when the n
angles divide the circle into equal parts. We show that when n is an odd prime
number, the cyclotomic supplementarity cannot be derived, leading to a
countable family of new axioms for diagrammatic quantum reasoning.We exhibit
another new simple axiom that cannot be derived from the existing rules of the
ZX-Calculus, implying in particular the incompleteness of the language for the
so-called Clifford+T quantum mechanics. We end up with a new axiomatisation of
an extended ZX-Calculus, including an axiom schema for the cyclotomic
supplementarity.

and contact line drag acting on the droplet and show that asymmetry can often
lead to a reduced contact time and lift-off in an elongated shape. The model
allows us to explain the mechanisms behind non-axisymmetric bouncing in terms
of surface tension forces. Once the drop has an elliptical footprint the
surface tension force acting on the longer sides is greater. Therefore the
shorter axis retracts faster and, due to the incompressibility constraints,
pumps fluid along the more extended droplet axis. This leads to a positive
feedback, allowing the drop to jump in an elongated configuration, and more
quickly.

applies a one dimensional wavelet transform to the obtained vector, decimates
the points and iterates the procedure. The main drawback of such method is the
need to store, for each level of the transform, the path which vectorizes the
two dimensional data. Here we propose a variation on the method which consists
of firstly applying a segmentation procedure to the function domain,
partitioning it into regions where the variation in the function values is low;
in a second step, inside each such region, a path is found in some
deterministic way, i.e. not data-dependent. This circumvents the need to store
the paths at each level, while still obtaining good quality lossy compression.

profiles and velocity vector maps of the Mach wings show interesting structural
changes when they interact with each other and form patterns similar to
interference fringes. Compared to the co-propagating Mach cones, the wings of
counter propagating Mach cones produce a larger number of maxima and minima in
the pattern resulting from their mutual interaction. In addition the time
duration of the formation of two maxima or minima at a particular point
decreases due to the interactions of Mach cones. Another notable feature is
that the spacing between adjacent maxima increases while the fringe angle
decreases with the increase of relative velocity of the counter propagating

used for the reconstruction of the same. Matched wavelet can be easily designed
if full image is available. Also matched wavelet may provide better
reconstruction results in CS application compared to standard wavelet
sparsifying basis. Since in CS application, we have compressively sensed image
instead of full image, existing methods of designing matched wavelet cannot be
used. Thus, we propose a joint framework that estimates matched wavelet from
the compressively sensed images and also reconstructs full images. This paper
has three significant contributions. First, lifting-based, image-matched
separable wavelet is designed from compressively sensed images and is also used
to reconstruct the same. Second, a simple sensing matrix is employed to sample
data at sub-Nyquist rate such that sensing and reconstruction time is reduced
considerably without any noticeable degradation in the reconstruction
performance. Third, a new multi-level L-Pyramid wavelet decomposition strategy
is provided for separable wavelet implementation on images that leads to
improved reconstruction performance. Compared to CS-based reconstruction using
standard wavelets with Gaussian sensing matrix and with existing wavelet
decomposition strategy, the proposed methodology provides faster and better
image reconstruction in compressive sensing application.

including the solar cells. In conventional photoconductors, the electrons and
holes created by light irradiation are separated by the external electric
field, resulting in a current flowing into electrodes. Shift current in
noncentrosymmetric systems is distinct from this conventional photocurrent in
the sense that no external electric field is needed, and, more remarkably, is
driven by the Berry phase inherent to the Bloch wavefunction. It is analogous
to the polarization current in the ground state but is a d.c. current
continuously supported by the nonequilibrium steady state under the pumping by
light. Here we show theoretically, by employing Keldysh-Floquet formalism
applied to a simple one-dimensional model, that the local photo excitation can
induce the shift current which is independent of the position and width of the
excited region and also the length of the system. This feature is in stark
contrast to the conventional photocurrent, which is suppressed when the sample
is excited locally at the middle and increases towards the electrodes. This
finding reveals the unconventional nature of shift current and will pave a way
to design a highly efficient photovoltaic effect in solids.

distributed problems in the SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio)
model for radio transmission. A setting typically studied is when all nodes
transmit a signal of the same strength, and each device only has access to
knowledge about the total number of nodes in the network $n$, the range from
which each node's label is taken $[1,\dots,N]$, and the label of the device
itself. In addition, an assumption is made that each node also knows its
coordinates in the Euclidean plane. In this paper, we create a technique which
allows algorithm designers to remove that last assumption. The assumption about
the unavailability of the knowledge of the physical coordinates of the nodes
truly captures the `ad-hoc' nature of wireless networks.
  Previous work in this area uses a flavor of a technique called dilution, in
which nodes transmit in a (predetermined) round-robin fashion, and are able to
reach all their neighbors. However, without knowing the physical coordinates,
it's not possible to know the coordinates of their containing (pivotal) grid
box and seemingly not possible to use dilution (to coordinate their
transmissions). We propose a new technique to achieve dilution without using
the knowledge of physical coordinates. This technique exploits the
understanding that the transmitting nodes lie in 2-D space, segmented by an
appropriate pivotal grid, without explicitly referring to the actual physical
coordinates of these nodes. Using this technique, it is possible for every weak
device to successfully transmit its message to all of its neighbors in
$\Theta(\lg N)$ rounds, as long as the density of transmitting nodes in any
physical grid box is bounded by a known constant. This technique, we feel, is
an important generic tool for devising practical protocols when physical
coordinates of the nodes are not known.

Carlo-based techniques. IS allows the approximation of a target probability
distribution by drawing samples from a proposal (or importance) distribution,
different from the target, and computing importance weights (IWs) that account
for the discrepancy between these two distributions. The main drawback of IS
schemes is the degeneracy of the IWs, which significantly reduces the
efficiency of the method. It has been recently proposed to use transformed IWs
(TIWs) to alleviate the degeneracy problem in the context of Population Monte
Carlo, which is an iterative version of IS. However, the effectiveness of this
technique for standard IS is yet to be investigated. In this letter we
numerically assess the performance of IS when using TIWs, and show that the
method can attain robustness to weight degeneracy thanks to a bias/variance
trade-off.

constitutes a promising tool in biosensing, targeted delivery and environmental
remediation. In particular, recent experiments have demonstrated that fuel-free
propulsion can be achieved through the application of external magnetic fields
on magnetic helically shaped structures. The magnetic interaction between
helices and the rotating field induces a torque that rotates and propels them
via the coupled rotational-translational motion. Recent works have shown that
there exist certain optimal geometries of helical shapes for propulsion.
However, experiments show that controlled motion remains a challenge at the
nanoscale due to Brownian motion that interferes with the deterministic motion
and makes it difficult to achieve controlled steering. In the present work we
employ quantitatively accurate simulation methodology to design a setup for
which magnetic nanohelices of 30 nm in radius, with and without cargo, can be
accurately propelled and steered in the presence of thermal fluctuations. In
particular, we demonstrate fast transport of such nanomotors and devise
protocols in manipulating external fields to achieve directionally controlled

involves in many cases the aid of metal nanoparticles (NPs). It is highly
beneficial if one can define both diameter and position of the initial NPs and
make well-defined nanowire arrays. This sets additional requirement on the NPs
with respect to being able to withstand a pre-growth annealing process (i.e.
de- oxidation of the III-V semiconductor surface) in an epitaxy system.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that Ag may be an alternative to using Au
NPs as seeds for particle-seeded nanowire fabrication. This work brings light
onto the effect of annealing of Au, Ag and Au-Ag alloy NP arrays in two
commonly used epitaxial systems, the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and the
Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). The NP arrays are fabricated with the
aid of Electron Beam Lithography on GaAs 100 and 111B wafers and the evolution
of the NPs with respect to shape, size and position on the surfaces are studied
after annealing using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We find that while
the Au NP arrays are found to be stable when annealed up to 600 $^{\circ}$C in
a MOVPE system, a diameter and pitch dependent splitting of the particles are
seen for annealing in a MBE system. The Ag NP arrays are less stable, with
smaller diameters ($\leq$ 50 nm) dissolving during annealing in both epitaxial
systems. In general, the mobility of the NPs is observed to differ between the
two the GaAs 100 and 111B surfaces. While the initial pattern is found be
intact on the GaAs 111B surface for a particular annealing process and particle
type, the increased mobility of the NP on the 100 may influence the initial
pre-defined positions at higher annealing temperatures. The effect of annealing
on Au-Ag alloy NP arrays suggests that these NP can withstand necessary
annealing conditions for a complete de-oxidation of GaAs surfaces.

$\Delta_0$ and selecting parent distribution functions with exponential (the
Schulz distribution) or Gaussian decays. In the second part we study the phase

is changed. We characterize in detail the orientational ordering of particles
and the fractionation of different species between the coexisting phases. Also
we study the character (second vs. first order) of the Isotropic-Nematic phase
transition as a function of polydispersity. We particularly focused on the
stability of the Tetratic phase as a function of $\kappa_0$ and $\Delta_0$. The
Isotropic-Nematic transition becomes strongly of first order when
polydispersity is increased: the coexisting gap widens and the location of the
tricritical point moves to higher values of $\kappa_0$ while the Tetratic phase
is slightly destabilized with respect to the Nematic one. The results obtained

does creating additional wind fields from the climate model, even if an

their volumes. We can then use the volume, in combination with the known mass,

the expected uncertainty in the volume and size as well. We present shape

mass estimates from the literature allowed us to derive their bulk densities.
We clearly see a trend of lower bulk densities for primitive objects

these reasons, the approximate costs of a launch base, which will be installed
to conduct space researches in Turkey, and of a satellite or a spacecraft,
which will be able to launch from this base and serve a variety of purposes,
are calculated in this study. In an effort to make the mentioned calculations,
examples of various countries that have already established a launch base and
already launched from these bases are analyzed and some projections are built
for Turkey by calculating the estimated costs. Since these projections must be
carried out by the Republic of Turkey since the private sector in Turkey will
not be willing to invest in such activities, the possible public advantages can

low-mass black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg show a small but statistically
significant change of polarization degree ($\Delta p \sim 1$ per cent) between
the outburst in June 2015 and the quiescence. The polarization of V404 Cyg in
the quiescent state agrees within the errors with that of the visually close
(1\farcs4) companion ($p_{R} = 7.3\pm 0.1$ per cent), indicating that it is
predominantly of interstellar origin. The polarization pattern of the
surrounding field stars supports this conclusion. From the observed variable
polarization during the outburst we show that polarization degree of the
intrinsic component peaks in the $V$-band, $p_{V} = 1.1\pm 0.1$ per cent, at
the polarization position angle of $\theta_{V}= -7\deg\pm 2\deg$, which is
consistent in all three passbands. We detect significant variations in the
position angle of the intrinsic polarization in $R$ band from $-30\deg$ to
$\sim 0\deg$ during the outburst peak. The observed wavelength dependence of
the intrinsic polarization does not support non-thermal synchrotron emission
from a jet as a plausible mechanism, but is in better agreement with the
combined effect of electron (Thomson) scattering and absorption in a flattened
plasma envelope or outflow surrounding the illuminating source. Alternatively,
the polarization signal can be produced by scattering of the disc radiation in
a mildly relativistic polar outflow. The position angle of the intrinsic
polarization, nearly parallel to the jet direction (i.e. perpendicular to the
accretion disc plane), is in agreement with these interpretations.

lies in the construction of a strong appearance model that captures features

features. These features memorize the global pattern of the object and have an
internal star graph-like structure. These features are unique and flexible and
helps tracking generic and deformable objects with no limitation on specific
objects. In addition, the relevance of each feature is evaluated online using
short-term consistency and long-term consistency. These parameters are adapted
to retain consistent features that vote for the object location and that deal
with outliers for long-term tracking scenarios. Additionally, voting in a
Gaussian manner helps in tackling inherent noise of the tracking system and in
accurate object localization. Furthermore, the proposed tracker uses pairwise
distance measure to cope with scale variations and combines pixel-level binary
features and global weighted color features for model update. Finally,
experimental results on a visual tracking benchmark dataset are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed tracker.

recent star formation, and the galaxy optical structure mapping older stellar
populations. We performed their UV surface photometry and used BVRI photometry
from other sources. Our integrated magnitudes have been analyzed and compared
with corresponding values in the literature. We characterize the overall galaxy
structure best fitting the UV and optical luminosity profiles using a single
Sersic law. NGC 1366, NGC 1426, NGC 3818, NGC 3962 and NGC 7192 show
featureless luminosity profiles. Excluding NGC 1366 which has a clear edge-on
disk , n~1-2, and NGC 3818, the remaining three have Sersic's indices n~3-4 in
optical and a lower index in the UV. Bright ring/arm-like structures are
revealed by UV images and luminosity profiles of NGC 1415, NGC 1533, NGC 1543,
NGC 2685, NGC 2974 and IC 2006. The ring/arm-like structures are different from
galaxy to galaxy. Sersic indices of UV profiles for those galaxies are in the
range n=1.5-3 both in S0s and in Es. In our sample optical Sersic indices are
usually larger than the UV ones. (M2-V) color profiles are bluer in
ring/arm-like structures with respect to the galaxy body. The lower values of
Sersic's indices in the UV bands with respect to optical ones, suggesting the
presence of a disk, point out that the role of the dissipation cannot be
neglected in recent evolutionary phases of these early-type galaxies.

similar method, a program Structure Prototype Analysis Package (SPAP) was

extract predicted low energy structures for a separate theoretical structure
database. A series of statistics describing the distribution of crystal
structure prototypes in the CSPD was compiled to provide an important insight
for structure prediction and high-throughput calculations. Illustrative
examples of the application of the proposed database are given, including the
generation of initial structures for structure prediction and determination of
the prototype structure in databases. These examples demonstrate the CSPD to be

these molecules, we aim to use the derived isotopologue --- and hence oxygen
isotope --- ratios to put constraints on the masses of a sample of M-type AGB
stars that have not been classified as OH/IR stars. METHODS: We use detailed
radiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated lambda iteration method to
model the circumstellar molecular line emission of H$_2$$^{17}$O and
H$_2$$^{18}$O for IK Tau, R Dor, W Hya, and R Cas. The emission lines used to
constrain our models come from Herschel/HIFI and Herschel/PACS observations and
are all optically thick, meaning that full radiative transfer analysis is the
only viable method of estimating molecular abundance ratios. RESULTS: We find
generally low values of the $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio for our sample, ranging
from 0.15 to 0.69. This correlates with relatively low initial masses, in the
range $\sim1.0$ to 1.5 M$_\odot$ for each source, based on stellar evolutionary
models. We also find ortho-to-para ratios close to 3, which are expected from
warm formation predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratios found for
this sample are at the lower end of the range predicted by stellar evolutionary
models, indicating that the sample chosen had relatively low initial masses.

  $O(1/n)$- and $O(1/n^2)$-type of Risk Bounds",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although there exist plentiful theories of empirical risk minimization (ERM)
for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM for a
related problem---stochastic convex optimization (SCO), are limited. In this
work, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and
strong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an
$\widetilde{O}(d/n + \sqrt{F_*/n})$ risk bound when the random function is
nonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz
continuous, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number
of samples, and $F_*$ is the minimal risk. Thus, when $F_*$ is small we obtain
an $\widetilde{O}(d/n)$ risk bound, which is analogous to the
$\widetilde{O}(1/n)$ optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning. Second, if
the objective function is also $\lambda$-strongly convex, we prove an
$\widetilde{O}(d/n + \kappa F_*/n )$ risk bound where $\kappa$ is the condition
number, and improve it to $O(1/[\lambda n^2] + \kappa F_*/n)$ when
$n=\widetilde{\Omega}(\kappa d)$. As a result, we obtain an $O(\kappa/n^2)$
risk bound under the condition that $n$ is large and $F_*$ is small, which to
the best of our knowledge, is the first $O(1/n^2)$-type of risk bound of ERM.
Third, we stress that the above results are established in a unified framework,
which allows us to derive new risk bounds under weaker conditions, e.g.,
without convexity of the random function and Lipschitz continuity of the
expected function. Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an $O(1/[\lambda
n^2] + \kappa F_*/n)$ risk bound for supervised learning, the
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\kappa d)$ requirement on $n$ can be replaced with
$\Omega(\kappa^2)$, which is dimensionality-independent.

coordinated multi-point transmission network (JP-CoMP, a.k.a Network MIMO) in a
so-called distributed channel state information (D-CSI) setting. In the D-CSI
setting, the various transmitters (TXs) acquire a local, TX-dependent, estimate
of the global multi-user channel state matrix obtained via terminal feedback
and limited backhauling. The CSI noise across TXs can be independent or
correlated, so as to reflect the degree to which TXs can exchange information
over the backhaul, hence allowing to model a range of situations bridging fully
distributed and fully centralized CSI settings. In this context we aim to study
the price of CSI distributiveness in terms of sum rate at finite SNR when
compared with conventional centralized scenarios. We consider the family of
JP-CoMP precoders known as regularized zero-forcing (RZF). We conduct our study
in the large scale antenna regime, as it is currently envisioned to be used in
real 5G deployments. It is then possible to obtain accurate approximations on
so-called deterministic equivalents of the signal to interference and noise
ratios. Guided by the obtained deterministic equivalents, we propose an
approach to derive a RZF scheme that is robust to the distributed aspect of the
CSI, whereby the key idea lies in the optimization of a TX-dependent power
level and regularization factor. Our analysis confirms the improved robustness
of the proposed scheme with respect to CSI inconsistency at different TXs, even
with moderate number of antennas and receivers (RXs).

topological and conventional insulators. The main result is that two
interacting electrons can form bound states with the energy in the gap of the
band spectrum. The pairing mechanism can be interpreted as the formation of a
negative reduced effective mass of two electrons. The problem is complicated
because the relative motion of the electrons is coupled to the center-of-mass
motion. We consider the case of zero total momentum. Detail calculations are
carried out for the repulsive interaction potential of steplike form. The
states are classified according to their spin structure and two-particle basis
functions that form a given bound state. We analyze the spectra and electronic
structure of the bound states in the case of both topological and trivial
phases and especially focus on effects originating from the band inversion and
the coupling of the electron and hole bands. In the trivial phase and the
topological phase with the large coupling parameter $a$, the bound state
spectra are qualitatively similar. However, when $a$ is less a certain value,
the situation changes dramatically. In the topological phase, new states arise
with a higher binding energy at lower interaction potential, which evidences
that the band inversion can favor pairing the electrons.

electric quadrupole operator, which differs from an odd-parity electric dipole.
The lack of the inversion symmetry allows the even- and odd-parity mixing,
which leads to the electric dipole described by the electric quadruple

of exoplanetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission
spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission
spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a
reference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We
show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius,
the assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the
inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC3 transmission
spectrum. Second, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal
atmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric
analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical
calculations and show that the typical errors are ~0.1% (~10 ppm) within the
WFC3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Third, we
generalize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small
temperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC3 transmission
spectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the
retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the reference transit radius
and reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional
relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure
implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure
that is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone.
This degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract
molecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC3 data alone. Finally,
we compare our study to that of Griffith (2014) and discuss why the degeneracy
was missed in previous retrieval studies. [abridged]

in scenarios where models need to be adapted to a large number of domains or

to study Type Ia SNe and shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs). The present state
of knowledge about SN 1006 is reviewed in this article. No star consistent with
a surviving companion expected in the traditional single-degenerate scenario
has been found, which favors a double-degenerate scenario for the progenitor of
SN 1006. Both unshocked and shocked SN ejecta have been probed through
absorption lines in ultraviolet spectra of background sources and thermal X-ray
emission, respectively. The absorption studies suggest that the amount of iron
is < 0.16 M_sun, which is significantly less than the range for normal SNe Ia.
On the other hand, analyses of X-ray data reveal the distribution of shocked
ejecta to be highly asymmetric especially for iron. Therefore, most of iron
might have escaped from the ultraviolet background sources. Another important
aspect with SN 1006 is that it was the first SNR in which synchrotron X-ray
emission was detected from shells of the remnant, providing evidence that
electrons are accelerated up to ~100 TeV energies at forward shocks. The
bilateral symmetry of the synchrotron emission (bright in northeastern and
southwestern limbs) is likely due to a polar cap geometry. The broadband
(radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray) spectral energy distribution suggests that the
gamma-ray emission is predominantly leptonic. At the northwestern shock,
evidence for extreme, but less than mass proportional, temperature
non-equilibration has been found by optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray
observations.

scattering and coupling rates of slab resonances to be altered over a broad
range of evanescent wavevectors. We conclude that while the radiative flux
between two inhomogeneous slabs can only be weakly enhanced, the flux between a
dipolar particle and an inhomogeneous slab---proportional to the local density
of states---can be orders of magnitude larger, albeit at the expense of
increased frequency selectivity. A brief discussion of hyperbolic metamaterials
shows that they provide far less enhancement than optimized inhomogeneous

are common around solar-type stars, but their period ratios do not show strong
pile-ups near mean motion resonances (MMRs). One scenario is that super-Earths
form in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding
gas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,
that planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential
migration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,
we seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the
orbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas
disk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets
can escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the
planet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas
disk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding
magnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.
Migration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the
outer planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two
planets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner
planet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the
initial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping
their migration at longer periods. We highlight \textit{magnetospheric rebound}
as an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with
observations. Even when planets are trapped into MMR during the early gas-rich
stage, subsequent cavity expansion would induce substantial changes to their
orbits, moving them out of resonance.

from the external actuator to the distal joint. However, nonlinearities from
friction and backlash hysteresis between the tendon and the sheath pose
challenges in achieving precise position controls of the end effector. Previous

This paper presents a new approach to model and control the TSM-driven flexible

the halo mass function; ii) halo mass density profiles; iii) the halo
mass-concentration relation; iv) the clustering of haloes; and v) the
clustering of matter; and we explore the extent to which the effects of baryon
physics and neutrino free-streaming can be treated independently. Consistent
with previous studies, we find that both AGN feedback and neutrino
free-streaming suppress the total matter power spectrum, although their scale
and redshift dependencies differ significantly. The inclusion of AGN feedback
can significantly reduce the masses of groups and clusters, and increase their
scale radii. These effects lead to a decrease in the amplitude of the
mass-concentration relation and an increase in the halo autocorrelation
function at fixed mass. Neutrinos also lower the masses of groups and clusters
while having no significant effect on the shape of their density profiles (thus
also affecting the mass-concentration relation and halo clustering in a
qualitatively similar way to feedback). We show that, with only a small number
of exceptions, the combined effects of baryon physics and neutrino
free-streaming on all five diagnostics can be estimated to typically better

exhibits a wide range of nonlinear phenomena including a dramatic increase in
the viscosity \cite{1-3} with increasing stress. If the volume fraction of the
solid phase is moderately high, the suspension will undergo continuous shear
thickening (CST), where the suspension viscosity increases smoothly with
applied shear stress; at still higher volume fractions the suspension can
display discontinuous shear thickening (DST), where the viscosity changes
abruptly over several orders of magnitude upon increasing applied stress.
Proposed models to explain this phenomenon are based in two distinct types of
particle interactions, hydrodynamic\cite{2,4,5} and frictional\cite{6-10}. In
both cases, the increase in the bulk viscosity is attributed to some form of
localized clustering\cite{11,12}. However, the physical properties and
dynamical behavior of these heterogeneities remains unclear. Here we show that
continuous shear thickening originates from dynamic localized well defined
regions of particles with a high viscosity that increases rapidly with
concentration. Furthermore, we find that the spatial extent of these regions is
largely determined by the distance between the shearing surfaces. Our results
demonstrate that continuous shear thickening arises from increasingly frequent
localized discontinuous transitions between coexisting low and high viscosity
Newtonian fluid phases. Our results provide a critical physical link between
the microscopic dynamical processes that determine particle interactions and
bulk rheological response of shear thickened fluids.

for the evolution of sex; bisexual reproduction emerged only among anisogamic
diploids with a synergistic division of reproductive labor; and facultative sex
was more likely to evolve among haploids practicing assortative mating. Looking
at the evolution of sex as a complex system through individual based
simulations, explains better the diversity of sexual strategies known to exist
in nature, compared to classical analytical models

The rank number of $G$ is defined to be the smallest $k$ such that $G$ has a
$k$-ranking. We find the largest possible directed graph that can be obtained
from a directed path or a directed cycle by attaching new edges to the vertices
such that the new graphs have the same rank number as the original graphs. The
adjacency matrix of the resulting graph is embedded in the Sierpi\'nski
triangle.
  We present a connection between the number of edges that can be added to

generalized to create directed graphs which are unions of directed paths and
directed cycles that maintain the rank number of a base graph of a directed

function of the detectors. Radioactive line sources can be deployed around the

measuring in low-background mode, these line sources have to be stored outside
the shielding so they do not contribute to the background. The deployment and
the retraction of the source are designed to be controlled by the data
acquisition system and do not require any direct human interaction. In this

this method also provides a wealth of information to reason about in the

the classic kernelization rules often correspond to dominance rather than
consistency, we introduce the notion of ""loss-less"" kernel. While our

low-dimensional nanostructures. Recently, both phenomena have been reported in
bilinear Josephson junction arrays. These devices provide a unique opportunity
to study the interplay of Coulomb drag and depinning in a system where all
relevant parameters can be controlled experimentally. We explain the Coulomb
drag and depinning characteristics in the I-V curve of the bilinear Josephson
junction array by adopting a quasicharge model which has previously proven
useful in describing threshold phenomena in linear Josephson junction arrays.
Simulations are performed for a range of coupling strengths, where numerically
obtained I-V curves match well with what has been previously observed
experimentally. Analytic expressions for the ratio between the active and
passive currents are derived from depinning arguments. Novel phenomena are
predicted at voltages higher than those for which experimental results have

require a deeper semantic understanding and a novel text generation for the
data. Although the recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be used to model the
context of the time-sequences, in most cases the long-term dependencies of
multi-modal data make the back-propagation through time training of RNN tend to
vanish in the time domain. Recently, inspired from Multiple Time-scale
Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN), an extension of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
called Multiple Time-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (MTGRU), has been proposed to
learn the long-term dependencies in natural language processing. Particularly
it is also able to accomplish the abstraction task for paragraphs given that
the time constants are well defined. In this paper, we compare the MTRNN and
MTGRU in terms of its learning performances as well as their abstraction
representation on higher level (with a slower neural activation). This was done
by conducting two studies based on a smaller data- set (two-dimension time
sequences from non-linear functions) and a relatively large data-set
(43-dimension time sequences from iCub manipulation tasks with multi-modal
data). We conclude that gated recurrent mechanisms may be necessary for
learning long-term dependencies in large dimension multi-modal data-sets (e.g.
learning of robot manipulation), even when natural language commands was not
involved. But for smaller learning tasks with simple time-sequences, generic
version of recurrent models, such as MTRNN, were sufficient to accomplish the
abstraction task.
