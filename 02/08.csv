Turakulov that differs from the Li\'enard-Wiechert one and which according to

implications of both solutions concerning the validity of the Equivalence

so-called Bell's ""paradox"" which is as yet source of misunderstandings and the
Unruh effect, which according to its standard derivation in the majority of the

standard derivation of the Unruh effect does not resist any tentative of any
rigorous mathematical investigation, in particular the one based in the
algebraic approach to field theory which we also recall. These results make us
to align with some researchers that also conclude that the Unruh effect does
not exist.

multiple biological processes of the parasite, and thus might contribute to
parasite death and CQ resistance. Recently, we found that CQ induced one of

Kuiper belt can be very well reproduced if before the onset of the planetary
instability Neptune underwent a long-range planetesimal-driven migration up to
$\sim$28 au. However, considering that all giant planets should have been
captured in mean motion resonances among themselves during the gas-disk phase,
it is not clear whether such a very specific evolution for Neptune is possible,
nor whether the instability could have happened at late times. Here, we first
investigate which initial resonant configuration of the giant planets can be
compatible with Neptune being extracted from the resonant chain and migrating
to $\sim$28 au before that the planetary instability happened. We address the
late instability issue by investigating the conditions where the planets can
stay in resonance for about 400 My. Our results indicate that this can happen
only in the case where the planetesimal disk is beyond a specific minimum
distance $\delta_{stab}$ from Neptune. Then, if there is a sufficient amount of
dust produced in the planetesimal disk, that drifts inwards, Neptune can enter
in a slow dust-driven migration phase for hundreds of Mys until it reaches a
critical distance $\delta_{mig}$ from the disk. From that point, faster
planetesimal-driven migration takes over and Neptune continues migrating
outward until the instability happens. We conclude that, although an early
instability reproduces more easily the evolution of Neptune required to explain
the structure of the Kuiper belt, such evolution is also compatible with a late
instability.

In this paper, we present the renewed results for the $J/\psi$ production in
DIS at HERA within the nonrelativistic QCD framework at QCD leading order (LO).
Three different sets of the long-distance matrix elements are employed for
comparison. The predictions via the colour-singlet (CS) model at QCD LO are
generally below the experimental data especially in the regions where
perturbation theory are expected to work well, while the colour-octet
contributions are of the same order of magnitude as the CS ones, however, in
general make the agreement between theory and experiment better.

large-volume traffic, faster methods are paramount to saving time and energy
costs. Recent advances in GPU hardware have led to the emergence of
bi-directional LSTMs as a standard method for obtaining per-token vector
representations serving as input to labeling tasks such as NER (often followed
by prediction in a linear-chain CRF). Though expressive and accurate, these
models fail to fully exploit GPU parallelism, limiting their computational
efficiency. This paper proposes a faster alternative to Bi-LSTMs for NER:
Iterated Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (ID-CNNs), which have better
capacity than traditional CNNs for large context and structured prediction.
Unlike LSTMs whose sequential processing on sentences of length N requires O(N)
time even in the face of parallelism, ID-CNNs permit fixed-depth convolutions
to run in parallel across entire documents. We describe a distinct combination
of network structure, parameter sharing and training procedures that enable
dramatic 14-20x test-time speedups while retaining accuracy comparable to the
Bi-LSTM-CRF. Moreover, ID-CNNs trained to aggregate context from the entire
document are even more accurate while maintaining 8x faster test time speeds.

show many examples of models with negative weights which map to models with
only positive weights. Using the algebraic invariant relations of the even and

plane of the square lattice Ising model in a field which map to the even or odd

invariants do not fully exhaust the possible mappings a model may have with

  RQI should converge in fewer iterations than power iteration (PI) for large

on small-scales. This {\it fuzzy dark matter} component is commonly assumed to
arise as the consequence of a new axion-like particle in the matter sector, yet
for simplicity it is usually modeled in terms of a simple free quadratic field.
In this paper we consider how the cosmological constraints are modified when
the effects of an instanton potential and temperature-dependent mass are
included. Current isocurvature and tensor bounds confirms that this particle
should be formed before the end of a low-scale inflation period with Hubble
parameter $H_I\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{12}\,\textrm{GeV}$, in accordance with
previous free-field analysis. The axion decay constant, $f_a$, which fixes
axion couplings, appears in the instanton potential and determines the relic
abundance, the stability of galaxy cores to axion emission, and the direct
searches of fuzzy dark matter. If the axion mass is $T$-independent, we find
that $f_a\gtrsim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}$ is required in order to reach the
observed relic density without fine tuning the initial conditions, while for a
$T$-dependent case this bound can be lowered by an order of magnitude. However,
the anharmonicities in the instanton potential, and mainly a $T$-dependent
mass, can delay the onset of field oscillations, leading to larger physical
suppression scales in the matter power spectrum for a fixed zero-temperature
axion mass. This may favor a string or accidental axion over one emerging from
a strongly coupled gauge sector if this model is required to provide large
galactic halo cores while simultaneously satisfying observational constraints

Virgo galaxies near their centres, resulting in higher H$_{2}$ to HI ratios and
steeper H$_{2}$ and total gas radial profiles. This is likely due to the
effects of moderate ram pressure stripping in the cluster environment, which
would preferentially remove low density gas in the outskirts while enhancing
higher density gas near the centre. Combined with H$\alpha$ star formation rate

enhanced at the magnetic fields corresponding to full occupancy of the Landau
levels in the shallow band. This enhancement is especially pronounced for the
lowest Landau level. As a consequence, the reentrant superconducting regions in
the temperature-field phase diagram emerge at low temperatures near the
magnetic fields at which the chemical potential matches the Landau levels. The
specific behavior depends on the relative strength of the intraband and
interband pairing interactions and the reentrance is most pronounced in the
purely interband coupling scenario. The reentrant behavior is suppressed by the
Zeeman spin splitting in the shallow band, the separated regions disappear
already for very small spin-splitting factors. On the other hand, the
reentrance is restored in the resonance cases when the spin-splitting energy
exactly matches the separation between the Landau levels. The predicted
behavior may realize in the gate-tuned FeSe monolayer.

show that $1 \rightarrow 3$ optimal cloner does a better job at broadcasting

bring out the fundamental difference between the tasks of cloning and

surpass the best possible range obtained using existing cloning machines

describe filaments having no core, one low-mass core, and one cluster-forming

constant-density surface of finite extent. In contrast to 1D Plummer-like
models, they have specific values of length and mass, they approximate observed

core-filament system, by identifying the zone of gas dense enough to form
low-mass stars, and by counting the number of enclosed thermal Jeans masses.
This analysis suggests that the Musca Center filament may be near the start of

while the Coronet filament is near the midpoint of its star formation, with
enough dense gas to add ~ 8 protostars to its ~20 known stars. In contrast L43

  We study four discretisation schemes that extract information about level
sets of planar Gaussian fields. Each scheme recovers information up to a
different level of precision, and each requires a maximum mesh-size in order to
be valid with high probability. The first two schemes are generalisations and
enhancements of similar schemes that have appeared in the literature [BG16,

either a local or global scale. As an application, we improve the results in
[BG16] on Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the nodal set of
positively-correlated planar Gaussian fields. The third and fourth schemes are,
to the best of our knowledge, completely new. The third scheme is specific to
the nodal set of the random plane wave, and provides global topological
information about the nodal set up to `visible ambiguities'. The fourth scheme
gives a way to approximate the mean number of excursion domains of planar

on the low-to-moderate eccentricity regime, but with new discoveries of high
eccentricity resonant minor planets and even exoplanets, there is increasing
motivation to examine MMRs in the high eccentricity regime. Here we report on a
study of the high eccentricity regime of MMRs in the circular planar restricted
three-body problem. Non-perturbative numerical analyses of the 2:1 and the 3:2
interior resonances are carried out for a wide range of secondary-to-primary
mass ratio, and for a wide range of eccentricity of the test particle. The
surface-of-section technique is used to study the phase space structure near
resonances. We identify transitions in phase space at certain critical
eccentricities related to the geometry of resonant orbits; new stable libration
zones appear at high eccentricity at libration centers shifted from those at
low eccentricities. We present novel results on the mass and eccentricity
dependence of the resonance libration centers and their widths in semi-major
axis. Our results show that MMRs have sizable libration zones at high
eccentricities, comparable to those at lower eccentricities.

density estimation, for example literally fitting a polynomial (or Fourier
series) to the sample, which coefficients are calculated by just averaging
monomials (or sine/cosine) over the sample. Another discussed basic application
is fitting distortion to some standard distribution like Gaussian - analogously
to ICA, but additionally allowing to reconstruct the disturbed density.
Finally, by using weighted average, it can be also applied for estimation of
non-probabilistic densities, like modelling mass distribution, or for various
clustering problems by using negative (or complex) weights: fitting a function
which sign (or argument) determines clusters. The estimated parameters are
approaching the optimal values with error dropping like $1/\sqrt{n}$, where $n$

the microstructure with the macro-mechanical parameters of biotissues. The

However, to date the existence of these species of black holes remains
ambiguous and their formation process is therefore unknown. It has been long
suspected that black holes with masses $10^{2}-10^{4}M_{\odot}$ should form and
reside in dense stellar systems. Therefore, dedicated observational campaigns
have targeted globular cluster for many decades searching for signatures of
these elusive objects. All candidates found in these targeted searches appear
radio dim and do not have the X-ray to radio flux ratio predicted by the
fundamental plane for accreting black holes. Based on the lack of an
electromagnetic counterpart upper limits of $2060 M_{\odot}$ and $470
M_{\odot}$ have been placed on the mass of a putative black hole in 47 Tucanae

evidence for a central black hole in 47 Tuc with a mass of M$_{\bullet}\sim2300

and therefore contrary to expectations is gas starved. This intermediate mass
black hole might be a member of electromagnetically invisible population of
black holes that are the elusive seeds leading to the formation of supermassive
black holes in galaxies.

using linear basis models to account for the systematics. Our results further
demonstrate the use of ground-based multi-object spectrographs for the study of

well-understood. Streaming instability is a promising mechanism to directly
form planetesimals from pebble-sized particles, provided a high enough
solids-to-gas ratio. However, local enhancements of the solids-to-gas ratio are
difficult to realize in a smooth disk, which motivates the consideration of
special disk locations such as the snowline. In this article we investigate the
viability of planetesimal formation by streaming instability near the snowline
due to water diffusion and condensation. We adopt a viscous disk model, and
numerically solve the transport equations for vapor and solids on a
cylindrical, 1D grid. We take into account radial drift of solids, gas
accretion on to the central star, and turbulent diffusion. We study the
importance of the back-reaction of solids on the gas and of the radial
variation of the mean molecular weight of the gas. We find that water diffusion
and condensation can locally enhance the ice surface density by a factor 3--5
outside the snowline. Assuming that icy pebbles contain many micron-sized
silicate grains that are released during evaporation, the enhancement is
increased by another factor $\sim$$2$. In this `many-seeds' model, the
solids-to-gas ratio interior to the snowline is enhanced as well, but not as
much as just outside the snowline. In the context of a viscous disk, the
diffusion-condensation mechanism is most effective for high values of the
turbulence parameter $\alpha$ ($10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$). Therefore, assuming young
disks are more vigorously turbulent than older disks, planetesimals near the
snowline can form in an early stage of the disk. In highly turbulent disks,
tens of Earth masses can be stored in an annulus outside the snowline, which
can be identified with recent ALMA observations.

about their birth multiplicity properties. Here, we investigate the strikingly
low radial-velocity dispersion measured for a sample of 11 massive pre- and
near-main-sequence stars (sigma_rv = 5.6 +/- 0.2 km/s) in the young massive
star forming region M17 to obtain first constraints on the multiplicity
properties of young massive stellar objects. Methods: We compute the RV
dispersion of synthetic populations of massive stars for various multiplicity
properties and we compare the simulated sigma_rv distributions to the observed
value. We specifically investigate two scenarios: a low binary fraction and a
dearth of short-period binary systems. Results: Simulated populations with low
binary fractions (f_bin = 0.12_{-0.09}^{+0.16}) or with truncated period
distributions (P_cutoff > 9 months) are able to reproduce the low sigma_rv
observed within their 68%-confidence intervals. Parent populations with f_bin >
0.42 or P_cutoff < 47 d can however be rejected at the 5%-significance level.
Both constraints are contrast with the high binary fraction and plethora of
short-period systems found in few Myr-old, OB-type populations. To explain the
difference, the first scenario requires a variation of the outcome of the
massive star formation process. In the the second scenario, compact binaries
must form later on, and the cut-off period may be related to physical
length-scales representative of the bloated pre-main-sequence stellar radii or
of their accretion disks. Conclusions: If the obtained constraints are
representative of the overall properties of massive young stellar objects, our
results may provide support to a formation process in which binaries are
initially formed at larger separations, then harden or migrate to produce the
typical (untruncated) power-law period distribution observed in few Myr-old OB
binaries.

offers the first test on the presence of a WHIM near the typical accretion
shock radius ($\sim 2r_{200}$) predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. For the
2.2-3.3 Mpc region, the spectral fit significantly (99.2% significance)
improved when we include OVII and OVIII lines in the spectral model. A
comparable WHIM surface brightness was obtained in the 3.3-4.4 Mpc region and
the redshift of OVIII line is consistent with $z=0.3$ within errors. The
present results support that the observed soft X-ray emission originated from
the WHIM. However, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties,
OVIII detection in the northeast regions was marginal. The surface brightness
of the OVIII line in ${\rm 10^{-7} photons\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}arcmin^{-2}}$ was
measured to be $2.7\pm 1.0$, $2.1 \pm 1.2$ for the 2.2-3.3, 3.3-4.4 Mpc
regions, giving the upper limit on the baryon overdensity of $\delta = 319
(<443)$, $283 (<446)$, respectively. This is comparable with previous
observations of cluster outskirts and their theoretical predictions. The future
prospect for WHIM detection using the Athena X-IFU micro-calorimeter is briefly
discussed here. In addition, we also derived the ICM temperature distribution
of A2744 to detect a clear discontinuity at the location of the radio relic.

$\mathcal{D}_2(r)$ reaches 3 within $1\%$, i.e. $\mathcal{D}_2(r)>2.97$ for
$r>\mathcal{R}_H$, we find $\mathcal{R}_H = (63.3\pm0.7) \ h^{-1}\
\mathrm{Mpc}$, in agreement at the percentage level with the predictions of the
$\Lambda$CDM model $\mathcal{R}_H=62.0\ h^{-1}\ \mathrm{Mpc}$. Thanks to the
large cosmic depth of the survey, we investigate the redshift evolution of the
transition to homogeneity scale and find agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM
prediction. Finally, we find that $\mathcal{D}_2$ is compatible with $3$ at
scales larger than $300\ h^{-1}\ $Mpc in all redshift bins.
  These results consolidate the Cosmological Principle and represent a precise
consistency test of the $\Lambda CDM$ model.

Miller-Jones et al. (2015) recently identified a radio counterpart to X9

simultaneous observations of X9 performed by Chandra, Nustar and Australia
Telescope Compact Array. We find a clear 28.18$\pm$0.02 min periodic modulation
in the Chandra data, which we identify as the orbital period, confirming this
system as an ultracompact X-ray binary. Our X-ray spectral fitting provides
evidence for photoionized gas having a high oxygen abundance in this system,
which indicates a C/O white dwarf donor. We also identify reflection features
in the hard X-ray spectrum, making X9 the faintest LMXB to show X-ray
reflection. We detect a $\sim$ 6.8 day modulation in the X-ray brightness by a
factor of 10, in archival Chandra, Swift, and Rosat data. The simultaneous
radio/X-ray flux ratio is consistent with either a black hole primary or a
neutron star primary, if the neutron star is a transitional millisecond pulsar.
Considering the measured orbital period (with other evidence of a white dwarf
donor), and the lack of transitional millisecond pulsar features in the X-ray
light curve, we suggest that this could be the first ultracompact black hole
X-ray binary identified in our Galaxy.

the presence of a perfect fluid. The generalization comes through the channel
that the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega$ is allowed to be a function of
the scalar field $\phi$. This generalization can lead to a host of
scalar-tensor theories of gravity for various choices of $\omega = \omega
(\phi)$. A very interesting general result has been found. Excepting for the
case of a radiation distribution as the choice of the fluid, all other
solutions find a natural habitat in the corresponding solutions in general
relativity in an infinite $\omega$ limit. For the radiation distribution, the
dependence of stability on $\omega$ is a bit obscure. If a scalar potential,
function of the Brans-Dicke scalar field, is added to the action, the
requirement of an infinite $\omega$ for stability is relaxed for a matter
distribution with a non-zero trace whereas it becomes a possibility for a
radiation distribution.

overtone pulsators (RRc stars). In two stars, previously identified as RRab, V3
and V34, we detect additional periodicity identified as radial first overtone
mode. Lower than usual period ratios (0.730 and 0.728), dominant pulsation in
the radial fundamental mode and presence of a long-period modulation indicate,
that these two variables are not classical RRd stars, but are new members of
the recently identified class of anomalous RRd variables. In a significant
fraction of RRc stars, 63 per cent, we detect additional shorter-period
variability in the (0.60, 0.65)$P_1$ range. This form of double-periodic
pulsation must be common in first overtone RR Lyr stars, as space observations
indicate. The incidence rate we find in NGC 6362, is the highest in
ground-based observations reported so far. We study the properties of these
stars in detail; in particular we confirm that in the colour-magnitude diagram,
this group is adjacent to the interface between RRab and RRc stars, as first
reported in the analysis of M3 observations by Jurcsik et al. The incidence
rate of the Blazhko effect is also very high: we observe it in 69 per cent of
RRab stars and in 19 per cent of RRc stars. Rare, double-periodic modulation is
reported in one RRab and in one RRc star. Finally we discuss V37 - a peculiar

consistency of millisecond pulsars to measure low frequency gravitational waves
from (super)Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries. We use comprehensive MBH merger
models based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to predict the spectrum
of the stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (GWB). We use real
Time-of-Arrival (TOA) specifications from the European, NANOGrav, Parkes, and
International PTA (IPTA) to calculate realistic times to detection of the GWB
across a wide range of model parameters. In addition to exploring the parameter
space of environmental hardening processes (in particular: stellar scattering
efficiencies), we have expanded our models to include eccentric binary
evolution which can have a strong effect on the GWB spectrum. Our models show
that strong stellar scattering and high characteristic eccentricities enhance
the GWB strain amplitude near the PTA sensitive ""sweet-spot"" (near the
frequency $f = 1 \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), slightly improving detection prospects
in these cases. While the GWB $amplitude$ is degenerate between cosmological
and environmental parameters, the location of a spectral turnover at low
frequencies ($f \lesssim 0.1 \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) is strongly indicative of
environmental coupling. At high frequencies ($f\gtrsim 1 \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$),
the GWB spectral index can be used to infer the number density of sources and
possibly their eccentricity distribution. Even with merger models that use
pessimistic environmental and eccentricity parameters, if the current rate of
PTA expansion continues, we find that the International PTA is highly likely to
make a detection within about 10 years.

problems in a variety of domains, including natural language (parse trees) and
cheminformatics (molecular graphs). However, since the computation graph has a
different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support
batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular
deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We
introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together
operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between
different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create
static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs
of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of
compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models.
Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel
implementations for a variety of models from the literature.

due to their low luminosity and low number density compared to the stars in the
discs of the Milky Way, they are scarce in the observable volume. Hence, they
are still poorly understood one hundred years after their discovery as
relatively few have been observed. They are crucial to the understanding of
several fundamental properties of the Galaxy {\mdash} the geometry, kinematics
and star formation history, as well as to the study of the end-stage of stellar
evolution for low- and intermediate-mass stars. White dwarfs were traditionally
identified by their ultraviolet (UV) excess, however, if they have cooled for a
long time, they become so faint in that part of the spectrum that they cannot
be seen by the most sensitive modern detectors. Proper motion was then used as
a means to identify white dwarf candidates, due to their relatively large space
motions compared to other objects with the same colour. The use of proper
motion as a selection criterion has proven effective and has yielded large
samples of candidates with the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey and Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. In this work I will further increase the sample size with the

is the process of cluster formation slow and hydrostatic or quick and dynamic?
We link the physical properties of high-mass star-forming regions with their
evolutionary stage in a systematic way, using Herschel and Spitzer data. In
order to produce a robust estimate of the relative lifetimes of these regions,
we compare the fraction of dense, molecular regions above a column density
associated with high-mass star formation, N(H2) > 0.4-2.5 x 10^22 cm^-2, in the
'starless (no signature of stars > 10 Msun forming) and star-forming phases in
a 2x2 degree region of the Galactic Plane centered at l=30deg. Of regions
capable of forming high-mass stars on ~1 pc scales, the starless (or embedded
beyond detection) phase occupies about 60-70% of the dense, molecular region
lifetime and the star-forming phase occupies about 30-40%. These relative
lifetimes are robust over a wide range of thresholds. We outline a method by
which relative lifetimes can be anchored to absolute lifetimes from large-scale
surveys of methanol masers and UCHII regions. A simplistic application of this
method estimates the absolute lifetimes of the starless phase to be 0.2-1.7 Myr
(about 0.6-4.1 fiducial cloud free-fall times) and the star-forming phase to be
0.1-0.7 Myr (about 0.4-2.4 free-fall times), but these are highly uncertain.
This work uniquely investigates the star-forming nature of high-column density

and polarized radio continuum intensity from 0.408-353 GHz. The high-frequency

suggesting a different physical origin. Portions of the 1.5 GHz Fan Region
emission are depolarized by about 30% by ionized gas structures in the Perseus

argue for the same conclusion based on the high polarization fraction at 1.5
GHz (about 40%). The Fan Region is offset with respect to the Galactic plane,
covering -5{\deg} < b < +10{\deg}; we attribute this offset to the warp in the
outer Galaxy. We discuss origins of the polarized emission, including the
spiral Galactic magnetic field. This idea is a plausible contributing factor
although no model to date readily reproduces all of the observations. We
conclude that models of the Galactic magnetic field should account for the > 1

The resonator impedance is significantly smaller than the practically

promises approximately two orders of magnitude increase in the local magnetic

We show that by using niobium (aluminum) as the resonator's superconductor and
a single phosphorous (bismuth) atom as the donor, a coupling rate of
$g/2\pi$=0.24 MHz (0.39 MHz) can be achieved in the single photon regime. For
this hybrid cavity quantum electrodynamic system, such enhancement in $g$ is

stellar surface, that cause modulation of a few percent in the light curve of
the star as it rotates. When a planet eclipses its host star, it might cross in
front of one of these spots creating a ""bump"" in the transit light curve. By
modelling these spot signatures, it is possible to determine the physical
properties of the spots such as size, temperature, and location. In turn, the
monitoring of the spots longitude provides estimates of the stellar rotation
and differential rotation. This technique was applied to the star Kepler-17, a
solar--type star orbited by a hot Jupiter. The model yields the following spot
characteristics: average radius of $49 \pm 10$ Mm, temperatures of $5100 \pm
300$ K, and surface area coverage of $6 \pm 4$ \%. The rotation period at the
transit latitude, $-5^\circ$, occulted by the planet was found to be $11.92 \pm
0.05$ d, slightly smaller than the out--of--transit average period of $12.4 \pm
0.1$ d. Adopting a solar like differential rotation, we estimated the
differential rotation of Kepler-17 to be $\Delta\Omega = 0.041 \pm 0.005$ rd/d,
which is close to the solar value of 0.050 rd/d, and a relative differential
rotation of $\Delta\Omega/\Omega=8.0 \pm 0.9$ \%. Since Kepler-17 is much more
active than our Sun, it appears that for this star larger rotation rate is more
effective in the generation of magnetic fields than shear.

studies with modern computational science models that contain several input
parameters. In statistical regression, techniques for sufficient dimension
reduction (SDR) use data to reduce the predictor dimension of a regression
problem. A computational scientist hoping to use SDR for parameter reduction
encounters a problem: a computer prediction is best represented by a
deterministic function of the inputs, so data comprised of computer simulation
queries fail to satisfy the SDR assumptions. To address this problem, we
interpret SDR methods sliced inverse regression (SIR) and sliced average
variance estimation (SAVE) as estimating the directions of a ridge function,
which is a composition of a low-dimensional linear transformation with a
nonlinear function. Within this interpretation, SIR and SAVE estimate matrices
of integrals whose column spaces are contained in the ridge directions' span;
we analyze and numerically verify convergence of these column spaces as the
number of computer model queries increases. Moreover, we show example functions
that are not ridge functions but whose inverse conditional moment matrices are
low-rank. Consequently, the computational scientist should beware when using
SIR and SAVE for parameter reduction, since SIR and SAVE may mistakenly suggest
that truly important directions are unimportant.

metallicities and IMF upper mass limits. Using CLOUDY we compute and include in
the SSP spectra the neb- ular emission contribution. We also revisit the
thermal and non-thermal radio emission contribution from young stars. Using
GRASIL we can thus predict the panchromatic spectrum and the main recombination
lines of any type of star-forming galaxy, including the effects of dust
absorption and re-emission. We check the new models against the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of selected well-observed nearby galaxies. From the
best-fit models we obtain a consistent set of star formation rate (SFR)
calibrations at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to radio. We also
provide analytical calibrations that take into account the dependence on
metallcity and IMF upper mass limit of the SSPs. We show that the latter limit
can be well constrained by combining information from the observed far
infrared, 24 {\mu}m, 33 GHz and H{\alpha} luminosities. Another interesting
property derived from the fits is that, while in a normal galaxy the
attenuation in the lines is significantly higher than that in the nearby
continuum, in individual star bursting regions they are similar, supporting the
notion that this effect is due to an age selective extinction. Since in these
conditions the Balmer decrement method may not be accurate, we provide
relations to estimate the attenuation from the observed 24 {\mu}m or 33 GHz
fluxes. These relations can be useful for the analysis of young high redshift

because it ignores additional information available in the data. The zero
initial condition is trivially satisfied by subtracting initial observations
from the data. We show that differencing out the data further erodes efficiency
compared to drawing inference conditional on the first observations.
  Finally, we compare the conditional method with standard random effects
approaches for unobserved data. Standard approaches implicitly rely on normal
approximations, which may not be reliable when unobserved data is very skewed
with some mass at zero values. For example, panel data on firms naturally
depend on the first period in which the firm enters on a new state. It seems
unreasonable then to assume that the process determining unobserved data is

establish the local convergence under appropriate conditions and show that the
proposed method, geometrically, finds the solution by searching along the
surface corresponding to one component of the nonlinear problem. We will
demonstrate the robustness of the method on various numerical examples,
including: (1) A six-moment one-dimensional entropy problem with an explicit
solution that contains components of order $10^0-10^3$ in magnitude; (2)
Four-moment multidimensional entropy problems with explicit solutions where the
resulting systems to be solved ranging from $70-310$ equations; (3) Four- to
eight-moment of a two-dimensional entropy problem, which solutions correspond
to the densities of the two leading EOFs of the wind stress-driven large-scale

(4) Four-moment constrained of up to five-dimensional entropy problems which
solutions correspond to multidimensional densities of the components of the
solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. For the higher dimensional
cases of this example, the EBE method is superior because it automatically
selects a subset of the prescribed moment constraints from which the maximum

feature is particularly important since the moment constrained maximum entropy
problems do not necessarily have solutions in general.

to two such sequences: it says that the preference ranking of the delayed

such that one strict ranking prevails for shorter delays and the opposite
strict ranking for longer delays. For preferences that have a discounted
utility (DU) representation, Bell (1988) argues that the only discount

This paper proves that discount functions of the linear times exponential form
also satisfy the one-switch property. We further demonstrate that preferences
which have a DU representation with a linear times exponential discount
function exhibit increasing impatience (Takeuchi (2011)). We also clarify an
ambiguity in the original Bell (1988) definition of the one-switch property by
distinguishing a weak one-switch property from the (strong) one-switch

Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). In this paper, we exploit the new

read-only data cache, warp-shuffle, and cross-warp atomic techniques. We report
a 3-fold speed-up over our previous implementation of this filtering technique.
To tackle SPIIR with relatively few filters, we develop a new GPU thread

multi-rate scheme of SPIIR filtering using Maxwell GPUs. We achieve more than

can generalize to every plausible human 3D pose. Removing the model bias
intrinsically helps to generate more diverse 3D pose hypotheses. We argue that
generating multiple pose hypotheses is more reasonable than generating only a
single 3D pose based on the 2D joint detection given the depth ambiguity and
the uncertainty due to occlusion and imperfect 2D joint detection. We hope that
the idea of generating multiple consistent pose hypotheses can give rise to a
new line of future work that has not received much attention in the literature.

for any closed, oriented $3$-manifold $Y$ via the symplectic geometry of
so-called traceless $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-character varieties. This invariant,
$\mathrm{SI}(Y)$, which we refer to as the symplectic instanton homology of
$Y$, was also shown to satisfy an exact triangle for Dehn surgeries on knots
which is typical of Floer-theoretic invariants of $3$-manifolds.
  In this article, we demonstrate further structural properties of this
symplectic instanton homology. For example, Floer theories are expected to
roughly satisfy the axioms of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), so
that in particular they should be functorial with respect to cobordisms.
Following a strategy used by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o in the context of Heegaard
Floer homology, we prove that our theory is functorial with respect to
connected $4$-dimensional cobordisms, so that cobordisms induce homomorphisms
between symplectic instanton homologies. We also generalize the surgery exact
triangle by proving that Dehn surgeries on a link $L$ in a $3$-manifold $Y$
induce a spectral sequence of symplectic instanton homologies -- the $E^2$-page
is isomorphic to a direct sum of symplectic instanton homologies of all
possible combinations of $0$- and $1$-surgeries on the components of $L$, and
the spectral sequence converges to $\mathrm{SI}(Y)$. For the branched double
cover $\Sigma(L)$ of a link $L \subset S^3$, we show there is a link surgery
spectral sequence whose $E^2$-page is isomorphic to the reduced Khovanov
homology of $L$ and which converges to the symplectic instanton homology of
$\Sigma(L)$.

moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ
a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. We then
collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and
attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally,
we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis
to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our
rule-based cohort identification technique collected 53,820 users over thirty
months from Twitter. Our pregnancy announcement classification technique
achieved an F-measure of 0.81 for the pregnancy class, resulting in 34,895 user

data. Our approach to using user timelines in this fashion has produced very
encouraging results and can be employed for other important tasks where
cohorts, for which health-related information may not be available from other

  Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2017",,,,"stat.ML cs.DS cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of reconstructing a rank-$k$ $n \times n$ matrix $M$
from a sampling of its entries. Under a certain incoherence assumption on $M$
and for the case when both the rank and the condition number of $M$ are
bounded, it was shown in \cite{CandesRecht2009, CandesTao2010, keshavan2010,
Recht2011, Jain2012, Hardt2014} that $M$ can be recovered exactly or
approximately (depending on some trade-off between accuracy and computational
complexity) using $O(n \, \text{poly}(\log n))$ samples in super-linear time
$O(n^{a} \, \text{poly}(\log n))$ for some constant $a \geq 1$.
  In this paper, we propose a new matrix completion algorithm using a novel
sampling scheme based on a union of independent sparse random regular bipartite
graphs. We show that under the same conditions w.h.p. our algorithm recovers an
$\epsilon$-approximation of $M$ in terms of the Frobenius norm using $O(n
\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ samples and in linear time $O(n \log^2(1/\epsilon))$. This
provides the best known bounds both on the sample complexity and computational
complexity for reconstructing (approximately) an unknown low-rank matrix.
  The novelty of our algorithm is two new steps of thresholding singular values
and rescaling singular vectors in the application of the ""vanilla"" alternating
minimization algorithm. The structure of sparse random regular graphs is used
heavily for controlling the impact of these regularization steps.

an upper bound on $Re$ for nearly central collisions at a given temperature;
this upper bound is in very good agreement with the observational lower bound

Einstein gravity, $\eta/s$ does not respond to variations of other physical

magnetic fields arising in peripheral heavy-ion collisions vary strongly with

conversational speech from out-of-domain speakers are then converted into
likelihood vectors, i.e. similarity scores comparing to the in-domain speakers.
These transformed features demonstrate very distinctive patterns, which
facilitates differentiating speakers and enable speaker change detection with
some straight-forward distance metrics. The speaker classifier and the speaker
change detector are trained/tested using speech of the first 200 (in-domain)

the speaker classification, 100% accuracy at a 200 speaker size is achieved on

speaker change detection using speaker classification outputs, performance
based on 0.5, 1, and 2 seconds of inspection intervals were evaluated in terms
of error rate and F1 score, using synthesized data by concatenating speech from

100% classification rate in classification and less than 6% Equal Error Rate
(ERR), using merely about 1 second and 5 seconds of data respectively. Features
with stricter Voice Active Detection (VAD) than the regular one for speech
recognition ensure extracting stronger voiced portion for speaker recognition,
speaker-level mean and variance normalization helps to eliminate the
discrepancy between samples from the same speaker. Both are proven to improve
the system performance. In building the neural network speaker classifier, the
network structure parameters are optimized with grid search and dynamically
reduced regularization parameters are used to avoid training terminated in
local minimum. It enables the training goes further with lower cost. In speaker
verification, performance is improved with prediction score normalization,
which rewards the speaker identity indices with distinct peaks and penalizes
the weak ones with high scores but more competitors, and speaker-specific
thresholding, which significantly reduces ERR in the ROC curve. TIMIT corpus
with 8K sampling rate is used here. First 200 male speakers are used to train
and test the classification performance. The testing files of them are used as
in-domain registered speakers, while data from the remaining 126 male speakers
are used as out-of-domain speakers, i.e. imposters in speaker verification.

clumpy spatial distribution, with an excess in the North-East quadrant of the

Therefore, we penalize in addition to the total variation of the label

factor. A critical point of our biconvex functional is computed by a modified
proximal alternating linearized minimization method (PALM). We show that the
assumptions for the convergence of the algorithm are fulfilled by our model.

problem of designing brake control is formulated as searching for the optimal
policy in Markov decision process (MDP) model where the state is given by the
relative position of the obstacle and the vehicle's speed, and the action space
is defined as whether brake is stepped or not. The policy used for brake
control is learned through computer simulations using the deep reinforcement
learning method called deep Q-network (DQN). In order to derive desirable
braking policy, we propose the reward function which balances the damage
imposed to the obstacle in case of accident and the reward achieved when the
vehicle runs out of risk as soon as possible. DQN is trained for the scenario
where a vehicle is encountered with a pedestrian crossing the urban road.

relative amplitude $\Delta R/R$ of up to $700$\% resulting from the propagation

photoconductance is attributed to the considerably large local electron density

and the so called {\it $\Delta$ puzzle} is studied in a modified quark meson
coupling model where the confining interaction for quarks inside a baryon is
represented by a phenomenological average potential in an equally mixed
scalar-vector harmonic form. The hadron-hadron interaction in nuclear matter is
then realized by introducing additional quark couplings to $\sigma$, $\omega$,
and $\rho$ mesons through mean-field approximations. The couplings of the
$\Delta$ to the meson fields are fixed from available constraints while the
hyperon couplings are fixed from the optical potential values. It is observed
that within the constraints of the mass of the precisely measured massive
pulsars, PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J1614-2230, neutron stars with a composition of
both $\Delta$ isobars and hyperons is possible. It is also observed that with
an increase in the vector coupling strength of the $\Delta$ isobars there is a
decrease in the radius of the neutron stars.

gating in multicore and many-core systems, the network-on-chip needs to possess
resilient communication and load-balancing properties. In this work, we
introduce the Fashion router, a self-monitoring and self-reconfiguring design
that allows for the on-chip network to dynamically adapt to component failures.
First, we introduce a distributed intelligence unit, called Self-Awareness
Module (SAM), which allows the router to detect permanent component failures
and build a network connectivity map. Using local information, SAM adapts to
faults, guarantees connectivity and deadlock-free routing inside the maximal
connected subgraph and keeps routing tables up-to-date. Next, to reconfigure
network links or virtual channels around faulty/power-gated components, we add
bidirectional link and unified virtual channel structure features to the
Fashion router. This version of the router, named Ex-Fashion, further mitigates
the negative system performance impacts, leads to larger maximal connected
subgraph and sustains a relatively high degree of fault-tolerance. To support
the router, we develop a fault diagnosis and recovery algorithm executed by the
Built-In Self-Test, self-monitoring, and self-reconfiguration units at runtime
to provide fault-tolerant system functionalities. The Fashion router places no
restriction on topology, position or number of faults. It drops 54.3-55.4%
fewer nodes for same number of faults (between 30 and 60 faults) in an 8x8
2D-mesh over other state-of-the-art solutions. It is scalable and efficient.

investigated. The walker consists of two coupled ""feet"" that allow the
interchange of the order of the particles while the walker moves. In the
underdamped case, the deterministic dynamics of the walker in a tilted
asymmetric ratchet with an external periodic force is considered. It is found
that the delayed feedback ratchets with a switching-on-and-off dependence of
the states of the system can lead to the absolute negative mobility (ANM). In
such a novel phenomenon the particles move against the bias. Moreover, the
walker can acquire a series of resonant steps for different values of the
current. Remarkably, it is interesting to find that the resonant current of the
walker are induced by the phase locked motion that corresponds to the
synchronization of the motion with the change in the frequency of the external
driving. These resonant steps can be well predicted in terms of time-space
symmetry analysis, which is in good agreement with dynamics simulations. The
transport performances can be optimized and furthermore controlled by suitably
adjusting the parameters of the delayed-feedback ratchets.

order and lead to exotic correlated ground states. SrDy$_2$O$_4$ consists of
magnetic Dy$^{3+}$ ions forming magnetically frustrated zig-zag chains along
the c-axis and shows no long range order to temperatures as low as $T=60$ mK.
We carried out neutron scattering and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements
using powder and single crystals of SrDy$_2$O$_4$. Diffuse neutron scattering
indicates strong one-dimensional (1D) magnetic correlations along the chain
direction that can be qualitatively accounted for by the axial next-nearest
neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
exchange $J_1=0.3$ meV and $J_2=0.2$ meV, respectively. Three-dimensional (3D)
correlations become important below $T^*\approx0.7$ K. At $T=60$ mK, the short
range correlations are characterized by a putative propagation vector
$\textbf{k}_{1/2}=(0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$. We argue that the absence of

candidates challenge stellar evolution models. Indeed, at such a metallicity,
even an initially very massive star generally loses so much mass by stellar
winds that it will avoid the electron-positron pair-creation instability. We
use recent results showing that a magnetic field at the surface of a massive
star can significantly reduce its effective mass-loss rate to compute magnetic
models of very massive stars (VMSs) at solar metallicity and explore the
possibility that such stars end as PISNe. We implement the quenching of the
mass loss produced by a surface dipolar magnetic field into the Geneva stellar
evolution code and compute new stellar models with an initial mass of
$200\,M_\odot$ at solar metallicity, with and without rotation. It considerably
reduces the total amount of mass lost by the star during its life. For the
non-rotating model, the total (CO-core) mass of the models is $72.8\,M_\odot$
($70.1\,M_\odot$) at the onset of the electron-positron pair-creation
instability. For the rotating model, we obtain $65.6\,M_\odot$
($62.4\,M\odot$). In both cases, a significant fraction of the internal mass
lies in the region where pair instability occurs in the $\log(T)-\log(\rho)$
plane. The interaction of the reduced mass loss with the magnetic field
efficiently brakes the surface of the rotating model, producing a strong shear
and hence a very efficient mixing that makes the star evolve nearly
homogeneously. The core characteristics of our models indicate that solar
metallicity models of magnetic VMSs may evolve to PISNe (and pulsation PISNe).

of a solar cell under applied bias to the external photovoltaic quantum
efficiency of the device as measured at short circuit conditions. Its
derivation is based on detailed balance relations between local absorption and
emission rates in optically isotropic media with non-degenerate
quasi-equilibrium carrier distributions. In many cases, the dependence of
density and spatial variation of electronic and optical device states on the
point of operation is modest and the reciprocity relation holds. In
nanostructure-based photovoltaic devices exploiting confined modes, however,
the underlying assumptions are no longer justifiable. In the case of ultrathin
absorber solar cells, the modification of the electronic structure with applied
bias is significant due to the large variation of the built-in field.
Straightforward use of the external quantum efficiency as measured at short
circuit conditions in the photovoltaic reciprocity theory thus fails to
reproduce the electroluminescence spectrum at large forward bias voltage. This
failure is demonstrated here by numerical simulation of both spectral
quantities at normal incidence and emission for an ultrathin GaAs p-i-n solar
cell using an advanced quantum kinetic formalism based on non-equilibrium
Green's functions of coupled photons and charge carriers. While coinciding with
the semiclassical relations under the conditions of their validity, the theory
provides a consistent microscopic relationship between absorption, emission and
charge carrier transport in photovoltaic devices at arbitrary operating
conditions and for any shape of optical and electronic density of states.

simulations in the normal branch of DGP gravity (nDGP) and General Relativity
(GR). Using COLA for these comparisons is validated using a suite of full
N-body simulations for the same theories. The two theoretical templates
correspond to the standard general relativistic perturbation equations and
those same equations modelled within nDGP. Gravitational clustering non-linear
effects are accounted for by modelling the power spectrum up to one loop order
and redshift space clustering anisotropy is modelled using the Taruya,
Nishimichi and Saito (TNS) RSD model. Using this approach, we attempt to
recover the simulation's fiducial logarithmic growth parameter $f$. By
assigning the simulation data with errors representing an idealised survey with
a volume of $10\mbox{Gpc}^3/h^3$, we find the GR template is unable to recover
fiducial $f$ to within 1$\sigma$ at $z=1$ when we match the data up to $k_{\rm
max}=0.195h$/Mpc. On the other hand, the DGP template recovers the fiducial
value within $1\sigma$. Further, we conduct the same analysis for sets of mock
data generated for generalised models of modified gravity using SPT, where
again we analyse the GR template's ability to recover the fiducial value. We
find that for models with enhanced gravitational non-linearity, the theoretical
bias of the GR template becomes significant for stage IV surveys. Thus, we show
that for the future large data volume galaxy surveys, the self-consistent
modelling of non-GR gravity scenarios will be crucial in constraining theory

also remain constant for large, smoother EVPA swings; (iii) the total angle of

treating the other users as noise. Moreover, the sum-rate tends to zero as

to reduce the decoding complexity we consider multilevel coding schemes based
on non-binary LDPC codes (NB-LDPC-MLC schemes) over smaller fields. The use of
such schemes gives us a reasonable gain in complexity. At the same time the
performance of NB-LDPC-MLC schemes is practically the same as the performance
of LDPC codes over the field matching the modulation order. In particular by

orbits and 22 systems with eccentric orbits. We derive orbital solutions using
the 2010 version of the Wilson-Devinney code. The sample is selection-bias
corrected, and the orbital parameter distributions are compared to model
predictions for the LMC and to observations in the solar vicinity. The masses
of the red giant primaries are found to range from about 0.6 to 9 Msun with a
peak at around 1.5 Msun, in agreement with studies of the star formation
history of the LMC, which find a burst of star formation beginning around 4 Gyr

the flat q distribution derived for the solar vicinity by Raghavan et al. than
it is with the solar vicinity q distribution derived by Duquennoy & Mayor.
There is no evidence for an excess number of systems with equal mass
components. We find that about 20% of the ellipsoidal binaries have eccentric
orbits, twice the fraction estimated by Soszynski et al. Our eccentricity
evolution test shows that the existence of eccentric ellipsoidal red giant

if tidal circularization rates are ~1/100 the rates given by the usual theory
of tidal dissipation in convective stars.

a white dwarf and a neutron star (WD-NS binaries), and measure the specific
angular momentum of material lost from the binary in disc winds. By
incorporating our results within a long-term evolution model we measure the
long-term stability of mass transfer in these binaries. We find that only
binaries containing helium white dwarfs with masses less than a critical mass
of $M_{\rm WD,crit}=0.2\,M_\odot$ undergo stable mass transfer and evolve into
ultra-compact $X$-ray binaries. Systems with higher-mass white dwarfs
experience unstable mass transfer, which leads to tidal disruption of the white
dwarf. Our low critical mass compared to the standard jet-only model of mass
loss arises from the efficient removal of angular momentum in the mechanical
disc winds which develop at highly super-Eddington mass-transfer rates. We find
that the eccentricities expected for WD-NS binaries when they come into contact
do not affect the loss of angular momentum, and can only affect the long-term
evolution if they change on shorter timescales than the mass-transfer rate. Our
results are broadly consistent with the observed numbers of both ultra-compact
$X$-ray binaries and radio pulsars with white dwarf companions. The observed
calcium-rich gap transients are consistent with the merger rate of unstable

We will demonstrate this using the canonical quantization procedure. This is

metric-affine formalisms, where metric and affine connections are the
independent variables, are not sufficient to construct a source-free theory of
gravity with affine connections more general than the metric compatible
Levi-Civita connections. This is also valid for many minimally coupled
interacting theories where sources only couple with metric by using the
Levi-Civita connections exclusively. We will discuss potential formalism of
affine connections to introduce affine connections more general than metric
compatible connections in gravity. We will also discuss possible extensions of
the actions for this purpose. General affine connections introduce new fields
in gravity besides metric. In this article, we will consider a simple potential
formalism with symmetric Ricci tensor. Corresponding affine connections
introduce two massless scalar fields. One of these fields contributes a
stress-tensor with opposite sign to the sources of Einstein's equation when we
state the equation using the Levi-Civita connections. This means we have a
massless scalar field with negative stress-tensor in the familiar Einstein
equation. These scalar fields can be useful to explain dark energy and
inflation. These fields bring us beyond strict local Minkowski geometries.

since decades, and nowadays simulations are more and more able to complement
experiments. In these alloys, the $\gamma/\gamma'$ phase microstructure
co-evolves with the system of dislocations under load, and understanding the
mutual interactions is essential for understanding the resulting creep
properties. Predictive modeling thus requires multiphysics frameworks capable
of modeling and simulating both the phase and defect microstructures. To do so,
we formulate a coupled model of phase-field evolution and continuum dislocation
dynamics which adequately accounts for both statistically stored and
geometrically necessary dislocations. The simulated $\gamma/\gamma'$ phase
microstructure with four $\gamma'$ variants and co-evolving dislocation
microstructure is found to be in good agreement with experimental observations.
The creep strain curve is obtained as a natural by-product of the
microstructure evolution equations without the need for additional parameter
fitting. We perform simulations of $\gamma/\gamma'$ evolution for different
dislocation densities and establish the driving forces for microstructure
evolution by analyzing in detail the changes in different contributions to the
elastic and chemical energy density. Together with comparisons between
simulated and experimental creep curves this investigation reveals the
mechanisms controlling the process of directional coarsening (rafting) and
demonstrates that the kinetics of rafting significantly depends on
characteristics of the dislocation microstructure. In addition to rafting under
constant load, we investigate the effect of changes in loading conditions and
explore the possibility of improving creep properties by pre-rafting along a
different loading path.

half-mass sizes of quiescent galaxies increase from $z\sim2$ to $z\sim0$ by a

$\Sigma_{1}$ of quiescent galaxies decline slightly (by a factor of

$\Sigma_{1}$ increases with time, at fixed mass. We show that the central
density $\Sigma_{1}$ has a tighter correlation with specific star-formation
rate (sSFR) than $\Sigma_{m}$ and for all masses and redshifts galaxies with
higher central density are more prone to be quenched. Reaching a high central
density ($\Sigma_{1} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot} \mathrm{kpc}^2$) seems to be a
prerequisite for the cessation of star formation, though a causal link between
high $\Sigma_{1}$ and quenching is difficult to prove and their correlation can
have a different origin.

Out-of-equilibrium fluids with active-rotor constituents have been

active fluids break both parity and time-reversal symmetries in their steady
states, giving rise to a dissipationless linear-response coefficient called odd

vorticity leading, for example, to density modulations within a vortex profile.

hydraulic cranks that convert between linear and rotational motion in
microscopic machines powered by active-rotors fluids.

~0.2--0.4 arcmin (~0.4-1.6 pc at their estimated distances). They are located
at distances of ~5-14 kpc from the Sun and are subject to moderate extinction

observed in pure CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is mostly due to a constriction within the
FeAs planes. These phenomena are best understood using an often overlooked
explanation for the equilibrium Fe-As bond geometry, which is set by a
competition between covalent bonding and exchange splitting between strongly
hybridized Fe $3d$ and As $4p$ states. In this framework, the collapsed
tetragonal phase emerges when covalent bonding completely wins out over
exchange splitting. Thus the collapsed tetragonal phase is properly understood
as a strong, covalent phase that is fully nonmagnetic with the As-As bond
forming as a byproduct.

analysis together with string executability analysis. The analysis of a call to
reflection determines a call to the same abstract interpreter over a code which
is synthesised directly from the result of the static string executability

in the UV for our galaxies and to compare the absorbed radiation in the UV
range with the emission in the IR range. We find that the modelled far- and
near-UV apparent magnitudes are in good agreement with the observed GALEX
magnitudes. It is found that galaxies with low and high equivalent widths
EW(Hbeta) of the Hbeta emission line require different reddening laws with
steeper slopes for galaxies with higher EW(H$\beta$). This implies an important
role of the hard ionising radiation in shaping the dust grain size
distribution. The IR emission in the range of 8-1000 mum is determined using
existing data obtained by various infrared space telescopes. We find that the
radiation energy absorbed in the UV range is nearly equal to the energy emitted
in the IR range leaving very little room for hidden star formation in our

circulation in the photosphere varies in anti-phase with the solar cycle. The
current explanation for the source of this variation is that inflows into
active regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.
When these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they
contribute to the slow down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component.
The behavior of this large scale flow deep inside the convection zone remains
largely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive enough to
capture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of
integration needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection
zone, also masks some of the possible dynamics on shorter timescales. In this
work we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation that emerges from a
3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and
quantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection
zone, where the cyclic large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable
strength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional circulation morphology and
amplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the impact of
magnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution. A dynamic feature
induced by these magnetic torques is the development of a prominent upward flow
at mid latitudes in the lower convection zone that occurs near the equatorward
edge of the toroidal bands and that peaks during cycle maximum. Globally, the
dynamo-generated large-scale magnetic field drives variations in the meridional
flow, in stark contrast to the conventional kinematic flux transport view of
the magnetic field being advected passively by the flow.

Widefield Array at frequencies between 76 and 227 MHz. We model the broadband
radio spectral energy distribution for the total flux density of NGC253 between
76 MHz and 11 GHz. The spectrum is best described as a sum of central starburst
and extended emission. The central component, corresponding to the inner 500pc
of the starburst region of the galaxy, is best modelled as an internally
free-free absorbed synchrotron plasma, with a turnover frequency around 230
MHz. The extended emission component of the NGC253 spectrum is best described
as a synchrotron emission flattening at low radio frequencies. We find that 34%
of the extended emission (outside the central starburst region) at 1 GHz
becomes partially absorbed at low radio frequencies. Most of this flattening
occurs in the western region of the SE halo, and may be indicative of
synchrotron self-absorption of shock re-accelerated electrons or an intrinsic
low-energy cut off of the electron distribution. Furthermore, we detect the
large-scale synchrotron radio halo of NGC253 in our radio images. At 154 - 231
MHz the halo displays the well known X-shaped/horn-like structure, and extends
out to ~8kpc in z-direction (from major axis).

employed in extracting the numerical values of these low-energy constants. Our
results of $\rho_{s1}$ are in quantitative agreement with those obtained by the

convincing numerical evidence for the quantitative correctness of our approach.

decay would demonstrate the nature of neutrinos, have profound implications for
our understanding of matter-antimatter mystery, and solve the mass hierarchy
problem of neutrinos. The calculations for the nuclear matrix elements
$M^{0\nu}$ of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay are crucial for the interpretation of this
process. Purpose: We study the effects of relativity and nucleon-nucleon
short-range correlations on the nuclear matrix elements $M^{0\nu}$ by assuming
the mechanism of exchanging light or heavy neutrinos for the $0\nu\beta\beta$
decay. Methods: The nuclear matrix elements $M^{0\nu}$ are calculated within
the framework of covariant density functional theory, where the
beyond-mean-field correlations are included in the nuclear wave functions by
configuration mixing of both angular-momentum and particle-number projected
quadrupole deformed mean-field states. Results: The nuclear matrix elements
$M^{0\nu}$ are obtained for ten $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay candidate nuclei. The
impact of relativity is illustrated by adopting relativistic or nonrelativistic
decay operators. The effects of short-range correlations are evaluated.
Conclusions: The effects of relativity and short-range correlations play an
important role in the mechanism of exchanging heavy neutrinos though the
influences are marginal for light neutrinos. Combining the nuclear matrix
elements $M^{0\nu}$ with the observed lower limits on the
$0\nu\beta\beta$-decay half-lives, the predicted strongest limits on the
effective masses are $|\langle m_\nu\rangle|<0.06~\mathrm{eV}$ for light
neutrinos and $|\langle m_{\nu_h}^{-1}\rangle|^{-1}>3.065\times
10^8~\mathrm{GeV}$ for heavy neutrinos.

operate under unknown dynamic models. We create such policies by leveraging a
large number of training examples that are generated using a physical
simulator. Our system is made of two components: a Universal Policy (UP) and a
function for Online System Identification (OSI). We describe our control policy
as universal because it is trained over a wide array of dynamic models. These
variations in the dynamic model may include differences in mass and inertia of
the robots' components, variable friction coefficients, or unknown mass of an
object to be manipulated. By training the Universal Policy with this variation,
the control policy is prepared for a wider array of possible conditions when
executed in an unknown environment. The second part of our system uses the
recent state and action history of the system to predict the dynamics model
parameters mu. The value of mu from the Online System Identification is then
provided as input to the control policy (along with the system state).
Together, UP-OSI is a robust control policy that can be used across a wide
range of dynamic models, and that is also responsive to sudden changes in the
environment. We have evaluated the performance of this system on a variety of
tasks, including the problem of cart-pole swing-up, the double inverted
pendulum, locomotion of a hopper, and block-throwing of a manipulator. UP-OSI
is effective at these tasks across a wide range of dynamic models. Moreover,
when tested with dynamic models outside of the training range, UP-OSI
outperforms the Universal Policy alone, even when UP is given the actual value
of the model dynamics. In addition to the benefits of creating more robust
controllers, UP-OSI also holds out promise of narrowing the Reality Gap between
simulated and real physical systems.

devising a distributed algorithm for multi-broadcasting, assuming a subset of

to knowledge about the total number of nodes in the network $n$, the range from
which each node's label is taken $\lbrace 1,\dots,N \rbrace$, and the label of
the device itself. Specifically, we assume no knowledge of the physical

both charge and spin signals, integrated within the simplest three-terminal
device configuration. In a conventional FET device, a gate electrode is
employed to tune the Fermi level of the system in and out of a static bandgap.
By contrast, in the switching mechanism proposed here, the applied gate voltage
can dynamically open and close an interaction gap, with only a minor shift of
the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strong interplay of the band structure and
edge spin configuration in zigzag ribbons enables such transistors to carry
spin polarized current without employing an external magnetic field or
ferromagnetic contacts. Using an experimentally validated theoretical model, we
show that such transistors can switch at low voltages and high speed, and the
spin polarization of the current can be tuned from 0% to 50% by using the same
back gate electrode. Furthermore, such devices are expected to be robust
against edge irregularities and can operate at room temperature. Controlling
both charge and spin signal within the simplest FET device configuration could
open up new routes in data processing with graphene based devices.

connected dominating set with additional accessibility properties. Once a
backbone is created for a network, it can be utilized for fast communication
amongst the nodes of the network.
  The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model has become the
standard for modeling communication among devices in wireless networks. For
this model, the community has pondered what the most realistic solutions for
communication problems in wireless networks would look like. Such solutions
would have the characteristic that they would make the least number of
assumptions about the availability of information about the participating
nodes. Solving problems when nothing at all is known about the network and
having nodes just start participating would be ideal. However, this is quite
challenging and most likely not feasible. The pragmatic approach is then to
make meaningful assumptions about the available information and present
efficient solutions based on this information.
  We present a solution for creation of backbone in the SINR model, when nodes
do not have access to their physical coordinates or the coordinates of other
nodes in the network. This restriction models the deployment of nodes in
various situations for sensing hurricanes, cyclones, and so on, where only
information about nodes prior to their deployment may be known but not their
actual locations post deployment. We assume that nodes have access to knowledge
of their label, the labels of nodes within their neighborhood, the range from
which labels are taken $[N]$ and the total number of participating nodes $n$.
We also assume that nodes wake up spontaneously. We present an efficient
deterministic protocol to create a backbone with a round complexity of
$O(\Delta \lg^2 N)$.

are important in many other kinds of groups as well: differentiated information
and integration. Here we apply this metric to the activity of three types of

8$ kpc away from the main MaNGA target 1-24145, one component of a dry galaxy
merger, identified in the first-year SDSS-IV MaNGA data. The size of the
$H_{\alpha}$ blob is $\sim$ 3-4 kpc in radius, and the $H_{\alpha}$
distribution is centrally concentrated. However, there is no optical continuum
counterpart in deep broadband images reaching $\sim$26.9 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in
surface brightness. We estimate that the masses of ionized and cold gases are
$3.3 \times 10^{5}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and $< 1.3 \times 10^{9}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$,
respectively. The emission-line ratios indicate that the $H_{\alpha}$ blob is
photoionized by a combination of massive young stars and AGN. Furthermore, the
ionization line ratio decreases from MaNGA 1-24145 to the $H_{\alpha}$ blob,
suggesting that the primary ionizing source may come from MaNGA 1-24145, likely
a low-activity AGN. Possible explanations of this $H_{\alpha}$ blob include AGN
outflow, the gas remnant being tidally or ram-pressure stripped from MaNGA
1-24145, or an extremely low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy. However, the
stripping scenario is less favoured according to galaxy merger simulations and
the morphology of the $H_{\alpha}$ blob. With the current data, we can not
distinguish whether this $H_{\alpha}$ blob is ejected gas due to a past AGN
outburst, or a special category of `ultra-diffuse galaxy' (UDG) interacting
with MaNGA 1-24145 that further induces the gas inflow to fuel the AGN in MaNGA
1-24145.

structural diversity of quasars. Cladistics is able to group sources radiating

radio-loud (RL) quasars. The analysis suggests a black hole mass threshold for
powerful radio emission and also properly distinguishes core-dominated and
lobe-dominated quasars, in accordance with the basic tenet of RL unification
schemes. Considering that black hole mass provides a sort of ""arrow of time"" of
nuclear activity, a phylogenetic interpretation becomes possible if cladistic
trees are rooted on black hole mass: the ontogeny of black holes is represented

on complex geometries by immersed boundary techniques. In this study, the
geometry of the fluid domain is described by an explicit level set method,
where the parameters of a level set function are defined as functions of the
optimization variables. The fluid behavior is modeled by the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. Species transport is modeled by an advection-diffusion
equation. The governing equations are discretized in space by a generalized
extended finite element method. Face-oriented ghost-penalty terms are added for
stability reasons and to improve the conditioning of the system. The boundary
conditions are enforced weakly via Nit\-sc\-he's method. The emergence of
isolated volumes of fluid surrounded by solid during the optimization process
leads to a singular analysis problem. An auxiliary indicator field is modeled
to identify these volumes and to impose a constraint on the average pressure.
Numerical results for 3D, steady-state and transient problems demonstrate that
the CutFEM analyses are sufficiently accurate, and the optimized designs agree

interactions between plasma and light needed to correctly explain nanograting
fabrication on dielectric surfaces has been missing in the theoretical models.
With our numerical approach, we show that a self-consistent dynamic treatment
of the plasma formation and its interaction with light triggers an ultrafast
reconfiguration of the periodic plasma patterns on a field-cycle time scale.
Within this framework, a simple stability analysis of the local interactions
explains how the laser-induced plasma patterns change their orientation with
respect to the incident light polarization, when a certain energy density
threshold is reached. Moreover, the reconfigured sub-wavelength plasma
structures grow into the bulk of the sample and agree with the experimental
findings of self-organized volume nanogratings. Mode coupling of the incident
and transversally scattered light with the periodic plasma structures is
sufficient to initiate the growth and the self-organization of the
characteristic pattern with a periodicity of a half-wavelength in the medium.

early homogeneous and isotropic phase. Structure formation is associated with
the growth of density irregularities and peculiar velocities. Our Local Group
is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with a velocity
631+/-20 km s-1 and participates in a bulk flow that extends out to distances
of at least 20,000 km s-1. Since the discovery of the CMB dipole, the implicit
assumption was that excesses in the abundance of galaxies induce the Local
Group motion. Yet, underdense regions push as much as overdensities attract but
they are deficient of light and consequently difficult to chart. It was
suggested a decade ago that an underdensity in the northern hemisphere roughly
15,000 km s-1 away is a significant actor in the local flow. Here we report on
kinematic evidence for such an underdensity. We map the large scale 3D velocity
field using a Wiener filter reconstruction from the Cosmicflows-2 dataset of
peculiar velocities, and identify the attractors and repellers that dominate
the local dynamics. We show here that the local flow is dominated by a single
attractor -associated with the Shapley Concentration- and a single previously
unidentified repeller. Multipole expansion of the local flow provides further
support for the existence and role played by the attractor and repeller. The
bulk flow (i.e. dipole moment) is closely (anti)aligned with the repeller at a
distance of 16,000+/-4,500 km s-1. The expansion eigenvector of the shear
tensor (quadrupole moment) is closely aligned with the Shapley Attractor out to
7,000 km s-1. The close alignment of the local bulk flow with the repeller
provides further support for its dominant role in shaping the local flow. This
Dipole Repeller is predicted to be associated with a void in the distribution
of galaxies.

activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be
under-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm
infants reaching term ages (PMA $\geq$ 36 weeks) using multi-feature
classification on a single EEG channel. Five EEG burst detectors relying on
different machine learning approaches were compared: Logistic regression (LR),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector
machines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually
labeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of
gestation) with 36 - 41 weeks PMA. The most performing classifiers reached
about 95\% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84\%. Compared to
human-automatic agreements, LR provided the highest scores (Cohen's kappa =
0.71) and the best computational efficiency using only three EEG features.
Applying this classifier in a test database of 21 infants $\geq$ 36 weeks PMA,
we show that long EEG bursts and short inter-bust periods are characteristic of
infants with the highest PMA and weights. In view of these results, LR-based

new infections come from contacts of the vector with humans and different

reservoirs cycles with a small basic reproductive number could contribute to

cycles or only on the vector. In this work, we created a simple epidemiological

variational principle on the entropic functional which produces entropic field
equations. This information-theoretic approach implies that the geometric field
does not exist in an empty of matter Universe, the material entropy is geometry
dependent, matter can exchange information (entropy) with the geometric field
and a quantum condensate can channel energy into the geometric field at a
particular coherent state. The entropic field equations feature a non-intuitive
direct coupling between the material fields and the geometric field, which acts
as an entropy reservoir. Cosmological consequences such as the emergence of the
cosmological constant as well as experimental consequences involving
gravity-quantum condensate interaction are discussed. The energetic aspect of
the theory restores the repertoire of the classical General Relativity up to a
different coupling constant between the fields.

waveguides are commonly used in acoustics, optics, geophysics, water waves and
other applications, in the context of coupled-mode theories (CMTs). The
transverse functions $Z_n$ are determined by solving local Sturm-Liouville
problems (reference waveguides). In most cases, the boundary conditions
assigned to $Z_n$ cannot be compatible with the physical boundary conditions of
$\Phi$, leading to slowly convergent series, and rendering CMTs mild-slope
approximations. In the present paper, the heuristic approach introduced in
(Athanassoulis & Belibassakis 1999, J. Fluid Mech. 389, 275-301) is generalized
and justified. It is proved that an appropriately enhanced series expansion
becomes an exact, rapidly-convergent representation of the field $\Phi$, valid
for any smooth, nonplanar boundaries and any smooth enough $\Phi$. This series
expansion can be differentiated termwise everywhere in the domain, including
the boundaries, implementing an exact semi-separation of variables for
non-separable domains. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by solving a
boundary value problem for the Laplace equation, and computing the
corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, involved in Hamiltonian equations
for nonlinear water waves. The present method provides accurate results with
only a few modes for quite general domains. Extensions to general waveguides
are also discussed.

communication network are highly interdependent. Also, it has been observed
that there exists complex interdependent relationships between individual
entities of the power grid and the communication network that further
obfuscates the analysis, and mitigation of faults in such multi-layered
networks. In recent years, the research community has made significant efforts
towards gaining insight and understanding of the interdependency relations in
such multi-layered networks, and accordingly, a number of models have been
proposed and analyzed towards realizing this goal. In this chapter we study
existing interdependency models proposed in the recent literature and discuss
their approach, and inherent features, towards modeling interdependent
multi-layer networks. We also provide a brief discussion into the drawbacks of
each of these models and propose an alternate model that addresses these
drawbacks by capturing the interdependency relationships using a combination of
conjunctive and disjunctive relations.

  Communications with a Partially Observable State",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider an energy harvesting (EH) transmitter communicating with a
receiver through an EH relay. The harvested energy is used for data
transmission, including the circuit energy consumption. As in practical
scenarios, the system state, comprised by the harvested energy, battery levels,
data buffer levels, and channel gains, is only partially observable by the EH
nodes. Moreover, the EH nodes have only outdated knowledge regarding the
channel gains for their own transmit channels. Our goal is to find distributed
transmission policies aiming at maximizing the throughput. A channel predictor
based on a Kalman filter is implemented in each EH node to estimate the current
channel gain for its own channel. Furthermore, to overcome the partial
observability of the system state, the EH nodes cooperate with each other to
obtain information about their parameters during a signaling phase. We model
the problem as a Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning
algorithm to find the transmission policies. We show the trade-off between the
achievable throughput and the signaling required, and provide convergence
guarantees for the proposed algorithm. Results show that even when the
signaling overhead is taken into account, the proposed algorithm outperforms
other approaches that do not consider cooperation.
