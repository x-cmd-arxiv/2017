  Bounded Perturbations",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a fast method to approximate the real stability radius of a linear
dynamical system with output feedback, where the perturbations are restricted
to be real valued and bounded with respect to the Frobenius norm. Our work
builds on a number of scalable algorithms that have been proposed in recent
years, ranging from methods that approximate the complex or real pseudospectral
abscissa and radius of large sparse matrices (and generalizations of these
methods for pseudospectra to spectral value sets) to algorithms for
approximating the complex stability radius (the reciprocal of the $H_\infty$
norm). Although our algorithm is guaranteed to find only upper bounds to the
real stability radius, it seems quite effective in practice. As far as we know,
this is the first algorithm that addresses the Frobenius-norm version of this
problem. Because the cost mainly consists of computing the eigenvalue with
maximal real part for continuous-time systems (or modulus for discrete-time
systems) of a sequence of matrices, our algorithm remains very efficient for
large-scale systems provided that the system matrices are sparse.

regions are generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
molecules. Astronomical PAHs may have an aliphatic component as revealed by the
detection in many UIE sources of the aliphatic C-H stretching feature at 3.4
$\mu$m. The ratio of the observed intensity of the 3.4 $\mu$m feature to that
of the 3.3 $\mu$m aromatic C-H feature allows one to estimate the aliphatic
fraction of the UIE carriers. This requires the knowledge of the intrinsic
oscillator strengths of the 3.3 $\mu$m aromatic C-H stretch ($A_{3.3}$) and the
3.4 $\mu$m aliphatic C-H stretch ($A_{3.4}$). Lacking experimental data on
$A_{3.3}$ and $A_{3.4}$ for the UIE candidate materials, one often has to rely
on quantum-chemical computations. Although the second-order Moller-Plesset
(MP2) perturbation theory with a large basis set is more accurate than the
B3LYP density functional theory, MP2 is computationally very demanding and
impractical for large molecules. Based on methylated PAHs, we show here that,
by scaling the band strengths computed at an inexpensive level (e.g.,
B3LYP/6-31G*) we are able to obtain band strengths as accurate as that computed
at far more expensive levels (e.g., MP2/6-311+G(3df,3pd)).

poles in the photon emission rate. These poles arise for the separation $d

crystallization of aqueous NA droplets of composition relevant to polar
stratospheric clouds (PSCs). The predictions based on the MKLV expression are
higher by about 5% compared to predictions based on our modified expression.
This results in similar differences between the predictions of both expressions

The latter can be obtained by analyzing of experimental data on crystal
nucleation rates in aqueous NA droplets and exploiting the dominance of the
surface-stimulated mode of crystal nucleation in small droplets and its
negligibility in large ones. Applying that method, our expression for $W_*$
provides an estimate for $\sigma^{sv}$ of NAD in the range from 92 dyn/cm to
100 dyn/cm, while the MKLV expression predicts it in the range from 95 dyn/cm
to 105 dyn/cm. The predictions of both expressions for $W_*$ become identical

long-term and densely sampled intra-night light curves in the optical regime,
we were able to construct for the first time the optical power spectrum of the

reveals that: (i) the optical variability is consistent with a pure red noise,
for which the power spectral density can well be approximated by a single
power-law throughout the entire time domain probed; (ii) the slope of power

cut-offs at the highest frequencies down to the noise floor levels due to
measurement uncertainties. We interpret our findings in terms of a model where

chain and triangle structure of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ with three-$\alpha$ clusters,
respectively, in central $^{12}\mathrm{C}$+$^{197}\mathrm{Au}$ collisions are
compared with the flow from the Woods-Saxon distribution of nucleons in

explored by collective flow at the final stage in heavy-ion collisions.

boundary of interest using local communication and sensing, without relying on
global position information or a map of the environment. Robotic swarms may be
required to perform boundary coverage in a variety of applications, including
environmental monitoring, collective transport, disaster response, and
nanomedicine. We present a novel analytical approach to computing and designing
the statistical properties of the communication and sensing networks that are
formed by random robot configurations on a boundary. We are particularly
interested in the event that a robot configuration forms a connected
communication network or maintains continuous sensor coverage of the boundary.
Using tools from order statistics, random geometric graphs, and computational
geometry, we derive formulas for properties of the random graphs generated by
robots that are independently and identically distributed along a boundary. We
also develop order-of-magnitude estimates of these properties based on Poisson
approximations and threshold functions. For cases where the SCS generates a
uniform distribution of robots along the boundary, we apply our analytical
results to develop a procedure for computing the robot population size,
diameter, sensing range, or communication range that yields a random
communication network or sensor network with desired properties.

fluid bounded below by a rigid boundary and above by a free boundary, in the

is present both at the free surface and in the bulk of fluid, and that
conversion from one species to the other is possible. The surfactants couple to
the fluid dynamics through the coefficient of surface tension, which depends on
the the surface density of surfactants. Gradients in this concentration give
rise to Marangoni stress on the free surface. In turn, the fluids advect the
surfactants and distort their concentration through geometric distortions of
the free surface. We model the surfactants in a way that allows absorption and
desorption of surfactant between the surface and bulk. We prove that small

a serious challenge to wireless video sensor networks of weak computation and

  In this paper, our aim is to prolong the whole network lifetime while
fulfilling the surveillance application needs. We present a novel scheduling

intruders and prevent malicious attacker to predict the behavior of the network
prior to intrusion. Our approach is chaos-based, where every node based on its
last detection, a hash value and some pseudo-random numbers easily computes a
decision function to go to sleep or active mode. We validate the efficiency of
our approach through theoretical analysis and demonstrate the benefits of our

explore the capability of the method using large-scale reionization simulations

of the HII region size distribution with a moderate signal-to-noise ratio from
wide-field imaging ($\rm SNR\lesssim3$), for which the statistical uncertainty
is sample variance dominated. We address the observational requirements on the
angular resolution, the field-of-view, and the thermal noise limit for a
successful measurement. To achieve a full scientific return from 21-cm

nodal-line semimetals by characterizing them as evanescent states when the band
structure is extended to complex momenta. We find in this way a sequence of
exceptional points -that is, branch points with zero energy in the complex
spectrum- allowing us to identify the set of surface states with complex
momentum signaling the decay into the 3D semimetal. From this point of view,
Weyl and nodal-line semimetals can be classified in two types depending on the
way surface states decay. Type A semimetals have surface states with smaller
penetration length and oscillating decay while type B semimetals have longer
simple exponential decays. The difference between both types reflects in the
way the branch cuts in the spectrum accommodate in the complex plane. The
stability of the surface states stems in this approach from the complex
structure that develops around the exceptional points, with a topological
protection which is based on the fact that the branch cuts cannot be closed by
small perturbations. We check this property when nodal-line semimetals are
placed under circularly polarized light, where we observe that the exceptional
points survive the effect of such a perturbation, though appropriate boundary
conditions for zero-energy surface states cannot be satisfied in general due to
the breakdown of time-reversal invariance by the radiation field.

Migdal-Eliashberg theory and derive a numerically tractable set of quantum
Floquet-Boltzmann kinetic equations for the coupled electron-phonon system. We
study the role of parametric phonon generation and electronic heating in
destroying the transient superconducting state. Finally, we predict the
transient formation of electronic Floquet bands in time- and angle-resolved
photo-emission spectroscopy experiments as a consequence of the proposed

to the high degree of misalignment, pose, expression, and illumination

images is approached by utilizing image alignment, exploiting multiple samples
per individual to improve the learning ability of the classifier, or learning
gender based on prior knowledge about pose and demographic distributions of the
dataset. However, image alignment increases the complexity and time of
computation, while the use of multiple samples or having prior knowledge about
data distribution is unrealistic in practical applications. This paper presents
an approach for gender recognition from unconstrained face images. Our
technique exploits the robustness of local feature descriptor to photometric
variations to extract the shape description of the 2D face image using a single
sample image per individual. The results obtained from experiments on Labeled
Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset describe the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The essence of this study is to investigate the most suitable functions

is the assumption that the relevant feature of social interactions is each
individual's keenness to maximise his or her status relative to others. The
social networks produced by the model are homophilous and assortative, as
frequently observed in human communities and most of the network properties
seem quite independent of its size. However, it is seen that for small number
of agents the resulting network consists of disjoint weakly connected
communities while being highly assortative and homophilic. On the other hand
larger networks turn out to be more cohesive with larger communities but less
homophilic. We find that the reason for these changes is that larger network
size allows agents to use new strategies for maximizing their social status
allowing for more diverse links between them.

analysis provides a key information on the nature of the complex interface and
lattice distortions occurring when combining these materials. The study of the
electronic properties of the sandwich nanostructure TiO2/ZnO/TiO2 reveals that
conduction band arises mainly from Ti3d orbitals, while valence band is
maintained by O2p of ZnO, and that the trapped states within the gap region

a collection of ""bad"" events $\mathcal B$ in a probability space are not too

Vondr\'{a}k (2015) based on ""resampling oracles"" extended this to general
sequential algorithms for other probability spaces satisfying the Lopsided

  We describe a new structural property which holds for all known resampling
oracles, which we call ""obliviousness."" Essentially, it means that the
interaction between two bad-events $B, B'$ depends only on the randomness used
to resample $B$, and not the precise state within $B$ itself.
  This property has two major consequences. First, combined with a framework of
Kolmogorov (2016), it is the key to achieving a unified parallel LLLL
algorithm, which is faster than previous, problem-specific algorithms of Harris

(2014) for permutations. This gives the first RNC algorithms for rainbow
perfect matchings and rainbow hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$.
  Second, this property allows us to build LLLL probability spaces out of
relatively simple ""atomic"" events. This provides the first sequential
resampling oracle for rainbow perfect matchings on the complete $s$-uniform
hypergraph $K_n^{(s)}$, and the first commutative resampling oracle for
hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$.

initial conditions, because four of the ten components of the Einstein's field
equations (EFE) are constraints on initial conditions. In the previous work it
was proposed to extend the gravity theory to allow free initial conditions,
with a motivation to solve the cosmological constant problem. This was done by
setting four constraints on metric variations in the action principle, which is
reasonable because the gravity's physical degrees of freedom are at most six.
However, there are two problems about this theory; the three constraints in
addition to the unimodular condition were introduced without clear physical
meanings, and the flat Minkowski spacetime is unstable against perturbations.
Here a new set of gravitational field equations is derived by replacing the
three constraints with new ones requiring that geodesic paths remain geodesic
against metric variations. The instability problem is then naturally solved.
Implications for the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are unchanged; the theory
converges into EFE with nonzero $\Lambda$ by inflation, but $\Lambda$ varies on
scales much larger than the present Hubble horizon. Then galaxies are formed
only in small $\Lambda$ regions, and the cosmological constant problem is
solved by the anthropic argument. Because of the increased degrees of freedom
in metric dynamics, the theory predicts new non-oscillatory modes of metric
anisotropy generated by quantum fluctuation during inflation, and CMB B-mode
polarization would be observed differently from the standard predictions by
general relativity.

TDEs have been discovered in large-area monitoring surveys of many 1000s of

every 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ years per galaxy. However, given the selection effects
inherent in such surveys, considerable uncertainties remain about the
conditions that favour TDEs. Here we report the detection of unusually strong
and broad helium emission lines following a luminous optical flare (Mv < -20.1
mag) in the nucleus of the nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxy F01004-2237.
The particular combination of variability and post-flare emission line spectrum

that this event has been detected in repeat spectroscopic observations of a

branch (AGB) star R Sculptoris.
  The visibility data indicate a broadly circular resolved stellar disk with a
complex substructure. The observed AMBER squared visibility values show drops
at the positions of CO and CN bands, indicating that these lines form in
extended layers above the photosphere. The AMBER visibility values are best fit
by a model without a wind. The PIONIER data are consistent with the same model.
We obtain a Rosseland angular diameter of 8.9+-0.3 mas, corresponding to a
Rosseland radius of 355+-55 Rsun, an effective temperature of 2640+-80 K, and a
luminosity of log L/Lsun=3.74+-0.18. These parameters match evolutionary tracks
of initial mass 1.5+-0.5 Msun and current mass 1.3+-0.7 Msun. The reconstructed
PIONIER images exhibit a complex structure within the stellar disk including a
dominant bright spot located at the western part of the stellar disk. The spot
has an H-band peak intensity of 40% to 60% above the average intensity of the
limb-darkening-corrected stellar disk. The contrast between the minimum and
maximum intensity on the stellar disk is about 1:2.5.
  Our observations are broadly consistent with predictions by dynamic
atmosphere and wind models, although models with wind appear to have a
circumstellar envelope that is too extended compared to our observations. The
detected complex structure within the stellar disk is most likely caused by
giant convection cells, resulting in large-scale shock fronts, and their
effects on clumpy molecule and dust formation seen against the photosphere at
distances of 2-3 stellar radii.

be explained in the context of a singular band point or a $U(1)$ symmetry

antiferromagnet has the winding number $Q=-2$, while the typical one observed
in topological insulator surface states is characterized by $Q=+1$. A magnonic

another kagome lattice antiferromagnet. We also derive the sum rule for $Q$ by

preferred storage medium for key-value caches, even though SSD offers more than
10x lower price per bit and sufficient performance compared to DRAM. This is
because key-value caches need to frequently insert, update and evict small
objects. This causes excessive writes and erasures on flash storage, since
flash only supports writes and erasures of large chunks of data. These
excessive writes and erasures significantly shorten the lifetime of flash,
rendering it impractical to use for key-value caches. We present Flashield, a
hybrid key-value cache that uses DRAM as a ""filter"" to minimize writes to SSD.
Flashield performs light-weight machine learning profiling to predict which
objects are likely to be read frequently before getting updated; these objects,
which are prime candidates to be stored on SSD, are written to SSD in large
chunks sequentially. In order to efficiently utilize the cache's available

design and implementation and, we evaluate it on a real-world cache trace.
Compared to state-of-the-art systems that suffer a write amplification of 2.5x
or more, Flashield maintains a median write amplification of 0.5x without any
loss of hit rate or throughput.

giving proof schemata a recursive structure. Unfortunately, applying reductive
cut- elimination is non-trivial in the presence of proof links. Borrowing the
concept of lazy instantiation from functional programming, we evaluate proof
links locally allowing reductive cut-elimination to proceed past them. Though,
this method cannot be used to obtain cut-free proof schemata, we nonetheless
obtain important results concerning the schematic CERES method, that is a
method of cut-elimination for proof schemata based on resolution. In ""Towards a
clausal analysis of cut-elimination"", it was shown that reductive
cut-elimination transforms a given LK-proof in such a way that a subsumption
relation holds between the pre- and post-transformation characteristic clause
sets, i.e. the clause set representing the cut-structure of an LK-proof. Let
CL(A') be the characteristic clause set of a normal form A' of an LK-proof A
that is reached by performing reductive cut-elimination on A without atomic cut
elimination. Then CL(A') is subsumed by all characteristic clause sets
extractable from any application of reductive cut-elimination to A. Such a
normal form is referred to as an ACNF top and plays an essential role in
methods of cut-elimination by resolution. These results can be extended to
proof schemata through our ""lazy instantiation"" of proof links, and provides an
essential step toward a complete cut-elimination method for proof schemata.

in C for performance and portability across *nix platforms, that assembles FITS
images into mosaics. The code is freely available and has been widely used in
the astronomy and IT communities for research, product generation and for
developing next-generation cyber-infrastructure. Recently, it has begun to
finding applicability in the field of visualization. This has come about
because the toolkit design allows easy integration into scalable systems that
process data for subsequent visualization in a browser or client. And it
includes a visualization tool suitable for automation and for integration into
Python: mViewer creates, with a single command, complex multi-color images
overlaid with coordinate displays, labels, and observation footprints, and
includes an adaptive image histogram equalization method that preserves the
structure of a stretched image over its dynamic range. The Montage toolkit
contains functionality originally developed to support the creation and
management of mosaics but which also offers value to visualization: a
background rectification algorithm that reveals the faint structure in an
image; and tools for creating cutout and down-sampled versions of large images.
Version 5 of Montage offers support for visualizing data written in HEALPix
sky-tessellation scheme, and functionality for processing and organizing images
to comply with the TOAST sky-tessellation scheme required for consumption by
the World Wide Telescope (WWT). Four online tutorials enable readers to
reproduce and extend all the visualizations presented in this paper.

gravitational lensing shear using only the available imaging data, without need
for prior information about galaxy properties or calibration from simulations.
The method involves distorting the image with a small known shear, and
calculating the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The method
was shown to be accurate in moderate sized simulations with galaxy images that
had relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without significant selection
effects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear
response and selection biases. We also observe that, for images with relatively
low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the
metacalibration process results in significant bias, for which we develop a
simple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image
simulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including
tests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread
function ellipticity at the five percent level. In each simulation we applied a
small, few percent shear to the galaxy images. We introduced additional
challenges that arise in real data, such as detection thresholds, stellar
contamination, and missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy
properties to induce significant selection effects. Using our formalism, we
recovered the input shear with an accuracy better than a part in a thousand in
all cases.

slope of the bands while this feature is directly associated to the group
velocity and the effective mass of electrons. In this work, both density
functional theory and tight binding calculations were performed and a new set
of tight binding parameters up to the third nearest neighbors including overlap

agreement with the predictions of the density functional theory in most cases
of ribbon structures, even in the high-energy region. Moreover, this set can
induce electron-hole asymmetry as manifested in density functional theory.
Relevant outcomes are also demonstrated for armchair ribbons of various widths

(KBOs) near opposition using the wide-field Hyper Suprime-Cam instrument on the
8.2 m Subaru Telescope. The survey covered about 90 deg^2 of sky, with each
field imaged in the g and i bands. We detected 356 KBOs, ranging in absolute
magnitude from 6.5 to 10.4. Filtering for high-inclination objects within the
hot KBO population, we show that the g-i color distribution is strongly
bimodal, indicative of two color classes - the red and very red subpopulations.
After categorizing objects into the two subpopulations by color, we present the
first dedicated analysis of the magnitude distributions of the individual color
subpopulations and demonstrate that the two distributions are roughly identical
in shape throughout the entire size range covered by our survey. Comparing the
color distribution of small hot KBOs with that of Centaurs, we find that they
have similar bimodal shapes, thereby providing strong confirmation of previous
explanations for the attested bimodality of Centaurs. We also show that the
magnitude distributions of the two KBO color subpopulations and the two color
subpopulations observed in the Jupiter Trojans are statistically
indistinguishable. Finally, we discuss a hypothesis describing the origin of
the KBO color bimodality based on our survey results.

Monte-Carlo Markov Chain approach on 32 systems from COS-Halos to estimate the
metallicity of the cool (T~10^4K) CGM gas that gives rise to low-ionization
state metal lines, under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium with the
extragalactic UV background. The principle results are: (1) the CGM of field L*
galaxies exhibits a declining HI surface density with impact parameter Rperp
(at >99.5%$ confidence), (2) the transmission of ionizing radiation through CGM
gas alone is 70+/-7%; (3) the metallicity distribution function of the cool CGM
is unimodal with a median of 1/3 Z_Sun and a 95% interval from ~1/50 Z_Sun to
over 3x solar. The incidence of metal poor (<1/100 Z_Sun) gas is low, implying
any such gas discovered along quasar sightlines is typically unrelated to L*
galaxies; (4) we find an unexpected increase in gas metallicity with declining
NHI (at >99.9% confidence) and, therefore, also with increasing Rperp. The high
metallicity at large radii implies early enrichment; (5) A non-parametric
estimate of the cool CGM gas mass is M_CGM_cool = 9.2 +/- 4.3 10^10 Msun, which
together with new mass estimates for the hot CGM may resolve the galactic
missing baryons problem. Future analyses of halo gas should focus on the
underlying astrophysics governing the CGM, rather than processes that simply
expel the medium from the halo.

spectroscopy gaps in samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$), which has been a mystery

semiconductor with a depletion length that diverges at cryogenic temperatures.
In this model, we find a self-consistent solution to Poisson's equation in the
bulk, with boundary conditions based on Fermi energy pinning due to surface
charges. The solution yields band bending in the bulk; this explains the
difference between the two gaps because spectroscopic methods measure the gap
near the surface, while transport measures the average over the bulk. We also
connect the model to transport parameters, including the Hall coefficient and
thermopower, using semiclassical transport theory. The divergence of the
depletion length additionally explains the 10-12 K feature in data for these
parameters, demonstrating a crossover from bulk dominated transport above this
temperature to surface-dominated transport below this temperature. We find good
agreement between our model and a collection of transport data from 4-40 K.
This model can also be generalized to materials with similar band structure.

different treatments of orphan (galaxies not assigned to any dark matter

the galaxy formation models generally agree in their clustering predictions but
they disagree significantly between HOD and SAMs for the orphan satellites.
Although there is a very good agreement between the models on the 2PCF of
central galaxies, the scatter between the models when orphan satellites are
included can be larger than a factor of 2 for scales smaller than 1 Mpc/h. We
also show that galaxy formation models that do not include orphan satellite
galaxies have a significantly lower 2PCF on small scales, consistent with
previous studies. Finally, we show that the 2PCF of orphan satellites is
remarkably different between SAMs and HOD models. Orphan satellites in SAMs
present a higher clustering than in HOD models because they tend to occupy more
massive haloes. We conclude that orphan satellites have an important role on
galaxy clustering and they are the main cause of the differences in the
clustering between HOD models and SAMs.

problem appropriate for the downlink with discrete alphabets as inputs. The
solution to the problem provides a power-efficient precoding algorithm for the
base station, subject to minimum symbol error probability (SEP) requirements at
the mobile stations. In the algorithm, signature sparsity is shown to be
crucial for reducing precoding complexity. Numerical results confirm
system-load-dependent power reduction gain from the proposed precoding over the
zero-forcing precoding and the regularized zero-forcing precoding with
optimized regularization parameter under the same SEP targets. For a fixed
system load, it is also demonstrated that sparse MC-CDMA with a proper choice
of sparsity level attains almost the same power efficiency and link throughput
as that of dense MC-CDMA yet with reduced precoding complexity, thanks to the
sparse signatures.

independently of the slower dynamics of the amplitudes, vindicating the
hypothesis of initially random phases; (ii) relaxation of the Fourier
amplitudes to the predicted stationary distribution (exponential) happens on a
faster timescale than relaxation of the spectrum (Rayleigh-Jeans distribution);
(iii) the pdf equation correctly describes dynamics under different forcings:
the NLSE has an exponential pdf corresponding to a quasi-gaussian solution,
like the vibrating plates, that also show some intermittency at very strong
forcings.

(conflation) is important in business data analytics since it could help merge
two different tables in a database to provide a more comprehensive profile of
an entity. However, the conflation task is challenging because two text strings
that describe the same entity could be quite different from each other for
reasons such as misspelling. It is therefore critical to develop a conflation
model that is able to truly understand the semantic meaning of the strings and
match them at the semantic level. To this end, we develop a character-level
deep conflation model that encodes the input text strings from character level
into finite dimension feature vectors, which are then used to compute the
cosine similarity between the text strings. The model is trained in an
end-to-end manner using back propagation and stochastic gradient descent to
maximize the likelihood of the correct association. Specifically, we propose
two variants of the deep conflation model, based on long-short-term memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN),
respectively. Both models perform well on a real-world business analytics
dataset and significantly outperform the baseline bag-of-character (BoC) model.

soft and wet nature that mimic many biological scaffolding structures. The
study of these structures can contribute to a better understanding of this new
micro/nano technology and the cytoskeleton like structural building blocks.
Inside the cell the actin network is regulated by tens of actin-binding
proteins (ABP's), which makes for a highly complex system with several emergent
behavior. In particular Calponin is an ABP that was identified as an actin
stabiliser, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Recent experiments using an
in vitro model system of cross-linked actin with Calponin and large deformation
bulk rheology, found that networks with basic calponin exhibited a delayed
onset and were able to withstand a higher maximal strain before softening.
  In this work we propose a mathematical model into the framework of nonlinear
continuum mechanics to explain the observation of Jansen, where we introduce
the hypothesis by which the difference between the two networks, with and
without Calponin, is interpreted as a alterations in the pre-strain developed
by the network entanglement and the regulation of the crosslinks adhesion
energy. The mechanics of the F-actin is modelled using the wormlike chain model
for semi-flexible filaments and the gelation process is described as mesoscale
dynamics for the crosslinks. The model has been validated with reported
experimental results from literature, showing a good agreement between theory
and experiments.

$^{232}$Th$_{e}$~$=0.28\pm 0.03$~mBq/kg, $^{232}$Th$_{l}$~$=0.25\pm

Such low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for
titanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches.
Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background
contribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of

practice. To reach these goals, we propose a new EEG representation that
provides a more realistic view of brain functionality by applying
multi-instance (MI) framework to consider the non-stationarity of the EEG
signal. The non-stationary characteristic of EEG is considered by describing
the signal as a bag of relevant and irrelevant concepts. The concepts are
provided by a robust representation of homogenous segments of EEG signal using
spatial covariance matrices. Due to the nonlinear geometry of the space of
covariance matrices, we determine the boundaries of the homogeneous segments
based on adaptive segmentation of the signal in a Riemannian framework. Each
subject is described as a bag of covariance matrices of homogenous segments and
the bag-level discriminative information is used for classification. To
evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we examine it in attention
deficit hyperactivity/bipolar mood disorder detection and depression/normal
diagnosis applications. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the
proposed approach, which is gained due to the robustness of covariance

Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm (DBSCAN; Ester et al.

the problem of extracting meteor showers from all-sky camera data because of
its ability to efficiently extract clusters of different shapes and sizes from
large datasets. We apply this shower detection algorithm on a dataset that
contains 25,885 meteor trajectories and orbits obtained from the NASA All-Sky
Fireball Network and the Southern Ontario Meteor Network (SOMN). Using a
distance metric based on solar longitude, geocentric velocity, and Sun-centered
ecliptic radiant, we find 25 strong cluster detections and 6 weak detections in
the data, all of which are good matches to known showers. We include
measurement errors in our analysis to quantify the reliability of cluster
occurrence and the probability that each meteor belongs to a given cluster. We
validate our method through false positive/negative analysis and with a
comparison to an established shower detection algorithm.

hand, and a certain family of positive operators, called transfer operators,
acting in spaces of measurable functions on, on the other. A framework of
standard Borel spaces is adopted; and this generality is wide enough to cover a
host of applications. While the mathematical structures of positive operators,
endomorphisms, transfer operators, measurable partitions, and Markov processes
arise in a host of settings, both pure and applied, we propose here a unified
study. This is the general setting of dynamics in Borel measure spaces. Hence
the corresponding linear structures are infinite-dimensional. Nonetheless, we
prove a number of analogues of the more familiar finite-dimensional settings,
for example, the Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices, and the
corresponding Markov chains. Tools from the theory of operators in Hilbert
space of special significance to us will be the use of a certain universal
Hilbert space, as well as classes of operators in it, directly related to the
central theme of duality for transfer operators. From ergodic theory, we
address such questions as measurable cross sections, partitions, and Rohlin
analysis of endomorphisms of measure spaces. While there are classical theorems
dealing with analogous questions for automorphisms of measure spaces, a
systematic study of endomorphisms is of more recent vintage;-- in its infancy.
In order to make the exposition accessible to students and to researchers in
neighboring areas, we have included a number of explicit examples and

mathematical and natural sciences. Under suitable conditions on the nature of
the system, of the perturbation, and of the observables of interest, response
theories allow to construct operators describing the smooth change of the
invariant measure of the system of interest as a function of the small
parameter controlling the intensity of the perturbation. In particular,
response theories can be developed both for stochastic and chaotic
deterministic dynamical systems, where in the latter case stricter conditions
imposing some degree of structural stability are required. In this paper we
extend previous findings and derive general response formulae describing how
n-point correlations are affected by perturbations to the vector flow. We also
show how to compute the response of the spectral properties of the system to
perturbations. We then apply our results to the seemingly unrelated problem of
coarse graining in multiscale systems: we find explicit formulae describing the
change in the terms describing parameterisation of the neglected degrees of
freedom resulting from applying perturbations to the full system. All the terms
envisioned by the Mori-Zwanzig theory - the deterministic, stochastic, and
non-Markovian terms - are affected at 1st order in the perturbation. The
obtained results provide a more comprehesive understanding of the response of
statistical mechanical systems to perturbations and contribute to the goal of
constructing accurate and robust parameterisations and are of potential
relevance for fields like molecular dynamics, condensed matter, and geophysical
fluid dynamics. We envision possible applications of our general results to the
study of the response of climate variability to anthropogenic and natural
forcing and to the study of the equivalence of thermostatted statistical
mechanical systems.

network with the universal approximation property over space of Lebesgue
integrable functions. This network, called, additive neural network, is very
suitable for mobile computing. The neural structure is based on a novel vector
product definition, called ef-operator, that permits a multiplier-free
implementation. In ef-operation, the ""product"" of two real numbers is defined
as the sum of their absolute values, with the sign determined by the sign of
the product of the numbers. This ""product"" is used to construct a vector
product in $R^N$. The vector product induces the $l_1$ norm. The proposed
additive neural network successfully solves the XOR problem. The experiments on
MNIST dataset show that the classification performances of the proposed
additive neural networks are very similar to the corresponding multi-layer
perceptron and convolutional neural networks (LeNet).

operational steps could be large and the fidelity will decrease rapidly with
$N$. Here we propose a method to generate a new type of quantum entangled
states, $(|NN00\rangle+|00NN\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ called ""double NOON"" states,
with a setup of two superconducting flux qutrits and five circuit cavities.
This scheme operates essentially by employing a two-photon process, i.e., two
photons are simultaneously and separately emitted into two cavities when each
coupler qutrit is initially in a higher-energy excited state. As a consequence,
the ""double"" NOON state creation needs only $N$+2 operational steps. One
application of double NOON states is to get a phase error of $1/(2N)$ in phase
measurement. In comparison, to achieve the same error, a normal NOON state of
the form $(|2N,0\rangle+|0,2N\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ is needed, which requires at
least $2N$ operational steps to prepare by using the existing schemes. Our
numerical simulation demonstrates that high-fidelity generation of the double
NOON states with $N\leq 10$ even for the imperfect devices is feasible with the
present circuit QED technique.

statistics has focused on settings which involve fully-observed data, settings
with missing values and corruptions are common in practice. We consider the
problems of estimation and of constructing component-wise confidence intervals
in a sparse high-dimensional linear regression model when some covariates of
the design matrix are missing completely at random. We analyze a variant of the
Dantzig selector [9] for estimating the regression model and we use a
de-biasing argument to construct component-wise confidence intervals. Our first
main result is to establish upper bounds on the estimation error as a function
of the model parameters (the sparsity level s, the expected fraction of
observed covariates $\rho_*$, and a measure of the signal strength
$\|\beta^*\|_2$). We find that even in an idealized setting where the
covariates are assumed to be missing completely at random, somewhat
surprisingly and in contrast to the fully-observed setting, there is a
dichotomy in the dependence on model parameters and much faster rates are
obtained if the covariance matrix of the random design is known. To study this
issue further, our second main contribution is to provide lower bounds on the
estimation error showing that this discrepancy in rates is unavoidable in a
minimax sense. We then consider the problem of high-dimensional inference in
the presence of missing data. We construct and analyze confidence intervals
using a de-biased estimator. In the presence of missing data, inference is
complicated by the fact that the de-biasing matrix is correlated with the pilot
estimator and this necessitates the design of a new estimator and a novel
analysis. We also complement our mathematical study with extensive simulations
on synthetic and semi-synthetic data that show the accuracy of our asymptotic
predictions for finite sample sizes.

\mathrm{Sel}_{\hat\phi}(E^{\prime d}/\mathbb{Q})$ within the quadratic twist
family tends to the discrete normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,\frac{1}{2}
\log \log X)$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$.
  We consider the distribution of $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_2}

$\dim_{\mathbb{F}_2} \mathrm{Sel}_\phi(E^d/\mathbb{Q}) - \dim_{\mathbb{F}_2}

Specifically, we show that for every $r$, the limiting probability that
$\dim_{\mathbb{F}_2} \mathrm{Sel}_\phi(E^d/\mathbb{Q}) = r$ is given by an
explicit constant $\alpha_{r,u}$. The constants $\alpha_{r,u}$ are closely
related to the $u$-probabilities introduced in Cohen and Lenstra's work on the
distribution of class groups, and thus provide a connection between the
distribution of Selmer groups of elliptic curves and random abelian groups.
  Our analysis of this problem has two steps. The first step uses algebraic and
combinatorial methods to directly relate the ranks of the Selmer groups in
question to the dimensions of the kernels of random $\mathbb{F}_2$-matrices.
This proves that the density of twists with a given $\phi$-Selmer rank $r$ is
given by $\alpha_{r,u}$ for an unusual notion of density. The second step of
the analysis utilizes techniques from analytic number theory to show that this
result implies the correct asymptotics in terms of the natural notion of
density.

which perfectly matches the structure of hybrid precoding. A novel hybrid
channel estimation is proposed by separately estimating the angle information
and the gain matrix, which could significantly save the training overhead and
substantially improve the channel estimation accuracy compared to the
conventional beamspace approach. Moreover, with the aid of the angle domain

Gaussian components which are found to be very stable in terms of their peak
positions and widths across all of our spectra, and subsequently define a
decomposition with fixed parameters which gives an acceptable fit for all the
spectra. We see a strong environmental dependence on the inter-relationships
between our band fluxes - in the HII regions all four components are
inter-correlated, while in the reflection nebulae (RNe) the inner and outer
pairs of bands correlate in the same manner as previously seen for NGC~2023. We
show that this effect arises because the RNe maps are dominated by strongly
irradiated PDR emission, while the much larger HII region maps are dominated by
emission from regions much more distant from the exciting stars, leading to
subtly different spectral behavior. Further investigation of this dichotomy
reveals that the ratio of two of these components (centered at 7.6 and 7.8
$\mu$m) is linearly related to the UV field intensity (log G$_0$). We find that
this relationship does not hold for sources consisting of circumstellar

  We discover a new family of constraint functions $\mathscr{L}$ which define
polynomial time computable counting problems. These do not appear in counting
CSP, and no newly discovered tractable constraints can be symmetric. It has a
delicate support structure related to error-correcting codes. Local holographic

multiple channels among secondary users (SUs) in a wide band of frequencies and
a localized area. A novel Multichannel Immediate Multiple Access (MIMA)
physical layer is developed such that each SU can monitor all the channels
simultaneously for incoming signals and achieve fast rendezvous within the
multiple channels. The spectrum utilized by an SU pair can be changed
dynamically based upon spectrum sensing at the transmitter and tracking
synchronization and control messages at the receiver. Although information
about the number of active SUs can be used to improve the spectrum sharing
efficiency, the improvement is small relative to the cost of obtaining such
information. Therefore, the architecture adopts Multichannel Carrier Sense
Multiple Access (CSMA) for medium access control regardless of the number of
active SUs. A prototype implementation of the architecture has been developed
using an advanced software defined radio (SDR) platform. System tests
demonstrate that the spectrum sharing efficiency of the prototype is close to
an upper bound if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high. Among
other practical issues, imaged interference caused by hardware IQ imbalance
limits system performance. In the prototype, the MIMA is based on an LTE
waveform. Therefore, the spectrum sharing radio can be potentially applied to
the 3.5 GHz radar band for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).

needed as the input of the calculation and Kirkwood superposition approximation

Mobile Hong Kong's 2nd exChange Market), in this paper we study the mobile data
trading problem under the future data demand uncertainty. We introduce a
brokerage-based market, where sellers and buyers propose their selling and
buying quantities, respectively, to the trading platform that matches the
market supply and demand. To understand the users' realistic trading behaviors,
a prospect theory (PT) model from behavioral economics is proposed, which
includes the widely adopted expected utility theory (EUT) as a special case.
Although the PT modeling leads to a challenging non-convex optimization
problem, the optimal solution can be characterized by exploiting the unimodal
structure of the objective function. Building upon our analysis, we design an
algorithm to help estimate the user's risk preference and provide trading
recommendations dynamically, considering the latest market and usage
information. It is shown in our simulation that the risk preferences have a
significant impact on the user's decision and outcome: a risk-averse dominant
user can guarantee a higher minimum profit in the trading, while a risk-seeking
dominant user can achieve a higher maximum profit. By comparing with the EUT
benchmark, it is shown that a PT user with a low reference point is more
willing to buy mobile data. Moreover, when the probability of high future data
demand is low, a PT user is more willing to buy mobile data due to the
probability distortion comparing with an EUT user.

protostars with an internal luminosity lower than 0.2 Lsun. Although a number
of studies have reported the properties of individual LLOs, the reasons for
their low luminosity remain uncertain. To answer this question, we need to know
the evolutionary status of LLOs. Protostellar outflows are found to widen as
their parent cores evolve, and therefore, the outflow opening angle could be
used as an evolutionary indicator. The infrared scattered light escapes out
through the outflow cavity and highlights the cavity wall, giving us the
opportunity to measure the outflow opening angle. Using the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we detected outflows toward eight LLOs out of
20 at Ks band, and based on archival Spitzer IRAC1 images, we added four
outflow-driving sources from the remaining 12 sources. By fitting these images
with radiative transfer models, we derive the outflow opening angles and
inclination angles. To study the widening of outflow cavities, we compare our
sample with the young stellar objects from Arce & Sargent 2006 and Velusamy et
al. 2014 in the plot of opening angle versus bolometric temperature taken as an
evolutionary indicator.Our LLO targets match well the trend of increasing
opening angle with bolometric temperature reported by Arce & Sargent and are
broadly consistent with that reported by Velusamy et al., suggesting that the
opening angle could be a good evolutionary indicator for LLOs. Accordingly, we
conclude that at least 40% of the outflow-driving LLOs in our sample are young
Class 0 objects.

recommendation based on reviews. There have been various studies worked on
recommendation problem. However, most of the studies beyond one aspect user
generated- content such as user ratings, user feedback and so on to state user
preferences. There is a prob- lem in one aspect mining is lacking for stating
user preferences. As a demonstration, in collaborative filter recommendation,
we try to figure out the preference trend of crowded users, then use that trend
to predict current user preference. Therefore, there is a gap between real user
preferences and the trend of the crowded people. Additionally, user preferences
can be addressed from mining user reviews since user often comment about
various aspects of products. To solve this problem, we mainly focus on mining
product aspects and user aspects inside user reviews to directly state user
preferences. We also take into account Social Network Analysis for cold-start
item problem. With cold-start user problem, collaborative filter algorithm is
employed in our work. The framework is general enough to be applied to
different recommendation domains. Theoretically, our method would achieve a
significant enhancement.

  Images",,,,,"cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultrasound diagnosis is routinely used in obstetrics and gynecology for fetal
biometry, and owing to its time-consuming process, there has been a great
demand for automatic estimation. However, the automated analysis of ultrasound
images is complicated because they are patient-specific, operator-dependent,
and machine-specific. Among various types of fetal biometry, the accurate
estimation of abdominal circumference (AC) is especially difficult to perform
automatically because the abdomen has low contrast against surroundings,
non-uniform contrast, and irregular shape compared to other parameters.We
propose a method for the automatic estimation of the fetal AC from 2D
ultrasound data through a specially designed convolutional neural network
(CNN), which takes account of doctors' decision process, anatomical structure,
and the characteristics of the ultrasound image. The proposed method uses CNN
to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical
vein) and Hough transformation for measuring AC. We test the proposed method
using clinical ultrasound data acquired from 56 pregnant women. Experimental
results show that, with relatively small training samples, the proposed CNN
provides sufficient classification results for AC estimation through the Hough
transformation. The proposed method automatically estimates AC from ultrasound
images. The method is quantitatively evaluated, and shows stable performance in
most cases and even for ultrasound images deteriorated by shadowing artifacts.
As a result of experiments for our acceptance check, the accuracies are 0.809
and 0.771 with the expert 1 and expert 2, respectively, while the accuracy
between the two experts is 0.905. However, for cases of oversized fetus, when
the amniotic fluid is not observed or the abdominal area is distorted, it could
not correctly estimate AC.

short-ranged electron-electron interactions in a Weyl semimetal by using the
perturbative renormalization-group method. We find that the critical point
associated with the quantum phase transition is characterized by a Gaussian
fixed point perturbed by a dangerously irrelevant operator. Although the
low-energy and long-distance physics is governed by a free theory, the
velocities of the fermionic quasiparticles and the magnetic excitations suffer
from nontrivial renormalization effects. In particular, their ratio approaches
one, which indicates an emergent Lorentz symmetry at low energies. We further
investigate the stability of the fixed point in the presence of weak disorder.
We show that while the fixed point is generally stable against weak disorder,
among those disorders that are consistent with the emergent chiral symmetry of
the clean system, a moderately strong random chemical potential and/or random
vector potential may induce a quantum phase transition towards a
disorder-dominated phase. We propose a global phase diagram of the Weyl

resolution, lung coverage and number of b-values. In this work, we propose a
novel method that accelerates the acquisition of MR diffusion data by
undersampling in both spatial and b-value dimensions, thanks to incorporating
knowledge about the signal decay into the reconstruction (SIDER). SIDER is
compared to total variation (TV) reconstruction by assessing their effect on
both the recovery of ventilation images and estimated mean alveolar dimensions
(MAD). Both methods are assessed by retrospectively undersampling diffusion
datasets of normal volunteers and COPD patients (n=8) for acceleration factors
between x2 and x10. TV led to large errors and artefacts for acceleration
factors equal or larger than x5. SIDER improved TV, presenting lower errors and
histograms of MAD closer to those obtained from fully sampled data for
accelerations factors up to x10. SIDER preserved image quality at all
acceleration factors but images were slightly smoothed and some details were
lost at x10. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel compressed
sensing method for lung MRI imaging and achieved high acceleration factors,
which can be used to increase the amount of data acquired during a breath-hold.
This methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of estimated lung
microstructure dimensions and widen the possibilities of studying lung diseases

one with both individual profit and social welfare maximization. Firstly a
Lyapunov optimization based algorithm is developed to solve the stochastic
problem. Secondly the double-auction based mechanism is provided to attract MG

we demonstrate that individual MG can achieve a time average energy cost close

studied, where the electron spins precess in a k-dependent magnetic field while
the electrons scatter at localized impurities. For the resulting spin decay,
which is commonly known as the D'yakonov-Perel' mechansim, analytical
expressions in the strong- and weak-scattering limits are available. It is
found by the numerical solution of quantum kinetic equations in a broad range
of parameters that, in situations that are typically relevant for ultrafast
optical experiments, the dynamics of the total spin polarization significantly
deviates from the pertinent analytical results. This is attributed to the broad
spectral width of the optically excited spin-polarized electron distribution,
which gives rise to a spin dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening.
Furthermore, it is found that the decay of the spin polarization need not be
exponential. The notion of a spin decay time becomes ambiguous and different
definitions of spin decay times can lead to different outcomes. The long-term
dynamics of the decay of the spin polarization is even dominated by an
algebraically decaying component. These findings highlight the importance of

derive hydrodynamic-like equations. For simple models of interactions between

P/2016 J1 (PANSTARRS). The two components (hereafter J1-A and J1-B) separated
either $\sim$1500 days (2012 May to June) or 2300 days (2010 April) prior to
the current epoch, with a separation speed $V_{\mathrm{sep}} = 0.70 \pm 0.02$ m
s$^{-1}$ for the former scenario, or $0.83 \pm 0.06$ m s$^{-1}$ for the latter.
Keck photometry reveals that the two fragments have similar, Sun-like colors
which are comparable to the colors of primitive C- and G-type asteroids. With a
nominal comet-like albedo, $p_{R} = 0.04$, the effective, dust-contaminated
cross sections are estimated to be 2.4 km$^{2}$ for J1-A, and 0.5 km$^{2}$ for
J1-B. We estimate that the nucleus radii lie in the range $140 \lesssim
R_{\mathrm{N}} \lesssim 900$ m for J1-A and $40 \lesssim R_{\mathrm{N}}
\lesssim 400$ m, for J1-B. A syndyne-synchrone simulation shows that both
components have been active for 3 to 6 months, by ejecting dust grains at
speeds $\sim$0.5 m s$^{-1}$ with rates $\sim$1 kg s$^{-1}$ for J1-A and 0.1 kg
s$^{-1}$ for J1-B. In its present orbit, the rotational spin-up and
devolatilization times of 2016 J1 are very small compared to the age of the
solar system, raising the question of why this object still exists. We suggest
that ice that was formerly buried within this asteroid became exposed at the
surface, perhaps via a small impact, and that sublimation torques then rapidly
drove it to break-up. Further disintegration events are anticipated due to the
rotational instability.

the Sun is commonly assumed to be due to interactions only with nucleons, there
are scenarios in which tree-level DM couplings to quarks are absent, and even
if loop-induced interactions with nucleons are allowed, scatterings off
electrons could be the dominant capture mechanism. We consider this possibility
and study in detail all the ingredients necessary to compute the neutrino
production rates from DM annihilations in the Sun (capture, annihilation and
evaporation rates) for velocity-independent and isotropic, velocity-dependent

Interestingly, we find that the evaporation mass in the case of interactions

loop of two pomeron cylinders, that is similar to the pomeron diagram with the

gluons (SJ) has the positive baryon number, as well as the antijunction is of
negative baryon charge, our pomeron construction can be covered by only a
certain number of hexagons that are constructed of 3 string junction and 3
antijunction vertices each. It is reasonable to expect that the dynamics of
rapidity gaps in DD should be determined by the number of hexagons on the
surface of pomeron torus. Therefore, the gap distribution in DD events has some
discrete structure in the region of large gaps. Moreover, the string-junction
conglomerate could be released after DD interaction as a metastable particle.
There is another multiparticle process with the pomeron loop configuration that
gives an event with doubled multiplicity in the central rapidity gap. It
corresponds to the cut along the pomeron loop. The events with the gap in DD as
well as the events with doubled multiplicity, each go on the level of 1.2% of

rough stochastic volatility type dynamics. In such models, the log-volatility
follows a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter smaller than 1/2.
This result has been established using high frequency volatility estimations
from historical price data. We revisit this finding by studying implied
volatility based approximations of the spot volatility. Using at-the-money
options on the S&P500 index with short maturity, we are able to confirm that
volatility is rough. The Hurst parameter found here, of order 0.3, is slightly
larger than that usually obtained from historical data. This is easily
explained from a smoothing effect due to the remaining time to maturity of the
considered options.

a popular alternative to establish such correspondences. They achieve accurate
results, but must be trained offline on the target scene, preventing
relocalisation in new environments. In this paper, we show how to circumvent
this limitation by adapting a pre-trained forest to a new scene on the fly. Our
adapted forests achieve relocalisation performance that is on par with that of
offline forests, and our approach runs in under 150ms, making it desirable for
real-time systems that require online relocalisation.

$(1/2,0)\rightarrow (1/4,1/4)$ connecting these two. The overdamped excitations
exhibit strong dispersions along (1) and (3), whereas a much more modest
dispersion is found along (2). This is in strong contrast to the undoped
compound La$_{2}$CuO$_4$ (LCO) for which the strongest dispersions are found
along (1) and (2). The $t-t^{\prime}-t^{\prime\prime}-U$ Hubbard model used to
explain the excitation spectrum of LCO predicts $-$ for constant $U/t$ $-$ that
the dispersion along (3) scales with $(t^{\prime}/t)^2$. However, the diagonal
hopping $t^{\prime}$ extracted on LSCO using single-band models is low
($t^{\prime}/t\sim-0.16$) and decreasing with doping. We therefore invoked a
two-orbital ($d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$) model which implies that $t^{\prime}$
is enhanced. This effect acts to enhance the zone-boundary dispersion within
the Hubbard model. We thus conclude that hybridization of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{z^2}$ states has a significant impact on the zone-boundary dispersion in

eavesdropper. A sensor transmits local state estimates over a packet dropping
link to a remote estimator, while an eavesdropper can successfully overhear
each sensor transmission with a certain probability. The objective is to
determine when the sensor should transmit, in order to minimize the estimation
error covariance at the remote estimator, while trying to keep the eavesdropper
error covariance above a certain level. This is done by solving an optimization
problem that minimizes a linear combination of the expected estimation error
covariance and the negative of the expected eavesdropper error covariance.
Structural results on the optimal transmission policy are derived, and shown to
exhibit thresholding behaviour in the estimation error covariances. In the
infinite horizon situation, it is shown that with unstable systems one can keep
the expected estimation error covariance bounded while the expected
eavesdropper error covariance becomes unbounded. An alternative measure of
security, constraining the amount of information revealed to the eavesdropper,
is also considered, and similar structural results on the optimal transmission
policy are derived. In the infinite horizon situation with unstable systems, it
is now shown that for any transmission policy which keeps the expected
estimation error covariance bounded, the expected amount of information
revealed to the eavesdropper is always lower bounded away from zero. An
extension of our results to the transmission of measurements is also presented.

as a tendency to satisfy the holographic equipartition. It can be expressed by
a simple law, $\Delta V = \Delta t\left(N_{surf}-\epsilon N_{bulk}\right),$
where $V$ is the Hubble volume in Plank units, $t$ is the cosmic time plank
units and $N_{surf/bulk}$ is the degrees of freedom on the horizon/bulk of the
universe. We show that this holographic equipartition law effectively implies
the maximization of entropy. In the cosmological context, a system that obeys
the holographic equipartition law behaves as an ordinary macroscopic system
that proceeds to an equilibrium state of maximum entropy. We consider the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model of the universe and have shown that it is
consistent with the holographic equipartition law. Analyzing the entropy
evolution we find that it also proceeds to an equilibrium state of maximum
entropy.

(e.g., key-value store, raw-block store) that they require developers to
re-invent the wheels, or too high-level (e.g., relational databases, Git) that
they lack generality to support many classes of applications. In this work, we
propose and implement a general distributed data storage system, called UStore,
which has rich semantics. UStore delivers three key properties, namely
immutability, sharing and security, which unify and add values to many classes
of today's applications, and which also open the door for new applications. By
keeping the core properties within the storage, UStore helps reduce application
development efforts while offering high performance at hand. The storage
embraces current hardware trends as key enablers. It is built around a
data-structure similar to that of Git, a popular source code versioning system,
but it also synthesizes many designs from distributed systems and databases.
Our current implementation of UStore has better performance than general
in-memory key-value storage systems, especially for version scan operations. We
port and evaluate four applications on top of UStore: a Git-like application, a
collaborative data science application, a transaction management application,
and a blockchain application. We demonstrate that UStore enables faster
development and the UStore-backed applications can have better performance than
the existing implementations.

of its connectome, i.e. its division into clusters and communities of
topologically-related brain regions. The dominant view, and one that is
reinforced by current analysis techniques, is that communities are strictly
assortative and segregated from one another, purportedly for the purpose of
carrying out specialized information processing. Such a view, however,
precludes the possibility of non-assortative communities that could engender a
richer functional repertoire by allowing for a more complex set of
inter-community interactions. Here, we use weighted stochastic blockmodels to
uncover the meso-scale architecture of \emph{Drosophila}, mouse, rat, macaque,
and human connectomes. We confirm that while many communities are assortative,
others form core-periphery and disassortative structures, which in the human
better recapitulate observed patterns of functional connectivity and in the
mouse better recapitulate observed patterns of gene co-expression than other
community detection techniques. We define a set of network measures for
quantifying the diversity of community types in which brain regions
participate. Finally, we show that diversity is peaked in control and
subcortical systems in humans, and that individual differences in diversity
within those systems predicts cognitive performance on Stroop and Navon tasks.
In summary, our report paints a more diverse portrait of connectome meso-scale

too restrictive for planning many modern real-life services such as fuel
stations, ATMs, convenience stores, cellphone base-stations, etc. that are
widely accessed by mobile users. The placement of such services should,
therefore, factor in the mobility patterns or trajectories of the users rather
than simply their static locations. In this work, we introduce the TOPS
(Trajectory-Aware Optimal Placement of Services) query that locates the best k
sites on a road network. The aim is to optimize a wide class of objective
functions defined over the user trajectories. We show that the problem is
NP-hard and even the greedy heuristic with an approximation bound of (1-1/e)
fails to scale on urban-scale datasets. To overcome this challenge, we develop
a multi-resolution clustering based indexing framework called NetClus.
Empirical studies on real road network trajectory datasets show that NetClus
offers solutions that are comparable in terms of quality with those of the
greedy heuristic, while having practical response times and low memory
footprints. Additionally, the NetClus framework can absorb dynamic updates in
mobility patterns, handle constraints such as site-costs and capacity, and
existing services, thereby providing an effective solution for modern
urban-scale scenarios.

coordinate-dependent complementary error function. The latter describes
smearing of local responses due to Fano fluctuations of the amount of energy
deposited into electronic system. The finite width, $\sigma$, of the $PCR$ vs
$I_B$ arises from fluctuations in the energy partition between quasiparticles
and phonons during the energy down-conversion cascade. In narrow-nanowire
SNSPDs the local responses are uniform, and the effect of Fano-fluctuations on
$\sigma$ is dominant. In wide-nanowire SNSPDs with strong coordinate dependence
of local responses due to vortex-antivortex unbinding and vortex entry from
edges, Fano-fluctuations smear singularities imprinted by vorticity on the
transition part of $PCR$ curve. We demonstrate good agreement between theory
and experiments for a series of bath temperatures and photon energies in
narrow-wire WSi SNSPDs. The time-resolved hotspot relaxation curves predicted

caused by the combined action of a spatially periodic in-plane potential and
the spatially modulated radiation due to the near field effects of light

degree of the lateral asymmetry controlled by the variation of voltages applied
to the individual gates. The observed magneto-oscillations with enhanced

random $K$-SAT, with $\alpha=M/N $ as control parameter, can be solved quickly
for small enough values of $\alpha$. It shows a phase transition between a
satisfiable phase and an unsatisfiable phase. For branch and bound algorithms,
which operate in the space of feasible Boolean configurations, the empirically
hardest problems are located only close to this phase transition. Here we study
$K$-SAT ($K=3,4$) and the related optimization problem MAX-SAT by a linear
programming approach, which is widely used for practical problems and allows
for polynomial run time. In contrast to branch and bound it operates outside
the space of feasible configurations. On the other hand, finding a solution
within polynomial time is not guaranteed. We investigated several variants like
including artificial objective functions, so called cutting-plane approaches,
and a mapping to the NP-complete vertex-cover problem. We observed several
easy-hard transitions, from where the problems are typically solvable (in
polynomial time) using the given algorithms, respectively, to where they are
not solvable in polynomial time. For the related vertex-cover problem on random

of the graphs, like percolation transitions. For the present random $K$-SAT

Birkhoff's theorem and Birkhoff's theorem for finite algebras, the latter also
known as Reiterman's theorem. We prove, under mild assumptions, a categorical
version of Birkhoff's theorem for (finite) algebras to establish a one-to-one
correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)equational

Particular instances of (pseudo)coequational B-theories have been already

To quantify what kind of solar eruptions can result in such SEP events, we have
conducted detailed investigations on the characteristics of CMEs, solar flares
and m-to-DH wavelength type II radio bursts (herein after m-to-DH type II
bursts) for SEP-associated and non-SEP-associated events, observed during the
period of 1997-2012. Interestingly, 65% of m-to-DH type II bursts associated
with CMEs and flares produced SEP events. The SEP-associated CMEs have higher
sky-plane mean speed, projection corrected speed, and sky-plane peak speed than
those of non-SEP-associated CMEs respectively by 30%, 39%, and 25%, even though
the two sets of CMEs achieved their sky-plane peak speeds at nearly similar
heights within LASCO field of view. We found Pearson's correlation coefficients
between the speeds of CMEs speeds and logarithmic peak intensity of SEP events
are cc = 0.62 and cc = 0.58, respectively. We also found that the
SEP-associated CMEs are on average of three times more decelerated (-21.52
m/s2) than the non-SEP-associated CMEs (-5.63 m/s2). The SEP-associated m type
II bursts have higher frequency drift rate and associated shock speed than
those of the non-SEP-associated events by 70% and 25% respectively. The average
formation heights of m and DH type II radio bursts for SEP-associated events
are lower than for non-SEP-associated events. 93% of SEP-associated events
originate from the western hemisphere and 65% of SEP-associated events are
associated with interacting CMEs. The obtained results indicate that, at least
for the set of CMEs associated with m-to-DH type II bursts, SEP-associated CMEs

sciences, particularly genomics. To maximise power while constraining cost and
to minimise type-1 error rates, researchers typically seek to replicate
findings in a second experiment on independent cohorts before proceeding with
further analyses.
  This paper presents a method in which control (or case) samples from the
discovery cohort are re-used in the replication study. The theoretical
implications of this method are discussed and simulations used to compare
performance against the standard method in a range of circumstances. In several
common study designs, a shared-control method allows a substantial improvement
in power while retaining type-1 error rate control.
  An important area of potential application arises when control samples are
difficult to recruit or ascertain; for example in inter-disease comparisons, or
studies on degenerative diseases. Using similar methods, a procedure is
proposed for `partial replication' using a new independent cohort consisting of
only controls. This methods can be used to provide some validation of findings
when a full replication procedure is not possible.
  The new method has differing sensitivity to confounding in study cohorts
compared to the standard procedure, which must be considered in its
application. Type-1 error rates in these scenarios are analytically and
empirically derived, and an online tool for comparing power and error rates is
provided.
  Although careful consideration must be made of all necessary assumptions,
this method can enable more efficient use of data in genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and other applications.

heterostructure, usually regarded as a flat object, can exhibit an intrinsic
buckled atomic structure resulting from the interaction between two layers with
a small lattice mismatch. We studied a freely suspended membrane of well
aligned graphene on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayer by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM). We developed a detection
method in the STEM that is capable of recording the direction of the scattered
electron beam and that is extremely sensitive to the local stacking of atoms.
Comparison between experimental data and simulated models shows that the
heterostructure effectively bends in the out-of-plane direction, producing an
undulated structure having a periodicity that matches the moir\'e wavelength.
We attribute this rippling to the interlayer interaction and also show how this
affects the intralayer strain in each layer.

the distance to a measure (DTM) introduced by Chazal, Cohen-Steiner and

upper-bounded by the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Under some geometric
assumptions, we derive lower bounds for this pseudo-metric. Given two
N-samples, we also build an asymptotic statistical test based on the
DTM-signature, to reject the hypothesis of equality of the two underlying

$\nu$ then $U=\psi(X,Y)$ and $V=\phi(X,Y)$ are also independent for some $\psi$

distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$. Also related characterization questions have
been widely investigated: Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent and let $U$ and $V$ be
independent. Are the distributions of $X$ and $Y$ $\mu$ and $\nu$,
respectively? Recently two new properties and characterizations of this kind
involving the Kummer distribution appeared in the literature. For independent
$X$ and $Y$ with gamma and Kummer distributions Koudou and Vallois observed
that $U=(1+(X+Y)^{-1})/(1+X^{-1})$ and $V=X+Y$ are also independent, and Hamza
and Vallois observed that $U=Y/(1+X)$ and $V=X(1+Y/(1+X))$ are independent. In
2011 and 2012 Koudou, Vallois characterizations related to the first property
were proved, while the characterizations in the second setting have been
recently given in Piliszek, Weso{\l}owski (2016). In both cases technical
assumptions on smoothness properties of densities of $X$ and $Y$ were needed.
In 2015, the assumption of independence of $U$ and $V$ in the first setting was
weakened to constancy of regressions of $U$ and $U^{-1}$ given $V$ with no
density assumptions. However, the additional assumption $\mathbb{E}
X^{-1}<\infty$ was introduced. In the present paper we provide a complete
answer to the characterization question in both settings without any additional
technical assumptions regarding smoothness or existence of moments. The
approach is, first, via characterizations exploiting some conditions imposed on
regressions of $U$ given $V$, which are weaker than independence, but for which
moment assumptions are necessary. Second, using a technique of change of
measure we show that the moment assumptions can be avoided.

the non-extensive statistical approach. In these reactions we are far from the
thermodynamical limit. In small colliding systems, such as electron-positron or
nuclear collisions, the number of particles is several orders of magnitude
smaller than the Avogadro number; therefore, finite-size and fluctuation
effects strongly influence the final-state one-particle energy distributions.
Due to the simple characterization, the description of the identified hadron
spectra with the Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamical approach is insufficient.
These spectra can be described very well with Tsallis-Pareto distributions
instead, derived from non-extensive thermodynamics. Using the $q$-entropy
formula, we interpret the microscopic physics in terms of the Tsallis $q$ and
$T$ parameters. In this paper we give a view on these parameters, analyzing
identified hadron spectra from recent years in a wide center-of-mass energy
range. We demonstrate that the fitted Tsallis-parameters show dependency on the
center-of-mass energy and particle species (mass). Our findings are described
well by a QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) inspired parton evolution ansatz. Based
on this comprehensive study, apart from the evolution, both mesonic and

extend previous results by the first two authors, deriving Regge-Wheeler type

With the choice of an appropriate gauge in each of the two portions, decay
estimates on these decoupled quantities are used to establish decay of the

observations of the dust continuum at 1.3\,mm, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and
C$^{18}$O $J=2-1$ emission from the system HD 169142 at angular resolution of
$\sim 0"".18 - 0"".28$ ($\sim 20\,$au$ - 33\,$au). The dust continuum emission
reveals a double-ring structure with an inner ring between $0"".17-0"".28$ ($\sim
20 - 35\,$au) and an outer ring between $0"".48-0"".64$ ($\sim 56 - 83\,$au). The
size and position of the inner ring is in good agreement with previous
polarimetric observations in the near-infrared and is consistent with dust
trapping by a massive planet. No dust emission is detected inside the inner
dust cavity ($R \lesssim 20\,$au) or within the dust gap ($\sim 35 - 56\,$au).
In contrast, the channel maps of the $J=2-1$ line of the three CO isotopologues
reveal the presence of gas inside the dust cavity and dust gap. The gaseous
disk is also much larger than the compact dust emission extending to $\sim
1'.5$ ($\sim 180\,$au) in radius. This difference and the sharp drop of the
continuum emission at large radii point to radial drift of large dust grains
($>$ \micron-size). Using the thermo-chemical disk code \textsc{dali}, the
continuum and the CO isotopologues emission are modelled to quantitatively
measure the gas and dust surface densities. The resulting gas surface density
is reduced by a factor of $\sim 30-40$ inward of the dust gap. The gas and dust
distribution hint at the presence of multiple planets shaping the disk
structure via dynamical clearing (dust cavity and gap) and dust trapping
(double ring dust distribution).

notably, these classes form the most general subgraph closed classes of graphs

distance-$r$ dominating set problem is currently known. Our algorithm can be
implemented in the \congestbc model of distributed computing and uses
$\mathcal{O}(r^2 \log n)$ communication rounds.
  Our techniques, which may be of independent interest, are based on a
distributed computation of sparse neighborhood covers of small radius on

distance-$r$ dominating set in $3r+1$ rounds on any class of bounded expansion.
Combining this algorithm, e.g., with the constant factor approximation
algorithm for dominating sets on planar graphs of Lenzen et al.\ gives a
constant factor approximation algorithm for connected dominating sets on planar

generations of source packets that are encoded and transmitted over the erasure
broadcast channel. The transmission of packets associated to a generation is
taken to be deadline-constrained, that is, the transmitter drops a generation
and proceeds to the next one when a predetermined deadline expires. Closed-form
expressions for the average number of required packet transmissions per
generation are obtained in terms of the generation size, the field size, the
erasure probability and the deadline choice. An upper bound on the average
decoding delay, which is tighter than previous bounds found in the literature,
is also derived. Analysis shows that the proposed framework can be used to
fine-tune the system parameters and ascertain that neither insufficient nor
excessive amounts of packets are sent over the broadcast channel.

$0{.}055$, partially answering an open problem by Oh of 2013. In the higher
dimensional setting of collections of disjoint balls, generated e.\,g.\ by
Kleinian groups of Schottky type, we prove that all fractal curvature measures

approximately 17.5 degrees, implying an effective guide field in that

binaries. The binary system generates a time-dependent non-axisymmetric
gravitational potential, inducing strong tidal forces on the circumbinary disk.
This leads to a change in basic physical properties of the circumbinary disk,
which should in turn result in unique structures that are potentially
observable with the current generation of instruments.
  Aims: The goal of this study is to identify these characteristic structures,
to constrain the physical conditions that cause them, and to evaluate the
feasibility to observe them in circumbinary disks.
  Methods: To achieve this, at first two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
are performed. The resulting density distributions are post-processed with a 3D
radiative transfer code to generate re-emission and scattered light maps. Based
on these, we study the influence of various parameters, such as the mass of the
stellar components, the mass of the disk and the binary separation on
observable features in circumbinary disks.
  Results: We find that the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) as well
as the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) are capable of tracing
asymmetries in the inner region of circumbinary disks which are affected most
by the binary-disk interaction. Observations at submillimetre/millimetre
wavelengths will allow the detection of the density waves at the inner rim of
the disk and the inner cavity. With the E-ELT one can partially resolve the
innermost parts of the disk in the infrared wavelength range, including the
disk's rim, accretion arms and potentially the expected circumstellar disks
around each of the binary components.

Here, we propose a new mechanism to inject monopoles in a spin ice through a

in the Ho$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ pyrochlore iridate, that it results in the
stabilization of a monopole crystal, which exhibits magnetic fragmentation. In
this new state of matter, the magnetic moment fragments into an ordered part

novel tunable field-induced and dynamical behaviors.

as representative materials. Previously, the dynamic modulus $M_{p-T}$ (defined
in the pressure-temperature representation by the ratio of isobaric activation
energy and activation volume) as well as the ratio $B_{T}/M_{p-T}$ (where $B_T$
is the thermodynamic modulus defined as the inverse isothermal compressibility)
have been suggested as some kind of material constants. We have established
that they are not valid in the explored wide range of temperatures $T$ over
dozen decades of structural relaxation times $\tau $. The temperature
dependences of $M_{p-T}$ and $B_T/M_{p-T}$ have been elucidated by comparison
with the well-known measure of the relative contribution of temperature and
density fluctuations to molecular dynamics near the glass transition, i.e., the
ratio of the isochoric and isobaric activation energies,
$E^{act}_{V}/E^{act}_{p}$. Then, we have implemented an idea to transform the
definition of the dynamic modulus $M_{p-T}$ from the p-T representation to the
V-T one. This idea relied on the disentanglement of combined temperature and
density fluctuations involved in isobaric parameters has resulted in finding an
invariant for viscous liquids in the density scaling regime, which is the ratio
of the thermodynamic and dynamic moduli, $B_{T}/M_{V-T}$. In this way, we have
constituted a characteristic of thermodynamics and molecular dynamics, which
remains unchanged in the supercooled liquid state for a given material, the
molecular dynamics of which obeys the power density scaling law.

theorem. We use this theorem to verify the ""invariant conservation law"" in
relativistic electrodynamics, and unexpectedly find that it is also
fundamentally wrong. Thus the two ""conservation laws"" in traditional textbooks,

background light (EBL) on the attenuation of the hard $\gamma$-ray spectra of
distant blazars. EBL fluctuations occur on the scales up to 100 Mpc and are
caused by clustering of galaxies. The EBL photons interact with high energy
$\gamma$-rays via the electron-positron pair production mechanism: $\gamma +
\gamma' \rightarrow e^+ + e^-$. The attenuation of $\gamma$-rays depends on
their energy and the density of the intervening EBL photon field. Using a
simple model for the evolution of the mean EBL photon density, we implement an
analytical description of the EBL fluctuations. We find that the amplitudes of
the EBL energy density can vary by $\pm 1\%$ as a function of environment. The
EBL fluctuations lead to mild alterations of the optical depth or equivalently
the transmissivity for $\gamma$-rays from distant blazars. Our model predicts
maximum changes of $\pm 10\%$ in the $\gamma$-ray transmissivity. However, this
translates into marginal differences in the power law slopes of currently
observed $\gamma$-ray spectra. The slopes of deabsorbed $\gamma$-ray spectra
differ by not more than $\pm 1\%$ if EBL fluctuations are included.
