  expansive systems","25 pages",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In [2], Bowen showed that for an expansive system (X, T) with specification
and a potential with the Bowen property, the equilibrium state is unique and
fully supported. We generalize that result by showing that the same conclusion
holds for non-uniform versions of Bowen's hypotheses in which constant
parameters are replaced by any increasing unbounded functions f(n) and g(n)
with sublogarithmic growth (in n). We prove results for two weakenings of
specification; the first is non-uniform specification, based on a definition of
Marcus in ([14]), and the second is a significantly weaker property which we
call non-uniform transitivity. We prove uniqueness of the equilibrium state in
the former case under the assumption that liminf (f(n) + g(n))/ln n = 0, and in
the latter case when lim (f(n) + g(n))/ln n = 0. In the former case, we also
prove that the unique equilibrium state has the K-property. It is known that
when f(n)/ln n or g(n)/ln n is bounded from below, equilibrium states may not
be unique, and so this work shows that logarithmic growth is in fact the
optimal transition point below which uniqueness is guaranteed. Finally, we
present some examples for which our results yield the first known proof of
uniqueness of equilibrium state.

computed free energy and pressure of quarks and gluons for a magnetized hot and

used hard thermal loop perturbation theory (HTLpt) in presence of finite

Analytic expressions for Debye mass are also obtained for both strong and weak
field approximation. It is found to exhibit some interesting features depending
upon the three different scales, i.e, the quark mass, temperature and the
strength of the magnetic field. The various divergences appearing in the quark

weak field approximation, the low temperature behavior of the pressure is found
to strongly depend on the magnetic field than that at high temperature. We also

regions of Titan may reflect present and/or past climatic conditions.
Determining the physio-chemical properties and the morphodynamics of Titan's
dunes is therefore essential to understanding of the climatic and geological
history of the largest moon of Saturn. We quantitatively derived average
surface properties of dune and interdune areas (texture, composition) from
modeling of the microwave backscattered signal and Monte-Carlo inversion of the
despeckled Cassini/SAR data over Titan's three largest sand seas: Belet,
Shangri-La and Fensal. We present the first analysis of the backscatter
functions extracted from despeckled SAR images that cover such a large range in
incidence angles, including data from the beginning of the Cassini mission up
to its Grand Finale. We show that dunes and interdunes have significantly
different physical properties. Dunes are found to be more microwave absorbent
than interdunes. Additionally, potential secondary bedforms, such as ripples
and avalanches, may have been detected, providing potential evidence for
currently active dunes and sediment transport. Our modelling shows that the
interdunes have multi-scale roughnesses with higher dielectric constants than
the dunes which have a low dielectric constant consistent with organic sand.
The radar brightness of the interdunes can be explained by the presence of a
shallow layer of significantly larger organic grains, possibly non-mobilized by
the winds. {Together, our} findings suggest that Titan's sand seas evolve under
the current multi-directional wind regimes with dunes that elongate with their
crests aligned in the residual drift direction.

that some of these stars present an anomalously low chromospheric activity,
significantly below the basal level. For WASP-13, observations have shown that
the apparent lack of activity is possibly caused by absorption from the
intervening ISM. Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption
on activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence
late-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra
combined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We
present the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying
several instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative
velocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for
ISM CaII column densities logN$_{\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a
significant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three
dimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII
column density of logN$_{\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of
about 100 pc along most sight lines. In particular, for a Sun-like star lying
at a distance greater than 100 pc, we expect a depression (bias) in the
logR'$_{\rm HK}$ value larger than 0.05-0.1 dex, about the same size as the
typical measurement and calibration uncertainties on this parameter. This work
shows that the bias introduced by ISM absorption must always be considered when
measuring activity for stars lying beyond 100 pc. We also consider the effect
of multiple ISM absorption components. We discuss the relevance of this result
for exoplanet studies.

angular momentum gas as found in high resolution simulations that include
baryonic feedback; ""cold mode"" anisotropic accretion from cosmic filaments. Our
work reinforces the importance of the j-M plane in understanding the evolution

individual subject, using some labeled subject-specific data. This paper
proposes both online and offline weighted adaptation regularization (wAR)
algorithms to reduce this calibration effort, i.e., to minimize the amount of
labeled subject-specific EEG data required in BCI calibration, and hence to
increase the utility of the BCI system. We demonstrate using a visually-evoked
potential oddball task and three different EEG headsets that both online and

Moreover, through source domain selection, we can reduce their computational
cost by about 50%, making them more suitable for real-time applications.

agree with a scenario in which massive brown dwarfs are formed as stars. At

between the appropriate spectra is obtained for Ta and Mo, while a significant
discrepancy is observed for W, which is the appearance of a blurred maximum
instead of the two expected separated peaks on the point-contact spectra. The
absolute intensities of a number of point-contact spectra $G(eV)$ and
electron-phonon coupling constants $\lambda$ are calculated. For all three
metals the values obtained turned out to be considerably below those expected.
The possible reasons for this disagreement are discussed.

probabilities in conformal rectangles for a conditioned version of CLE$_\kappa$

spaces defined over Grassmanians. Additionally, they produced a similar
filtration for loops on $SU(V)$, with a similar splitting. A few years later,
Michael Crabb made explicit the equivariance of the Stiefel manifold splittings
and conjectured that the splitting of the loop space was equivariant as well.
However, it has long been unknown whether the loop space of the real Stiefel
manifold (or even the special case of $\Omega SO_n$) has a similar splitting.
Here, inspired by the work of Greg Arone that made use of Weiss' orthogonal
calculus to generalize the results of Mitchell and Richter, we obtain an
$\mathbb{Z}/2 \mathbb{Z}$-equivariant splitting theorem using an equivariant
version of Weiss calculus. In particular, we show that $\Omega U(V; W)$ has an
equivariant stable splitting when $dim(W) > 0$. By considering the (geometric)
fixed points of this loop space, we also obtain, as a corollary, a stable

alpha-enhanced mixtures are applied to other metallicities. The new models

  PARSEC is able to predict any chemical pattern in stellar evolution. Li is
one of the most intriguing ones. Li abundance derived in POP II dwarfs is about
three times lower than the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis predicts. This
disagreement is referred as the cosmological lithium problem. We reconsider the
stellar Li evolution from pre-main sequence to the end of main sequence by
introducing the effects of convective overshooting and residual accretion.
$^7$Li could be significantly depleted by convective overshooting in the
pre-main sequence and then partially restored in the stellar atmosphere by a
tail of matter accretion which could be regulated by EUV photo-evaporation. By
considering the conventional nuclear burning and microscopic diffusion along
the main sequence, we reproduce the Spite plateau for $m_0=0.62-0.80M_{\odot}$

successful slow-roll inflation when inflation is driven by a single scalar
field with its value during inflation below the Planck mass ($\phi_I \lesssim
M_{Pl}$). In order for a renormalization group (RG) improved effective $\lambda
\phi^4$ potential to develop an inflection-point, the running quartic coupling
$\lambda(\phi)$ must exhibit a minimum with an almost vanishing value in its RG
evolution, namely $\lambda(\phi_I) \simeq 0$ and $\beta_{\lambda}(\phi_I)
\simeq 0$, where $\beta_{\lambda}$ is the beta-function of the quartic
coupling. In this paper, we consider the inflection-point inflation in the
context of the minimal gauged U(1)$_X$ extended Standard Model (SM), which is a
generalization of the minimal U(1)$_{B-L}$ model, and is constructed as a
linear combination of the SM U(1)$_Y$ and U(1)$_{B-L}$ gauge symmetries. We
identify the U(1)$_X$ Higgs field with the inflaton field. For a successful
inflection-point inflation to be consistent with the current cosmological
observations, the mass ratios among the U(1)$_X$ gauge boson, the right-handed
neutrinos and the U(1)$_X$ Higgs boson are fixed. Focusing on the case that the
extra U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry is mostly aligned along the SM U(1)$_Y$
direction, we investigate a consistency between the inflationary predictions
and the latest LHC Run-2 results on the search for a narrow resonance with the
di-lepton final state. %In addition, the inflection-point inflation provides a
unique prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha \simeq - 2.7

which can be tested in the near future.

Floquet formulation adapted to electron-phonon systems. The analysis of the
phonon propagator suggests that the effective attractive interaction can be
strongly enhanced in a parametric resonant regime because of the Floquet side
bands of phonons. While this may be expected to enhance the superconductivity
(SC), our fully self-consistent calculations, which include the effects of
heating and nonthermal distributions, show that the parametric phonon driving
generically results in a suppression or complete melting of the SC order. In
the strong coupling regime, the NESS always shows a suppression of the SC gap,
the SC order parameter and the superfluid density as a result of the driving,
and this tendency is most prominent at the parametric resonance. Using the
real-time nonequilibrium DMFT formalism, we also study the dynamics towards the
NESS, which shows that the heating effect dominates the transient dynamics, and
SC is weakened by the external modulations, in particular at the parametric
resonance. In the weak coupling regime, we find that the SC fluctuations above
the transition temperature are generally weakened under the driving. The
strongest suppression occurs again around the parametric resonances because of
the efficient energy absorption.

Ibc, and higher compared to SNe Ia, N(H$_2$) is significantly higher for SNe
Ibc than for SNe II and SNe Ia. When compared to alternative extinction
estimations directly from SN photometry and spectroscopy, we find that our SNe
Ibc have also redder color excess but showed standard Na I D absorption

when estimated from the environment, but high amounts of extinction when
measured from SN observations, which suggests that circumstellar material or

(sensitive to a large-scale field geometry) we uncovered a remarkable
difference of the global stellar field topologies. Despite nearly identical
masses and rotation rates, the secondary exhibits an axisymmetric, dipolar-like
global field with an average strength of 1.3 kG while the primary has a much
weaker, more complex and non-axisymmetric 0.3 kG field. On the other hand, an
analysis of the differential Zeeman intensification (sensitive to the total

eutrophication of lakes to the presence of Arctic summer sea ice exhibit a
phenomenon known as tipping. In mathematical models, tipping can be caused by
bifurcations, noise, and the rate at which parameters are changing in time [2].
Because traditional methods in dynamical systems are usually concerned with the
long-term behavior of the system, these methods are not always able to detect
the transient dynamics characteristic of rate-tipping. In this paper, we
consider one- and two-dimensional dynamical systems with nonautonomous
parameters that exhibit rate-tipping, as defined as not tracking the evolution
of stable equilibria (QSEs) in the corresponding autonomous systems. We find
that nonautonomous stability spectra in the form of Steklov averages and their
derivatives appear to be correlated with transient rate-tipping in systems with
unique QSEs or with parameters that change at a constant rate. Furthermore, for
systems in two dimensions and higher, comparison of the angle between leading
Lyapunov vectors of different trajectories admits a possible criterion for
detecting rate-tipping. Our heuristic results add to the body of work dedicated
to studying and understanding the phenomenon of rate-tipping.

observations obtained with the CanariCam (CC) instrument on the 10.4m Gran
Telescopio CANARIAS for a sample of 20 nearby, MIR bright and X-ray luminous
QSOs. We find that for the majority of QSOs the MIR emission is unresolved at
angular scales nearly 0.3 arcsec, corresponding to physical scales $<600$ pc.
We find that the higher-spatial resolution CC spectra have similar shapes to
those obtained with Spitzer/IRS, and hence we can assume that the spectra are
not heavily contaminated by extended emission in the host galaxy. We thus take
advantage of the higher signal to noise Spitzer/IRS spectra, as a fair
representation of the nuclear emission, to decompose it into a combination of
active galactic nuclei (AGN), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and stellar
components. In most cases the AGN is the dominant component, with a median
contribution of 85 per cent of the continuum light at MIR (5-15 $\mu$m) within
the IRS slit. This IR AGN emission is well reproduced by clumpy torus models.
We find evidence for significant differences in the parameters that describe
the dusty tori of QSOs when compared with the same parameters of Seyfert 1 and
2 nuclei. In particular, we find a lower number of clouds ($N_{0}<12$), steeper
radial distribution of clouds ($q=1.5-3.0$), and clouds that are less optically
thick ($\tau_{V}<100$) than in Seyfert 1, which could be attributed to dusty
structures that have been partially evaporated and piled up by the higher
radiation field in QSOs. We find that the combination of the angular width
$\sigma_{torus}$, viewing angle $i$, and number of clouds along the equatorial
line $N_{0}$, produces large escape probabilities ($P_{esc} > 2$ per cent) and
low geometrical covering factors ($f_{2}<0.6$), as expected for AGN with broad
lines in their optical spectra.

the GRB energy distribution from the observed one. We find that the GRB energy
distribution cannot be described by a simple power law but requires a strong
cutoff above $1-3 \times 10^{54}$ erg. We attribute this feature to an
intrinsic limit on the energy per unit of solid angle radiated by gamma-ray

elliptic theta functions. A detailed analysis of the equilibria of the model is

about 0.1 dex higher [Fe/H] than in the local thick disk. The Galactic bulge
has complex age and abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected to
the main Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the
metallicity distribution, the star formation episodes, and the abundance
trends, show similarities with the properties of the Galactic thin and thick
disks. At the same time there are additional components not seen outside the
bulge region, and that most likely can be associated with the Galactic bar. For
instance, the star formation rate appears to have been slightly faster in the
bulge than in the local thick disk, which most likely is an indication of the
denser stellar environment closer to the Galactic centre. Our results
strengthen the observational evidence that support the idea of a secular origin
for the Galactic bulge, formed out of the other main Galactic stellar
populations present in the central regions of our Galaxy.

specifications with the trace properties they enforce on interactions between a
client and a library. Separation logic with abstract predicates enforces a
resource discipline that constrains when and how calls may be made between a
client and a library. Intuitively, this can enforce a protocol on the
interaction trace. This intuition is broadly used in the separation logic
community but has not previously been formalised. We provide just such a
formalisation. Our approach is based on using wrappers which instrument library
code to induce execution traces for the properties under examination. By
considering a separation logic extended with trace resources, we prove that
when a library satisfies its separation logic specification then its wrapped
version satisfies the same specification and, moreover, maintains the trace
properties as an invariant. Consequently, any client and library implementation
that are correct with respect to the separation logic specification will
satisfy the trace properties.

multiscale finite element method. Because of scale disparity in many multiscale
applications, computational models can not resolve all scales. Various subgrid
models are proposed to represent un-resolved scales. Here, we consider a
probabilistic approach for modeling un-resolved scales using the Multiscale
Finite Element Method (cf., [1, 2]). By representing dominant modes using the
Generalized Multiscale Finite Element, we propose a Bayesian framework, which
provides multiple inexpensive (computable) solutions for a deterministic
problem. These approximate probabilistic solutions may not be very close to the
exact solutions and, thus, many realizations are needed. In this way, we obtain
a rigorous probabilistic description of approximate solutions. In the paper, we
consider parabolic and wave equations in heterogeneous media. In each time
interval, the domain is divided into subregions. Using residual information, we
design appropriate prior and posterior distributions. The likelihood consists
of the residual minimization. To sample from the resulting posterior
distribution, we consider several sampling strategies. The sampling involves
identifying important regions and important degrees of freedom beyond permanent
basis functions, which are used in residual computation. Numerical results are
presented. We consider two sampling algorithms. The first algorithm uses
sequential sampling and is inexpensive. In the second algorithm, we perform
full sampling using the Gibbs sampling algorithm, which is more accurate
compared to the sequential sampling. The main novel ingredients of our approach
consist of: defining appropriate permanent basis functions and the
corresponding residual; setting up a proper posterior distribution; and
sampling the posteriors.

extract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be
transported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. However, the observational
evidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited. We present
Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the young star MWC349A in the
H26$\alpha$ and H30$\alpha$ recombination lines. The high signal-to-noise
ratios made possible by the maser emission process allow us to constrain the
relative astrometry of the maser spots to a milli-arcsecond precision. Previous
observations of the H30$\alpha$ line with the SMA and the Plateau de Bure
interferometer (PdBI) showed that masers are distributed in the disk and wind.
Our new high resolution observations of the H26$\alpha$ line reveal differences
in spatial distribution from that of the H30$\alpha$ line. H26$\alpha$ line
masers in the disk are excited in a thin annulus with a radius of about 25 AU,
while the H30$\alpha$ line masers are formed in a slightly larger annulus with
a radius of 30 AU. This is consistent with expectations for maser excitation in
the presence of an electron density variation of approximately $R^{-4}$. In
addition, the H30$\alpha$ and H26$\alpha$ line masers arise from different
parts in the wind. This difference is also expected from the maser theory. The
wind component of both masers exhibits line-of-sight velocities that closely
follow a Keplerian law. This result provides strong evidence that the disk wind
extracts significant angular momentum and thereby facilitating mass accretion
in the young star.

accurately determine the sky positions of the sources. The ejecta of neutron
star mergers are expected to produce such electromagnetic transients, called
macronovae. Characteristics of the ejecta include large velocity gradients and
the presence of heavy $r$-process elements, which pose significant challenges
to the accurate calculation of radiative opacities and radiation transport. For
example, these opacities include a dense forest of bound-bound features arising
from near-neutral lanthanide and actinide elements. Here we investigate the use
of fine-structure, line-smeared opacities that preserve the integral of the
opacity over frequency, which is an alternative approach to the
expansion-opacity formalism. The use of area-preserving line profiles produces
frequency-dependent opacities that are one to two orders of magnitude greater
than those obtained with the use of expansion opacities in the Sobolev
approximation. Opacities are calculated for four $r$-process elements (cerium,
neodymium, samarium and uranium) using fully and semi-relativistic methods, as
well as different amounts of configuration interaction in the atomic structure,
in order to test the sensitivity of the emission to the underlying atomic
physics. We determine the effect of these new opacities on simulated spectra
and broad-band light curves by applying a multi-dimensional ray-trace method to
the ejecta predicted from 3-dimensional merger calculations. With our
substantially larger opacities the simulations yield slightly lower
luminosities that peak in the mid-IR. These results suggest that those
radioactively powered transients that are related to the very heaviest
$r$-process material are more difficult to observe than previously believed.

  HAWC is located in Mexico at a latitude of 19 degree North and was completed
in March 2015. Here, we present the 2HWC catalog, which is the result of the
first source search realized with the complete HAWC detector. Realized with 507
days of data and represents the most sensitive TeV survey to date for such a
large fraction of the sky. A total of 39 sources were detected, with an
expected contamination of 0.5 due to background fluctuation. Out of these
sources, 16 are more than one degree away from any previously reported TeV
source. The source list, including the position measurement, spectrum
measurement, and uncertainties, is reported. Seven of the detected sources may
be associated with pulsar wind nebulae, two with supernova remnants, two with
blazars, and the remaining 23 have no firm identification yet.

stars with the highest UV fluxes do not form haze due to the formation of
photochemical oxygen radicals that destroy haze precursors. Organic hazes
impact planetary habitability via UV shielding and surface cooling, but this
cooling is minimized around M dwarfs whose energy is emitted at wavelengths
where organic hazes are relatively transparent. We generate spectra to test the
detectability of haze. For 10 transits of a planet orbiting GJ 876 observed by
the James Webb Space Telescope, haze makes gaseous absorption features at
wavelengths $<$ 2.5 $\mu$m 2-10$\sigma$ shallower compared to a haze-free
planet, and methane and carbon dioxide are detectable at $>$5$\sigma$. A haze
absorption feature can be detected at 5$\sigma$ near 6.3 $\mu$m, but higher
signal-to-noise is needed to distinguish haze from adjacent absorbers. For
direct imaging of a planet at 10 parsecs using a coronagraphic 10-meter class

computerized algorithms are applied to automatically detect subsurface buried

thus desirable to learn off-policy without using the ratios. However, such an

In this paper, we introduce the first such algorithm based on

bootstrapping in TD updates in an action-dependent manner. Our new algorithm
achieves stability using a two-timescale gradient-based TD update. A prior

to be particularly relevant to gas uptake studies on CNTs. In addition, a
selection of density functional theory (DFT) exchangecorrelation(xc)

cellular processes is often a challenging task. In recent work on models of
gene expression, it was shown that a mapping based on partitioning of Poisson
arrivals (PPA-mapping) can lead to exact solutions for previously unsolved
problems. While the approach can be used in general when the model involves
Poisson processes corresponding to creation or degradation, current
applications of the method and new results derived using it have been limited
to date. In this paper, we present the exact solution of a variation of the
two-stage model of gene expression (with time dependent transition rates)
describing the arbitrary partitioning of proteins. The methodology proposed
makes full use of the the PPA-mapping by transforming the original problem into
a new process describing the evolution of three biological switches. Based on a
succession of transformations, the method leads to a hierarchy of reduced
models. We give an integral expression of the time dependent generating
function as well as explicit results for the mean, variance, and correlation
function. Finally, we discuss how results for time dependent parameters can be
extended to the three-stage model and used to make inferences about models with
parameter fluctuations induced by hidden stochastic variables.

this phenomenon in a particular limit of the LLM geometries. In this limit, the
UV complete minisuperspace of allowed quantum states is exactly given by the
Hilbert space of a free chiral boson in two dimensions. We construct this
chiral boson purely in terms of combinatorial objects associated with the
permutation group. As a byproduct of this analysis, we re-derive the
Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for characters of the permutation group. We are able to
express this rule in terms of operator relations for raising and lowering
operators on the Hilbert space of states in a free fermion basis. Our
construction provides a preferred notion of bulk locality by studying an
appropriate notion of D-brane state generating functions. We describe how
multi-droplet LLM geometries with different topologies give new classical
limits of the free chiral boson, even though they can be written as
superpositions of coherent states with trivial topology. As a consequence,
topology cannot be accessed by a single operator measurement in this quantum
system. We study other non-linear measurements in the quantum wave-function,
based on uncertainty and entanglement between modes of the chiral boson, that
can be used as order parameters to measure the topology of such states.

an ongoing nonlinear cascade, e.g. a well-defined spectrum in frequency,
together with some characteristics more commonly associated with the linear
propagation of waves from the Sun, such as the variation of fluctuation
amplitude with distance, dominated by solar wind expansion effects. Therefore
both nonlinearities and expansion must be included simultaneously in any
successful model of solar wind turbulence evolution. Because of the disparate
spatial scales involved, direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the
solar wind represent an arduous task, especially if one wants to go beyond the
incompressible approximation. Indeed, most simulations neglect solar wind
expansion effects entirely. Here we develop a numerical model to simulate
turbulent fluctuations from the outer corona to 1 AU and beyond, including the
sub-Alfv\'enic corona. The accelerating expanding box (AEB) extends the
validity of previous expanding box models by taking into account both the
acceleration of the solar wind and the inhomogeneity of background density and
magnetic field. Our method incorporates a background accelerating wind within a
magnetic field that naturally follows the Parker spiral evolution using a
two-scale analysis in which the macroscopic spatial effect coupling
fluctuations with background gradients becomes a time-dependent coupling term
in a homogeneous box. In this paper we describe the AEB model in detail and
discuss its main properties, illustrating its validity by studying Alfv\'en
wave propagation across the Alfv\'en critical point.

are only detected in polarization. The circular polarized fractions are limited
to $>27$% at 3$\sigma$ confidence and two of the flares exhibit polarity

that the flux density of these flares does not vary over the 30 MHz bandwidth

estimate brightness temperatures between $(10^{13}-10^{14})\,$K, indicative of
a coherent emission mechanism. The brightness temperature and polarization
characteristics point to the electron cyclotron maser mechanism. We also
calculate the flare rates given our four observed flares and compare them to

coverings of a closed compact manifold $M$. The monodromy of a weak solenoid
defines an equicontinuous minimal action on a Cantor space $X$ by the
fundamental group $G$ of $M$. The discriminant group of this action is an
obstruction to this action being homogeneous. The discriminant vanishes if the
group $G$ is abelian, but there are examples of actions of nilpotent groups for
which the discriminant is non-trivial. The action is said to be stable if the
discriminant group remains unchanged for the induced action on sufficiently
small clopen neighborhoods in $X$. If the discriminant group never stabilizes
as the diameter of the clopen set $U$ tends to zero, then we say that the
action is unstable, and the weak solenoid which defines it is said to be wild.
In this work, we show two main results in the course of our study of the
properties of the discriminant group for Cantor actions. First, the tail
equivalence class of the sequence of discriminant groups obtained for the
restricted action on a neighborhood basis system of a point in $X$ defines an
invariant of the return equivalence class of the action, called the asymptotic
discriminant, which is consequently an invariant of the homeomorphism class of
the weak solenoid. Second, we construct uncountable collections of wild
solenoids with pairwise distinct asymptotic discriminant invariants for a fixed
base manifold $M$, and hence fixed finitely-presented group $G$, which are thus
pairwise non-homeomorphic. The study in this work is the continuation of the
seminal works on homeomorphisms of weak solenoids by Rogers and Tollefson in
1971, and is dedicated to the memory of Jim Rogers.

realize the Klein paradox, which is one of the most exotic and striking
properties of relativistic particles. In the seminal theoretical work
[Katsnelson et al., Nat. Phys. 2 620 (2006)], it was predicted that the
massless Dirac fermions can pass through one-dimensional (1D) potential
barriers unimpededly at normal incidence. Such a result seems to preclude
confinement of the massless Dirac fermions in graphene by using 1D potential
barriers. Here, we demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that
massless Dirac fermions can be trapped in quasi-1D npn junction of a continuous
graphene monolayer. Because of highly anisotropic transmission of the massless
Dirac fermions at n-p junction boundaries (the so-called Klein tunneling in
graphene), charge carries incident at large oblique angles will be reflected
from one edge of the junction with high probability and continue to bounce from
the opposite edge. Consequently, these electrons are trapped for a finite time
to form quasi-bound states in the quasi-1D npn junction. The quasi-bound states
seen as pronounced resonances are probed and the quantum interference patterns
arising from these states are directly visualized in our scanning tunneling
microscope measurements.

n = 1-5 water molecules, all the reactants follow a stepwise pathway to the
transition state. For n = 6-8 water molecules, all the reactants undergo a
direct proton transfer to the transition state with overall lower activation
free energy. The activation free energy of the reaction is dramatically reduced
from 10.4 to 2.4 kcal/mol as the number of water molecules increases from 1 to
6. Meanwhile, the degree of the hydrolysis of CO32- is significantly increased
compared to the bulk water solution scenario. The incomplete hydration shells
facilitate the hydrolysis of CO32- with few water molecules (especially for n =

challenge remains to develop methods capable of handling large pose variations

method for learning a feature representation that is invariant to pose, without
requiring extensive pose coverage in training data. We first propose to
generate non-frontal views from a single frontal face, in order to increase the
diversity of training data while preserving accurate facial details that are
critical for identity discrimination. Our next contribution is to seek a rich
embedding that encodes identity features, as well as non-identity ones such as
pose and landmark locations. Finally, we propose a new feature reconstruction
metric learning to explicitly disentangle identity and pose, by demanding
alignment between the feature reconstructions through various combinations of
identity and pose features, which is obtained from two images of the same
subject. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild face datasets, such as
MultiPIE, 300WLP and the profile view database CFP, show that our method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially on images with large

targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision convolutional
neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose weights are
constrained to be either powers of two or zero. Unlike existing methods which
are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve
this issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three
interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and
re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each
layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the
first group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are
quantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group
are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus
they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations
are repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all
the weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental
network quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments
on the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN
architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the
efficacy of the proposed method. Specifically, at 5-bit quantization, our
models have improved accuracy than the 32-bit floating-point references. Taking
ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit,
3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights have improved or very similar accuracy against

  a new ordered MAX phase","Submitted to Journal of Alloys and Compounds",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present study we employed density functional theory calculations to
investigate the mechanical behavior, bonding nature and defect processes of the
new ordered MAX phase Mo2ScAlC2. The mechanical stability of the compound is
verified with its single crystal elastic constants. The new phase Mo2ScAlC2 is
anticipated to be prone to shear along the crystallographic b and c axes, when
a rational force is applied to the crystallographic a axis. The compressibility
along the <001> direction under uniaxial stress is expected to be easier in
Mo2ScAlC2. Additionally, the volume deformation should be easier in Mo2ScAlC2
than in the isostructural Mo2TiAlC2. Mo2ScAlC2 is predicted to behave in a
brittle manner. Due to its higher Debye temperature, Mo2ScAlC2 is expected to
be thermally more conductive than Mo2TiAlC2. The cross-slip pinning procedure
should be significantly easier in Mo2ScAlC2 as compared to Mo2TiAlC2. The new
ordered MAX phase Mo2ScAlC2 has a mixed character of strong covalent and
metallic bonding with limited ionic nature. Both Mo-C and Mo-Al bonds are
expected to be more covalent in Mo2ScAlC2 than those of Mo2TiAlC2. the level of
covalency of Sc-C bond is somewhat low compared to a similar bond Ti-C in
Mo2TiAlC2. Due to its reduced hardness, Mo2ScAlC2 should be softer and more
easily machinable compared to Mo2TiAlC2. Fermi surface topology of the new
compound is formed mainly due to the low-dispersive Mo 4d-like bands. The
intrinsic defect processes reveal that the level of radiation tolerance in
Mo2ScAlC2 is not as high as in other MAX phases such as Ti3AlC2.

linear inverse problems from noisy measurements, with exciting applications

growing prevalence of big data systems has increased interest in large-scale
problems, which may involve huge measurement matrices that are unsuitable for
conventional computing systems. To address the challenge of large-scale
processing, multiprocessor (MP) versions of AMP have been developed. We provide
an overview of two such MP-AMP variants. In row-MP-AMP, each computing node
stores a subset of the rows of the matrix and processes corresponding
measurements. In column- MP-AMP, each node stores a subset of columns, and is
solely responsible for reconstructing a portion of the signal. We will discuss
pros and cons of both approaches, summarize recent research results for each,
and explain when each one may be a viable approach. Aspects that are
highlighted include some recent results on state evolution for both MP-AMP
algorithms, and the use of data compression to reduce communication in the MP

estimators suffer from boundary biases, which are prevalent in real world data

consistency of this debiased estimator. We provide numerical experiments

promising plasmonic material with good metallic and refractory (high

practical plasmonic devices operating at elevated temperatures for energy

on the temperature dependent dielectric functions of TiN thin films of varying
thicknesses in the technologically relevant visible and near-infrared
wavelength range from 330 nm to 2000 nm for temperatures up to 900 0C using
in-situ high temperature ellipsometry. Our findings show that the complex

parameters at room temperature, indicating degradation in plasmonic properties
both in the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. However, quite
strikingly, the relative changes of the optical properties of TiN are
significantly smaller compared to its noble metal counterparts. Using
simulations, we demonstrate that incorporating the temperature-induced
deviations into the numerical models leads to significant differences in the
optical responses of high temperature nanophotonic systems. These studies hold
the key for accurate modeling of high temperature TiN based optical elements

scalability and reliability of the control plane have become major concerns. To
mitigate such concerns, two kinds of solutions have been proposed separately.
One is multi- controller architecture, i.e., a logically centralized control
plane with physically distributed controllers. The other is control devolution,
i.e., delegating control of some flows back to switches. Most of existing
solutions adopt either static switch-controller association or static
devolution, which may not adapt well to the traffic variation, leading to high
communication costs between switches and controller, and high computation costs
of switches. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to jointly consider both
solutions, i.e., we dynamically associate switches with controllers and
dynamically devolve control of flows to switches. Our scheme is an efficient
online algorithm that does not need the statistics of traffic flows. By
adjusting a parameter, we can make a trade- off between costs and queue

yields much lower costs or latency compared to other schemes, as well as
balanced loads among controllers.

rely on future galaxy surveys to elucidate. In this paper we compare the
topological properties of the large scale dark matter distribution in a number
of cosmological models using hydrodynamical simulations and the cosmological
genus statistic. Genus curves are computed from z = 11 to z = 0 for
{\Lambda}CDM, Quintessence and Warm Dark Matter models, over a scale range of 1
to 20 Mpc/h. The curves are analysed in terms of their Hermite spectra to
describe the power contained in non-Gaussian deformations to the cosmological
density field. We find that the {\Lambda}CDM and {\Lambda}WDM models produce
nearly identical genus curves indicating no topological differences in
structure formation. The Quintessence model, which differs solely in its
expansion history, produces significant differences in the strength and
redshift evolution of non-Gaussian modes associated with higher cluster
abundances and lower void abundances. These effects are robust to cosmic
variance and are characteristically different from those produced by tweaking
the parameters of a {\Lambda}CDM model. Given the simplicity and similarity of
the models, detecting these discrepancies represents a promising avenue for
understanding the effect of non-standard cosmologies on large-scale structure.

called SWaT Security Showdown (S3). Six teams acted as attackers in a security
competition leveraging an ICS testbed, with several academic defense systems
attempting to detect the ongoing attacks. The event was conducted in two
phases. The online phase (a jeopardy-style CTF) served as a training session.
The live phase was structured as an attack-defense CTF. We acted as judges and
we assigned points to the attacker teams according to a scoring system that we
developed internally based on multiple factors, including realistic attacker

  Application to Consortium Blockchains",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a deterministic Byzantine consensus algorithm that
relies on a new weak coordinator. As opposed to previous algorithms that cannot
terminate in the presence of a faulty or slow coordinator, our algorithm can
terminate even when its coordinator is faulty, hence the name weak coordinator.
The key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as
they receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message
from a coordinator that may be slow.
  The resulting algorithm assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal,
time optimal and does not need signatures. Our presentation is didactic: we
first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to
ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue
consensus to binary consensus that may terminate in 4 message delays. To
evaluate our algorithm, we deployed it on 100 machines distributed in 5
datacenters across different continents and compared its performance against
the randomized solution from Mostefaoui, Moumem and Raynal [PODC14] that
terminates in O(1) rounds in expectation. Our algorithm always outperforms the
latter even in the presence of Byzantine behaviors. Our algorithm has a
subsecond average latency in most of our geo-distributed experiments, even when
attacked by a well-engineered coalition of Byzantine processes.

Our models are refinements of the FIDO (Force-Free Inside, Dissipative Outside)
models whose dissipative regions are restricted on the equatorial current-sheet
outside the light-cylinder. Taking into account the observed cutoff-energies of
all the Fermi-pulsars and assuming that a) the corresponding $\gamma-$ray
pulsed emission is due to curvature radiation at the radiation-reaction-limit
regime and b) this emission is produced at the equatorial current-sheet near
the light-cylinder, we show that the \emph{Fermi}-data provide clear
indications about the corresponding accelerating electric-field components. A
direct comparison between the \emph{Fermi} cutoff-energies and the model ones
reveals that $\sigma$ increases with $\dot{\mathcal{E}}$ for high
$\dot{\mathcal{E}}$-values while it saturates for low ones. This comparison
indicates also that the corresponding gap-width increases toward low
$\dot{\mathcal{E}}$-values. Assuming the Goldreich-Julian flux for the emitting
particles we calculate the total $\gamma-$ray luminosity $(L_{\gamma})$. A
comparison between the dependence of the Fermi $L_{\gamma}$-values and the

illustrate the possibility of almost shape invariant states in both the

to propagate with almost no change in width if the proper initial condition is
satisfied. Even for repulsive intra-atomic and attractive inter-atomic
interaction ($g_{\alpha\beta}$) one can tune $|g_{\alpha\beta}|$ such that the
width of the propagating wave packet remains bounded within almost about
$10\%$. We also discuss the dynamics of the initially phase separated

due to collisions. However, when BEC is trapped in simple harmonic
oscillator(SHO) potential, for $g_{\alpha\beta}>0$, it is possible for an
initially overlapping state to retain its initial shape if $g_{\alpha\beta}$ is
less than a critical value ($g_{\alpha\beta}^c$). If $g_{\alpha\beta}$ exceeds
$g_{\alpha\beta}^c$, an overlapping state can become phase separated while

their interacting partner and their walking goal in their vision field, and to
keep a comfortable distance between them. These two behaviours account
respectively for the angular and radial part of the potential from which the
force providing the pedestrian acceleration is derived. The angular term is
asymmetric, i.e. does not follow the third law of dynamics, with observable
effects on group formation and velocity. We successfully compared the
predictions of the model with observations of real world pedestrian behaviour.
We then studied the effect of crowd density on group dynamics. We verified that
the average effect of crowd density may be modelled by adding a harmonic term
to the group potential. The model predictions, which include ""phase
transitions"" in the group configuration, are again confirmed, at least in the
observed density range, by a comparison with real world data. Until now we had
averaged all pedestrian data collected in a given environmental setting without
differentiating on group composition and social roles. In this work we study

from asteroid collisions and cometary activities drift to the Earth orbit due
to the Poynting-Robertson drag. We analyzed the thermal emission from IDPs that
was observed by the first Japanese infrared astronomical satellite, AKARI. The
observed surface brightness in the trailing direction of the Earth orbit is
3.7% greater than that in the leading direction in the $9{\rm \mu m}$ band and
3.0% in the $18{\rm \mu m}$ band. In order to reveal dust properties causing
the leading-trailing surface brightness asymmetry, we numerically integrated
orbits of the Sun, the Earth, and a dust particle as a restricted three-body
problem including radiation from the Sun. The initial orbits of particles are
determined according to the orbits of main-belt asteroids or Jupiter-family
comets. The orbital trapping in mean motion resonances results in a significant
leading-trailing asymmetry so that intermediate sized dust (~10-100${\rm \mu
m}$) produces a greater asymmetry than the zodiacal light has. The
leading-trailing surface brightness difference integrated over the size
distribution of the asteroidal dust is obtained to be the values of 27.7% and
25.3% in the $9{\rm \mu m}$ and $18{\rm \mu m}$ bands, respectively. In
contrast, the brightness difference for cometary dust is calculated as the
values of 3.6% and 3.1% in the $9{\rm \mu m}$ and $18{\rm \mu m}$ bands,
respectively, if the maximum dust radius is set to be $s_{\rm max} = 3000{\rm
\mu m}$. Taking into account these values and their errors, we conclude that
the contribution of asteroidal dust to the zodiacal infrared emission is less

witness Bell correlated states, i.e. states violating a Bell inequality, in

an arbitrary number of measurement settings, two outcomes per party and one-
and two-body correlators only. Based on these inequalities, we then build up
improved witnesses able to detect Bell-correlated states in many-body systems
using two collective measurements only. These witnesses can potentially detect
Bell correlations in states with an arbitrarily low amount of spin squeezing.

conclude that a measured state is Bell-correlated.

fixed points of the renormalization group flow. This implies a typical energy
scale that grows, approaching the transition, as a power of the correlation
length, thus leading to enormously large time-scales as expected from
experiments and simulations. These fixed points exist only in dimensions larger

spin-glasses in a field and models of glasses and relates it to the presence of
avoided critical points.

distribution given a rare event of interest. This feature enhances sample
efficiency compared with the crude Monte Carlo method. Moreover, our method has
the consistency and asymptotic normality, and is widely applicable to various
risk models having joint loss density. Our numerical experiments based on

orbital-period derivative at a rate of $\dot{P}/P\sim1.1\times10^{-7}$ ${\rm

However, the recent analysis of the 16 ${\rm yr}$ data from \textit{Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer} and other historical records yielded a negative orbital-period
derivative in the past $35$ yr. In this work, we propose an evolutionary
circumbinary (CB) disk model to account for this anomalous orbital-period
derivative. 4U 1820-30 was known to undergo superbust events caused by runaway
thermal nuclear burning on the neutron star. We assume that for a small
fraction of the superbursts, part of the ejected material may form a CB disk
around the binary. If the recurrence time of such superbursts is $\sim10,000$
yr and $\sim10$% of the ejected mass feeds a CB disk, the abrupt
angular-momentum loss causes a temporary orbital shrink, and the donor's radius
and its Roche-lobe radius do not keep in step. Driven by mass transfer and
angular-momentum loss, the binary would adjust its orbital parameters to
recover a new stable stage. Based on the theoretical analysis and numerical
simulation, we find that the required feed mass at the CB disk is approximately
$\sim 10^{-8}$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$.

lattice structure. Recent advances in van der Waals solids, artificial crystals
with controlled stacking of two-dimensional (2D) atomic films, have enabled the
creation of materials with novel electronic structures. In particular, stacking
graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) introduces moir\'e superlattice that
fundamentally modifies graphene's band structure and gives rise to secondary
Dirac points (SDPs). Here we find that the formation of a moir\'e superlattice
in graphene on hBN yields new, unexpected consequences: a set of tertiary Dirac
points (TDPs) emerge, which give rise to additional sets of Landau levels when
the sample is subjected to an external magnetic field. Our observations hint at
the formation of a hidden Kekul\'e superstructure on top of the moir\'e

investigated to learn the codewords, with which, any given texture image can be

Accepted version in Phys Rev C",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.96.014003",,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The energy weighted sum rules of the single-particle spectral
functions provide a quantitative understanding of the fragmentation of nuclear
states due to short-range and tensor correlations. Purpose: The aim of this
paper is to compare on a quantitative basis the single-particle spectral
function generated by different nuclear hamiltonians in symmetric nuclear
matter using the first three energy-weighted moments. Method: The spectral
functions are calculated in the framework of the self-consistent Green's
function approach at finite temperature within a ladder resummation scheme. We
analyze the first three moments of the spectral function and connect these to
the correlations induced by the interactions between the nucleons. In
particular, the variance of the spectral function is directly linked to the
dispersive contribution of the self-energy. The discussion is centred around
two- and three-body chiral nuclear interactions, with and without
renormalization, but we also provide results obtained with the traditional
phase-shift-equivalent CD-Bonn and Av18 potentials. Results: The variance of
the spectral function is particularly sensitive to the short-range structure of
the force, with hard-core interactions providing large variances. Chiral forces
yield variances which are an order of magnitude smaller and, when tamed using
the similarity renormalization group, the variance reduces significantly and in
proportion to the renormalization scale. The presence of three-body forces does
not substantially affect the results. Conclusions: The first three moments of
the spectral function are useful tools in analysing the importance of
correlations in nuclear ground states. In particular, the second-order moment
provides a direct insight into dispersive contributions to the self-energy and
its value is indicative of the fragmentation of single-particle states.

achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement

functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning:
the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU).
The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by
its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using
on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and
softmax action selection with simple annealing can be competitive with DQN,
without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed
approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic
SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10$\times$10 board, using TD($\lambda$)
learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in

term $\eta$ in the right-hand side is a regularized space-time white noise. The
exponential of $h$ -- its so-called Cole-Hopf transform -- is known to satisfy
a linear PDE with multiplicative noise. We prove a large-scale diffusive limit
for the solution, in particular a time-integrated heat-kernel behavior for the
covariance in a parabolic scaling.
  The proof is based on a rigorous implementation of K. Wilson's
renormalization group scheme. A double cluster/momentum-decoupling expansion
allows for perturbative estimates of the bare resolvent of the Cole-Hopf linear
PDE in the small-field region where the noise is not too large, following the
broad lines of Iagolnitzer-Magnen. Standard large deviation estimates for

However, without careful consideration of convergence criteria and selection of

approximate Bayesian computation, despite being computationally intensive,
results in independent, identically distributed samples from the approximated

of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We demonstrate that a
purely axisymmetric, two-dimensional geometry cannot reproduce a loop in the
Stokes Q-U diagram, i.e., a variation of the polarization angles along the
velocities associated with the absorption lines. On the contrary,
three-dimensional (3D) clumpy structures naturally reproduce the loop. The fact
that the loop is commonly observed in stripped-envelope SNe suggests that SN
ejecta generally have a 3D structure. We study the degree of line polarization
as a function of the absorption depth for various 3D clumpy models with
different clump sizes and covering factors. Comparison between the calculated
and observed degree of line polarization indicates that a typical size of the
clump is relatively large, >~ 25 % of the photospheric radius. Such large-scale
clumps are similar to those observed in the SN remnant Cassiopeia A. Given the
small size of the observed sample, the covering factor of the clumps is only
weakly constrained (~ 5-80 %). The presence of large-scale clumpy structure
suggests that the large-scale convection or standing accretion shock
instability takes place at the onset of the explosion.

the entire surface is used as an intelligent receiving antenna array. Under the
condition that the surface area is sufficiently large, the received signal
after matched-filtering (MF) can be well approximated by an intersymbol
interference (ISI) channel where channel taps are closely related to a sinc
function. Based on such an approximation, we have derived the capacities for
both one-dimensional (terminals on a line) and high dimensional (terminals on a
plane or in a cube) terminal-deployments. In particular, we analyze the
normalized capacity $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$, measured in nats/s/Hz/m$^2$, under the
constraint that the transmit power per m$^2$, $\bar{P}$, is fixed. We show that
when the user-density increases, the limit of $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$, achieved as
the wavelength $\lambda$ approaches 0, is $\bar{P}/(2N_0)$ nats/s/Hz/m$^2$,
where $N_0$ is the spatial power spectral density (PSD) of noise. In addition,
we also show that the number of signal dimensions is $2/\lambda$ per meter

deployed surface for two and three dimensional terminal-deployments.

serious concerns about the suitability of p values for this purpose. An
alternative approach is to cite confidence intervals for a statistic of

Here, I suggest how the framework used for confidence intervals could easily be
extended to derive confidence levels, or ""tentative probabilities"", for
hypotheses. I also outline four quick methods for estimating these. This allows
researchers to state their confidence in a hypothesis as a direct probability,
instead of circuitously by p values referring to an unstated, hypothetical null
hypothesis. The inevitable difficulties of statistical inference mean that
these probabilities can only be tentative, but probabilities are the natural
way to express uncertainties, so, arguably, researchers using statistical
methods have an obligation to estimate how probable their hypotheses are by the
best available method. Otherwise misinterpretations will fill the void. Key

strongly reducing the computational cost of these two approaches with respect

extract single-particle properties of nuclei, and the adiabatic (AD)
approximation is often used to simply treat the deuteron breakup states.
Purpose: The primary goal is to examine the validity of the AD approximation
for the ($d,p$) reaction systematically. We clarify also the role of the
closed-channels often ignored in the description of breakup reactions. Methods:
We calculate the ($d,p$) cross sections with the continuum-discretized
coupled-channels method (CDCC) for 128 reactions systems and compare the
results with those obtained by the CDCC calculation with the AD approximation.
Effect of the closed channels are investigated by ignoring the closed channels
in CDCC. Results: The AD approximation affects in general the ($d,p$) cross
section by less than 20 %, but some exceptional nonadiabatic cases for which
the AD approximation breaks down are found. The closed channels turn out to
give significant effects on the cross section at deuteron energies less than
about 10 MeV. Conclusions: The use of the AD approximation in the description
of the ($d,p$) reaction can be justified in many cases, with the uncertainty of
less than about 20 %. The existence of some nonadiabatic cases nevertheless
should be realized. The neglect of the closed channels without confirming the
convergence of the CDCC result is not recommended.

the few-cycle regime, as the pulse spatio-temporal structure may be highly

as an additional control parameter to modify the generated XUV radiation. We
present experiments where few-cycle pulses are focused by a singlet lens in a
Kr gas jet. The chromatic distribution of focal lengths allows us to tune HHG
spectra by changing the relative singlet-target distance. Interestingly, we
also show that the degree of chromatic aberration needed to this control does
not degrade substantially the harmonic conversion efficiency, still allowing
for the generation of supercontinua with the chirped-pulse scheme, demonstrated
previously for achromatic focussing. We back up our experiments with
theoretical simulations reproducing the experimental HHG results depending on
diverse parameters (input pulse spectral phase, pulse duration, focus position)
and proving that, under the considered parameters, the attosecond pulse train
remains very similar to the achromatic case, even showing cases of isolated

We derive in this work the actual mass of NGC 4337, one of the few open
clusters in the Milky Way inner disk that managed to survive for about 1.5 Gyr.
We derive its mass in two different ways. First, we exploit an unpublished
photometric data set in the UBVI passbands to estimate -using star counts- the
cluster luminosity profile, and luminosity and mass function, and hence its
actual mass both from the luminosity profile and from the mass function.This
data-set is also used to infer crucial cluster parameters, as the cluster
half-mass radius and distance. Second, we make use of a large survey of cluster
star radial velocities to derive dynamical estimates for the cluster mass.
Under the assumption of virial equilibrium and neglecting the external
gravitational field leads to values for the mass significantly larger than
those obtained by mean of observed density distribution or with the mass
function but still marginally compatible with the inferred values of the
invisible mass in form of both low mass stars or remnants of high mass stars in
the cluster. Finally, we derive the cluster initial mass by computing the mass
loss experienced by the cluster during its lifetime, and adopting the various
estimates of the actual mass.

short-time horizon when $T_u$ is relatively small with respect to $u$; (B)
moderate- or long-time horizon when $T_u$ is asymptotically much larger than
$u$. As a by-product, some implications for the speed of convergence to
stationarity of the considered model are discussed.

transport properties in spatially inhomogeneous states close to the simple (or
uniform) shear flow. The kinetic equation is based on the inelastic Boltzmann
(for low density gases) with the presence of a viscous drag force that models
the influence of the interstitial gas phase on the dynamics of grains. A normal
solution is obtained via a Chapman-Enskog-like expansion around a (local) shear
flow distribution which retains all the hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate.
To first-order in the expansion, the transport coefficients characterizing
momentum and heat transport around shear flow are given in terms of the
solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately
solved by using a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation. To simplify the
analysis, the steady-state conditions when viscous heating is compensated by
the cooling terms arising from viscous friction and collisional dissipation are
considered to get the explicit forms of the set of generalized transport
coefficients. The shear-rate dependence of some of the transport coefficients
of the set is illustrated for several values of the coefficient of restitution.

given element. However, these features are not always taken into account in
approaches where classical theories or approximate quantum models are
preferred. In this work we present an exact three-dimensional wave packet
propagation treatment for simulating the passage of atoms through periodic 2D

through graphdiyne as well as through a holey graphene model. For
He-graphdiyne, estimations based on tunneling-corrected transition state theory
are correct: both tunneling and ZPE effects are very important but competition
between each other leads to a moderately small $^4$He/$^3$He selectivity. Thus,
formulations that neglect one or another quantum effect are inappropriate. For
the transport of He isotopes through leaky graphene, the computed transmission
probabilities are highly structured suggesting widespread selective adsorption
resonances and the resulting rate coefficients and selectivity ratios are not
in agreement with predictions from transition state theory. Present approach
serves as a benchmark for studies of the range of validity of more approximate

systems has received considerable attention over the past decade, with a
handful of powerful algorithms being introduced. In this paper we tackle the
theoretical analysis of the recently proposed {\it nonlinear} population Monte
Carlo (NPMC). This is an iterative importance sampling scheme whose key
features, compared to conventional importance samplers, are (i) the approximate
computation of the importance weights (IWs) assigned to the Monte Carlo samples
and (ii) the nonlinear transformation of these IWs in order to prevent the
degeneracy problem that flaws the performance of conventional importance
samplers. The contribution of the present paper is a rigorous proof of
convergence of the nonlinear IS (NIS) scheme as the number of Monte Carlo
samples, $M$, increases. Our analysis reveals that the NIS approximation errors
converge to 0 almost surely and with the optimal Monte Carlo rate of
$M^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Moreover, we prove that this is achieved even when the mean
estimation error of the IWs remains constant, a property that has been termed
{\it exact approximation} in the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature. We
illustrate these theoretical results by means of a computer simulation example
involving the estimation of the parameters of a state-space model typically
used for target tracking.

generally regarded as being unusually deep and long. That minimum is being
followed by one of the smallest amplitude cycles in recent history. We perform
an in-depth analysis of this minimum with helioseismology. We use Global
Oscillation Network Group (GONG) data to demonstrate that the frequencies of
helioseismic oscillations are a sensitive probe of the Sun's magnetic field:
The frequencies of the helioseismic oscillations were found to be
systematically lower in the minimum following Cycle 23 than in the minimum
preceding it. This difference is statistically significant and may indicate
that the Sun's global magnetic field was weaker in the minimum following Cycle
23. The size of the shift in oscillation frequencies between the two minima is
dependent on the frequency of the oscillation and takes the same functional
form as the frequency dependence observed when the frequencies at cycle maximum
are compared with the cycle-minimum frequencies. This implies that the same
near-surface magnetic perturbation is responsible. Finally, we determine that
the difference in the mean magnetic field between the minimum preceding Cycle
23 and that following it is approximately 1G.

points is identifying a viable mechanism to convert the Poynting flux into the
kinetic energy of the plasma beyond equipartition. A promising candidate is the
kink instability, which deforms the body of the jet through helical
perturbations. Since the detailed structure of real jets is unknown, we explore
a large family of cylindrical, force-free equilibria to get robust conclusions.
We find that the growth rate of the instability depends primarily on two
parameters: (i) the gradient of the poloidal magnetic field; (ii) the Lorentz
factor of the perturbation, which is closely related to the velocity of the
plasma. We provide a simple fitting formula for the growth rate of the
instability. As a tentative application, we use our results to interpret the
dynamics of the jet in the nearby active galaxy M87. We show that the kink
instability becomes non-linear at a distance from the central black hole
comparable to where the jet stops accelerating. Hence (at least for this
object), the kink instability of the jet is a good candidate to drive the
transition from a Poynting-dominated to a kinetic-energy-dominated flow.

most likely due to the challenges of achieving a lubricating and protecting

that this can be achieved by efficiently increasing the exfoliation degree of

the wear resistance of Si3N4 composites can be increased by about twenty times,
the friction coefficient reduced to nearly its half, while the other mechanical

effect. To probe the relationship between the coronal properties with a
spectral type of ultra-fast rotators with rotation period P < 1d, we analyse

low-mass rapid rotators of spectral types G9-M1. We investigate the temporal
evolution of coronal properties like the temperatures, emission measures,
abundances, densities and the morphology of the involved coronal structures. We
find two distinguishable levels of activity in the XMM-Newton observation of
LO~Peg, which shows significant X-ray variability both in phase and amplitude,
implying the presence of an evolving active region on the surface. The X-ray
flux varies by 28%, possibly due to rotational modulation. During our
observation, a large X-ray flare with a peak X-ray luminosity of 2E30 erg/s and
an energy of 7.3E33 erg was observed. At the flare onset we obtain clear
signatures for the occurrence of the Neupert effect. The flare plasma also
shows an enhancement of iron by a factor of 2 during the rise and peak phase of
the flare. Our modeling analysis suggests that the scale size of the flaring
X-ray plasma is smaller than 0.5 R_star. Further, the flare loop length appears
to be smaller than the pressure scale height of the flaring plasma. Our studies
show that the X-ray properties of the LO~Peg are very similar to those of other

under a small droplet on a liquid is proposed. This strategy is based on the
notion of effective surface tension. The droplets show self-propulsion in
straight line trajectories in a manner which can be ascribed to a Marangoni
effect. Surprisingly, self-propelled droplets can become immersed beneath the
undisturbed water surface. This phenomenon is reasoned to be drag-inducing and
might provide a basis for refining observations in previous work.

We also tested the effect of including a complete atmosphere in the stellar

degree modes were derived and identified using classical methods and compared
with the results obtained from stellar models computed with the Toulouse Geneva

Lorentz-violating fermions that are described by the minimal Standard-Model
Extension (SME). To date, most considerations of this important hypothetical
process have been restricted to Lorentz-violating photons, as the necessary
theoretical tools for the SME fermion sector have not been available. With
their development in a very recent paper, we are now in a position to compute
the decay rates based on a modified Dirac theory. Two realizations of the
Cherenkov process are studied. In the first scenario, the spin projection of
the incoming fermion is assumed to be conserved, and in the second, the spin
projection is allowed to flip. The first type of process is shown to be still
forbidden for the dimensionful $a$ and $b$ coefficients where there are strong
indications that it is energetically disallowed for the $H$ coefficients, as
well. However, it is rendered possible for the dimensionless $c$, $d$, $e$,
$f$, and $g$ coefficients. For large initial fermion energies, the decay rates
for the $c$ and $d$ coefficients were found to grow linearly with momentum and
to be linearly suppressed by the smallness of the Lorentz-violating coefficient
where for the $e$, $f$, and $g$ coefficients this suppression is even
quadratic. The decay rates vanish in the vicinity of the threshold, as
expected. The decay including a fermion spin flip plays a role for the
spin-nondegenerate operators and it was found to occur for the dimensionful $b$
and $H$ coefficients as well as for the dimensionless $d$ and $g$. The
characteristics of this process differ much from the properties of the
spin-conserving one, e.g., there is no threshold. Based on experimental data of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, new constraints on Lorentz violation in the
quark sector are obtained from the thresholds.

magnetospheric activity. Strong magnetic fields are responsible for quantum
effects, an essential ingredient to produce leptonic pairs and the subsequent
broadband radiation. The variety of electromagnetic field topologies could lead
to the observed diversity of neutron star classes. Thus it is important to
include multipolar components to a presumably dominant dipolar magnetic field.
Exact analytical solutions for these multipoles in Newtonian gravity have been
computed in recent literature. However, flat spacetime is not adequate to
describe physics in the immediate surrounding of neutron stars. We generalize
the multipole expressions to the strong gravity regime by using a slowly
rotating metric approximation such as the one expected around neutron stars.
Approximate formulas for the electromagnetic field including frame dragging are
computed from which we estimate the Poynting flux and the braking index.
Corrections to leading order in compactness and spin parameter are presented.
As far as spindown luminosity is concerned, it is shown that frame dragging
remains irrelevant. For high order multipoles starting from the quadrupole, the
electric part can radiate more efficiently than the magnetic part. Both
analytical and numerical tools are employed.

displacements have been measured using toroidally localized high resolution
diagnostics and rigidly rotating n = 2 MP-fields with various applied poloidal
mode spectra. These measurements are compared to non-linear 3D ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibria calculated by VMEC. Comprehensive
comparisons have been conducted, which consider for instance plasma movements
due to the position control system, attenuation due to internal conductors and
changes in the edge pressure profiles. VMEC accurately reproduces the amplitude
of the displacement and its dependencies on the applied poloidal mode spectra.
Quantitative agreement is found around the low field side (LFS) midplane. The
response at the plasma top is qualitatively compared. The measured and
predicted displacements at the plasma top maximize when the applied spectra is
optimized for ELM-mitigation. The predictions from the vacuum modeling
generally fails to describe the displacement at the LFS midplane as well as at

binary firing rates and can be driven by noise with any distribution. We find
analytical expressions of the conditional and stationary joint probability
distributions of the membrane potentials and the firing rates. The conditional
probability distribution of the firing rates allows us to introduce a new
learning rule to store safely, under the presence of noise, point and cyclic
attractors, with important applications in the field of content-addressable
memories. Furthermore, we study the neuronal dynamics in terms of the
bifurcation structure of the network. We derive analytically examples of the
codimension one and codimension two bifurcation diagrams of the network, which
describe how the neuronal dynamics changes with the external stimuli. In
particular, we find that the network may undergo transitions among multistable
regimes, oscillatory behavior elicited by asymmetric synaptic connections, and
various forms of spontaneous symmetry-breaking. On the other hand, the joint
probability distributions allow us to calculate analytically the higher-order
correlation structure of the network, which reveals neuronal regimes where,
statistically, the membrane potentials and the firing rates are either
synchronous or asynchronous. Our results are valid for networks composed of an
arbitrary number of neurons, but for completeness we also derive the network
equations in the mean-field limit and we study analytically their local

very high cadence with the Halpha Solar Telescope for Argentina (HASTA) in
association with an X1.0 flare (SOL2014-03-29T17:48). Several other phenomena
took place in connection with this event, such as low coronal waves and a
coronal mass ejection (CME). We analyze the association between the Moreton
wave and the EUV signatures observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These include their low-coronal
surface-imprint, and the signatures of the full wave and shock dome propagating
outward in the corona. We also study their relation to the white-light CME. We
perform a kinematic analysis by tracking the wavefronts in several directions.
This analysis reveals a high-directional dependence of accelerations and speeds
determined from data at various wavelengths. We speculate that a region of open
magnetic field lines northward of our defined radiant point sets favorable
conditions for the propagation of a coronal magnetohydrodynamic shock in this
direction. The hypothesis that the Moreton wavefront is produced by a coronal
shock-wave that pushes the chromosphere downward is supported by the high
compression ratio in that region. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geometrical
model to explain the observed wavefronts as the chromospheric and low-coronal
traces of an expanding and outward-traveling bubble intersecting the Sun. The
results of the model are in agreement with the coronal shock-wave being
generated by a 3D piston that expands at the speed of the associated rising
filament. The piston is attributed to the fast ejection of the filament-CME
ensemble, also consistent with the good match between the speed profiles of the
low-coronal and white-light shock-waves.

mathematics, including combinatorial optimization, polyhedral combinatorics,
communication complexity, and statistics. In this paper, we present a study of
some 2-level polytopes arising in combinatorial settings. Our first
contribution is proving that v(P)*f(P) is upper bounded by d*2^(d+1), for a
large collection of families of such polytopes P. Here v(P) (resp. f(P)) is the
number of vertices (resp. facets) of P, and d is its dimension. Whether this
holds for all 2-level polytopes was asked in [Bohn et al., ESA 2015], and
experimental results from [Fiorini et al., ISCO 2016] showed it true up to
dimension 7. The key to most of our proofs is a deeper understanding of the
relations among those polytopes and their underlying combinatorial structures.
This leads to a number of results that we believe to be of independent
interest: a trade-off formula for the number of cliques and stable sets in a
graph; a description of stable matching polytopes as affine projections of
certain order polytopes; and a linear-size description of the base polytope of
matroids that are 2-level in terms of cuts of an associated tree.

an efficient out-of-place matrix transpose. We evaluate the performance of MTNN

96\% of prediction accuracy with very low computational overhead, which results
in an average of 54\% performance improvement on a range of NT operations. To
further evaluate the impact of MTNN on the training process of deep neural

significance of signals belonging to this broad astrophysical class against the
noise background. Alternatively, at a given level of mis-classification of
noise events, we can detect about 1/4 more of the total signal population. We
also show that a more general strategy of signal classification can actually be
performed, by testing the ability of artificial neural networks in
discriminating different signal classes. The possible impact on future
observations by the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is discussed by analysing
recoloured noise from previous LIGO-Virgo data with coherent WaveBurst, one of
the flagship pipelines dedicated to all-sky searches for transient
gravitational waves.

compactifications of string theory, M-theory, and F-theory to various
dimensions. This work introduces the mathematical machinery to derive the
complete moduli dependence of the periods of non-trivial three-forms for
fourfolds realized as hypersurfaces in toric ambient spaces. It sets the stage
to determine Picard-Fuchs-type differential equations and integral expressions
for these forms. The key tool is the observation that non-trivial three-forms
on hypersurfaces in toric ambient spaces always stem from divisors that are
build out of toric resolution trees fibered over Riemann surfaces. The
three-form periods are then non-trivially related to the one-form periods of
these surfaces. In general, the three-form periods are known to vary
holomorphically over the complex structure moduli space and play an important
role in the effective actions arising in fourfold compactifications. We discuss
two explicit example fourfolds for F-theory compactifications in which the
three-form periods determine axion decay constants.

suppressed gradually with increasing pressure and disappears completely above
2.0 GPa. In contrast, the magnetic order of Eu sublattice persists over the
whole investigated pressure range up to 14 GPa, yet displaying a non-monotonic
variation with pressure. With the increase of the hydrostatic pressure, the
magnetic state of Eu evolves from the canted antiferromagnetic structure in the
ground state, via a pure ferromagnetic structure under the intermediate
pressure, finally to a possible ""novel"" antiferromagnetic structure under the
high pressure. The strong ferromagnetism of Eu coexists with the
pressure-induced superconductivity around 2 GPa. The change of the magnetic
state of Eu in Eu(Fe$_{0.925}$Co$_{0.075}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ upon the application

We find that N-body simulations for LambdaCDM cosmology starting from

investigate the reliability of observable properties, in particular filament
mass and width, under different simulation conditions like magnetic field
orientation and cosmic ray ionisation rate. We find that filament widths of
$\sim$0.1 pc can be probed with both line and continuum emission observations
with a high accuracy (deviations $\leq$ 20%). However, the width of more narrow
filaments can be significantly overestimated by up to a factor of a few. Masses
obtained via the dust emission are accurate within a few percent whereas the
masses inferred from molecular line emission observations deviate from the
actual mass by up to a factor of 10 and show large differences for different
$J$ transitions. The inaccurate estimate of filament masses and widths of
narrow filaments using molecular line observations can be attributed to (i) the
non-isothermal state of the filaments, (ii) optical depth effects, and (iii)
the subthermally excited state of CO, while inclination effects and opacity
correction only influence the obtained masses and widths by less than 50%.
Both, mass and width estimates, can be improved by using two isotopes to
correct for the optical depth. Since gas and dust temperature generally differ
(by up to 25 K), the filaments appear more gravitationally unstable if the (too
low) dust temperature is used for the stability analysis.

concrete ways to both measure the efficiency of markets and find inefficiencies
in large markets. The theory leads to new methods for testing the famous
efficient markets hypothesis that do not suffer from the joint-hypothesis
problem that has plagued past work. Our theory suggests metrics that can be
used to compare the efficiency of one market with another, to find
inefficiencies that may be profitable to exploit, and to evaluate the impact of
policy and regulations on market efficiency.
  A market's efficiency is tied to its ability to communicate information
relevant to market participants. Market connectivity calculates the speed and
reliability with which this communication is carried out via trade in the
market. We model the market by a network called the trade network, which can be
computed by recording transactions in the market over a fixed interval of time.
The nodes of the network correspond to participants in the market. Every pair
of nodes that trades in the market is connected by an edge that is weighted by
the rate of trade, and associated with a vector that represents the type of
item that is bought or sold.
  We evaluate the ability of the market to communicate by considering how it
deals with shocks. A shock is a change in the beliefs of market participants
about the value of the products that they trade. We compute the effect of every
potential significant shock on trade in the market. We give mathematical
definitions for a few concepts that measure the ability of the market to
effectively dissipate shocks.

Casimir effect,
however, is often presented as a counterexample, giving rise to a conceptual
confusion. To resolve the confusion we study foundational aspects of Casimir
effect at a qualitative level, but also at a quantitative level within a simple
toy model with only 3 degrees of freedom. In particular, we point out that
Casimir vacuum is not a state without photons, and not a ground state for a
Hamiltonian that can describe Casimir force. Instead, Casimir vacuum can be
related to the photon vacuum by a non-trivial Bogoliubov transformation, and it
is a ground state only for an effective Hamiltonian describing Casimir plates
at a fixed distance. At the fundamental microscopic level, Casimir force is
best viewed as a manifestation of van der Waals forces.

fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default
state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle
of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological

collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless
constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and
ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their
ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can
be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints...

Combining them with IRAM CO(1-0) measurements, we establish scaling relations
between integrated and molecular region [CII]/CO(1-0) luminosity ratios as a
function of integrated galaxy properties. A Bayesian analysis reveals that only
two parameters, metallicity and offset from the star formation main sequence,
$\Delta$MS, are needed to quantify variations in the luminosity ratio;
metallicity describes the total dust content available to shield CO from UV
radiation, while $\Delta$MS describes the strength of this radiation field. We
connect the [CII]/CO luminosity ratio to the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and
find a multivariate conversion function $\alpha_{CO}$, which can be used up to
z~2.5. This function depends primarily on metallicity, with a second order
dependence on $\Delta$MS. We apply this to the full xCOLD GASS and PHIBSS1
surveys and investigate molecular gas scaling relations. We find a flattening
of the relation between gas mass fraction and stellar mass at
logM$_\ast$/M$_\odot$<10. While the molecular gas depletion time varies with
sSFR, it is mostly independent of mass, indicating that the low L$_{CO}$/SFR
ratios long observed in low mass galaxies are entirely due to photodissociation

vapour cushion, which is sourced at the liquid-vapour interface from
evaporation caused by the hot substrate below. It has been experimentally
observed that when two or more Leidenfrost drops approach one another, there is
a short-range repulsion that can prevent coalescence. In the present work, we
investigate the coalescence process of initially momentum-less Leidenfrost
drops. This is carried out by numerically simulating two-dimensional systems of
liquid and vapour using the recently developed dynamic van der Waals theory, in
which the two-phase hydrodynamics is coupled with liquid-vapour transition. It
is confirmed that Leidenfrost drops experience a remarkably strong short-range
repulsion, due to a build-up of vapour in the common space under both drops.
This resistive force scales in a similar manner to the pressure-sourced force
from the vapour layer under a single drop, in concurrence with intuition, with
good agreement seen in the simulation results. A threshold drop size therefore
exists in order for an applied horizontal acceleration to overcome the
repulsion, while only very small drops are predicted to experience significant
viscous effects.

manifolds, provide an example and obtain certain conditions for such maps to be
totally geodesic. We also give a sufficient condition for a map between
metallic Riemannian manifolds to be harmonic map. Then we investigate the
constancy of certain maps between metallic Riemannian manifolds and various
manifolds by imposing the holomorphic-like condition. Moreover, we check the
reverse case and show that some such maps are constant if there is a condition
for this.

ion-counting wall-less nanodosimeter by monoenergetic carbon ions with energies
between 45 MeV and 150 MeV were measured at the TANDEM-ALPI ion accelerator
facility complex of the LNL INFN in Legnaro. Those produced by monoenergetic
helium ions with energies between 2 MeV and 20 MeV were measured at the
accelerator facilities of PTB and with a 241Am alpha particle source. C3H8 was
used as the target gas. The ionisation cluster size distributions were measured
in narrow beam geometry with the primary beam passing the target volume at
specified distances from its centre, and in broad beam geometry with a fan-like
primary beam. By applying a suitable drift time window, the effective size of
the target volume was adjusted to match the size of a DNA segment. The measured
data were compared with the results of simulations obtained with the PTB Monte
Carlo code PTra. Before the comparison, the simulated cluster size
distributions were corrected with respect to the background of additional
ionisations produced in the transport system of the ionised target gas
molecules. Measured and simulated characteristics of the particle track
structure are in good agreement for both types of primary particles and for
both types of the irradiation geometry.

common traits, including similarities in IT structures, knowledge generating

described by symmetric tensor gauge fields, which naturally couple to particles
of restricted mobility, such as fractons. We focus on a minimal toy model of a
rank 2 tensor gauge field, consisting of fractons coupled to an emergent
graviton (massless spin-2 excitation). We show how to reconcile the immobility
of fractons with the expected gravitational behavior of the model. First, we
reformulate the fracton phenomenon in terms of an emergent center of mass
quantum number, and we show how an effective attraction arises from the
principles of locality and conservation of center of mass. This interaction
between fractons is always attractive and can be recast in geometric language,
with a geodesic-like formulation, thereby satisfying the expected properties of
a gravitational force. This force will generically be short-ranged, but we
discuss how the power-law behavior of Newtonian gravity can arise under certain
conditions. We then show that, while an isolated fracton is immobile, fractons
are endowed with finite inertia by the presence of a large-scale distribution
of other fractons, in a concrete manifestation of Mach's principle. Our
formalism provides suggestive hints that matter plays a fundamental role, not
only in perturbing, but in creating the background space in which it
propagates.

required potentially unlimited financial subsidy, however, making them
impractical. In this work, we design an adaptively-growing prediction market
with a bounded financial subsidy, while achieving privacy, incentives to
produce accurate predictions, and precision in the sense that market prices are
not heavily impacted by the added privacy-preserving noise. We briefly discuss
how our mechanism can extend to the data-purchasing setting, and its
relationship to traditional learning algorithms.
