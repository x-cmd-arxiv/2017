directivity in a small antenna is closely connected with a narrow impedance
bandwidth. The relation between bandwidth and a desired directivity is still
not fully understood, not even for small antennas. Initial investigations in
this direction has related the radius of a circumscribing sphere to the
directivity, and bounds on the Q-factor has also been derived for a partial
directivity in a given direction. In this paper we derive lower bounds on the
Q-factor for a total desired directivity for an arbitrarily shaped antenna in a

set of $p \times p$ symmetric positive-definite matrices, based on

Sym}^+(p)$, defined by eigenvalue multiplicities, and fibers of the
""eigen-composition"" map $F:M(p):=SO(p)\times{\rm Diag}^+(p)\to{\rm Sym}^+(p)$.
When $M(p)$ is equipped with a suitable Riemannian metric, the fiber structure
leads to notions of scaling-rotation distance between $X,Y\in {\rm Sym}^+(p)$,
the distance in $M(p)$ between fibers $F^{-1}(X)$ and $F^{-1}(Y)$, and minimal
smooth scaling-rotation (MSSR) curves, images in ${\rm Sym}^+(p)$ of
minimal-length geodesics connecting two fibers. In this paper we study the
geometry of the triple $(M(p),F,{\rm Sym}^+(p))$, focusing on some basic
questions: For which $X,Y$ is there a unique MSSR curve from $X$ to $Y$? More
generally, what is the set ${\cal M}(X,Y)$ of MSSR curves from $X$ to $Y$? This
set is influenced by two potential types of non-uniqueness. We translate the
question of whether the second type can occur into a question about the
geometry of Grassmannians $G_m({\bf R}^p)$, with $m$ even, that we answer for
$p\leq 4$ and $p\geq 11$. Our method of proof also yields an interesting
half-angle formula concerning principal angles between subspaces of ${\bf R}^p$

MSSR curves and scaling-rotation distance that we establish here underpin the
explicit $p=3$ results in Groisser et al. (2017). Addressing the

IEEE 802.11 is enriched with IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g. More
recently, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad are introduced with
enhancements to the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC)
sublayer to provide much higher data rates and thus these amendments are called
High Throughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). For both standards, PHY is enhanced with
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies, channel bonding,
short guard intervals (SGI), enhanced modulation and coding schemes (MCS). At
the same time, MAC layer overhead is reduced by introducing frame aggregation
and block acknowledgement technologies. However, existing studies reveal that
although PHY and MAC enhancements promise to improve physical data rate
significantly, they yield negative impact over upper layer protocols -- mainly
for reliable end-to-end transport/application layer protocols. As a
consequence, a large number of schools have focused researches on HT-WLANs to
improve the coordination among PHY/MAC and upper layer protocols and thus,
boost up the performance benefit. In this survey, we discuss the impact of

$-146.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with 4.52 km s$^{-1}$ standard deviation, which is in good

the human body moving in space and the biomechanics of the muscles generating
the forces acting on the body under sophisticated sensory-motor control. The
characterization of the performance of human movements is a problem with
important applications in clinical and sports research. One way to characterize
movement performance is through measures of energy efficiency that relate the
mechanical energy of the body and metabolic energy expended by the muscles.
Such a characterization provides information about the performance of a
movement insofar as subjects select movements with the aim of maximizing the
energy efficiency. We examine the case of the energy efficiency of asynchronous
arm-cranking doing external mechanical work, that is, using the arms to turn an
asynchronous arm-crank that performs external mechanical work. We construct a
metabolic energy model and use it estimate how cranking may be performed with
maximum energy efficiency, and recover the intuitive result that for larger
external forces the crank-handles should be placed as far from the center of
the crank as is comfortable for the subject to turn. We further examine
mechanical advantage in asynchronous arm-cranking by constructing an idealized
system that is driven by a crank and which involves an adjustable mechanical
advantage, and analyze the case in which the avg. frequency is fixed and derive
the mechanical advantages that maximize energy efficiency.

encoded as software and system action templates. Compared to existing
end-to-end approaches, HCNs considerably reduce the amount of training data
required, while retaining the key benefit of inferring a latent representation
of dialog state. In addition, HCNs can be optimized with supervised learning,
reinforcement learning, or a mixture of both. HCNs attain state-of-the-art
performance on the bAbI dialog dataset, and outperform two commercially
deployed customer-facing dialog systems.

hypothesize that this is due to the dependence of model layer inputs on all the
examples in the minibatch, and different activations being produced between
training and inference. We propose Batch Renormalization, a simple and
effective extension to ensure that the training and inference models generate
the same outputs that depend on individual examples rather than the entire

better than batchnorm when training with small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. At

quantum system identification. In quantum technologies, the dimension of a
quantum system (or its corresponding accessible Hilbert space) is an important
resource, as larger dimensions determine e.g. the performance of quantum
computation protocols or the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Despite being a
critical task in quantum system identification, estimating the Hilbert space
dimension is experimentally challenging. While there have been proposals for
various dimension witnesses capable of putting a lower bound on the dimension
from measuring collective observables that encode correlations, in many
practical scenarios, especially for multiqubit systems, the experimental
control might not be able to engineer the required initialization, dynamics and
observables.
  Here we propose a more practical strategy, that relies not on directly
measuring an unknown multiqubit target system, but on the indirect interaction
with a local quantum probe under the experimenter's control. Assuming only that
the interaction model is given and the evolution correlates all the qubits with
the probe, we combine a graph-theoretical approach and realization theory to
demonstrate that the dimension of the Hilbert space can be exactly estimated
from the model order of the system. We further analyze the robustness in the
presence of background noise of the proposed estimation method based on
realization theory, finding that despite stringent constrains on the allowed
noise level, exact dimension estimation can still be achieved.

light both during inflation and in the true vacuum. After inflation, most of
the ALPs decay and evaporate into plasma through a coupling to photons, and the
remaining ones become dark matter. We find that the observed CMB and matter
power spectrum as well as the dark matter abundance point to an ALP of mass
$m_\phi = {\cal O}(0.01)$ eV and the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi \gamma
\gamma} ={\cal O}(10^{-11})$GeV$^{-1}$: the ALP miracle. The suggested
parameter region is within the reach of the next generation axion helioscope,
IAXO. Furthermore, thermalized ALPs contribute to hot dark matter and its
abundance is given in terms of the effective number of extra neutrino species,
$\Delta N_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.03$, which can be tested by the future CMB
experiments. We also discuss a case with multiple ALPs, where the coupling to
photons can be enhanced in the early Universe by an order of magnitude or more,
which enlarges the parameter space for the ALP miracle. The heavy ALP plays a
role of the waterfall field in hybrid inflation, and reheats the Universe, and
it can be searched for in various experiments such as SHiP.

mixing temporal and spatial modalities could require computing a large number
of trajectories, with costly numerical solution of differential equations; and
might still fail to check intermediate values between discrete points on those

Material accreted onto the compact object may form a disk and power a jet. We
study analytically and through numerical simulations the interaction between
the jet and the CE. We determine the conditions under which accreting material
quenches the jet or allows it to propagate successfully, in which case even the
envelope may be ejected. Close to the stellar core of the companion the compact
object accretes at a larger rate. A jet launched from this region needs a
larger accretion-to-ejection efficiency to successfully propagate through the
CE compared to a jet launched far from the stellar core, and is strongly
deflected by the orbital motion. The energy deposited by the jet may be larger
than the binding energy of the envelope. The jet can, thus, play a fundamental
role in the CE evolution. We find that the energy dissipation of the jet into
the CE may stop accretion onto the disk. We expect the jet to be intermittent,
unless the energy deposited is large enough to lead to the unbinding of the
outer layers of the CE. Given that the energy and duration of the jet are
similar to those of ultra-long GRBs, we suggest this as a new channel to
produce these events.

the successive data releases, and we present its application to the G-band
photometry results of the first 14 months of Gaia operations that comprises 28
days of Ecliptic Pole Scanning Law and 13 months of Nominal Scanning Law.
  Out of the 694 million, all-sky, sources that have calibrated G-band
photometry in this first stage of the mission, about 2.3 million sources that
have at least 20 observations are located within 38 degrees from the South
Ecliptic Pole. We detect about 14% of them as variable candidates, among which
the automated classification identified 9347 Cepheid and RR Lyrae candidates.
Additional visual inspections and selection criteria led to the publication of
3194 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, described in Clementini et al. (2016). Under
the restrictive conditions for DR1, the completenesses of Cepheids and RR Lyrae
stars are estimated at 67% and 58%, respectively, numbers that will
significantly increase with subsequent Gaia data releases.
  Data processing within the Gaia Consortium is iterative, the quality of the

this article show a glimpse of the exceptional harvest that is to be expected

asymptotically flat spacetimes that become nonradiative infinitely far in the
past and future. Between these early and late times, the magnetic-parity part
of the time integral of the gravitational-wave strain can undergo a nonzero
change; this difference is the spin memory effect. Families of freely falling
observers around an isolated source can measure this effect, in principle, and
fluxes of angular momentum per unit solid angle (or changes in superspin
charges) generate the effect. The spin memory effect had not been computed
explicitly for astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as compact
binaries. In this paper, we compute the spin memory in terms of a set of
radiative multipole moments of the gravitational-wave strain. The result of
this calculation allows us to establish the following results about the spin
memory: (i) We find that the accumulation of the spin memory behaves in a
qualitatively different way from that of the displacement memory effect for
nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the post-Newtonian
approximation: the spin memory undergoes a large secular growth over the
duration of the inspiral, whereas for the displacement effect this increase is
small. (ii) The rate at which the spin memory grows is equivalent to a
nonlinear, but nonoscillatory and nonhereditary effect in the gravitational
waveform that had been previously calculated for nonspinning, quasicircular
compact binaries. (iii) This rate of build-up of the spin memory could
potentially be detected by future gravitational-wave detectors by carefully
combining the measured waveforms from hundreds of gravitational-wave detections
of compact binaries.

minimize the aggregate deviation between zone temperatures and their set
points, as well as the building energy consumption, subject to practical
operating constraints, by adjusting zone flow rates. Because this problem is
nonconvex, we propose two methods to (approximately) solve it and to design the
real-time control. In the first method, we present a convex relaxation approach
to solve an approximate version of the steady-state optimization problem, where
the heat transfer between neighboring zones is ignored. We prove the tightness
of the relaxation and develop a real-time decentralized algorithm to regulate
the zone flow rate. In the second method, we introduce a mild assumption under
which the original optimization problem becomes convex, and then a real-time
distributed algorithm is developed to regulate the zone flow rate. In both
cases, the thermal dynamics can be driven to equilibria which are optimal
solutions to those associated steady-state optimization problems. Finally,
numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed
control schemes.

clustering of a sample of bright (-22.7<M_UV<-21.125) LBGs at z~6 and use a
halo occupation distribution (HOD) model to measure their typical halo masses.
We find that the clustering amplitude and corresponding HOD fits suggests that
these sources are highly biased (b~8) objects in the densest regions of the
high-redshift Universe. Coupled with the observed rapid evolution of the number
density of these objects, our results suggest that the shape of high luminosity
end of the luminosity function is related to feedback processes or dust
obscuration in the early Universe - as opposed to a scenario where these
sources are predominantly rare instances of the much more numerous M_UV ~ -19
population of galaxies caught in a particularly vigorous period of star
formation. There is a slight tension between the number densities and
clustering measurements, which we interpret this as a signal that a refinement
of the model halo bias relation at high redshifts or the incorporation of
quasi-linear effects may be needed for future attempts at modelling the
clustering and number counts. Finally, the difference in number density between

one-dimensional Ly$\alpha$-forest power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) and from
the VLT/XSHOOTER legacy survey (XQ-100). In this paper, we present our own
measurement of the power spectrum with the publicly released XQ-100 quasar
spectra.
  Fitting Ly$\alpha$ data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellent
agreement with the values derived independently from Planck 2015 Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) data. Combining BOSS and XQ-100 Ly$\alpha$ power
spectra, we constrain the sum of neutrino masses to $\sum m_\nu < 0.8$ eV (95\%
C.L). With the addition of CMB data, this bound is tightened to $\sum m_\nu <
0.14$ eV (95\% C.L.).
  With their sensitivity to small scales, Ly$\alpha$ data are ideal to
constrain $\Lambda$WDM models. Using XQ-100 alone, we issue lower bounds on
pure dark matter particles: $m_X \gtrsim 2.08 \: \rm{keV}$ (95\% C.L.) for
early decoupled thermal relics, and $m_s \gtrsim 10.2 \: \rm{keV}$ (95\% C.L.)
for non-resonantly produced right-handed neutrinos. Combining the 1D Ly$\alpha$
forest power spectrum measured by BOSS and XQ-100, we improve the two bounds to
$m_X \gtrsim 4.17 \: \rm{keV}$ and $m_s \gtrsim 25.0 \: \rm{keV}$ (95\% C.L.).
The $3~\sigma$ bound shows a more significant improvement, increasing from $m_X
\gtrsim 2.74 \: \rm{keV}$ for BOSS alone to $m_X \gtrsim 3.10 \: \rm{keV}$ for
the combined BOSS+XQ-100 data set.
  Finally, we include in our analysis the first two redshift bins ($z=4.2$ and
$z=4.6$) of the power spectrum measured with the high-resolution HIRES/MIKE
spectrographs. The addition of HIRES/MIKE power spectrum allows us to further

water to exist continuously over geologic timescales. Water in each of its
thermodynamic phases interacts with solar and thermal radiation and is the
cause for strong climatic feedbacks. Thus, assessments of the habitable zone
require models to include a complete treatment of the hydrological cycle over
geologic time. Here, we use the Community Atmosphere Model from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research to study the evolution of climate for an
Earth-like planet at constant CO2, under a wide range of stellar fluxes from
F-, G-, and K-dwarf main sequence stars. Around each star we find four stable
climate states defined by mutually exclusive global mean surface temperatures
(Ts); snowball (Ts < 235 K), waterbelt (235 K < Ts < 250 K), temperate (275 K <
Ts < 315 K), and moist greenhouse (Ts > 330 K). Each is separated by abrupt
climatic transitions. Waterbelt, temperate, and cooler moist greenhouse
climates can maintain open-ocean against both sea-ice albedo and hydrogen
escape processes respectively, and thus constitute habitable worlds. We
consider the warmest possible habitable planet as having Ts ~ 355 K, at which
point diffusion limited water-loss could remove an Earth ocean in ~1 Gyr.
Without long timescale regulation of non-condensable greenhouse species at
Earth-like temperatures and pressures, such as CO2, habitability can be
maintained for an upper limit of ~2.2, ~2.4 and ~4.7 Gyr around F-, G- and
K-dwarf stars respectively due to main sequence brightening.

interspecies encounter rate which is driven by their behaviour and is strongly
influenced by turbulence of the surrounding environment. A distinctive feature
of copepods motility is their ability to perform quick displacements, often
dubbed jumps, by means of powerful swimming strokes. Such a reaction has been
associated to an escape behaviour from flow disturbances due to predators or
other external dangers. In the present study, the encounter rate of copepods in
a developed turbulent flow with intensity comparable to the one found in
copepods' habitat is numerically investigated. This is done by means of a
Lagrangian copepod (LC) model that mimics the jump escape reaction behaviour
from localised high-shear rate fluctuations in the turbulent flows. Our
analysis shows that the encounter rate for copepods of typical perception
radius of ~ {\eta}, where {\eta} is the dissipative scale of turbulence, can be
increased by a factor up to ~ 100 compared to the one experienced by passively
transported fluid tracers. Furthermore, we address the effect of introducing in
the LC model a minimal waiting time between consecutive jumps. It is shown that
any encounter-rate enhancement is lost if such time goes beyond the dissipative
time-scale of turbulence, {\tau}_{\eta}. Because typically in the ocean {\eta}
~ 0.001m and {\tau}_{\eta} ~ 1s, this provides stringent constraints on the
turbulent-driven enhancement of encounter-rate due to a purely mechanical

the unified theory of electric pressure broadening of the hydrogen lines into
the non-LTE radiative transfer code RH. This broadening prescription produces a
much more realistic spectrum of the quiescent, A0 star Vega compared to the
analytic approximations used as a damping parameter in the Voigt profiles. We
test recent radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of the atmospheric
response to high nonthermal electron beam fluxes with the new broadening
prescription and find that the Balmer lines are over-broadened at the densest

revisit the three-component phenomenological flare model of the YZ CMi

resolved measurements of the coma distributions of HNC, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO and

period UT 10:10-11:00 on Nov. 16, the comet displayed a remarkable drop in
activity, manifested as a $>42$% decline in the molecular line and continuum
fluxes. The H$_2$CO observations are consistent with an abrupt, $\approx50$%
reduction in the cometary gas production rate soon after the start of our
observations. On Nov. 17, the total observed fluxes remained relatively
constant during a similar period, but strong variations in the morphology of
the HNC distribution were detected as a function of time, indicative of a
clumpy, intermittent outflow for this species. Our observations suggest that at
least part of the detected HNC originated from degradation of nitrogen-rich
organic refractory material, released intermittently from confined regions of
the nucleus. By contrast, the distributions of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO during the
Nov. 17 observations were relatively uniform, consistent with isotropic outflow
and stable activity levels for these species. These results highlight a large
degree of variability in the production of gas and dust from comet ISON during
its pre-perihelion outburst, consistent with repeated disruption of the nucleus
interspersed with periods of relative quiescence.

mass---the MZ relation---as a function of the large scale galaxy environment
parameterized by the local density. The dependence of the MZ relation on the
environment is small. The metallicity where the MZ relation saturates and the
slope of the MZ relation are both independent of the local density. The impact
of the large scale environment is completely parameterized by the
anti-correlation between local density and the turnover stellar mass where the
MZ relation begins to saturate. Analytical modeling suggests that the
anti-correlation between the local density and turnover stellar mass is a
consequence of a variation in the gas content of star-forming galaxies. Across
$\sim1$ order of magnitude in local density, the gas content at a fixed stellar
mass varies by $\sim5\%$. Variation of the specific star formation rate with
environment is consistent with this interpretation. At a fixed stellar mass,
galaxies in low density environments have lower metallicities because they are
slightly more gas-rich than galaxies in high density environments. Modeling the
shape of the mass-metallicity relation thus provides an indirect means to probe
subtle variations in the gas content of star-forming galaxies.

algal chlorophyll may be comparable during Boreal Spring to the corresponding
values attributable to BC. The largest chlorophyll attenuation is obtained in
the bottom layer, which supports pigment concentrations of about 300 to 1000

for the ice interior in regions north of 75{\deg} N and across the Canadian
Archipelago are less than 0.1 micro g/m3. Freeboard and infiltration
communities lead to intermediate levels of light removal. Since BC works its
way downward from the atmospheric interface, there will be regions where it
appropriates photosynthetic capability. Where ice thicknesses permit
significant penetration through the pack column the ice algae may be crucial
absorbers. We propose a continuous increase in relative chlorophyll activity

\hcop, HCN, and HNC toward the extragalactic continuum source B1741-312 at
l=-2.14\degr, b=-1.00\degr\ with existing CO, H I, and dust emission and
absorption measurements. We placed the atomic and molecular gas in the bulge
and disk using circular and non-circular galactic kinematics, deriving N(H I)
from a combination of 21cm emission and absorption and we derive N(\HH) from
scaling of the \hcop\ absorption. We then inverted the variation of near-IR
reddening E(J-K) with distance modulus and scale E(J-K) to a total gas column
density N(H) that may be compared to N(H I) and N(\HH). Results. At
galactocentric radii \Rgal\ $>$ 1.5 kpc, conventional measures such as the
standard CO-\HH\ conversion factor and locally observed N(\hcop)/N(\HH) ratio
separately imply that H I and \HH\ contribute about equally to N(H), and the
gas-derived N(H) values are in broad agreement with those derived from E(J-K).
Within the Galactic bulge at \Rgal $<$ 1.5 kpc, H I contributes less than 10\%
of the material inferred from E(J-K), so that the molecular absorption detected

$\Delta m^2_{\alpha \alpha}$ ($\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$), in regions of neutrino

we investigate the question of whether the similar effective two-flavor

perturbative framework with the expansion parameters $\epsilon$ and $s_{13}

the resultant two-flavor form of the probability is valid to order $\epsilon$.
However, we observe a contrived feature of the effective $\Delta m^2_{\alpha

parameters and has energy dependence, which may be legitimate because it comes
from the matter potential. But, it turned out that $\Delta m^2_{\mu \mu} (a)$
becomes $L$-dependent, though $\Delta m^2_{ee} (a)$ is not, which casts doubt
on adequacy of the concept of effective $\Delta m^2$ in matter. We also find
that the appearance probability in vacuum admits, to order $\epsilon$, the
similar effective two-flavor form with a slightly different effective $\Delta
m^2_{\beta \alpha}$ from the disappearance channel. A general result is derived
to describe suppression of the matter effect in the oscillation probability.

These phenomena are governed by the compressible Euler equation, which is one
of crucial equations in inhomogeneous conservation laws.
  In this paper, we consider its unsteady flow and devote to proving the global
existence and stability of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the general
nozzle. The theorem has been proved in (Tsuge in Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.

the present paper is to remove this restriction, that is, we consider large
data. Although the subject is important in Mathematics, Physics and
engineering, it remained open for a long time. The problem seems to lie in a
bounded estimate of approximate solutions, because we have only method to
investigate the behavior with respect to the time variable. To solve this, we
first introduce a generalized invariant region. Compared with the existing
ones, its upper and lower bounds are extended constants to functions of the
space variable. However, we cannot apply the new invariant region to the
traditional difference method. Therefore, we invent the modified Godunov
scheme. The approximate solutions consist of some functions corresponding to
the upper and lower bounds of the invariant regions. These methods enable us to
investigate the behavior of approximate solutions with respect to the space
variable. The ideas are also applicable to other nonlinear problems involving
similar difficulties.

measurement, performed on an underdoped Hg1201 sample in magnetic fields along
the crystallographic $c$ axis of up to 16 T, provides information about the
form factor of the CDW order. As expected from the single-CuO$_2$-layer
structure of Hg1201, the CDW correlations vanish at half-integer values of $L$
and appear to be peaked at integer $L$. We conclude that the atomic
displacements associated with the short-range CDW order are mainly planar,
within the CuO$_2$ layers.

enabling closest target range estimation. In addition, we propose an
alternative to vehicular forward collision detection by extending IEEE 802.11

providing a foundation for joint communications and radar framework.
Furthermore, we perform an experimental demonstration using existing IEEE

frequency-domain channel estimates. The results of this paper show that our
solution delivers similar accuracy and reliability to mmWave radar devices with

simple cubic lattice through a Hartree-Fock approximation, within a

For a fixed electronic density, $n_c$, the small $J$ region of the ground state

finite temperatures, and in the region of coexistence, thermal fluctuations
suppress the different ordered phases in succession: the SAFM phase at lower

an expected error of $O(n^{-1/2-1/(4d-2)+\epsilon})$ for arbitrarily small

boundaries are parallel to coordinate axes. The results can be used to assess

surface tension distribution underlying the propulsion mechanism of the
droplet, is generated by a non-uniform distribution of surfactant on its
surface. We provide a numerical treatment for the main factors playing a role
in real systems, such as advection, diffusion and the presence of chemical
species with different behaviors. The flow field inside and outside the droplet
is derived, thus accounting for the two-way coupling between the surrounding
fluid and the motion of the swimmer. Mass diffusion is also taken into account.
In particular, we consider two concentration fields: the surfactant
concentration in the bulk, i.e. in the liquid surrounding the droplet, and the
surfactant concentration on the surface. The latter is related to the local
surface tension, through an equation of state (Langmuir equation). We examine
different interaction mechanisms between the bulk and the surface concentration
fields, namely the case of insoluble surfactants attached to the surface (no
exchange between the bulk and the surface) and soluble surfactants with
adsorption/desorption at the surface. We also consider the case where the bulk
concentration field is in equilibrium with the content of the droplet. The
numerical results are validated through comparison with analytical
calculations. We show that our model can reproduce the typical pusher/puller
behavior presented by squirmers. It is also able to capture the self-propulsion
mechanism of droplets driven by Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions, as well as
a typical chemotactic behavior.

programming languages are greatly simplified by employing a higher-order
representation of syntax known as Higher-Order Abstract Syntax or HOAS. The
underlying idea of HOAS is to use a meta-language that provides a built-in and
logical treatment of binding related notions. By embedding the meta-language
within a larger programming or reasoning framework, it is possible to absorb
the treatment of binding structure in the object language into the meta-theory
of the system, thereby greatly simplifying the overall implementation and
reasoning processes.
  We develop the above argument in this thesis by presenting and demonstrating
the effectiveness of an approach to the verified implementation of compiler
transformations for functional programs that exploits HOAS. In this approach,
transformations on functional programs are first articulated in the form of
rule-based relational specifications. These specifications are rendered into
programs in the language lambda Prolog. On the one hand, these programs serve
directly as implementations. On the other hand, they can be used as input to
the Abella system which allows us to prove properties about them and thereby
about the implementations. Both lambda Prolog and Abella support the use of the
HOAS approach. Thus, they constitute a framework that can be used to test out
the benefits of the HOAS approach in verified compilation. We use them to
implement and verify a compiler for a representative functional programming
language that embodies the transformations that form the core of many compilers
for such languages. In both the programming and the reasoning phases, we show
how the use of the HOAS approach significantly simplifies the representation,
manipulation, analysis and reasoning of binding structure.

non-thermal emissions from rotation-powered pulsars in optical and X-ray bands.
In this paper, we study the synchrotron radiation emitted by the created
electron and positron pairs in the pulsar magnetosphere to constrain on the
energy conversion efficiency from the Poynting flux to the particle energy
flux. We model two pair creation processes, two-photon collision which
efficiently works in young $\gamma$-ray pulsars ($\lesssim10^6$ yr), and
magnetic pair creation which is the dominant process to supply pairs in old
pulsars ($\gtrsim10^6$ yr). Using the analytical model, we derive the maximum
synchrotron luminosity as a function of the energy conversion efficiency. From
the comparison with observations, we find that the energy conversion efficiency
to the accelerated particles should be an order of unity in the magnetosphere,
even though we make a number of the optimistic assumptions to enlarge the
synchrotron luminosity. In order to explain the luminosity of the non-thermal
X-ray/optical emission from pulsars with low spin-down luminosity $L_{\rm
sd}\lesssim10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, non-dipole magnetic field components should
be dominant at the emission region. For the $\gamma$-ray pulsars with $L_{\rm

flux ratios are much higher than the flux ratio between curvature and the
synchrotron radiations. We discuss some possibilities such as the coexistence
of multiple accelerators in the magnetosphere as suggested from the recent

sparse with most entries equal to zero, several decentralized sparse adaptive
algorithms have been proposed recently. Most of them is focused on the single
task estimation problems, in which all nodes receive data associated with the
same unknown vector and collaborate to estimate it. However, many applications
are inherently multitask oriented and each node has its own unknown vector
different from others'. The related multitask estimation problem benefits from
collaborations among the nodes as neighbor nodes usually share analogous
properties and thus similar unknown vectors. In this work, we study the
distributed sparse multitask recursive least squares (RLS) problem over
networks. We first propose a decentralized online alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for the formulated RLS problem. The algorithm
is simplified for easy implementation with closed-form computations in each
iteration and low storage requirements. Moreover, to further reduce the
complexity, we present a decentralized online subgradient method with low
computational overhead. We theoretically analyze the convergence behavior of
the proposed subgradient method and derive an error bound related to the
network topology and algorithm parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms is corroborated by numerical simulations and an accuracy-complexity
tradeoff between the proposed two algorithms is highlighted.

every node has a local decision vector to determine. Each node incurs a cost
depending on its decision vector and each link also incurs a cost depending on
the decision vectors of its two end nodes. All nodes cooperate to minimize the
overall network cost. The formulated network cost minimization problem has
broad applications in distributed signal processing and control over
multi-agent systems. To obtain a decentralized algorithm for the formulated
problem, we resort to the distributed alternating direction method of
multipliers (DADMM). However, each iteration of the DADMM involves solving a
local optimization problem at each node, leading to intractable computational
burden in many circumstances. As such, we propose a distributed linearized ADMM
(DLADMM) algorithm for network cost minimization. In the DLADMM, each iteration
only involves closed-form computations and avoids local optimization problems,
which greatly reduces the computational complexity compared to the DADMM. We
prove that the DLADMM converges to an optimal point when the local cost
functions are convex and have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Linear
convergence rate of the DLADMM is also established if the local cost functions
are further strongly convex. Numerical experiments are conducted to corroborate
the effectiveness of the DLADMM and we observe that the DLADMM has similar
convergence performance as DADMM does while the former enjoys much lower
computational overhead. The impact of network topology, connectivity and
algorithm parameters are also investigated through simulations.

stands out to be a key design challenge for mmWave networks deployed in urban
regions due to the blockage effect characterizing mmWave propagation.
Specifically, mmWave signals can be blocked by buildings and other large urban
objects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the blockage effect on the
connectivity of mmWave networks in a Manhattan-type urban region modeled using
a random regular lattice while base stations (BSs) are Poisson distributed in
the plane. In particular, we analyze the connectivity probability that a
typical user is within the transmission range of a BS and connected by a
line-of-sight. Using random lattice and stochastic geometry theories, different
lower bounds on the connectivity probability are derived as functions of the
buildings' size and probability of a lattice cell being occupied by a building
as well as BS density and transmission range. The asymptotic connectivity
probability is also derived for cases of dense buildings. Last, the results are
extended to heterogeneous networks. Our study yields closed-form relations
between the parameters of the building process and the BS process, providing
useful guidelines for practical mmWave network deployment.

here we perform first-principles calculations to evaluate the possible
superconductivity in a 2D monolayer Mo$_2$C. Three candidate structures
(monolayer alpha-Mo$_2$C, 1T MXene-Mo$_2$C, and 2H MXene-Mo$_2$C) are
considered and the most stable form is found to be the 2H MXene-Mo$_2$C.
Electronic structure calculations indicate that both unpassivated and
passivated 2H forms exhibit metallic properties. We obtain the phonon
frequencies and electron-phonon couplings using density-functional perturbation
theory, and based on the BCS theory and McMillan equation, estimate the
critical temperatures to be in the ~0-13 K range, depending on the species of
the surface termination (O, H and OH). The most interesting termination group
is H, which can increase the electron-phonon coupling and bring the critical
temperature to 13 K. This shows a rather high critical temperature, tunable by
surface termination, making this 2D carbide an interesting test bed for
low-dimensional superconductivity.

and those without when arranged by insolation ($I$) and escape velocity
($v_{\mathrm{esc}}$). The dividing line goes as $I \propto v_{\mathrm{esc}}^4$.
Exoplanets with reported masses and radii are shown to crowd against the
extrapolation of the Solar System trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline
that unites all the planets. The $I \propto v_{\mathrm{esc}}^4$ relation may
implicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of
hydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly-irradiated
Extrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test
because copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence
requires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences ($I_{\mathrm{xuv}}$) using
proxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as
$I_{\mathrm{xuv}} \propto v_{\mathrm{esc}}^3\sqrt{\rho}$, which differs
distinctly from the apparent $I_{\mathrm{xuv}} \propto v_{\mathrm{esc}}^4$
relation. Energy-limited escape does provide good quantitative agreement to the
highly irradiated EGPs. Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can
lose more than 1% of its mass as H$_2$. Impact erosion, to the extent that
impact velocities $v_{\mathrm{imp}}$ can be estimated for exoplanets, fits to a
$v_{\mathrm{imp}} \approx 4\,-\,5\, v_{\mathrm{esc}}$ shoreline. The
proportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in deep
atmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is on the

compass that refers to its selectivity around the geomagnetic field strength.
We show that the radical-pair model, using biologically feasible hyperfine
parameters, can qualitatively explain the salient features of the avian compass
as observed from behavioral experiments: its functional window, as well as
disruption of the compass action by an RF field of specific frequencies.
Further, we show that adjustment of the hyperfine parameters can tune the
functional window, suggesting a possible mechanism for its observed
adaptability to field variation. While these lend strong support to the
radical-pair model, we find it impossible to explain quantitatively the
observed width of the functional window within this model, or even with simple
augmentations thereto. This suggests that a deeper generalization of this model
may be called for; we conjecture that environmental coupling may be playing a
subtle role here that has not been captured accurately. Lastly, we examine a
possible biological purpose to the functional window; assuming evolutionary
benefit from radical-pair magnetoreception, we conjecture that the functional
window is simply a corollary thereof and brings no additional advantage.

  K-Dominant Skylines","Appeared as a short paper in ICDE 2017",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Skyline queries enable multi-criteria optimization by filtering objects that
are worse in all the attributes of interest than another object. To handle the
large answer set of skyline queries in high-dimensional datasets, the concept
of k-dominance was proposed where an object is said to dominate another object
if it is better (or equal) in at least k attributes. This relaxes the full
domination criterion of normal skyline queries and, therefore, produces lesser
number of skyline objects. This is called the k-dominant skyline set. Many
practical applications, however, require that the preferences are applied on a
joined relation. Common examples include flights having one or multiple stops,
a combination of product price and shipping costs, etc. In this paper, we
extend the k-dominant skyline queries to the join paradigm by enabling such
queries to be asked on joined relations. We call such queries KSJQ (k-dominant
skyline join queries). The number of skyline attributes, k, that an object must
dominate is from the combined set of skyline attributes of the joined relation.
We show how pre-processing the base relations helps in reducing the time of
answering such queries over the naive method of joining the relations first and
then running the k-dominant skyline computation. We also extend the query to
handle cases where the skyline preference is on aggregated values in the joined
relation (such as total cost of the multiple legs of the flight) which are
available only after the join is performed. In addition to these problems, we
devise efficient algorithms to choose the value of k based on the desired
cardinality of the final skyline set. Experiments on both real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and practicality of our
algorithms.

neutron star: supersonic (Bondi) accretion, which takes place when the captured
matter cools down rapidly and falls supersonically towards the neutron-star
magnetosphere, and subsonic (settling) accretion which occurs when the plasma
remains hot until it meets the magnetospheric boundary. In subsonic accretion,
which works at X-ray luminosities $\lesssim 4\times 10^{36}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, a
hot quasi-spherical shell must form around the magnetosphere, and the actual
accretion rate onto the neutron star is determined by the ability of the plasma
to enter the magnetosphere due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We show how
the dimensionless parameters of the theory can be determined from observations
of equilibrium X-ray pulsars (Vela X-1, GX 301-2). We also discuss how in the
settling accretion theory bright X-ray flares ($\sim 10^{38}-10^{40}$~ergs)
observed in supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXT) may be produced by sporadic
capture of magnetized stellar-wind plasma. At sufficiently low accretion rates,
magnetic reconnection can enhance the magnetospheric plasma entry rate,
resulting in copious production of X-ray photons, strong Compton cooling and
ultimately in unstable accretion of the entire shell. A bright flare develops
on the free-fall time scale in the shell, and the typical energy released in an
SFXT bright flare corresponds to the mass of the shell.

point contacts with in-plane side gates has been attributed to the onset of
spin-polarized current through these structures. For InAs quantum point
contacts with the same width but longer channel length, there is roughly a
fourfold increase in the range of common sweep voltage applied to the side
gates over which the 0.5 conductance plateau is observed when the QPC aspect
ratio (ratio of length over width of the narrow portion of the structure) is
increased by a factor 3. Non-equilibrium Green s function simulations indicate
that the increase in the size of the 0.5 conductance plateau is due to an
increased importance, over a larger range of common sweep voltage, of the
effects of electron-electron interactions in QPC devices with larger aspect
ratio. The use of asymmetrically biased QPCs with in-plane side gates and large
aspect ratio could therefore pave the way to build robust spin injectors and
detectors for the successful implementation of spin field effect transistors

indistinguishable, can move at most a constant distance in each step, cannot

the other side, in the case of the 2-dimensional grid, the only known gathering

  the Absence of Ground Truth","Accepted article to appear in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
  2017",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When integrating computational tools such as automatic segmentation into
clinical practice, it is of utmost importance to be able to assess the level of
accuracy on new data, and in particular, to detect when an automatic method
fails. However, this is difficult to achieve due to absence of ground truth.
Segmentation accuracy on clinical data might be different from what is found
through cross-validation because validation data is often used during
incremental method development, which can lead to overfitting and unrealistic
performance expectations. Before deployment, performance is quantified using
different metrics, for which the predicted segmentation is compared to a
reference segmentation, often obtained manually by an expert. But little is
known about the real performance after deployment when a reference is
unavailable. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reverse classification
accuracy (RCA) as a framework for predicting the performance of a segmentation
method on new data. In RCA we take the predicted segmentation from a new image
to train a reverse classifier which is evaluated on a set of reference images
with available ground truth. The hypothesis is that if the predicted
segmentation is of good quality, then the reverse classifier will perform well
on at least some of the reference images. We validate our approach on
multi-organ segmentation with different classifiers and segmentation methods.
Our results indicate that it is indeed possible to predict the quality of
individual segmentations, in the absence of ground truth. Thus, RCA is ideal
for integration into automatic processing pipelines in clinical routine and as
part of large-scale image analysis studies.

wide attentions over the last two decades. Multispectral imaging possesses
spatial and spectral resolving abilities, is very useful for surveying scenes

utilize narrow band filters or dispersive optical devices to separate lights of
different wavelengths, and then use multiple bucket detectors or an array
detector to record them separately. Here, we propose a novel multispectral
ghost imaging method that uses one single bucket detector with multiplexed
illumination to produce colored image. The multiplexed illumination patterns
are produced by three binary encoded matrices (corresponding to red, green,
blue colored information, respectively) and random patterns. The results of
simulation and experiment have verified that our method can be effective to
recover the colored object. Our method has two major advantages: one is that
the binary encoded matrices as cipher keys can protect the security of private
contents; the other is that multispectral images are produced simultaneously by
one single-pixel detector, which significantly reduces the amount of the data
acquisition.

over total energy dissipation is taken as an objective functional, and by using
a variational method the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived, which are solved
numerically to obtain the optimal states in the sense of maximisation of the
functional. At high Reynolds numbers, the optimal heat transfer is found in
three-dimensional velocity field in which hierarchical self-similar
quasi-streamwise vortical structures appear. The streamwise vortices are tilted
in the spanwise direction so that they may produce the anticyclonic vorticity
antiparallel to the mean-shear vorticity, bringing about significant
three-dimensionality. The isotherms wrapped around the tilted anticyclonic
vortices undergo the cross-axial shear of the mean flow, so that the spacing of
the wrapped isotherms is narrower and so the temperature gradient is steeper
than those around a purely streamwise (two-dimensional) vortex tube,
intensifying scalar dissipation and so a wall heat flux. Moreover, the tilted
anticyclonic vortices induce the flow towards the wall to push low- (or high-)
temperature fluids on the hot (or cold) wall, enhancing a wall heat flux. The
optimised three-dimensional velocity fields achieve a much higher wall heat
flux and much lower energy dissipation than those of plane Couette turbulence.

(ICVs) based on noisy high-frequency data has emerged as a challenging problem.
In the literature, a pre-averaging estimator (PA-RCov) is proposed to deal with
the microstructure noise. Using the large-dimensional random matrix theory, it
has been established that the eigenvalue distribution of the PA-RCov matrix is
intimately linked to that of the ICV through the Marcenko-Pastur equation.
Consequently, the spectrum of the ICV can be inferred from that of the PA-RCov.
However, extensive data analyses demonstrate that the spectrum of the PA-RCov
is spiked, that is, a few large eigenvalues (spikes) stay away from the others
which form a rather continuous distribution with a density function (bulk).
Therefore, any inference on the ICVs must take into account this spiked
structure. As a methodological contribution, we propose a spiked model for the
ICVs where spikes can be inferred from those of the available PA-RCov matrices.
The consistency of the inference procedure is established and is checked by
extensive simulation studies. In addition, we apply our method to the real data
from the US and Hong Kong markets. It is found that our model clearly
outperforms the existing one in predicting the existence of spikes and in
mimicking the empirical PA-RCov matrices.

massive neutrinos with all known conserved symmetries duly gauged. The work
presented here is based on the argument that the see-saw mechanism does not
force the new right handed symmetry scale to be very high, and as such some of
the species from the spectrum of the new gauge and Higgs bosons can have masses
within a few orders of magnitude of the TeV scale. The scale of the left-right
parity breaking in turn can be sequestered from the Planck scale by
supersymmetry. We have studied several formulations of such Just Beyond

Specifically the need to eliminate phenomenologically undesirable domain walls
gives many useful clues. The possibility that the exact left-right symmetry
breaks in conjunction with supersymmetry has been explored in the context of
gauge mediation, placing restrictions on the available parameter space. Finally
we have also studied a left-right symmetric model in the context of metastable
supersymmetric vacua and obtained constraints on the mass scale of Right handed
symmetry. In all the cases studied, The mass scale of right handed neutrino
$M_R$ remains bounded from above, and in some of the cases the scale $10^9$ GeV
favourable for supersymmetric thermal leptogenesis is disallowed. On the other
hand PeV scale remains a viable option, and the results warrant a more detailed
study of such models for their observability in collider and astroparticle
experiments.

  in Physics Letters B",,"10.1016/j.physletb.2017.05.006",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the sensitivity of top-Higgs coupling by considering the
associated vertex as CP phase ($\zeta_t$) dependent through the process $p\,
e^- \to \bar t \,h \,\nu_e$ in the future Large Hadron electron collider. In
particular the decay modes are taken to be $h \to b\bar b$ and $\bar t \to$
leptonic mode. Several distinct $\zeta_t$ dependent features are demonstrated
by considering observables like cross sections, top-quark polarisation,
rapidity difference between $h$ and $\bar t$ and different angular asymmetries.
Luminosity ($L$) dependent exclusion limits are obtained for $\zeta_t$ by
considering significance based on fiducial cross sections at different
$\sigma$-levels. For electron and proton beam-energies of 60 GeV and 7 TeV
respectively, at $L = 100$~fb$^{-1}$, the regions above $\pi/5 < \zeta_t \leq
\pi$ are excluded at 2$\sigma$ confidence level, which reflects better
sensitivity expected at the Large Hadron Collider. With appropriate error
fitting methodology we find that the accuracy of SM top-Higgs coupling could be
measured to be $\kappa = 1.00 \pm 0.17 (0.08)$ at $\sqrt{s} = 1.3 (1.8)$ TeV
for an ultimate $L = 1 \,\rm{ab}^{-1}$.

require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose to model the
statistical relationships of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using
two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our
architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised
manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given
point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose and a
corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning
a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth
maps. To improve generalization and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, we
jointly train a generator and a discriminator. At each iteration, the generator
is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to
synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the
discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized and
unlabeled samples. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly
efficient and runs at 90 FPS on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better
than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.

be invested in different advertising channels over time with the objective of
influencing social opinions in a network of individuals. In our analysis, we
consider both exogenous influence mechanisms, such as advertising campaigns, as
well as endogenous mechanisms of social influence, such as word-of-mouth and
peer-pressure, which are modeled using diffusion dynamics.
  We show that for a broad family of objective functions, the optimal influence
strategy at every time uses all channels at either their maximum rate or not at
all, i.e., a bang-bang strategy. Furthermore, we prove that the number of
switches between these extremes is bounded above by a term that is typically
much smaller than the number of agents. This means that the optimal influence
strategy is to exert maximum effort in waves for every channel, and then cease
effort and let the effects propagate. We also show that, at the beginning of
the campaign, the total cost-adjusted reach of an exogenous advertising channel
determines its relative value. In contrast, as we approach our investment
horizon (e.g., election day), the optimal strategy is to invest in channels
able to target individuals instead of broad-reaching channels. We demonstrate
that the optimal influence strategies are easily computable in several
practical cases, and explicitly characterize the optimal controls for the case
of linear objective functions in closed form. Finally, we see that, in the
canonical example of designing an election campaign, identifying late-deciders
is a critical component in the optimal design.

generalize this for any inertial frame and to explain why an absolute speed can
be assigned to any inertial frame we introduced the triplets paradox.

  Systems: A Network Interdiction Game","2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications - Communication
  and Information Systems Security Symposium",,,,"cs.GT cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as delivery systems of online
goods is rapidly becoming a global norm, as corroborated by Amazon's ""Prime
Air"" and Google's ""Project Wing"" projects. However, the real-world deployment
of such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges.
In this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the
security of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum
network interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone
delivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to
find the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from
the vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time.
Meanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the
potential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it,
thus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this
game is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the
vendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the
game. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective
perception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective
valuations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery
time. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the
vendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which
inflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which
surpass the target delivery time set by the vendor.

assuming the holographic principle holds when a charged particle approaches a
screen enclosing the emerged part of the spacetime due to a source. We assume
that the entropy of the screen changes when the charge approaches as in the
Verlinde's approach. Thereafter, we obtain the entropic Maxwell equations in
both classical and covariant form by means of the holographic principle hold
for the source. Considering the gauge covariant structure of the fundamental
forces, we implicitly generalize the entropic origin of the electromagnetic
force into the strong and weak nuclear forces. The possibility of the entropic
origin of the all fundamental forces of nature is assumed to make a meaningful
contribution to the unification scheme of the fundamental forces.

a quasi-one dimensional, normal metal wire, where the transport is diffusive,
connected between equilibrium reservoirs. When an ac bias is applied to the
wire by means of the reservoirs, the statistics of the charge carriers is
influence by the formed non-equilibrium. The proposed model is derived from
Green function formalism. The quasi-particle energy distribution is calculated
with a quantum diffusion equation including a collision term accounting for
inelastic scattering. The ac bias, due to high frequency irradiation, drives
the wire out of equilibrium. For coherent transport the photon absorption
processes create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the
number of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field
eV and the photon energy \omega. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field
regime, \omega \tau_D < 1, the photon absorption is highly time-dependent. In
the fast field regime \omega \tau_D > 1 this time-dependency disappears and the
photon steps in the distribution have a fixed value. When the wire is extended,
the transport becomes incoherent due to interaction processes, like
electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction. These
interactions give rise to a redistribution of the quasi-particles with respect
to the energy. We focused on the fast field regime and concluded that the
strong interaction limit for both mechanisms gives the expected result. Strong
electron-phonon interaction forces the distribution function on every position
in the wire to become a Fermi function with the bath temperature, while strong
electron-electron interaction causes an effective temperature profile across
the wire and the distribution function on every position in the wire is a Fermi
function with an effective temperature.
