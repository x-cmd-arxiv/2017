Adequate resource implementation in mass customization-particularly in terms of
resource usage, it is therefore important to meet customer's requirement in
terms effective responsiveness and meeting deadlines, at the same time offering
high scalability. An architecture for solving the resource allocation issue in
mass customized flexible manufacturing system was illustrated, by putting in
place a couple of advance reservation systems and scheduling algorithms for

  Lightweight Algorithms and Object-based Models","preprint for IJRR submission",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the following problem: a team of robots is deployed in an unknown
environment and it has to collaboratively build a map of the area without a
reliable infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern mapping
techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the
robots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this
paper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather
than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots
exchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose
graph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed
implementation of the two-stage approach of Carlone et al., where we use the
Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation (JOR) as
workhorses to split the computation among the robots. As a second contribution,
we extend %and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed distributed
algorithms to work with object-based map models. The use of object-based models
avoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g., point clouds) further
reducing the communication burden. Our third contribution is an extensive
experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, including tests in
realistic Gazebo simulations and field experiments in a military test facility.
Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the proposed algorithms
(the Distributed Gauss-Seidel method or DGS) has excellent performance. The DGS
requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales well to
large teams, is robust to noise, and is easy to implement. Our field tests show
that the combined use of our distributed algorithms and object-based models
reduces the communication requirements by several orders of magnitude and
enables distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world problems.

and 11.3 $\mu$m are ubiquitously seen in various astrophysical regions. The UIE
features are characteristic of the stretching and bending vibrations of
aromatic hydrocarbons. The 3.3 $\mu$m feature resulting from aromatic C--H
stretches is often accompanied by a weaker feature at 3.4 $\mu$m often
attributed to aliphatic C--H stretches. The ratio of the observed intensity of
the 3.3 $\mu$m aromatic C--H feature ($I_{3.3}$) to that of the 3.4 $\mu$m
aliphatic C--H feature ($I_{3.4}$) allows one to estimate the aliphatic
fraction (i.e. $N_{\rm C,aliph}/N_{\rm C,arom}$, the number of C atoms in
aliphatic units to that in aromatic rings) of the UIE carriers, provided the
intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 3.3 $\mu$m aromatic C--H stretch
($A_{3.3}$) and the 3.4 $\mu$m aliphatic C--H stretch ($A_{3.4}$) are known.
  In this article we summarize the computational results on $A_{3.3}$ and
$A_{3.4}$ and their implications for the aromaticity and aliphaticity of the
UIE carriers. We use density functional theory and second-order perturbation
theory to derive $A_{3.3}$ and $A_{3.4}$ from the infrared vibrational spectra
of seven PAHs with various aliphatic substituents (e.g., methyl-, dimethyl-,
ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-PAHs, and PAHs with unsaturated alkyl-chains). The mean
band strengths of the aromatic ($A_{3.3}$) and aliphatic ($A_{3.4}$) C--H
stretches are derived and then employed to estimate the aliphatic fraction of
the UIE carriers by comparing $A_{3.4}$/$A_{3.3}$ with $I_{3.4}$/$I_{3.3}$. We
conclude that the UIE emitters are predominantly aromatic, as revealed by the
observationally-derived ratio <$I_{3.4}$/$I_{3.3}$> ~ 0.12 and the
computationally-derived ratio <$A_{3.4}$/$A_{3.3}$> ~ 1.76 which suggest an
upper limit of $N_{\rm C,aliph}/N_{\rm C,arom}$ ~ 0.02 for the aliphatic
fraction of the UIE carriers.

scenarios to explode core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Both are based on the
negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). In the jittering jets scenario a
collapsing core of a single slowly-rotating star can launch jets. The accretion
disk or belt (a sub-Keplerian accretion flow concentrated toward the equatorial
plane) that launches the jets is intermittent with varying directions of the
axis. Instabilities, such as the standing accretion shock instability (SASI),
lead to stochastic angular momentum variations that allow the formation of the
intermittent accretion disk/belt. According to this scenario no failed CCSNe
exist. According to the fixed axis scenario, the core of the progenitor star
must be spun up during its late evolutionary phases, and hence all CCSNe are
descendants of strongly interacting binary systems, most likely through a
common envelope evolution (whether the companion survives or not). Due to the
strong binary interaction, the axis of the accretion disk that is formed around
the newly born neutron star has a more or less fixed direction. According to
the fixed axis scenario, accretion disk/belt are not formed around the newly
born neutron star of single stars; they rather end in failed CCSNe. I also
raise the possibility that the jittering jets scenario operates for progenitors
with initial mass of 8Mo<M(ZAMS)<18Mo, while the fixed axis scenario operates
for M(ZAMS)>18Mo. For the first time these two scenarios are compared to each
other, as well as to some aspects of neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. These
new comparisons further suggest that the JFM plays a major role in exploding
massive stars.

estimating the propensity model parameter needs to be incorporated. In this
paper, we propose an approximate Bayesian approach to handle unit nonresponse
with parametric model assumptions on the response probability, but without
model assumptions for the outcome variable. The proposed Bayesian method is
calibrated to the frequentist inference in that the credible region obtained
from the posterior distribution asymptotically matches to the frequentist
confidence interval obtained from the Taylor linearization method. Unlike the
frequentist approach, however, the proposed method does not involve Taylor
linearization. The proposed method can be extended to handle over-identified
cases in which there are more estimating equations than the parameters.
Besides, the proposed method can also be modified to handle nonignorable
nonresponse. Results from two simulation studies confirm the validity of the
proposed methods, which are then applied to data from a Korean longitudinal
survey.

non-equilibrium phenomena in many-body Physics. Here we discuss two recently
explored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to
closed (i.e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have
apparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it
freezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it
delocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference
is responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more
general questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and
finally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues
in periodically driven closed many-body systems. In this article we intend to
deliver a non-technical account of some recent developments in this field in a
manner accessible to a broad readership.

class of intelligent sensing systems. To achieve the full potential of such
drones, it is necessary to develop new enhanced formulations of both common and
emerging sensing scenarios. Namely, several fundamental challenges in visual
sensing remain unsolved including: 1) Fitting sizable targets in camera frames;
2) Effective viewpoints matching target poses; 3) Occlusion by elements in the
environment, including other targets. In this paper, we introduce Argus: an
autonomous system that utilizes drones to incrementally collect target
information through a two-tier architecture. To tackle the stated challenges,
Argus employs a novel geometric model that captures both target shapes and
coverage constraints. Recognizing drones as the scarcest resource, Argus aims
to minimize the number of drones required to cover a set of targets. We prove
this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate, before deriving a
best-possible approximation algorithm along with a competitive sampling
heuristic which runs up to 100x faster according to large-scale simulations. To
test Argus in action, we demonstrate and analyze its performance on a prototype
implementation. Finally, we present a number of extensions to accommodate more
application requirements and highlight some open problems.

They are prevalent and testing them is important and challenging. Existing
approaches for testing configurable systems are either unsound (i.e., they can
miss fault-revealing configurations) or do not scale. This paper proposes
EvoSPLat, a regression testing technique for configurable systems. EvoSPLat
builds on our previously-developed technique, SPLat, which explores all
dynamically reachable configurations from a test. EvoSPLat is tuned for two
scenarios of use in regression testing: Regression Configuration Selection
(RCS) and Regression Test Selection (RTS). EvoSPLat for RCS prunes
configurations (not tests) that are not impacted by changes whereas EvoSPLat
for RTS prunes tests (not configurations) which are not impacted by changes.
Handling both scenarios in the context of evolution is important. Experimental
results show that EvoSPLat is promising. We observed a substantial reduction in
time (22%) and in the number of configurations (45%) for configurable Java
programs. In a case study on a large real-world configurable system (GCC),
EvoSPLat reduced 35% of the running time. Comparing EvoSPLat with sampling
techniques, 2-wise was the most efficient technique, but it missed two bugs
whereas EvoSPLat detected all bugs four times faster than 6-wise, on average.

regions are one of the most salient manifestations of topology in physics.
Metallic boundary states of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators
(TIs), a realization of topological order in condensed matter, have been of
much interest not only due to such a fundamental nature, but also due to their
practical significance. These boundary states are immune to backscattering and
localization owing to their topological origin, thereby opening up the
possibility to tailor them for potential uses in spintronics and quantum
computing. The heterojunction between a TI and a normal insulator (NI) is a
representative playground for exploring such a topologically protected metallic
boundary state and expected to constitute a building block for future
electronic and spintronic solid-state devices based on TIs. Here, we report a
first-principles study of two experimentally realized lattice-matched
heterojunctions between TIs and NIs, Bi$_2$Se$_3$(0001)/InP(111) and
Bi$_2$Te$_3$(0001)/BaF$_2$(111). We evaluate the band offsets at these
interfaces from many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ approximation as
well as density-functional theory. Furthermore, we investigate the topological
interface states, demonstrating that at these lattice-matched heterointerfaces
they are strictly localized and their helical spin textures are as well
preserved as those at the vacuum-facing surfaces. These results taken together
may help in designing devices relying on spin-helical metallic boundary states
of TIs.

suspension of self-propelled rods (swimmers) in a planar channel subjected to
an imposed shear flow. To best capture the salient features of shear-induced
effects, we consider the case of an imposed Couette flow, providing a constant
shear rate across the channel. We argue that the steady-state behavior of
swimmers can be understood in the light of a population splitting phenomenon,
occurring as the shear rate exceeds a certain threshold, initiating the
reversal of swimming direction for a finite fraction of swimmers from down- to
upstream or vice versa, depending on swimmer position within the channel.
Swimmers thus split into two distinct, statistically significant and oppositely
swimming majority and minority populations. The onset of population splitting
translates into a transition from a self-propulsion-dominated regime to a
shear-dominated regime, corresponding to a unimodal-to-bimodal change in the
probability distribution function of the swimmer orientation. We present a
phase diagram in terms of the swim and flow Peclet numbers showing the
separation of these two regimes by a discontinuous transition line. Our results
shed further light on the behavior of swimmers in a shear flow and provide an
explanation for the previously reported non-monotonic behavior of the mean,
near-wall, parallel-to-flow orientation of swimmers with increasing shear
strength.

crucial constraint for modelling disc formation and evolution. Open clusters
allow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and its evolution
over time. In this paper we perform the first investigation of the present-day
radial metallicity distribution based on [Fe/H] determinations in late type
members of pre-main-sequence clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters
are therefore essential for tracing the current inter-stellar medium
metallicity. We used the products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young
regions (age<100 Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc.
For the first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions
farther than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through
samples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership analysis
is discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters (Chamaeleon I
and Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in our previous works. All
the pre-main-sequence clusters considered in this paper have close-to-solar or
slightly sub-solar metallicities. The radial metallicity distribution traced by
these clusters is almost flat, with the innermost star forming regions having
[Fe/H] values that are 0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older
clusters located at similar Galactocentric radii. This homogeneous study of the
present-day radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc favours
models that predict a flattening of the radial gradient over time. On the other
hand, the decrease of the average [Fe/H] at young ages is not easily explained
by the models. Our results reveal a complex interplay of several processes
(e.g. star formation activity, initial mass function, supernova yields, gas
flows) that controlled the recent evolution of the Milky Way.

correctly anticipate a robot's behavior in novel situations. Since a robot's
behavior is often a direct result of its underlying objective function, our
insight is that end-users need to have an accurate mental model of this
objective function in order to understand and predict what the robot will do.
While people naturally develop such a mental model over time through observing
the robot act, this familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach
reduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from
observed behavior, and then it selects those behaviors that are maximally
informative. The problem of computing a posterior over objectives from observed
behavior is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has been applied
to robots learning human objectives. We consider the problem where the roles of
human and robot are swapped. Our main contribution is to recognize that unlike
robots, humans will not be exact in their IRL inference. We thus introduce two
factors to define candidate approximate-inference models for human learning in
this setting, and analyze them in a user study in the autonomous driving
domain. We show that certain approximate-inference models lead to the robot
generating example behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what it
will do in novel situations. Our results also suggest, however, that additional
research is needed in modeling how humans extrapolate from examples of robot
behavior.

cross sections are general non-convex analytic planar domain. We establish the
global-wellposedness and asymptotic stability of the Boltzmann equation with
the specular reflection boundary condition in such domains. Our method consists
of sharp classification of billiard trajectories which bounce infinitely many
times or hit the boundary tangentially at some moment, and a delicate
construction of an $\e$-tubular neighborhood of such trajectories. Analyticity
of the boundary is crucially used. Away from such $\e$-tubular neighborhood, we
control the number of bounces of trajectories and its' distance from singular
sets in a uniform fashion. The worst case, sticky grazing set, can be excluded
by cutting off small portion of the temporal integration. Finally we apply a
method of \cite{KimLee} by the authors and achieve a pointwise estimate of the
Boltzmann solutions.

neuroscience studies. As the standard assumption of independent and identically
distributed samples does not hold for such data, two important problems are to
accurately estimate group-level effect sizes, and to obtain powerful
statistical tests against group-level null hypotheses. A common approach is to
summarize subject-level data by a single quantity per subject, which is often
the mean or the difference between class means, and treat these as samples in a
group-level t-test. This 'naive' approach is, however, suboptimal in terms of
statistical power, as it ignores information about the intra-subject variance.
To address this issue, we review several approaches to deal with nested data,
with a focus on methods that are easy to implement. With what we call the
sufficient-summary-statistic approach, we highlight a computationally efficient
technique that can improve statistical power by taking into account
within-subject variances, and we provide step-by-step instructions on how to
apply this approach to a number of frequently-used measures of effect size. The
properties of the reviewed approaches and the potential benefits over a
group-level t-test are quantitatively assessed on simulated data and
demonstrated on EEG data from a simulated-driving experiment.

around the visible spectrum. As their plasmonic resonances depend heavily on
the NC geometry, modern fabrication techniques afford a great degree of control
over their optical responses. We take advantage of this fact to create optical
filters in the visible-near IR. Our systems show an extinction spectrum that
covers a wide range of wavelengths (UV to mid-IR), while featuring a narrow
transparency band around a wavelength of choice. We achieve this by carefully
selecting the geometries of a collection of NCs with narrow resonances that
cover densely the spectrum from UV to mid-IR except for the frequencies
targeted for transmission. This fundamental design can be executed in different
kinds of systems, including a solution of colloidal metal NCs (metafluids), a
structured planar metasurface or a combination of both. Along with the theory,
we report experimental results, showing metasurface realizations of the system,
and we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these different approaches,
paying particular attention to particle-particle interaction and to what extent
it hinders the intended objective by shifting and modifying the profile of the
planned resonances through the hybridization of their plasmonic modes. We have
found that the Beer-Lambert law is very robust overall and is violated only

Improving upon earlier results (Karaa {\it et al.}, IMA J. Numer. Anal. 2016),
optimal error estimates in $L^2(\Omega)$- and $H^1(\Omega)$-norms for the
semidiscrete problem with smooth and middly smooth initial data, i.e., $v\in
H^2(\Omega)\cap H^1_0(\Omega)$ and $v\in H^1_0(\Omega)$ are established. For
nonsmooth data, that is, $v\in L^2(\Omega)$, the optimal $L^2(\Omega)$-error
estimate is shown to hold only under an additional assumption on the
triangulation, which is known to be satisfied for symmetric triangulations.
Superconvergence result is also proved and as a consequence, a quasi-optimal
error estimate is established in the $L^\infty(\Omega)$-norm. Further, two
fully discrete schemes using convolution quadrature in time generated by the
backward Euler and the second-order backward difference methods are analyzed,
and error estimates are derived for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data.
Based on a comparison of the standard Galerkin finite element solution with the
FVE solution and exploiting tools for Laplace transforms with semigroup type
properties of the FVE solution operator, our analysis is then extended in a
unified manner to several time-fractional order evolution problems. Finally,
several numerical experiments are conducted to confirm our theoretical

between the entanglement entropy $S(x)$ and the parton distribution $xG(x)$
becomes very simple: $S(x) = \ln[ xG(x) ]$. In this small $x$, large rapidity
$Y$ regime, all partonic micro-states have equal probabilities -- the proton is
composed by an exponentially large number $\exp(\Delta Y)$ of micro-states that
occur with equal and exponentially small probabilities $\exp(-\Delta Y)$, where
$\Delta$ is defined by $xG(x) \sim 1/x^\Delta$. For this equipartitioned state,
the entanglement entropy is maximal -- so at small $x$, deep inelastic
scattering probes a {\it maximally entangled state}. We propose the
entanglement entropy as an observable that can be studied in deep inelastic
scattering. This will require event-by-event measurements of hadronic final

impurity scattering at finite temperature is explored theoretically. The
anisotropic electronic structure enters the calculation for the polarizability

temperature, scattering is not limited to the Fermi surface and the
polarizability is temperature dependent. The impact of screening is
investigated in detail with its dependence on carrier density and temperature.
Competing with the thermal excitation effects, the temperature dependence of
the polarizability is found to dominate for T<100K. As a result, the charge
carrier mobility slowly decreases with increasing temperature. The weak
temperature dependence of the mobility and its anisotropy ratio of 1.9-3.2
agree with published experimental data.

very different from that of single-scalar field models. It is well known that
both the tensor and scalar perturbation equations of the later can always be
written as a supersymmetric Schr\""{o}dinger equation, so it can be shown that
the perturbations are stable at linear level. However, in general it is not
true for multi-scalar field models and especially there is no effective method
to deal with the stability problem of the scalar perturbations for braneworld
models constructed with non-minimally coupled multi-scalar fields. In this
paper we present a method to investigate the stability of such braneworld
models. It is easy to find that the tensor perturbations are stable. For the
stability problem of the scalar perturbations, we present a systematic
covariant approach. The covariant quadratic order action and the corresponding
first-order perturbed equations are derived. By introducing the orthonormal
bases in field space and making the Kaluza-Klein decomposition, we show that
the Kaluza-Klein modes of the scalar perturbations satisfy a set of coupled
Schr\""{o}dinger-like equations, with which the stability of the scalar
perturbations and localization of the scalar zero modes can be analyzed
according to nodal theorem. The result depends on the explicit models. For
superpotential derived barane models, the scalar perturbations are stable, but
there exist normalizable scalar zero modes, which will result in unaccepted
fifth force on the brane. We also use this method to analyze the $f(R)$
braneworld model with an explicit solution and find that the scalar
perturbations are stable and the scalar zero modes can not be localized on the
brane, which ensure that there is no extra long-range force and the Newtonian
potential on the brane can be recovered.

processing, sparse representation (SR) has attracted significant attention in
multi-sensor image fusion. Unlike the traditional multiscale transforms (MSTs)
that presume the basis functions, SR learns an over-complete dictionary from a
set of training images for image fusion, and it achieves more stable and
meaningful representations of the source images. By doing so, the SR-based
fusion methods generally outperform the traditional MST-based image fusion
methods in both subjective and objective tests. In addition, they are less
susceptible to mis-registration among the source images, thus facilitating the
practical applications. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the
SR-based multi-sensor image fusion literature, highlighting the pros and cons
of each category of approaches. Specifically, we start by performing a
theoretical investigation of the entire system from three key algorithmic
aspects, (1) sparse representation models; (2) dictionary learning methods; and
(3) activity levels and fusion rules. Subsequently, we show how the existing
works address these scientific problems and design the appropriate fusion rules
for each application, such as multi-focus image fusion and multi-modality
(e.g., infrared and visible) image fusion. At last, we carry out some
experiments to evaluate the impact of these three algorithmic components on the
fusion performance when dealing with different applications. This article is
expected to serve as a tutorial and source of reference for researchers
preparing to enter the field or who desire to employ the sparse representation
theory in other fields.

organisation name recognition. A popular approach to entity extraction is based
on matching sub-string candidates in a document against a dictionary of
entities. To handle spelling errors and name variations of entities, usually
the matching is approximate and edit or Jaccard distance is used to measure
dissimilarity between sub-string candidates and the entities. For approximate
entity extraction from free text, existing work considers solely
character-based or solely token-based similarity and hence cannot
simultaneously deal with minor variations at token level and typos. In this
paper, we address this problem by considering both character-based similarity
and token-based similarity (i.e. two-level similarity). Measuring one-level
(e.g. character-based) similarity is computationally expensive, and measuring
two-level similarity is dramatically more expensive. By exploiting the
properties of the two-level similarity and the weights of tokens, we develop
novel techniques to significantly reduce the number of sub-string candidates
that require computation of two-level similarity against the dictionary of
entities. A comprehensive experimental study on real world datasets show that
our algorithm can efficiently extract entities from documents and produce a
high F1 score in the range of [0.91, 0.97].

Here, we provide the first consistency guarantees, both uniform and
high-dimensional, of a greedy permutation-based search. This search corresponds
to a simplex-like algorithm operating over the edge-graph of a sub-polytope of
the permutohedron, called a DAG associahedron. Every vertex in this polytope is
associated with a directed acyclic graph, and hence with a collection of
permutations that are consistent with the directed acyclic graph ordering. A
walk is performed on the edges of the polytope maximizing the sparsity of the
associated directed acyclic graphs. We show via simulated and real data that
this permutation search is competitive with current approaches.

computing. All nodes of a network have to agree on a single node, called the
leader. If the nodes of the network have distinct labels, then agreeing on a
single node means that all nodes have to output the label of the elected
leader.
  If the nodes are anonymous, the task of leader election is formulated as
follows: every node of the network must output a simple path starting at it,
which is coded as a sequence of port numbers, such that all these paths end at
a common node, the leader. In this paper, we study deterministic leader
election in anonymous trees.
  Our goal is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\tau$ and the
amount of information that has to be given {\em a priori} to the nodes of a
network to enable leader election in time $\tau$. Following the framework of
{\em algorithms with advice}, this information is provided to all nodes at the
start by an oracle knowing the entire tree, in form of binary strings assigned
to all nodes. There are two possible variants of formulating this advice
assignment. Either the strings provided to all nodes are identical, or strings
assigned to different nodes may be potentially different, i.e., advice can be
{\em customized}. As opposed to previous papers on leader election with advice,
in this paper we consider the latter option.
  The maximum length of all assigned binary strings is called the {\em size of
advice}.
  For a given time $\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give upper and lower
bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform leader election in
time $\tau$. All our bounds except one pair are tight up to multiplicative
constants, and in this one exceptional case, the gap between the upper and the

has also been shown that even for a monoatomic gas, both the q-partition
function $Z$ and the mean energy $<U>$ diverge and, in particular, exhibit
poles for certain values of the Tsallis non additivity parameter $q$. This
happens because $Z$ and $<U>$ both depend on a $\Gamma$-function. This
$\Gamma$, in turn, depends upon the spatial dimension $\nu$. We encounter three
different regimes according to the argument $A$ of the $\Gamma$-function. (1)
$A>0$, (2) $A<0$ and $\Gamma>0$ outside the poles. (3) $A$ displays poles and
the physics is obtained via dimensional regularization. In cases (2) and (3)
one discovers gravitational effects and quartets of particles. Moreover, bound
states and gravitational effects emerge as a consequence of the hidden
q-correlations.

  Static Plane Symmetric Spacetimes","23 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1701.06900",,,,"gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Considering the degenerate and non-degenerate cases, we provide a complete
classification of static plane symmetric spacetimes according to conformal
Ricci collineations (CRCs) and conformal matter collineations (CMCs). In case
of non-degenerate Ricci tensor, a general form of vector field generating CRCs
is found in terms of unknown functions of t and x, subject to some
integrability conditions. The integrability conditions are then solved in
different cases depending upon the nature of Ricci tensor and it is concluded
that static plane symmetric spacetimes possess 7, 10 or 15-dimensional Lie
algebra of CRCs. Moreover, it is found that these spacetimes admit infinite
number of CRCs when the Ricci tensor is degenerate. A similar procedure is
adopted for the study of CMCs in degenerate and non-degenerate matter tensor
cases. The exact form of some static plane symmetric spacetimes metrics is
obtained admitting non-trivial CRCs and CMCs. Finally, we present some physical
implications of our obtained results by considering a perfect fluid as a source
of the energy-momentum tensor.

  Learning","Typos corrected and new examples added to appendix",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In modern machine learning, pattern recognition replaces realtime semantic
reasoning. The mapping from input to output is learned with fixed semantics by
training outcomes deliberately. This is an expensive and static approach which
depends heavily on the availability of a very particular kind of prior raining
data to make inferences in a single step. Conventional semantic network
approaches, on the other hand, base multi-step reasoning on modal logics and
handcrafted ontologies, which are ad hoc, expensive to construct, and fragile
to inconsistency. Both approaches may be enhanced by a hybrid approach, which
completely separates reasoning from pattern recognition. In this report, a
quasi-linguistic approach to knowledge representation is discussed, motivated
by spacetime structure. Tokenized patterns from diverse sources are integrated
to build a lightly constrained and approximately scale-free network. This is
then be parsed with very simple recursive algorithms to generate
`brainstorming' sets of reasoned knowledge.
