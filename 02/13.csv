non-uniformly elliptic families of differential operators describing the
behaviour of periodic composite media with high contrast, we study the
corresponding one-dimensional version that includes a ""defect"": an inclusion of
fixed size with a given set of material parameters. It is known that the
spectrum of the purely periodic case without the defect and its limit, as the
period $\varepsilon$ goes to zero, has a band-gap structure. We consider a
sequence of eigenvalues $\lambda_\varepsilon$ that are induced by the defect
and converge to a point $\l_0$ located in a gap of the limit spectrum for the
periodic case. We show that the corresponding eigenfunctions are ""extremely""
localised to the defect, in the sense that the localisation exponent behaves as
$\exp(-\nu/\varepsilon),$ $\nu>0,$ which has not been observed in the existing
literature. As a consequence, we argue that $\l_0$ is an eigenvalue of a
certain limit operator defined on the defect only. In two- and
three-dimensional configurations, whose one-dimensional cross-sections are
described by the setting considered, this implies the existence of propagating
waves that are localised to the defect. We also show that the unperturbed
operators are norm-resolvent close to a degenerate operator on the real axis,

of identical LTI dynamical systems. A new subspace identification method is
developed that only uses local input-output information and does not rely on
knowledge about the local state interaction. The identification of the local
system matrices (up to a similarity transformation) is done via a low
dimensional subspace retrieval step that enables the estimation of the Markov
parameters of a locally lifted system. Using the estimated Markov parameters,
the state-space realization of a single subsystem in the network is determined.
The low dimensional subspace retrieval step exploits various key structural
properties that are present in the data equation such as a low rank property
and a {\em two-layer} Toeplitz structure in the data matrices constructed from
products of the system matrices. For the estimation of the system matrices of a
single subsystem, it is formulated as a structured low-rank matrix
factorization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed identification method
is demonstrated by a simulation example.

a multi phase transport (AMPT) model at LHC energy. In the realms of AMPT model
we observe $\phi$-mesons at intermediate transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) deviate
from the previously observed (at RHIC) particle type grouping of $v_{2}$
according to the number of quark content i.e, baryons and mesons. Recent
results from the ALICE Collaboration have shown that $\phi$-meson and proton
$v_{2}$ has a similar trend, possibly indicating that particle type grouping
might be due to the mass of the particles and not the quark content. A stronger
radial boost at LHC compared to RHIC seems to offer a consistent explanation to
such observation. However, recalling that $\phi$-mesons decouple from the
hadronic medium before additional radial flow is build-up in the hadronic
phase, similar pattern in $\phi$-meson and proton $v_{2}$ may not be due to
radial flow alone.
  Our study reveals that models incorporating $\phi$-meson production from
$K\bar{K}$ fusion in the hadronic rescattering phase also predict a comparable
magnitude of $\phi$-meson and proton $v_{2}$ particularly in the intermediate
region of $p_{T}$. Whereas, $v_{2}$ of $\phi$-mesons created in the partonic
phase is in agreement with quark-coalescence motivated baryon-meson grouping of
hadron $v_{2}$. This observation seems to provide a plausible alternative
interpretation for the apparent mass-like behaviour of $\phi$-meson $v_{2}$. We
have also observed a violation of hydrodynamical mass ordering between proton
and $\phi$-meson $v_{2}$ further supporting that $\phi$-mesons are negligibly
affected by the collective radial flow in the hadronic phase due to the small
in-medium hadronic interaction cross sections.

particles on arbitrary trajectories is proposed. The basic concept is to use
one magnet system with a strong and homogeneous (dipolar) magnetic field to
magnetize and orient the particles. A second constantly graded field
(quadrupolar) is superimposed to the first to generate a force. In this
configuration the motion of the particles is driven solely by the component of
the gradient field which is parallel to the direction of the homogeneous field.
Then the particles are guided with constant force in a single direction over
the entire volume. The direction can be adjusted by varying the angle between
quadrupole and dipole. Since a single gradient is impossible, the other
gradient component determines the angular deviation of the force. The latter
can be neglected if the homogeneous field is stronger than the local
contribution of the gradient field. A possible realization is a coaxial
arrangement of two Halbach cylinders. A dipole produces a strong and
homogeneous field to evenly magnetize the particles, while the second cylinder
is a quadrupole to generate the force. A simple prototype was constructed to
demonstrate the principle on several nano-particles, which were moved along a
rough square by manually changing the force angle. The observed velocities of
particles were always several orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical
value. This discrepancy is attributed to the observed formation of long
particle chains as a result of their polarization by the homogeneous field. The
magnetic moment of such a chain is then the combination of that of its
constituents. A complete system will consist of another quadrupole (third
cylinder) to additionally scale the strength of the force by another rotation.
In this configuration the device could then also be used as a simple MRI
machine to image the particles.

Electrophysiological recordings provide detailed information about neural
spiking but have traditionally been confined to a particular region or layer of
cortex. Here we develop new theoretical methods to study interactions between
and within two brain regions, based on experimental measurements of spiking
activity simultaneously recorded from the two regions. By systematically
comparing experimentally-obtained spiking statistics to (efficiently computed)
model spike rate statistics, we identify regions in model parameter space that
are consistent with the experimental data. We apply our new technique to dual
micro-electrode array in vivo recordings from two distinct regions: olfactory
bulb (OB) and anterior piriform cortex (PC). Our analysis predicts that: i)
inhibition within the afferent region (OB) has to be weaker than the inhibition
within PC, ii) excitation from PC to OB is generally stronger than excitation
from OB to PC, iii) excitation from PC to OB and inhibition within PC have to
both be relatively strong compared to presynaptic inputs from OB. These
predictions are validated in a spiking neural network model of the OB--PC
pathway that satisfies the many constraints from our experimental data. We find
when the derived relationships are violated, the spiking statistics no longer
satisfy the constraints from the data. In principle this modeling framework can
be adapted to other systems and be used to investigate relationships between
other neural attributes besides network connection strengths. Thus, this work
can serve as a guide to further investigations into the relationships of
various neural attributes within and across different regions during sensory
processing.

Therefore, ExB drifts cannot cause the crescent shapes. We performed a
high-resolution multi-scale simulation capturing sub-electron skin depth
scales. The results suggest that the crescent-shaped distributions are caused
by meandering orbits without necessarily requiring any additional processes
found at the magnetopause such as the highly asymmetric magnetopause ambipolar
electric field. We use an adiabatic Hamiltonian model of particle motion to
confirm that conservation of canonical momentum in the presence of magnetic
field gradients causes the formation of crescent shapes without invoking
asymmetries or the presence of an ExB drift. An important consequence of this
finding is that we expect crescent-shaped distributions also to be observed in
the magnetotail, a prediction that MMS will soon be able to test.

crucial in order to properly conduct further analyses, which otherwise can be

identifiability delicately depends on the underlying rank. By means of several
counterexamples, we demonstrate that our conditions are sharp if one wishes a
genuinely nonparametric setup; and in doing so we caution that popular remedies
such as structural assumptions or roughness penalties can easily fail. We then
propose a nonparametric registration method based on a ""local variation
measure"", the main element in elucidating identifiability. A key advantage of
the method is that it is free of any tuning or penalisation parameters
regulating the amount of alignment, thus circumventing the problem of
over/under-registration often encountered in practice. We provide asymptotic
theory for the resulting estimators under the identifiable regime, but also
under mild departures from identifiability, quantifying the resulting bias in

the $S$-divergence family, although possessing very strong outlier stability
properties, often have very poor small sample efficiency in the presence of
inliers and some are not even defined in the presence of a single empty cell;
this limits the practical applicability of these estimators, in spite of their
otherwise sound robustness properties and high asymptotic efficiency. Here, we
will study a penalized version of the $S$-divergences such that the resulting
minimum divergence estimators are free from these issues without altering their
robustness properties and asymptotic efficiencies. We will give a general proof
for the asymptotic properties of these minimum penalized $S$-divergence
estimators. This provides a significant addition to the literature as the
asymptotics of penalized divergences which are not finitely defined are
currently unavailable in the literature. The small sample advantages of the
minimum penalized $S$-divergence estimators are examined through an extensive
simulation study and some empirical suggestions regarding the choice of the

I}$: Analysis sparsity of $f$ means that the analysis coefficients $(\langle
f,\psi_i\rangle)_i$ are sparse, while synthesis sparsity means that $f=\sum_i
c_i\psi_i$ with sparse coefficients $(c_i)_i$. Here, sparsity of $c=(c_i)_i$
means $c\in\ell^p(I)$ for a given $p<2$. We show that both notions of sparsity
coincide if $\Psi={\rm SH}(\varphi,\psi;\delta)$ is a discrete (cone-adapted)
shearlet frame with 'nice' generators $\varphi,\psi$ and fine enough sampling
density $\delta>0$. The required 'niceness' is explicitly quantified in terms
of Fourier-decay and vanishing moment conditions.
  Precisely, we show that suitable shearlet systems simultaneously provide
Banach frames and atomic decompositions for the shearlet smoothness spaces
$\mathscr{S}_s^{p,q}$ introduced by Labate et al. Hence, membership in
$\mathscr{S}_s^{p,q}$ is simultaneously equivalent to analysis sparsity and to
synthesis sparsity w.r.t. the shearlet frame.
  As an application, we prove that shearlets yield (almost) optimal
approximation rates for cartoon-like functions $f$: If $\epsilon>0$, then
$\Vert f-f_N\Vert_{L^2}\lesssim N^{-(1-\epsilon)}$, where $f_N$ is a linear
combination of N shearlets. This might appear to be well-known, but the
existing proofs only establish this approximation rate w.r.t. the dual
$\tilde{\Psi}$ of $\Psi$, not w.r.t. $\Psi$ itself. This is not completely
satisfying, since the properties of $\tilde{\Psi}$ (decay, smoothness, etc.)
are largely unknown.
  We also consider $\alpha$-shearlet systems. For these, the shearlet
smoothness spaces have to be replaced by $\alpha$-shearlet smoothness spaces.
We completely characterize the embeddings between these spaces, allowing us to
decide whether sparsity w.r.t. $\alpha_1$-shearlets implies sparsity w.r.t.
$\alpha_2$-shearlets.

differential rotation have revealed that the sustenance of large scale fields
requires a flux of small scale magnetic helicity to be viable. Here we
generalize a minimalist analytic version of such galactic dynamos to explore
some heretofore unincluded contributions from shear on the total turbulent
energy and turbulent correlation time, with the helicity fluxes maintained by
either winds, diffusion, or magnetic buoyancy. We construct an analytic
framework for modeling the turbulent energy and correlation time as functions
of SN rate and shear. We compare our prescription with previous approaches that
only include rotation. The solutions depend separately on the rotation period
and the eddy turnover time and not just on their ratio (the Rossby number). We
consider models in which these two time scales are allowed to be independent
and also a case in which they are mutually dependent on radius when a radial
dependent SN rate model is invoked. For the case of a fixed rotation period (or
fixed radius) we show that the influence of shear is dramatic for low Rossby
numbers, reducing the correlation time of the turbulence, which in turn,
strongly reduces the saturation value of the dynamo compared to the case when
the shear is ignored. We also show that even in the absence of winds or
diffusive fluxes, magnetic buoyancy may be able to sustain sufficient helicity
fluxes to avoid quenching.

and merger simulations of polytropic binaries that have been carried out using
two very different numerical algorithms --- a finite-volume ""grid"" code and a
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that there is agreement in
both the ultimate outcomes of the evolutions and the intermediate stages if the
initial conditions for each code are chosen to match as closely as possible. We
find that even with closely matching initial setups, the time it takes to reach
a concordant evolution differs between the two codes because the initial depth
of contact cannot be matched exactly. There is a general tendency for SPH to
yield higher mass transfer rates and faster evolution to the final outcome. We
also present comparisons of simulations calculated from two different energy
equations: in one series we assume a polytropic equation of state and in the
other series an ideal gas equation of state. In the latter series of
simulations an atmosphere forms around the accretor which can exchange angular
momentum and cause a more rapid loss of orbital angular momentum. In the
simulations presented here, the effect of the ideal equation of state is to
de-stabilize the binary in both SPH and grid simulations, but the effect is
more pronounced in the grid code.

instability of their trajectories, and as such C-systems have mixing of all
orders and nonzero Kolmogorov entropy. The mixing property of all orders means
that all its correlation functions tend to zero and the question of a
fundamental interest is a speed at which they tend to zero. It was proven that
the speed of decay in the C-systems is exponential, that is, the observables on
the phase space become independent and uncorrelated exponentially fast. It is
important to specify the properties of the C-system which quantify the
exponential decay of correlations. We have found that the upper bound on the
exponential decay of the correlation functions universally depends on the value
of a system entropy. A quintessence of the analyses is that local and

doped with K was studied by ultraviolet, X-ray, and inverse photoemission, as

intercalation the Fermi level shifts toward the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital filling it up with donated electrons with the appearance of an
additional feature in the energy region of the occupied states. The electronic
bands are pinned 0.5 eV above and 0.4 eV below the Fermi level. The branching

Moreover, the evolution of the Mn L and N K edges reveals strong hybridization
between Mn 3d and N 2p states of MnPc and sheds light on the electron

applied to quantum gravity revealing the existence of an asymptotically safe
fixed point in spacetime dimensions higher than two. To facilitate this,
physical renormalization schemes are exploited where the renormalization group
flow equations take a form which is independent of the parameterisation of the
physical degrees of freedom (i.e. the gauge fixing condition and the choice of
field variables). Instead the flow equation depends on the anomalous dimensions
of reference observables. In the presence of spacetime boundaries we find that
the required balance between the Einstein-Hilbert action and
Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term is preserved by the beta functions.
Exploiting the $\varepsilon$-expansion near two dimensions we consider Einstein
gravity coupled to matter. Scheme independence is generically obscured by the
loop-expansion due to breaking of two-dimensional Weyl invariance. In schemes
which preserve two-dimensional Weyl invariance we avoid the loop expansion and
find a unique ultra-violet (UV) fixed point. At this fixed point the anomalous
dimensions are large and one must resum all loop orders to obtain the critical
exponents. Performing the resummation a set of universal scaling dimensions are
found. These scaling dimensions show that only a finite number of matter
interactions are relevant. This is a strong indication that quantum gravity is
renormalizable.

antiferromagnetic (AFM) and a peculiar frustrated phase (FRU) where two types

anomalous double peak in specific heat due to the existence of three phase
(FRU, PAF(AFM) and FM) transitions occurring in a close region to each other.

complex refractive index (RI). To do so, we show that coherent SI is
mathematically equivalent to a superposition of angled illuminations. It
follows that raw acquisitions for standard SI-enhanced quantitative-phase
images can be processed into complex electric-field maps describing sample
diffraction under angled illuminations. Standard diffraction tomography (DT)
computation can then be used to reconstruct the sample 3D RI distribution at
sub-diffraction resolutions. We demonstrate this concept by using a
SI-quantitative-phase imaging system to computationally reconstruct 3D RI
distributions of human breast (MCF-7) and colorectal (HT-29) adenocarcinoma
cells. Our experimental setup uses a spatial light modulator to generate
structured patterns at the sample and collects angle-dependent sample
diffraction using a common-path, off-axis interference configuration with no
moving components. Furthermore, this technique holds promise for easy pairing
with SI fluorescence microscopy, and important future extensions may include
multimodal, sub-diffraction resolution, 3D RI and fluorescent visualizations.

all-digital transmitter is derived. No restrictions on the number of levels of
a digital switched-mode power amplifier (SMPA) driving input, nor the pulse
encoding scheme employed, are made. This implies a high level of generality of
the proposed model. We show that all-digital transmitter (ADT) can be
represented as a series connection of the pulse encoder, discrete-time Volterra
series model of fixed degree and memory depth, and a linear time-varying system
with special properties. This result suggests a new analytically motivated
structure of a digital predistortion (DPD) of SMPA nonlinearities in ADT.
Numerical simulations in MATLAB are used to verify proposed baseband equivalent

and infer aspects of animal behavior. An HMM assumes that each data point from
a time series of observations stems from one of $N$ possible states. The states
are loosely connected to behavioral modes that manifest themselves at the
temporal resolution at which observations are made. However, due to advances in
tag technology, data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal
resolutions. Yet, inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are
collected, and which correspond to larger-scale behavioral processes, are not
yet answered via HMMs. We include additional hierarchical structures to the
basic HMM framework in order to incorporate multiple Markov chains at various
time scales. The hierarchically structured HMMs allow for behavioral inferences
at multiple time scales and can also serve as a means to avoid coarsening data.
Our proposed framework is one of the first that models animal behavior
simultaneously at multiple time scales, opening new possibilities in the area
of animal movement modeling. We illustrate the application of hierarchically
structured HMMs in two real-data examples: (i) vertical movements of harbor
porpoises observed in the field, and (ii) garter snake movement data collected
as part of an experimental design.

energy and total spin per unit cell, in which case it is shown that the spiral
ferrimagnetic order collapses at a critical hole concentration. Notably, our
analytical results in the doped regime are in very good agreement with density

has been a key diagnostic tool since the early days of pulsar astronomy. Of
particular importance is how pulsars evolve through the P-Pdot diagram with
time. Here we show that the decay of the inclination angle (alpha-dot) between
the magnetic and rotation axes plays a critical role. In particular, alpha-dot
strongly impacts on the braking torque, an effect which has been largely
ignored in previous work. We carry out simulations which include a negative
alpha-dot term, and show that it is possible to reproduce the observational
P-Pdot diagram without the need for either pulsars with long birth periods or
magnetic field decay. Our best model indicates a birth rate of 1 radio pulsar
per century and a total Galactic population of ~20000 pulsars beaming towards

player seeks to satisfy a formula of propositional logic by selecting a truth
assignment to a set of propositional variables under his control.
  The framework has proven popular within the multiagent community, however,
almost invariably, the work to date has been restricted to the case of pure
strategies. Such a focus is highly restrictive as the notion of randomised play
is fundamental to the theory of strategic games -- even very simple games can
fail to have pure-strategy equilibria, but every finite game has at least one
equilibrium in mixed strategies.
  To address this, the present work focuses on the complexity of algorithmic
problems dealing with mixed strategies in Boolean games. The main result is
that the problem of determining whether a two-player game has an equilibrium
satisfying a given payoff constraint is NEXP-complete. Based on this result, we
then demonstrate that a number of other decision problems, such as the
uniqueness of an equilibrium or the satisfaction of a given formula in
equilibrium, are either NEXP or coNEXP-complete. The proof techniques developed
in the course of this are then used to show that the problem of deciding
whether a given profile is in equilibrium is coNP^#P-hard, and the problem of
deciding whether a Boolean game has a rational-valued equilibrium is NEXP-hard,
and whether a two-player Boolean game has an irrational-valued equilibrium is
NEXP-complete. Finally, we show that determining whether the value of a
two-player zero-sum game exceeds a given threshold is EXP-complete.

mechanism to incentivize the buyers, who are aware of the auction, to further
propagate the information to their neighbors so that more buyers will
participate in the auction and hence, the seller will be able to make a higher
revenue. We propose a novel auction mechanism, called information diffusion
mechanism (IDM), which incentivizes the buyers to not only truthfully report
their valuations on the commodity to the seller, but also further propagate the
auction information to all their neighbors. In comparison, the direct extension
of the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in social networks can
also incentivize the information diffusion, but it will decrease the seller's
revenue or even lead to a deficit sometimes. The formalization of the problem

assessed by identifying the sign of the system maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE).
A positive (negative) MLE implies unstable (stable) rotor angle dynamics.
However, because the MLE may fluctuate between positive and negative values for
a long time after a severe disturbance, it is difficult to determine the system
stability when observing a positive or negative MLE without knowing its further
fluctuation trend. In this paper, a new approach for online rotor angle
stability assessment is proposed to address this problem. The MLE is estimated
by a recursive least square (RLS) based method based on real-time rotor angle
measurements, and two critical parameters, the Theiler window and the MLE
estimation initial time step, are carefully chosen to make sure the calculated
MLE curves present distinct features for different stability conditions. By
using the proposed stability assessment criteria, the developed approach can
provide timely and reliable assessment of the rotor angle stability. Extensive
tests on the New-England 39-bus system and the Northeast Power Coordinating

observed over time. Statistical models for such data should capture not only
the temporal dependencies between networks observed in time, but also the
structural dependencies among the nodes and edges in each network. As a
consequence, effectively making inference on dynamic networks is a
computationally challenging task, and many models established for dynamic
networks are intractable even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we
propose and investigate a family of dynamic network models, known as
varying-coefficient exponential random graph models (VCERGMs), that
characterize the evolution of network topology through smoothly varying
parameters in an exponential family of distributions. The VCERGM provides an
interpretable dynamic network model that enables the inference of temporal
heterogeneity in a dynamic network. We establish how to fit the VCERGM through
maximum pseudo-likelihood techniques, and thus provide a computationally
tractable method for statistical inference of complex dynamic networks. We
furthermore devise a bootstrap hypothesis testing framework for testing the
temporal heterogeneity of an observed dynamic network sequence. We apply the
VCERGM to the US Congress co-voting network and a resting-state brain
connectivity case study and show that our method provides relevant and
interpretable patterns describing each data set. Comprehensive simulation

  the normal gauge",,,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we analyze the local and global boundary rigidity problem for
general Riemannian manifolds with boundary $(M,g)$. We show that the boundary
distance function, i.e., $d_g|_{\partial M\times\partial M}$, known near a
point $p\in \partial M$ at which $\partial M$ is strictly convex, determines
$g$ in a suitable neighborhood of $p$ in $M$, up to the natural diffeomorphism
invariance of the problem.
  We also consider the closely related lens rigidity problem which is a more
natural formulation if the boundary distance is not realized by unique
minimizing geodesics. The lens relation measures the point and the direction of
exit from $M$ of geodesics issued from the boundary and the length of the
geodesic. The lens rigidity problem is whether we can determine the metric up
to isometry from the lens relation. We solve the lens rigidity problem under
the assumption that there is a function on $M$ with suitable convexity
properties relative to $g$. This can be considered as a complete solution of a
problem formulated first by Herglotz in 1905. We also prove a semi-global
results given semi-global data. This shows, for instance, that simply connected
manifolds with strictly convex boundaries are lens rigid if the sectional
curvature is non-positive or non-negative or if there are no focal points.
  The key tool is the analysis of the geodesic X-ray transform on 2-tensors,
corresponding to a metric $g$, in the normal gauge, such as normal coordinates
relative to a hypersurface, where one also needs to allow weights. This is
handled by refining and extending our earlier results in the solenoidal gauge.

Hamiltonian that essentially reduces the problem to that of a finite
non-Hermitian matrix for which it is straightforward to obtain the Jordan form.
In this paper, we demonstrate how the Hamiltonian of an open quantum system
reduces to Jordan block form at an exceptional point in an exact manner that
treats the continuum without any approximation. Our method relies on the
Brillouin-Wigner-Feshbach projection method according to which we can obtain a
finite dimensional effective Hamiltonian that shares the discrete sector of the
spectrum with the original Hamiltonian. While owing to its eigenvalue
dependence this effective Hamiltonian cannot be used to write the Jordan block
directly, we show that by formally extending the problem to include eigenstates
with complex eigenvalues that reside outside the usual Hilbert space, we can
obtain the Jordan block form at the exceptional point without introducing any
approximation. We also introduce an extended Jordan form basis away from the
exceptional point, which provides an alternative way to obtain the Jordan block
at an exceptional point. The extended Jordan block connects continuously to the
Jordan block exactly at the exceptional point implying that the observable
quantities are continuous at the exceptional point.

of $d^*\to NN\pi$ is about several hundred $\rm {KeV}$, while in the single
$\Delta\Delta$ channel it is just about $2\sim 3~\rm{MeV}$. We, therefore,
conclude that the partial width in the single-pion decay process of $d^*$ is
much smaller than the widths in its double-pion decay processes. Our prediction
may provide a criterion for judging different interpretations of the $d^*$
structure, as different pictures for the $d^*$ may result quite different
partial decay width.

of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation applying the two-dimensional
exciton-polariton model, we derive the self-consistent equations determining
simultaneously the excitonic and the photonic condenstate order parameters. In
the thermal equilibrium limit, we find a condensed state of the
exciton-polariton systems and phase diagrams are then constructed. At a given
low temperature, the condensate by its nature shows a crossover from an
excitonic to a polaritonic and finally photonic condensed state as the
excitation density increases at large detuning. Without the detuning, the
excitonic condensed state disappears whereas the polaritonic or photonic phases
dominate. The crossover is also found by lowering the Coulomb interaction at a
finite matter-light coupling. Lowering the Coulomb interaction or increasing
the temperature, the excitonic Mott transition occurs, at which the
exciton-polariton condensates dissociate to free electron-hole/photon.
Depending on temperature and excitation density, the phase transition of the
exciton-polariton condensates is also addressed in signatures of
photoluminescence mapping to the photonic momentum distribution.

the zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer, abbreviated ZPG TBL,
turbulent pipe flow and channel/duct flows has continued to receive intense
attention as new and more reliable experimental data have become available.
Nevertheless, the debate on whether the logarithmic part of the mean velocity
profile, in particular the K\'arm\'an constant $\kappa$, is identical for these
three canonical flows or flow-dependent is still ongoing. In this paper, which
expands upon Monkewitz and Nagib (24th ICTAM Conf., Montreal, 2016), the
asymptotic matching requirement of equal $\kappa$ in the log-law and in the
expression for the centerline/free-stream velocity is reiterated and shown to
preclude a single universal log-law in the three canonical flows or at least
make it very unlikely. The current re-analysis of high quality mean velocity
profiles in ZPG TBL's, the Princeton ""Superpipe"" and in channels and ducts
leads to a coherent description of (almost) all seemingly contradictory data
interpretations in terms of TWO logarithmic regions in pipes and channels: A
universal interior, near-wall logarithmic region with the same parameters as in
the ZPG TBL, in particular $\kappa_{\mathrm{wall}} \cong 0.384$, but only
extending from around $150$ to around $10^3$ wall units, and shrinking with
increasing pressure gradient, followed by an exterior logarithmic region with a
flow specific $\kappa$ matching the logarithmic slope of the respective
free-stream or centerline velocity. The log-law parameters of the exterior
logarithmic region in channels and pipes are shown to depend monotonically on
the pressure gradient.

This closest approach was probably linked to a fragmentation event of their

three different turbulent flows. The analysis is focused on the question as to
whether developed turbulent flows show universal small scale features. To
answer this question, 2-point statistics and joint multi-scale statistics of
longitudinal velocity increments are analysed. Evidence of the Markov property
for the turbulent cascade is shown, which corresponds to a 3-point closure that
reduces the joint multi-scale statistics to simple conditional probability
density functions (cPDF). The cPDF are described by the Fokker-Planck equation
in scale and its Kramers-Moyal coefficients (KMCs). KMCs are obtained by a
self-consistent optimisation procedure from the measured data and result in a
Fokker-Planck equation for each dataset. The knowledge of these stochastic
cascade equations enables to make use of the concepts of non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and thus to determine the entropy production along individual
cascade trajectories. In addition to this new concept, it is shown that the
local entropy production is nearly perfectly balanced for all datasets by the
integral fluctuation theorem (IFT). Thus the validity of the IFT can be taken
as a new law of the turbulent cascade and at the same time independently
confirms that the physics of the turbulent cascade is a memoryless Markov
process in scale. IFT is taken as a new tool to prove the optimal functional
form of the Fokker-Planck equations and subsequently to investigate the
question of universality of small scale turbulence. The results of our analysis
show that the turbulent cascade contains universal and non-universal features.
We identify small scale intermittency as a universality breaking feature. We
conclude that specific turbulent flows have their own particular multi-scale
cascade, with other words their own stochastic fingerprint.

type of assistance at the right moment. Such assistance systems are especially
relevant in laparoscopic surgery, where CAS can alleviate some of the drawbacks
that surgeons incur. For many assistance functions, e.g. displaying the
location of a tumor at the appropriate time or suggesting what instruments to
prepare next, analyzing the surgical workflow is a prerequisite. Since
laparoscopic interventions are performed via endoscope, the video signal is an
obvious sensor modality to rely on for workflow analysis.
  Image-based workflow analysis tasks in laparoscopy, such as phase
recognition, skill assessment, video indexing or automatic annotation, require
a temporal distinction between video frames. Generally computer vision based
methods that generalize from previously seen data are used. For training such
methods, large amounts of annotated data are necessary. Annotating surgical
data requires expert knowledge, therefore collecting a sufficient amount of
data is difficult, time-consuming and not always feasible.
  In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an unsupervised method
for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between
laparoscopic video frames on a temporal basis. We extract video frames at
regular intervals from 324 unlabeled laparoscopic interventions, resulting in a
dataset of approximately 2.2 million images. From this dataset, we extract
image pairs from the same video and train a CNN to determine their temporal
order. To solve this problem, the CNN has to extract features that are relevant
for comprehending laparoscopic workflow.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a CNN can be adapted for surgical
workflow segmentation. We performed image-based workflow segmentation on a
publicly available dataset of 7 cholecystectomies and 9 colorectal
interventions.

our strategy of employing the alternating direction method of multipliers

we gain computational efficiency, making new choices of loss functions

improvement both in accuracy and computational performance on the Microsoft

physical processes, and predict future outcomes, a complex computer model is
frequently required to simulate these dynamics. However there is inevitably
uncertainty related to the exact parametric form or the values of such
parameters to be used when developing these simulators, with \emph{ranges} of
plausible values prevalent in the literature. Systematic errors introduced by
failing to account for these uncertainties have the potential to have a large
effect on resulting estimates in unknown quantities of interest. Due to the
complexity of these types of models, it is often unfeasible to run large
numbers of training runs that are usually required for full statistical
emulators of the environmental processes. We therefore present a method for
accounting for uncertainties in complex environmental simulators without the
need for very large numbers of training runs and illustrate the method through
an application to the Met Office's atmospheric transport model NAME. We
conclude that there are two principle parameters that are linked with
variability in NAME outputs, namely the free tropospheric turbulence parameter
and particle release height. Our results suggest the former should be
significantly larger than is currently implemented as a default in NAME, whilst
changes in the latter most likely stem from inconsistencies between the model
specified ground height at the observation locations and the true height at
this location. Estimated discrepancies from independent data are consistent
with the discrepancy between modelled and true ground height.

comparison of resonant and nonresonant cases shows a significant excess of the
resonant rate. The polarization of the final photon in a strong magnetic field

transition. In this model, customers arrive at each product with a certain
probability. If the arrived product is unavailable, then the seller can
recommend a subset of available products to the customer and the customer will
purchase one of the recommended products or choose not to purchase with certain
transition probabilities. The distinguishing features of the model are that the
seller can control which products to recommend depending on the arrived product
and that each customer either purchases a product or leaves the market after
one transition.
  We study the assortment optimization problem under this model. Particularly,
we show that this problem is generally NP-Hard even if each product could only
transit to at most two products. Despite the complexity of the problem, we
provide polynomial time algorithms for several special cases, such as when the
transition probabilities are homogeneous with respect to the starting point, or
when each product can only transit to one other product. We also provide a
tight performance bound for revenue-ordered assortments. In addition, we
propose a compact mixed integer program formulation that can solve this problem
of large size. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that the
proposed algorithms can solve the problem efficiently and the obtained
assortments could significantly improve the revenue of the seller than under
the Markov chain choice model.

of magnetic properties is reported, even within mono-disperse samples of the
canonical ferromagnetic 3d transition metals. We address this issue by
investigating the magnetism of a large number of size- and shape-selected,
individual nanoparticles of Fe, Co, and Ni using a unique set of complementary
characterization techniques. At room temperature only superparamagnetic
behavior is observed in our experiments for all Ni nanoparticles within the
investigated sizes, which range from 8 to 20 nm. However, Fe and Co
nanoparticles can exist in two distinct magnetic states at any size in this
range: (i) a superparamagnetic state as expected from the bulk and surface
anisotropies known for the respective materials and as observed for Ni; and
(ii) a state with unexpected stable magnetization at room temperature. This
striking state is assigned to significant modifications of the magnetic
properties arising from metastable lattice defects in the core of the
nanoparticles as concluded by calculations and atomic structural
characterization. Also related with the structural defects, we find that the
magnetic state of Fe and Co nanoparticles can be tuned by thermal treatment
enabling one to tailor their magnetic properties for applications. This work
demonstrates the importance of complementary single particle investigations for
a better understanding of nanoparticle magnetism and for full exploration of

tSZ effect spectral distorsion does not depends on the redshift, and is only
slightly affected by the galaxy cluster properties via the relativistic
corrections, when the electrons reach relativistic velocities. The present work
proposes a linear component separation approach to extract the tSZ effect
Compton parameter and relativistic corrections for next-generation CMB
experiments. We demonstrated that relativistic corrections, if neglected, would
induce a significant bias on galaxy cluster Compton parameter, tSZ scaling
relation slope, and tSZ angular power spectrum shape measurements. We showed
that tSZ relativistic corrections mapping can be achieved at high
signal-to-noise ratio with a low level of contamination up to $\ell=3000$ for

produced by infra-red emission will be a significant source of bias. Such tSZ

lifetimes to the measured excitonic recombination times extracted from

the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), a spherical barotropic
quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, and equilibrium statistical mechanics. The QG
model reproduces well the evolution of the composite potential vorticity (PV)
field obtained from JRA-55 by considering a time-dependent effective topography
given by the composite height field of the 550 K potential temperature surface.
The zonal-wavenumber-2 component of the effective topography is the most
essential feature required to observe the vortex splitting. The
statistical-mechanics theory predicts a large-scale steady state as the most
probable outcome of turbulent stirring, and such a state can be computed
without solving the QG dynamics. The theory is applied to a disk domain, which
is modeled on the north polar cap in the stratosphere. The equilibrium state is
obtained by computing the maximum of an entropy functional. In the range of
parameters relevant to the winter stratosphere, this state is anticyclonic. By
contrast, cyclonic states are quasi-stationary states corresponding to saddle
points of the entropy functional. The theoretical calculations are compared
with the results of the quasi-static experiment in which the wavenumber-2
topographic amplitude is increased linearly and slowly with time. The results
suggest that S-SSWs can be qualitatively interpreted as the transition from the
cyclonic quasi-stationary state toward the anticyclonic equilibrium state. The
polar vortex splits during the transition toward the equilibrium state. Without
any forcing such as radiative cooling, the anticyclonic equilibrium state would
be realized sufficiently after an S-SSW.

amount of intensity modulation in the 7 observations taken during
September-November, 2003, covering 36 complete binary orbits of EXO 0748-676.
While assessing the non-burst variability, simultaneously in the optical and
X-ray light curves, we find that they are not correlated at reprocessing or
orbital time-scales, but are weakly correlated at a few 1000s of seconds
time-scales. Although a large fraction of the optical emission is likely to be
due to reprocessing, the lack of significant correlation and presence of large
variability in the orbital X-ray and optical light curves is probably due to
structures and structural changes in the accretion disk that produce, and
sometimes mask the reprocessed signal in varying amounts. These disk structures
could be induced, at least partly, by irradiation. From the observed
modulations seen in the optical light curves, there is strong evidence of
accretion disk evolution at time scales of a few hours.

very tiny in the space of X state parameters. We also discover the cases when
the conditional entropy has a local maximum inside the interval (0,\pi/2). It
is remarkable that the maxima exist in surprisingly wide regions and the
boundaries for such regions are defined by the same bifurcation conditions as

simulations of extensional necking in complex fluids and soft solids, during
the stress relaxation process following an interrupted strain ramp. We start by
deriving analytical criteria for necking within a highly simplified and
generalised scalar constitutive model. Here, we find two different possible
modes of necking: one associated with an upward curvature in the stress
relaxation function on a log-linear plot, and another related to a carefully
defined `elastic' derivative of the tensile force with respect to an imagined
sudden strain increment. We showed these two criteria to agree fully with
simulations of the Oldroyd B and Giesekus models of polymeric solutions, and
with the RoliePoly model of more concentrated polymeric solutions and melts,
without polymer chain stretch. With chain stretch included, we find a slightly
more complicated analytical criterion for necking during the stress relaxation,
with key ingredients that closely mirror counterpart ingredients of the simpler
criteria obtained within the scalar model. We show this criterion to agree
fully with slender filament simulations of the RoliePoly model with chain
stretch, and with the scenario discussed by the Copenhagen group in Refs. [1,
2]. In particular, we see delayed necking after strain ramps with an
accumulated strain exceeding ~ 0.7, for ramp rates exceeding the inverse chain
stretch relaxation timescale. We discuss finally an analogy between this
delayed necking following an interrupted extensional strain ramp and delayed
shear banding following an interrupted shear strain ramp [3]. This work
provides the counterpart, for interrupted extensional strain ramps, to earlier
papers giving criteria for necking in the protocols of constant imposed Hencky
strain rate [4] and of constant imposed tensile stress or constant imposed
tensile force [5].

the generation of streams of data at each source, we provide a lower and an
upper bound on the rate at which Fixed Random-Compute can compute the stream of

for our algorithm serves as a general lower bound for the function computation

asymmetric functions. We also provide upper bounds on the average time taken to

Fixed Random-Compute, and the mixing time in the case of Flexible

The numerical analysis of the emission from the single one-electron one

functions of bounded variation in arbitrary domains, of an inequality by Maz'ya
that improves Friedrichs inequality. A remarkable feature of such a proof is
that it is rather elementary, if the basic background in the theory of
functions of bounded variation is assumed. Never the less, it allows to extend
all the previously known versions of this fundamental inequality to a
completely general version. In fact the inequality presented here is optimal in
several respects.
  As already observed in previous proofs, the crucial step is to provide
conditions under which a function of bounded variation on a bounded open set,
extended to zero outside, has bounded variation on the whole space. We push
such conditions to their limits. In fact, we give a sufficient and necessary
condition if the open set has a boundary with $\sigma$-finite surface measure
and a sufficient condition if the open set is fully arbitrary. Via a
counterexample we show that such a general sufficient condition is sharp.

be traced back to old cartography where the basic problem was the search for
mappings from the sphere onto the plane with minimal deviation from
conformality, subject to certain conditions which were made precise. In this
paper, we survey the development of cartography, highlighting the main ideas
that are related to quasiconformality. Some of these ideas were completely
ignored in the previous historical surveys on quasiconformal mappings. We then
survey early quasiconformal theory in the works of Gr\""otzsch, Lavrentieff,
Ahlfors and Teichm\""uller, which are the 20th-century founders of the theory.
The period we consider starts with Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100--170 A.D.) and ends
with Oswald Teichm\""uller (1913--1943). We mention the works of several
mathematicians-geographers done in this period, including Euler, Lagrange,
Lambert, Gauss, Chebyshev, Darboux and others. We highlight in particular the
work of Nicolas-Auguste Tissot (1824--1897), a French mathematician and
geographer who (according to our knowledge) was the first to introduce the
notion of a mapping which transforms infinitesimal circles into infinitesimal
ellipses, studying parameters such as the ratio of the major to the minor axes
of such an infinitesimal ellipse, its area divided by the area of the
infinitesimal circle of which it is the image, and the inclination of its axis
with respect to a fixed axis in the plane. We also give some information about
the lives and works of Gr\""otzsch, Lavrentieff, Ahlfors and Teichm\""uller. The
latter brought the theory of quasiconformal mappings to a high level of
development. He used it in an essential way in his investigations of Riemann
surfaces and their moduli and in function theory (in particular, in his work on
the Bieberbach conjecture and the type problem). We survey in detail several of
his results. We also discuss some aspects of his life and writings, explaining
why his papers were not read and why some of his ideas are still unknown even
to Teichm\""uller theorists. The final version of this paper will appear in the

QCD Green's functions is a generally accepted fact. Recently, a new approach
was proposed for the study of duality violations (DVs), which exploits the
existence of a rigorous lower bound on the functional distance, measured in a
certain norm, between a ""true"" correlator and its approximant calculated
theoretically along a contour in the complex energy plane. In the present paper
we pursue the investigation of functional-analysis based tests towards their
application to real spectral function data. We derive a closed analytic
expression for the minimal functional distance based on the general weighted
$L^2$ norm and discuss its relation with the distance measured in $L^\infty$
norm. Using fake data sets obtained from a realistic toy model in which we
allow for covariances inspired from the publicly available ALEPH spectral
functions, we obtain by Monte Carlo simulations the statistical distribution of
the strength parameter that measures the magnitude of the DV term added to the
usual operator product expansion (OPE). The results show that, if the region
with large errors near the end-point of the spectrum in $\tau$ decays is
excluded, the functional-analysis based tests using either $L^2$ or $L^\infty$
norms are able to detect, in a statistically significant way, the presence of
DVs in realistic spectral function pseudodata.

that a purely Markovian integrate-and-fire (IF) model, with a noisy slow
adaptation term, can generate interspike intervals (ISIs) that appear as having
LRD. However a proper analysis shows that this is not the case asymptotically.
For comparison, we also consider a new model of individual IF neuron with
fractional (non-Markovian) noise. The correlations of its spike trains are
studied and proven to have LRD, unlike classical IF models. On the other hand,
to correctly measure long-range dependence, it is usually necessary to know if
the data are stationary. Thus, a methodology to evaluate stationarity of the
ISIs is presented and applied to the various IF models. We explain that
Markovian IF models may seem to have LRD because of non-stationarities.

quanta, where the formation of nearby dark-state polaritons is blocked by the
strong interactions between Rydberg atoms. This blockade mechanism, however,
realizes an inherently dissipative nonlinearity, which limits the performance
of practical applications. In this work, we propose a new approach to strong
photon interactions via a largely coherent mechanism at drastically suppressed
photon losses. Rather than a polariton blockade, it is based on an interaction
induced conversion between distinct types of dark-state polaritons with
different propagation characteristics. We outline a specific implementation of
this approach and show that it permits to turn a single photon into an
effective mirror with a robust and continuously tuneable reflection phase. We
describe potential applications, including a detailed discussion of achievable
operational fidelities.

insight in the large strain properties of otherwise brittle acrylic well
crosslinked networks. The networks have been prepared by sequences of
polymerization and swelling with monomers. The parameters that have been varied
are the nature of the base monomers and the degree of crosslinking of the first

strain properties in uniaxial tension are characterized. It is shown here that
the large strain properties of the multiple networks are quantitatively
controlled by the large strain properties of the stretched first network which
acts as a percolating filler, while the small and intermediate properties are
controlled by the entanglement density which can be largely superior to that of
homogeneous networks. Different brittle and prestretched elastomer networks are
embedded at a low volume fraction in a soft extensible matrix. The increase in
toughness of the final material is directly controlled by the nonlinear elastic
properties of the prestretched network and its volume fraction, providing a

efficient, giving picosecond cooling times, for hexagonal BN, where the
high-momentum hyperbolic phonon polaritons enable efficient near-field energy
transfer. We study this heat transfer mechanism through distinct control knobs

power grids and include, but are not limited to, electricity theft and faulty
meters. In emerging countries, they may range up to 40% of the total
electricity distributed. In order to detect NTLs, machine learning methods are
used that learn irregular consumption patterns from customer data and
inspection results. The Big Data paradigm followed in modern machine learning
reflects the desire of deriving better conclusions from simply analyzing more
data, without the necessity of looking at theory and models. However, the
sample of inspected customers may be biased, i.e. it does not represent the
population of all customers. As a consequence, machine learning models trained
on these inspection results are biased as well and therefore lead to unreliable
predictions of whether customers cause NTL or not. In machine learning, this
issue is called covariate shift and has not been addressed in the literature on
NTL detection yet. In this work, we present a novel framework for quantifying
and visualizing covariate shift. We apply it to a commercial data set from
Brazil that consists of 3.6M customers and 820K inspection results. We show
that some features have a stronger covariate shift than others, making
predictions less reliable. In particular, previous inspections were focused on
certain neighborhoods or customer classes and that they were not sufficiently
spread among the population of customers. This framework is about to be
deployed in a commercial product for NTL detection.

singular structure: a multicharged axial OV splits into the set of

The OV positions in the beam cross section depend on the propagation distance
as well as on the edge position with respect to the incident beam axis, and the
OV cores describe regular trajectories when one or both of these parameters
change. However, the trajectories are not always continuous; they may be
accompanied with topological reactions, including emergence of new
singularities, their interaction and annihilation. Based on the
Kirchhoff-Fresnel integral, we consider the singular skeleton behavior in
diffracted Kummer beams and Laguerre-Gaussian beams with topological charge
|m|=2 and 3. We reveal the nature of the trajectories' discontinuities and
other topological events in the singular skeleton evolution that appear to be
highly sensitive to the incident beam properties and to the diffraction
conditions. Conditions at which the OV trajectory becomes discontinuous and
mechanisms by which this is realized are discussed. The conclusions based on
the numerical calculations are supported by the asymptotic analytical model of
the OV beam diffraction. The results can be useful in the OV metrology and for
the OV beam's diagnostics.

computation of all embedded element patterns is sped up with the help of the

the presence of haze in Pluto's atmosphere that were formed by CH4/N2
photochemistry at high altitudes in Pluto's atmosphere, as on Titan and Triton.
In order to help the analysis of the observations and further investigate the
formation of organic haze and its evolution at global scales, we have
implemented a simple parametrization of the formation of organic haze in our
Pluto General Circulation Model. The production of haze in our model is based
on the different steps of aerosol formation as understood on Titan and Triton:
photolysis of CH4 in the upper atmosphere by Lyman-alpha UV radiation,
production of various gaseous species, and conversion into solid particles
through accumulation and aggregation processes. We compared two reference
simulations ran with a particle radius of 50 nm: with, and without South Pole
N2 condensation. We discuss the impact of the particle radius and the lifetime
of the precursors on the haze distribution. We simulate CH4 photolysis and the
haze formation up to 600 km above the surface. Results show that CH4 photolysis
in Pluto's atmosphere in 2015 occured mostly in the sunlit summer hemisphere
with a peak at an altitude of 250 km, though the interplanetary source of
Lyman-alpha flux can induce some photolysis even in the Winter hemisphere. We
obtained an extensive haze up to altitudes comparable with the observations,
and with non-negligible densities up to 500 km altitude. In both reference
simulations, the haze density is not strongly impacted by the meridional
circulation. With no South Pole N2 condensation, the maximum nadir opacity and
haze extent is obtained at the North Pole. With South Pole N2 condensation, the
descending parcel of air above the South Pole leads to a latitudinally more
homogeneous haze density with a slight density peak at the South Pole.

unusual and elusive superconducting state of fundamental importance. In the
last three decades Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been very carefully studied and despite
its apparent simplicity when compared with strongly correlated high-$T_{c}$
cuprates, for which the pairing symmetry is understood, there is no scenario
that can explain all the major experimental observations, a conundrum that has
generated tremendous interest. Here we present a density-functional based
analysis of magnetic interactions in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and discuss the role of
magnetic anisotropy in its unconventional superconductivity. Our goal is
twofold. First, we access the possibility of the superconducting order
parameter rotation in an external magnetic field of 200 Oe, and conclude that
the spin-orbit interaction in this material is several orders of magnitude too
strong to be consistent with this hypothesis. Thus, the observed invariance of
the Knight shift across $T_{c}$ has no plausible explanation, and casts doubt
on using the Knight shift as an ultimate litmus paper for the pairing symmetry.
Second, we propose a quantitative double-exchange-like model for combining
itinerant fermions with an anisotropic Heisenberg magnetic Hamiltonian. This
model is complementary to the Hubbard-model-based calculations published so
far, and forms an alternative framework for exploring superconducting symmetry
in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}.$ As an example, we use this model to analyze the
degeneracy between various $p-$triplet states in the simplest mean-field
approximation, and show that it splits into a single and two doublets with the
ground state defined by the competition between the ""Ising"" and ""compass""
anisotropic terms.

system gained from the analysis of 350 hr of 4.5 micron observations with the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The observations show no sign of orbit-to-orbit
variability nor of orbital evolution of the eccentric planetary companion,
HAT-P-2 b. The extensive coverage allows us to better differentiate
instrumental systematics from the transient heating of HAT-P-2 b's 4.5 micron
photosphere and yields the detection of stellar pulsations with an amplitude of
approximately 40 ppm. These pulsation modes correspond to exact harmonics of
the planet's orbital frequency, indicative of a tidal origin. Transient tidal
effects can excite pulsation modes in the envelope of a star, but, to date,
such pulsations had only been detected in highly eccentric stellar binaries.
Current stellar models are unable to reproduce HAT-P-2's pulsations, suggesting
that our understanding of the interactions at play in this system is
incomplete.

x 10^(-9) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) (in 0.1 - 120 keV range). The broadband spectrum,
typical for accreting pulsars, is well described by a cutoff power law with a
cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at ~ 38 keV. This value is
consistent with earlier reports based on the observations with Suzaku at factor
of ten lower luminosity, which implies that the feature is formed close to the
neutron star surface rather than in the accretion column. Pulsations with P ~
15.82 s were observed up to ~ 70 keV. The pulse profile strongly depends on
energy and is characterised by a ""soft"" and a ""hard"" peaks shifted by half
period, which suggests a strong phase dependence of the spectrum, and that two
components with roughly orthogonal beam patterns are responsible for the
observed pulse shape. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the CRSF,
despite its relatively high energy, is only detected in the spectrum of the
soft peak of the pulse profile. Along with the absence of correlation of the
line energy with luminosity, this could be explained in the framework of the
recently proposed ""reflection"" model for CRSF formation. However more detailed
modelling of both line and continuum formation are required to confirm this
interpretation.

functions on $\mathfrak{V}$ --- denoted $H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ --- as the
multiplier algebra $\operatorname{Mult} \mathcal{H}_{\mathfrak{V}}$ of a

consisting of nc functions on $\mathfrak{V}$. We find that every such algebra
$H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ is completely isometrically isomorphic to the quotient
$H^\infty(\mathfrak{B}_d)/ \mathcal{J}_{\mathfrak{V}}$ of the algebra of
bounded nc holomorphic functions on the ball by the ideal
$\mathcal{J}_{\mathfrak{V}}$ of bounded nc holomorphic functions which vanish
on $\mathfrak{V}$.
  We investigate the problem of when two algebras $H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ and
$H^\infty(\mathfrak{W})$ are isometrically isomorphic. If the variety
$\mathfrak{W}$ is the image of $\mathfrak{V}$ under a nc analytic automorphism
of $\mathfrak{B}_d$, then $H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ and $H^\infty(\mathfrak{W})$
are (completely) isometrically isometric. We prove that the converse holds in
the case where the varieties are homogeneous; in general we can only show that
if the algebras are isometrically isomorphic, then there must be nc holomorphic
maps between the varieties.
  Along the way we are led to consider some interesting problems on function
theory in the nc unit ball. For example, we study various versions of the
Nullstellensatz (that is, the problem of to what extent an ideal is determined
by its zero set), and we obtain perfect Nullstellensatz in both the homogeneous
as well as the commutative cases. We also consider similar problems regarding
the bounded analytic functions that extend continuously to the boundary of
$\mathfrak{B}_d$.

positive number $\lambda$, we consider, among all ellipsoids $E \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ of volume $\lambda$, those that best approximate $K$ with respect
to the symmetric difference metric, or equivalently that maximize the volume of
$E\cap K$: these are the maximal intersection (MI) ellipsoids introduced by
Artstein-Avidan and Katzin. The question of uniqueness of MI ellipsoids (under
the obviously necessary assumption that $\lambda$ is between the volumes of the
John and the Loewner ellipsoids of $K$) is open in general. We provide a
positive answer to this question in dimension $d=2$. Therefore we obtain a
continuous $1$-parameter family of ellipses interpolating between the John and
the Loewner ellipses of $K$. In order to prove uniqueness, we show that the
area $I_K(E)$ of the intersection $K \cap E$ is a strictly quasiconcave
function of the ellipse $E$, with respect to the natural affine structure on
the set of ellipses of area $\lambda$. The proof relies on smoothening $K$,
putting it in general position, and obtaining uniform estimates for certain
derivatives of the function $I_K(.)$. Finally, we provide a characterization of
maximal intersection positions, that is, the situation where the MI ellipse of
$K$ is the unit disk, under the assumption that the two boundaries are
transverse.

$H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\varepsilon$. When $\varepsilon\geq0$, the eigenvalues of this
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are discrete, real, and positive. This portion of
parameter space is known as the region of unbroken PT symmetry. In the region
of broken PT symmetry $\varepsilon<0$ only a finite number of eigenvalues are
real and the remaining eigenvalues appear as complex-conjugate pairs. The
region of unbroken PT symmetry has been studied but the region of broken PT

and analytical examination of the behavior of the eigenvalues for
$-4<\varepsilon<0$. In particular, it reports the discovery of an
infinite-order exceptional point at $\varepsilon=-1$, a transition from a
discrete spectrum to a partially continuous spectrum at $\varepsilon=-2$, a
transition at the Coulomb value $\varepsilon=-3$, and the behavior of the
eigenvalues as $\varepsilon$ approaches the conformal limit $\varepsilon=-4$.

the reservoir performance is improved by increasing the size of the CA

The experiments performed on quasi-uniform CA reservoir provide valuable

this work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model

our model first encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two
encoded sentences in two directions $P \rightarrow Q$ and $P \leftarrow Q$. In
each matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all
time-steps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another
BiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a fix-length
matching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, the decision is made
through a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks:
paraphrase identification, natural language inference and answer sentence
selection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our

(solar cycles 15-24). The seasonal variation in the relation between monthly
$\Delta{H}$ and solar wind speed is taken into account by calculating separate
regressions between $\Delta{H}$ and SW speed for each month. Thereby, we obtain
a homogeneous series of proxy values for monthly solar wind speed for the last
100 years. We find that the strongest HSS-active months of each solar cycle
occur in the declining phase, in years 1919, 1930, 1941, 1952, 1959, 1973,
1982, 1994 and 2003. Practically all these years are the same or adjacent to
the years of annual maximum solar wind speeds. This implies that the most
persistent coronal holes, lasting for several solar rotations and leading to
the highest annual SW speeds, are also the sources of the highest monthly SW
speeds. Accordingly, during the last 100 years, there were no coronal holes of
short duration (of about one solar rotation) that would produce faster monthly
(or solar rotation) averaged solar wind than the most long-living coronal holes
in each solar cycle produce.

known to date, are crucial for the studies of the growth of supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) and the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at early
cosmological epochs. Radio jets offer direct evidence of SMBHs, and their radio
structures can be studied with the highest angular resolution using Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Here we report on the observations of three
HRQs (J0131-0321, J0906+6930, J1026+2542) at z>5 using the Korean VLBI Network
and VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry Arrays (together known as KaVA) with
the purpose of studying their pc-scale jet properties. The observations were
carried out at 22 and 43 GHz in 2016 January among the first-batch open-use
experiments of KaVA. The quasar J0906+6930 was detected at 22 GHz but not at 43
GHz. The other two sources were not detected and upper limits to their compact
radio emission are given. Archival VLBI imaging data and single-dish 15-GHz
monitoring light curve of J0906+6930 were also acquired as complementary
information. J0906+6930 shows a moderate-level variability at 15 GHz. The radio
image is characterized by a core-jet structure with a total detectable size of
~5 pc in projection. The brightness temperature, 1.9x10^{11} K, indicates
relativistic beaming of the jet. The radio properties of J0906+6930 are
consistent with a blazar. Follow-up VLBI observations will be helpful for
determining its structural variation.

people who self-organized around a common purpose, emotion or experience.
Today, however, firms often refer to crowds in discussions of how collections
of individuals can be engaged for organizational purposes. Crowdsourcing, the
use of information technologies to outsource business responsibilities to
crowds, can now significantly influence a firms ability to leverage previously
unattainable resources to build competitive advantage. Nonetheless, many
managers are hesitant to consider crowdsourcing because they do not understand
how its various types can add value to the firm. In response, we explain what
crowdsourcing is, the advantages it offers and how firms can pursue
crowdsourcing. We begin by formulating a crowdsourcing typology and show how
its four categories (crowd-voting, micro-task, idea and solution crowdsourcing)
can help firms develop crowd capital, an organizational-level resource
harnessed from the crowd. We then present a three-step process model for
generating crowd capital. Step one includes important considerations that shape
how a crowd is to be constructed. Step two outlines the capabilities firms need
to develop to acquire and assimilate resources (knowledge, labor, funds) from
the crowd. Step three addresses key decision-areas that executives need to
address to effectively engage crowds.

used thermal radiation from ohmically heated conductors, some noble metals
exhibit ""cold"" electroluminescence (EL) in percolation films, tunnel diodes,

spectrally broad and depends on applied bias, is controversial given the low
radiative yields of electronic transitions. Nanoparticle EL is particularly
intriguing since it involves localized surface-plasmon resonances with large
dipole moments. Such plasmons enable very efficient non-radiative fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) coupling to proximal resonant dipole
transitions. We demonstrate nanoscopic FRET-LEDs which exploit the opposite
process, energy transfer from silver nanoparticles to exfoliated monolayers of
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In diffraction-limited hotspots
showing pronounced photon bunching, broadband silver EL is focused into the
narrow excitonic resonance of the atomically thin overlayer. Such devices may
offer alternatives to conventional nano-LEDs in on-chip optical interconnects.

mass-varying neutrinos. When massive neutrinos become nonrelativistic, the
$Z_2$ symmetry breaks, and the quintessence potential becomes positive from its
initially zero value. This positive potential behaves like a cosmological
constant at the present era and drives the Universe's acceleration during the
slow roll evolution of the quintessence. In contrast to $\Lambda$CDM model, the
dark energy in our model is dynamical, and the acceleration is not persistent.
Contrary to some of the previous models of dark energy with mass-varying
neutrinos, we do not use the adiabaticity condition which leads to instability.

reservoir is analyzed using a number of metrics, such as kernel quality,

a deterministic design. A novel re-seeding method is introduced to reduce the
adverse effects of stochastic noise, which may also be implemented in other

Benchmark results indicate that the proposed design performs well on
