constraining the internal degrees of freedom of Dirac bi-spinor structures
driven by arbitrary Poincar\'{e} invariant potentials is proposed. Given that
the Dirac equation dynamics including external potentials can be simulated by a
suitable four level trapped ion setup, quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic
states with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its
projection onto the direction of the external magnetic field (used for lift the
ions degeneracy), are recovered by means of a suitable ansatz. This formalism
allows the inclusion of noise effects, which leads to disentanglement in the
four level trapped ion quantum system. Our results indicate the role of
interactions in bi-spinor entanglement, as well as the description of
disentanglement in ionic states under local noises. For a state prepared
initially in one of the ionic levels, local noise induces entanglement sudden
death followed by sudden revivals driven by the noiseless dynamics of the
state. Residual quantum correlations are observed in the intervals where such
state is separable. Schr\""odinger cat and Werner states partially loose their
initial entanglement content due to the interaction with the noisy environment
but presenting entanglement oscillations without sudden death. Because Dirac
equation describes low energy excitations of mono layer and bi-layer graphene,
the formalism can also be applied to compute, for instance, electron-hole or
electron/electron entanglement in various circumstances.

convergence to global minimizers for sufficiently regular non-convex objectives

As in the asymptotic setting, our analysis relates the discrete-time SGLD

the CO(2-1), CO(7-6) and [CI] 369 micron lines in the same source obtained at
the VLA and PdBI. We find a [CII] line flux of F_[CII]=1.11+/-0.10 Jy km/s and
a continuum flux density of S_227GHz=0.53+/-0.04 mJy/beam, consistent with
previous unresolved measurements. No other source is detected in continuum or
[CII] emission in the field covered by ALMA (~25""). At the resolution of our
ALMA observations (0.23"", or 1.2 kpc, a factor ~70 smaller beam area compared
to previous measurements), we find that the majority of the emission is very
compact: a high fraction (~80%) of the total line and continuum flux is
associated with a region 1-1.5 kpc in diameter. The remaining ~20% of the
emission is distributed over a larger area with radius <4 kpc. The [CII]
emission does not exhibit ordered motion on kpc-scales: applying the virial
theorem yields an upper limit on the dynamical mass of the host galaxy of
(4.3+/-0.9)x10^10 M_sun, only ~20x higher than the central black hole. The
other targeted lines (CO(2-1), CO(7-6) and [CI]) are not detected, but the
limits of the line ratios with respect to the [CII] emission imply that the
heating in the quasar host is dominated by star formation, and not by the
accreting black hole. The star-formation rate implied by the FIR continuum is
105-340 M_sun/yr, with a resulting star-formation rate surface density of
~100-350 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, well below the value for Eddington-accretion-limited
star formation.

polarization orientations in the three wavelength-bands, suggesting that, at
the considered common angular resolution of 3.0 arcminutes that corresponds to
a physical scale of approximately 0.61 pc, the inferred magnetic field
orientation is not significantly affected by temperature or dust grain
alignment effects. Second, we find that the relative orientation between gas
column density structures and the magnetic field changes progressively with
increasing gas column density, from mostly parallel or having no preferred
orientation at low column densities to mostly perpendicular at the highest
column densities. This observation is in agreement with previous studies by the
Planck collaboration towards more nearby molecular clouds. Finally, we find a
correspondence between the trends in relative orientation and the shape of the
column density probability distribution functions. In the sub-regions of Vela C
dominated by one clear filamentary structure, or ""ridges"", we find a sharp
transition from preferentially parallel or having no preferred relative
orientation at low column densities to preferentially perpendicular at highest
column densities. In the sub-regions of Vela C dominated by several filamentary
structures with multiple orientations, or ""nests"", such a transition is also
present, but it is clearly less sharp than in the ridge-like sub-regions. Both
of these results suggest that the magnetic field is dynamically important for
the formation of density structures in this region.

accuracy of various speech and image recognition systems. In this paper we show
how to adapt some of these techniques to create a novel chained convolutional
architecture with next-step conditioning for improving performance on protein
sequence prediction problems. We explore its value by demonstrating its ability
to improve performance on eight-class secondary structure prediction. We first
establish a state-of-the-art baseline by adapting recent advances in
convolutional neural networks which were developed for vision tasks. This model
achieves 70.0% per amino acid accuracy on the CB513 benchmark dataset without
use of standard performance-boosting techniques such as ensembling or multitask
learning. We then improve upon this state-of-the-art result using a novel
chained prediction approach which frames the secondary structure prediction as
a next-step prediction problem. This sequential model achieves 70.3% Q8
accuracy on CB513 with a single model; an ensemble of these models produces
71.4% Q8 accuracy on the same test set, improving upon the previous overall
state of the art for the eight-class secondary structure problem. Our models
are implemented using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning software
library available at TensorFlow.org; we aim to release the code for these

several independent sources, each distributing a physical system to a subset of

on initially independent systems, which may lead to strong correlations across
the whole network. In this work, we introduce a technique to systematically map
a Bell inequality to a family of Bell-type inequalities bounding classical
correlations on networks in a star-configuration. Also, we show that whenever a
given Bell inequality can be violated by some entangled state $\rho$, then all
the corresponding network inequalities can be violated by considering many
copies of $\rho$ distributed in the star network. The relevance of these ideas
is illustrated by applying our method to a specific multi-setting Bell
inequality. We derive the corresponding network inequalities, and study their
quantum violations.

similar Langevin simulations. Inclusion of hydrodynamic modes speeds up the
ejection but also allows the part of the polymer outside the capsid to expand
closer to equilibrium. This shows as higher values of radius of gyration when
hydrodynamics are enabled. By examining the waiting times of individual polymer
beads we find that the waiting time $t_w$ grows with the number of ejected
monomers $s$ as a sum of two exponents. When $\approx 63 \%$ of the polymer has
ejected the ejection enters the regime of slower dynamics. The functional form
of $t_w$ vs $s$ is universal for all ejection processes starting from the same
initial monomer densities. Inclusion of hydrodynamics only reduces its
magnitude. Consequently, we define a universal scaling function $h$ such that
the cumulative waiting time $t = N_0 h(s/N_0)$ for large $N_0$. Our
unprecedently precise measurements of force indicate that this form for
$t_w(s)$ originates from the corresponding force towards the pore decreasing
super exponentially at the end of the ejection. Our measured $t_w(s)$ explains
the apparent superlinear scaling of the ejection time with the polymer length

Cyber-Relationship Addiction, Information Overload, and Net Compulsion, have
been recently noted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed
passively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention. In this paper, we
argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively
identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the
mental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria (questionnaire)
cannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and
innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing
of those mental factors via questionnaires. Instead, we propose a machine
learning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD),
that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately
identify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in
SNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the
performance. Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3126 online
social network users. We conduct a feature analysis, and also apply SNMDD on
large-scale datasets and analyze the characteristics of the three SNMD types.
The results show that SNMDD is promising for identifying online social network
users with potential SNMDs.

dynamic system cost function composed of time-variant local costs of subsystems
and a shared time-variant cost of the whole system is minimized. A dynamic
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to track the
varying optimal points of the dynamic optimization problem in an online manner.
We analyze the convergence properties of the dynamic ADMM and show that, under
several standard technical assumptions, the iterations of the dynamic ADMM
converge linearly to some neighborhoods of the time-varying optimal points. The
sizes of these neighborhoods depend on the drifts of the dynamic objective
functions: the more drastically the dynamic objective function evolves across
time, the larger the sizes of these neighborhoods. We also investigate the
impact of the drifts on the steady state convergence behaviors of the dynamic
ADMM. Finally, two numerical examples, namely a dynamic sharing problem and the
dynamic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), are presented
to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic ADMM. It is observed
that the dynamic ADMM can track the time-varying optimal points quickly and
accurately. For the dynamic LASSO, the dynamic ADMM has competitive performance
compared to the benchmark offline optimizor while the former possesses
significant computational advantage over the latter.

linearize full relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations and solve them
numerically. We find the dispersion relation of the pinch and kink mode
instabilities. By comparing the dispersion relations of mildly relativistic jet
(Lorentz factor 2) with moderately relativistic jet (Lorentz factor 10), we
find that the jet with higher Lorentz factor is significantly more stable in
both pinch and kink modes. We show that inclusion of the current sheet-free
magnetic field in the jet further enhances the stability. Both pinch and kink
mode instabilities become progressively more stable with increasing
magnetization. We also show a scaling relation between the maximum temporal
growth rate of the unstable mode and the Lorentz factor of the jet. The maximum
temporal growth rates of the unstable modes are inversely proportion to the
Lorentz factors for most of the modes that we study. However, for the
fundamental pinch mode it is inversely proportional to the square of the
Lorentz factor. This very beneficial scaling relation holds regardless of the

or a planet is currently the main challenge in radial velocity searches for
low-mass exoplanets. Even when the presence of a transiting planet and hence
its period are known, stellar activity can be the main barrier to measuring the
correct amplitude of the radial velocity signal. Several tools are being used
to help understand which signals come from stellar activity in the data. Aims.
We aim to present a new tool that can be used for the purpose of identifying
periodicities caused by stellar activity, and show how it can be used to track
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detection over time. The tool is based
on the principle that stellar activity signals are variable and incoherent.
Methods. We calculate the Bayesian general Lomb-Scargle periodogram for subsets
of data and by adding one extra data point we track what happens to the
presence and significance of periodicities in the data. Publicly available
datasets from HARPS and HARPS-N were used for this purpose. Additionally, we
analysed a synthetic dataset that we created with SOAP2.0 to simulate pure
stellar activity and a mixture of stellar activity and a planet. Results. We
find that this tool can easily be used to identify unstable and incoherent
signals, such as those introduced by stellar activity. The SNR of the detection
grows approximately as the square root of the number of data points, in the
case of a stable signal. This can then be used to make decisions on whether it
is useful to keep observing a specific object. The tool is relatively fast and
easy to use, and thus lends itself perfectly to a quick analysis of the data.

decisions among multiple base stations in an LTE-Advanced downlink network in
order to manage inter-cell interference with a centralized controller. To solve
the coordinated scheduling problem an integer non-linear program is formulated
that, unlike most existing approaches, does not rely on exact channel state
information but only makes use of the specific measurement reports defined in
the 3GPP standard. An equivalent integer linear reformulation of the
coordinated scheduling problem is proposed, which can be efficiently solved by
commercial solvers. Extensive simulations of medium to large-size networks are
carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed coordinated scheduling
approaches, confirming available analytical results reporting fundamental
limitations in the cooperation due to out-of-cluster interference.
Nevertheless, the schemes proposed in this paper show important gains in
average user throughput of the cell-edge users, especially in the case of
heterogeneous networks.

  Markov Chain Monte Carlo",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) is a convenient way to
obtain approximations to the posterior marginals for parameters in Bayesian
hierarchical models when the latent effects can be expressed as a Gaussian
Markov Random Field (GMRF). In addition, its implementation in the R-INLA
package for the R statistical software provides an easy way to fit models using
INLA in practice. R-INLA implements a number of widely used latent models,
including several spatial models. In addition, R-INLA can fit models in a
fraction of the time than other computer intensive methods (e.g. Markov Chain
Monte Carlo) take to fit the same model.
  Although INLA provides a fast approximation to the marginals of the model
parameters, it is difficult to use it with models not implemented in R-INLA. It
is also difficult to make multivariate posterior inference on the parameters of
the model as INLA focuses on the posterior marginals and not the joint
posterior distribution.
  In this paper we describe how to use INLA within the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm to fit spatial models and estimate the joint posterior distribution
of a reduced number of parameters. We will illustrate the benefits of this new
method with two examples on spatial econometrics and disease mapping where
complex spatial models with several spatial structures need to be fitted.

Herbig-Haro jet, HH 1019, located near the Tr 14 cluster in the Carina Nebula.
Like other HH jets in the region, this bipolar collimated flow emerges from the
head of a dark dust pillar. However, HH 1019 is unique because -- unlike all
other HH jets known to date -- it is identified by a linear chain of dark,
dusty knots that are seen primarily in silhouette against the background screen
of the H II region. Proper motions confirm that these dark condensations move
along the jet axis at high speed. [S II] emission traces a highly collimated
jet that is spatially coincident with these dust knots. The high extinction in
the body of the jet suggests that this outflow has lifted a large amount of
dust directly from the disk, although it is possible that it has entrained dust
from its surrounding protostellar envelope before exiting the dust pillar. If
dust in HH 1019 originates from the circumstellar disk, this provides further
evidence for a jet launched from a range of radii in the disk, including those
outside the dust sublimation radius. HH 1019 may be the prototype for a new
subclass of dusty HH objects seen primarily in extinction against the
background screen of a bright H II region. Such jets may be common, but
difficult to observe because they require the special condition of a very
bright background in order to be seen in silhouette.

induced in the SrTiO$_3$ part of the superlattice. Moreover, the La-Sr
distances and Ni-O out-of-plane bond lengths at the interfaces exhibit a
distinct variation by about $7\,\%$ with the sign of the electrostatic doping.
In contrast to the much studied LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system, the charge mismatch
at the interfaces is exclusively accommodated within the LaNiO$_3$ layers,
whereas the interface polarity leads to a band offset and to the formation of
an electric field within the coupled superlattice. Features of the electronic
structure indicate an orbital-selective quantization of quantum well states.
The potential- and confinement-induced multiband splitting results in complex
cylindrical Fermi surfaces with a tendency towards nesting that depends on the
interface polarity. The analysis of the thermoelectric response reveals a
particularly large positive Seebeck coefficient ($135~\mu$V/K) and a high
figure of merit ($0.35$) for room-temperature cross-plane transport in the
$p$-type superlattice that is attributed to the participation of the SrTiO$_3$
valence band. Superlattices with either $n$- or $p$-type interfaces show
cross-plane Seebeck coefficients of opposite sign and thus emerge as a platform

derivation of a quantum master equation capable of describing arbitrary
confined nonrelativistic matter systems in an open quantum gravitational
environment. It enables us to relate the spectral function for gravitational
waves and the distribution function for quantum gravitational fluctuations and
to indeed introduce a new spectral function for the zero-point fluctuations of
spacetime. The formulation is applied to two-level identical bosonic atoms in
an off-resonant high-$Q$ cavity that effectively inhibits undesirable
electromagnetic delays, leading to a gravitational transition mechanism through
certain quadrupole moment operators. The overall relaxation rate before
reaching equilibrium is found to generally scale collectively with the number
$N$ of atoms. However, we are also able to identify certain states of which the
decay and excitation rates with stochastic gravitational waves and vacuum
spacetime fluctuations amplify more significantly with a factor of $N^2$. Using
such favourable states as a means of measuring both conventional stochastic
gravitational waves and novel zero-point spacetime fluctuations, we determine
the theoretical lower bounds for the respective spectral functions. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our findings on future observations of
gravitational waves of a wider spectral window than currently accessible.
Especially, the possible sensing of the zero-point fluctuations of spacetime

sensor nodes scattered in a geographical area and one or multiple sink(s)
collecting information. The special design and character of sensors and their
applications make WSNs different from traditional networks. These
characteristics pose great challenges for architecture and protocol design,
performance modeling, and implementation. Accurately modeling the data
generated by each sensor node is essential for correctly simulating network
traffic, network congestion, interference between nodes and the energy expended
by each node. Successful design leads to enhancing the overall performance of
the whole of network. In this paper we analyze the performance of WSN with
N-BURST traffic model. The impact of bursty traffic on the mean packet delay
and buffer overflow probability is investigated analytically. We study the
effects of bursty WSN traffic through simulations with three different cases.
Both short-range dependency (SRD) traffic and long range dependency (LRD)
traffic are simulated over different burst parameters. Finally we study the
effect of pareto OFF time through simulation. The results are collected for 10
different 24 hour simulated periods in order to study and measure day-today
statistical fluctuation.

  Work","A convex formulation of traffic dynamics on transportation networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article proposes a numerical scheme for computing the evolution of
vehicular traffic on a road network over a finite time horizon. The traffic
dynamics on each link is modeled by the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial
differential equation (PDE), which is an equivalent form of the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards PDE. The main contribution of this article is the
construction of a single convex optimization program which computes the traffic
flow at a junction over a finite time horizon and decouples the PDEs on
connecting links. Compared to discretization schemes which require the
computation of all traffic states on a time-space grid, the proposed convex
optimization approach computes the boundary flows at the junction using only
the initial condition on links and the boundary conditions of the network. The
computed boundary flows at the junction specify the boundary condition for the
HJ PDE on connecting links, which then can be separately solved using an
existing semi-explicit scheme for single link HJ PDE. As demonstrated in a
numerical example of ramp metering control, the proposed convex optimization
approach also provides a natural framework for optimal traffic control
applications.

ends that are coupled to a current lead on one side and to a quantum dot (QD)

the conductance and the zero-frequency noise. Using an effective low-energy
model, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability as a function of
the various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano resonance (FR)
line shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy
level when the two MBS overlap. The asymmetry parameter changes sign as the
bias voltage is tuned through the MBS overlap energy. The FR is mirrored as a
function of the QD level energy as long as tunneling to the more distant MBS is
negligible. However, if both MBS are coupled to the lead and the QD, the height
as well as the asymmetry of the line shapes cease to respect this symmetry.
These two exclusive cases uniquely distinguish the coupling to a MBS from the
coupling to a fermionic bound state that is shared between the two MBS. We
complement the analysis by employing a discretized one-dimensional p-wave
superconductor (Kitaev chain) for the quantum wire and show that the features

affecting cosmological constraints from weak gravitational lensing. Obtaining
numerical predictions from hydrodynamical simulations of expected survey
volumes is expensive, and a cheaper alternative relies on populating large dark
matter-only simulations with accurate models of alignments calibrated on
smaller hydrodynamical runs. This requires connecting the shapes and
orientations of galaxies to those of dark matter haloes and to the large-scale
structure. In this paper, we characterise galaxy-halo alignments in the
Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We compare the shapes and
orientations of galaxies in the redshift range $0<z<3$ to those of their
embedding dark matter haloes, and to the matching haloes of a twin dark-matter
only run with identical initial conditions. We find that galaxy ellipticities
in general cannot be predicted directly from halo ellipticities. The mean
misalignment angle between the minor axis of a galaxy and its embedding halo is
a function of halo mass, with residuals arising from the dependence of
alignment on galaxy type, but not on environment. Haloes are much more strongly
aligned among themselves than galaxies, and they decrease their alignment
towards low redshift. Galaxy alignments compete with this effect, as galaxies
tend to increase their alignment with haloes towards low redshift. We discuss
the implications of these results for current halo models of intrinsic
alignments and suggest several avenues for improvement.

transiting bright stars, $4 < m_V < 8$, by monitoring the full sky. MASCARA
consists of one northern station on La Palma, Canary Islands (fully operational
since February 2015), one southern station at La Silla Observatory, Chile
(operational from early 2017), and a data centre at Leiden Observatory in the
Netherlands. Both MASCARA stations are equipped with five interline CCD cameras
using wide field lenses (24 mm focal length) with fixed pointings, which
together provide coverage down to airmass 3 of the local sky. The interline CCD
cameras allow for back-to-back exposures, taken at fixed sidereal times with
exposure times of 6.4 sidereal seconds. The exposures are short enough that the
motion of stars across the CCD does not exceed one pixel during an integration.
Astrometry and photometry are performed on-site, after which the resulting
light curves are transferred to Leiden for further analysis. The final MASCARA
archive will contain light curves for ${\sim}70,000$ stars down to $m_V=8.4$,
with a precision of $1.5\%$ per 5 minutes at $m_V=8$.

motivate the need for a greater focus on quasiperiodic models in theoretical

greatly increase the statistical precision of our clustering measurements by
using the cross-correlation of 66,657 spectroscopic galaxies to a sample of 6.6
million fainter photometric galaxies. The clustering amplitude $w(R)$ is
measured as the ratio of the mean excess number of photometric galaxies found
within a specified radius annulus around a spectroscopic galaxy to that from a
random photometric galaxy distribution. We recover many of the familiar trends
at high signal-to-noise ratio. We find the ratio of the clustering amplitudes
of red and blue massive galaxies to be $w_\text{red}/w_\text{blue} = 1.92 \pm
0.11$ in our smallest annulus of 75-125 kpc. At our largest radii (2-4 Mpc), we
find $w_\text{red}/w_\text{blue} = 1.24 \pm 0.05$. Red galaxies therefore have
denser environments than their blue counterparts at $z \sim 0.625$, and this
effect increases with decreasing radius. Irrespective of color, we find that
$w(R)$ does not obey a simple power-law relation with radius, showing a dip
around 1 Mpc. Holding stellar mass fixed, we find a clear differentiation
between clustering in red and blue galaxies, showing that clustering is not
solely determined by stellar mass. Holding color fixed, we find that clustering
increases with stellar mass, especially for red galaxies at small scales (more

of these clusters of consistent age, which we re-evaluate, confirms they have
consistent [Fe/H] and provides a foundation to investigate the poorly

standard stellar evolution theory, but possible explanations abound. We
supplement our A(Li) with previously published results placed on a uniform
abundance scale. This creates the largest self-consistently analyzed sample of
A(Li) in both the Hyades (90) and Praesepe (110). For each star, high-precision
UBVRI photometry was used to determine a ten color-based Teff and then to test
for photometric peculiarities indicated by a large sigma-Teff (> 75 K). The
stars with large sigma-Teff were predominantly found to be binaries or stars
with peculiar (apparent) A(Li). When considering only proper-motion members
that have low sigma-Teff and are also photometrically consistent with the
cluster MS fiducial, each cluster has a more tightly defined Li morphology than
previously observed and the two clusters' A(Li) are indistinguishable. This
suggests that clusters of consistent age and metallicity may have consistent
Li-depletion trends across a broad range of Teff; no additional major
parameters are required, at least for these two clusters. We propose that the

energies (E > 4 Ryd) is important to study the He II reionization, thermal
history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and metal lines observed in QSO
absorption spectra. It is determined by the emissivity of QSOs at E > 4 Ryd
obtained from their observed luminosity functions and the mean spectral energy
distribution (SED). The SED is approximated as a power-law at energies E > 1
Ryd, $f_E \propto E^{\alpha}$, where the existing observations constrain the
power-law index $\alpha$ only up to ~2.3 Ryd. Here, we constrain $\alpha$ for E
> 4 Ryd using recently measured He II Lyman-alpha effective optical depths
($\tau_{HeII}$), H I photoionization rates and updated H I distribution in the
IGM. We find that -1.6 > $\alpha$ > -2 is required to reproduce the
$\tau_{HeII}$ measurements when we use QSO emissivity obtained from their
luminosity function using optical surveys. We also find that the models where
QSOs can alone reionize H I can not reproduce the $\tau_{HeII}$ measurements.
These models need modifications, such as a break in mean QSO SED at energies
greater than 4 Ryd. Even after such modifications the predicted He II
reionization history, showing that the He II is highly ionized even at z~5, is
significantly different from the standard models. Therefore, the thermal
history of the IGM will be crucial to distinguish these models. We also provide
the He II photoionization rates obtained from binned $\tau_{HeII}$
measurements.

deviations from general relativity (GR) are satisfied by virtue of a so-called
screening mechanism, which enables the theory to revert to GR in regions where
the matter density is high or the gravitational potential is deep. In the case
of chameleon theories, the screening has two contributions -- self-screening,
which is due to the mass of an object itself, and environmental screening,
which is caused by the surrounding matter -- which are often entangled, with
the second contribution being more crucial for less massive objects. A
quantitative understanding of the effect of the environment on the screening
can prove critical in observational tests of such theories using systems such
as the Local Group and dwarf galaxies, for which the environment may be
inferred in various ways. We use the high-resolution {\sc liminality}
simulation of Shi et al. (2015) to test the fidelity of different definitions
of environment. We find that, although the different ways to define environment
in practice do not agree with one another perfectly, they can provide useful
guidance, and cross checks about how well a dark matter halo is screened. In
addition, the screening of subhaloes in dark matter haloes is primarily
determined by the environment, with the subhalo mass playing a minor role,
which means that lower-resolution simulations where subhaloes are not well
resolved can still be useful for understanding the modification of gravity
inside subhaloes.

formation at $M_\star \simeq 0.1\,\text{M}_\odot$ until their growth to
$M_\star \simeq 10^5\,\text{M}_\odot$. To calculate the initial properties of
the object in the optically thick regime we follow two approaches: based on
idealized thermodynamic considerations, and on a more detailed one-zone model.
Both methods derive a similar value of $n_{\rm F} \simeq 2 \times 10^{17}
\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ for the density of the object when opacity becomes important,
i.e. the opacity limit. The subsequent evolution of the growing protostar is
determined by the accretion of gas onto the object and can be described by a
mass-radius relation of the form $R_\star \propto M_\star^{1/3}$ during the
early stages, and of the form $R_\star \propto M_\star^{1/2}$ when internal
luminosity becomes important. For the case of a supermassive protostar, this
implies that the radius of the star grows from $R_\star \simeq 0.65 \,{\rm AU}$
to $R_\star \simeq 250 \,{\rm AU}$ during its evolution. Finally, we use this
model to construct a sub-grid recipe for accreting sink particles in numerical
simulations. A prime ingredient thereof is a physically motivated prescription
for the accretion radius and the effective temperature of the growing protostar
embedded inside it. From the latter, we can conclude that photo-ionization
feedback can be neglected until very late in the assembly process of the
supermassive object.

contribution is related to the orientation of a color dipole with respect to
its impact parameter, which in turn probes the transverse inhomogeneity in the
target. Using the McLerran-Venugopalan model (with impact-parameter dependence)
as an effective description for the soft gluon distribution in the (proton or

scattering amplitude, including its angular dependence. We find that the
angular dependence is controlled by soft gluon exchanges and hence is genuinely
non-perturbative. The effects of multiple scattering turn out to be essential
(in particular, they change the sign of $v_2$). We find that sizable values for
$v_2$, comparable to those observed in the LHC data and having a similar
dependence upon the transverse momenta of the produced particles, can be easily
generated via peripheral collisions. In particular, $v_2$ develops a peak at a
transverse momentum which scales with the saturation momentum in the target.

in quantum information technology, molecular chemistry and atomic physics. In
this paper, an improved differential evolution algorithm, referred to as
\emph{msMS}\_DE, is proposed to search robust fields for various quantum
control problems. In \emph{msMS}\_DE, multiple samples are used for fitness
evaluation and a mixed strategy is employed for the mutation operation. In
particular, the \emph{msMS}\_DE algorithm is applied to the control problems of
(i) open inhomogeneous quantum ensembles and (ii) the consensus goal of a
quantum network with uncertainties. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the excellent performance of the improved machine learning
algorithm for these two classes of quantum robust control problems.
Furthermore, \emph{msMS}\_DE is experimentally implemented on femtosecond laser
control applications to optimize two-photon absorption and control
fragmentation of the molecule $\text{CH}_2\text{BrI}$. Experimental results
demonstrate excellent performance of \emph{msMS}\_DE in searching for effective
femtosecond laser pulses for various tasks.

VHC, the control input of the double-integrator is designed to asymptotically
stabilize the closed orbit and make the state of the double-integrator converge

signals impinging on a uniform linear array, with mutual coupling effects, is
addressed. This work proposes two novel approaches able to provide accurate
solutions, including at the endfire regions of the array. Firstly, a Bayesian
compressive sensing Kalman filter is developed, which accounts for the
predicted estimated signals rather than using the traditional sparse prior. The
posterior probability density function of the received source signals and the
expression for the related marginal likelihood function are derived
theoretically. Next, a Gibbs sampling based approach with indicator variables
in the sparsity prior is developed. This allows sparsity to be explicitly
enforced in different ways, including when an angle is too far from the
previous estimate. The proposed approaches are validated and evaluated over
different test scenarios and compared to the traditional relevance vector
machine based method. An improved accuracy in terms of average root mean square
error values is achieved (up to 73.39% for the modified relevance vector
machine based approach and 86.36% for the Gibbs sampling based approach). The
proposed approaches prove to be particularly useful for direction of arrival
estimation when the angle of arrival moves into the endfire region of the

orbital axis in Advanced~LIGO~O1 run on binary black hole (BBH)~merger
scenarios in which the merging BBHs have evolved from field binaries. The
coalescence time determines the initial orbital separation of BBHs. This, in
turn, determines whether the stars are synchronized before collapse and hence
determines their projected spins. Short coalescence times imply synchronization
and large spins. Among known stellar objects, Wolf-Rayet~(WR) stars seem the
only progenitors consistent with the low aligned spins observed in LIGO's~O1
provided that the orbital axis maintains its direction during the collapse. We
calculate the spin distribution of BBH mergers in the local Universe and its
redshift evolution for WR progenitors. Assuming that the BBH formation rate
peaks around a redshift of $\sim 2\,$--$\,3$, we show that BBH mergers in the
local Universe are dominated by low spin events. The high spin population
starts to dominate at a redshift of $\sim0.5\,$--$\,1.5$. WR stars are also
progenitors of long Gamma-Ray~Bursts~(LGRBs) that take place at a comparable
rate to BBH mergers. We discuss the possible connection between the two
phenomena. Additionally, we show that hypothetical Population~III star
progenitors are also possible. Although WR and Population~III progenitors are
consistent with the current data, both models predict a non-vanishing fraction
of high aligned spin BBH mergers. If those are not detected within the coming
LIGO/Virgo runs, it will be unlikely that the observed BBHs formed via field
binaries.

candidates in supersymmetry, but their annihilation cross sections are quite
large. For thermal generation and a single component DM setup the higgsinos or
wino may have masses of around 1 or 2-3 TeV respectively. For such DM
candidates, a small amount of slepton coannihilation may decrease the effective
DM annihilation cross section. This, in turn reduces the lower limit of the
relic density satisfied DM mass by more than 50%. Almost a similar degree of
reduction of the same limit is also seen for squark coannihilations. However,
on the contrary, for near degeneracy of squarks and higgsino DM, near its
generic upper limit, the associated coannihilations may decrease the relic
density, thus extending the upper limit towards higher DM masses. We also
compute the direct and indirect detection signals. Here, because of the
quasi-mass degeneracy of the squarks and the LSP, we come across a situation
where squark exchange diagrams may contribute significantly or more strongly
than the Higgs exchange contributions in the spin-independent direct detection
cross section of DM. For the higgsino-DM scenario, we observe that a DM mass of
600 GeV to be consistent with WMAP/PLANCK and LUX data for sfermion
coannihilations. The LUX data itself excludes the region of 450 to 600 GeV, by
a half order of magnitude of the cross-section, well below the associated
uncertainty. The similar combined lower limit for a wino DM is about 1.1 TeV.
There is hardly any collider bound from the LHC for squarks and sleptons in
such a compressed scenario where sfermion masses are close to the mass of a
higgsino/wino LSP.

the boundaries of the most basic factorization assumptions and assess whether
improved starting points are needed. Using an idealized field-theoretic model

must confront, we retrace the steps of factorization approximations and compare
with calculations that keep all kinematics exact. We examine the relative
importance of such quantities as the target mass, light quark masses, and
intrinsic parton transverse momentum, and argue that a careful accounting of

experimental indication of many-body entanglement. They have proved themselves
to be a very efficient and useful tool to characterize quantum phase
transitions in a variety of quantum models conserving the total number of
particles (or magnetization for spin systems). In this Letter, we study the BCF
in generic one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (topological) models including the
Kitaev superconducting wire model, the Ising chain or various topological
insulators such as the SSH model. The considered charge (either the fermionic
number or the relative density) is no longer conserved, leading to macroscopic
fluctuations of the number of particles. We demonstrate that at phase
transitions characterized by a linear dispersion, the BCF probe the change in a
winding number that allows one to pinpoint the transition and corresponds to
the topological invariant for standard models. Additionally, we prove that a
sub-dominant logarithmic contribution is still present at the exact critical
point. Its quantized coefficient is universal and characterizes the critical
model. Results are extended to the Rashba topological nanowires and to the XYZ

estimation of system variables and parameters has played a pivotal role in many
fields of scientific inquiry where observations of the system are restricted to
a subset of variables. However in the case of censored observations, where
measurements of the system beyond a certain detection point are impossible, the
estimation problem is complicated. Without appropriate consideration, censored
observations can lead to inaccurate estimates. Motivated by the work of [1], we
develop a modified version of the extended Kalman filter to handle the case of
censored observations in nonlinear systems. We validate this methodology in a
simple oscillator system first, showing its ability to accurately reconstruct
state variables and track system parameters when observations are censored.
Finally, we utilize the nonlinear censored filter to analyze censored datasets

here detailed analysis of a superbolide, which occurred over Romania on January
7, 2015. The trajectory, velocity, and orbit were determined using two all-sky
photographs from a station of the European Fireball Network (EN) in Slovakia
and five casual video records from Romania, which were carefully calibrated.
Bolide light curve was measured by EN radiometers. We found that the entry
speed was 27.76 $\pm$ 0.19 km/s, significantly lower than reported by US
Government sensors. The orbit was asteroidal with low inclination and aphelion
inside Jupiter's orbit. The atmospheric behavior was, however, not typical for
an asteroidal body. The peak brightness of absolute magnitude of -21 was
reached at a quite large height of 42.8 km and the brightness then decreased
quickly. The bolide almost disappeared at a height of 38.7 km, leaving just a
stationary luminous trail visible for several seconds. Only one small fragment
continued until the height of 36 km. Brief meteorite searches were
unsuccessful. The modeling of the light curve revealed that the body of initial
mass of about 4500 kg remained almost intact until the dynamic pressure reached
0.9 MPa but it was then quickly disintegrated into many tiny fragments and dust
under 1-3 MPa. A comparison was made with three other superbolides for which we
have radiometric light curves: ordinary chondrite fall Ko\v{s}ice, carbonaceous
chondrite fall Maribo, and cometary Taurid bolide of October 31, 2015. The
Romanian superbolide was not similar to any of these and represents probably a
new type of material with intrinsic strength of about 1 MPa.

different species for a resource often requires the cooperation of several
individuals in groups. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hawk-Dove
Game for an arbitrary number of agents: the N-person Hawk-Dove Game. In this
model, doves exemplify the cooperative behavior without intraspecies conflict,
while hawks represent the aggressive behavior. In the absence of hawks, doves
share the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to
doves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at
the cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient
number to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus
avoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact
equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed
populations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both
species. Furthermore, by varying the different parameters, we found a scenario
of bifurcations that leads the system from dominating hawks and coexistence to
bi-stability, multiple interior equilibria and dominating doves.

gas due to ram pressure and thermal conduction in the intracluster medium
(ICM). At the density and temperature of the ICM, the mean free paths of ICM
electrons are comparable to the sizes of galaxies, therefore electrons can
efficiently transport heat due to thermal conduction from the hot ICM to the
cooler ISM. Galaxies consisting of dark matter halos and hot gas coronae are
embedded in an ICM-like `wind tunnel' in our simulations. In this paper, we
assume that thermal conduction is isotropic and include the effects of
saturation. We find that as heat is transferred from the ICM to the ISM, the
cooler denser ISM expands and evaporates. This process is significantly faster
than gas loss due to ram pressure stripping; for our standard model galaxy the
evaporation time is $160$ Myr while the ram pressure stripping timescale is
$2.5$ Gyr. Thermal conduction also suppresses the formation of shear
instabilities, and there are no stripped ISM tails since the ISM evaporates
before tails can form. Observations of long-lived X-ray emitting coronae and
ram pressure stripped X-ray tails in galaxies in group and cluster environments
therefore require that thermal conduction is suppressed or offset by some
additional physical process. The most likely process is anisotropic thermal
conduction due to magnetic fields in the ISM and ICM, which we simulate and
study in the next paper in this series.

platform is developed that fully captures the effects of the low-energy
renormalization of the nanowire modes arising from the presence of the parent
superconductor. In this model, the parent superconductor is an active component
that participates explicitly in the low-energy physics, not just a passive
partner that only provides proximity-induced Cooper pairs for the nanowire.
This treatment on an equal footing of the superconductor and the semiconductor
has become necessary in view of recent experiments, which do not allow a
consistent interpretation based just on the bare semiconductor properties. The
general theory involves the evaluation of the exact semiconductor Green
function that includes a dynamical self-energy correction arising from the
tunnel-coupled superconductor. General conditions for the emergence of
topological superconductivity are worked out for single-band as well as
multi-band nanowires and detailed numerical results are given for both infinite
and finite wire cases. The topological quantum phase diagrams are provided
numerically and the Majorana bound states are obtained along with their
oscillatory energy splitting behaviors due to wavefunction overlap in finite
wires. Renormalization effects are shown to be both qualitatively and
quantitatively important in modifying the low-energy spectrum of the nanowire.
The results of the theory are found to be in good qualitative agreement with
Majorana nanowire experiments, leading to the conclusion that the
proximity-induced low-energy renormalization of the nanowire modes by the
parent superconductor is of fundamental importance in
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures. Implications of the general
theory for obtaining true zero energy topological Majorana modes are pointed
out.

Informally, the capacity of a network is simply the total amount of information
which it can transfer. In the context of models of wireless radio networks,
this has usually meant the total number of point-to-point messages which can be
sent or received in one time step. This definition has seen intensive study in
recent years, particularly with respect to more accurate models of radio
networks such as the SINR model. This paper is motivated by an obvious fact:
radio antennae are (at least traditionally) omnidirectional, and hence
point-to-point connections are not necessarily the best definition of the true
capacity of a wireless network. To fix this, we introduce a new definition of
reception capacity as the maximum number of messages which can be received in
one round, and show that this is related to a new optimization problem we call
the Maximum Perfect Dominated Set (MaxPDS) problem. Using this relationship we
give a tight lower bound for approximating this capacity which essentially
matches a known upper bound. As our main result, we analyze this notion of
capacity under game-theoretic constraints, giving tight bounds on the average
quality achieved at any coarse correlated equilibrium (and thus at any Nash).
This immediately gives bounds on the average behavior of the natural
distributed algorithm in which every transmitter uses online learning
algorithms to learn whether to transmit.

tree of locally sound inferences by allowing proof objects to be potentially

preclude spurious cyclic reasoning, cyclic proof systems come equipped with a
well-founded notion of 'size' for the models that interpret their logical
statements. A global soundness condition on proof objects, stated in terms of
this notion of size, ensures that any non-well-founded paths in the proof

  We give an abstract definition of a subclass of such cyclic proof systems:
cyclic entailment systems. In this setting, we consider the problem of
comparing the size of a model when interpreted in relation to the antecedent of
an entailment, with that when interpreted in relation to the consequent.
Specifically, we give a further condition on proof objects which ensures that

respectively. While exact 3D solutions would be desired, they are extremely
difficult to find in stationary MHD. We construct solutions with magnetic and
flow vector fields that have three components depending on all three
coordinates. We show that the non-canonical transformation method produces
quasi-3D solutions of stationary MHD by mapping 2D or 2.5D MHS equilibria to
corresponding stationary MHD states, i.e., states that display the same field
line structure as the original MHS equilibria. These stationary MHD states
exist on magnetic flux surfaces of the original 2D MHS states. Although the
flux surfaces and therefore also the equilibria have a 2D character, these
stationary MHD states depend on all three coordinates and display highly
complex currents. The existence of geometrically complex 3D currents within
symmetric field-line structures provide the base for efficient dissipation of
the magnetic energy in the solar corona by Ohmic heating. We also discuss the
possibility of maintaining an important subset of non-linear MHS states, namely
force-free fields, by stationary flows. We find that force-free fields with

rational relationship then the orbit is also periodic in the inertial frame. We
prove that a dense set of Lyapunov orbits, with frequencies satisfying a
diophantine equation, correspond to choreographies. We present a sample of the
many choreographies that we have determined numerically along the Lyapunov
families and along bifurcating families, namely for the cases $n=4,~6,~7,~8$,
and $9$. We also present numerical results for the case where there is a
central body that affects the choreography, but that does not participate in
it. Animations of the families and the choreographies can be seen at the link:

  detection of single fluorophores",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ensemble averaging experiments may conceal many fundamental molecular
interactions. To overcome that, a high-throughput detection of single molecules
or colloidal nanodots is crucial for biomedical, nanoelectronic, and
solid-state applications. One-dimensional (1D) discrete flow of nanoscale
objects is an efficient approach in this direction. The development of simple
and cost-effective nanofluidic devices is a critical step to realise 1D flow.
This letter presents a nanofabrication technique using
shadow-angle-electron-beam-deposition for a high-throughput preparation of
parallel nanofluidic channels. These were used to flow and detect DNA,
carbon-nanodots, and organic fluorophores. The 1D molecular mass transport was
performed using electro-osmotic flow. The 1D flow behaviour was identified and
analysed using two-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (2fFCS). A range
of flow velocities of single molecules was achieved. The transitions of single
molecules or nanodots through the two foci were quantitatively analysed using
confocal scanning imaging, correlative photon detection, and burst size
distribution analysis. The results suggest an efficient nanofabrication
technique is developed to prepare nanofluidic devices. This first demonstration
of high-throughput nanochannel fabrication process and using 2fFCS-based single
molecule flow detection should have a potential impact on ultra-sensitive
biomedical diagnostics and studying biomolecular interactions as well as
nanomaterials.

more important but more challenging. When observations are hierarchically
clustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with
mixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are
not included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method
called boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for
exploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect
predictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for
missing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called
metboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the
structure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal
node means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to
different predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group
specific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for
thousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing
values. We apply the method to predict math performance for 15,240 students
from 751 schools in data collected in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002
(Ingels et al., 2007), allowing 76 predictors to have unique effects for each
school. When comparing results to boosted decision trees, metboost has 15%
improved prediction performance. Results of a large simulation study show that
metboost has up to 70% improved variable selection performance and up to 30%
improved prediction performance compared to boosted decision trees when group

that measurement of the pointer steers the remaining degree(s) of freedom into

allows us to conditionalize on a final state if we choose, so the
'post-selection' that features prominently in time-symmetric formulations is
also equipment from standard quantum theory. Assertions in the literature that
weak measurements leave a system negligibly disturbed, and/or that standard
quantum theory is cumbersome for computing the predicted measurement results,
are therefore unsupportable, and ontological claims based on such assertions

Schur functions in terms of unitary operators. We propose a generalization of
Schur functions by extending this operator representation to arbitrary

structure of first return generating functions, thus we call them FR-functions.
We derive general properties of FR-functions, among them a generalization of
the renewal equation already known for random and quantum walks, as well as
splitting properties which extend useful factorizations of Schur functions.
  When specialized to self-adjoint operators, FR-functions become Nevanlinna
functions. This leads to new results on Nevanlinna functions: decomposition
rules which are the analogue of useful factorizations of Schur functions, a
simple Nevanlinna version of the Schur algorithm and new operator and integral
representations of Nevanlinna functions which, in contrast to standard ones,
are exact analogues of those already known for Schur functions, giving
similarly a one-to-one correspondence between Nevanlinna functions and measures
on the real line.
  The paper is completed with several applications of FR-functions to
orthogonal polynomials and random and quantum walks which illustrate their wide
interest: an analogue for orthogonal polynomials on the real line of the
Khrushchev formula for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, and the use
of FR-functions to study recurrence in random walks, quantum walks and open
quantum walks. These applications provide numerous explicit examples of
FR-functions and their splittings and show that these new tools, despite being
extensions of very classical ones, play an important role in the study of
physical problems of a highly topical nature.

  Patients",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Readmission rates in the hospitals are increasingly being used as a benchmark
to determine the quality of healthcare delivery to hospitalized patients.
Around three-fourths of all hospital re-admissions can be avoided, saving
billions of dollars. Many hospitals have now deployed electronic health record
(EHR) systems that can be used to study issues that trigger readmission.
However, most of the EHRs are high dimen-sional and sparsely populated, and
analyzing such data sets is a Big Data challenge. The effect of some of the
well-known dimension reduction techniques is minimized due to presence of
non-linear variables. We use association mining as a dimension reduction method
and the results are used to develop models, using data from an existing nursing
EHR system, for predicting risk of re-admission to the hospitals. These models
can help in determining effective treatments for patients to minimize the
possibility of re-admission, bringing down the cost and increasing the quality
of care provided to the patients. Results from the models show significantly
accurate predictions of patient re-admission.

group division and group energy-minimization; however, lacking overall
object-group topology modeling limits their ability in handling complex object

objects, we propose a Graphical Social Topology (GST) model, which estimates
the group dynamics by jointly modeling the group structure and the states of
objects using a topological representation. With such topology representation,
moving objects are not only assigned to groups, but also dynamically connected
with each other, which enables in-group individuals to be correctly associated
and the cohesion of each group to be precisely modeled. Using well-designed
topology learning modules and topology training, we infer the birth/death and
merging/splitting of dynamic groups. With the GST model, the proposed
multi-object tracker can naturally facilitate the occlusion problem by treating
the occluded object and other in-group members as a whole while leveraging
overall state transition. Experiments on both RGB and RGB-D datasets confirm
that the proposed multi-object tracker improves the state-of-the-arts

education, but the process of constructing, testing, and refining these models
is much less common. We focus our attention on a lab course that has been
transformed to engage students in this modeling process during lab activities.
The design of the lab activities was guided by a framework that captures the
different components of model-based reasoning, called the Modeling Framework
for Experimental Physics. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to
assess students' written work and to identify how students' model-based
reasoning differed from activity to activity. Broadly speaking, we were able to
identify the different steps of students' model-based reasoning and assess the
completeness of their reasoning. Varying degrees of scaffolding present across
the activities had an impact on how thoroughly students would engage in the
full modeling process, with more scaffolded activities resulting in more
thorough engagement with the process. Finally, we identified that the step in
the process with which students had the most difficulty was the comparison
between their interpreted data and their model prediction. Students did not use
sufficiently sophisticated criteria in evaluating such comparisons, which had
the effect of halting the modeling process. This may indicate that in order to
engage students further in using model-based reasoning during lab activities,
the instructor needs to provide further scaffolding for how students make these
types of experimental comparisons. This is an important design consideration
for other such courses attempting to incorporate modeling as a learning goal.

millions of consignments that arrive should be inspected, is a perennial
problem for regulatory authorities. The objective of these inspections is to
minimise the risk of contraband entering the country. As an example, for
regulatory authorities in charge of biosecurity material, consignments of goods
are classified before arrival according to their economic tariff number
(Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 2016). This classification,
perhaps along with other information, is used as a screening step to determine
whether further biosecurity intervention, such as inspection, is necessary.
Other information associated with consignments includes details such as the
country of origin, supplier, and importer, for example.

interception is a rare event, however this sparsity undermines the utility of
historical records for deciding which containers to inspect.

stochastic diffusion due to micro-turbulence can be the dominant energetic
particle detuning mechanism near the resonances in many plasma experiments, and
its strength is the key as to whether chirping solutions are likely to arise.
The proposed criterion constitutes a useful predictive tool in assessing
whether the nature of the transport for fast ion losses in fusion devices will
be dominated by convective or diffusive processes.

has become an interesting but tedious task among data scientists, particularly

data completion techniques had been introduced, especially in the advent of
kernel methods. However, among the many data completion techniques available in
the literature, studies about mutually completing several incomplete kernel
matrices have not been given much attention yet. In this paper, we present a
new method, called Mutual Kernel Matrix Completion (MKMC) algorithm, that
tackles this problem of mutually inferring the missing entries of multiple
kernel matrices by combining the notions of data fusion and kernel matrix
completion, applied on biological data sets to be used for classification task.
We first introduced an objective function that will be minimized by exploiting
the EM algorithm, which in turn results to an estimate of the missing entries
of the kernel matrices involved. The completed kernel matrices are then
combined to produce a model matrix that can be used to further improve the
obtained estimates. An interesting result of our study is that the E-step and
the M-step are given in closed form, which makes our algorithm efficient in
terms of time and memory. After completion, the (completed) kernel matrices are
then used to train an SVM classifier to test how well the relationships among
the entries are preserved. Our empirical results show that the proposed
algorithm bested the traditional completion techniques in preserving the
relationships among the data points, and in accurately recovering the missing
kernel matrix entries. By far, MKMC offers a promising solution to the problem

this study, we propose cache replication and eviction schemes, Conditional
Leave Cope Everywhere (CLCE) and Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU), which are
well suited for the ICN type of cache networks (CNs). The CLCE replication
scheme reduces the redundant caching of contents; hence improves the cache
space utilization. LFRU approximates the Least Frequently Used (LFU) scheme
coupled with the Least Recently Used (LRU) scheme and is practically
implementable for rapidly changing cache networks like ICNs.

low complexity progressive puncturing search algorithm on a base code of short

length, through puncturing or repetition. The rate-matching scheme is implied
by a two-stage polarization, for transmission at any desired code length, code
rate, and modulation order, and is shown to achieve the symmetric capacity of
BICM channels. Numerical results on AWGN and fast fading channels show that the

nodes in social networks can be influential, driving opinions and spreading

navigate via clicks, central content receives high traffic, becoming targets
for advertising campaigns. While there is an extensive amount of work on
centrality measures and their efficient computation, controlling nodes'
centrality via network updates is a more recent and challenging problem.
Performing minimal modifications to a network to achieve a desired property
falls under the umbrella of network design problems. This paper is focused on
improving the coverage centrality of a set of nodes, which is the number of
pairs of nodes that have a shortest path passing through the set, by adding
edges to the network. We prove strong inapproximability results and propose a
greedy algorithm for maximizing coverage centrality. To ensure scalability to
large networks, we also design an efficient sampling algorithm for the problem.
In addition to providing an extensive empirical evaluation of our algorithms,
we also show that, under some realistic constraints, the proposed solutions
achieve almost-optimal approximation for coverage centrality maximization.

whole system is driven out of equilibrium for $T_S \neq T_L$. The model is a
generalization of the $q$-neighbor Ising model, which corresponds to the
limiting case of $T_L=\infty$. Despite the mean field nature of the

phase and a paramagnetic phase. The two phases are separated by a continuous
phase transition belonging to the mean field universality class or by a
discontinuous phase transition with an intervening coexistence phase. The
equilibrium system with $T_S=T_L$ falls into the former case while the
$q$-neighbor Ising model falls into the latter case. At the tricritical point,
the system exhibits the mean field tricritical behavior. Our model demonstrates
a possibility that a continuous phase transition turns into a discontinuous
transition by a nonequilibrium driving. Heat flow induced by the temperature
difference between two heat baths is also studied.

The order of magnitude of this estimate was never improved up to this date. The
best bounds for $S(t)$ and $S_1(t)$ are currently due to Carneiro, Chandee and
Milinovich. In this paper we establish, under RH, an explicit form of this
estimate \begin{equation*} -\left( C^-_n + o(1)\right) \frac{\log t}{(\log \log
t)^{n+1}} \ \leq \ S_n(t) \ \leq \ \left( C^+_n + o(1)\right) \frac{\log
t}{(\log \log t)^{n+1}}\,, \end{equation*} for all $n\geq 2$, with the
constants $C_n^{\pm}$ decaying exponentially fast as $n \to \infty$. This
improves (for all $n \geq 2$) a result of Wakasa, who had previously obtained
such bounds with constants tending to a stationary value when $n \to \infty$.
Our method uses special extremal functions of exponential type derived from the
Gaussian subordination framework of Carneiro, Littmann and Vaaler for the cases
when $n$ is odd, and an optimized interpolation argument for the cases when $n$
is even. In the final section we extend these results to a general class of
$L$-functions.

the range $1.4\times10^{10}\leq Ra_F \leq 1.2\times10^{12}$ with the Prandtl
number Pr fixed at 4.3. It is found that the presence of the insulating lids
leads to reduction of the global heat transfer efficiency as expected, which
primarily depends on the insulating area but is insensitive to the detailed
insulating patterns. At the leading order level, the magnitude of temperature
fluctuation in the bulk fluid is, again, found to be insensitive to the
insulating pattern and mainly depends on the insulating area; while the
temperature probability density function (PDF) in the bulk is essentially
invariant with respect to both insulating area and the spatial pattern of the
lids. The flow dynamics, on the other hand, is sensitive to both the covering
area and the spatial distribution of the lids. At fixed $Ra_F$, the flow
strength is found to increase with increasing insulating area so as to transfer
the same amount of heat through a smaller cooling area. Moreover, for a
constant insulating area, a symmetric insulating pattern results in a symmetric
flow pattern, i.e. double-roll structure; whereas asymmetric insulating pattern
leads to asymmetric flow, i.e. single-roll structure. It is further found that
the symmetry breaking of the insulating pattern leads to a stronger flow that
enhances the horizontal velocity more than the vertical one.

between two banana-shaped inclusions are derived theoretically using a
point-like formalism based on fixed anisotropic curvatures, both for zero
surface tension and for finite surface tension. On a larger scale, the
interactions between assemblies of such rodlike inclusions are determined
analytically. Meshless membrane simulations are performed in the presence of a
large number of inclusions of two types, corresponding to curved rods of
opposite curvatures, both for flat membranes and vesicles. Rods of the same
type aggregate into linear assemblies perpendicular to the rod axis, leading to
membrane tubulation. However, rods of the other type, those of opposite
curvature, are attracted to the lateral sides of these assemblies, and
stabilize a straight bump structure that prevents tubulation. When the two
types of rods have almost opposite curvatures, the bumps attract one another,
forming a stripe structure. Positive surface tension is found to stabilize the
stripe formation. The simulation results agree well with the theoretical
predictions provided the point-like curvatures of the model are scaled-down to
account for the effective flexibility of the simulated rods.

survey of young clusters. We focus on the Orion A star-forming region, for
which IN-SYNC obtained spectra of $\sim2700$ stars. In Paper IV we used these
data to study the young stellar population. Here we study the kinematic
properties through radial velocities ($v_r$). The young stellar population
remains kinematically associated with the molecular gas, following a
$\sim10\:{\rm{km\:s}}^{-1}$ gradient along filament. However, near the center
of the region, the $v_r$ distribution is slightly blueshifted and asymmetric;
we suggest that this population, which is older, is slightly in foreground. We
find evidence for kinematic subclustering, detecting statistically significant
groupings of co-located stars with coherent motions. These are mostly in the
lower-density regions of the cloud, while the ONC radial velocities are
smoothly distributed, consistent with it being an older, more dynamically
evolved cluster. The velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ varies along the filament.
The ONC appears virialized, or just slightly supervirial, consistent with an
old dynamical age. Here there is also some evidence for on-going expansion,
from a $v_r$--extinction correlation. In the southern filament, $\sigma_v$ is
$\sim2$--$3$ times larger than virial in the L1641N region, where we infer a
superposition along the line of sight of stellar sub-populations, detached from
the gas. On the contrary, $\sigma_v$ decreases towards L1641S, where the
population is again in agreement with a virial state.

This 3D information introduces a new conceptual change that can be utilized to
improve the results of over-segmentation, which uses mainly color information,
and to generate clusters of points we call super-points. We consider a variety
of possible 3D extensions of the Local Variation (LV) graph based
over-segmentation algorithms, and compare them thoroughly. We consider
different alternatives for constructing the connectivity graph, for assigning
the edge weights, and for defining the merge criterion, which must now account
for the geometric information and not only color. Following this evaluation, we
derive a new generic algorithm for over-segmentation of 3D point clouds. We
call this new algorithm Point Cloud Local Variation (PCLV). The advantages of
the new over-segmentation algorithm are demonstrated on both outdoor and
cluttered indoor scenes. Performance analysis of the proposed approach compared
to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D over-segmentation algorithms shows significant

of voids pervading the mineralized bone matrix of most vertebrates. This
osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) is believed to play important roles
in mechanosensing, mineral homeostasis, and for the mechanical properties of
bone. While the extracellular matrix structure of bone is extensively studied
on ultrastructural and macroscopic scales, there is a lack of quantitative
knowledge on how the cellular network is organized. Using a recently introduced
imaging and quantification approach, we analyze the OLCN in different bone
types from mouse and sheep that exhibit different degrees of structural
organization not only of the cell network but also of the fibrous matrix
deposited by the cells. We define a number of robust, quantitative measures
that are derived from the theory of complex networks. These measures enable us
to gain insights into how efficient the network is organized with regard to
intercellular transport and communication. Our analysis shows that the cell
network in regularly organized, slow-growing bone tissue from sheep is less
connected, but more efficiently organized compared to irregular and
fast-growing bone tissue from mice. On the level of statistical topological
properties (edges per node, edge length and degree distribution), both network
types are indistinguishable, highlighting that despite pronounced differences
at the tissue level, the topological architecture of the osteocyte canalicular
network at the subcellular level may be independent of species and bone type.
Our results suggest a universal mechanism underlying the self-organization of
individual cells into a large, interconnected network during bone formation and
mineralization.

the present work we focus on continuous measurement of atomic currents in
lattice models, including the Hubbard model. We describe a Cavity QED setup,
where measurement of a homodyne current provides a faithful representation of
the atomic current as a function of time. We employ the quantum optical
description in terms of a diffusive stochastic Schr\""odinger equation to follow
the time evolution of the atomic system conditional to observing a given
homodyne current trajectory, thus accounting for the competition between the
Hamiltonian evolution and measurement back-action. As an illustration, we
discuss minimal models of atomic dynamics and continuous current measurement on
rings with synthetic gauge fields, involving both real space and synthetic
dimension lattices (represented by internal atomic states). Finally, by `not
reading' the current measurements the time evolution of the atomic system is
governed by a master equation, where - depending on the microscopic details of
our CQED setups - we effectively engineer a current coupling of our system to a
quantum reservoir. This provides novel scenarios of dissipative dynamics
generating `dark' pure quantum many-body states.

algorithms for learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs). Spectral
algorithms have appealing theoretical guarantees; however, the resulting models
do not always perform well on inference tasks in practice. One reason for this
behavior is the mismatch between the intended task (accurate filtering or
prediction) and the loss function being optimized by the algorithm (estimation
error in model parameters).
  A natural idea is to improve performance by refining PSRs using an algorithm
such as EM. Unfortunately it is not obvious how to apply apply an EM style
algorithm in the context of PSRs as the Log Likelihood is not well defined for
all PSRs. We show that it is possible to overcome this problem using ideas from
Predictive State Inference Machines.
  We combine spectral algorithms for PSRs as a consistent and efficient
initialization with PSIM-style updates to refine the resulting model
parameters. By combining these two ideas we develop Inference Gradients, a
simple, fast, and robust method for practical learning of PSRs. Inference
Gradients performs gradient descent in the PSR parameter space to optimize an
inference-based loss function like PSIM. Because Inference Gradients uses a
spectral initialization we get the same consistency benefits as PSRs. We show
that Inference Gradients outperforms both PSRs and PSIMs on real and synthetic
data sets.

interplanetary space is not well understood due to limited observations. In
this study we examine the propagation characteristics of two geo-effective
CMEs, which occurred on 2005 May 6 and 13, respectively. Significant
heliospheric consequences associated with the two CMEs are observed, including
interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) at the Earth and Ulysses, interplanetary shocks, a
long-duration type II radio burst, and intense geomagnetic storms. We use
coronagraph observations from SOHO/LASCO, frequency drift of the long-duration
type II burst, in situ measurements at the Earth and Ulysses, and
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) propagation of the observed solar wind disturbances
at 1 AU to track the CMEs from the Sun far into interplanetary space. We find
that both of the two CMEs underwent a major deceleration within 1 AU and
thereafter a gradual deceleration when they propagated from the Earth to deep
interplanetary space due to interactions with the ambient solar wind. The
results also reveal that the two CMEs interacted with each other in the distant
interplanetary space even though their launch times on the Sun were well
separated. The intense geomagnetic storm for each case was caused by the
southward magnetic fields ahead of the CME, stressing the critical role of the
sheath region in geomagnetic storm generation, although for the first case
there is a corotating interaction region involved.

data in 12CO (1-0). To examine the environmental dependence of GMA properties,
GMAs are classified based on their locations in the various environments as
circumnuclear ring (CNR), bar, spiral, and inter-arm GMAs. The CNR GMAs are
massive and compact, while the inter-arm GMAs are diffuse with low surface
density. GMA mass and size are strongly correlated, as suggested by Larson
(1981). However, the diverse power-law index of the relation implies that the
GMA properties are not uniform among the environments. The CNR and bar GMAs
show higher velocity dispersion than those in other environments. We find
little evidence for a correlation between GMA velocity dispersion and size,
which indicates that the GMAs are in diverse dynamical states. Indeed, the
virial parameter of GMAs spans nearly two orders of magnitude. Only the spiral
GMAs are in general self-gravitating. Star formation activity of the GMAs
decreases in order over the CNR, spiral, bar, and the inter-arm GMAs. The
diverse GMA and star formation properties in different environments lead to
variations in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. A combination of multiple
mechanisms or gas phase change is necessary to explain the observed slopes.
Comparisons of GMA properties acquired with the use of the 12-m-array
observations with those from the feathered data are also presented. The results

correlations while reducing their coherence. In contrast, for two-point density
correlations, the initial ballistic propagation regime gives way to diffusion
at intermediate times. Numerical simulations, based on a time-dependent matrix
product state algorithm, are supplemented by a quantitatively accurate
fermionic quasi-particle approach providing an intuitive description of the
initial dynamics in terms of holon and doublon excitations.

renormalization group flow, provides an elegant mechanism for completing the
gravitational force at sub-Planckian scales. At high energies the fixed point
controls the scaling of couplings such that unphysical divergences are absent
while the emergence of classical low-energy physics is linked to a crossover
between two renormalization group fixed points. These features make Asymptotic
Safety an attractive framework for cosmological model building. The resulting
scenarios may naturally give rise to a quantum gravity driven inflationary
phase in the very early universe and an almost scale-free fluctuation spectrum.
Moreover, effective descriptions arising from an renormalization group

each time step, this algorithm involves an independent copy of a couple of
random maximal monotone operators. Defining a mean operator as a selection
integral, the differential inclusion built from the sum of the two mean
operators is considered. As a first result, it is shown that the interpolated
process obtained from the iterates converges narrowly in the small step regime
to the solution of this differential inclusion. In order to control the long
term behavior of the iterates, a stability result is needed in addition. To
this end, the sequence of the iterates is seen as a homogeneous Feller Markov
chain whose transition kernel is parameterized by the algorithm step size. The
cluster points of the Markov chains invariant measures in the small step regime
are invariant for the semiflow induced by the differential inclusion.
Conclusions regarding the long run behavior of the iterates for small steps are
drawn. It is shown that when the sum of the mean operators is demipositive, the
probabilities that the iterates are away from the set of zeros of this sum are
small in Ces\`aro mean. The ergodic behavior of these iterates is studied as
well. Applications of the proposed algorithm are considered. In particular, a

auto-oscillating modes in constriction-based spin Hall nano-oscillators as a
function of applied magnetic field with varying magnitude and out-of-plane
angle. We demonstrate that for all possible applied field configurations the
auto-oscillations emerge from the localized linear modes of the constriction.
For field directions tending towards the plane, these modes are of the
so-called ""edge"" type, i.e. localized at the opposite sides of the
constriction. When the magnetization direction instead approaches the film
normal, the modes transform to the so-called ""bulk"" type, i.e. localized inside
the constriction with substantially increased precession volume, consistent
with the re-distribution of the magnetic charges from the sides to the top and
bottom surfaces of the constriction. In general, the threshold current of the
corresponding auto-oscillations increases with the applied field strength and
decreases with its out-of-plane angle, consistent with the behavior of the
internal field and in good agreement with a macrospin model. A quantitative
agreement is then achieved by taking into account the strongly non-uniform
character of the system via a mean-field approximation. Both the Oe field and
the spin transfer torque from the drive current increase the localization and
decrease the frequency of the observed mode. Furthermore, the anti-symmetric Oe
field breaks the lateral symmetry, favoring the localized mode at one of the
two constriction edges, in particular for large out-of-plane field angles where
the threshold current is significantly increased and the edge demagnetization
is suppressed.

Here we study single crystals of multiferroic Sr$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$, and show
that due to its nearly isotropic nature a purely quadrupolar bimagnon mode
appears in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. This non-magnetic
spin-excitation couples to the electric field of the light and becomes
observable for a specific experimental configuration, in full agreement with a
theoretical analysis of the selection rules.

solar cells. Recently, graphene-based ETLs have been proved to be good
candidate for scalable fabrication processes and to achieve higher carrier
injection with respect to most commonly used ETLs. In this work we
experimentally study the effects of different graphene-based ETLs in sensitized
MAPI solar cells. By means of time-integrated and picosecond time-resolved
photoluminescence techniques, the carrier recombination dynamics in MAPI films
embedded in different ETLs is investigated. Using graphene doped mesoporous
TiO2 (G+mTiO2) with the addition of a lithium-neutralized graphene oxide
(GO-Li) interlayer as ETL, we find that the carrier collection efficiency is
increased by about a factor two with respect to standard mTiO2. Taking
advantage of the absorption coefficient dispersion, we probe the MAPI layer
morphology, along the thickness, finding that the MAPI embedded in the ETL
composed by G+mTiO2 plus GO-Li brings to a very good crystalline quality of the
MAPI layer with a trap density about one order of magnitude lower than that
found with the other ETLs. In addition, this ETL freezes MAPI at the tetragonal
phase, regardless of the temperature. Graphene-based ETLs can open the way to
significant improvement of perovskite solar cells.

with a transversal electric field and the spin relaxation is usually described
by the so-called D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) mechanism. We combine a Monte Carlo
method and diagrammatic calculation based approaches in our study; the former
tracks the time evolution of electron spins in a quasiparticle dynamics

conventional result of the DP mechanism in the appropriate limit. We discuss
the full phase space of spin relaxation as a function of SOC strength, its
distribution, and the magnitude of the momentum relaxation rate. This allows us
to identify two novel spin-relaxation regimes; where spin relaxation is
strongly non-exponential and the spin relaxation equals the momentum
relaxation. A compelling analogy between the spin-relaxation theory and the NMR

we clearly demonstrate that the observed puzzling hump in the specific heat of
MnSi originates from smearing out of the virtual ferromagnetic second order
phase transition by helical fluctuations, which manifest themselves in the
transient multiple spiral state. These fluctuations finally condense into the
helical ordered phase via a first order phase transition as is indicated by the
specific heat peak. Thus the model demonstrates a crossover from a second-order

$D/J$ another crossover from a first-order to a second-order transition takes
place in the system. Moreover, the results of the calculations clearly indicate
that these competing interactions are the primary factor responsible for the

is to identify the correct match from a large collection of gallery images
depicting the same person captured by disjoint camera views. The critical
challenge is how to construct a robust yet discriminative feature
representation to capture the compounded variations in pedestrian appearance.
To this end, deep learning methods have been proposed to extract hierarchical
features against extreme variability of appearance. However, existing methods
in this category generally neglect the efficiency in the matching stage whereas
the searching speed of a re-identification system is crucial in real-world
applications. In this paper, we present a novel deep hashing framework with
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fast person re-identification.
Technically, we simultaneously learn both CNN features and hash functions/codes
to get robust yet discriminative features and similarity-preserving hash codes.
Thereby, person re-identification can be resolved by efficiently computing and
ranking the Hamming distances between images. A structured loss function
defined over positive pairs and hard negatives is proposed to formulate a novel
optimization problem so that fast convergence and more stable optimized
solution can be obtained. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks CUHK03
\cite{FPNN} and Market-1501 \cite{Market1501} show that the proposed deep
architecture is efficacy over state-of-the-arts.

reduction for internal and external flow applications. However, experiments
have shown inconsistent results, with many studies reporting significantly
reduced performance. Recently, it has been proposed that surfactants,
ubiquitous in flow applications, could be responsible, by creating adverse
Marangoni stresses. Yet, testing this hypothesis is challenging. Careful
experiments with purified water show large interfacial stresses and,
paradoxically, adding surfactants yields barely measurable drag increases. This
suggests that other physical processes, such as thermal Marangoni stresses or
interface deflection, could explain the lower performance. To test the
surfactant hypothesis, we perform the first numerical simulations of flows over
a SHS inclusive of surfactant kinetics. These simulations reveal that
surfactant-induced stresses are significant at extremely low concentrations,
potentially yielding a no-slip boundary condition on the air--water interface
(the ""plastron"") for surfactant amounts below typical environmental values.
These stresses decrease as the streamwise distance between plastron stagnation
points increases. We perform microchannel experiments with thermally-controlled
SHSs consisting of streamwise parallel gratings, which confirm this numerical
prediction. We introduce a new, unsteady test of surfactant effects. When we
rapidly remove the driving pressure following a loading phase, a backflow
develops at the plastron, which can only be explained by surfactant gradients
formed in the loading phase. This demonstrates the significance of surfactants
in deteriorating drag reduction, and thus the importance of including
surfactant stresses in SHS models. Our time-dependent protocol can assess the
impact of surfactants in SHS testing and guide future mitigating designs.

a vacuum expectation value. In this case, the Higgs fields with zero VEV does

usual considerations on the THDM models. We show that the stability of the
Higgs potential minima can be maintained. All the Higgs boson masses are found
lighter than about 300 GeV in the low scale spectrum when v_1=0. Such light
mass scales are in the detectable regime, and hence, the SM predictions and the
experimental results are essential to be applied in the analyses. Especially
the decay channels; h-->W^+ W^- and h-->bb exclude most of the solutions, while
it is still possible to realize a small region, which coincides with the SM
predictions. We highlight that it is also possible to realize an excess in h-->
gamma gamma decay channel, even one applies the constraints from the Higgs
boson decays into W^+ W^- and bb. In addition, if one assumes H is the SM-like
Higgs boson of mass about 125 GeV, the solutions with m_h <~ 125 GeV can be
acceptable. In this case, the solutions can still be realized consistent with
the SM predictions; however, an excess in H --> gamma gamma cannot be observed,

$\beta=0$ is consistent with the current data at $1\sigma$ level for the

model, we find that a smaller upper limit, $\sum m_{\nu}<0.11$ eV ($2\sigma$),

favor the emergence of itinerant magnetism: enhancement of the DOS of the
resonant defect states in the region of the Fermi level and tuning of the Fermi

likewise shown to enhance the DOS of the defect states, but it also effects a
detunig of the Fermi level that shifts away from the maximum of the DOS of the
defect states, which inhibts the emergence of magnetic states. As a result,
under biaxial strains the stabilization of a magnetic state depends on the
relative magnitudes of the two components of strain.

It is used by

  Bizur is aimed for services that require strongly consistent state, but do
not require a distributed log; for example, a distributed lock manager or a
distributed service locator. By avoiding a distributed log scheme, Bizur
outperforms distributed log based consensus algorithms, producing more IOPS and
guaranteeing lower latencies during normal operation and especially during
failures.
  Paxos-like algorithms (e.g., Zab and Raft) which are used by existing
distributed file-systems, can have artificial contention points due to their
dependence on a distributed log. The distributed log is needed when replicating
a general service, but when the desired service is key-value based, the
contention points created by the distributed log can be avoided.
  Bizur does exactly that, by reaching consensus independently on independent
keys. This independence allows Bizur to handle failures more efficiently and to
scale much better than other consensus algorithms, allowing the file-system
that utilizes Bizur to scale with it.

at other times tiny loops of new line appear from nowhere (births) and grow, or
the reverse, existing loops shrink and disappear (deaths). These three types

random wavefield that has isotropic stationary statistics, arising from a
superposition of an infinity of plane waves in different directions. A
simplifying 'axis fixing' technique is used to achieve this. The resulting

Thus reconnections are always more common than births and deaths combined. As

leverages two key design choices to achieve high performance. First, it relies

of clock skew. Second, Okapi achieves higher resource efficiency and better
availability, at the expense of a slight increase in update visibility latency.
To this end, Okapi implements a new stabilization protocol that uses a
combination of vector and scalar clocks and makes a remote update visible when
its delivery has been acknowledged by every data center. We evaluate Okapi with
different workloads on Amazon AWS, using three geographically distributed
regions and 96 nodes. We compare Okapi with two recent approaches to causal
consistency, Cure and GentleRain. We show that Okapi delivers up to two orders

is proposed able to achieve overhead-free beamforming training. Leveraging from
the CAVs sensory data, broadcast with Dedicated Short Range Communications
(DSRC) beacons, the position and the motion of a CAV can be estimated and
beamform accordingly. To minimise the position errors, an analysis of the
distinct error components was presented. The network performance is further
enhanced by adapting the antenna beamwidth with respect to the position error.
Our algorithm outperforms the legacy IEEE 802.11ad approach proving it a viable

conformal factor of a simple functional form; (b) the bulk path integral

this model to consider the question: when do correlations (quantum or
classical) between quantum sensors enhance the precision with which the network
can measure an unknown set of parameters? We rigorously answer this question
for a range of practically important problems. When each sensor in the network
measures a single parameter, we show that correlations between sensors cannot
increase the estimation precision beyond what can be achieved with an
uncorrelated scheme, regardless of the particular details of the estimation
problem in question. We also consider the more general setting whereby each
sensor may be used to measure multiple parameters, e.g., the three spatial
components of a magnetic field. In this case, we show that correlations between
sensors can only provide, at best, a small constant precision enhancement, over
uncorrelated estimation techniques. Finally, we consider optimizing the network
for measuring a single linear function of the unknown parameters, e.g., the
average of all of the parameters. Here quantum correlations between the sensors
can provide a significant precision enhancement over uncorrelated techniques,
and this enhancement factor scales with the number of sensors. To illustrate
the broad implications of this work, we apply our results to a wide range of
estimation problems of practical interest, including multi-mode optical
interferometry, networks of atomic sensors, and networks of clocks. Our
findings shed light on a number of results in the literature, provide a

the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition on explicit methods through corrective
implicit solves within each time step. In this work, we implement and evaluate
the performance of IMEX on manycore processors relative to explicit methods.
Using 3D-IMEX at Courant number C=15 , we obtained a speedup of about 4X
relative to an explicit time stepping method run with the maximum allowable
C=1. In addition, we demonstrate a much larger speedup of 100X at C=150 using
1D-IMEX due to the unconditional stability of the method in the vertical
direction. Several improvements on the IMEX procedure were necessary in order
to outperform our results with explicit methods: a) reducing the number of
degrees of freedom of the IMEX formulation by forming the Schur complement; b)
formulating a horizontally-explicit vertically-implicit (HEVI) 1D-IMEX scheme
that has a lower workload and potentially better scalability than 3D-IMEX; c)
using high-order polynomial preconditioners to reduce the condition number of
the resulting system; d) using a direct solver for the 1D-IMEX method by
performing and storing LU factorizations once to obtain a constant cost for any
Courant number. Without all of these improvements, explicit time integration
methods turned out to be difficult to beat. We discuss in detail the IMEX
infrastructure required for formulating and implementing efficient methods on
manycore processors. Finally, we validate our results with standard benchmark
problems in NWP and evaluate the performance and scalability of the IMEX method

of magnitude larger than the in-plane resistivity of highly oriented pyrolytic
bulk graphite and shows a small resistivity ratio($\rho(2{\rm K})/\rho(315{\rm

optimized particularly for applications in molecular beam scattering
experiments. The decelerator consists of a series of alternating hexapoles and
solenoids, that effectively decouple the transverse focusing and longitudinal
deceleration properties of the decelerator. It can be operated in a
deceleration and acceleration mode, as well as in a hybrid mode that makes it
possible to guide a particle beam through the decelerator at constant speed.
The deceleration features phase stability, with a relatively large
six-dimensional phase-space acceptance. The separated focusing and deceleration
elements result in an unequal partitioning of this acceptance between the
longitudinal and transverse directions. This is ideal in scattering
experiments, which typically benefit from a large longitudinal acceptance
combined with narrow transverse distributions. We demonstrate the successful
experimental implementation of this concept using a Zeeman decelerator
consisting of an array of 25 hexapoles and 24 solenoids. The performance of the
decelerator in acceleration, deceleration and guiding modes is characterized
using beams of metastable Helium ($^3S$) atoms. Up to 60 % of the kinetic
energy was removed for He atoms that have an initial velocity of 520 m/s. The
hexapoles consist of permanent magnets, whereas the solenoids are produced from
a single hollow copper capillary through which cooling liquid is passed. The
solenoid design allows for excellent thermal properties, and enables the use of
readily available and cheap electronics components to pulse high currents
through the solenoids. The Zeeman decelerator demonstrated here is mechanically
easy to build, can be operated with cost-effective electronics, and can run at
repetition rates up to 10 Hz

uranium-uranium ($U$-$U$) collisions in its various geometrical configurations
due to their usefulness in understanding the different aspects of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). In this paper we have studied the particle production in
deformed $U$-$U$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = $193$ GeV using modified
wounded quark model (WQM). At first, we have shown the variation of
quark-nucleus inelastic scattering cross-section ($\sigma_{qA}^{in}$) with
respect to centralities for various geometrical orientations of $U$-$U$
collisions in WQM. After that we have calculated the pseudorapidity density
($dn_{ch}/d\eta$) within WQM using two-component prescription. Further we have
calculated the transverse energy density distribution ($dE_{T}/d\eta$) along
with the ratio of transverse energy to charged hadron multiplicity
($E_{T}/N_{ch}$) for $U$-$U$ collisions and compared them with the
corresponding experimental data. We have shown the scaling behavior of
$dn_{ch}/d\eta$ and $dE_{T}/d\eta$ for different initial geometry of $U$-$U$
collision with respect to $p$-$p$ data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. Furthermore
we have shown the Bjorken energy density achieved in $U$-$U$ collisions for
various configurations and compared them with experimental data of $Au$-$Au$ at
200 GeV. We observe that the present model suitably describes the experimental
data for minimum bias geometrical configuration of $U$-$U$ collisions. An
estimate for various observables in different initial geometries of $U$-$U$
collisions is also presented which will be tested in future by experimental
data.

an established technique for measuring structural and dynamical properties of
surfaces on the atomic scale. Helium beams have also been used in Fraunhofer
and Fresnel diffraction experiments. Due to the short wavelength of the atom
beams of typically 0.1nm or less, Fraunhofer diffraction experiments in
transmission have so far been limited to grating structures with a period
(pitch) of up to 200nm. However, larger periods are of interest for several
applications, for example for the characterization of photonic crystal membrane
structures, where the period is typically in the micron/high sub-micron range.
Here we present helium atom diffraction measurements of a photonic crystal
membrane structure with a two dimensional square lattice of 100x100 circular
holes. The nominal period and hole radius were 490nm and 100nm respectively. To
our knowledge this is the largest period that has ever been measured with
helium diffraction. The helium diffraction measurements are interpreted using a
model based on the helium beam characteristics. It is demonstrated how to
successfully extract values from the experimental data for the average period
of the grating, the hole diameter and the width of the virtual source used to
model the helium beam.

By introducing a domain-similarity metric for each sample, the interpolation
process is then based on a domain-informed consistency principle. We illustrate
and demonstrate the feasibility of domain-informed linear interpolation in 1D,
and also, on a real fMRI image in 2D. The results show the benefit of
incorporating domain knowledge so that, for example, sharp domain boundaries
can be recovered by the interpolation, if such information is available.

knowledge. We introduce the Dynamical Cluster Index to detect those groups of
system elements which have strong mutual interactions, named as Relevant
Subsets. Among them, we identify those which exchange most information with the
rest of the system, thus being the most influential for its dynamics. In order
to detect such Functional Dynamical Structures, we introduce another
information theoretic measure, called D-index. The experimental results make us
confident that our method can be effectively used to study both artificial and
natural complex systems.
