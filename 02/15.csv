networks of continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) ground stations provide
insight into the magmatic and tectonic processes that drive volcanic activity.
Typical analyses of spatial positions originating from each station require
careful tuning of algorithmic parameters and selection of time and spatial
regions of interest to observe possible transient events. This iterative,
manual process is tedious when attempting to make new discoveries and does not
easily scale with the number of stations. Addressing this challenge, we
introduce a novel approach based on a computer-aided discovery system that
facilitates the discovery of such potential transient events. The advantages of
this approach are demonstrated by actual detections of transient deformation
events at volcanoes selected from the Alaska Volcano Observatory database using
data recorded by GPS stations from the Plate Boundary Observatory network. Our
technique successfully reproduces the analysis of a transient signal detected
in the first half of 2008 at Akutan volcano and is also directly applicable to
3 additional volcanoes in Alaska, with the new detection of 2 previously
unnoticed inflation events: in early 2011 at Westdahl and in early 2013 at
Shishaldin. This study also discusses the benefits of our computer-aided
discovery approach for volcanology in general. Advantages include the rapid
analysis on multi-scale resolutions of transient deformation events at a large
number of sites of interest and the capability to enhance reusability and
reproducibility in volcano studies.

(continuous) physical systems is, at the very least, impractical. Hybrid models
can abstract away short transient behaviour (thus introducing discontinuities)
in order to simplify the study of such systems. For example, when modelling a
bouncing ball, the bounce can be abstracted as a discontinuous change of the
velocity, instead of resorting to the physics of the ball (de-)compression to
keep the velocity signal continuous. Impulsive differential equations can be
used to model and simulate hybrid systems such as the bouncing ball. In this
approach, the force acted on the ball by the floor is abstracted as an
infinitely large function in an infinitely small interval of time, that is, an
impulse. Current simulators cannot handle such approximations well due to the
limitations of machine precision.
  In this paper, we explore the simulation of impulsive differential equations,
where impulses are first class citizens. We present two approaches for the
simulation of impulses: symbolic and numerical. Our contribution is a
theoretically founded description of the implementation of both approaches in a
Causal Block Diagram modelling and simulation tool. Furthermore, we investigate
the conditions for which one approach is better than the other.

strongest for species with large mass and charge difference. The targets were
spherical plastic shells filled with D2 and a trace amount of Ar (0.1% or 1% by

first-shock convergence and slightly before neutron bang time, using a time-
and space-integrated spectrometer, a streaked crystal spectrometer, and two
gated multi-monochromatic x-ray imagers fielded along quasi-orthogonal lines of

reveal deviation from the initial 1% Ar gas fill and show both Ar-concentration
enhancement and depletion at different times and radial positions of the

with that of sperm cells. The main difference between the two is that, contrary
to its biological template, our artificial system does not rely on the
propagation of bending waves along the tail, at least for the range of material

  Keeping It Simple and Secure","12 pages, 7 figures, 2 algorithms, 41 references",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Security is an increasingly fundamental requirement in Software-Defined
Networking (SDN). However, the pace of adoption of secure mechanisms has been
slow, which we estimate to be a consequence of the performance overhead of
traditional solutions and of the complexity of the support infrastructure
required. As a first step to addressing these problems, we propose a modular
secure SDN control plane communications architecture, KISS, with innovative
solutions in the context of key distribution and secure channel support. A
comparative analysis of the performance impact of essential security primitives
guided our selection of basic primitives for KISS. We further propose iDVV, the
integrated device verification value, a deterministic but
indistinguishable-from-random secret code generation protocol, allowing the
local but synchronized generation/verification of keys at both ends of the
channel, even on a per-message basis. iDVV is expected to give an important
contribution both to the robustness and simplification of the authentication
and secure communication problems in SDN.
  We show that our solution, while offering the same security properties,
outperforms reference alternatives, with performance improvements up to 30%
over OpenSSL, and improvement in robustness based on a code footprint one order
of magnitude smaller. Finally, we also prove and test randomness of the
proposed algorithms.

Distributed CSIT regime, with application to decentralized wireless networks.
This regime differs from the classical limited CSIT one in that the CSIT is not
just noisy but also imperfectly shared across the transmitters (TXs). Hence,
each TX precodes data on the basis of local CSIT and statistical quality
information at other TXs. We derive the GDoF result and obtain the surprising
outcome that by specific accounting of the pathloss information, it becomes
possible for the decentralized precoded network to reach the same performance
as a genie-aided centralized network where the central node has obtained the
estimates of both TXs. The key ingredient in the scheme is the so-called
Active-Passive Zero-Forcing (AP-ZF) precoding, which lets the precoder design
adapt optimally with respect to different local CSIT qualities available at
different TXs.

Models"". A very special interesting case of this is the ""Divide and Color
Model"" (which motivates the name we use) introduced and studied by Olle
H\""aggstr\""om.
  In this generalized model, one starts with a finite or countable set $V$, a
random partition of $V$ and a parameter $p\in [0,1]$. The corresponding
Generalized Divide and Color Model is the $\{0,1\}$-valued process indexed by
$V$ obtained by independently, for each partition element in the random
partition chosen, with probability $p$, assigning all the elements of the
partition element the value 1, and with probability $1-p$, assigning all the
elements of the partition element the value 0.
  Some of the questions which we study here are the following. Under what
situations can different random partitions give rise to the same color process?
What can one say concerning exchangeable random partitions? What is the set of
product measures that a color process stochastically dominates? For random
partitions which are translation invariant, what ergodic properties do the
resulting color processes have?
  The motivation for studying these processes is twofold; on the one hand, we
believe that this is a very natural and interesting class of processes that
deserves investigation and on the other hand, a number of quite varied
well-studied processes actually fall into this class such as (1) the Ising
model, (2) the fuzzy Potts model, (3) the stationary distributions for the
Voter Model, (4) random walk in random scenery and of course (5) the original
Divide and Color Model.

potentially not differentiable or not twice differentiable on the boundary of
the feasible region. By exploiting an interior point technique, we present
first- and second-order optimality conditions for this problem that reduces to
classical ones when the derivative on the boundary is available. For this type
of problems, existing necessary conditions often rely on the notion of
subdifferential or become non-trivially weaker than the KKT condition in the
(twice-)differentiable counterpart problems. In contrast, this paper presents a
new set of first- and second-order necessary conditions that are derived
without the use of subdifferential and reduces to exactly the KKT condition
when (twice-)differentiability holds. As a result, these conditions are
stronger than some existing ones considered for the discussed minimization
problem when only non-negativity constraints are present. To solve for these
optimality conditions in the special but important case of linearly constrained
problems, we present two novel interior trust-region point algorithms and show
that their worst-case computational efficiency in achieving the potentially
stronger optimality conditions match the best known complexity bounds. Since
this work considers a more general problem than the literature, our results
also indicate that best known complexity bounds hold for a wider class of

for the solution of the many-fermion Schr\""odinger equation is here developed.
We prove an existence and uniqueness result, both in the full
infinite-dimensional amplitude space as well as for discretized versions of it.
The extended coupled-cluster method is formulated as a critical point of an
energy function using a generalization of the Rayleigh-Ritz principle: the
bivariational principle. This gives a quadratic bound for the energy error in
the discretized case. The existence and uniqueness results are proved using a
type of monotonicity property for the flipped gradient of the energy function.
Comparisons to the analysis of the standard coupled-cluster method is made, and
it is argued that the bivariational principle is a useful tool, both for
studying coupled-cluster type methods, and for developing new computational

repel each other. If mechanical work is extracted from this ring system, either
by bringing closer the rings during an attraction or by separating them as the
result of a repulsion, the energy of the rings, the only existing source of
energy in the system, decreases: $\frac{1}{2}LI_{a}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}LI_{b}^{2}$
If an energy either of attraction or repulsion is communicated to the system,
(working against the forces) its energy increases, i.e. the currents in the
rings increase. This happens because the currents existing in the rings are
free, i.e. not linked to any device which imposes a current (power supply,
constant current). Similarly, the effect of electromagnetic induction can
increase or decrease the currents with the corresponding mechanical work linked
to these developments. Not only does the current in the rings decrease as they
get closer during the attraction, but it also can be cancelled and, if the
effect continues, it may even change its direction. An application that already
exists is the levitation train. It is attracted by the rail and held on it, but
if it is very close to this due to the weight of the goods a strong repulsion
(levitation) occurs. Another application would be the accumulation of energy in
these rings, where they can spend large amounts of current, not only because of
its high critical currents but also by the fact that the magnetic flux remains
constant, cannot increase. Another advantage in this storage system is its
reversibility in the exchange of electromagnetic energy and mechanical work. In
the energy storage system, the greater the current flowing through the ring,
the greater its energy is. In order to attain this, there has been made a study
of the ideal conditions to store as much energy as possible.

  applications and its application to cluster scheduling","13 pages (11 without references)",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the performance of data-parallel workloads when
resource-constrained has significant practical importance but unfortunately has
received only limited attention. This paper identifies, quantifies and
demonstrates memory elasticity, an intrinsic property of data-parallel tasks.
Memory elasticity allows tasks to run with significantly less memory that they
would ideally want while only paying a moderate performance penalty. For
example, we find that given as little as 10% of ideal memory, PageRank and
NutchIndexing Hadoop reducers become only 1.2x/1.75x and 1.08x slower. We show
that memory elasticity is prevalent in the Hadoop, Spark, Tez and Flink
frameworks. We also show that memory elasticity is predictable in nature by
building simple models for Hadoop and extending them to Tez and Spark.
  To demonstrate the potential benefits of leveraging memory elasticity, this
paper further explores its application to cluster scheduling. In this setting,
we observe that the resource vs. time trade-off enabled by memory elasticity
becomes a task queuing time vs task runtime trade-off. Tasks may complete
faster when scheduled with less memory because their waiting time is reduced.
We show that a scheduler can turn this task-level trade-off into improved job
completion time and cluster-wide memory utilization. We have integrated memory
elasticity into Apache YARN. We show gains of up to 60% in average job
completion time on a 50-node Hadoop cluster. Extensive simulations show similar
improvements over a large number of scenarios.

(Aurora 4, CHiME 2 and CHiME 3) and assess the discriminability of the
information encoded by Gabor filterbank features. Additionally, to identify the
contribution of low, medium and high temporal modulation frequencies subsets of
the Gabor filterbank were used as features (dubbed LTM, MTM and HTM
respectively). With temporal modulation frequencies between 16 and 25 Hz, HTM
consistently outperformed the remaining ones in every condition, highlighting
the robustness of these representations against channel distortions, low

GRB\,161219B (redshift $z=0.1475$) and the associated Type Ic supernova (SN)
2016jca. GRB\,161219B had an isotropic gamma-ray energy of $\sim 1.6 \times
10^{50}$\,erg. Its afterglow is likely refreshed at an epoch preceding the
first photometric points (0.6\,d), which slows down the decay rates. Combined
analysis of the SN light curve and multiwavelength observations of the
afterglow suggest that the GRB jet was broad during the afterglow phase (full
opening angle $\sim 42^\circ \pm 3^\circ$). Our spectral series shows broad
absorption lines typical of GRB supernovae (SNe), which testify to the presence
of material with velocities up to $\sim 0.25$c. The spectrum at 3.73\,d allows
for the very early identification of a SN associated with a GRB. Reproducing it
requires a large photospheric velocity ($35,000 \pm 7000$\,\kms). The kinetic
energy of the SN is estimated through models to be \KE $\approx 4 \times
10^{52}$\,erg in spherical symmetry. The ejected mass in the explosion was \Mej
$\approx 6.5 \pm 1.5$\,\Msun, much less than that of other GRB-SNe,
demonstrating diversity among these events. The total amount of \Nifs\ in the
explosion was $0.27 \pm 0.05$\,\Msun. The observed spectra require the presence
of freshly synthesised \Nifs\ at the highest velocities, at least 3 times more
than a standard GRB-SN. We also find evidence for a decreasing \Nifs\ abundance
as a function of decreasing velocity. This suggests that SN\,2016jca was a
highly aspherical explosion viewed close to on-axis, powered by a compact
remnant. Applying a typical correction for asymmetry, the energy of SN\,2016jca
was $\sim$ (1--3) $\times 10^{52}$\,erg, confirming that most of the energy
produced by GRB-SNe goes into the kinetic energy of the SN ejecta.

disk-bearing stars suggest that additional (likely disk-free) members might
remain to be discovered. We therefore have begun a global reassessment of the
membership of Taurus-Auriga that exploits new data and better definitions of
youth and kinematic membership. As a first step, we reconsider the membership
of all disk-free candidate members from the literature with spectral type
$\ge$F0, $3^h50^m<\alpha<5^h40^m$, and $14^{\circ}<\delta<34^{\circ}$. We
combine data from the literature with Keck/HIRES and UH88/SNIFS spectra to test
the membership of these candidates using HR diagram positions, proper motions,
RVs, H$\alpha$, lithium, and surface gravity. We find 218 confirmed or likely
Taurus members, 160 confirmed or likely interlopers, and only 18 that still
lack sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. A significant fraction of
these stars (81/218=37%) are not included in the most recent canonical member
lists. Intriguingly, there are few additional members in the immediate vicinity
of the molecular clouds, preserving the IMFs that have been deemed anomalous in
past work. Many of the likely Taurus members are distributed broadly across the
search area. When combined with known disk hosts, our updated census reveals
two regimes: a high-density population with a high disk fraction (indicative of
youth) that broadly traces the molecular clouds, and a low-density population
with low disk fraction (hence likely older) that most likely represents
previous generations of star formation.

dust and shape their surrounding environment. In this paper, the Arched
Filaments in the Galactic center were studied to better understand the
influence of the Arches cluster on its nearby interstellar medium (ISM). The
Arched Filaments were observed with the Faint Object InfraRed CAMera for the
SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) at 19.7, 25.2, 31.5, and 37.1 $\mu$m.
Color-temperature maps of the region created with the 25.2 and 37.1 $\mu$m data
reveal relatively uniform dust temperatures (70-100 K) over the extent of the
filaments ($\sim 25$ pc). Distances between the cluster and the filaments were
calculated assuming equilibrium heating of standard size ISM dust grains
($\sim$0.1 $\mu$m). The distances inferred by this method are in conflict with
the projected distance between the filaments and the cluster, although this
inconsistency can be explained if the characteristic grain size in the
filaments is smaller ($\sim$0.01 $\mu$m) than typical values. DustEM models of
selected locations within the filaments show evidence of depleted abundances of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by factors of $\sim$1.6-10 by mass
compared to the diffuse ISM. The evidence for both PAH depletion and a smaller
characteristic grain size points to processing of the ISM within the filaments.
We argue that the eroding of dust grains within the filaments is not likely
attributable to the radiation or winds from the Arches cluster, but may be
related to the physical conditions in the Galactic center.

analysis in previous papers. In this work we alternatively propose a model
framework in which the instability can be computed straightforwardly as the
stable stationary solution of an asymptotic Cosserat rod description. For this
purpose, we adopt a procedure by Ribe (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A, 2004)
describing the jet dynamics with respect to a frame rotating with the a priori
unknown whipping frequency that itself becomes part of the solution. The rod
model allows for stretching, bending and torsion, taking into account inertia,
viscosity, surface tension, electric field and air drag. For the resulting
parametric boundary value problem of ordinary differential equations we present
a continuation-collocation method. On top of an implicit Runge-Kutta scheme of
fifth order, our developed continuation procedure makes the efficient and
robust simulation and navigation through a high-dimensional parameter space
possible. Despite the simplicity of the employed electric force model the
numerical results are convincing, the whipping effect is qualitatively well

effects do not appear to introduce significant errors in the determination of
SHMFs from simulations. We do not find evidence for a substructure crisis,
analogous to the missing satellite problem in the Local Group, on cluster
scales, but rather excellent agreement of the count-matched HSTFF SHMF down to
M_{sub halo}/M_{halo} ~ 10^{-5}. However, we do find discrepancies in the
radial distribution of sub haloes inferred from HSTFF cluster lenses compared
to determinations from simulated clusters. This suggests that although the
selected simulated clusters match the HSTFF sample in mass, they do not
adequately capture the dynamical properties and complex merging morphologies of
these observed cluster lenses. Therefore, HSTFF clusters are likely observed in
a transient evolutionary stage that is presently insufficiently sampled in
cosmological simulations. The abundance and mass function of dark matter
substructure in cluster lenses continues to offer an important test of the LCDM

more standard system. Here we confirm that the original DCBH hypothesis is
consistent also with the new data. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we
reproduce the new IR photometry with two models involving a Compton-thick DCBH
of mass $\approx 7 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ accreting (a) metal-free

baryon charge separation effect on the largest possible scales inevitably
occurs as a result of merely existence of the coherent axion field in early

scales of the visible Universe where the axion field $a(x)$ is coherent. A
natural outcome of this preferential evolution is that only one type of the
visible baryons remains in the system after the nuggets complete their
formation. This represents a specific mechanism on how the baryon charge
separation mechanism (when the Universe is neutral, but visible part of matter
consists the baryons only) replaces the conventional ""baryogenesis"" scenarios.

transition developing zero-energy topological Majorana bound states (MBSs) on
the wire ends. One of the promising experimental platforms in this context is a
Coulomb blockaded island, where by measuring the two-terminal conductance one
can in principle investigate the MBS properties. We theoretically study the
tunneling transport of a single electron across the superconducting Coulomb
blockaded nanowire at finite temperature to obtain the generic conductance
equation. By considering all possible scenarios where only MBSs are present at
the ends of the nanowire, we compute the nanowire conductance as a function of
the magnetic field, the temperature, and the gate voltage. In the simplest 1D
topological SC model, the oscillations of the conductance peak spacings (OCPSs)
arising from the MBSs overlap from the two wire ends manifest an increasing
oscillation amplitude with increasing magnetic field (in agreement with
theories without Coulomb blockade and in disagreement with a recent
experimental observation). We develop a generalized finite temperature master
equation theory including not only multiple subbands in the nanowire, but also
the possibility of ordinary Andreev bound states in the non-topological regime.
Inclusion of all four effects (temperature, multiple subbands, Andreev bound
states, and MBSs) provides a complete picture of the tunneling transport
properties. Based on this complete theory, we indeed obtain OCPSs whose

matter on galaxy scales are due to the displacement of dark energy by baryonic
matter, a paradigm known as emergent gravity. This formalism leads to
predictions similar to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in spherical
symmetry, but not quite identical. In particular, it leads to a well defined
transition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a
transition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first
derivative with respect to radius. Under the hypothesis of the applicability of
this transition to aspherical systems, we investigate whether it can reproduce
observed galaxy rotation curves. We conclude that the formula leads to
marginally acceptable fits with strikingly low best-fit distances, low stellar
mass-to-light ratios, and a low Hubble constant. In particular, some unobserved
wiggles are produced in rotation curves because of the dependence of the
transition on the derivative of the Newtonian acceleration, leading, even in
the most favorable case, to systematically less good fits than MOND. Then,
applying the predicted transition from emergent gravity in a regime where it
should a priori be applicable, i.e. in spherical symmetry and outside of the

we classify possible spin liquid phases with bosonic spinons and investigate
magnetically ordered phases connected to such states. It is shown, in general,
that only translationally invariant mean field states are allowed in

considerably. The mean field phase diagram of the DFT-derived spin model is
studied and it is found that possible quantum spin liquid phases are connected
to two types of magnetically ordered phases, a coplanar incommensurate $(q,0)$
spiral order as the ground state and a closely competing coplanar commensurate
$(\pi,\pi)$ spin density wave order. In addition, periodicity enhancement of

present a puzzling variability, including flares. The origin of these flares is
still debated, and often associated with a late activity of the central engine.
We discuss an alternative scenario where the central engine remains short-lived
and flares are produced by the propagation of a long-lived reverse shock in a
stratified ejecta. Here we focus on the hydrodynamics of the shock
interactions. We perform one-dimensional ultrarelativistic hydrodynamic
simulations with different initial internal structure in the gamma-ray burst
ejecta. We use them to extract bolometric light curves and compare with a
previous study based on a simplified ballistic model. We find a good agreement
between both approaches, with similar slopes and variability in the light
curves, but identify several weaknesses in the ballistic model: the density is
underestimated in the shocked regions, and more importantly, late shock
reflections are not captured. With accurate dynamics provided by our
hydrodynamic simulations, we confirm that internal shocks in the ejecta lead to
the formation of dense shells. The interaction of the long-lived reverse shock
with a dense shell then produces a fast and intense increase of the dissipated
power. Assuming that the emission is due to the synchrotron radiation from
shock-accelerated electrons, and that the external forward shock is radiatively
inefficient, we find that this results in a bright flare in the X-ray
lightcurve, with arrival times, shapes, and duration in agreement with the
observed properties of X-ray flares in GRB afterglows.

asymptotic value of the survival probability and by a bulge above the
saturation point of the von Neumann entanglement entropy and the Shannon
information entropy. In contrast, the evolution of these quantities at shorter
times reflect the level of delocalization of the initial state, but not

X-ray spectrum <10 keV is well described with a BB+PL or 2BB model during all
three outbursts. NuSTAR observations revealed a hard X-ray tail, $\Gamma=0.9$,
extending up to 79 keV, with flux larger than the one detected <10 keV. Imaging
analysis of Chandra data did not reveal small-scale extended emission around
the source. Following the outbursts, the total 0.5-10 keV flux from SGR
J1935+2154 increased in concordance to its bursting activity, with the flux at
activation onset increasing by a factor of $\sim7$ following its strongest June
2016 outburst. A Swift/XRT observation taken 1.5 days prior to the onset of
this outburst showed a flux level consistent with quiescence. We show that the
flux increase is due to the PL or hot BB component, which increased by a factor
of $25$ compared to quiescence, while the cold BB component $kT=0.47$ keV
remained more or less constant. The 2014 and 2015 outbursts decayed
quasi-exponentially with time-scales of $\sim40$ days, while the stronger May

radio emission from a magnetar, with a maximum flux density limit of 14 $\mu$Jy
for the 4.6 GHz observations and 7 $\mu$Jy for the 1.4 GHz observations. We
discuss these results in the framework of the current magnetar theoretical

parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential,
bessel-exponential, lognormal and gaussian SFHs and reject the traditional
parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the
bias and scatter of each parametrization. $15\%$ of galaxies in our CANDELS
sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction
decreasing above $M_*>10^{9.5}M_\odot$. About $40\%$ of the CANDELS galaxies

detection plays an essential role in the first stage of face processing
applications such as face recognition, face tracking, image database
management, etc. In these applications, face objects often come from an
inconsequential part of images that contain variations, namely different
illumination, poses, and occlusion. These variations can decrease face
detection rate noticeably. Most existing face detection approaches are not
accurate, as they have not been able to resolve unstructured images due to
large appearance variations and can only detect human faces under one
particular variation. Existing frameworks of face detection need enhancements
to detect human faces under the stated variations to improve detection rate and
reduce detection time. In this study, an enhanced face detection framework is
proposed to improve detection rate based on skin color and provide a validation
process. A preliminary segmentation of the input images based on skin color can
significantly reduce search space and accelerate the process of human face
detection. The primary detection is based on Haar-like features and the
Adaboost algorithm. A validation process is introduced to reject non-face
objects, which might occur during the face detection process. The validation
process is based on two-stage Extended Local Binary Patterns. The experimental
results on the CMU-MIT and Caltech 10000 datasets over a wide range of facial
variations in different colors, positions, scales, and lighting conditions
indicated a successful face detection rate.

the exact equations for irrotational water waves in a non-vibrating fluid. The
other two models describe long waves. These models are obtained under two
different assumptions about the amplitude of the vibration. Surprisingly, the
governing equations have exactly the same form in both cases (up to

dispersionless shallow-water equations if the vibration is absent, and the
vibration manifests itself via an additional term which makes the equations
dispersive and, for small-amplitude waves, is similar to the term that would
appear if surface tension were taken into account. We show that our dispersive

for the need of not only high level of electronic correlation treatment, namely
local coupled cluster with single and double excitation operators and
perturbative treatment of triple excitations [LCCSD(T)], but also
extrapolations to the complete basis to produce reliable and accurate
thermodynamics data. Solvation enthalpies were computed with the conductor like
screening model for real solvents [COSMO-RS], for which we observe errors not
exceeding 22 kJ mol$^{-1}$. We thus propose with final uncertainty of about 20
kJ mol$^{-1}$ standard enthalpies of formation of TBP, HDBP, and H$_2$MBP which

a timescale of about 5 Myr. Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc
dissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an
ambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted
by the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no
azimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a
theoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of
the disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density
and velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing
hydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with
different velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate
description of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the
disc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected
trend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing
to continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a
physical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model
predictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical
viscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our
model can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on
accretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc
can be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs
can shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas
of the order of their initial mass. This process could be relevant for planet
formation in dense environments.

improvements, such as many-to-all correlator with grid source and low-mode
substitution in the connected insertion and low-mode average in the quark loop
can make the overlap as efficient as the twisted-mass and clover fermions in
calculating the three-point functions. It is more efficient than the DWF. When
the multi-mass feature is invoked, the overlap can be more efficient in

neighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a
massive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring
material spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring
with an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the
Roche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites,
including tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation
factor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons
into mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends
outward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively
slow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis
distribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.
We estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary
impactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive
a mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and
Rhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content.
This suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of
rock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more
rock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the
current inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors

incorporating discrete actions inside DDP: we first optimize continuous
mixtures of discrete actions, and, subsequently force the mixtures into fully

Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells

datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly
reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic
recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample
independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent

models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding
model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to
outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated
measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric
approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our
method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new
longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine
against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all
other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the

applications in different domains. Known as a set of NP-hard problems, they
have different vari- ations and many heuristics have been proposed for
obtaining approximate solutions. Specifically, for the 1D variable sized bin
packing problem, the two key sets of optimization heuristics are the bin
assignment and the bin allocation. Usually the performance of a single static
optimization heuristic can not beat that of a dynamic one which is tailored for
each bin packing instance. Building such an adaptive system requires modeling
the relationship between bin features and packing perform profiles. The primary
drawbacks of traditional AI machine learnings for this task are the natural
limitations of feature engineering, such as the curse of dimensionality and
feature selection quality. We introduce a deep learning approach to overcome
the drawbacks by applying a large training data set, auto feature selection and
fast, accurate labeling. We show in this paper how to build such a system by
both theoretical formulation and engineering practices. Our prediction system
achieves up to 89% training accuracy and 72% validation accuracy to select the
best heuristic that can generate a better quality bin packing solution.

$\Gamma=1.43^{+0.23}_{-0.13}$, with no clear spectral variations. The
\hbox{X-ray} and multi-wavelength properties effectively rule out the vast
majority of previously observed high-energy transients. A few theoretical
possibilities remain: an ""orphan"" X-ray afterglow from an off-axis

low-luminosity GRB at high redshift with no prompt emission below $\sim$20 keV

intermediate-mass black hole and a white dwarf with little variability.
However, none of the above scenarios can completely explain all observed
properties. Although large uncertainties exist, the implied rate of such events
is comparable to those of orphan and low-luminosity GRBs as well as rare TDEs,
implying the discovery of an untapped regime for a known transient class, or a
new type of variable phenomena whose nature remains to be determined.

polymerization of acetylene and hydrogen cyanide induced by ultraviolet photons
can drive the formation of linear carbon chains of increasing length. We have
used ALMA to map the emission of 3 mm rotational lines of the hydrocarbon
radicals C2H, C4H, and C6H, and the CN-containing species CN, C3N, HC3N, and
HC5N with an angular resolution of 1"". The spatial distribution of all these
species is a hollow, 5-10"" wide, spherical shell located at a radius of 10-20""
from the star, with no appreciable emission close to the star. Our observations
resolve the broad shell of carbon chains into thinner sub-shells which are 1-2""
wide and not fully concentric, indicating that the mass loss process has been
discontinuous and not fully isotropic. The radial distributions of the species
mapped reveal subtle differences: while the hydrocarbon radicals have very
similar radial distributions, the CN-containing species show more diverse
distributions, with HC3N appearing earlier in the expansion and the radical CN
extending later than the rest of the species. The observed morphology can be
rationalized by a chemical model in which the growth of polyynes is mainly
produced by rapid gas-phase chemical reactions of C2H and C4H radicals with
unsaturated hydrocarbons, while cyanopolyynes are mainly formed from polyynes
in gas-phase reactions with CN and C3N radicals.

is its near-universality in the Milky Way (MW), which provides a powerful way
to constrain different star formation models that predict the IMF. However,
those models are almost universally ""cloud-scale"" or smaller -- they take as
input or simulate single molecular clouds (GMCs), clumps, or cores, and predict
the resulting IMF as a function of the cloud properties. Without a model for
the progenitor properties of all clouds which formed the stars at different
locations in the MW (including ancient stellar populations formed in
high-redshift, likely gas-rich dwarf progenitor galaxies that looked little
like the Galaxy today), the predictions cannot be fully explored, nor safely
applied to ""live"" cosmological calculations of the IMF in different galaxies at
different cosmological times. We therefore combine a suite of high-resolution
cosmological simulations (from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project),
which form MW-like galaxies with reasonable star formation properties and
explicitly resolve massive GMCs, with various proposed cloud-scale IMF models.
We apply the models independently to every star particle formed in the
simulations to synthesize the predicted IMF in the present-day galaxy. We
explore models where the IMF depends on Jeans mass, sonic or turbulent
Bonner-Ebert mass, fragmentation with a polytropic equation-of-state, or where
it is self-regulated by protostellar feedback. We show that all of these
models, except the feedback-regulated ones, predict far more variation ($\sim
0.6-1$ dex $1\,\sigma$ scatter in the IMF turnover mass) in the simulations
than is observed in the MW.

graph on vertex set $\{1, ..., t\}^n$ such that two vertices $x, y \in \{1,
..., t\}^n$ are connected if and only if $x_i \neq y_i$ for all $i \in \{1,
..., n\}$. Let the density of a subset $S$ of $K_t^n$ to be $\mu(S) :=
\frac{|S|}{t^n}$, and let the vertex boundary of a set $S$ to be vertices which
are incident to some vertex of $S$, perhaps including points of $S$. We
investigate two similar problems on such graphs.
  First, we study the vertex isoperimetry problem. Given a density $\nu \in [0,
1]$ what is the smallest possible density of the vertex boundary of a subset of
$K_t^n$ of density $\nu$? Let $\Phi_t(\nu)$ be the infimum of these minimum
densities as $n \to \infty$. We find a recursive relation allows one to compute
$\Phi_t(\nu)$ in time polynomial to the number of desired bits of precision.
  Second, we study given an independent set $I \subseteq K_t^n$ of density
$\mu(I) = \frac{1}{t}(1-\epsilon)$, how close it is to a maximum-sized
independent set $J$ of density $\frac{1}{t}$. We show that this deviation
(measured by $\mu(I \setminus J)$) is at most $4\epsilon^{\frac{\log t}{\log t
- \log(t-1)}}$ as long as $\epsilon < 1 - \frac{3}{t} + \frac{2}{t^2}$. This
substantially improves on results of Alon, Dinur, Friedgut, and Sudakov (2004)

observed in experiments when temperature increases from 2K to 300K,
electron-photon scattering decoherence has been added to the simulation,

since training images are not always explicitly-labeled. For instance, face
images of two persons in a news photo are not explicitly labeled by their names
in the caption. We propose a Matrix Completion for Ambiguity Resolution (MCar)
method for predicting the actual labels from ambiguously labeled images. This
step is followed by learning a standard supervised classifier from the
disambiguated labels to classify new images. To prevent the majority labels
from dominating the result of MCar, we generalize MCar to a weighted MCar
(WMCar) that handles label imbalance. Since WMCar outputs a soft labeling
vector of reduced ambiguity for each instance, we can iteratively refine it by
feeding it as the input to WMCar. Nevertheless, such an iterative
implementation can be affected by the noisy soft labeling vectors, and thus the
performance may degrade. Our proposed Iterative Candidate Elimination (ICE)
procedure makes the iterative ambiguity resolution possible by gradually
eliminating a portion of least likely candidates in ambiguously labeled face.
We further extend MCar to incorporate the labeling constraints between
instances when such prior knowledge is available. Compared to existing methods,
our approach demonstrates improvement on several ambiguously labeled datasets.

extracting quality phrases from a text corpus. Phrase mining is important in
various tasks such as information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction,

analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of
new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. Recently, a few
data-driven methods have been developed successfully for extraction of phrases
from massive domain-specific text. However, none of the state-of-the-art models
is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or
labeling phrases.
  Since one can easily obtain many quality phrases from public knowledge bases
to a scale that is much larger than that produced by human experts, in this
paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase,
which leverages this large amount of high-quality phrases in an effective way
and achieves better performance compared to limited human labeled phrases. In
addition, we develop a POS-guided phrasal segmentation model, which
incorporates the shallow syntactic information in part-of-speech (POS) tags to
further enhance the performance, when a POS tagger is available. Note that,
AutoPhrase can support any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g.,

requiring, a POS tagger. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the new
method has shown significant improvements in effectiveness on five real-world

weighted least squares method for evaluating the output weights, and the input

a set of inequality constrains. The kernel density estimation (KDE) method is
employed to set the penalty weights for each training samples, so that some

updating a RSCN model with improved penalty weights computed from the kernel

  Minimization based on Group Sparse Representation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.08983",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rank minimization methods have attracted considerable interest in various
areas, such as computer vision and machine learning. The most representative
work is nuclear norm minimization (NNM), which can recover the matrix rank
exactly under some restricted and theoretical guarantee conditions. However,
for many real applications, NNM is not able to approximate the matrix rank
accurately, since it often tends to over-shrink the rank components. To rectify
the weakness of NNM, recent advances have shown that weighted nuclear norm
minimization (WNNM) can achieve a better matrix rank approximation than NNM,
which heuristically set the weight being inverse to the singular values.
However, it still lacks a sound mathematical explanation on why WNNM is more
feasible than NNM. In this paper, we propose a scheme to analyze WNNM and NNM
from the perspective of the group sparse representation. Specifically, we
design an adaptive dictionary to bridge the gap between the group sparse
representation and the rank minimization models. Based on this scheme, we
provide a mathematical derivation to explain why WNNM is more feasible than
NNM. Moreover, due to the heuristical set of the weight, WNNM sometimes pops
out error in the operation of SVD, and thus we present an adaptive weight
setting scheme to avoid this error. We then employ the proposed scheme on two
low-level vision tasks including image denoising and image inpainting.
Experimental results demonstrate that WNNM is more feasible than NNM and the
proposed scheme outperforms many current state-of-the-art methods.

  Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's

  This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute
smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software
transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel,
allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and ""discovering"" a
serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is
captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to
re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.
  Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of

measurement of the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the electric-field
amplitude of a linearly-polarized pulsed RF electric field at $\sim 25.6\,$GHz
and its angle with respect to a static electric field. The measurements exploit
coherent population transfer between the $35$s and $35$p Rydberg states of
helium atoms in a pulsed supersonic beam. Based on this experimental result, we
develop a general framework in the form of a set of equations relating the five
independent polarization parameters of a coherently oscillating field in a
fixed laboratory frame to Rabi rates of transitions between a ground and three
excited states of an atom with arbitrary quantization axis. We then explain how
these equations can be used to fully characterize the polarization in a minimum

knowing the polarization of the driving field, to determine the orientation of
the static field using two measurements. The presented technique is not limited

It is then applied to mm-wave ad hoc and cellular networks, where two

more insights on the role of directional antenna arrays in mm-wave networks. In

trajectories when the long wavelength midinfrared driving field is used. Using
the semiclassical trajectory model, we have revealed the two-dimensional
manipulation of the electron-ion recollision process, which agrees well with
the time frequency analysis. By filtering these humps, intense isolated
attosecond pulses are directly generated without any phase compensation. Our
proposal provides a simple technique to generate intense isolated attosecond
pulses with various central photon energies covering the multi-keV spectral
regime by using multicycle driving pulses with high pump energy in experiment.

responsible for regulating star-formation in AGN host galaxies. However, the
relationships between AGN activity, radiation, winds, and star-formation are
complex and still far from being understood. We study scaling relations between
AGN properties, host galaxy properties and AGN winds. We then evaluate the wind
mean impact on the global star-formation history, taking into account the short
AGN duty cycle with respect to that of star-formation. We first collect AGN
wind observations for 94 AGN with detected massive winds at sub-pc to kpc
spatial scales. We then fold AGN wind scaling relations with AGN luminosity
functions, to evaluate the average AGN wind mass-loading factor as a function
of cosmic time. We find strong correlations between the AGN molecular and
ionised wind mass outflow rates and the AGN bolometric luminosity. The power
law scaling is steeper for ionised winds (slope 1.29+/-0.38) than for molecular
winds (0.76+/-0.06), meaning that the two rates converge at high bolometric
luminosities. The molecular gas depletion timescale and the molecular gas
fraction of galaxies hosting powerful AGN winds are 3-10 times shorter and
smaller than those of main-sequence galaxies with similar SFR, stellar mass and
redshift. These findings suggest that, at high AGN bolometric luminosity, the
reduced molecular gas fraction may be due to the destruction of molecules by
the wind, leading to a larger fraction of gas in the atomic ionised phase. The
AGN wind mass-loading factor $\eta=\dot M_{OF}/SFR$ is systematically higher
than that of starburst driven winds. Our analysis shows that AGN winds are, on
average, powerful enough to clean galaxies from their molecular gas only in
massive systems at z<=2, i.e. a strong form of co-evolution between SMBHs and
galaxies appears to break down for the least massive galaxies.

consider systematic and numerical artifacts such as shot noise, galaxy bias,
and finite pixel effects. We model the systematics using a Hermite polynomial
expansion and perform a comprehensive analysis of known effects on the
two-dimensional genus, with a view toward using the statistic for cosmological
parameter estimation. We find that the finite pixel effect is dominated by an
amplitude drop and can be made less than $1\%$ by adopting pixels smaller than
$1/3$ of the angular smoothing length. Nonlinear gravitational evolution
introduces time-dependent coefficients of the zeroth, first, and second Hermite
polynomials, but the genus amplitude changes by less than $1\%$ between $z=1$
and $z=0$ for smoothing scales $R_{\rm G} > 9 {\rm Mpc/h}$. Non-zero terms are
measured up to third order in the Hermite polynomial expansion when studying
RSD. Differences in shapes of the genus curves in real and redshift space are
small when we adopt thick redshift shells, but the amplitude change remains a
significant $\sim {\cal O}(10\%)$ effect. The combined effects of galaxy
biasing and shot noise produce systematic effects up to the second Hermite
polynomial. It is shown that, when sampling, the use of galaxy mass cuts
significantly reduces the effect of shot noise relative to random sampling.

eccentric orbit (e ~ 0.03), and a systemic velocity discrepant from the mean of
Taurus-Auriga. The photometry shows quasi-periodic variations on a different,

eclipses are seen. The visible object is a rapidly rotating (vsini ~ 25 km/s)
early K star, which along with the rotation period implies it must be large (R
> 26.3 Rsun), as suggested also by spectroscopic estimates indicating a low
surface gravity. The parallax from the Gaia mission and other independent
estimates imply a distance much greater than the Taurus-Auriga region,
consistent with the giant interpretation. Taken together, this evidence
together with a re-evaluation of the LiI~$\lambda$6707 and H$\alpha$ lines
shows that V501 Aur is not a T-Tauri star, but is instead a field binary with a
giant primary far behind the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. The large mass
function from the spectroscopic orbit and a comparison with stellar evolution

alternative models such as Fokker-Planck diffusion is not less convincing,
movement of populations is commonly modelled using the diffusion law due to
Fick. It is an interesting feature of Fokker-Planck diffusion that for
spatially varying diffusion coefficients the stationary solution is not a
homogeneous distribution; in contrast to Fickian diffusion. Instead,
concentration accumulates in regions of low diffusivity and tends to lower
levels for areas of high diffusivity. Thus, we may interpret the stationary
distribution of the Fokker-Planck diffusion as a reflection of different levels
of habitat quality. Moreover, the most common model for environmental
fluctuations, linear multiplicative noise, is based on the assumption that
individuals respond independently to stochastic environmental fluctuations. For
large population densities the assumption of independence is debatable and the
model further implies that noise intensities can increase to arbitrarily high
levels. Therefore, instead of the commonly used linear multiplicative noise
model, we implement environmental variability by an alternative nonlinear noise
term which never exceeds a certain maximum noise intensity. With Fokker-Planck
diffusion and the nonlinear noise model replacing the classical approaches we
investigate a simple invasive system based on the Lotka-Volterra competition
model. We observe that the heterogeneous stationary distribution generated by
Fokker-Planck diffusion generally facilitates the formation of segregated
habitats of resident and invader. However, this segregation can be broken by
nonlinear noise leading to coexistence of resident and invader across the whole
spatial domain.

challenging to nowcast storm initiation and growth, due to the limitations of

multi-channel 3D-cube successive convolution network (3D-SCN). As real-time
re-analysis meteorological data can now provide valuable atmospheric boundary
layer thermal dynamic information, which is essential to predict storm
initiation and growth, both raw 3D radar and re-analysis data are used directly
without any handcraft feature engineering. These data are formulated as
multi-channel 3D cubes, to be fed into our network, which are convolved by
cross-channel 3D convolutions. By stacking successive convolutional layers
without pooling, we build an end-to-end trainable model for nowcasting.
Experimental results show that deep learning methods achieve better performance
than traditional extrapolation methods. The qualitative analyses of 3D-SCN show
encouraging results of nowcasting of storm initiation, growth, and advection.

of the immediate token history. Recently, various methods for augmenting neural
language models with an attention mechanism over a differentiable memory have
been proposed. For predicting the next token, these models query information
from a memory of the recent history which can facilitate learning mid- and
long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention mechanisms used in
memory-augmented neural language models produce a single output vector per time
step. This vector is used both for predicting the next token as well as for the
key and value of a differentiable memory of a token history. In this paper, we
propose a neural language model with a key-value attention mechanism that
outputs separate representations for the key and value of a differentiable
memory, as well as for encoding the next-word distribution. This model
outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora.
Yet, we found that our method mainly utilizes a memory of the five most recent
output representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much
simpler model based only on the concatenation of recent output representations
from previous time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented
neural language models.

surprising features. Here we reveal such features in three different types of

density being affected by a scalar field. In the three cases different {\it

rotation around a vertical axis, and (iii) a second stabilizing scalar field.
Despite the very different nature of the stabilizing forces and the
corresponding equations of motion, at moderate strength we counterintuitively
but consistently observe an {\it enhancement} in the flux, even though the flow
motion is weaker than the original RB flow. The flux enhancement occurs in an
intermediate regime in which the stabilizing force is strong enough to alter
the flow structures in the bulk to a more organised morphology, yet not too
strong to severely suppress the flow motions. Near the optimal transport
enhancements all three systems exhibit a transition from a state in which the
thermal boundary layer (BL) is nested inside the momentum BL to the one with
the thermal BL being thicker than the momentum BL.

deposition phenomena at the solid-liquid interface of a porous medium have to
be represented by macroscopic reaction source terms. The effective rates can be
computed, in the case of periodic media, from three-dimensional microscopic
simulations of the periodic cell. Several computational and semi-analytical
models have been studied in the field of colloid filtration to describe this
problem. They often rely on effective deposition rates defined by simple linear
reaction ODEs, neglecting the advection-diffusion interplay, and assuming slow
reactions. Therefore, when these rates are inserted into general macroscopic
transport equations, they can lead to conceptual inconsistencies and,
therefore, often qualitatively wrong results. In this work, we study the
upscaling of Brownian deposition on face-centred spherical arrangements using a
linear effective reaction rate, defined by volume averaging, and a macroscopic
advection-diffusion-reaction equation. The case of partial deposition, defined
by an attachment probability, is studied and the limit of ideal deposition is
retrieved as a particular case. We make use of a particularly convenient
computational setup that allows the direct computation of the asymptotic
stationary value of effective rates. This allows to drastically reduce the
computational domain down to the scale of the single repeating periodic unit:
the savings are ever more noticeable in the case of higher Peclet numbers, when
larger physical times are needed to reach the asymptotic regime, and thus,
equivalently, a much larger computational domain and simulation time would be
needed in a traditional setup. We show how this new definition of deposition
rate is more robust and extendable to the whole range of P\'eclet numbers; it
also is consistent with the classical heat and mass transfer literature.

does exist and can effectively be found. Actually it is defined by a quadratic
form. As a result we get a nonlinear Lax pair consisting of the linearized
equation and the invariant manifold. Our second step consists of finding an
appropriate change of the variables to linearize the found nonlinear Lax pair.
The desired change of the variables is again defined by a quadratic form. The
method is illustrated by the well-known KdV equation and the modified Volterra
chain. New Lax pairs are found. The formal asymptotic expansions for their
eigenfunctions are constructed around the singular values of the spectral
parameter. By applying the method of the formal diagonalization to these Lax

gap changes as large as 0.6 eV with thickness in some instances. This does not

van der Waals interactions. Mapping onto a tight binding model allows us to
quantify the electronic structure changes which are found to be dictated solely
by interlayer hopping interactions. Different environments that an atom
encounters could change the Madelung potential and therefore the onsite
energies. This could happen while going from monolayer to bilayer as well as in
cases where the stackings are different from what is found in 2H structures.
These effects are quantitatively found to be negligible, enabling us to
quantify the thickness dependent electronic structure changes as arising from

at a specific equilibrium distance depending on its size and deformability. We
find that this equilibrium distance is nearly independent of the channel
Reynolds number and falls on a single master curve when plotted versus the

In contrast, the actual deformation of a capsule strongly depends on the
Reynolds number. The lift-force profiles behave in a similar manner as those
for rigid particles. Using the Saffman effect, the capsule's equilibrium
position can be controlled by an external force along the channel axis. While
rigid particles move to the center when slowed down, very soft capsules show
the opposite behavior. Interestingly, for a specific control force particles

ksec) Chandra HETG observation of the changing look AGN NGC7582. During this
observation NGC7582 was in a highly obscured state. Therefore, we considered
also a short Suzaku observation, which caught NGC7582 in a Compton thick state.
This allows us to determine the underlying continuum and the amount of
absorption ($N_H \sim~1.2\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). A wealth of emission lines
are detected in the Chandra data, which allow us to map the structure of the
circum-nuclear emitters. The high resolution spectrum reveals that the soft
X-ray emission originates in a hybrid gas, which is ionized in part by the
starforming activity and in part by the central AGN. The high resolution images
confirm that the emitting region is inhomogeneous and extends up to a few
hundred pc from the nuclear source. The X-ray images are more extended in the
lower energy lines (Ne and Mg) than in the higher energy lines (Si, Fe), where
the former are dominated by the collisionally ionised gas and the latter by the
photoionized AGN emission. This is supported by the analysis of the He-like
triplets. We deduce that a low density photoionized gas is responsible for the
strong forbidden components, which is likely to originate from extended AGN
Narrow Line Region gas at distances of 200-300 pc from the black hole. We also
detected an absorption feature at ~ 6.7 keV consistent with the rest frame
energy of the resonance absorption line from FeXXV, which traces the presence
of a sub-parsec scale ionized absorber. The emerging picture is in agreement
with our view of the circumnuclear gas in AGN, where the medium is clumpy and
stratified in both density and ionization. These absorbers and emitters are
located on different scales: from the sub-pc Broad Line Region gas out to the
kpc scale of the galactic absorber.

dynamical nature, continues to remain unknown. With the advent of high
precision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the
kinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation
scenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish
whether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the
kinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics
of distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach
for analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos
stars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars
from the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1,
covering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the
spatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the
probability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the
systematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is
used to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions
from both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby
OB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more
distant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not. The kinematics of our sample of young
OB stars suggests that systematic vertical motions in the disk cannot be
explained by a simple model of a stable long-lived warp. The Galactic warp may
either be a transient feature, or additional phenomena are acting on the
gaseous component of the Milky Way, causing systematic vertical motions that
are masking the expected warp signal. A larger and deeper sample of stars with
Gaia astrometry will be needed to constrain the dynamical nature of the
Galactic warp.

  Registration","12 pages, 11 figures",,"10.1109/TIP.2017.2776753",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image registration is a fundamental issue in multispectral image processing.
In filter wheel based multispectral imaging systems, the non-coplanar placement
of the filters always causes the misalignment of multiple channel images. The
selective characteristic of spectral response in multispectral imaging raises
two challenges to image registration. First, the intensity levels of a local
region may be different in individual channel images. Second, the local
intensity may vary rapidly in some channel images while keeps stationary in
others. Conventional multimodal measures, such as mutual information,
correlation coefficient, and correlation ratio, can register images with
different regional intensity levels, but will fail in the circumstance of
severe local intensity variation. In this paper, a new measure, namely
normalized total gradient (NTG), is proposed for multispectral image
registration. The NTG is applied on the difference between two channel images.
This measure is based on the key assumption (observation) that the gradient of
difference image between two aligned channel images is sparser than that
between two misaligned ones. A registration framework, which incorporates image
pyramid and global/local optimization, is further introduced for rigid
transform. Experimental results validate that the proposed method is effective
for multispectral image registration and performs better than conventional
methods.

circumstellar extinction throughout the RSG lifetime, meaning the most evolved

without defining clearly what kind of clusters we expect we will not be able to
construct a valid axiomatic system. In particular we look at the shape and the
gaps between the clusters. Finally we demonstrate that there exist several ways
to reconcile the formulation of the axioms with their intended meaning and that
under this reformulation the axioms stop to be contradictory and the real-world
$k$-means algorithm conforms to this axiomatic system.

droplets, cells, or bubbles is a phenomenon with many natural and technological
occurrences. For an object facing the front, it may yield various fates, from
trapping to rejection, with large implications regarding the solidification
pattern. However, whereas most situations involve multiple particles
interacting with each other and the front, attention has focused almost
exclusively on the interaction of a single, isolated object with the front.
Here we address experimentally the interaction of multiple particles with a
solidification front by performing solidification experiments of a monodisperse
particle suspension in a Hele-Shaw cell, with precise control of growth
conditions and real-time visualization. We evidence the growth of a particle
layer ahead of the front at a close-packing volume fraction and we document its
steady state value at various solidification velocities. We then extend single
particle models to the situation of multiple particles by taking into account
the additional force induced on an entering particle by viscous friction in the
compacted particle layer. By a force balance model, this provides an indirect
measure of the repelling mean thermomolecular pressure over a particle entering
the front. The presence of multiple particles is found to increase it following
a reduction of the thickness of the thin liquid film that separates particles
and front. We anticipate the findings reported here to provide a relevant basis
to understand many complex solidification situations in geophysics,
engineering, biology, or food engineering, where multiple objects interact with
the front and control the resulting solidification patterns.

the CDW behavior is induced by charge disproportionation at the Bi site. At
ambient pressure, this compound is a charge-ordered insulator, but little is
known about its high-pressure behavior. In this work, we study from
first-principles the high-pressure phase diagram of BaBiO3 using phonon modes
analysis and evolutionary crystal structure prediction. We show that charge
disproportionation is very robust in this compound and persists up to 100 GPa.
This causes the system to remain insulating up to the highest pressure we
studied.

to an axisymmetric metric, in 2+1 spacetime dimensions with cosmological
constant $\Lambda<0$, for $m=0,1,2$, for four 1-parameter families of initial

curvature as a power of $|p-p_*|$, where $p$ is the amplitude of our initial
data and $p_*$ some threshold. We find evidence of Ricci scaling for all
families, and tentative evidence of mass scaling for most families, but the
case $m>0$ is very different from the case $m=0$ we have considered before: the
thresholds for mass scaling and Ricci scaling are significantly different (for
the same family), scaling stops well above the scale set by $\Lambda$, and the
exponents depend strongly on the family. Hence, in contrast to the $m=0$ case,
and to many other self-gravitating systems, there is only weak evidence for the
collapse threshold being controlled by a self-similar critical solution and no
evidence for it being universal.

  Methods with High Linear Order",,,"10.1063/1.4992752",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When evolving in time the solution of a hyperbolic partial differential
equation, it is often desirable to use high order strong stability preserving
(SSP) time discretizations. These time discretizations preserve the
monotonicity properties satisfied by the spatial discretization when coupled
with the first order forward Euler, under a certain time-step restriction.
While the allowable time-step depends on both the spatial and temporal
discretizations, the contribution of the temporal discretization can be
isolated by taking the ratio of the allowable time-step of the high order
method to the forward Euler time-step. This ratio is called the strong
stability coefficient. The search for high order strong stability time-stepping
methods with high order and large allowable time-step had been an active area
of research. It is known that implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods exist only up to
sixth order. However, if we restrict ourselves to solving only linear
autonomous problems, the order conditions simplify and we can find implicit SSP
Runge-Kutta methods of any linear order. In the current work we aim to find
very high linear order implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods that are optimal in
terms of allowable time-step. Next, we formulate an optimization problem for
implicit-explicit (IMEX) SSP Runge-Kutta methods and find implicit methods with
large linear stability regions that pair with known explicit SSP Runge-Kutta
methods of orders plin=3,4,6 as well as optimized IMEX SSP Runge-Kutta pairs
that have high linear order and nonlinear orders p=2,3,4. These methods are
then tested on sample problems to verify order of convergence and to
demonstrate the sharpness of the SSP coefficient and the typical behavior of
these methods on test problems.

Agency mission LISA Pathfinder. Detailed measurements of the charge-induced
electrostatic forces exerted on free-falling test masses (TMs) inside the
capacitive gravitational reference sensor are the first made in a relevant

combination of charge control and electric-field compensation, we show that the
level of charge-induced acceleration noise on a single TM can be maintained at
a level close to 1.0 fm/s^2/sqrt(Hz) across the 0.1-100 mHz frequency band that
is crucial to an observatory such as LISA. Using dedicated measurements that
detect these effects in the differential acceleration between the two test
masses, we resolve the stochastic nature of the TM charge build up due to
interplanetary cosmic rays and the TM charge-to-force coupling through stray
electric fields in the sensor. All our measurements are in good agreement with
predictions based on a relatively simple electrostatic model of the LISA

by an electron and has been used to probe the electron momentum distribution in
gas-phase and condensed-matter samples. In the low x-ray intensity regime,
Compton scattering from atoms dominantly comes from bound electrons in neutral
atoms, neglecting contributions from bound electrons in ions and free (ionized)
electrons. In contrast, in the high x-ray intensity regime, the sample
experiences severe ionization via x-ray multiphoton multiple ionization
dynamics. Thus, it becomes necessary to take into account all the contributions
to the Compton scattering signal when atoms are exposed to high-intensity x-ray
pulses provided by x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). In this paper, we
investigate the Compton spectra of atoms at high x-ray intensity, using an
extension of the integrated x-ray atomic physics toolkit, \textsc{xatom}. As
the x-ray fluence increases, there is a significant contribution from ionized
electrons to the Compton spectra, which gives rise to strong deviations from
the Compton spectra of neutral atoms. The present study provides not only
understanding of the fundamental XFEL--matter interaction but also crucial
information for single-particle imaging experiments, where Compton scattering
is no longer negligible.

variances, respectively. The motivation for this is that the implementation of
these methods leads to different and contradictory results, making the
variability classification of the light curves of a certain source dependent on
the statistics implemented.
  For this purpose, we re-analyse the results on an AGN sample observed along
several sessions with the 2.15m ""Jorge Sahade"" telescope (CASLEO), San Juan,

state of these light curves and in an attempt to find the suitable statistical
methodology to study photometric (micro)variations. We conclude that, although

transform and taking inverse steps (in the analogues of the classical
procedures used for, e.g., the heat or Laplace equations), we deduce the
initial and final value problems satisfied by the new convolution integrals.

  Simulations of Highway Scenarios","12 pages, 13 figures, Preprint; submitted to IEEE Transactions on
  Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shadowing from vehicles can significantly degrade the performance of
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in multilink systems, e.g., vehicular
ad-hoc networks (VANETs). It is thus important to characterize and model the
influence of common shadowing objects like cars properly when designing these
VANETs. Despite the fact that for multilink systems it is essential to model
the joint effects on the different links, the multilink shadowing effects of
V2V channels on VANET simulations are not yet well understood. In this paper we
present a measurement based analysis of multilink shadowing effects in a V2V
communication system with cars as blocking objects. In particular we analyze,
characterize and model the large scale fading, both regarding the
autocorrelation and the joint multilink cross-correlation process, for
communication at 5.9 GHz between four cars in a highway convoy scenario. The
results show that it is essential to separate the instantaneous propagation
condition into line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed LOS (OLOS), by other cars,
and then apply an appropriate pathloss model for each of the two cases. The
choice of the pathloss model not only influences the autocorrelation but also
changes the cross-correlation of the large scale fading process between
different links. By this, we conclude that it is important that VANET
simulators should use geometry based models, that distinguish between LOS and
OLOS communication. Otherwise, the VANET simulators need to consider the
cross-correlation between different communication links to achieve results
close to reality.

partial differential equations in one unknown. Our approach relies on
Bour-Mayer method to determine compatibility conditions via Jacobi-Mayer
brackets. We solve compatible systems recursively by imitating what one would
do with pen and paper: Solve one equation, substitute the solution into the
remaining equations and iterate the process until the equations of the system
are exhausted. The method we employ for assessing the consistency of the
underlying system differs from the traditional use of differential Gr\""obner
bases yet seems more efficient and straightforward to implement. We are not
aware of a computer algebra system that adopts the procedure we advocate in
this work.
