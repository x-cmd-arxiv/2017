formulated on asymptotically AdS spacetimes might provide for gravity duals of
a broad class of CFTs. For simplicity we focus on five dimensions. We show that
this theory fulfils a Birkhoff's Theorem as it is the case in Lovelock gravity
and therefore, for generic values of the couplings, there is no s-wave
propagating mode. We prove that the spherically symmetric solution is
determined by a quintic algebraic polynomial equation which resembles Wheeler's
polynomial of Lovelock gravity. For the black hole solutions we compute the
temperature, mass and entropy and show that the first law of black holes
thermodynamics is fulfilled. Besides of being of fourth order in general, we
show that the field equations, when linearized around AdS are of second order,
and therefore the theory does not propagate ghosts around this background.

labels from $D=\{0,1\}$ and an optimal assignment is required to use both
labels from $D$. Examples include the classical global Min-Cut problem in
graphs and the Minimum Distance problem studied in coding theory.
  We establish a dichotomy theorem and thus give a complete complexity
classification of Boolean surjective VCSPs with respect to exact solvability.
Our work generalises the dichotomy for $\{0,\infty\}$-valued constraint
languages (corresponding to surjective decision CSPs) obtained by Creignou and
H\'ebrard. For the maximisation problem of $\mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0}$-valued

novel tractable class of languages that is trivial in the non-surjective

structure related to downsets and upsets. Our main contribution is identifying

expected time to occurrence of an event of interest (e.g., death or relapse of
cancer). We leverage semiparametric efficiency theory to construct estimators
with desirable properties such as double robustness. We propose two estimators
of the optimal rule, which arise from considering two loss functions aimed at
(i) directly estimating the conditional treatment effect (also know as the blip

that uses the 0-1 loss function. Our estimated rules are super learning
ensembles that minimize the cross-validated risk of a linear combination in a
user-supplied library of candidate estimators. We prove oracle inequalities
bounding the finite sample excess risk of the estimator. The bounds depend on
the excess risk of the oracle selector and a doubly robust term related to
estimation of the nuisance parameters. We discuss some important implications

estimator to that of the oracle selector. We illustrate our methods in the

  and Applications (NCA 2017)",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large portion of data mining and analytic services use modern machine
learning techniques, such as deep learning. The state-of-the-art results by
deep learning come at the price of an intensive use of computing resources. The
leading frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) are executed on GPUs or on high-end
servers in datacenters. On the other end, there is a proliferation of personal
devices with possibly free CPU cycles; this can enable services to run in
users' homes, embedding machine learning operations. In this paper, we ask the
following question: Is distributed deep learning computation on WAN connected
devices feasible, in spite of the traffic caused by learning tasks? We show
that such a setup rises some important challenges, most notably the ingress
traffic that the servers hosting the up-to-date model have to sustain.
  In order to reduce this stress, we propose adaComp, a novel algorithm for
compressing worker updates to the model on the server. Applicable to stochastic
gradient descent based approaches, it combines efficient gradient selection and
learning rate modulation. We then experiment and measure the impact of
compression, device heterogeneity and reliability on the accuracy of learned
models, with an emulator platform that embeds TensorFlow into Linux containers.
We report a reduction of the total amount of data sent by workers to the server
by two order of magnitude (e.g., 191-fold reduction for a convolutional network
on the MNIST dataset), when compared to a standard asynchronous stochastic
gradient descent, while preserving model accuracy.

may belong to multiple labels simultaneously. Predicting each label
independently has been criticized for not exploiting any correlation between
labels. In this paper we propose a novel approach, Nearest Labelset using
Double Distances (NLDD), that predicts the labelset observed in the training
data that minimizes a weighted sum of the distances in both the feature space
and the label space to the new instance. The weights specify the relative
tradeoff between the two distances. The weights are estimated from a binomial
regression of the number of misclassified labels as a function of the two
distances. Model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. NLDD only
considers labelsets observed in the training data, thus implicitly taking into
account label dependencies. Experiments on benchmark multi-label data sets show
that the proposed method on average outperforms other well-known approaches in
terms of Hamming loss, 0/1 loss, and multi-label accuracy and ranks second
after ECC on the F-measure.

their decisions on experience and intuition rather than on statistical models.
While understandable, relying on intuition over models has often been found to
result in inferior outcomes. Here we present a new method,
select-regress-and-round, for constructing simple rules that perform well for
complex decisions. These rules take the form of a weighted checklist, can be
applied mentally, and nonetheless rival the performance of modern machine
learning algorithms. Our method for creating these rules is itself simple, and
can be carried out by practitioners with basic statistics knowledge. We
demonstrate this technique with a detailed case study of judicial decisions to
release or detain defendants while they await trial. In this application, as in
many policy settings, the effects of proposed decision rules cannot be directly
observed from historical data: if a rule recommends releasing a defendant that
the judge in reality detained, we do not observe what would have happened under
the proposed action. We address this key counterfactual estimation problem by
drawing on tools from causal inference. We find that simple rules significantly
outperform judges and are on par with decisions derived from random forests
trained on all available features. Generalizing to 22 varied decision-making
domains, we find this basic result replicates. We conclude with an analytical
framework that helps explain why these simple decision rules perform as well as
they do.

is described in terms of elementary geometrical optics. Our approach is based
on the premise that image replicates the intensity distribution (real or
virtual) at the front focal plane of the objective. The task is therefore
reduced to finding the change in intensity at the focal plane caused by the
object. This can be done by ray tracing complemented with the requirement of
conservation of the number of rays. Despite major simplifications involved in
such an analysis, it reproduces some results from the paraxial wave theory.
Additionally, our analysis suggests two ways of extracting quantitative phase
information from bright-field images: by vertically shifting the focal plane
(the approach used in the transport-of-intensity analysis) or by varying the
angle of illumination. In principle, information thus obtained should allow
reconstruction of the object morphology.

solved as a convex optimisation problem, for which fast and robust solvers
exist. The proposed method does not assume real and reactive power flows are
decoupled, allowing line losses, voltage constraints and converter current
constraints to be addressed. In addition, non-linear variations in the charge

in the control strategy. Real-time digital simulations were carried out for an
islanded microgrid based on the IEEE 13 bus prototypical feeder, with

truncated accretion disk. To explain their strong flickering X-ray emission,
accretion has been successfully taken into account. Nevertheless, observations
suggest that accretion phenomena could not be the only process behind it. An
intense flaring activity occurring on the surface of the disk may generate a
corona, contribute to the thermal X-ray emission and influence the system
stability. Our purposes are: investigating the formation of an extended corona
above the accretion disk, due to an intense flaring activity occurring on the
disk surface; studying its effects on the disk and stellar magnetosphere;
assessing its contribution to the observed X-ray flux. We have developed a 3D
MHD model of a IPCV. The model takes into account gravity, disk viscosity,
thermal conduction, radiative losses and coronal flare heating. To perform a
parameter space exploration, several system conditions have been considered,
with different magnetic field intensity and disk density values. From the
results of the evolution of the model, we have synthesized the thermal X-ray
emission. The simulations show the formation of an extended corona, linking
disk and star. The flaring activity is capable of strongly influencing the disk
configuration and its stability, effectively deforming the magnetic field
lines. Hot plasma evaporation phenomena occur in the layer immediately above
the disk. The flaring activity gives rise to a thermal X-ray emission in both
the [0.1-2.0] keV and the [2.0-10] keV bands. An intense coronal activity
occurring on the disk surface of an IPCV can affect the structure of the disk
depending noticeably on the density of the disk and the magnetic field of the
central object. Moreover, the synthesis of the thermal X-ray fluxes shows that
this flaring activity may contribute to the observed thermal X-ray emission.

These suspensions are characterized by rich and complex dynamics of vesicles

investigate the effect of a number of algorithmic empirical fixes in an attempt

a dynamic-weighting scheme to automatically assign the loss weight to each side

possibly one-bit, Sigma-Delta schemes, and use a reconstruction method based on
convex optimization. We show that the part of the reconstruction error due to

with analogous results on Sigma-Delta quantization associated with random

associated with the widely assumed memoryless scalar quantization. Moreover, we
prove that our approach is stable and robust; i.e., the reconstruction error
degrades gracefully in the presence of non-quantization noise and when the

concerning subgaussian chaos processes as well as a variation of McDiarmid's

coordinates to promote to Hermitian operators, which also become the principal
ingredients in the quantum Hamiltonian. While generally appropriate, this
procedure can also fail, e.g., for covariant, quartic, scalar fields in
five-and-more spacetime dimensions (and possibly four spacetime dimensions as
well), which become trivial; such failures are normally blamed on the `problem'
rather than on the 'quantization procedure'. In Enhanced Quantization the
association of $c$-numbers to $q$-numbers is chosen very differently such that:
(i) there is no need to seek classical, Cartesian, phase-space coordinates;
(ii) every classical, contact transformation is applicable and no change of the
quantum operators arises; (iii) a new understanding of the importance of
'Cartesian coordinates' is established; and (iv) although discussed elsewhere
in detail, the procedures of enhanced quantization offer fully acceptable
solutions yielding non-trivial results for quartic scalar fields in
four-and-more spacetime dimensions. In early sections, this paper offers a
wide-audience approach to the basic principles of Enhanced Quantization using
simple examples; later, several significant examples are cited for a deeper
understanding. An historical note concludes the paper.

distortion from the unlensed waveforms. This phenomenon is in addition to the
usual frequency-independent magnification, and happens even in the geometric

different topological types among a set of multiple images, and give us

density of radio-loud AGNs at $z>3$, this work investigates the viability of
the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) quenching mechanism of
intrinsically jetted, high-z AGNs, whereby Inverse Compton scattering of CMB
photons off electrons within the extended lobes results in a substantial
dimming of the lobe synchrotron emission at GHz frequencies, while
simultaneously boosting their diffuse X-ray signal. We focus on five $z>3.5$
radio galaxies that have sufficiently deep Chandra exposure (> 50 ks) to
warrant a meaningful investigation of any extended X-ray emission. For those
objects with evidence for statistically significant extended X-ray lobes (4C
41.17 and 4C 03.24), we combine the Chandra measurements with literature data
at lower frequencies to assemble the systems' Spectral Energy Distributions
(SEDs), and utilize state-of-the-art SED modelling (Ghisellini et al. 2015) --
including emission from the disk, torus, jet, hotspots, and lobes -- to infer
their physical parameters. For both radio galaxies, the magnetic energy density
in the hotspots is found to exceed the energy density in CMB photons, wheres
the opposite is true for the lobes. This implies that any extended synchrotron
emission likely originates from the hotspots themselves, rather than the lobes.
Conversely, Inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons dominates the extended
X-ray emission from the lobes, which are effectively ""radio-quenched"". As a
result, CMB quenching is effective in these systems in spite of the fact that
the observed X-ray to radio luminosity ratio does not bear the signature
$(1+z)^4$ dependence of the CMB energy density.

the optical-infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main
sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to
determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, M$_{\rm *}$, and specific SFR
(sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately 0.63 power of
the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the
sSFR/sSFR$_MS$. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR
redshift evolutionary and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the
increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses
and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function we estimate the
accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution
($>100$ \msun yr$^{-1}$ at z $>$ 2.5). Simple power-law dependences are
similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall
evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic
evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and
AGN activity at early epochs.

$z=6.11$ multiply imaged by the massive foreground galaxy cluster RXJ2248. The

constraints on the metallicity and the ionization state of the galaxy. The
estimated line ratios and equivalent widths do not support a scenario where an
AGN is responsible for ionizing the carbon atoms. SED fits including nebular
emission lines imply a source with a mass of log(M/M$_\odot)\sim9$, SFR of
around 10M$_\odot$/yr, and a young stellar population $<50$Myr old. The source
shows a stronger ionizing radiation field than objects with detected CIV

smoothness implied by the usage of higher-order interpolation functions to
achieve a spatially higher-order accurate algorithm (up to fifth order). We
validate our algorithm against several test problems -- thermal stability of
stationary plasma, stability of linear plasma waves, and two-stream instability

exact solutions of the dispersion relations, we demonstrate that SHARP can
quantitatively reproduce important kinetic features of the linear regime. Our
simulations have a superior ability to control energy non-conservation and
avoid numerical heating in comparison to common second-order schemes. We
provide a natural definition for convergence of a general PIC algorithm: the
complement of physical modes captured by the simulation, i.e., those that lie
above the Poisson noise, must grow commensurately with the resolution. This
implies that it is necessary to simultaneously increase the number of particles
per cell and decrease the cell size. We demonstrate that traditional ways for
testing for convergence fail, leading to plateauing of the energy error. This
new PIC code enables us to faithfully study the long-term evolution of plasma
problems that require absolute control of the energy and momentum conservation.

dielectric constant (GDC) at very low frequencies, we propose an
electromechanical mechanism which is based on a local field effect. At zero
electric field and large enough e-p coupling the structures are naturally
pinned by the lattice due to its discreteness, and develop modulation functions
which are characterized by discontinuities. When the electric field is turned
on, we show that it exists a finite threshold value for the electric field
above which the discontinuities of the modulation functions vanish due to CDW
deformation. The CDW is then free to move. The signature of this
pinning/depinning transition as a function of the increasing electric field can
be directly observed in the phonon spectrum by using inelastic neutrons or
X-rays experiments.

sizes, are still largely unexplored by observations. To what extent brown dwarf

work is a step towards establishing a relationship through the eventual
modelling of future observations.
  We use observations of the brown dwarf disc $\rho$ Oph 102 to infer a
fiducial model around which we build a small grid of brown dwarf disc models,
in order to model the CO, HCN, and HCO+ line fluxes and the chemistry which
drives their abundances. These are the first brown dwarf models to be published
which relate detailed, 2D radiation thermochemical disc models to observational
data.
  We predict that moderately extended ALMA antenna configurations will
spatially resolve CO line emission around brown dwarf discs, and that HCN and
HCO+ will be detectable in integrated flux, following our conclusion that the
flux ratios of these molecules to CO emission are comparable to that of T Tauri
discs. These molecules have not yet been observed in sub-mm wavelengths in a
brown dwarf disc, yet they are crucial tracers of the warm surface-layer gas
and of ionization in the outer parts of the disc.
  We present the prediction that if the physical and chemical processes in
brown dwarf discs are similar to those that occur in T Tauri discs -- as our
models suggest -- then the same diagnostics that are used for T Tauri discs can
be used for brown dwarf discs (such as HCN and HCO+ lines that have not yet
been observed in the sub-mm), and that these lines should be observable with
ALMA. Through future observations, either confirmation (or refutation) of these
ideas about brown dwarf disc chemistry will have strong implications for our
understanding of disc chemistry, structure, and subsequent planet formation in

Applications of graph cuts include community detection and computer vision.
However, cut problems were originally proposed for static graphs, an assumption
that does not hold in many modern applications where graphs are highly dynamic.
In this paper, we introduce the sparsest and normalized cut problems in
temporal graphs, which generalize their standard definitions by enforcing the
smoothness of cuts over time. We propose novel formulations and algorithms for

obtain an optimal individual treatment rule (ITR), which can help make

characteristics. Recently, outcome weighted learning (OWL) has been proposed to
estimate such an optimal ITR in a binary treatment setting by maximizing the
expected clinical outcome. However, for ordinal treatment settings, such as
individualized dose finding, it is unclear how to use OWL. In this paper, we

explicit constant) for bounded continuous functions on any given convex domain.

their posterior distribution after seeing one single additional instance. To do
so, they must compute moments of the model parameters under this distribution.
The best existing method for computing such moments scales quadratically in the
size of the SPN, although it scales linearly for trees. This unfortunate
scaling makes Bayesian online algorithms prohibitively expensive, except for
small or tree-structured SPNs. We propose an optimal linear-time algorithm that
works even when the SPN is a general directed acyclic graph (DAG), which
significantly broadens the applicability of Bayesian online algorithms for
SPNs. There are three key ingredients in the design and analysis of our
algorithm: 1). For each edge in the graph, we construct a linear time reduction
from the moment computation problem to a joint inference problem in SPNs. 2).
Using the property that each SPN computes a multilinear polynomial, we give an
efficient procedure for polynomial evaluation by differentiation without
expanding the network that may contain exponentially many monomials. 3). We
propose a dynamic programming method to further reduce the computation of the
moments of all the edges in the graph from quadratic to linear. We demonstrate
the usefulness of our linear time algorithm by applying it to develop a linear
time assume density filter (ADF) for SPNs.

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has been used to monitor a population

spanning 20 years, we obtain 23 high-resolution radio images of Arp 220 at

estimates of flux densities and sizes of all detected sources. We detect radio
continuum emission from 97 compact sources and present flux densities and sizes

Arp 220, with larger sources being less luminous. We find a compact source LF
$n(L)\propto L^\beta$ with $\beta=-2.19\pm0.15$, similar to SNRs in normal
galaxies. Based on simulations we argue that there are many relatively large
and weak sources below our detection threshold. The observations can be
explained by a mixed population of SNe and SNRs, where the former expand in a
dense circumstellar medium (CSM) and the latter interact with the surrounding
interstellar medium (ISM). Nine sources are likely luminous, type IIn SNe. This
number of luminous SNe correspond to few percent of the total number of SNe in
Arp 220 which is consistent with a total SN-rate of 4 yr$^{-1}$ as inferred
from the total radio emission given a normal stellar initial mass function

of 105 apparently single O-type dwarfs. To determine stellar and wind
parameters, we used the IACOB-GBAT package, an automatic procedure based on a
large grid of atmospheric models calculated with the FASTWIND code. In addition
to classical techniques, we applied the Bayesian BONNSAI tool to estimate
evolutionary masses. We provide a new calibration of effective temperature vs.
spectral type for O-type dwarfs in the LMC, based on our homogeneous analysis
of the largest sample of such objects to date and including all spectral
subtypes. Good agreement with previous results is found, although the sampling
at the earliest subtypes could be improved. Rotation rates and helium
abundances are studied in an evolutionary context. We find that most of the
rapid rotators (vsini higher than 300 km/s ) in our sample have masses below 25
MSun and intermediate rotation-corrected gravities (log gc between 3.9 and
4.1). Such rapid rotators are scarce at higher gravities (i.e. younger ages)
and absent at lower gravities (larger ages). This is not expected from
theoretical evolutionary models, and does not appear to be due to a selection
bias in our sample. We compare the estimated evolutionary and spectroscopic
masses, finding a trend that the former is higher for masses below 20 MSun.
This can be explained as a consequence of limiting our sample to the O-type
stars, and we see no compelling evidence for a systematic mass discrepancy. For
most of the stars in the sample we were unable to estimate the wind-strength
parameter (hence mass-loss rates) reliably, particularly for objects with
luminosity lower than logL/LSun about 5.1. Ultraviolet spectroscopy is needed
to undertake a detailed investigation of the wind properties of these dwarfs.

stars. We find about four hundred good candidate members ranging from OB types
down to slightly sub-solar masses. About one-hundred heavily-reddened
early-type Carina members found here were previously unrecognized or poorly
classified, including two candidate O stars and several candidate Herbig Ae/Be

the relative placement of stars along the line of sight. We find a complex
spatial structure, with definite clustering of low-mass members around the most
massive stars, and spatially-variable extinction. By combining the new data

three-dimensional spatial structure of the Carina clusters, and of their
connection to bright and dark nebulosity, and UV sources. The identification of
tens of background giants enables us also to determine the total optical depth

planar graphs: Given a directed planar graph on $n$ vertices, a source vertex
$s$ and a sink vertex $t$, our algorithm removes all the arcs that do not
participate in any simple $s,t$-path in linear-time. The output graph produced
by our algorithm satisfies the prerequisite needed by the $O(n\log n)$-time
algorithm of Weihe [FOCS'94 \& JCSS'97] for computing maximum $s,t$-flow in
directed planar graphs. Previously, Weihe's algorithm could not run in $O(n\log
n)$-time due to the absence of the preprocessing step; all the preceding
algorithms run in $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$-time [Misiolek-Chen, COCOON'05 \&
IPL'06; Biedl, Brejov{\'{a}} and Vinar, MFCS'00]. Consequently, this provides
an alternative $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm for computing maximum $s,t$-flow in
directed planar graphs in addition to the known $O(n\log n)$-time algorithms
[Borradaile-Klein, SODA'06 \& J.ACM'09; Erickson, SODA'10].
  Our algorithm can be seen as a (truly) linear-time $s,t$-flow sparsifier for
directed planar graphs, which runs faster than any maximum $s,t$-flow algorithm
(which can also be seen of as a sparsifier). The simplified structures of the
resulting graph might be useful in future developments of maximum $s,t$-flow
algorithms in both directed and undirected planar graphs.

observe that magnetic helicity of opposite signs is generated between large and
small scales. We explain these observations by carrying out an analysis of the
magnetohydrodynamic equations reduced to triad interactions using the Fourier
helical decomposition. Within this framework, the direct cascade of positive
magnetic helicity arises through triad interactions that are associated with
small scale dynamo action, while the occurrence of negative magnetic helicity
at large scales is explained through triad interactions that are related to
stretch-twist-fold dynamics and small scale dynamo action, which compete with
the inverse cascade of positive magnetic helicity. Our analytical and numerical
results suggest that the direct cascade of magnetic helicity is a finite
magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ effect that will vanish in the limit $Rm \to

luminosity, which is hypothesised to ionise all of the neutral gas in the host

these in context of the previous surveys, in addition to the anti-correlation
with the ultra-violet luminosity (ionising photon rate), we find a correlation
between the strength of the absorption and the blue -- near-infrared colour, as
well as the radio-band turnover frequency. We believe that these are due to the
photo-ionisation of the neutral gas, an obscured sight-line being more
conducive to the presence of cold gas and the compact radio emission being
better intercepted by the absorbing gas, maximising the flux coverage,
respectively. Regarding the photo-ionisation, the compilation of the previous
surveys increases the significance of the critical ionising photon rate, above
which all of the gas in the host galaxy is hypothesised to be ionised, to >5

  Data on a Taxonomic Tree",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In human microbiome studies, sequencing reads data are often summarized as
counts of bacterial taxa at various taxonomic levels specified by a taxonomic
tree. This paper considers the problem of analyzing two repeated measurements
of microbiome data from the same subjects. Such data are often collected to
assess the change of microbial composition after certain treatment, or the
difference in microbial compositions across body sites. Existing models for
such count data are limited in modeling the covariance structure of the counts
and in handling paired multinomial count data. A new probability distribution
is proposed for paired-multinomial count data, which allows flexible covariance
structure and can be used to model repeatedly measured multivariate count data.
Based on this distribution, a test statistic is developed for testing the
difference in compositions based on paired multinomial count data. The proposed
test can be applied to the count data observed on a taxonomic tree in order to
test difference in microbiome compositions and to identify the subtrees with
different subcompositions. Simulation results indicate that proposed test has
correct type 1 errors and increased power compared to some commonly used
methods. An analysis of an upper respiratory tract microbiome data set is used
to illustrate the proposed methods.

functionality of materials with an electric dipole that can be switched by
external electric fields. Spontaneous polarization is a crucial ferroelectric
property, and its amplitude is determined by the strength of polar structural
distortions. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used
theoretical methods to study ferroelectric properties, yet it is limited by the
levels of approximations in electron exchange-correlation. On the one hand, the
local density approximation (LDA) is considered to be more accurate for the
conventional perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 than the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA), which suffers from the so-called
super-tetragonality error. On the other hand, GGA is more suitable for
hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics than LDA, which largely overestimates the
strength of hydrogen bonding in general. We show here that the recently
developed general-purpose strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)
meta-GGA functional significantly improves over the traditional LDA/GGA for
structural, electric, and energetic properties of diversely-bonded
ferroelectric materials with a comparable computational effort, and thus
enhances largely the predictive power of DFT in studies of ferroelectric
materials. We also address the observed system-dependent performances of LDA

scaling is lost, the inner cut-off length {\epsilon}i. In this context, the
present study considers laboratory experiments and one-step reaction DNS of

flames. Fractal dimension is found to be substantially constant and well below
that typical of passive scalar fronts. The inner cut-off length shows a clear
scaling with the dissipative scale of Kolmogorov for the regimes here

linear slope of the KS relation whereas a positive correlation between

expert advice with limited/bandit feedback. We consider each expert as a
learning entity, seeking to more accurately reflecting certain real-world
applications. In our setting, the feedback at any time $t$ is limited in a
sense that it is only available to the expert $i^t$ that has been selected by
the central algorithm (forecaster), \emph{i.e.}, only the expert $i^t$ receives
feedback from the environment and gets to learn at time $t$. We consider a
generic black-box approach whereby the forecaster does not control or know the
learning dynamics of the experts apart from knowing the following no-regret
learning property: the average regret of any expert $j$ vanishes at a rate of
at least $O(t_j^{\regretRate-1})$ with $t_j$ learning steps where $\regretRate
\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter.
  In the spirit of competing against the best action in hindsight in

cumulative losses the algorithm could receive by following the policy of always
selecting one expert. We prove the following hardness result: without any
coordination between the forecaster and the experts, it is impossible to design
a forecaster achieving no-regret guarantees. In order to circumvent this
hardness result, we consider a practical assumption allowing the forecaster to
""guide"" the learning process of the experts by filtering/blocking some of the
feedbacks observed by them from the environment, \emph{i.e.}, not allowing the
selected expert $i^t$ to learn at time $t$ for some time steps. Then, we design
a novel no-regret learning algorithm \algo for this problem setting by
carefully guiding the feedbacks observed by experts. We prove that \algo
achieves the worst-case expected cumulative regret of $O(\Time^\frac{1}{2 -

identifying and determining the subtle features of gameplay that provide a
winning advantage. As an initial case study, we investigate whether the

a range of easy to use methods for annotation, including feature-based codes
and labels, text annotations associated with codes, and image-based drawing.
The outputs, including instance movies that are uniquely associated with coded
events, provide the basis for a training program or team-based analysis that
could be used in unison with discipline specific analysis software. In this
coordinated approach to visualization and analysis, SportsCode can act as a

first glance to be distinct. In a laser, phase information is maintained by a
macroscopic intracavity light field, and the robustness of this phase is what
leads to the coherence of the output light. In contrast, the coherence of
steady-state superradiant systems derives from the macroscopic collective
dipole of a many-atom ensemble. In this paper, we develop a quantum theory that
connects smoothly between these two extreme limits. We show that lasing and
steady-state superradiance should be thought of as the two extreme limits of a
continuous crossover. The properties of systems that lie in the superradiance,
lasing, and crossover parameter regions are compared. We find that for a given
output intensity a narrower linewidth can be obtained by operating closer to
the superradiance side of the crossover. We also find that the collective phase
is robust against cavity frequency fluctuations in the superradiant regime and
against atomic level fluctuations in the lasing regime.

and Hessian sketch used to approximately solve the Matrix Ridge Regression
(MRR) problem. Prior research has quantified the effects of classical sketch on
the strictly simpler least squares regression (LSR) problem. We establish that
classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR
as it does on those of LSR: namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. By
contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee, instead, the
approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the ""mass"" in the
responses and the optimal objective value.
  For both types of approximation, the regularization in the sketched MRR
problem results in significantly different statistical properties from those of
the sketched LSR problem. In particular, there is a bias-variance trade-off in
sketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR. We provide upper and lower
bounds on the bias and variance of sketched MRR, these bounds show that
classical sketch significantly increases the variance, while Hessian sketch
significantly increases the bias. Empirically, sketched MRR solutions can have
risks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude than those of the optimal MRR
solutions.
  We establish theoretically and empirically that model averaging greatly
decreases the gap between the risks of the true and sketched solutions to the
MRR problem. Thus, in parallel or distributed settings, sketching combined with
model averaging is a powerful technique that quickly obtains near-optimal
solutions to the MRR problem while greatly mitigating the increased statistical
risk incurred by sketching.

properties can be exploited for electronics applications. Some of these
circuits have been modeled as systems of ordinary differential equations.
However, as the number of components in newer circuits increases so does the
complexity. This renders continuous dynamical systems models impractical and
necessitates new modeling techniques. In recent years some discrete dynamical
models have been developed using various simplifying assumptions. To create a
robust modeling framework for chaotic logical circuits, we developed both
deterministic and stochastic discrete dynamical models, which exploit the
natural recurrence behavior, for two chaotic NOR gates and a chaotic set/reset
flip-flop (RSFF). This work presents a complete applied mathematical
investigation of logical circuits. Experiments on our own designs of the above
circuits are modeled and the models are rigorously analyzed and simulated
showing surprisingly close qualitative agreement with the experiments.
Furthermore, the models are designed to accommodate dynamics of similarly
designed circuits. This will allow researchers to develop ever more complex
chaotic logical circuits with a simple modeling framework.

methods show some FPR inflation in those tests (and assumptions of
Gaussian-shaped spatial smoothness also appear to be generally incorrect),
their emphasis on reporting the single worst result from thousands of
simulation cases greatly exaggerated the scale of the problem. Importantly, FPR
statistics depend on ""task"" paradigm and voxelwise p-value threshold; as such,
we show how results of their study provide useful suggestions for FMRI study
design and analysis, rather than simply a catastrophic downgrading of the

bug-effect was greatly overstated - their own results show that AFNI results
were not ""particularly"" worse than others. We describe further updates in AFNI

FPRs, though some remain >5%); additionally, we outline two newly implemented

As expected, the Nernst voltage scales linearly with the length of the wire.
Based on heat conduction and fluid dynamic equations, finite-element method is
used to calculate the temperature gradient across the Galfenol wire and
determine the Nernst coefficient. A giant Nernst coefficient of -2.6
${\mu}$V/KT at room temperature is estimated, in agreement with measurements on
bulk Galfenol. We expect that the giant Nernst effect in Galfenol arises from
its magnetostriction, presumably through enhanced magnon-phonon coupling. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of a transverse thermoelectric generator
capable of scalable output power from non-flat heat sources.

the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on. We
investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form

distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the
extensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated
entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the
strategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching
factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several
first-order methods by a factor of $\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching
factor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.
  Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in
practice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their
theoretically inferior convergence rates. Using our new weighting scheme and
practical tuning we show that, for the first time, the excessive gap technique
can be made faster than the fastest counterfactual regret minimization
algorithm, CFR+, in practice.

some of the parametric regression assumptions, the permutation tests maintain
power comparable to ANCOVA. We illustrate the use of these permutation tests

algorithms, the test samples are sparely represented by all training samples.
They emphasize the sparsity of the coding coefficients but without considering
the local structure of the input data. To overcome the shortcoming, aiming at
the difficult problem of plant leaf recognition on the large-scale database, a
two-stage local similarity based classification learning method is proposed by
combining local mean-based classification method and local WSRC. In the first
stage, LMC is applied to coarsely classifying the test sample. nearest
neighbors of the test sample, as a neighbor subset, is selected from each
training class, then the local geometric center of each class is calculated. S
candidate neighbor subsets of the test sample are determined with the first
smallest distances between the test sample and each local geometric center. In
the second stage, LWSRC is proposed to approximately represent the test sample
through a linear weighted sum of all samples of the candidate neighbor subsets.
The rationale of the proposed method is as follows: the first stage aims to
eliminate the training samples that are far from the test sample and assume
that these samples have no effects on the ultimate classification decision,
then select the candidate neighbor subsets of the test sample. Thus the
classification problem becomes simple with fewer subsets; the second stage pays
more attention to those training samples of the candidate neighbor subsets in
weighted representing the test sample. This is helpful to accurately represent
the test sample. Experimental results on the leaf image database demonstrate
that the proposed method not only has a high accuracy and low time cost, but
also can be clearly interpreted.

which shortens the epoch time to reduce the sensitivity to packet losses and in
turn to increase the average throughput. Agile-SD has only been tested via

contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a new mathematical model for the

the well-known Markov chains to validate the correctness of Agile-SD and to
show the impact of buffer size, multiplicative decrease factor, and maximum

automated algorithm configuration and parameter tuning (AACPT) technique is
employed to optimize and automate the configuration of {\lambda}max .
Furthermore, the numerical results for both NewReno and Agile-SD are compared
with the simulation results, in which the validity of the proposed model is
confirmed. Moreover, the output of the AACPT is exploited to formulate a new
equation, which calculates the optimal {\lambda}max from a given \b{eta} in

role of caging more closely we consider the spread of the displacement
distributions of Brownian particles. These distributions are necessarily biased
by the presence of neighbouring particles. Accommodation of this bias by those
neighbours conserves the displacement distribution locally and presents a
collective mechanism for exploring configuration space that is more efficient
than the intrinsic Brownian motion. Caging of some particles incurs, through
the impost of global conservation of the displacement distribution, a delayed,
non-local collective process. This non-locality compromises the efficiency with
which configuration space is explored. Both collective mechanisms incur delay
or stretching of time correlation functions, in particular the particle number
and flux densities. This paper identifies and distinguishes these mechanisms in

$\alpha\lesssim-2$ at $z\sim9-10$. We also find that the evolution of UV
luminosity densities shows a non-accelerated decline beyond $z\sim8$ in the
case of $M_\mathrm{trunc}=-15$, while an accelerated in the case of
$M_\mathrm{trunc}=-17$. We examine whether our results are consistent with the
Thomson scattering optical depth from the Planck satellite and the ionized
hydrogen fraction $Q_\mathrm{HII}$ at $z\lesssim7$ based on the standard
analytic reionization model. We find that there exist reionizaiton scenarios
that consistently explain all the observational measurements with the allowed
parameters of $f_{\rm esc}=0.17^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and $M_\mathrm{trunc}>-14.0$
for $\log\xi_\mathrm{ion}/[\mathrm{erg}^{-1}\ \mathrm{Hz}]=25.34$, where
$f_{\rm esc}$ is the escape fraction, $M_\mathrm{trunc}$ is the faint limit of
the UV luminosity function, and $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ is the conversion factor of
the UV luminosity to the ionizing photon emission rate. The length of the
reionization period is estimated to be $\Delta z=3.9^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ (for
$0.1<Q_\mathrm{HII}<0.99$), consistent with the recent estimate from Planck.

lesion segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient images. Our approach is
based on a cascade of two 3D patch-wise convolutional neural networks (CNN).
The first network is trained to be more sensitive revealing possible candidate
lesion voxels while the second network is trained to reduce the number of
misclassified voxels coming from the first network. This cascaded CNN
architecture tends to learn well from small sets of training data, which can be
very interesting in practice, given the difficulty to obtain manual label
annotations and the large amount of available unlabeled Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) data. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method on the
public MS lesion segmentation challenge MICCAI2008 dataset, comparing it with
respect to other state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation tools. Furthermore,
the proposed method is also evaluated on two private MS clinical datasets,
where the performance of our method is also compared with different recent
public available state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods. At the time
of writing this paper, our method is the best ranked approach on the MICCAI2008

available input modalities (T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR), while still in the top-rank

our approach exhibits a significant increase in the accuracy segmenting of WM
lesions when compared with the rest of evaluated methods, highly correlating

this paper, we make a first effort to study this modern software mechanism. Our
objective is to measure the current practice of the declared SDK versions

between the DSDK versions and their app API calls. To this end, we perform a
three-dimensional analysis. First, we parse Android documents to obtain a

analyze the DSDK-API consistency for over 24K apps, among which we pre-exclude
1.3K apps that provide different app binaries for different Android versions
through Google Play analysis. Besides shedding light on the current DSDK
practice, our study quantitatively measures the two side effects of
inappropriate DSDK versions: (i) around 1.8K apps have API calls that do not
exist in some declared SDK versions, which causes runtime crash bugs on those
platform versions; (ii) over 400 apps, due to claiming the outdated targeted
DSDK versions, are potentially exploitable by remote code execution. These
results indicate the importance and difficulty of declaring correct DSDK, and
our work can help developers fulfill this goal.

which workers forego their own reproduction while the queen produces almost all
offspring. The presence of the queen is key for maintaining social harmony, but
the specific role of the queen in the evolution of eusociality remains unclear.
A long-discussed scenario is that a queen either behaviorally or chemically
sterilizes her workers. However, the demographic and ecological conditions that
enable such manipulation are unknown. Accordingly, we propose a simple model of
evolutionary dynamics that is based on haplodiploid genetics. We consider a
mutation that acts in a queen, causing her to control the reproductive behavior
of her workers. Our mathematical analysis yields precise conditions for the
evolutionary emergence and stability of queen-induced worker sterility. These
conditions do not depend on the queen's mating frequency. Moreover, we find
that queen control is always established if it increases colony reproductive
efficiency and can evolve even if it decreases colony efficiency. We further
outline the conditions under which queen control is evolutionarily stable
against invasion by mutant, reproductive workers.

can be made either in the diffusive or strongly-localized regime by a judicious

shows persistent photoconductivity following excitation by a brief exposure to
infrared radiation. Persistent photoconductivity is also observed in GexTe
samples alloyed with Mn. However, in both Ge_xTe and GeMn_xTe_y the effect is
much weaker than that observable in GeSb_xTe_y alloys suggesting that antimony
plays an important role in the phenomenon. Structural studies of these films
reveal an unusual degree of texture that is rarely realized in
strongly-disordered systems with high carrier-concentrations.
Anderson-localized samples of Ge_xTe exhibit non-ergodic transport which are
characteristic of intrinsic electron-glasses, including a well developed

formulation of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. Our main result is
the identification of a new spin-generation torque arising from the

current-induced spin polarization does not necessarily coincide with that of
the internal Rashba-Dresselhaus field, and an out-of-plane component of the

propagating through a background medium formed by ordered magnetic moments. In
an isotropic Heisenberg system, these disturbances vary in a continuous manner
around an ordered spin structure, thus requiring infinitesimal energy as a
wavevector approaches a magnetic zone centre. However, competing anisotropic
interactions arising from broken symmetry can favour a distinct static and
dynamic spin state causing a shift of the minimum point of the magnon
dispersion to a nonreciprocal wavevector. Here we report the first direct
evidence of these nonreciprocal magnons in an antiferromagnet. In the
antiferromagnet we investigated, namely, noncentrosymmetric
$\alpha$-Cu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$, they are caused by the incompatibility between
anisotropic exchange and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
resulting in competing collinear and helical spin structures, respectively. The
nonreciprocity introduces the difference in the phase velocity of the
counter-rotating modes, causing the opposite spontaneous magnonic Faraday
rotation of the left- and right-propagating spin-waves. The breaking of spatial
inversion and time reversal symmetry is revealed as a magnetic-field-induced
asymmetric energy shift, which provides a test for the detailed balance
relation.

of the confinement in $SU(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in 2+1 space-time

number and the relative phase between two components as a dual gluon, we
identify HQVs in a single component as electrically charged particles with a
half baryon number. Further, we show that only singlet states of the relative
phase of two components can stably exist as bound states of vortices, that is,
a pair of vortices in each component (a baryon) and a pair of a vortex and an
antivortex in the same component (a meson). We then study the dynamics of a
baryon and meson; baryon is static at the equilibrium and rotates once it
deviates from the equilibrium, while a meson moves with constant velocity. For
both baryon and meson we verify a linear confinement and determine that they
are broken, thus creating other baryons or mesons in the middle when two
constituent vortices are separated by more than some critical distance,

multi-state trajectory (MST) approach from the time dependent Schr\""odinger
equation, resulting in equations of motion for coupled nuclear-electronic
dynamics equivalent to Hamilton dynamics or Heisenberg equation based on a new
multistate Meyer-Miller (MM) model. The derived MST formalism incorporates both
diabatic and adiabatic representations as limiting cases, and reduces to
Ehrenfest or Born-Oppenheimer dynamics in the mean field or the single state
limits, respectively. By quantizing nuclear dynamics to a particular active
state, the MST algorithm does not suffer from the instability caused by the
negative instant electronic population variables unlike the standard MM
dynamics. Furthermore the multistate representation for electron coupled
nuclear dynamics with each state associated with one individual trajectory
presumably captures single state dynamics better than the mean field
description. The coupled electronic-nuclear coherence is incorporated
consistently in the MST framework with no ad-hoc state switch and the
associated momentum adjustment or parameters for artificial decoherence, unlike
the original or modified surface hopping treatments. The implementation of the
MST approach to benchmark problems shows reasonably good agreement with exact
quantum calculations, and the results in both representations are similar in
accuracy. The active state trajectory (AST) approximation of the MST approach
provides a consistent interpretation to trajectory surface hopping, which
predicts the transition probabilities reasonably well for multiple nonadiabatic
transitions and conical intersection problems.

The study reveals that the resolution should be chosen with respect to the
coupling dynamics, and not only based on the flow properties, to avoid large

Martin-L\""of type theory that adds a notion of strict equality as an internal
primitive.
  A type theory with a strict equality alongside the more conventional form of
equality, the latter being of fundamental importance for the recent innovation
of homotopy type theory (HoTT), was first proposed by Voevodsky, and is usually
referred to as HTS.
  Here, we generalise and expand this idea, by developing a semantic framework
that gives a systematic account of type formers for two-level systems, and
proving a conservativity result relating back to a conventional type theory
like HoTT.
  Finally, we show how a two-level theory can be used to provide partial
solutions to open problems in HoTT. In particular, we use it to construct
semi-simplicial types, and lay out the foundations of an internal theory of
$(\infty, 1)$-categories.

of the forces between two parallel slabs separated at a distance $L$ from each

$T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. The surfaces of the colloid particles and the
slab are coated by thin layers exerting strong preference to the liquid phase
of the fluid, or one of the components of the mixture, modeled by strong
adsorbing local surface potentials, ensuring the so-called $(+,+)$ boundary

influence the fluid by long-ranged competing dispersion potentials. We
demonstrate that for a suitable set of colloids-fluid, slab-fluid, and
fluid-fluid coupling parameters the competition between the effects due to the
coatings and the core regions of the objects involved result, when one changes
$T$, $\mu$ or $L$, in {\it sign change} of the Casimir force (CF) {\it and} the
TF acting between the colloid and the slab, as well as between the colloids.

each node supports one from up to n opinions. Nodes randomly and in parallel
sample the opinions of constant many nodes. Based on these samples, they use an
update rule to change their own opinion.
  The goal is to reach consensus, a configuration where all nodes support the
same opinion. We compare two well-known update rules: 2-Choices and 3-Majority.
In the former, each node samples two nodes and adopts their opinion if they
agree. In the latter, each node samples three nodes: If an opinion is supported
by at least two samples the node adopts it, otherwise it randomly adopts one of
the sampled opinions. Known results for these update rules focus on initial
configurations with a limited number of colors (say $n^{1/3}$ ), or typically
assume a bias, where one opinion has a much larger support than any other. For
such biased configurations, the time to reach consensus is roughly the same for
2-Choices and 3-Majority.
  Interestingly, we prove that this is no longer true for configurations with a
large number of initial colors. In particular, we show that 3-Majority reaches
consensus with high probability in $O(n^{3/4}\log^{7/8}n)$ rounds, while
2-Choices can need $\Omega(n/\log n)$ rounds. We thus get the first
unconditional sublinear bound for 3-Majority and the first result separating
the consensus time of these processes. Along the way, we develop a framework

entanglement measures are equal to the v. Neumann entropy of the reduced state,
but for mixed states, this uniqueness is lost. In quantum field theory,
bipartite systems are associated with causally disjoint regions. There are no
separable (normal) states to begin with when the regions touch each other, so
one must leave a finite ""safety-corridor"". Due to this corridor, the normal
states of bipartite systems are necessarily mixed, and the v. Neumann entropy
is not a good entanglement measure in the above sense.
  In this paper, we study various entanglement measures which vanish on
separable states, do not increase under separable (local) operations, and have
other desirable properties. In particular, we study the relative entanglement
entropy, defined as the minimum relative entropy between the given state and an
arbitrary separable state. We establish rigorous upper and lower bounds in
various quantum field theoretic (QFT) models, as well as also model-independent

superconductor and c---a constriction. The systems of the first type are
analyzed on the basis of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. We show that
the impedance $Z(\Omega)$ has a maximum as a function of the frequency
$\Omega$, and the electric field $E_{\Omega}$ is determined by two
gauge-invariant quantities---the condensate momentum $Q_{\Omega}$ and the
potential $\mu$ related to charge imbalance. The structures of the second type
are studied on the basis of microscopic equations for quasiclassical Green's
functions in the Keldysh technique. For short S-c-S contacts (the Thouless
energy ${E_{\text{Th}} = D/L^{2} \gg \Delta}$) we present a formula for
admittance $Y$ valid at frequencies $\Omega$ and temperatures $T$ less than the
Thouless energy but arbitrary with respect to the energy gap $\Delta$. It is
shown that, at low temperatures, the absorption is absent [${\mathrm{Re}(Y) =
0}$] if the frequency does not exceed the energy gap in the center of the
constriction (${\Omega < \Delta \cos \varphi_{0}}$, where $2 \varphi_{0}$ is
the phase difference between the S reservoirs). The absorption gradually
increases with increasing the difference ${(\Omega - \Delta \cos \varphi_{0})}$
if $2 \varphi_{0}$ is less than the phase difference $2 \varphi_{\text{c}}$
corresponding to the critical Josephson current. In the interval ${2
\varphi_{\text{c}} < 2 \varphi_{0} < \pi}$, the absorption has a maximum. This
interval of the phase difference is achievable in phase-biased Josephson
junctions. Close to $T_{\text{c}}$ the admittance has a maximum at low $\Omega$
which is described by an analytical formula.

Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) require theoretical descriptions of the
complete event in a neutrino-nucleus reaction. Since nuclear targets are used
this requires a good understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions. [Purpose]
One of the dominant reaction channels in neutrino-nucleus interactions is pion
production. This paper aims for a coherent view on all charged current charged
pion production data that are avaible from the experiments MiniBooNE, the near
detector experiment at T2K and MINERvA. [Methods] Pion production is treated
through excitations of nucleon resonances, including background terms, and deep
inelastic scattering. The final state interactions of the produced pions are
described within the Giessen-Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) implementation
of quantum-kinetic transport theory. [Results] Results are given for MiniBooNE,
the near detector experiment at T2K and for MINERvA. While the theoretical
results for MiniBooNE differ from the data both in shape and magnitude, their
agreement both with the T2K and the MINERvA data is good for all pion and
lepton observables. Predictions for pion spectra are shown for MicroBooNE and
NOvA. [Conclusions] Based on the GiBUU model of lepton-nucleus interactions a
consistent, good theoretical description of CC charged pion production data
from the T2K ND and the MINERvA experiments is possible, without any parameter
tunes. The MiniBooNE data cannot be reproduced.

situated near the channel threshold when the Sommerfeld parameter is quite
large within the experimental energy region. As a result, the value of the
conventional effective-range function $K_l(k^2)$ is actually defined by the
Coulomb term. One of the resulting effects is the wrong description of energy
behavior of the elastic scattering phase shift $\delta_l$ reproduced from the
fitted total effective-range function $K_l(k^2)$. This leads to an improper
value of the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) value. No such problem
arises if we fit only the nuclear term. The difference between the total
effective-range function and the Coulomb part at real energies is the same as
the nuclear term. Then we can proceed using just this $\Delta$-method to
calculate the pole position values and the ANC. We apply it to the vertices

reduced complexity and exponential convergence. We analyze the performance of
the proposed distributed estimators, showing that they: (i) are reliable even

wind feedforward control did substantially improve the performance of the

better download rate for alternative content, low rate plans, etc.), thus
avoiding to access expensive/congested links. We formulate the problem of

only energetically stable QY states are capable of sustain a persistent
current. Based on physical considerations the stability is studied in two
different two-dimensional planes. One is when we are studying the stability of
a single QY state which is realized in the $U_{AB}\times U$ plane spanned by
the inter and intraspecies interaction strengths with fixed values of angular
momentum per particle $l$ and population imbalance $f$ equal to the labels of
the QY state. We found that the energetic phase boundary is the positive branch
of a hyperbola and the energetically stable domain the internal region of this
positive branch. The other is when we are studying the stability at a fixed
dynamics which is realized in the $l\times f$ plane spanned by $l$ and $f$ with
fixed values of the interaction strengths. The QY states are introduced when we
postulate a correspondence between points in sector of the $l\times f$ plane of
physical significance (SPS), defined by $-\infty< l<\infty$ and $-1\leq f\leq
1$, and QY states. The stability diagram in the SPS is determined by the
overlap of the stability diagram in all $l\times f$ plane and the SPS. We found
that there are critical values of $f$ and $l$. $f_\mathrm{crit}(l)$ gives the
size of the window of energetic stability in the sense that for a given $l$
only QY states with $0\leq f<f_\mathrm{crit}(l)$ are energetically stable. On

decompositions (up to an overall phase) in the given tensor product space and
the tensor product space obtained by the permuting the subsystems by $\sigma$.
Towards this, we construct a matrix whose action is to simultaneously permute
the subsystem label and subsystem dimension of a given state according to
permutation $\sigma$. Eigenvectors of this matrix have the required symmetry.
We then examine entanglement of states in the igenspaces of these matrices. It
is found that all nonsymmetric eigenspaces of such matrices are completely
entangled subspaces, with states being equally entangled in both the given
tensor product space and the permuted tensor product space.

particularly when it comes to clustering tasks that impose on strong structural
assumptions. This work presents an unsupervised method for assessing similarity
in bipartite data. Similar to some co-clustering methods, the method is based
on regular equivalence in graphs. The algorithm uses spectral properties of a
bipartite adjacency matrix to estimate similarity in both dimensions. The
method is reflexive in that similarity in one dimension is used to inform
similarity in the other. Reflexive regular equivalence can also use the
structure of transitivities -- in a network sense -- the contribution of which
is controlled by the algorithm's only free-parameter, $\alpha$. The method is
completely unsupervised and can be used to validate assumptions of
co-similarity, which are required but often untested, in co-clustering
analyses. Three variants of the method with different normalizations are tested
on synthetic data. The method is found to be robust to noise and well-suited to
asymmetric co-similar structure, making it particularly informative for cluster
analysis and recommendation in bipartite data of unknown structure. In
experiments, the convergence and speed of the algorithm are found to be stable
for different levels of noise. Real-world data from a network of malaria genes
are analyzed, where the similarity produced by the reflexive method is shown to
out-perform other measures' ability to correctly classify genes.

learning. For large scale problems, an attractive heuristic is to factorize the

$L$-smooth on the set $\{X:X\succeq 0,rank(X)\leq r\}$. We propose an

Globally, our method converges to the critical point with zero gradient from

sources with redshifts we use radio and X-ray luminosity, optical spectroscopy,
mid-infrared colors, and 24$\mu$m and IR to radio flux ratios to search for the
presence of an AGN. The analysis reveals a rapid change in the population as
flux density decreases from $\sim$500\,$\mu$Jy to $\sim$100\,$\mu$Jy. We find
that 80.3\% of the objects show no evidence of AGN and have multi-wavelength
properties consistent with radio emission from star forming galaxies (SFG). We
classify 11.4\% as Radio Quiet (RQ) AGN and the remaining 8.3\% as Radio Loud
(RL) AGN.
  The redshift of all populations extends to $z > 3$ with a median of $\sim$1.
The median radio and far-IR luminosity increases systematically from SFG, to RQ
AGN and RL AGN. The median $q_{\rm 24 \mu m}$ for SFG, $0.89\pm0.01$ is
slightly below that for RQ AGN, $1.05\pm0.03$, and both differ substantially

significant difference in far-IR/radio ratios and have statistically
indistinguishable star formation rates inferred from radio and far-IR
luminosities. We conclude that radio emission from host galaxies of RQ AGN in
this flux density regime result primarily from star formation activity.

coexistence between humans and robots. Robots undertake common tasks and
support the residents in their everyday life. People appreciate the presence of
robots in their environment as long as they keep the control over them. One
important aspect is the control of a robot's workspace. Therefore, we introduce
virtual borders to precisely and flexibly define the workspace of mobile
robots. First, we propose a novel framework that allows a person to
interactively restrict a mobile robot's workspace. To show the validity of this
framework, a concrete implementation based on visual markers is implemented.
Afterwards, the mobile robot is capable of performing its tasks while
respecting the new virtual borders. The approach is accurate, flexible and less
time consuming than explicit robot programming. Hence, even non-experts are
able to teach virtual borders to their robots which is especially interesting
in domains like vacuuming or service robots in home environments.

a problem that has attracted considerable interest of late. In particular, the
Hall effect has the potential to bring about remarkable changes in the

conduct a systematic examination of the linear eigenmodes in a weakly
magnetized differentially rotating gas with special focus on Hall diffusion. We
first develop a geometrical representation of the eigenmodes and provide a
detailed quantitative description of the polarization properties of the
oscillatory modes under the combined influence of the Coriolis and Hall
effects. We also analyze the effects of magnetic diffusion on the structure of
the unstable modes and derive analytical expressions for the kinetic and
magnetic stresses and energy densities associated with the non-ideal MRI. Our
analysis explicitly demonstrates that, if the dissipative effects are
relatively weak, the kinetic stresses and energies make up the dominant
contribution to the total stress and energy density when the equilibrium
angular momentum and magnetic field vectors are anti-parallel. This is in sharp
contrast to what is observed in the case of the ideal or dissipative MRI. We
conduct shearing box simulations and find very good agreement with the results
derived from linear analysis. As the modes in consideration are also exact
solutions of the non-linear equations, the unconventional nature of the kinetic
and magnetic stresses may have significant implications for the non-linear
evolution in some regions of protoplanetary disks.

Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med.
Biol., 1976, 733-744], the attenuation coefficient is approximated as a linear
combination of functions of energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on
the material composition at points within the object. The method then computes
the line integrals of the basis set coefficient from measurements with
different x-ray spectra. This paper shows that the transformation from photon
counting detector data with pileup to the line integrals can become
ill-conditioned under some circumstances leading to highly increased noise.
Methods: An idealized model that includes pileup and quantum noise is used. The
noise variance of the line integral estimates is computed using the
Cram{\`e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The CRLB is computed as a function of object
thickness for photon counting detector data with three and four bin pulse
height analysis (PHA) and low and high pileup. Results: With four bin PHA data
the transformation is well conditioned with either high or low pileup. With
three bin PHA and high pileup, the transformation becomes ill-conditioned for
specific values of object attenuation. At these values the CRLB variance
increases by approximately 10 5 compared with the four bin PHA or low pileup
results. The condition number of the forward transformation matrix also shows a
spike at those attenuation values. Conclusion: Designers of systems using
counting detectors should study the stability of the line integral estimator
output with their data.

L1-regularization by a horseshoe prior, which is well known to give aggressive
shrinkage of noise predictor while leaving the important signal essentially
untouched. This is especially important when a large number of rules are used
as predictors as many of them only contribute noise. Our horseshoe prior has an
additional hierarchical layer that applies more shrinkage a priori to rules
with a large number of splits, and to rules that are only satisfied by a few
observations. The aggressive noise shrinkage of our prior also makes it
possible to complement the rules from boosting in Friedman and Popescu (2008)

diversity to the ensemble. We sample from the posterior distribution using a

visibilities and the image under scrutiny. In algorithmic terms, it gives rise
to massive memory and computational time requirements. Yet, it can be a
blessing in terms of reconstruction quality of the sky image. In recent years,
several works have shown that large w-modulations promote the spread spectrum
effect. Within the compressive sensing framework, this effect increases the
incoherence between the sensing basis and the sparsity basis of the signal to
be recovered, leading to better estimation of the sky image. In this article,
we revisit the w-projection approach using convex optimisation in realistic
settings, where the measurement operator couples the w-terms in Fourier and the
de-gridding kernels. We provide sparse, thus fast, models of the Fourier part
of the measurement operator through adaptive sparsification procedures.
Consequently, memory requirements and computational cost are significantly
alleviated, at the expense of introducing errors on the radio-interferometric
data model. We present a first investigation of the impact of the sparse
variants of the measurement operator on the image reconstruction quality. We
finally analyse the interesting super-resolution potential associated with the
spread spectrum effect of the w-modulation, and showcase it through
simulations. Our C++ code is available online on GitHub.

phenomena. In many applications these phenomena are observed through a sensor
network, with the aim of inferring their underlying properties. Leveraging from
certain results in sampling and approximation theory, we present a new
framework for solving a class of inverse source problems for physical fields
governed by linear partial differential equations. Specifically, we demonstrate
that the unknown field sources can be recovered from a sequence of, so called,
generalised measurements by using multidimensional frequency estimation
techniques. Next we show that---for physics-driven fields---this sequence of
generalised measurements can be estimated by computing a linear weighted-sum of
the sensor measurements; whereby the exact weights (of the sums) correspond to
those that reproduce multidimensional exponentials, when used to linearly
combine translates of a particular prototype function related to the Green's
function of our underlying field. Explicit formulae are then derived for the
sequence of weights, that map sensor samples to the exact sequence of
generalised measurements when the Green's function satisfies the generalised
Strang-Fix condition. Otherwise, the same mapping yields a close approximation
of the generalised measurements. Based on this new framework we develop
practical, noise robust, sensor network strategies for solving the inverse
source problem, and then present numerical simulation results to verify their
performance.

optimize for interparticle interactions that self-assemble particles into a

that lead to self-assembly of each of the desired morphologies, including
several types of potentials that were not previously understood to be capable
of stabilizing such systems. One such pair potential led to assembly of the
highly asymmetric truncated trihexagonal lattice and another produced a fluid
containing spherical voids, or pores, of designed size via purely repulsive

inherent to this particular design approach including the use of a parametrized

difference causes the precarious and, respectively, robust antiferromagnetic
phase of these cuprates. The same sensitivities affect the doping dependence of
the incommensurability of density waves, $\delta (x)$. In the hole-doped
compounds this gives rise to a doping offset for magnetic and charge density
waves, $\delta_{m,c}^p(x) \propto \sqrt{x-x_{0p}^N}$. Here $x_{0p}^N$ is the
doping concentration where the N\'{e}el temperature vanishes, $T_N(x_{0p}^N) =

concentration $y$ causes a different doping offset in the latter case,
$\delta_{m,c}^n(x) \propto \sqrt{x- 2y}$. The square-root formulas result from
the assumption of superlattice formation through partitioning of the $CuO_2$

disturbances. Each of these is an exact, monochromatic solution of Maxwell's
equations in free space with looped electric and magnetic field lines of finite
extent and a localised appearance in all three spatial dimensions. Included are
the first explicit examples of monochromatic electromagnetic knots. We also
consider the generation of our unusual electromagnetic disturbances in the
laboratory, at both low and high frequencies, and highlight possible directions
for future research, including the use of unusual electromagnetic disturbances
as the basis of a new form of three-dimensional display.

system for human-robotic networks with inter-robot communication delays. We
first design a cooperative controller to be implemented on each robot so that
their motion are synchronized to a reference motion desired by a human
operator, and then point out that each robot motion ensures passivity.
Inter-robot communication channels are then designed via so-called scattering
transformation which is a technique to passify the delayed channel. The
resulting robotic network is then connected with human operator based on
passivity theory. In order to demonstrate the present control architecture, we
build an experimental testbed consisting of multiple robots and a tablet. In
particular, we analyze the effects of the communication delays on the human
operator's behavior.

carries detailed information about the physical properties of the stellar
population that gave rise to the explosion, and thus the progenitor itself.
Here, we present new observations of ESO184-G82, the galaxy hosting the
archetype of the $\gamma$-ray burst/supernova connection, GRB 980425/SN 1998bw,
obtained with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE mounted at the Very Large
Telescope. These observations have yielded detailed maps of emission-line
strength for various nebular lines, as well as physical parameters such as dust
extinction, stellar age, and oxygen abundance on spatial scales of 160 pc. The
immediate environment of GRB 980425 is young (5-8 Myr) and consistent with a
mildly-extinguished ($A_V\sim0.1\ \mathrm{mag}$) progenitor of zero-age
main-sequence mass between 25 $M_{\odot}$ and 40 $M_{\odot}$ and oxygen
abundance 12+log(O/H)~8.2 ($Z\sim0.3\ {Z}_\odot$), which is slightly lower than
the one of an integrated measurement of the galaxy (12+log(O/H)~8.3) and a
prominent nearby HII region (12+log(O/H)~8.4). This region is significantly
younger than the explosion site, and we argue that a scenario in which the GRB
progenitor formed in this environment and was subsequently ejected appears very
unlikely. We show that empirical strong-line methods based on [OIII] and/or
[NII] are inadequate to produce accurate maps of oxygen abundance at the level
of detail of our MUSE observation as these methods strongly depend on the
ionization state of the gas. The metallicity gradient in ESO184-G82 is -0.06
dex kpc$^{-1}$, indicating that the typical offsets of at most few kpc for
cosmological GRBs on average have a small impact on oxygen abundance
measurements at higher redshift.

macroscopic parts of a fully isolated system in thermal equilibrium move as if
points of a rigid body, macroscopic energy being dissipated to increase
internal energy, and increase entropy along. It appears particularly important
in Space physics, when dissipation involves long-range fields at
Electromagnetism and Gravitation, rather than short-range contact forces. It is
shown how new physics, Special Relativity as regards Electromagnetism, first
Newtonian theory then General Relativity as regards Gravitation, determine
different dissipative processes involved in the approach to that equilibrium.

neutron, and Lambda baryons as input, the magnetic moments of the up, down, and
strange quarks, and by extension those of the remaining octet baryons, depend
on the value of the deformation parameter q. Plotting the least square error as
a function of q we find the undeformed value q=1 is a local maximum. Nearby are
a relative minimum (at q=0.610) and an absolute minimum (at q=1.774). The value
q=1.774 gives an approximately 10% decrease in the least square error compared
to the undeformed case. For this value of q the quark masses of the up and down
quarks are calculated to be 331 MeV and 305 MeV respectively.
