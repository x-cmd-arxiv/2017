First we discuss
fundamental concepts of electron transfer and transport in and across proteins
and proposed mechanisms for these processes. We then describe the
immobilization of proteins to solid-state surfaces in both nanoscale and
macroscopic approaches, and highlight how different methodologies can alter
protein electronic properties. Because immobilizing proteins while retaining
biological activity is crucial to the successful development of bioelectronic
devices, we discuss this process at length. We briefly discuss computational
predictions and their link to experimental results. We then summarize how the
biological activity of immobilized proteins is beneficial for bioelectronics
devices, and how conductance measurements can shed light on protein properties.
Finally, we consider how the research to date could influence the development
of future bioelectronics devices.

fluctuates between two stochastic bounds generated by its inherent stochastic
volatility process. This brings better accuracy and is consistent with the
observed volatility path such as for the VIX as a proxy for instance. We apply
the regular perturbation analysis upon the worst case scenario price, and
derive the first order approximation in the regime of slowly varying stochastic
bounds. The original problem which involves solving a fully nonlinear PDE in

nonlinear PDE in dimension one and a linear PDE with source, which gives a
tremendous computational advantage. Numerical experiments show that this

whose components are each regularized by the (discrete) total variation of

results in $k$th degree piecewise polynomial components, (e.g., $k=0$ gives
piecewise constant components, $k=1$ gives piecewise linear, $k=2$ gives
piecewise quadratic, etc.). Analogous to its advantages in the univariate case,
additive trend filtering has favorable theoretical and computational
properties, thanks in large part to the localized nature of the (discrete)
total variation regularizer that it uses. On the theory side, we derive fast
error rates for additive trend filtering estimates, and show these rates are
minimax optimal when the underlying function is additive and has component
functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation. We also show that these
rates are unattainable by additive smoothing splines (and by additive models
built from linear smoothers, in general). On the computational side, as per the
standard in additive models, backfitting is an appealing method for
optimization, but it is particularly appealing for additive trend filtering
because we can leverage a few highly efficient univariate trend filtering
solvers. Going one step further, we describe a new backfitting algorithm whose
iterations can be run in parallel, which (as far as we know) is the first of

investigate, how both, the TMS voltage and the TMS effect, depend on the size,
position and intensity of the applied laser spot. For this study, a large
variety of different temperature distributions was created across the junction.
We recorded two-dimensional maps of voltages generated by heating in dependence
of the laser spot position and the corresponding calculated TMS values. The
voltages change in value and sign, from large positive values when heating the
MTJ directly in the centre to small values when heating the junction on the
edges and even small negative values when heating the sample away from the

systematic analysis shows, that the distribution of the temperature gradient is
essential, to achieve high voltage signals and reasonable resulting TMS ratios.
Furthermore, artefacts on the edges produce misleading results, but also open
up further possibilities of more complex heating scenarios for
spincaloritronics in spintronic devices.

that bypasses the need for model sparsity and makes implementation easy in

  Like NoBackTrack, UORO provides unbiased gradient estimates; unbiasedness is
the core hypothesis in stochastic gradient descent theory, without which
convergence to a local optimum is not guaranteed. On the contrary, truncated
BPTT does not provide this property, leading to possible divergence.
  On synthetic tasks where truncated BPTT is shown to diverge, UORO converges.
For instance, when a parameter has a positive short-term but negative long-term

significantly longer than the intrinsic temporal range of the interactions,

single cluster model from where the thermodynamics is analyzed by exact
diagonalization. We found that the presence of GF can introduce cluster
freezing at very low levels of disorder. The system exhibits an entropy plateau
followed by a large entropy drop close to the freezing temperature. In this
scenario, a spin-liquid (SL) behavior prevents conventional long-range order,
but an infinitesimal disorder picks out uncompensated cluster states from the
multi degenerate SL regime, potentializing the intercluster disordered coupling
and bringing the cluster spin-glass state. To summarize, our results suggest
that the SL state combined with low levels of disorder can activate small
clusters, providing hypersensitivity to the freezing process in geometrically
frustrated materials and playing a key role in the glassy stabilization. We
propose that this physical mechanism could be present in several geometrically

interacting proteins. Communication between these proteins is mediated by
signaling molecules which bind to receptors and induce stochastic transitions
between different conformational states. Signaling is typically a cooperative
process which requires the occurrence of multiple binding events so that
reaction rates have a nonlinear dependence on the amount of signaling molecule.
It is this nonlinearity that endows biological signaling networks with robust
switch-like properties which are critical to their biological function. In this
study, we investigate how the properties of these signaling systems depend on
the network architecture. Our main result is that these nonlinear networks
exhibit bistability where the network activity can switch between states that
correspond to a low and high activity level. We show that this bistable regime
emerges at a critical coupling strength that is determined by the spectral
structure of the network. In particular, the set of nodes that correspond to
large components of the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix determines
the onset of bistability. Above this transition, the eigenvectors of the
adjacency matrix determine a hierarchy of clusters, defined by its spectral
properties, which are activated sequentially with increasing network activity.
We argue further that the onset of bistability occurs either continuously or
discontinuously depending upon whether the leading eigenvector is localized or
delocalized. Finally, we show that at low network coupling stochastic
transitions to the active branch are also driven by the set of nodes that
contribute more strongly to the leading eigenvector.

characterization of habitable planets. These exo-Earths can be easily found
around low-mass stars by using either photometric transit or radial-velocity
(RV) techniques. In the latter case the gain is twofold because the signal
induced by the planet of a given mass is higher due to the more favourable
planet-star mass ratio and because the habitable zone lies closer to the star.
However, late-type stars emit mainly in the infrared (IR) wavelength range,
which calls for IR instruments. SPIRou is a stable RV IR spectrograph
addressing these ambitious scientific objectives. As with any other
spectrograph, calibration and drift monitoring is fundamental to achieve high
precision. Our goal was to build, test and finally operate a
Fabry-P\'erot-based RV-reference module able to provide the needed spectral
information over the full wavelength range of SPIRou. We adapted the existing
HARPS Fabry-P\'erot calibrator for operation in the IR domain. After
manufacturing and assembly, we characterized the FP RV-module in the

system. The measured finesse value of F=12.8 corresponds perfectly to the
theoretical value. The total transmittance at peak is of the order of 0.5%,
mainly limited by fibre-connectors and interfaces. Nevertheless, the provided
flux is in line with the the requirements set by the SPIRou instrument. Once
installed on SPIRou, we will test the full spectral characteristics and

that RNs can act as a bottleneck that induces the factorization of objects from
entangled scene description inputs, and from distributed deep representations

decreasing with varying slopes towards zero correlation over a range of one

mathematical objects such as natural numbers (not on their symbolic
representations) and their `symbolic implementations' that define their
`computability', which sheds new light on the very concept of computation. This
work is intended to be a stepping stone towards a new mathematical foundation
of computation, intuitionistic logic and constructive mathematics.

  Information Retrieval","submitted to ISIT 2017",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of a Private Information Retrieval (PIR) code was recently
introduced by Fazeli, Vardy and Yaakobi who showed that this class of codes
permit PIR at reduced levels of storage overhead in comparison with
replicated-server PIR. In the present paper, the construction of an $(n,k)$
$\tau$-server binary, linear PIR code having parameters $n = \sum\limits_{i =
0}^{\ell} {m \choose i}$, $k = {m \choose \ell}$ and $\tau = 2^{\ell}$ is
presented. These codes are obtained through homogeneous-polynomial evaluation
and correspond to the binary, Projective Reed Muller (PRM) code. The
construction can be extended to yield PIR codes for any $\tau$ of the form
$2^{\ell}$, $2^{\ell}-1$ and any value of $k$, through a combination of
single-symbol puncturing and shortening of the PRM code. Each of these code
constructions above, have smaller storage overhead in comparison with other PIR
codes appearing in the literature.
  For the particular case of $\tau=3,4$, we show that the codes constructed
here are optimal, systematic PIR codes by providing an improved lower bound on
the block length $n(k, \tau)$ of a systematic PIR code. It follows from a
result by Vardy and Yaakobi, that these codes also yield optimal, systematic
primitive multi-set $(n, k, \tau)_B$ batch codes for $\tau=3,4$. The PIR code
constructions presented here also yield upper bounds on the generalized Hamming
weights of binary PRM codes.

such as face modeling, recognition and verification. In this paper, we present
an iterative method for Keypoint Estimation and Pose prediction of
unconstrained faces by Learning Efficient H-CNN Regressors (KEPLER) for
addressing the face alignment problem. Recent state of the art methods have
shown improvements in face keypoint detection by employing Convolution Neural
Networks (CNNs). Although a simple feed forward neural network can learn the
mapping between input and output spaces, it cannot learn the inherent
structural dependencies. We present a novel architecture called H-CNN
(Heatmap-CNN) which captures structured global and local features and thus
favors accurate keypoint detecion. HCNN is jointly trained on the visibility,
fiducials and 3D-pose of the face. As the iterations proceed, the error
decreases making the gradients small and thus requiring efficient training of
DCNNs to mitigate this. KEPLER performs global corrections in pose and
fiducials for the first four iterations followed by local corrections in the
subsequent stage. As a by-product, KEPLER also provides 3D pose (pitch, yaw and
roll) of the face accurately. In this paper, we show that without using any 3D
information, KEPLER outperforms state of the art methods for alignment on
challenging datasets such as AFW and AFLW.

to the purely singular setting. - When Y has non-positive curvature in the
sense of Alexandrov (NPC), we show that the ideas of Jost [40] and Lin [52] can

theorem of Mayer [57] on the existence of the harmonic mapping flow and solve
the corresponding initial boundary value problem. Combing these known ideas,
with the more or less standard techniques from analysis on metric spaces based
on upper gradients, leads to new results when we consider harmonic mappings
from RCD(K,N) spaces into NPC spaces. One advantage of this type of
axiomatization is that it works for minimizers of other Dirichlet energy

and quickly acquiring situation awareness might be matters of life and death.
Hence, the use of robots in such scenarios has been restricted by the time
needed to explore and build a map. One way to speed up exploration and mapping
is to reason about unknown parts of the environment using prior information.
While previous research on using external priors for robot mapping mainly
focused on accurate maps or aerial images, such data are not always possible to
get, especially indoor. We focus on emergency maps as priors for robot mapping
since they are easy to get and already extensively used by firemen in rescue
missions. However, those maps can be outdated, information might be missing,
and the scales of rooms are typically not consistent. We have developed a
formulation of graph-based SLAM that incorporates information from an emergency
map. The graph-SLAM is optimized using a combination of robust kernels, fusing
the emergency map and the robot map into one map, even when faced with scale
inaccuracies and inexact start poses. We typically have more than 50% of wrong
correspondences in the settings studied in this paper, and the method we
propose correctly handles them. Experiments in an office environment show that
we can handle up to 70% of wrong correspondences and still get the expected
result. The robot can navigate and explore while taking into account places it
has not yet seen. We demonstrate this in a test scenario and also show that the
emergency map is enhanced by adding information not represented such as closed
doors or new walls.

surveys can provide strong constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity through
the scale-dependent halo bias. To fully exploit the information from galaxy
surveys, optimal analysis methods need to be developed and applied to the data.
Since the halo bias is sensitive to local non-Gaussianity predominately at
large scales, the volume of a given survey is crucial. Consequently, for such
analyses we do not want to split into redshift bins, which would lead to
information loss due to edge effects, but instead analyse the full sample. We
present an optimal technique to directly constrain local non-Gaussianity
parametrised by $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{loc}$, from galaxy clustering by
applying redshift weights to the galaxies. We derive a set of weights to
optimally measure the amplitude of local non-Gaussianity,
$f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{loc}$, discuss the redshift weighted power spectrum
estimators, outline the implementation procedure and test our weighting scheme
against Lognormal catalogs for two different surveys: the quasar sample of the
Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the emission line
galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We
find an improvement of 30 percent for eBOSS and 6 percent for DESI compared to
the standard Feldman, Kaiser $\&$ Peacock weights, although these predictions
are sensitive to the bias model assumed.

effective Einstein radius of $\theta_{E}\sim42$"". The model suggests the
critical area will expand to 2.58 arcmin$^{2}$ ($\theta_{E}\sim54$"") for

charged particle tracks in a large volume covering a solid angle of almost
$4\pi$. The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task
of pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides
particle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.
For these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)
amplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion
collisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the
order of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is
mandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting
back into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of
subsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a
conventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be
applied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals
is the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change
of paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification
region, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data
handling. A mandatory prerequisite for such an operation is a sufficiently good
suppression of the ion backflow from the avalanche region, which otherwise
limits the tracking and particle identification capabilities of such a
detector. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) are a promising candidate to combine
excellent spatial resolution with an intrinsic suppression of ions. In this
paper we describe the design, construction and the commissioning of a large TPC
with GEM amplification and without gating grid (GEM-TPC).

constrain the evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM) over the past ~10 Gyr.
We find that the bulk of the ICM has evolved self similarly over the full
redshift range probed here, with the ICM density at r>0.2R500 scaling like
E(z)^2. In the centers of clusters (r<0.1R500), we find significant deviations
from self similarity (n_e ~ E(z)^{0.1+/-0.5}), consistent with no redshift
dependence. When we isolate clusters with over-dense cores (i.e., cool cores),
we find that the average over-density profile has not evolved with redshift --
that is, cool cores have not changed in size, density, or total mass over the
past ~9-10 Gyr. We show that the evolving ""cuspiness"" of clusters in the X-ray,
reported by several previous studies, can be understood in the context of a
cool core with fixed properties embedded in a self similarly-evolving cluster.
We find no measurable evolution in the X-ray morphology of massive clusters,
seemingly in tension with the rapidly-rising (with redshift) rate of major
mergers predicted by cosmological simulations. We show that these two results
can be brought into agreement if we assume that the relaxation time after a
merger is proportional to the crossing time, since the latter is proportional
to H(z)^(-1).

molecular mass-loss rate of the order of $10^{-9}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. On the
other hand, if the radio continuum flux detected is generated as a consequence

one dimension. In this limit, a polaronic-like behaviour is not expected, and
the physics is that of a magnon or impurity. While the charge degrees of
freedom of the system are frozen, the resulting tight-binding Hamiltonian for
the impurity's spin exhibits an intriguing structure that strongly depends on
the filling factor of the lattice potential. This filling dependency also
transfers to the nature of the interactions for the case of two magnons and the
important spin balanced case. At low filling, and up until near unit filling,
the single impurity Hamiltonian faithfully reproduces a single-band,
quasi-homogeneous tight-binding problem. As the filling is increased and the
second band of the single particle spectrum of the periodic potential is
progressively filled, the impurity Hamiltonian, at low energies, describes a
single particle trapped in a multi-well potential. Interestingly, once the
first two bands are fully filled, the impurity Hamiltonian is a near-perfect
realisation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our studies, which go well
beyond the single-band approximation, that is, the Hubbard model, pave the way
for the realisation of interacting one-dimensional models of condensed matter

multiple simulations, we assess the consistency of the theoretical results.
Comparisons to binary merger simulations show that low-mass lenticular galaxies

events. We find, however, that recent mergers cannot be ruled out for some

crucial players in star and galaxy formation, but it has proven remarkably
difficult to use observations of them to determine physical properties of
interest, particularly mass fluxes. Much of the difficulty stems from a lack of
a theory that links a physically-realistic model for winds' density, velocity,
and covering factors to calculations of light emission and absorption. In this
paper we provide such a model. We consider a wind launched from a turbulent
region with a range of column densities, derive the differential acceleration
of gas as a function of column density, and use this result to compute winds'
absorption profiles, emission profiles, and emission intensity maps in both
optically thin and optically thick species. The model is sufficiently simple
that all required computations can be done analytically up to straightforward
numerical integrals, rendering it suitable for the problem of deriving physical
parameters by fitting models to observed data. We show that our model produces
realistic absorption and emission profiles for some example cases, and argue
that the most promising methods of deducing mass fluxes are based on
combinations of absorption lines of different optical depths, or on combining
absorption with measurements of molecular line emission. In the second paper in
this series, we expand on these ideas by introducing a set of observational
diagnostics that are significantly more robust that those commonly in use, and
that can be used to obtain improved estimates of wind properties.

very diverse stellar properties reveal a relation between the radial
acceleration purely due to the baryonic matter and the one inferred directly
from the observed rotation curves. Assuming the dark matter (DM) exists, this
acceleration relation is tantamount to an acceleration relation between DM and
baryons. This leads us to a universal maximum acceleration for all halos. Using
the latter in DM profiles that predict inner cores implies that the central
surface density $\mu_{DM} = \rho_s r_s$ must be a universal constant, as
suggested by previous studies in selected galaxies, revealing a strong
correlation between the density $\rho_s$ and scale $r_s$ parameters in each
profile. We then explore the consequences of the constancy of $\mu_{DM}$ in the
context of the ultra-light scalar field dark matter model (SFDM). We find that
for this model $\mu_{DM} = 648 \, M_\odot {\rm pc}^{-2}$, and that the
so-called WaveDM soliton profile should be an universal feature of the DM
halos. Comparing with data from the Milky Way and Andromeda satellites, we find
that they are consistent with a boson mass of the scalar field particle of the
order of $10^{-21} \, {\rm eV}/c^2$, which puts the SFDM model in agreement

transitional disks showing asymmetric features in scattered light and thermal
emission. Near-infrared scattered-light images revealed two bright outer spiral
arms and an inner cavity depleted in dust. Giant protoplanets have been
proposed to account for the disk morphology. Aims. We aim to search for giant
planets responsible for the disk features and, in the case of non-detection, to
constrain recent planet predictions using the data detection limits. Methods.
We obtained new high-contrast and high-resolution total intensity images of the
target spanning the Y to the K bands (0.95-2.3 mic) using the VLT/SPHERE
near-infrared camera and integral field spectrometer. Results. The spiral arms
and the outer cavity edge are revealed at high resolutions and sensitivities
without the need for image post-processing techniques, which introduce
photometric biases. We do not detect any close-in companions. For the
derivation of the detection limits on putative giant planets embedded in the
disk, we show that the knowledge of the disk aspect ratio and viscosity is
critical for the estimation of the attenuation of a planet signal by the
protoplanetary dust because of the gaps that these putative planets may open.
Given assumptions on these parameters, the mass limits can vary from ~2-5 to
~4-7 Jupiter masses at separations beyond the disk spiral arms. The SPHERE
detection limits are more stringent than those derived from archival NaCo/L'
data and provide new constraints on a few recent predictions of massive planets
(4-15 MJ) based on the spiral density wave theory. The SPHERE and ALMA data do
not favor the hypotheses on massive giant planets in the outer disk (beyond
0.6). There could still be low-mass planets in the outer disk and/or planets
inside the cavity.

remnant planetary systems. However, they rarely have detectable debris
accretion discs, possibly because much of the influx is fast steeply-infalling
debris in star-grazing orbits, producing a more tenuous signature than a slowly
accreting disk. Processes governing such deposition between the Roche radius
and photosphere have so far received little attention and we model them here
analytically by extending recent work on sun-grazing comets to WD systems. We
find that the evolution of cm-to-km size (a_0) infallers most strongly depends
on two combinations of parameters, which effectively measure sublimation rate
and binding strength. We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of
infallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of
hot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky
(strong, refractory) infallers. We find: (i) Total sublimation above the
photosphere befalls all small infallers across the entire WD temperature (T_WD)
range, the threshold size rising with T_WD and 100X larger for rock than snow.
(ii) All very large objects fragment tidally regardless of T_WD: for rock, a_0
>= 10^5 cm; for snow, a_0 >= 10^3 -- 3x10^4 cm across all WD cooling ages.
(iii) A considerable range of a_0 avoids fragmentation and total sublimation,
yielding impacts or grazes with cold WDs. This range narrows rapidly with
increasing T_WD, especially for snowy bodies. Finally, we discuss briefly how
the various forms of deposited debris may finally reach the photosphere surface
itself.

affected by desertification. Sand fences also provide a way to reduce the
emission rate of dust particles, which is triggered mainly by the impacts of
wind-blown sand grains onto the soil and affects the Earth's climate. Many
different types of fence have been designed and their effects on the sediment
transport dynamics studied since many years. However, the search for the
optimal array of fences has remained largely an empirical task. In order to
achieve maximal soil protection using the minimal amount of fence material, a
quantitative understanding of the flow profile over the relief encompassing the
area to be protected including all employed fences is required. Here we use
Computational Fluid Dynamics to calculate the average turbulent airflow through
an array of fences as a function of the porosity, spacing and height of the
fences. Specifically, we investigate the factors controlling the fraction of
soil area over which the basal average wind shear velocity drops below the
threshold for sand transport when the fences are applied. We introduce a cost
function, given by the amount of material necessary to construct the fences. We
find that, for typical sand-moving wind velocities, the optimal fence height
(which minimizes this cost function) is around $50\,$cm, while using fences of
height around $1.25\,$m leads to maximal cost.

with the accretion of dusty, planetary material. This work analyses the

that no more than 3.3% can have a wide, flat, opaque dust disc, extending to
the Roche radius, with a temperature at the disc inner edge of $T_{in} =
1,400$K, the standard model for the observed excesses. This is in stark
contrast to the incidence of pollution of about 30%. We present four potential
reasons for the absence of an infrared excess in polluted white dwarfs,
depending on their stellar properties and inferred accretion rates: i) their
dust discs are opaque, but narrow, thus evading detection if more than 85% of
polluted white dwarfs have dust discs narrower than $\delta r< 0.04r$, ii)
their dust discs have been fully consumed, which only works for the oldest
white dwarfs with sinking timescales longer than hundreds of years, iii) their
dust is optically thin, which can supply low accretion rates of $<10^7
$gs$^{-1}$ if dominated by PR-drag, and higher accretion rates, if inwards
transport of material is enhanced, for example due to the presence of gas, iv)
their accretion is supplied by a pure gas disc, which could result from the
sublimation of optically thin dust for T* > 20, 000K. Future observations
sensitive to faint infrared excesses or the presence of gas, can test the
scenarios presented here, thereby better constraining the nature of the

based on a high electron carrier density deduced from a Drude free electron
model fitted to the reflectivity of the sample. Based on our analysis of the
reflectivity data we find no convincing evidence for metallic hydrogen in their
published data. The pressure determination is also ambiguous - it should be
~630 GPa according to the presented Raman spectrum. For comparison, we present
our own data on the observation of highly reflecting hydrogen at pressures of
350-400 GPa. The appearance of metallic reflectivity is accompanied with a
finite electrical conductivity of the sample. We argue that the actual pressure

out by the low frequency instrument (SKA1-LOW) of the Square Kilometre Array
telescope (SKA), i.e., the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). The smoothness of the passband response of the current log-periodic
antenna being developed for the SKA1-LOW is analyzed using numerical
electromagnetic simulations. The amplitude variations over the frequency range
are characterized using low-order polynomials defined locally, in order to
study the impact of the passband smoothness in the instrument calibration and
CD/EoR Science. A solution is offered to correct a fast ripple found at 60~MHz
during a test campaign at the SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy
Observatory, Western Australia in September 2015 with a minor impact on the
telescope's performance and design. A comparison with the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array antenna is also shown demonstrating the potential use of the
SKA1-LOW antenna for the Delay Spectrum technique to detect the EoR.

  Our approach is to first address uniqueness issues arising in

harmonic oscillators. The topics are largely drawn from our efforts over the
past years, but we also present a few novel results. In the first part of this
review, we begin with a pedagogical introduction to the real-time dynamics of a
dissipative spin at both high and low temperatures. We then focus on the driven
dynamics in the quantum regime beyond the limit of weak spin-bath coupling. In
these situations, the non-perturbative stochastic Schroedinger equation method
is ideally suited to numerically obtain the spin dynamics as it can incorporate
bias fields $h_z(t)$ of arbitrary time-dependence in the Hamiltonian. We
present different recent applications of this method: (i) how topological
properties of the spin such as the Berry curvature and the Chern number can be
measured dynamically, and how dissipation affects the topology and the
measurement protocol, (ii) how quantum spin chains can experience
synchronization dynamics via coupling to a common bath. In the second part of
this review, we discuss quantum engineering of spin-boson and related models in
circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), quantum electrical circuits and
cold-atoms architectures. In different realizations, the Ohmic environment can
be represented by a long (microwave) transmission line, a Luttinger liquid, a
one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, a chain of superconducting Josephson
junctions. We show that the quantum impurity can be used as a quantum sensor to
detect properties of a bath at minimal coupling, and how dissipative spin
dynamics can lead to new insight in the Mott-Superfluid transition.

coronal mass ejections. In a failed filament eruption, the filament materials
usually show some ascending and falling motions as well as generate bright EUV
emissions. Here we report a failed filament eruption that occurred in a
quiet-Sun region observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory. In this event, the filament spreads out but gets
confined by the surrounding magnetic field. When interacting with the ambient
magnetic field, the filament material brightens up and flows along the magnetic
field lines through the corona to the chromosphere. We find that some materials
slide down along the lifting magnetic structure containing the filament and
impact the chromosphere to cause two ribbon-like brightenings in a wide
temperature range through kinetic energy dissipation. There is evidence
suggesting that magnetic reconnection occurs between the filament magnetic
structure and the surrounding magnetic fields where filament plasma is heated
to coronal temperatures. In addition, thread-like brightenings show up on top
of the erupting magnetic fields at low temperatures, which might be produced by
an energy imbalance from a fast drop of radiative cooling due to plasma
rarefaction. Thus, this single event of failed filament eruption shows
existence of a variety of plasma brightenings that may be caused by completely
different heating mechanisms.

fast-moving SN ejecta several years/decades after explosion depending on the
history of the mass-loss process acting in the progenitor star prior to

results in net emission in the Balmer-lines, especially in H-alpha. We look for
signs of late-time H-alpha emission in older Type Ia/Ibc/IIb SNe having

suggests that the variable emission is probably not due to nearby H II regions

ejecta-CSM interaction may take place in these systems. Moreover, we

elastic recovery, which is advantageous for a range of practical applications.
We attribute this response to the existence of supramolecular helices that
function as atomic-scale springs, storing mechanical energy during compressive
stress and hence inhibiting plastic deformation. Our results are consistent
with the relationship noted in [Cheng \& Cheng, \textit{Appl. Phys. Lett.},

instances have real-world significance or not. In this paper, we are interested
in the problem of specifically detecting anomalous instances that are known to
have high real-world utility, while ignoring the low-utility statistically
anomalous instances. To this end, we propose a novel method called Latent
Laplacian Maximum Entropy Discrimination (LatLapMED) as a potential solution.
This method uses the EM algorithm to simultaneously incorporate the Geometric
Entropy Minimization principle for identifying statistical anomalies, and the
Maximum Entropy Discrimination principle to incorporate utility labels, in
order to detect high-utility anomalies. We apply our method in both simulated
and real datasets to demonstrate that it has superior performance over existing
alternatives that independently pre-process with unsupervised anomaly detection
algorithms before classifying.

premixed Bunsen flame at a low global Lewis number are analyzed to address the
effects of the curvature on the local flame front. For this purpose, the
chemical kinetics is modeled according to a reduced scheme, involving 5
reactions and 7 species, to mimic a H$_{2}$/Air flame at equivalence ratio
$\phi=0.5$. An increase of the local temperature and reaction rate is found for
fronts elongated into the fresh gases (concave), while local quenching is
observed for fronts elongated in the opposite direction (convex), i.e. towards
the burnt mixture. Data show that the occurrence in the reaction region of
these super-reactive (concave fronts) and quenched zones (convex fronts) is
predominant compared to a behavior compatible with the corresponding
unstretched laminar flame. In particular, well inside the reaction region, the
probability density function of the OH radical concentration shows a bi-modal
shape with peaks corresponding to negative (concave) and positive (convex)
curvatures, while a locally flat front is less frequently detected. The two
states are associated with a higher and lower chemical activity with respect
the laminar case. Additional statistics conditioned to the local hydrogen
concentration provide further information on this dual-state dynamics and on
the differences with respect to the corresponding laminar unstretched flame
when moving from the fresh to the burnt gas regions. Finally we discuss the
effects of the turbulence on the thermo-diffusive instability showing that the
turbulent fluctuations, increasing the flame front corrugations, are
essentially responsible of the local flame quenching.

Across 10 experiments with 28 different parameter combinations, we evaluated
BubbleView on a variety of image types: information visualizations, natural

fixations collected with eye-trackers in controlled lab settings. We found that
BubbleView clicks can both (i) successfully approximate eye fixations on
different images, and (ii) be used to rank image and design elements by
importance. BubbleView is designed to collect clicks on static images, and
works best for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information

more consistent than related methodologies that use continuous mouse movements.
Our analyses validate the use of mouse-contingent, moving-window methodologies

bandwidth has drastically limited achievable data rates in conventional
ultrasonic implants, large spatial bandwidth can be exploited by using multiple
transducers in a multiple-input/multiple-output system to provide spatial
multiplexing gain without additional power, larger bandwidth, or complicated
packaging. We experimentally verify the communication link in mineral oil with
a transmitter and receiver 5 cm apart, each housing two custom-designed
mm-sized piezoelectric transducers operating at the same frequency. Two streams
of data modulated with quadrature phase-shift keying at 125 kbps are
simultaneously transmitted and received on both channels, effectively doubling
the data rate to 250 kbps with a measured bit error rate below 1e-4. We also
evaluate the performance and robustness of the channel separation network by
testing the communication link after introducing position offsets. These
results demonstrate the potential of spatial multiplexing to enable more
complex implant applications requiring higher data rates.

fields. In video surveillance, motion detection is an essential accompaniment
to activity recognition for early warning systems. Robotics also has much to
gain from motion detection and segmentation, particularly in high speed motion
tracking for tactile systems. There are a myriad of techniques for detecting
and masking motion in an image. Successful systems have used Gaussian Models to
discern background from foreground in an image (motion from static imagery).
However, particularly in the case of a moving camera or frame of reference, it
is necessary to compensate for the motion of the camera when attempting to
discern objects moving in the foreground. For example, it is possible to
estimate motion of the camera through optical flow methods or temporal
differencing and then compensate for this motion in a background subtraction
model. We selection a method by Yi et al. using Dual-Mode Single Gaussian
Models which does just this. We implement the technique in Intel's Thread

parallelization improvements with a theoretical analysis of speedups based on
the characteristics of our selected model and attributes of both TBB and CUDA.

removal of pulsational signals by sinusoidal fits. Clear transit-like events
were detected in KIC 5613330 and KIC 8197761. KIC 5613330 is a confirmed
exoplanet host (Kepler-635b), where the transit period determined here is
consistent with the literature value. KIC 8197761 is a $\gamma$ Doradus -
$\delta$ Scuti star exhibiting eclipses/transits occurring every 9.8686667(27)
d, having durations of 8.37 h, and causing brightness drops $\frac{\Delta F}{F}
= 0.00629(29)$. The star's pulsation spectrum contains several mode doublets
and triplets, identified as $l = 1$, with a mean spacing of 0.001659(15) c/d,
implying an internal rotation period of $301\pm3$ d. Trials to calculate the
size of the light travel time effect (LTTE) from the pulsations to constrain
the companion's mass ended inconclusive. Finding planets around $\gamma$
Doradus stars from the pulsational LTTE, therefore, is concluded to be
unrealistic. Spectroscopic monitoring of KIC 8197761 revealed sinusoidal radial
velocity variations with a semi-amplitude of $19.75 \pm 0.32$ km/s, while
individual spectra present rotational broadening consistent with $v \sin i =
9\pm1$ km/s. This suggests that the stellar surface rotation is synchronized
with the orbit, whereas the stellar core rotates $\sim$30 times slower.
Combining the observed radial velocity variability with the transit photometry,
constrains the companion's mass to be $\approx 0.28$ M$_{\odot}$, ruling out an
exoplanet hypothesis.

atmospheric neutrino data from the DeepCore detector in the energy range of

Neutrino Observatory. The standard three-neutrino paradigm can be probed by
adding an additional light ($\Delta m_{41}^2 \sim 1 \mathrm{\ eV^2}$) sterile
neutrino. Sterile neutrinos do not interact through the standard weak
interaction, and therefore cannot be directly detected. However, their mixing
with the three active neutrino states leaves an imprint on the standard
atmospheric neutrino oscillations for energies below 100 GeV. A search for such
mixing via muon neutrino disappearance is presented here. The data are found to
be consistent with the standard three neutrino hypothesis. Therefore we derive

$|U_{\tau4}|^2 < 0.15 $ (90% C.L.) for the sterile neutrino mass splitting

(MATA) confidence interval put forward by Turek and Fletcher, 2012. The
performance of this interval depends greatly on the data-based model weights on
which it is based. A computationally convenient formula for the coverage
probability of this interval is provided by Kabaila, Welsh and Abeysekera,
2016, in the simple scenario of two nested linear regression models. We
consider the more complicated scenario that there are many (32,768 in the
example considered) linear regression models obtained as follows. For each of a
specified set of components of the regression parameter vector, we either set
the component to zero or let it vary freely. We provide an easily-computed
upper bound on the minimum coverage probability of the MATA confidence

experimentally, it has been established that by fine-tuning the Rashba $\alpha$

$\alpha=\beta$, the total SO field becomes unidirectional thus rendering the
electron spins immune to dephasing due to momentum scattering. A robust
persistent spin helix (PSH) has already been experimentally realized at this
singular point $\alpha=\beta$. Here we employ the suppression of weak
antilocalization as a sensitive detector for matched SO fields together with a
technique that allows for independent electrical control over the SO couplings
via top gate voltage $V_T$ and back gate voltage $V_B$. We demonstrate for the
first time the gate control of $\beta$ and the $\it{continuous\,locking}$ of
the SO fields at $\alpha=\beta$, i.e., we are able to vary both $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ controllably and continuously with $V_T$ and $V_B$, while keeping them
locked at equal strengths. This makes possible a new concept: ""stretchable
PSHs"", i.e., helical spin patterns with continuously variable pitches $P$ over
a wide parameter range. The extracted spin-diffusion lengths and decay times as
a function of $\alpha/\beta$ show a significant enhancement near
$\alpha/\beta=1$. Since within the continuous-locking regime quantum transport
is diffusive (2D) for charge while ballistic (1D) for spin and thus amenable to
coherent spin control, stretchable PSHs could provide the platform for the much
heralded long-distance communication $\sim 8 - 25$ $\mu$m between solid-state

(SC) decoding are coupled. However, existing concatenation schemes of polar
codes with other error correction codes rarely take this coupling effect into
consideration. To achieve a better error performance of concatenated systems
with polar codes as inner codes, one can divide all bits in an outer block into
different polar blocks to completely de-correlate the possible coupled errors
in the transmitter side. We call this interleaving a blind interleaving (BI)
which serves as a benchmark. Two BI schemes, termed BI-DP and BI-CDP, are
proposed in the paper. To better balance performance, memory size, and the
decoding delay from the de-interleaving, a novel interleaving scheme, named the
correlation-breaking interleaving (CBI), is proposed. The CBI breaks the
correlated information bits based on the error correlation pattern proposed and
proven in this paper. The proposed CBI scheme is general in the sense that any
error correction code can serve as the outer code. In this paper, Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and BCH codes are used as two examples of the outer
codes of the interleaving scheme. The CBI scheme 1) can keep the simple SC
polar decoding while achieving a better error performance than the
state-of-the-art (SOA) direct concatenation of polar codes with LDPC codes and
BCH codes; 2) achieves a comparable error performance as the BI-DP scheme with
a smaller memory size and a shorter decoding delay. Numerical results are

density functional theory interaction potentials with molecular dynamics
simulation (DFT-MD) and isolate the effects of charge and cavitation, comparing
to the Born (linear response) model. We show that using uncorrected Ewald

and that charging free energies for cations are approximately linear as a
function of charge but that there is a small non-linearity for small anions.
The charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) for hard spheres, determined with quantum

glassy nanoclusters formed both through the direct condensation of the vapor
below the glass transition temperature, without the presence of a substrate,
and \textit{via} the slow supercooling of unsupported liquid nanodroplets. An
analysis of local structure using Voronoi polyhedra shows that the energetic
stability of the clusters is characterized by a large, increasing fraction of
bicapped square antiprism motifs. We also show that nanoclusters with similar
inherent structure energies are structurally similar, independent of their
history, which suggests the supercooled clusters access the same low energy
regions of the potential energy landscape as the vapor condensed clusters
despite their different methods of formation. By measuring the intermediate
scattering function at different radii from the cluster center, we find that
the relaxation dynamics of the clusters are inhomogeneous, with the core
becoming glassy above the glass transition temperature while the surface
remains mobile at low temperatures. This helps the clusters sample the highly
stable, low energy structures on the potential energy surface. Our work
suggests the nanocluster systems are structurally more stable than the
ultra-stable glassy thin films, formed through vapor deposition onto a cold
substrate, but the nanoclusters do not exhibit the superheating effects
characteristic of the ultra-stable glass states.

experimentally and numerically. Different from mirror, CFBG provides additional
frequency-dependent delay caused by dispersion, and thus induces
external-cavity modes with irregular mode separation rather than a fixed
separation induced by mirror feedback. Compared with mirror feedback, the CFBG
feedback can greatly depress and even eliminate the TDS, although it leads to a
similar quasi-period route to chaos with increases of feedback. In experiments,
by using a CFBG with dispersion of 2000ps/nm, the TDS is decreased by 90% to
about 0.04 compared with mirror feedback. Furthermore, both numerical and
experimental results show that the TDS evolution is quite different: the TDS
decreases more quickly down to a lower plateau (even background noise level of
autocorrelation function) and never rises again. This evolution tendency is
also different from that of FBG feedback, of which the TDS first decreases to a
minimal value and then increases again as feedback strength increases. In
addition, the CFBG feedback has no filtering effects and does not require

multisensor nonlinear dynamic systems. Compared with linear dynamic systems and
point estimation fusion in mean squared error sense, it is a more challenging
nonconvex optimization problem. Usually, to solve this problem, people try to
find an efficient or heuristic fusion algorithm. It is no doubt that an
analytical fusion formula should be much significant for rasing accuracy and
reducing computational burden. However, since it is a more complicated than the
convex quadratic optimization problem for linear point estimation fusion, it is
not easy to get the analytical fusion formula. In order to overcome the
difficulty of this problem, two popular fusion architectures are considered:
centralized and distributed set-membership information fusion. Firstly, both of
them can be converted into a semidefinite programming problem which can be
efficiently computed, respectively. Secondly, their analytical solutions can be
derived surprisingly by using decoupling technique. It is very interesting that
they are quite similar in form to the classic information filter. In the two
analytical fusion formulae, the information of each sensor can be clearly
characterized, and the knowledge of the correlation among measurement noises
across sensors are not required. Finally, multi-algorithm fusion is used to
minimize the size of the state bounding ellipsoid by complementary advantages
of multiple parallel algorithms. A typical numerical example in target tracking
demonstrates the effectiveness of the centralized, distributed, and
multi-algorithm set-membership fusion algorithms. In particular, it shows that
multi-algorithm fusion performs better than the centralized and distributed

techniques and combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, we construct
heuristic approaches for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) based on
embedding the relaxed discrete optimization problem into appropriate manifolds.
We explore multiple embedding techniques -- namely, the construction of new
dynamical systems on the manifold of orthogonal matrices and associated
Procrustes approximations of the TSP cost function. Using these dynamical
systems, we analyze the local neighborhood around the optimal TSP solutions
(which are equilibria) using computations to approximate the associated
\emph{stable manifolds}. We find that these flows frequently converge to
undesirable equilibria. However, the solutions of the dynamical systems and the
associated Procrustes approximation provide an interesting biasing approach for
the popular Lin--Kernighan heuristic which yields fast convergence. The
Lin--Kernighan heuristic is typically based on the computation of edges that
have a `high probability' of being in the shortest tour, thereby effectively
pruning the search space. Our new approach, instead, relies on a natural
relaxation of the combinatorial optimization problem to the manifold of
orthogonal matrices and the subsequent use of this solution to bias the
Lin--Kernighan heuristic. Although the initial cost of computing these edges
using the Procrustes solution is higher than existing methods, we find that the
Procrustes solution, when coupled with a homotopy computation, contains
valuable information regarding the optimal edges. We explore the Procrustes
based approach on several TSP instances and find that our approach often
requires fewer $k$-opt moves than existing approaches. Broadly, we hope that
this work initiates more work in the intersection of dynamical systems theory

showing that the current scaling with system-size is entirely governed by the

pulsars have been measured in unsurpassed detail in the eight years since the
launch of the hugely successful Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\gamma$-ray
mission. We performed geometric pulsar light curve modelling using static,
retarded vacuum, and offset polar cap (PC) dipole $B$-fields (the latter is
characterized by a parameter $\epsilon$), in conjunction with standard two-pole
caustic (TPC) and outer gap (OG) emission geometries. In addition to
constant-emissivity geometric models, we also considered a slot gap (SG)
$E$-field associated with the offset-PC dipole $B$-field and found that its
inclusion leads to qualitatively different light curves. We therefore find that
the assumed $B$-field and especially the $E$-field structure, as well as the
emission geometry (magnetic inclination and observer angles), have a great
impact on the pulsar's visibility and its high-energy pulse shape. We compared
our model light curves to the superior-quality $\gamma$-ray light curve of the
Vela pulsar (for energies $>100$ MeV). Our overall optimal light curve fit
(with the lowest $\chi^2$ value) is for the retarded vacuum dipole field and OG
model. We found that smaller values of $\epsilon$ are favoured for the
offset-PC dipole field when assuming constant emissivity, and larger $\epsilon$
values are favoured for variable emissivity, but not significantly so. When we
increased the relatively low SG $E$-fields we found improved light curve fits,
with the inferred pulsar geometry being closer to best fits from independent
studies in this case. In particular, we found that such a larger SG $E$-field
(leading to variable emissivity) gives a second overall best fit. This and
other indications point to the fact that the actual $E$-field may be larger
than predicted by the SG model.

observations is fundamental in many areas of science and engineering. The most
well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies
on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In
this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the
remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex
non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of
both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train
the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this
method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be
applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the
observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation
studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal
performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown.
Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and
non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the
analysis of measured brain signals.

influence upon the coefficients $A$ and $B$ before the square and the fourth

sequester significant amounts of present day atmospheric CO2. The reasons given
were that they originate in part from the pre-existing limestone; and that for
every mole of calcite precipitated, one mole of CO2 may be liberated to the
atmosphere. It was argued that only if the Ca+2 cation is derived from a
non-carbonate source can sequestration be assumed. We have tested these
assumptions under field conditions at two semi-arid sites in Israel. We found
that bicarbonate, originating from root exhalation, is depleted and is
incorporated within the USZ as carbonates precipitate. Thus, a net
sequestration of atmospheric CO2 does occur under semi-arid forests. Moreover,
most of the CO2 liberated in the precipitation reaction may remain in the soil.
And Ca+2 in the sediment may also be supplied from sources other than
pre-existing calcite. Forestation can therefore augment pedogenic carbonate
formation. By extrapolating our data globally, we suggest that worldwide
semi-arid forests (existing and to be planted) may sequester 5-20% of the
current annual anthropogenic increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide as
pedogenic carbonate.

LTE-Advanced. This improved user experience is achieved by Carrier Aggregation
(CA), in which the available spectrum of an operator is bundled out of several
frequency bands. Accordingly, the user equipment has to supply multiple
reception chains and therefore consumes considerably more power during a
transmission. On the other hand, transmissions terminate faster, which enables
a quick switchover into energy-saving mode. In order to examine these opposed
facts, empirical analyses of existing devices are first carried out.
Subsequently, we present a new CA enhancement of an existing context-aware
power consumption model which incorporates the development density of the
environment and the mobile device mobility. Based on the extended model we
perform a detailed power consumption analysis and show that CA leads to power
savings of 31% if the data rate doubled for large file transmissions. In
addition, we show that CA can lead to power savings even from a data rate
increase of 25%, regardless of mobility and urban development density. Besides,
the measurement results show that CA operated in the same band leads to a lower
power consumption than inter-band CA.

involves normalizing the signal by its own envelope, which is a nonlinear
operation that introduces broad spectral leakage. We review how this generates
bias and complicates the interpretation of commonly used measures of phase
locking. A specific example of this effect may create spurious phase locking as
a consequence of nonzero circular mean in the phase of input signals, which can
be viewed as spectral leakage to 0 Hz. Corrections for this problem which
recenter or uniformize the distribution of phase may fail when the amplitudes
of the compared signals are correlated. To address the more general problem of

high electrical conductance (a consequence of an optical band gap suitable for
PV conversion!) and low stability under high applied bias voltage. This
excludes normal measurements of a ferroelectric hysteresis loop to prove
ferroelctricity s hallmark for switchable polarization. By adopting an approach
suitable for electrically leaky materials as MAPbI3, we show here ferroelectric
hysteresis from well-characterized single crystals at low temperature (still
within the tetragonal phase, which is the room temperature stable phase). Using
chemical etching, we also image polar domains, the structural fingerprint for

accounting for the presence of substructures, the mass estimate of Abell 315
from kinematics is reduced by a factor 4, down to M200=0.8 (-0.4,+0.6) x 10^14
Msun. We also find evidence that the cluster mass concentration is unusually
low, c200=r200/r-2 <~ 1. Using our new estimate of c200 we revise the weak
lensing mass estimate down to M200=1.8 (-0.9,+1.7) x 10^14 Msun. Our new mass
estimates are in agreement with that derived from the cluster X-ray luminosity
via a scaling relation, M200=0.9+-0.2 x 10^14 Msun. Abell 315 no longer belongs
to the class of X-ray underluminous clusters. Its mass estimate was inflated by
the presence of an undetected subcluster in collision with the main cluster.
Whether the presence of undetected line-of-sight structures can be a general
explanation for all X-ray underluminous clusters remains to be explored using a
statistically significant sample.

(MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, multiple transmitters (TXs) each
with one single coil are used to enhance the efficiency of simultaneous power
transfer to multiple single-coil receivers (RXs) by constructively combining
their induced magnetic fields at the RXs, a technique termed ""magnetic
beamforming"". In this paper, we study the optimal magnetic beamforming design
in a multi-user MIMO MRC-WPT system. We introduce the multi-user power region
that constitutes all the achievable power tuples for all RXs, subject to the
given total power constraint over all TXs as well as their individual peak
voltage and current constraints. We characterize each boundary point of the
power region by maximizing the sum-power deliverable to all RXs subject to
their minimum harvested power constraints. For the special case without the TX
peak voltage and current constraints, we derive the optimal TX current
allocation for the single-RX setup in closed-form as well as that for the
multi-RX setup. In general, the problem is a non-convex quadratically
constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which is difficult to solve. For the
case of one single RX, we show that the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the
problem is tight. For the general case with multiple RXs, based on SDR we
obtain two approximate solutions by applying time-sharing and randomization,
respectively. Moreover, for practical implementation of magnetic beamforming,
we propose a novel signal processing method to estimate the magnetic MIMO
channel due to the mutual inductances between TXs and RXs. Numerical results
show that our proposed magnetic channel estimation and adaptive beamforming
schemes are practically effective, and can significantly improve the power
transfer efficiency and multi-user performance trade-off in MIMO MRC-WPT
systems.

invariable. This crossover behavior is further corroborated by the NMR

the ordering, $T_1^{-1}\sim T^{5.5}$, observed above $T^*$, is replaced by

  The JUNO simulation framework is in charge of managing event data, detector
geometries and materials, physics processes, simulation truth information etc.
It glues physics generator, detector simulation and electronics simulation
modules together to achieve a full simulation chain. In the implementation of
the framework, many attractive characteristics of the SNiPER have been used,
such as dynamic loading, flexible flow control, multiple event management and
Python binding. Furthermore, additional efforts have been made to make both
detector and electronics simulation flexible enough to accommodate and optimize
different detector designs.
  For the Geant4-based detector simulation, each sub-detector component is
implemented as a SNiPER tool which is a dynamically loadable and configurable
plugin. So it is possible to select the detector configuration at runtime. The
framework provides the event loop to drive the detector simulation and
interacts with the Geant4 which is implemented as a passive service. All levels
of user actions are wrapped into different customizable tools, so that user
functions can be easily extended by just adding new tools. The electronics
simulation has been implemented by following an event driven scheme. The SNiPER
task component is used to simulate data processing steps in the electronics
modules. The electronics and trigger are synchronized by triggered events
containing possible physics signals.

repulsive interaction, each string may acquire, before the hadronization, the
additional transverse boost, which is an efficient sum of all accounted

interaction potentials (such as the Coulomb potential) make the equations
inconsistent, except in very special cases. However, there have been recent
successes in setting up consistent multi-time equations involving interaction,
in two ways: either involving zero-range ($\delta$ potential) interaction or
involving particle creation and annihilation. The latter equations provide a
multi-time formulation of a quantum field theory. The wave function in these
equations is a multi-time Fock function, i.e., a family of functions consisting
of, for every $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, an $n$-particle wave function with $n$ time
variables. These wave functions are related to the Tomonaga-Schwinger approach
and to quantum field operators, but, as we point out, they have several
advantages.

to their participation in the shortest paths of a network. In several
scenarios, having a high betweenness can have a positive impact on the node
itself. Hence, in this paper we consider the problem of determining how much a
vertex can increase its centrality by creating a limited amount of new edges
incident to it. In particular, we study the problem of maximizing the
betweenness score of a given node -- Maximum Betweenness Improvement (MBI) --
and that of maximizing the ranking of a given node -- Maximum Ranking
Improvement (MRI). We show that MBI cannot be approximated in polynomial-time
within a factor $(1-\frac{1}{2e})$ and that MRI does not admit any
polynomial-time constant factor approximation algorithm, both unless $P=NP$. We
then propose a simple greedy approximation algorithm for MBI with an almost
tight approximation ratio and we test its performance on several real-world
networks. We experimentally show that our algorithm highly increases both the
betweenness score and the ranking of a given node ant that it outperforms
several competitive baselines. To speed up the computation of our greedy
algorithm, we also propose a new dynamic algorithm for updating the betweenness
of one node after an edge insertion, which might be of independent interest.
Using the dynamic algorithm, we are now able to compute an approximation of MBI
on networks with up to $10^5$ edges in most cases in a matter of seconds or a
few minutes.

belonging to the glycosaminoglycan family. HS proteoglycans are ubiquitously
found at the cell surface and extracellular matrix in animal species. HS is
involved in the interaction with a wide variety of proteins and the regulation
of many biological activities. In certain pathologic conditions, expression and
shedding of HS proteoglycans is overregulated, or enzymatic degradation of HS
in lysosomes is deficient, both leading to excess circulating free HS chains in
blood plasma. HS has therefore been suggested as a biomarker for various severe
disease states. The structural heterogeneity makes the quantification of
heparan sulfate in complex matrices such as human plasma challenging. HS plasma
levels are usually quantified by either disaccharide analysis or enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Both methods require time-consuming
multistep-protocols. We describe here the instant detection of heparan sulfate
in spiked plasma samples by the Heparin Red Kit, a commercial mix-and-read

sufficiently sensitive for the detection of highly elevated HS levels as
reported for mucopolysaccharidosis, graft versus host disease after

determined by minimizing the misfit with the observations. To obtain a

derivation of \emph{a representation basis consistent with the observation

then tailored to be both observable by the sensors and accurate in

eigenvalues seem always unstable. This study could be applied to coupled

decisions it would be valuable to obtain early estimates of LGG growth
potential. Here we propose a simple mathematical model of LGG growth and its
response to chemotherapy which allows the growth of LGGs to be described in
real patients. The model predicts, and our clinical data confirms, that the
speed of response to chemotherapy is related to tumour aggressiveness.
Moreover, we provide a formula for the time to radiological progression, which
can be possibly used as a measure of tumour aggressiveness. Finally, we suggest
that the response to a few chemotherapy cycles upon diagnosis might be used to
predict tumour growth and to guide therapeutical actions on the basis of the

or laptops, goes hand-in-hand with evolution of new mobile applications.
However, running computationally demanding applications at the UEs is
constrained by limited battery capacity and energy consumption of the UEs.
Suitable solution extending the battery life-time of the UEs is to offload the
applications demanding huge processing to a conventional centralized cloud
(CC). Nevertheless, this option introduces significant execution delay
consisting in delivery of the offloaded applications to the cloud and back plus
time of the computation at the cloud. Such delay is inconvenient and make the
offloading unsuitable for real-time applications. To cope with the delay
problem, a new emerging concept, known as mobile edge computing (MEC), has been
introduced. The MEC brings computation and storage resources to the edge of
mobile network enabling to run the highly demanding applications at the UE
while meeting strict delay requirements. The MEC computing resources can be
exploited also by operators and third parties for specific purposes. In this
paper, we first describe major use cases and reference scenarios where the MEC
is applicable. After that we survey existing concepts integrating MEC
functionalities to the mobile networks and discuss current advancement in
standardization of the MEC. The core of this survey is, then, focused on
user-oriented use case in the MEC, i.e., computation offloading. In this
regard, we divide the research on computation offloading to three key areas: i)
decision on computation offloading, ii) allocation of computing resource within
the MEC, and iii) mobility management. Finally, we highlight lessons learned in
area of the MEC and we discuss open research challenges yet to be addressed in

Adopting the EOS of uniform nuclear matter constructed by two of the present
authors with the cluster variational method starting from the Argonne v18 and
Urbana IX nuclear potentials, the Thomas-Fermi calculation is performed to
obtain the minimized free energy of a Wigner-Seitz cell in non-uniform nuclear
matter. As a preparation for the Thomas-Fermi calculation, the EOS of uniform
nuclear matter is modified so as to remove the effects of deuteron cluster
formation in uniform matter at low densities. Mixing of alpha particles is also
taken into account following the procedure used by Shen et al. (1998, 2011).
The critical densities with respect to the phase transition from non-uniform to
uniform phase with the present EOS are slightly higher than those with the Shen
EOS at small proton fractions. The critical temperature with respect to the
liquid-gas phase transition decreases with the proton fraction in a more
gradual manner than in the Shen EOS. Furthermore, the mass and proton numbers
of nuclides appearing in non-uniform nuclear matter with small proton fractions
are larger than those of the Shen EOS. These results are consequences of the
fact that the density derivative coefficient of the symmetry energy of our EOS
is smaller than that of the Shen EOS.

propagation of signals. A relevant medical and biological example is the
anomalous subdiffusion in spiny neuronal dendrites observed in several studies
of the last decade. Anomalous subdiffusion can be modelled in several ways
introducing some fractional component into the classical cable model. The
Chauchy problem associated to these kind of models has been investigated by
many authors, but up to our knowledge an explicit solution for the signalling
problem has not yet been published. Here we propose how this solution can be
derived applying the generalized convolution theorem (known as Efros theorem)
for Laplace transforms. The fractional cable model considered in this paper is
defined by replacing the first order time derivative with a fractional
derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ of Caputo type. The signalling problem is
solved for any input function applied to the accessible end of a semi-infinite
cable, which satisfies the requirements of the Efros theorem. The solutions
corresponding to the simple cases of impulsive and step inputs are explicitly
calculated in integral form containing Wright functions. Thanks to the
variability of the parameter $\alpha$, the corresponding solutions are expected
to adapt to the qualitative behaviour of the membrane potential observed in

space-time patterns with coexisting partially coherent and partially incoherent
domains. We focus on amplitude chimeras which exhibit incoherent behavior with
respect to the amplitude rather than the phase and are transient patterns, and
show that their lifetime can be significantly enhanced by coupling delay. To
characterize their transition to phase-lag synchronization (coherent traveling
waves) and other coherent structures, we generalize the Kuramoto order
parameter. Contrasting the results for instantaneous coupling with those for
constant coupling delay, for time-varying delay, and for distributed-delay
coupling, we demonstrate that the lifetime of amplitude chimera states and
related partially incoherent states can be controlled, i.e., deliberately
reduced or increased, depending upon the type of coupling delay.

that involve convex nonlinearities, a problem that is common in machine
learning and signal processing. Because of these nonlinearities, conventional
estimators based on empirical risk minimization generally involve solving a
non-convex optimization program. We propose anchored regression, a new approach
based on convex programming that amounts to maximizing a linear functional
(perhaps augmented by a regularizer) over a convex set. The proposed convex
program is formulated in the natural space of the problem, and avoids the
introduction of auxiliary variables, making it computationally favorable.
Working in the native space also provides great flexibility as structural
priors (e.g., sparsity) can be seamlessly incorporated.
  For our analysis, we model the equations as being drawn from a fixed set
according to a probability law. Our main results provide guarantees on the
accuracy of the estimator in terms of the number of equations we are solving,
the amount of noise present, a measure of statistical complexity of the random
equations, and the geometry of the regularizer at the true solution. We also
provide recipes for constructing the anchor vector (that determines the linear
functional to maximize) directly from the observed data.

polynomially bounded formula size is contained in the class VP_s of families
that have algebraic branching programs (ABPs) of polynomially bounded size.
Motivated by the problem of separating these classes we study the topological
closure VP_e-bar, i.e. the class of polynomials that can be approximated
arbitrarily closely by polynomials in VP_e. We describe VP_e-bar with a
strikingly simple complete polynomial (in characteristic different from 2)
whose recursive definition is similar to the Fibonacci numbers. Further
understanding this polynomial seems to be a promising route to new formula
lower bounds.
  Our methods are rooted in the study of ABPs of small constant width. In 1992
Ben-Or and Cleve showed that formula size is polynomially equivalent to width-3
ABP size. We extend their result (in characteristic different from 2) by
showing that approximate formula size is polynomially equivalent to approximate
width-2 ABP size. This is surprising because in 2011 Allender and Wang gave
explicit polynomials that cannot be computed by width-2 ABPs at all! The
details of our construction lead to the aforementioned characterization of
VP_e-bar.
  As a natural continuation of this work we prove that the class VNP can be
described as the class of families that admit a hypercube summation of
polynomially bounded dimension over a product of polynomially many affine
linear forms. This gives the first separations of algebraic complexity classes
from their nondeterministic analogs.

nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, high conversion efficiencies between
nitrogen (P1) defects and NV centers are essential, while maintaining long
coherence times of an NV ensemble. In this work, we study the effect of
electron irradiation on the conversion efficiency and the coherence time of
various types of diamond samples with different initial nitrogen

existence is determined by the fast particles, is investigated in cases where
these particles do not move freely and their motion is bounded to restricted
orbits. An equilibrium oscillating potential, which creates different orbit
topologies of energetic particles, is included into the bump-on-tail
instability problem of a plasma wave. With respect to fast particles dynamics,
the extended model captures the range of particles motion (trapped/passing)
with energy and thus represents a more realistic 1D picture of the long range
sweeping events observed for weakly damped modes, e.g. global Alfven
eigenmodes, in tokamaks. The Poisson equation is solved numerically along with
bounce averaging the Vlasov equation in the adiabatic regime. We demonstrate
that the shape and the saturation amplitude of the nonlinear mode structure
depends not only on the amount of deviation from the initial eigenfrequency but
also on the initial energy of the resonant electrons in the equilibrium
potential. Similarly, the results reveal that the resonant electrons following
different equilibrium orbits in the electrostatic potential lead to different
rates of frequency evolution. As compared to the previous model [Breizman B.N.

rates. The additional physics included in the model enables a more complete 1D

higher-twist effects and in the experimental extraction of $b_1$ from the spin

physics beyond the standard deuteron model for their interpretation. Future
$b_1$ studies could shed light on a new field of hadron physics. In particular,
detailed experimental studies of $b_1$ will start soon at the Thomas Jefferson

the cardinality of $\Omega $ should be at least equal to the largest geometric
multiplicity of eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, and we consider the universal
spatiotemporal sampling sets $(\Omega, l_i)$ for convolution operators
$\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues subject to the same largest geometric
multiplicity. We will give an algebraic characterization for such sampling sets
and show how this problem is linked with sparse signal processing theory and
polynomial interpolation theory.

in a graph so as to maximize the spread of information. It has many
applications in advertising and marketing on social networks. In this paper, we
study a highly generic version of influence maximization, one of optimizing
influence campaigns by sequentially selecting ""spread seeds"" from a set of
influencers, a small subset of the node population, under the hypothesis that,
in a given campaign, previously activated nodes remain ""persistently"" active
throughout and thus do not yield further rewards. This problem is in particular
relevant for an important form of online marketing, known as influencer
marketing, in which the marketers target a sub-population of influential
people, instead of the entire base of potential buyers. Importantly, we make no
assumptions on the underlying diffusion model and we work in a setting where
neither a diffusion network nor historical activation data are available. We
call this problem online influencer marketing with persistence (in short,
OIMP). We first discuss motivating scenarios and present our general approach.
We introduce an estimator on the influencers' remaining potential -- the
expected number of nodes that can still be reached from a given influencer --
and justify its strength to rapidly estimate the desired value, relying on real
data gathered from Twitter. We then describe a novel algorithm, GT-UCB, relying
on upper confidence bounds on the remaining potential. We show that our
approach leads to high-quality spreads on both simulated and real datasets,
even though it makes almost no assumptions on the diffusion medium.
Importantly, it is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art influence
maximization methods, making it possible to deal with large-scale online
scenarios.

some effects of users' psychology in mean-field-type games. In addition to the
traditional ""material"" payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced
in order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in
engineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff
value depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and
beliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium
payoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes
equilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic
empathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering
including resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and
forwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an
experiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The
basic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure
the empathy distribution of each participant. Android app called Empathizer is
developed to analyze systematically the data obtained from the participants.
The experimental results reveal that the dominated strategies of the classical
game theory are not dominated any more when users' psychology is involved, and
a significant level of cooperation is observed among the users who are
positively partially empathetic.

find a way of constructing resolutions. Spaltenstein solved this problem for
chain complexes of R-modules by truncating further and further to the left,
resolving the pieces, and gluing back the partial resolutions. Our aim is to
give a homotopy theoretical interpretation of this procedure, which may be
extended to a relative setting. We work in an arbitrary abelian category A and
fix a class I of ""injective objects"". We show that Spaltenstein's construction
can be captured by a pair of adjoint functors between unbounded chain complexes
and towers of non-positively graded ones. This pair of adjoint functors forms
what we call a Quillen pair and the above process of truncations, partial
resolutions, and gluing, gives a meaningful way to resolve complexes in a
relative setting up to a split error term. In order to do homotopy theory, and
in particular to construct a well behaved relative derived category D(A; I), we
need more: the split error term must vanish. This is the case when I is the
class of all injective R-modules but not in general, not even for certain
classes of injectives modules over a Noetherian ring. The key property is a
relative analogue of Roos's AB4*-n axiom for abelian categories. Various

repulsive). What is expected is that, for $K$ large, the process will stay in
the vicinity of the fixed point for a very long time before being absorbed at
the origin. To precisely describe this behavior, we prove the existence of a
quasi-stationary distribution (qsd). In fact, we establish a bound for the
total variation distance between the process conditioned to non-extinction
before time $t$ and the qsd. This bound is exponentially small in $t$, for
$t\gg \log K$. As a by-product, we obtain an estimate for the mean time to
extinction in the qsd. We also quantify how close is the law of the process
(not conditioned to non-extinction) either to the Dirac measure at the origin
or to the qsd, for times much larger than $\log K$ and much smaller than the
mean time to extinction, which is exponentially large as a function of $K$. Let
us stress that we are interested in what happens for finite $K$. We obtain
results much beyond what large deviation techniques could provide.

Thus each player's payoff depends on the other players' decisions and on the
decision of a virtual player (nature) who selects an adversarial distribution
of scenarios. This paper provides three main contributions. Firstly, the
distributionally robust game is formulated using the statistical notions of
$f$-divergence between two distributions, here represented by the adversarial
distribution, and the exact distribution. Secondly, the complexity of the
problem is significantly reduced by means of triality theory. Thirdly,
stochastic Bregman learning algorithms are proposed to speedup the computation
of robust equilibria. Finally, the theoretical findings are illustrated in a
convex setting and its limitations are tested with a non-convex non-concave

interpreted as being excited by the rotation of the white dwarf in an
intermediate polar system. This interpretation faces the challenge of an
apparent multi-frequency nature of this signal in the light curves taken days
180 and 196 after outburst. We show that the multi-sine fit method, based on a
superposition of two sine functions, yields two inherently indistinguishable
solutions, i.e. the presence of two close frequencies, or a single signal with
constant frequency but variable modulation amplitude. Using a power spectrum
time map, we show that on day 180, a reduction of the modulation amplitude of
the signal coincides with a substantial overall flux decline while on day 196,
the signal was only present during the first half of the observation. Supported
by simulations, we show that such variations in amplitude can lead to false
beating that manifests itself as a multiple signal if computing a periodogram
over the full light curve. Therefore, the previously proposed double frequency
nature of both light curves was probably an artefact while we consider a single
signal with frequency equal to the white dwarf rotation as more plausible.

are active in a subset of situations, thus being candidates for biomarkers.
However, the authors of those biclustering techniques that are popular in gene

of this paper is to fill this gap by combining a survey of Wikipedia readers
with a log-based analysis of user activity. Based on an initial series of user
surveys, we build a taxonomy of Wikipedia use cases along several dimensions,
capturing users' motivations to visit Wikipedia, the depth of knowledge they
are seeking, and their knowledge of the topic of interest prior to visiting
Wikipedia. Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a
large-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000

responses to the respondents' digital traces in Wikipedia's server logs,
enabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use
cases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across
topics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using
Wikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on

this context, a natural candidate for Cold Dark Matter is the gravitino. On the
other hand, assuming the supersymmetry broken at scales much higher than the
electroweak scale, gravitinos are super heavy particles. In this case, they may
be non-thermally produced during inflation, in turn originated by the scalaron
field with Starobinsky's potential.Assuming gravitinos as Lightest
supersymmetric particles (LSSP), the non-thermal production naturally accounts
for the right amount of cold dark matter. Metastability of the gravitino LSSP
leads to observable effects of their decay, putting constraints on the
corresponding Unstable or Decaying Dark Matters scenarios. In this model, the
gravitino mass is controlled by the inflaton field and it runs with it. This
implies that a continuous spectrum of superheavy gravitinos is produced during
the slow-roll epoch. Implications in phenomenology, model building in GUT
scenarios, intersecting D-branes models and instantons in string theories are
discussed.

the free-space superradiant behavior, a phenomenon which we call hyperradiance.
The effect is accompanied by strong quantum fluctuations and surprisingly
arises for atoms radiating out-of-phase, an alleged non-ideal condition, where
one expects subradiance. We are able to explain the onset of hyperradiance in a
transparent way by a photon cascade taking place among manifolds of Dicke
states with different photon numbers under particular out-of-phase coupling
conditions. The theoretical results can be realized with current technology and
thus should stimulate future experiments.

We employ terminal constraint sets which are required to be controlled

easier to compute and can be of lower complexity than ""true"" contractive ones,
lowering the required computational effort both off-line and on-line. Under
certain assumptions on the tube parameterization, recursive feasibility of the
scheme is proven. Subsequently, asymptotic stability of the origin is
guaranteed through the construction of a suitable terminal cost based on a
novel Lyapunov-like metric for compact convex sets containing the origin. A
periodic variant on the well-known homothetic tube parameterization that
satisfies the necessary assumptions and yields a tractable LPV MPC algorithm is
derived. The resulting MPC algorithm requires the on-line solution of a single
linear program with linear complexity in the prediction horizon. The properties
of the approach are demonstrated by a numerical example.

experimental and computational neuroscience. Time-scale independent and
parameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and
SPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time-scale parametric measures, since
by adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time-scales
of a given dataset.
  New Method: In data containing multiple time-scales (e.g. regular spiking and
bursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time-scales and a more
adaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the
A-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original
measures by considering the local relative to the global time-scales. For the
A-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the
RIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing.
  Results: The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance
allow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more
global scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an
unreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally,
the RIA-SPIKE-distance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike
trains.
  Comparison with Existing Methods: We find that compared to the original
versions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for
spike trains containing different time-scales without exhibiting any unwanted
side effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more
efficiently than SPIKE-Synchronization.
  Conclusions: With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now
provide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to rate only
(A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same
time (A-SPIKE-distance).

\emph{Edge-Uniform Stochastically-Evolving Graphs}. In this model, each
possible edge of an underlying general static graph evolves independently being
either alive or dead at each discrete time step of evolution following a
(Markovian) stochastic rule. The stochastic rule is identical for each possible
edge and may depend on the past $k \ge 0$ observations of the edge's state. We
examine two kinds of random walks for a single agent taking place in such a
dynamic graph: (i) The \emph{Random Walk with a Delay} (\emph{RWD}), where at
each step the agent chooses (uniformly at random) an incident possible edge,
i.e., an incident edge in the underlying static graph, and then it waits till
the edge becomes alive to traverse it. (ii) The more natural \emph{Random Walk
on what is Available} (\emph{RWA}) where the agent only looks at alive incident
edges at each time step and traverses one of them uniformly at random. Our
study is on bounding the \emph{cover time}, i.e., the expected time until each
node is visited at least once by the agent. For \emph{RWD}, we provide a first
upper bound for the cases $k = 0, 1$ by correlating \emph{RWD} with a simple
random walk on a static graph. Moreover, we present a modified electrical
network theory capturing the $k = 0$ case. For \emph{RWA}, we derive some first
bounds for the case $k = 0$, by reducing \emph{RWA} to an \emph{RWD}-equivalent
walk with a modified delay. Further, we also provide a framework, which is
shown to compute the exact value of the cover time for a general family of
stochastically-evolving graphs in exponential time. Finally, we conduct
experiments on the cover time of \emph{RWA} in Edge-Uniform graphs and compare
the experimental findings with our theoretical bounds.

In fact, this poses perhaps as the biggest challenge in the modern cosmology.
The two components of the dark sector (dark matter and dark energy) correspond
today to around ninety five percent of the universe. The simplest dark energy
candidate is a cosmological constant. However, this attempt presents a huge
discrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude between the theoretical prediction and
the observed data. Such a huge disparity motivates physicists to look into a
more sophisticated models. This can be done either looking for a deeper
understanding of where the cosmological constant comes from, if one wants to
derive it from first principles, or considering other possibilities for
accelerated expansion, such as modifications of general relativity, additional
matter fields and so on. Still regarding a dynamical dark energy, there may
exist a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, since
their densities are comparable and, depending on the coupling used, the
interaction can also alleviate the issue of why dark energy and matter
densities are of the same order today. Phenomenological models have been widely
explored in the literature. On the other hand, field theory models that aim a
consistent description of the dark energy/dark matter interaction are still
few. In this thesis, we explore either a scalar or a vector field as a dark
energy candidate in several different approaches, taking into account a

framework for underactuated flying humanoid robots. These robots may thus have
the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation, and benefit
from technologies and methods developed for Whole-Body Control and Aerial
Manipulation. As in the case of quadrotors, we as- sume that the humanoid robot
is powered by four thrust forces. For convenience, these forces are placed at
the robot hands and feet. The control objective is defined as the asymptotic
stabilization of the robot centroidal momentum. This objective allows us to
track a desired trajectory for the robot center of mass and keep small errors
between a reference orientation and the robot base frame. Stability and
convergence of the robot momentum are shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov.
Simulations carried out on a model of the humanoid robot iCub verify the
soundness of the proposed approach.

modelling $N$ populations in interaction, all structured by different traits.
Interactions are modelled by non-local terms involving linear combinations of
the total number of individuals in each population. These models have already
been shown to be suitable for the modelling of drug resistance in cancer, and
they generalise the usual Lotka-Volterra ordinary differential equations. Our
aim is to give conditions under which there is persistence of all species.
Through the analysis of a Lyapunov function, our first main result gives a
simple and general condition on the matrix of interactions, together with a
convergence rate. The second main result establishes another type of condition
in the specific case of mutualistic interactions. When either of these
conditions is met, we describe which traits are asymptotically selected.

the resultant dynamic behaviour is so complex that, in communication theory,

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1505.00555",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an optical parallel computation similar to quantum computation
that can be realized by introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into classical
optical fields with two orthogonal modes. Based on the pseudorandom phase
sequences, we first propose a theoretical framework of ""phase ensemble model""
referring from the concept of quantum ensemble. Using the ensemble model, we
further demonstrate the inseparability of the fields similar to quantum
entanglement. It is interesting that a N2^N dimensional Hilbert space spanned
by N optical fields is larger than that spanned by N quantum particles. This
leads a problem for our scheme that is not the lack of resources but the
redundancy of resources. In order to reduce the redundancy, we propose a
special sequence permutation mechanism to efficiently imitate certain quantum
states, including the product state, Bell states, GHZ state and W state. For
better fault tolerance, we further devise each orthogonal mode of optical
fields is measured to assign discrete values. Finally, we propose a generalized
gate array model to imitate some quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm,
Grover's algorithm and quantum Fourier algorithm. The research on the optical
parallel computation might be important, for it not only has the potential
beyond quantum computation, but also provides useful insights into fundamental
concepts of quantum mechanics.

substrates were obtained by e-beam vapor deposition. The VOx films were then
annealed at temperatures between 300 to 500 C with various deposition duration

significantly influenced by various climatic factors and large-scale
atmospheric circulation patterns. Efficient water resources management requires
an understanding of the effects of climate indices on the accurate
predictability of precipitation. This study aims at understanding the
standalone teleconnection between precipitation across India and the four
climate indices, namely, Ni\~no 3.4, PDO, SOI, and IOD using partial wavelet
analysis. The analysis considers the cross correlation between the climate
indices while estimating the relationship with precipitation. Previous studies
have overlooked the interdependence between these climate indices while
analysing their effect on precipitation. The results of the study reveal that
precipitation is only affected by Ni\~no 3.4 and IOD and a non-stationary
relationship exists between precipitation and these two climate indices.
Further, partial wavelet analysis revealed that SOI and PDO do not
significantly affect precipitation, but seems the other way because of their
interdependence on Ni\~no 3.4. It was observed that partial wavelet analysis
strongly revealed the standalone relationship of climatic factors with
precipitation after eliminating other potential factors. Keywords: Indian

with spatially varying surface charge is considered in the limit of small
electrical potentials for arbitrary Debye lengths. A simple expression for the
disjoining pressure is derived in terms of a two dimensional integral in
Fourier space. The integral is evaluated for periodic and random charge
distributions and the disjoining pressure is expressed as a sum over
Fourier-Bloch reciprocal lattice vectors or in terms of an integral involving
the autocorrelation function respectively. The force between planes with a
finite area of uniform charge, a model for the DLVO interaction between finite
surfaces, is also calculated. It is shown that the overspill of the charge
cloud beyond the region immediately between the charged areas results in a
reduction of the disjoining pressure, as reported by us recently in the long
Debye length limit for planes of finite width.

subset of a collection of available sensors to reduce the sensing cost while
preserving signal acquisition performance. The majority of sensor selection
algorithms find the subset of sensors that best recovers an arbitrary signal
from a number of linear measurements that is larger than the dimension of the

(or near sparse) signals that finds a subset of sensors that best recovers such
signals from a number of measurements that is much smaller than the dimension
of the signal. Existing sensor selection algorithms cannot be applied in such
situations. Our proposed Incoherent Sensor Selection (Insense) algorithm
minimizes a coherence-based cost function that is adapted from recent results
in sparse recovery theory. Using six datasets, including two real-world
datasets on microbial diagnostics and structural health monitoring, we
demonstrate the superior performance of Insense for sparse-signal sensor
