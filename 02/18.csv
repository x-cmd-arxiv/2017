of biomedical images. With ever-growing sizes and amounts of three-dimensional
images to be processed, there is a need for better and faster segmentation
methods. Graph-based image segmentation has seen a rise in popularity in recent
years, but is seen as very costly with regard to computational demand. We
propose a new segmentation algorithm which overcomes these limitations. Our
method uses recursive balanced graph partitioning to segment foreground
components of a fast and efficient binarization. We construct a model for the
cell nuclei to guide the partitioning process. Our algorithm is compared to
other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms in an experimental evaluation on
two sets of realistically simulated inputs. Our method is faster, has similar
or better quality and an acceptable memory overhead.

microscopic origin of the vanishingly low magnetic anisotropy of Permalloy,

It is shown that the local magnetic anisotropy of individual atoms in Permalloy
can be several orders of magnitude larger than that of the bulk sample, and
5-10 times larger than that of elemental Fe or Ni. We, furthermore, show that
locally there are several easy axis directions that are favored, depending on
local composition. The results are discussed in the context of perturbation
theory, applying the relation between magnetic anisotropy and orbital moment.
Permalloy keeps its strong ferromagnetic nature due to the exchange energy to
be larger than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Our results shine light on
the magnetic anisotropy of permalloy and of magnetic materials in general, and
in addition enhance the understanding of pump-probe measurements and ultrafast
magnetization dynamics.

complexity because every time only one or a few block variables would need to
be updated among possibly a large number of blocks. They are also easily
parallelized and thus have been particularly popular for solving problems
involving large-scale dataset and/or variables. In this paper, we propose a
primal-dual BCU method for solving linearly constrained convex program in
multi-block variables. The method is an accelerated version of a primal-dual
algorithm proposed by the authors, which applies randomization in selecting
block variables to update and establishes an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate under
weak convexity assumption. We show that the rate can be accelerated to
$O(1/t^2)$ if the objective is strongly convex. In addition, if one block
variable is independent of the others in the objective, we then show that the
algorithm can be modified to achieve a linear rate of convergence. The
numerical experiments show that the accelerated method performs stably with a
single set of parameters while the original method needs to tune the parameters
for different datasets in order to achieve a comparable level of performance.

network research. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of different
sampling techniques (node sampling, edge sampling, random walk sampling, and
snowball sampling) on social networks with attributes. We consider the special
case of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male
and female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is
unequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes
with the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e.,
homophilic or heterophilic behavior). We evaluate the different sampling
techniques with respect to conserving the position of nodes and the visibility
of groups in such networks. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic and
empirical social networks. Our results provide evidence that different network
sampling techniques are highly sensitive with regard to capturing the expected
centrality of nodes, and that their accuracy depends on relative group size
differences and on the level of homophily that can be observed in the network.
We conclude that uninformed sampling from social networks with attributes thus
can significantly impair the ability of researchers to draw valid conclusions
about the centrality of nodes and the visibility or invisibility of groups in
social networks.

spatial resolution reveal new layers of complexity of atmospheric processes on
a variety of scales. Aim: To analyze the physical mechanisms that cause
asymmetries and surface structures in observed images, we use detailed 3D
dynamical simulations of AGB stars; these simulations self-consistently
describe convection and pulsations. Methods: We used the CO5BOLD
radiation-hydrodynamics code to produce an exploratory grid of global
""star-in-a-box"" models of the outer convective envelope and the inner
atmosphere of AGB stars to study convection, pulsations, and shock waves and
their dependence on stellar and numerical parameters. Results: The model
dynamics are governed by the interaction of long-lasting giant convection
cells, short-lived surface granules, and strong, radial, fundamental-mode
pulsations. Radial pulsations and shorter wavelength, traveling, acoustic waves
induce shocks on various scales in the atmosphere. Convection, waves, and
shocks all contribute to the dynamical pressure and, thus, to an increase of
the stellar radius and to a levitation of material into layers where dust can
form. Consequently, the resulting relation of pulsation period and stellar
radius is shifted toward larger radii compared to that of non-linear 1D models.
The dependence of pulsation period on luminosity agrees well with observed
relations. The interaction of the pulsation mode with the non-stationary
convective flow causes occasional amplitude changes and phase shifts. The
regularity of the pulsations decreases with decreasing gravity as the relative
size of convection cells increases. The model stars do not have a well-defined
surface. Instead, the light is emitted from a very extended inhomogeneous
atmosphere with a complex dynamic pattern of high-contrast features.

  We address the problem of increasing diversity in recommendation systems that

formulate recommendation system design as a subgraph selection problem from a
candidate super-graph of potential recommendations where both diversity and
rating quality are explicitly optimized: (1) On the modeling side, we define a
new flexible notion of diversity that allows a system designer to prescribe the
number of recommendations each item should receive, and smoothly penalizes
deviations from this distribution. (2) On the algorithmic side, we show that
minimum-cost network flow methods yield fast algorithms in theory and practice
for designing recommendation subgraphs that optimize this notion of diversity.

contents to a group of receivers over a packet erasure broadcast channel (BC).
The receivers are divided into two sets with regards to their channel
qualities: the weak and strong receivers, where all the weak receivers have
statistically worse channel qualities than all the strong receivers. The weak
receivers, in order to compensate for the high erasure probability they
encounter over the channel, are equipped with cache memories of equal size,
while the receivers in the strong set have no caches. Data can be pre-delivered
to weak receivers' caches over the off-peak traffic period before the receivers
reveal their demands. Allowing arbitrary erasure probabilities for the weak and
strong receivers, a joint caching and channel coding scheme, which divides each
file into several subfiles, and applies a different caching and delivery scheme
for each subfile, is proposed. It is shown that all the receivers, even those
without any cache memories, benefit from the presence of caches across the

upon the state-of-the-art in terms of the achievable trade-off.

maximal matching, and vertex colouring) in the LOCAL model of computation are
very well-understood in cycles (toroidal 1-dimensional grids): every problem
has a complexity of $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log^* n)$, or $\Theta(n)$, and the design
of optimal algorithms can be fully automated.
  This work develops the complexity theory of LCL problems for toroidal
2-dimensional grids. The complexity classes are the same as in the
1-dimensional case: $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log^* n)$, and $\Theta(n)$. However, given
an LCL problem it is undecidable whether its complexity is $\Theta(\log^* n)$
or $\Theta(n)$ in 2-dimensional grids.
  Nevertheless, if we correctly guess that the complexity of a problem is
$\Theta(\log^* n)$, we can completely automate the design of optimal
algorithms. For any problem we can find an algorithm that is of a normal form
$A' \circ S_k$, where $A'$ is a finite function, $S_k$ is an algorithm for
finding a maximal independent set in $k$th power of the grid, and $k$ is a
constant.
  Finally, partially with the help of automated design tools, we classify the

high resolution (0.06 x 0.05) ALMA 690 GHz observations we have found bright
(TB >80 K) and compact (FWHM 10x7 pc) CO 6-5 line emission in the nucleus of
the extremely radio-quiet galaxy NGC1377. The integrated CO 6-5 intensity is
aligned with the previously discovered jet/outflow of NGC1377 and is tracing
the dense (n>1e4 cm-3), hot gas at the base of the outflow. The velocity
structure is complex and shifts across the jet/outflow are discussed in terms
of jet-rotation or separate, overlapping kinematical components. High velocity
gas (deltaV +-145 km/s) is detected inside r<2-3 pc and we suggest that it is
emerging from an inclined rotating disk or torus of position angle PA=140+-20
deg with a dynamical mass of approx 3e6 Msun. This mass is consistent with that
of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), as inferred from the M-sigma relation. The
gas mass of the proposed disk/torus constitutes <3% of the nuclear dynamical
mass. In contrast to the intense CO 6-5 line emission, we do not detect dust
continuum with an upper limit of S(690GHz)<2mJy. The corresponding, 5 pc, H2
column density is estimated to N(H2)<3e23 cm-2, which is inconsistent with a
Compton Thick (CT) source. We discuss the possibility that CT obscuration may
be occuring on small (subparsec) or larger scales. From SED fitting we suggest
that half of the IR emission of NGC1377 is nuclear and the rest (mostly the
far-infrared (FIR)) is more extended. The extreme radio quietness, and the lack
of emission from other star formation tracers, raise questions on the origin of
the FIR emission. We discuss the possibility that it is arising from the
dissipation of shocks in the molecular jet/outflow or from irradiation by the
nuclear source along the poles.

an alternative method which modifies orthogonal recursive bisection to solve
the cell-partition misalignment that has kept it from scaling previously.
Secondly, we optimize the granularity of communication to find the optimal
balance between a bulk-synchronous collective communication of the local
essential tree and an RDMA per task per cell. Finally, we take the dynamic
sparse data exchange proposed by Hoefler et al. and extend it to a hierarchical

can improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias:
several adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation have recently
been introduced, which reduce the difference between the training and test
domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. Prior
generative approaches show compelling visualizations, but are not optimal on
discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. Prior discriminative
approaches could handle larger domain shifts, but imposed tied weights on the

generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent
state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and we use this generalized view
to better relate the prior approaches. We propose a previously unexplored
instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling,
untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative
Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably
simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise

hypothetical binaries are expected to be long, we cannot hope to observe many
orbital cycles during our lifetimes. Instead, we seek to evaluate the
credentials of the SBHB candidates by attempting to rule out the SBHB

the period, and thus the mass, of the SBHBs under the assumption that the

areas of science. Widely used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) addresses this
problem by computing a low dimensional data embedding that maximally explain
variance of the data. However, PCA has two major weaknesses. Firstly, it only
considers linear correlations among variables (features), and secondly it is
not suitable for categorical data. We resolve these issues by proposing
Maximally Correlated Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA). MCPCA computes
transformations of variables whose covariance matrix has the largest Ky Fan
norm. Variable transformations are unknown, can be nonlinear and are computed
in an optimization. MCPCA can also be viewed as a multivariate extension of
Maximal Correlation. For jointly Gaussian variables we show that the covariance
matrix corresponding to the identity (or the negative of the identity)
transformations majorizes covariance matrices of non-identity functions. Using
this result we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for nonlinear functions of
jointly Gaussian variables for every rank constraint. For categorical variables
we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for the rank one constraint based on
the leading eigenvector of a matrix computed using pairwise joint
distributions. For a general rank constraint we propose a block coordinate
descend algorithm and show its convergence to stationary points of the MCPCA
optimization. We compare MCPCA with PCA and other state-of-the-art

several novel features of this model, which can be relevant even when the $C$
particle constitutes only a small fraction of the number density (and energy
density). We assume a small asymmetric abundance of the $C$ particle whose
charge is compensated by a heavy $X$ particle so that the relic abundance of
dark matter consists mostly of symmetric $X$ and $\bar{X}$, with a small
asymmetric component made up of $X$ and $C$. As the universe cools, it
undergoes asymmetric recombination binding the free $C$s into $(XC)$ dark atoms
efficiently. Even with a tiny asymmetric component, the presence of $C$
particles catalyzes tight coupling between the heavy dark matter $X$ and the
dark photon plasma that can lead to a significant suppression of the matter
power spectrum on small scales and lead to some of the strongest bounds on such

multiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust
clouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid. In addition, the system
contains circumstellar gas, evident by broad absorption lines, mostly in the
u'-band, and a dust disc, indicated by an infrared excess. Here we present the
first detection of a change in colour of WD1145+017 during transits, using
simultaneous multi-band fast-photometry ULTRACAM measurements over the
u'g'r'i'-bands. The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during
transits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour
difference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for
the bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in
the spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric
data, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of
reduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits. This
indicates that the transiting objects and the gas share the same line-of-sight,
and that the gas covers the white dwarf only partially, as would be expected if
the gas, the transiting debris, and the dust emitting the infrared excess, are
part of the same general disc structure (although possibly at different radii).

which the star formation is less extreme; this suggests the form of the IMF
should exhibit a radial trend in ETGs. Here we report radial stellar population
gradients out to the half-light radii of a sample of eight nearby ETGs.
Spatially resolved spectroscopy at 0.8-1.35{\mu}m from the VLT's KMOS
instrument was used to measure radial trends in the strengths of a variety of
IMF-sensitive absorption features (including some which are previously
unexplored). We find weak or no radial variation in some of these which, given
a radial IMF trend, ought to vary measurably, e.g. for the Wing-Ford band we
measure a gradient of +0.06$\pm$0.04 per decade in radius.
  Using stellar population models to fit stacked and individual spectra, we
infer that the measured radial changes in absorption feature strengths are
primarily accounted for by abundance gradients which are fairly consistent
across our sample (e.g. we derive an average [Na/H] gradient of
-0.53$\pm$0.07). The inferred contribution of dwarf stars to the total light

astrophysical plasmas is the anisotropic transport of heat along magnetic field
lines from higher to lower temperatures.Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) typically
involves solving the hyperbolic set of conservation equations along with the
induction equation. Incorporating anisotropic thermal conduction requires to
also treat parabolic terms arising from the diffusion operator. An explicit
treatment of parabolic terms will considerably reduce the simulation time step
due to its dependence on the square of the grid resolution ($\Delta x$) for
stability. Although an implicit scheme relaxes the constraint on stability, it
is difficult to distribute efficiently on a parallel architecture. Treating
parabolic terms with accelerated super-time stepping (STS) methods has been
discussed in literature but these methods suffer from poor accuracy (first
order in time) and also have difficult-to-choose tuneable stability parameters.
In this work we highlight a second order (in time) Runge Kutta Legendre (RKL)
scheme (first described by Meyer et. al. 2012) that is robust, fast and
accurate in treating parabolic terms alongside the hyperbolic conversation
laws. We demonstrate its superiority over the first order super time stepping
schemes with standard tests and astrophysical applications. We also show that
explicit conduction is particularly robust in handling saturated thermal
conduction. Parallel scaling of explicit conduction using RKL scheme is
demonstrated up to more than $10^4$ processors.

the flaring ratio, duty cycle, and the modulation index in the ""off""-state, in

more variable and have relatively larger outbursts than the FSRQs, (2)
unclassified blazar candidates in our sample show similar variability
characteristics as the FSRQs, and (3) $\gamma$-ray detected differ from the
$\gamma$-ray non-detected sources in all their variability properties,
suggesting a link between the production of $\gamma$-rays and the mechanism

around $+$20 days, when the photospheric emission shifted from an outer layer,
dominated by natal C and O, to a more aspherical inner core, dominated by
freshly nucleosynthesized material. This two-layered model might account for

behavioral or financial incentives to a large number of agents. Two challenges
faced by the coordinator are a finite budget from which to allocate incentives,
and an initial lack of knowledge about the utility function of the agents.
Here, we present a behavioral analytics approach to solve the coordinator's
problem when agents make decisions by maximizing utility functions that depend
on prior system states, inputs, and other parameters that are initially unknown
and subject to temporal dynamics. Our behavioral analytics framework involves
three steps: first, we develop a behavioral model that describes the
decision-making process of an agent; second, we use data to estimate behavioral
model parameters for each agent and then use these estimates to predict future
decisions of each agent; and third, we use the estimated behavioral model
parameters to optimize a set of costly incentives to provide to each agent. In
this paper, we describe a specific set of tools, models, and approaches that
fit into this framework, and that adapt models and incentives as new
information is collected by repeating the second and third steps of this
framework. Furthermore, we prove that incentives computed by this adaptive
approach are asymptotically optimal with respect to a given loss function that
describes the coordinator's objective. We optimize incentives using a
decomposition scheme, where each sub-problem solves the coordinator's problem
for a single agent, and the master problem is a pure integer program. We
conclude with a simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our
behavioral analytics approach in designing personalized treatment plans for a
weight loss program. The results show our approach maintains efficacy of the
program while reducing costs by up to 60%, while adaptive heuristics provide
less savings.

generating function of DT invariants in the large volume attractor chamber must
be a vector-valued mock modular form with specified modular properties. In this
work, we prove that this condition is also sufficient at two-instanton order.
This is achieved by producing a holomorphic action of SL(2,Z) on the twistor
space which preserves the holomorphic contact structure. The key step is to
cancel the anomalous modular variation of the Darboux coordinates by a local
holomorphic contact transformation, which is generated by a suitable indefinite
theta series. For this purpose we introduce a new family of theta series of

interfere with each other in multiport interferometers, or carry entanglement
between distant nodes for use in entanglement swapping. This requires the
photons be spectrally pure to ensure good interference, and have high heralding
efficiency to know accurately the number of photons involved and to maintain
high rates as the number of photons grows. Spectral filtering is often used to
remove noise and define spectral properties. For heralded single photons high
purity and heralding efficiency is possible by filtering the heralding arm, but
when both photons in typical pair sources are filtered, we show that the
heralding efficiency of one or both of the photons is strongly reduced even by
ideal spectral filters with 100% transmission in the passband: any improvement
in reduced-state spectral purity from filtering comes at the cost of lowered
heralding efficiency. We consider the fidelity to a pure, lossless single
photon, symmetrize it to include both photons of the pair, and show this
quantity is intrinsically limited for sources with spectral correlation. We
then provide a framework for this effect for benchmarking common photon pair
sources, and present an experiment where we vary the photon filter bandwidths

efficiency.

harmonic measure, notoriously missing for sets of higher co-dimension. The aim
of this manuscript is to develop a version of elliptic theory, associated to a
linear PDE, which ultimately yields a notion analogous to that of the harmonic
measure, for sets of codimension higher than 1.
  To this end, we turn to degenerate elliptic equations. Let $\Gamma \subset
\mathbb R^n$ be an Ahlfors regular set of dimension $d<n-1$ (not necessarily
integer) and $\Omega = \mathbb R^n \setminus \Gamma$. Let $L = - {\rm div}
A\nabla$ be a degenerate elliptic operator with measurable coefficients such
that the ellipticity constants of the matrix $A$ are bounded from above and
below by a multiple of ${\rm dist}(\cdot, \Gamma)^{d+1-n}$. We define weak
solutions; prove trace and extension theorems in suitable weighted Sobolev
spaces; establish the maximum principle, De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates, the
Harnack inequality, the H\""older continuity of solutions (inside and at the
boundary). We define the Green function and provide the basic set of pointwise
and/or $L^p$ estimates for the Green function and for its gradient. With this
at hand, we define harmonic measure associated to $L$, establish its doubling
property, non-degeneracy, change-of-the-pole formulas, and, finally, the
comparison principle for local solutions.
  In another article to appear, we will prove that when $\Gamma$ is the graph
of a Lipschitz function with small Lipschitz constant, we can find an elliptic
operator $L$ for which the harmonic measure given here is absolutely continuous

hundreds and thousands of times is mysterious. The most popular models for the
ULXs involve either intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or stellar-mass black
holes accreting at super-Eddington rates. Here we review the ULX properties.
Their X-ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks
supposing the supercritical accretion. In recent years, new surprising results
were discovered in X-ray data, ULX-pulsars and high-velocity outflows up to 0.2
c. They are also in accordance with the super-Eddington accretion. However, the
strongest evidences come from optical spectroscopy. The spectra of the ULX
counterparts are very similar to that of SS433, the only known supercritical
accretor in our Galaxy. The spectra are apparently of WNL type (late nitrogen
Wolf-Rayet stars) or LBV (luminous blue variables) in their hot state, which
are very scarce stellar objects. We find that the spectra do not originate from
WNL/LBV type donors but from very hot winds from the accretion disks, which
have similar physical conditions as the stellar winds from these stars. The
results suggest that bona-fide ULXs must constitute a homogeneous class of
objects, which most likely have supercritical accretion disks.

large areal datasets due to their ease of interpretation and computational
convenience afforded by the sparse precision matrices needed for random
variable generation. Typically in Bayesian computation, GMRFs are updated
jointly in a block Gibbs sampler or componentwise in a single-site sampler via
the full conditional distributions. The former approach can speed convergence
by updating correlated variables all at once, while the latter avoids solving
large matrices. We consider a sampling approach in which the underlying graph
can be cut so that conditionally independent sites are updated simultaneously.
This algorithm allows a practitioner to parallelize updates of subsets of
locations or to take advantage of `vectorized' calculations in a high-level
language such as R. Through both simulated and real data, we demonstrate
computational savings that can be achieved versus both single-site and block
updating, regardless of whether the data are on a regular or an irregular
lattice. The approach provides a good compromise between statistical and
computational efficiency and is accessible to statisticians without expertise

recurring U-shaped features across the cm-wave and mm-wave bands. The symmetry
of these features points to lensing by an intervening object as the cause.
U-shaped events in radio light curves in the cm-wave band have previously been
attributed to Extreme scattering events (ESE). ESEs are thought to be the
result of lensing by compact plasma structures in the Galactic interstellar
medium, but the precise nature of these plasma structures remains unknown.
Since the strength of a plasma lens evolves with wavelength $\lambda$ as
$\lambda^2$, the presence of correlated variations at over a wide wavelength
range casts doubt on the canonical ESE interpretation for J1415+1320. In this
paper, we critically examine the evidence for plasma lensing in J1415+1320. We
compute limits on the lensing strength, and the associated free-free opacity of
the putative plasma lenses. We compare the observed and model ESE light curves,
and also derive a lower limit on the lens distance based on the effects of
parallax due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. We conclude that plasma
lensing is not a viable interpretation for J1415+1320's light curves and that
symmetric U-shaped features in the radio light curves of extragalactic sources
do not present {\em prima facie} evidence for ESEs. The methodology presented
here is generic enough to be applicable to any plasma lensing candidate.

form play an important role in modern SAT solving. Before or during the actual
solving process, such procedures identify and remove clauses that are
irrelevant to the solving result. These simplifications usually rely on
so-called redundancy properties that characterize cases in which the removal of
a clause does not affect the satisfiability status of a formula. One
particularly successful redundancy property is that of blocked clauses, because
it generalizes several other redundancy properties. To find out whether a
clause is blocked---and therefore redundant---one only needs to consider its
resolution environment, i.e., the clauses with which it can be resolved. For
this reason, we say that the redundancy property of blocked clauses is local.
In this paper, we show that there exist local redundancy properties that are
even more general than blocked clauses. We present a semantic notion of
blocking and prove that it constitutes the most general local redundancy
property. We furthermore introduce the syntax-based notions of set-blocking and
super-blocking, and show that the latter coincides with our semantic blocking
notion. In addition, we show how semantic blocking can be alternatively
characterized via Davis and Putnam's rule for eliminating atomic formulas.
Finally, we perform a detailed complexity analysis and relate our novel
redundancy properties to prominent redundancy properties from the literature.

show that a large DoF gain can be achieved by exploiting the benefits of having
a shared relay that cooperates with the BSs. We first propose a cache-assisted

inquiry into regret bounds for FTPL algorithms beyond the bounded hazard rate

throughput, and delay in making their offloading decisions: while they may save
money and receive a higher throughput by waiting for WiFi access, they may not
wait for WiFi if they are sensitive to delay. To navigate this tradeoff, we
develop AMUSE (Adaptive bandwidth Management through USer-Empowerment), a
functional prototype of a practical, cost-aware WiFi offloading system that
takes into account a user's throughput-delay tradeoffs and cellular budget
constraint. Based on predicted future usage and WiFi availability, AMUSE
decides which applications to offload to what times of the day. Since nearly
all traffic flows from mobile devices are TCP flows, we introduce a new
receiver-side bandwidth allocation mechanism to practically enforce the
assigned rate of each TCP application. Thus, AMUSE users can optimize their
bandwidth rates according to their own cost-throughput-delay tradeoff without
relying on support from different apps' content servers. Through a measurement
study of 20 smartphone users' traffic usage traces, we observe that though
users already offload a large amount of some application types, our framework
can offload a significant additional portion of users' cellular traffic. We
implement AMUSE and evaluate its effectiveness with 3G and WiFi usage data

including testing for pairwise interaction among large numbers of neurons. With
advances in technologies, it has become common to record from hundreds of
neurons simultaneously, and this number is growing quickly, so that the number
of pairwise tests can be very large. It is important to control the rate at
which false positives occur. In addition, there is sometimes information that
affects the probability of a positive result for any given pair. In the case of
neurons, they are more likely to have correlated activity when they are close
together, and when they respond similarly to various stimuli. Recently a method
was developed to control false positives when covariate information, such as
distances between pairs of neurons, is available. This method, however, relies
on computationally-intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Here we develop
an alternative, based on Sequential Monte Carlo, which scales well with the
size of the dataset. This scheme considers data items sequentially, with
relevant probabilities being updated at each step. Simulation experiments

through years of practice; however existing approaches to model this trait for
diverse tasks including monitoring pedestrian flow and detecting abnormal

research in the area of deep-learning has demonstrated the power of learning
features directly from the data; and related research in recurrent neural
networks has shown exemplary results in sequence-to-sequence problems such as
neural machine translation and neural image caption generation. Motivated by
these approaches, we propose a novel method to predict the future motion of a

which utilises both ""soft attention"" as well as ""hard-wired"" attention in order

soft attention weights in order to make our model applicable for challenging
real world scenarios with hundreds of neighbours. The navigational capability
of the proposed method is tested on two challenging publicly available

diffusion in the neuronal transmission occurringin the Purkinje cells, whose
malfunctioning is known to be related to the lack of voluntary coordination and
the appearance of tremors. Also, a classical mathematical feature is that
(fractional) parabolic equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with
the case of hyperbolic equations, which typically exhibit shocks and
discontinuities. In this paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly
ramified structure, somehow inspired by that of the Purkinje cells, may produce
a fractional diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves that solve a
hyperbolic equation. This could suggest that the high ramification of the
Purkinje cells might have provided an evolutionary advantage of ""smoothing"" the
transmission of signals and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of
slowing a bit such transmission). Although an experimental confirmation of the
possibility of such evolutionary advantage goes well beyond the goals of this
paper, we think that it is intriguing, as a mathematical counterpart, to
consider the time fractional diffusion as arising from the superposition of
delayed travelling waves in highly ramified transmission media. The case of a
travelling concave parabola with sufficiently small curvature is explicitly
computed. The new link that we propose between time fractional diffusion and
hyperbolic equation also provides a novelty with respect to the usual paradigm
relating time fractional diffusion with parabolic equations in the limit. This
paper is written in such a way as to be of interest to both biologists and

detection algorithm based on Gabor-HOG (GHOG) and low-rank decomposition is
proposed in this paper. Defect-free pattern fabric images have the specified
direction, while defects damage their regularity of direction. Therefore, a
direction-aware descriptor is designed, denoted as GHOG, a combination of Gabor
and HOG, which is extremely valuable for localizing the defect region. Upon
devising a powerful directional descriptor, an efficient low-rank decomposition
model is constructed to divide the matrix generated by the directional feature
extracted from image blocks into a low-rank matrix (background information) and
a sparse matrix (defect information). A nonconvex log det(.) as a smooth
surrogate function for the rank instead of the nuclear norm is also exploited
to improve the efficiency of the low-rank model. Moreover, the computational
efficiency is further improved by utilizing the alternative direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Thereafter, the saliency map generated by the sparse matrix
is segmented via the optimal threshold algorithm to locate the defect regions.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect
patterned fabric defects and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

has focused on methods to enhance interfacial conduction. These approaches
generally address planar interfaces, where the heat flux vector is everywhere
normal to the interface. Here, we explore a nanostructured interface geometry
that uses nonplanar features to enhance the effective interfacial conductance
beyond what is possible with planar interfaces. This interface consists of
interdigitating Al pillars embedded within SiO2 with characteristic feature
size ranging from 100 nm to 800 nm. The total sidewall surface area is
modulated to highlight the impact of this additional channel by changing the
pillar-to-pillar pitch L_P between 1.6 um and 200 nm while maintaining the same
Al:SiO2 fill fraction. Using optical pump-probe thermoreflectance measurements,
we show that the effective conductance of a ~65 nm thick fin layer
monotonically increases with decreasing L_P, and that the conductance for L_P =
200 nm is more than twice the prediction for a layered stack with the same
volume ratio and a planar interface. Through a combination of Boltzmann
transport modeling and finite element calculations, we explore the impact of
the pitch L_P and the pillar aspect ratio on effective thermal conductance.
This analysis suggests that the concept of nanostructured interfaces can be
extended to interfaces between diffusive and quasi-ballistic media in highly
scaled devices. Our work proposes that the controlled texturing of interfaces
can facilitate interfacial conduction beyond the planar interface regime,
opening new avenues for thermal management at the nanoscale.

the $T$ dependence of resistance $R$, we have measured the magnetoresistances
(MR) in perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields. Our $R(T)$ and MR data in
different $T$ intervals are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the
one- (1D), two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) weak-localization (WL) and the
electron-electron interaction (EEI) effects. In particular, a few
dimensionality crossovers in the two effects are observed. These crossover
phenomena are consistent with the model of a ""core-shell-like structure"" in
individual IZO NWs, where an outer shell of a thickness $t$ ($\simeq$ 15-17 nm)
is responsible for the quantum-interference transport. In the WL effect, as the
electron dephasing length $L_\phi$ gradually decreases with increasing $T$ from
the lowest measurement temperatures, a 1D-to-2D dimensionality crossover takes
place around a characteristic temperature where $L_\phi$ approximately equals
$d$, an effective NW diameter which is slightly smaller than the geometric
diameter. As $T$ further increases, a 2D-to-3D dimensionality crossover occurs
around another characteristic temperature where $L_\phi$ approximately equals
$t$ ($< d$). In the EEI effect, a 2D-to-3D dimensionality crossover takes place
when the thermal diffusion length $L_T$ progressively decreases with increasing
$T$ and approaches $t$. However, a crossover to the 1D EEI effect is not seen
because $L_T < d$ even at $T$ = 1 K in our IZO NWs. Furthermore, we explain the
various inelastic electron scattering processes which govern $L_\phi$. This

  Sanit\`a","A $\frac{3}{2}$-Approximation Algorithm for Tree Augmentation via
  Chv\'atal-Gomory Cuts",,,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The weighted tree augmentation problem (WTAP) is a fundamental network design
problem. We are given an undirected tree $G = (V,E)$, an additional set of
edges $L$ called links and a cost vector $c \in \mathbb{R}^L_{\geq 1}$. The
goal is to choose a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq L$ such that $G = (V, E
\cup S)$ is $2$-edge-connected. In the unweighted case, that is, when we have
$c_\ell = 1$ for all $\ell \in L$, the problem is called the tree augmentation
problem (TAP).
  Both problems are known to be APX-hard, and the best known approximation
factors are $2$ for WTAP by (Frederickson and J\'aJ\'a, '81) and $\tfrac{3}{2}$
for TAP due to (Kortsarz and Nutov, TALG '16). In the case where all link costs
are bounded by a constant $M$, (Adjiashvili, SODA '17) recently gave a $\approx
1.96418+\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm for WTAP under this assumption.
This is the first approximation with a better guarantee than $2$ that does not
require restrictions on the structure of the tree or the links.
  In this paper, we improve Adjiashvili's approximation to a
$\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$-approximation for WTAP under the bounded cost
assumption. We achieve this by introducing a strong LP that combines
$\{0,\frac{1}{2}\}$-Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts for the standard LP for the problem
with bundle constraints from Adjiashvili. We show that our LP can be solved
efficiently and that it is exact for some instances that arise at the core of
Adjiashvili's approach. This results in the improved guarantee of
$\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$. For TAP, this is the best known LP-based result, and
matches the bound of $\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$ achieved by the best SDP-based
algorithm due to (Cheriyan and Gao, arXiv '15).

cannot support efficient decision making. SHORT is a tool to simplify that

the property that once values are assigned to them, it is very fast to reason
over the remaining decisions. Using these ""keys"", reasoning about RE models can
be greatly SHORTened by focusing stakeholder discussion on just these key
decisions.
  This paper evaluates the SHORT tool on eight complex RE models. We find that
the number of keys are typically only 12% of all decisions. Since they are so
few in number, keys can be used to reason faster about models. For example,
using keys, we can optimize over those models (to achieve the most goals at
least cost) two to three orders of magnitude faster than standard methods.
Better yet, finding those keys is not difficult: SHORT runs in low order
polynomial time and terminates in a few minutes for the largest models.

low-latency computation for supporting Internet of Things applications.
However, due to the unpredictable arrival of available neighboring fog nodes,
the dynamic formation of a fog network can be challenging. In essence, a given
fog node must smartly select the set of neighboring fog nodes that can provide
low-latency computations. In this paper, this problem of fog network formation
and task distribution is studied considering a hybrid cloud-fog architecture.
The goal of the proposed framework is to minimize the maximum computational
latency by enabling a given fog node to form a suitable fog network, under
uncertainty on the arrival process of neighboring fog nodes. To solve this
problem, a novel approach based on the online secretary framework is proposed.
To find the desired set of neighboring fog nodes, an online algorithm is
developed to enable a task initiating fog node to decide on which other nodes
can be used as part of its fog network, to offload computational tasks, without
knowing any prior information on the future arrivals of those other nodes.
Simulation results show that the proposed online algorithm can successfully
select an optimal set of neighboring fog nodes while achieving a latency that
is as small as the one resulting from an ideal, offline scheme that has
complete knowledge of the system. The results also show how, using the proposed
approach, the computational tasks can be properly distributed between the fog
network and a remote cloud server.

is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-\alpha)$ fraction of the points are
noisy samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $\alpha$ fraction of the

accurately. Existing results for \OR-PCA have serious drawbacks: while some
results are quite weak in the presence of noise, other results have runtime
quadratic in dimension, rendering them impractical for large scale

  In this work, we provide a novel thresholding based iterative algorithm with
per-iteration complexity at most linear in the data size. Moreover, the
fraction of outliers, $\alpha$, that our method can handle is tight up to
constants while providing nearly optimal computational complexity for a general
noise setting. For the special case where the inliers are obtained from a
low-dimensional subspace with additive Gaussian noise, we show that a
modification of our thresholding based method leads to significant improvement

on incomplete or corrupted samples. Consider a random poll of sample size $n$
conducted on a population of individuals, where each pollee is asked to answer
$d$ binary questions. We consider one of the two polling impediments: (a) in
lossy population recovery, a pollee may skip each question with probability
$\epsilon$, (b) in noisy population recovery, a pollee may lie on each question
with probability $\epsilon$. Given $n$ lossy or noisy samples, the goal is to
estimate the probabilities of all $2^d$ binary vectors simultaneously within
accuracy $\delta$ with high probability.
  This paper settles the sample complexity of population recovery. For lossy
model, the optimal sample complexity is
$\tilde\Theta(\delta^{-2\max\{\frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon},1\}})$, improving the
state of the art by Moitra and Saks in several ways: a lower bound is
established, the upper bound is improved and the result depends at most on the
logarithm of the dimension. Surprisingly, the sample complexity undergoes a
phase transition from parametric to nonparametric rate when $\epsilon$ exceeds
$1/2$. For noisy population recovery, the sharp sample complexity turns out to
be more sensitive to dimension and scales as $\exp(\Theta(d^{1/3}
\log^{2/3}(1/\delta)))$ except for the trivial cases of $\epsilon=0,1/2$ or
$1$.
  For both models, our estimators simply compute the empirical mean of a
certain function, which is found by pre-solving a linear program (LP).
Curiously, the dual LP can be understood as Le Cam's method for lower-bounding
the minimax risk, thus establishing the statistical optimality of the proposed
estimators. The value of the LP is determined by complex-analytic methods.

harmonic map heat and Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation, the time variable
remaining continuous. Our starting point is to set out a unified saddle point
approach for both problems in order to impose the unit sphere constraint at the
nodes since the only polynomial function satisfying the unit sphere constraint
everywhere are constants. A proper inf-sup condition is proved for the Lagrange
multiplier leading to the well-posedness of the unified formulation. \emph{A
priori} energy estimates are shown for the proposed method.
  When time integrations are combined with the saddle point finite element
approximation some extra elaborations are required in order to ensure both
\emph{a priori} energy estimates for the director or magnetization vector
depending on the model and an inf-sup condition for the Lagrange multiplier.
This is due to the fact that the unit length at the nodes is not satisfied in
general when a time integration is performed. We will carry out a linear Euler
time-stepping method and a non-linear Crank--Nicolson method. The latter is
solved by using the former as a non-linear solver.

suffers from Photo-Refractive Damage (PRD). This light-induced refractive-index
change hampers the use of CLN when high-power densities are in play, a typical
regime in integrated optics. The resistance to PRD can be largely improved by
doping the lithium-niobate substrates with magnesium oxide. However, the
fabrication of waveguides on MgO-doped substrates is not as effective as for
CLN: either the resistance to PRD is strongly reduced by the waveguide
fabrication process (as it happens in Ti-indiffused waveguides) or the
nonlinear conversion efficiency is lowered (as it occurs in annealed-proton
exchange). Here we fabricate, for the first time, waveguides starting from
MgO-doped substrates using the Soft-Proton Exchange (SPE) technique and we show
that this third way represents a promising alternative. We demonstrate that SPE
allows to produce refractive-index profiles almost identical to those produced
on CLN without reducing the nonlinearity in the substrate. We also prove that
the SPE does not affect substantially the resistance to PRD. Since the
fabrication recipe is identical between CLN and MgO-doped substrates, we
believe that SPE might outperform standard techniques to fabricate robust and
efficient waveguides for high-intensity-beam confinement.

learning of driving behavior and decision making from human driver. More
significantly, the proposed model could accept external navigating instructions

of taxa. This space, denoted $\mathcal{N}(X)$, is defined in terms of two
operations on networks -- the nearest neighbor interchange and triangle
operations -- which can be used to transform any network with leaf set $X$ into
any other network with that leaf set. In particular, it gives rise to a metric
$d$ on $\mathcal N(X)$ which is given by the smallest number of operations
required to transform one network in $\mathcal N(X)$ into another in $\mathcal
N(X)$. The metric generalizes the well-known NNI-metric on phylogenetic trees
which has been intensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we derive
a bound for the metric $d$ as well as a related metric $d_{N\!N\!I}$ which
arises when restricting $d$ to the subset of $\mathcal{N}(X)$ consisting of all
networks with $2(|X|-1+i)$ vertices, $i \ge 1$. We also introduce two new
metrics on networks -- the SPR and TBR metrics -- which generalize the metrics
on phylogenetic trees with the same name and give bounds for these new metrics.
We expect our results to eventually have applications to the development and
understanding of network search algorithms.

travels is estimated through phase shift of multiple carrier frequencies. Due
to phase ambiguity, a unique estimation can only be obtained within the
unambiguous distance (UD), which depends on the carrier frequencies used for
ranging. Without external information, the maximum measurable distance of an
MPR system is defined by its UD. The MPR system employing random frequency
hopping (FH) waveform has a strong anti-jamming capability and sees promising
potentials in many fields. However, it is challenging to depict its measurable
distance. Different from current MPR system employing deterministic
frequencies, the carrier frequency under the FH waveform hops randomly within
the occupied bandwidth. Consequently, the UD is a random variable. In this
paper, we try to find a deterministic value to depict the UD of an MPR system
under the random spaced frequencies (RSF) configuration, serving as a metric of
its measurable distance in engineering applications. It is safe to adopt the
lower bound of the random UD as the metric, but the measurable distance may be
drastically underestimated. Alternatively, we propose to adopt the upper bound
of the random UD as the metric, because when the RSF set contains more than a
dozen of carriers, i) we prove the probability that the random UD obtains its
upper bound is very close to 1 if phase noise is not introduced; ii)
simulations show that the upper bound can also be obtained reliably in the
presence of phase noise. As a comparison, the practical measurable range of the
MPR system under the traditional linearly spaced frequencies (LSF)
configuration is only a fraction of its theoretical UD because the UD is more
sensitive to phase error.

word from a corpus. Recently, neural-network based methods have been proposed
for learning this representation from large corpora. This type of
word-to-vector embedding is able to keep, in the learned vector space, some of
the syntactic and semantic relationships present in the original word corpus.
This, in turn, serves to address different types of language classification
tasks by doing algebraic operations defined on the vectors. The general
practice is to assume that the semantic relationships between the words can be
inferred by the application of a-priori specified algebraic operations. Our
general goal in this paper is to show that it is possible to learn methods for
word composition in semantic spaces. Instead of expressing the compositional
method as an algebraic operation, we will encode it as a program, which can be
linear, nonlinear, or involve more intricate expressions. More remarkably, this
program will be evolved from a set of initial random programs by means of
genetic programming (GP). We show that our method is able to reproduce the same
behavior as human-designed algebraic operators. Using a word analogy task as
benchmark, we also show that GP-generated programs are able to obtain accuracy
values above those produced by the commonly used human-designed rule for
algebraic manipulation of word vectors. Finally, we show the robustness of our
approach by executing the evolved programs on the word2vec GoogleNews vectors,
learned over 3 billion running words, and assessing their accuracy in the same

defined as $\|A\|_p = \left (\sum_{i=1}^{\textrm{rank}(A)}\sigma_i(A)^p \right
)^{1/p}$, where $\sigma_i(A)$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of $A$.
These norms have been studied in functional analysis in the context of
non-commutative $\ell_p$-spaces, and recently in data stream and linear
sketching models of computation. Basic questions on the relations between these
norms, such as their embeddability, are still open. Specifically, given a set
of matrices $A^1, \ldots, A^{\operatorname{poly}(nd)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, suppose we want to construct a linear map $L$ such that $L(A^i) \in
\mathbb{R}^{n' \times d'}$ for each $i$, where $n' \leq n$ and $d' \leq d$, and
further, $\|A^i\|_p \leq \|L(A^i)\|_q \leq D_{p,q} \|A^i\|_p$ for a given
approximation factor $D_{p,q}$ and real number $q \geq 1$. Then how large do
$n'$ and $d'$ need to be as a function of $D_{p,q}$?
  We nearly resolve this question for every $p, q \geq 1$, for the case where
$L(A^i)$ can be expressed as $R \cdot A^i \cdot S$, where $R$ and $S$ are
arbitrary matrices that are allowed to depend on $A^1, \ldots, A^t$, that is,
$L(A^i)$ can be implemented by left and right matrix multiplication. Namely,
for every $p, q \geq 1$, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on
the size of $n'$ and $d'$ as a function of $D_{p,q}$. Importantly, our upper
bounds are {\it oblivious}, meaning that $R$ and $S$ do not depend on the
$A^i$, while our lower bounds hold even if $R$ and $S$ depend on the $A^i$. As
an application of our upper bounds, we answer a recent open question of Blasiok
et al. about space-approximation trade-offs for the Schatten $1$-norm, showing
in a data stream it is possible to estimate the Schatten-$1$ norm up to a
factor of $D \geq 1$ using $\tilde{O}(\min(n,d)^2/D^4)$ space.

five times greater at the Morton site than at the Boulby site due to shorter
reactor-site separation distance, larger reactor thermal power, and greater
neutrino oscillation survival probability. Although the background rate from
all other reactors is larger at Morton than at Boulby, it is a smaller fraction

Moreover, the Hartlepool power plant has two cores whereas the Perry plant has
a single core. The Boulby site, therefore, offers an opportunity for remotely

processed to segment individual trees and subsequently extract tree-level
information. Existing segmentation procedures typically detect more than 90% of
overstory trees, yet they barely detect 60% of understory trees because of the
occlusion effect of higher canopy layers. Although understory trees provide
limited financial value, they are an essential component of ecosystem
functioning by offering habitat for numerous wildlife species and influencing
stand development. Here we model the occlusion effect in terms of point
density. We estimate the fractions of points representing different canopy
layers (one overstory and multiple understory) and also pinpoint the required
density for reasonable tree segmentation (where accuracy plateaus). We show
that at a density of ~170 pt/m-sqr understory trees can likely be segmented as
accurately as overstory trees. Given the advancements of LiDAR sensor
technology, point clouds will affordably reach this required density. Using
modern computational approaches for big data, the denser point clouds can
efficiently be processed to ultimately allow accurate remote quantification of
forest resources. The methodology can also be adopted for other similar remote

Sun-Earth-Moon-Spacecraft system is investigated. Appearance of the finite time
chaotic behaviour suggests that widely used methods and concepts of dynamical
system theory can be useful in constructing a desired mission design. Existing
chaos control methods are modified in such a way that we are able to protect a
test particle from escape. We introduce initial condition maps in order to have
a suitable numerical method to describe the motion in high dimensional phase
space. Results show that the structure of initial condition maps can be split
into two well-defined domains. One of these two parts has a regular contiguous
shape and is responsible for long time escape; it is a long-lived island. The
other one shows a filamentary fractal structure in initial condition maps. The
short time escape is governed by this object. This study focuses on a low-cost
method which successfully transfers a reference trajectory between these two
regions using an appropriate continuous control force. A comparison of the
Earth-Moon transfer is also presented to show the efficiency of our method.

the light-curves of active galaxies (AG) --- Symmetric Achromatic Variability
(SAV) --- a pair of opposed and strongly skewed peaks in the radio flux density
observed over a broad frequency range. We propose that SAV arises through
gravitational milli-lensing when relativistically moving features in AG jets
move through gravitational lensing caustics created by $10^3-10^6 \;{\rm
M}_{\odot}$ subhalo condensates or black holes located within intervening
galaxies. The lower end of this mass range has been inaccessible with previous
gravitational lensing techniques. This new interpretation of some AG
variability can easily be tested and if it passes these tests, will enable a
new and powerful probe of cosmological matter distribution on these
intermediate mass scales, as well as provide, for the first time,
micro-arcsecond resolution of the nuclei of AG --- a factor of 30--100 greater
resolution than is possible with ground-based millimeter VLBI.

localization method featuring a novel phase-based ranging process. Multipath is
the limiting error source for RIPS in ground-deployed scenarios or indoor
applications. There are four distinct channels involved in the ranging process
for RIPS. Multipath reflections affect both the phase and amplitude of the
ranging signal for each channel. By exploiting untapped amplitude information,
we put forward a scheme to estimate each channel's multipath profile, which is
then subsequently used to correct corresponding errors in phase measurements.
Simulations show that such a scheme is very effective in reducing multipath
phase errors, which are essentially brought down to the level of receiver noise
under moderate multipath conditions. It is further demonstrated that ranging
errors in RIPS are also greatly reduced via the proposed scheme.

  Filtering",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For tackling the well known cold-start user problem in model-based
recommender systems, one approach is to recommend a few items to a cold-start
user and use the feedback to learn a profile. The learned profile can then be
used to make good recommendations to the cold user. In the absence of a good
initial profile, the recommendations are like random probes, but if not chosen
judiciously, both bad recommendations and too many recommendations may turn off
a user. We formalize the cold-start user problem by asking what are the $b$
best items we should recommend to a cold-start user, in order to learn her
profile most accurately, where $b$, a given budget, is typically a small
number. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem and present
multiple non-trivial results, including NP-hardness as well as hardness of
approximation. We furthermore show that the objective function, i.e., the least
square error of the learned profile w.r.t. the true user profile, is neither
submodular nor supermodular, suggesting efficient approximations are unlikely
to exist. Finally, we discuss several scalable heuristic approaches for
identifying the $b$ best items to recommend to the user and experimentally
evaluate their performance on 4 real datasets. Our experiments show that our
proposed accelerated algorithms significantly outperform the prior art in
runnning time, while achieving similar error in the learned user profile as
well as in the rating predictions.
