  Szemeredi Theorem","28 pages",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper is primarily concerned with the asymptotic behavior as $N\to\infty$
of averages of nonconventional arrays having the form
$N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^N\prod_{j=1}^\ell T^{P_j(n,N)}f_j$ where $f_j$'s are bounded
measurable functions, $T$ is an invertible measure preserving transformation
and $P_j$'s are polynomials of $n$ and $N$ taking on integer values on
integers. It turns out that when $T$ is weakly mixing and $P_j(n,N)=p_jn+q_jN$
are linear or, more generally, have the form $P_j(n,N)=P_j(n)+Q_j(N)$ for some
integer valued polynomials $P_j$ and $Q_j$ then the above averages converge in
$L^2$ but for general polynomials $P_j$ the $L^2$ convergence can be ensured
even in the case $\ell=1$ only when $T$ is strongly mixing. Studying also
weakly mixing and compact extensions and relying on Furstenberg's structure
theorem we derive an extension of Szemer\' edi's theorem saying that for any
subset of integers $\Lambda$ with positive upper density there exists a subset
$\mathcal N_\Lambda$ of positive integers having uniformly bounded gaps such
that for $N\in\mathcal N_\Lambda$ and at least $\varepsilon N,\,\varepsilon>0$
of $n$'s all numbers $p_jn+q_jN,\, j=1,...,\ell$ belong to $\Lambda$. We obtain
also a version of these results for several commuting transformations which
yields a corresponding extension of the multidimensional Szemer\' edi theorem.

holes of about 30 solar masses each challenges our incomplete understanding of
massive stars and their evolution. Critical ingredients comprise mass-loss,
rotation, magnetic fields, internal mixing, and mass transfer in close binary
systems. The imperfect knowledge of these factors implies large uncertainties
for models of stellar populations and their feedback. In this contribution we
summarize our empirical studies of Wolf-Rayet populations at different
metallicities by means of modern non-LTE stellar atmosphere models, and
confront these results with the predictions of stellar evolution models. At the
metallicity of our Galaxy, stellar winds are probably too strong to leave
remnant masses as high as 30 solar masses, but given the still poor agreement
between evolutionary tracks and observation even this conclusion is debatable.
At the low metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud, all WN stars which are
(at least now) single are consistent with evolving quasi-homogeneously. O and
B-type stars, in contrast, seem to comply with standard evolutionary models
without strong internal mixing. Close binaries which avoided early merging
could evolve quasi-homogeneously and lead to close compact remnants of
relatively high masses that merge within a Hubble time.

We consider the antenna specific maximum power constraints to avoid non-linear
distortion in power amplifiers and user-specific quality of service (QoS)
constraints to guarantee a certain QoS levels. We first introduce binary
antenna selection variables and use the perspective formulation to model the
relation between them and the beamformers. Subsequently, we propose a new
formulation which reduces the feasible set of the continuous relaxation,
resulting in better performance compared to the original perspective
formulation based problem. However, the resulting optimization problem is a
mixed-Boolean non-convex fractional program, which is difficult to solve. We
follow the standard continuous relaxation of the binary antenna selection
variables, and then reformulate the problem such that it is amendable to
successive convex approximation. Thereby, solving the continuous relaxation
mostly results in near-binary solution. To recover the binary variables from
the continuous relaxation, we switch off all the antennas for which the
continuous values are smaller than a small threshold. Numerical results
illustrate the superior convergence result and significant achievable gains in
terms of energy efficiency with the proposed algorithm.

between science and non-science. While parts of the physics community see the
situation as a beginning epistemic shift in what defines science, others deny
that the traditional criterion of empirical testability can or should be
changed. As demonstrated by the history of physics, it is not the first time
that drastic revisions of theory assessment have been proposed. Although
historical reflection has little to offer modern physicists in a technical
sense, it does offer a broader and more nuanced perspective on the present
debate. This paper suggests that history of science is of some indirect value
to modern physicists and philosophers dealing with string theory, multiverse
scenarios, and related theoretical ideas.

clustering by constructing a graph over image regions with both global and
local connections. Our novel approach to build graph connections relies on two
key observations: 1) local region pairs that co-occur frequently will have a
high probability to reside on a common object; 2) spatially distant regions in
a common object often exhibit similar visual saliency, which implies their
neighborship in a manifold. We present a novel energy function to efficiently
conduct graph partitioning. Based on multiple high quality partitions, we show
that the generated eigenvector histogram based representation can automatically
drive effective unary potentials for a hierarchical random field model to
produce multi-class segmentation. Sufficient experiments, on the BSDS500

competitive segmentation accuracy and significantly improved efficiency of our
proposed method compared with other state of the arts.

For 35 or more qubits per segment one can achieve computation on a meaningful

estimation is realizable. We unify the results of two approaches. In the first
one, the original system is compared with its copy rotated by the parameter
dependent dynamics. If the parameter is coupled to the one-body part of the
Hamiltonian the precision of its estimation is known to scale at most as
$N^{-1}$ (Heisenberg scaling) in terms of the number of elementary subsystems
used, $N$. The second approach considers fidelity at criticality often leading
to an apparent super-Heisenberg scaling. However, scaling of time needed to
ensure adiabaticity of the evolution brings back the the Heisenberg limit. We
illustrate the general theory on a ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain which
exhibits such super-Heisenberg scaling of fidelity around the critical value of
the magnetic field. Even an elementary estimator represented by a single-site
magnetization already outperforms the Heisenberg behavior providing the
$N^{-1.5}$ scaling. In this case Fisher information sets the ultimate scaling
as $N^{-1.75}$ which can be saturated by measuring magnetization on all sites
simultaneously. We discuss universal scaling predictions of the estimation
precision offered by such observables, both at zero and finite temperatures,
and support them with numerical simulations in the model. We provide an
experimental proposal of realization of the considered model via mapping the
system to ultra-cold bosons in periodically shaken optical lattice. We
explicitly derive that the Heisenberg limit is recovered when time needed for
preparation of quantum states involved is taken into acocunt.

particular, there exist properties for which there is an exponential gap
between the power of \emph{adaptive} testing algorithms, wherein each query may
be determined by the answers received to prior queries, and their
\emph{non-adaptive} counterparts, in which all queries are independent of
answers obtained from previous queries.
  In this work, we investigate the role of adaptivity in property testing at a
finer level. We first quantify the degree of adaptivity of a testing algorithm
by considering the number of ""rounds of adaptivity"" it uses. More accurately,
we say that a tester is $k$-(round) adaptive if it makes queries in $k+1$
rounds, where the queries in the $i$'th round may depend on the answers
obtained in the previous $i-1$ rounds. Then, we ask the following question:
  Does the power of testing algorithms smoothly grow with the number of rounds
of adaptivity?
  We provide a positive answer to the foregoing question by proving an
adaptivity hierarchy theorem for property testing. Specifically, our main
result shows that for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \le k \le n^{0.99}$ there
exists a property $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ of functions for which (1) there exists a
$k$-adaptive tester for $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ with query complexity
$\tilde{O}(k)$, yet (2) any $(k-1)$-adaptive tester for $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$
must make $\Omega(n)$ queries. In addition, we show that such a qualitative
adaptivity hierarchy can be witnessed for testing natural properties of graphs.

  (ISIT), 2017",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Joint allocation of spectrum and user association is considered for a large
cellular network. The objective is to optimize a network utility function such
as average delay given traffic statistics collected over a slow timescale. A
key challenge is scalability: given $n$ Access Points (APs), there are $O(2^n)$
ways in which the APs can share the spectrum. The number of variables is
reduced from $O(2^n)$ to $O(nk)$, where $k$ is the number of users, by
optimizing over local overlapping neighborhoods, defined by interference
conditions, and by exploiting the existence of sparse solutions in which the
spectrum is divided into $k+1$ segments. We reformulate the problem by
optimizing the assignment of subsets of active APs to those segments. An
$\ell_0$ constraint enforces a one-to-one mapping of subsets to spectrum, and
an iterative (reweighted $\ell_1$) algorithm is used to find an approximate
solution. Numerical results for a network with 100 APs serving several hundred
users show the proposed method achieves a substantial increase in total
throughput relative to benchmark schemes.

magnetic flux in the protoplanetary disks. To answer it, a detailed
self-consistent chemical evolution is needed to describe the magnetic
dissipation in the collapsing core accurately. We use a chemo-dynamical version
of RAMSES to follow the evolution of collapsing dense cores for a range in the
dust size assumptions. The number density of dust and it's mean size are
affecting the efficiency of the charge capturing and thus the chemistry. The
chemical abundances for the range of dust sizes are produced by RAMSES and
serve as an input to calculations of Ohmic, ambipolar and Hall diffusivity
terms. We find that Ohmic resistivity only plays a role at the late stage of
the collapse where gas density exceeds few times $10^{13}\rm cm^{-3}$.
Ambipolar diffusion is a dominant magnetic diffusivity term in cases where mean
dust size is a typical ISM value or larger. We show that the assumption of a
fixed 'dominant ion' mass can change the ambipolar diffusion up to one order of
magnitude. 'Negative' Hall effect is dominant during the collapse in case of
mean dust size of 0.02 $\mu$m and smaller, the effect which we connect to the
dominance of negatively charged grains. We find that the Hall effect's sign
reversal is depending on relative contribution of negatively charged dust to
the hall conductivity. The dust grain mean size appears to be the parameter
dividing the collapsing clouds in Hall-dominated and ambipolar-dominated
clouds, and thus affecting the size of the new-born disks. We propose to link
the dust properties and the occurance and size of disk structures in Class 0
YSO's. The proper accounting for dust grain growth in the radiative
magneto-hydrodynamical collapse models appear to be be as important as coupling
the dynamics of the collapse with the chemistry.

tighter correlation between $\gamma$-ray luminosity and the lower energy ones.

component analysis (OMWRPCA). Unlike existing algorithms, OMWRPCA can
successfully track not only slowly changing subspace but also abruptly changed
subspace. By embedding hypothesis testing into the algorithm, OMWRPCA can
detect change points of the underlying subspaces. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate the superior performance of OMWRPCA compared with other
state-of-art approaches. We also apply the algorithm for real-time background

  Malware",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The astonishing spread of Android OS, not only in smartphones and tablets but
also in IoT devices, makes this operating system a very tempting target for
malware threats. Indeed, the latter are expanding at a similar rate. In this
respect, malware fingerprints, whether based on cryptographic or fuzzy-hashing,
are the first defense line against such attacks. Fuzzy-hashing fingerprints are
suitable for capturing malware static features. Moreover, they are more
resilient to small changes in the actual static content of malware files. On
the other hand, dynamic analysis is another technique for malware detection
that uses emulation environments to extract behavioral features of Android
malware. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such fingerprinting
technique that leverages dynamic analysis and would act as the first defense
against Android malware attacks. In this paper, we address the following
question: could we generate effective fingerprints for Android malware through
dynamic analysis? To this end, we propose DySign, a novel technique for
fingerprinting Android malware's dynamic behaviors. This is achieved through
the generation of a digest from the dynamic analysis of a malware sample on
existing known malware. It is important to mention that: (i) DySign
fingerprints are approximated of the observed behaviors during dynamic analysis
so as to achieve resiliency to small changes in the behaviors of future malware
variants; (ii) Fingerprint computation is agnostic to the analyzed malware
sample or family. DySign leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques to generate the aforementioned fingerprints, which are then
leveraged to build an enhanced Android malware detection system with family
attribution.

biological processes, including a number of human diseases. The detection of
this small modification remains challenging. In this work, we computationally
explore the possibility of detecting methylated DNA strands through direct
electrical conductance measurements. Using density functional theory and the
Landauer-Buttiker method, we study the electronic properties and charge
transport through an eight base-pair methylated DNA strand and its native
counterpart. We first analyze the effect of cytosine methylation on the
tight-binding parameters of two DNA strands and then model the transmission of
the electrons and conductance through the strands both with and without
decoherence. We find that the main difference of the tight-binding parameters
between the native DNA and the methylated DNA lies in the on-site energies of
(methylated) cytosine bases. The intra- and inter- strand hopping integrals
between two nearest neighboring guanine base and (methylated) cytosine base
also change with the addition of the methyl groups. Our calculations show that
in the phase-coherent limit, the transmission of the methylated strand is close
to the native strand when the energy is nearby the highest occupied molecular
orbital level and larger than the native strand by 5 times in the bandgap. The
trend in transmission also holds in the presence of the decoherence with the
same rate. The lower conductance for the methylated strand in the experiment is
suggested to be caused by the more stable structure due to the introduction of
the methyl groups. We also study the role of the exchangecorrelation functional
and the effect of contact coupling by choosing coupling strengths ranging from
weak to strong coupling limit.

given setting is often challenging. Recent approaches address this challenge by
learning performance models based on a sample set of configurations. However,
building an accurate performance model can be very expensive (and is often
infeasible in practice). The central insight of this paper is that exact
performance values (e.g. the response time of a software system) are not
required to rank configurations and to identify the optimal one. As shown by
our experiments, models that are cheap to learn but inaccurate (with respect to
the difference between actual and predicted performance) can still be used rank
configurations and hence find the optimal configuration. This novel
\emph{rank-based approach} allows us to significantly reduce the cost (in terms
of number of measurements of sample configuration) as well as the time required
to build models. We evaluate our approach with 21 scenarios based on 9 software
systems and demonstrate that our approach is beneficial in 16 scenarios; for
the remaining 5 scenarios, an accurate model can be built by using very few
samples anyway, without the need for a rank-based approach.

several reasonable definitions formalizing this idea. We investigate the
computational complexity of deciding whether a given network is atomic
according to each of these definitions.
  Our first definition, primitive atomic, which requires each reaction to
preserve the total number of atoms, is to shown to be equivalent to mass
conservation. Since it is known that it can be decided in polynomial time
whether a given chemical reaction network is mass-conserving, the equivalence
gives an efficient algorithm to decide primitive atomicity.
  Another definition, subset atomic, further requires that all atoms are
species. We show that deciding whether a given network is subset atomic is in
$\textsf{NP}$, and the problem ""is a network subset atomic with respect to a

it into its constituent atoms. We show that there is a $\textbf{polynomial-time

necessitated the need to consider variety of user and base station (BS)
configurations for realistic performance evaluation and system design. This is
directly reflected in the HetNet simulation models considered by
standardization bodies, such as the third generation partnership project
(3GPP). Complementary to these simulation models, stochastic geometry based
approach modeling the user and BS locations as independent and homogeneous
Poisson point processes (PPPs) has gained prominence in the past few years.
Despite its success in revealing useful insights, this PPP-based model is not
rich enough to capture all the spatial configurations that appear in real world
HetNet deployments (on which 3GPP simulation models are based). In this paper,
we bridge the gap between the 3GPP simulation models and the popular PPP-based
analytical model by developing a new unified HetNet model in which a fraction
of users and some BS tiers are modeled as Poisson cluster processes (PCPs).
This model captures both non-uniformity and coupling in the BS and user
locations. For this setup, we derive exact expression for downlink coverage
probability under maximum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) cell association
model. As intermediate results, we define and evaluate sum-product functionals
for PPP and PCP. Special instances of the proposed model are shown to closely
resemble different configurations considered in 3GPP HetNet models. Our results
concretely demonstrate that the performance trends are highly sensitive to the
assumptions made on the user and SBS configurations.

effective strain value is calibrated using the Raman spectroscopy and corrected
for a relaxation of wrinkles and folds seen directly by atomic-force

Dafermos and Dafermos-Rodnianski that the maximal globally hyperbolic future
development of any admissible two-ended asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data
set possesses a non-empty Cauchy horizon, across which the spacetime is
$C^{0}$-future-extendible (in particular, the $C^{0}$-formulation of the strong
cosmic censorship conjecture is false). Nevertheless, the main conclusion of
the present series of papers is that for a generic (in the sense of being open
and dense relative to appropriate topologies) class of such data, the spacetime
is future-inextendible with a Lorentzian metric of higher regularity
(specifically, $C^{2}$).
  In this paper, we prove that the solution is $C^{2}$-future-inextendible
under the condition that the scalar field obeys an $L^{2}$-averaged polynomial
lower bound along each of the event horizons. This, in particular, improves
upon a previous result of Dafermos, which required instead a pointwise lower
bound. Key to the proof are appropriate stability and instability results in
the interior of the black hole region, whose proofs are in turn based on ideas
from the work of Dafermos-Luk on the stability of the Kerr Cauchy horizon
(without symmetry) and from our previous paper on linear instability of
Reissner-Nordstr\""om Cauchy horizon. In the second paper of the series

that this lower bound is indeed satisfied for solutions arising from a generic

error of size $\epsilon$, the initial Bondi mass is $M_i$ and the final Bondi
mass is $M_f$. Moreover, if one assumes a continuity property of the final
Bondi mass (which in principle follows from known techniques in the
literature), then for $M_i>M_f>0$, the above result holds without an
$\epsilon$-error.

restricted to strategies requiring no more than a limited amount of randomness.
Particularly, we analyze the maxmin payoff of the maximizer in two models: the
first model forces the maximizer to randomize her action in each stage just by
conditioning her decision to outcomes of a given sequence of random source,
whereas, in the second model, the maximizer is a team of players who are free
to privately randomize their corresponding actions but do not have access to
any explicit source of shared randomness needed for cooperation. The works of
Gossner and Vieille, and Gossner and Tomala adopted the method of types to
establish their results; however, we utilize the idea of random hashing which
is the core of randomness extractors in the information theory literature. In
addition, we adopt the well-studied tool of simulation of a source from another
source. By utilizing these tools, we are able to simplify the prior results and
generalize them as well. We characterize the maxmin payoff of the maximizer in
the repeated games under study. Particularly, the maxmin payoff of the first
model is fully described by the function $J(h)$ which is the maximum payoff
that the maximizer can secure in a one-shot game by choosing mixed strategies
of entropy at most $h$. In the second part of the paper, we study the
computational aspects of $J(h)$. We offer three explicit lower bounds on the
entropy-payoff trade-off curve. To do this, we provide and utilize new results
for the set of distributions that guarantee a certain payoff for Alice. In
particular, we study how this set of distributions shrinks as we increase the
security level. While the use of total variation distance is common in game
theory, our derivation indicates the suitability of utilizing the
Renyi-divergence of order two.

Variability operations are an instrument to realize flexibility by explicitly
declaring required modifications, which are applied to create a procedurally
generated company-specific process. However, little is known about which
variability operations are suitable in practice. In this article, we present a
study on the feasibility of variability operations to support the development
of software process lines in the context of the V-Modell XT. We analyze which
variability operations are defined and practically used. We provide an initial
catalog of variability operations as an improvement proposal for other process
models. Our findings show that 69 variability operation types are defined

altering the structure of a process model and its description. Furthermore, we

for a hot QCD medium that is produced while colliding two heavy nuclei
ultra-relativistically. As the hot QCD medium follows dissipative hydrodynamics
while undergoing space-time evolution, the knowledge of the transport
coefficients such as thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, shear and
bulk viscosities are essential to understand the underlying physics there. The
approach adopted here is semi-classical transport theory. The determination of
all these transport coefficients requires knowledge of the medium away from
equilibrium. In this context, we setup the linearized transport equation
employing the Chapman-Enskog technique from kinetic theory of many particle
system with a collision term that includes the binary collisions of
quarks/antiquarks and gluons. In order to include the effects of a strongly
interacting, thermal medium, a quasi-particle description of realistic hot QCD
equation of state has been employed through the equilibrium modeling of the
momentum distributions of gluons and quarks with non-trivial dispersion
relations while extending the model for finite but small quark chemical
potential. The effective coupling for strong interaction has been redefined
following the charge renormalization under the scheme of the quasiparticle
model. The consolidated effects on transport coefficients are seen to have
significant impact on their temperature dependence. The relative significances
of momentum and heat transfer as well as charge diffusion processes in hot QCD
have been investigated by studying the ratios of the respective transport
coefficients.

QCD predictions and also the validity of parton densities in the nucleon and
nuclei especially of the gluon. In this work, we have performed a detailed
study on this subject focusing on the isolated prompt photon production in $ p
$-Pb collisions at forward rapidity at the LHC. The impact of input nuclear
modifications obtained from different global analyses by various groups on
several quantities has been investigated to estimate the order of magnitude of
the difference between their predictions. We have also studied in detail the
theoretical uncertainties in the results due to various sources. We found that
there is a remarkable difference between the predictions from the nCTEQ15 and
other groups in all ranges of photon transverse momentum $ p_\textrm{T}^\gamma
$. Their differences become more explicit in the calculation of the nuclear
modification ratio and also the yield asymmetry between the forward and
backward rapidities rather than single differential cross sections. We
emphasize that future measurements with ALICE will be very useful not only for
decreasing the uncertainty of the gluon nuclear modification, but also to
accurately determine its central values, especially in the shadowing region.

introduced to realize low disk I/O and repair cost. In order to tolerate
multiple node failures, the LRCs with \emph{$(r, \delta)$-locality} are further
proposed. Since hot data is not uncommon in a distributed storage system, both
Zeh \emph{et al.} and Kadhe \emph{et al.} focus on the LRCs with \emph{multiple
localities or unequal localities} (ML-LRCs) recently, which said that the
localities among the code symbols can be different. ML-LRCs are attractive and
useful in reducing repair cost for hot data. In this paper, we generalize the
ML-LRCs to the $(r,\delta)$-locality case of multiple node failures, and define
an LRC with multiple $(r_{i}, \delta_{i})_{i\in [s]}$ localities ($s\ge 2$),
where $r_{1}\leq r_{2}\leq\dots\leq r_{s}$ and
$\delta_{1}\geq\delta_{2}\geq\dots\geq\delta_{s}\geq2$. Such codes ensure that
some hot data could be repaired more quickly and have better failure-tolerance
in certain cases because of relatively smaller $r_{i}$ and larger $\delta_{i}$.
Then, we derive a Singleton-like upper bound on the minimum distance for the
proposed LRCs by employing the regenerating-set technique. Finally, we obtain a
class of explicit and structured constructions of optimal ML-LRCs, and further
extend them to the cases of multiple $(r_{i}, \delta)_{i\in [s]}$ localities.

DR$^{2}$-Net consists of two components, \emph{i.e.,} linear mapping network

hash regions [Charikar, STOC 2002]. Experiments later showed that using a set
of \textit{orthogonal} hyperplanes, thereby partitioning the space into the
Voronoi regions induced by a hypercube, leads to even better results [Terasawa
and Tanaka, WADS 2007]. However, no theoretical explanation for this
improvement was ever given, and it remained unclear how the resulting hypercube
hash method scales in high dimensions.
  In this work, we provide explicit asymptotics for the collision probabilities
when using hypercubes to partition the space. For instance, two near-orthogonal
vectors are expected to collide with probability $(\frac{1}{\pi})^{d + o(d)}$
in dimension $d$, compared to $(\frac{1}{2})^d$ when using random hyperplanes.
Vectors at angle $\frac{\pi}{3}$ collide with probability
$(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi})^{d + o(d)}$, compared to $(\frac{2}{3})^d$ for random
hyperplanes, and near-parallel vectors collide with similar asymptotic
probabilities in both cases.
  For $c$-approximate nearest neighbor searching, this translates to a decrease
in the exponent $\rho$ of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) methods of a factor
up to $\log_2(\pi) \approx 1.652$ compared to hyperplane LSH. For $c = 2$, we
obtain $\rho \approx 0.302 + o(1)$ for hypercube LSH, improving upon the $\rho
\approx 0.377$ for hyperplane LSH. We further describe how to use hypercube LSH
in practice, and we consider an example application in the area of lattice
algorithms.

nonuniformity correction of infrared focal plane arrays. The proposed method

the fixed pattern noise from pixel sized translations of the focal plane array,
the proposed method has the advantages of being invariant to the noise
magnitude and robust to unknown camera and inter-scene movements while being
virtually transparent to the end-user.

dependence of the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at

generalized Fokker-Plank (FP) solution can not describe the spectra of pions,
kaons and protons from central to peripheral collisions in the entire $p_T$
region, simultaneously. Hence, a new two-component distribution, which is a
hydrodynamic extension of the generalized FP solution accounting for the
collective motion effect in heavy-ion collisions, is proposed in order to
reproduce all the particle spectra. Our results suggest that the particle
production dynamics may be different for different particles, especially at
very low $p_T$ region.

x-ray free electron laser pulses. By taking advantage of the curvature of the
Ewald sphere and the symmetry of the nanoparticle, we reconstructed the 3D
electron density of 34 core-shell structures from single-shot diffraction

the 3D elemental distribution inside the nanoparticles with an accuracy better

and a nonstatic spherically symmetric black hole. In case of static black hole,
tunnelling of nonzero mass particles is considered and due to complicated
calculations, quantum corrections are calculated only up to the first order.
The results are compared with those for massless particles near the horizon. On
the other hand, for dynamical black hole, quantum corrections are incorporated
using the Hamilton-Jacobi method beyond semiclassical approximation. It is
found that different order correction terms satisfy identical differential
equation and are solved by a typical technique. Finally, using the law of black
hole mechanics, a general modified form of the black hole entropy is obtained
considering modified Hawking temperature.

thickness and shape of the region where viscous forces are dominant in

presently employed, the new method defines thickness and shape parameters that
are experimentally accessible without differentiation. It is shown
theoretically that one of the new length parameters used as a scaling parameter
is also a similarity parameter for the velocity profile. In fact, we show that
this new length scale parameter removes one of the theoretical inconsistencies
present in the traditional Prandtl Plus scaling's. Furthermore, the new length
parameter and the Prandtl Plus scaling parameters perform identically when
operating on experimental datasets if the Rotta similarity constraint
(u_tau/u_e = constant) holds. This means that many of the past successes
ascribed to the Prandtl Plus scaling also apply to the new parameter set but
without one of the theoretical inconsistencies. Examples are offered to show
how the new description method is useful in exploring the actual physics of the
boundary layer.
