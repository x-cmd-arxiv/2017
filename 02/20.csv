normalized). Milman's random version of Dvoretzky's theorem shows that a large
initial segment of this sequence is essentially constant, up to a critical
parameter called the Dvoretzky number. We show that this near-constant behavior
actually extends further, up to a different parameter associated with $A$. This
yields a new quantitative reverse inequality that sits between the approximate
reverse Urysohn inequality, due to Figiel--Tomczak-Jaegermann and Pisier, and
the sharp reverse Urysohn inequality for zonoids, due to Hug--Schneider. In
fact, we study concentration properties of the volume radius and mean width of
random projections of $A$ and show how these lead naturally to such reversals.

class of CA graphs, which we call uniform, it suffices to compute a CA
representation to find such flip sets. As a consequence canonical
representations for uniform CA graphs can be obtained in polynomial-time. We
then investigate what kind of CA graphs pose a challenge to this approach. This
leads us to introduce the notion of restricted CA matrices and show that the
canonical representation problem for CA graphs is logspace-reducible to that of
restricted CA matrices. As a byproduct, we obtain the result that CA graphs
without induced 4-cycles can be canonized in logspace.

significantly to the quality of embedding and the exponential function is

increments $u(r)$ in scale $r$ in which the jumps occur randomly but with
deterministic width in $u$. From its master equation we establish a
prescription to simulate the She-Leveque process and compare it with Kolmogorov
scaling. To put the She-Leveque process into the context of other established
turbulence models on the Markov level, we derive a diffusion process for $u(r)$
from two properties of the Navier-Stokes equation. This diffusion process
already includes Kolmogorov scaling, extended self-similarity and a class of
random cascade models. The fluctuation theorem of this Markov process implies a
""second law"" that puts a loose bound on the multipliers of the random cascade
models. This bound explicitly allows for inverse cascades, which are necessary
to satisfy the fluctuation theorem. By adding a jump process to the diffusion
process, we go beyond Kolmogorov scaling and formulate the most general scaling
law for the class of Markov processes having both diffusion and jump parts.
This Markov scaling law includes She-Leveque scaling and a scaling law derived
by Yakhot.

challenges, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict
quantum-mechanically-derived properties, including spin-state ordering,
sensitivity to Hartree-Fock exchange, and spin- state specific bond lengths in
transition metal complexes. Our ANN is trained on a small set of
inorganic-chemistry-appropriate empirical inputs that are both maximally
transferable and do not require precise three-dimensional structural
information for prediction. Using these descriptors, our ANN predicts
spin-state splittings of single-site transition metal complexes (i.e., Cr-Ni)
at arbitrary amounts of Hartree-Fock exchange to within 3 kcal/mol accuracy of
DFT calculations. Our exchange-sensitivity ANN enables improved predictions on
a diverse test set of experimentally-characterized transition metal complexes
by extrapolation from semi-local DFT to hybrid DFT. The ANN also outperforms
other machine learning models (i.e., support vector regression and kernel ridge
regression), demonstrating particularly improved performance in
transferability, as measured by prediction errors on the diverse test set. We
establish the value of new uncertainty quantification tools to estimate ANN
prediction uncertainty in computational chemistry, and we provide additional

improving the localization accuracy. It will be shown in this paper that
localization accuracy can be enhanced using crude GNSS measurements from a

Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is used to jointly estimate the common
biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicle positions. Multipath biases, which
introduce receiver-specific (non-common) error, are mitigated by a
multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation of the

approach is compared to existing methods using both simulations and

labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. We then
give an equivalent relational semantics, itself proven equivalent to an

ways. First, we prove decidability of the logic by showing the finite
embeddability property holds for the algebraic semantics. Second, we prove a
Stone-type duality theorem for the logic. By introducing the notions of ILGL
hyperdoctrine and indexed layered frame we are able to extend this result to a

complete graph on $n$ vertices at the critical point $\beta_c(q)$,
Swendsen-Wang dynamics has $t_{\mathrm{mix}}\geq \exp(c\sqrt n)$. The same

new vulnerability models are derived that connect the severity of seven impact
effects (strong winds, overpressure shockwave, thermal radiation, seismic
shaking, ejecta deposition, cratering and tsunamis) with lethality to human
populations. With the new vulnerability models ARMOR estimates casualties of an
impact under consideration of the local population and geography. The presented
algorithms and models are employed in two case studies to estimate total

serve a protective function against the tsunami hazard caused by impactors on

of nodes in a directed graph on $n$ nodes, $m$ edges,and capacities in the
range $[1..n]$, which we call the All-Pairs Max-Flow problem, cannot be solved
in time that is significantly faster (i.e., by a polynomial factor) than
$O(n^3)$ even for sparse graphs. Since a single maximum $st$-flow can be solved
in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ [Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014], we conclude that
the all-pairs version might require time equivalent to $\tilde\Omega(n^{3/2})$
computations of maximum $st$-flow,which strongly separates the directed case
from the undirected one. Moreover, if maximum $st$-flow can be solved in time
$\tilde{O}(m)$,then the runtime of $\tilde\Omega(n^2)$ computations is needed.
The latter settles a conjecture of Lacki, Nussbaum, Sankowski, and Wulf-Nilsen
[FOCS 2012] negatively.
  Specifically, we show that in sparse graphs $G=(V,E,w)$, if one can compute
the maximum $st$-flow from every $s$ in an input set of sources $S\subseteq V$
to every $t$ in an input set of sinks $T\subseteq V$ in time $O((|S| |T|
m)^{1-\epsilon})$,for some $|S|$, $|T|$, and a constant $\epsilon>0$,then
MAX-CNF-SAT with $n'$ variables and $m'$ clauses can be solved in time
${m'}^{O(1)}2^{(1-\delta)n'}$ for a constant $\delta(\epsilon)>0$,a problem for
which not even $2^{n'}/poly(n')$ algorithms are known. Such runtime for
MAX-CNF-SAT would in particular refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis
(SETH). Hence, we improve the lower bound of Abboud, Vassilevska-Williams, and
Yu [STOC 2015], who showed that for every fixed $\epsilon>0$ and
$|S|=|T|=O(\sqrt{n})$, if the above problem can be solved in time
$O(n^{3/2-\epsilon})$, then some incomparable conjecture is false. Furthermore,
a larger lower bound than ours implies strictly super-linear time for maximum
$st$-flow problem, which would be an amazing breakthrough.

classical entropy in statistical mechanics remains a subject of debate. The
Boltzmann entropy (calculated from a surface in phase space) has been
criticized as not being an adiabatic invariant. It has been suggested that the
Gibbs entropy (volume in phase space) is correct, which would forbid the
concept of negative temperatures. An apparently innocuous assumption turns out
to be responsible for much of the controversy, namely, that the energy $E$ and
the number of particles $N$ are given exactly. The true distributions are known
to be extremely narrow (of order $1/\sqrt{N}$), so that it is surprising that
this is a problem. The canonical and grand canonical ensembles provide
alternative expressions for the entropy that satisfy all requirements. The
consequences are that negative temperatures are thermodynamically valid, the
validity of the Gibbs entropy is limited to increasing densities of states, and
the completely correct expression for the entropy is given by the grand
canonical formulation. The Boltzmann entropy is shown to provide an excellent
approximation in almost all cases.

  Lightning",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as deployed
today, cannot scale for wide-spread use. A leading approach for cryptocurrency
scaling is a smart contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables
two mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a
single transaction in the blockchain to set-up). Payment channels can be linked
together to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties
can (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them.
Crucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route.
  In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called
Sprites, that reduces the worst-case ""collateral cost"" that each hop along the
route may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network,
a payment across a path of $\ell$ channels requires locking up collateral for
$\Theta(\ell\Delta)$ time, where $\Delta$ is the time to commit an on-chain
transaction. Sprites reduces this cost to $O(\ell + \Delta)$. 2) Unlike prior
work, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the
channel can continue to operate without interruption.
  In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our
simulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing
guarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of
a generic abstraction from folklore, called the ""state channel,"" which we are
the first to formalize. We also provide a simulation framework for payment
network protocols, which we use to confirm that the Sprites construction
mitigates against throughput-reducing attacks.

Here we introduce an approach that relies on the resonant driving of nearby
environment spins, whose localised magnetic field in turn drives the qubit when
the environmental spin Rabi frequency matches the qubit resonance. This concept
of environmentally mediated resonance (EMR) is explored experimentally using a
qubit based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, with nearby
electronic spins serving as the environmental mediators. We demonstrate EMR
driven coherent control of the NV spin-state, including the observation of Rabi
oscillations, free induction decay, and spin-echo. This technique also provides
a way to probe the nanoscale environment of spin qubits, which we illustrate by
acquisition of electron spin resonance spectra of single NV centres in various
settings.

communication Brian Conrey asked how fast the number of real zeros of the
trigonometric polynomials $T_N(\theta) = \sum_{j=1}^N {\cos (n_j\theta)}$ tends
to $\infty$ as a function of $N$. Conrey's question in general does not appear
to be easy.Let ${\mathcal P}_n(S)$ be the set of all algebraic polynomials of
degree at most $n$ with each of their coefficients in $S$. For a finite set $S
\subset {\mathbb C}$ let $M = M(S) := \max\{|z|: z \in S\}$. It has been shown
recently that if $S \subset {\mathbb R}$ is a finite set and $(P_n)$ is a
sequence of self-reciprocal polynomials $P_n \in {\mathcal P}_n(S)$ with
$|P_n(1)|$ tending to $\infty$, then the number of zeros of $P_n$ on the unit
circle also tends to $\infty$. In this paper we show that if $S \subset
{\mathbb Z}$ is a finite set, then every self-reciprocal polynomial $P \in
{\mathcal P}_n(S)$ has at least $$c(\log\log\log|P(1)|)^{1-\varepsilon}-1$$
zeros on the unit circle of ${\mathbb C}$ with a constant $c > 0$ depending
only on $\varepsilon > 0$ and$M = M(S)$. Our new result improves the exponent
$1/2 - \varepsilon$ in a recent result by Julian Sahasrabudhe to $1 -
\varepsilon$. Sahasrabudhe's new idea [66] is combined with the approach used
in [34] offering an essencially simplified way to achieve our improvement. We
note that in both Sahasrabudhe's paper and our paper the assumption that the
finite set $S$ contains only integers is deeply exploited.

particle process, is a lattice-gas made of particles that hop symmetrically on
a discrete line respecting hard-core exclusion. The system is prepared on the
infinite lattice with a step initial profile with average densities $\rho_{+}$
and $\rho_{-}$ on the right and on the left of the origin. When $\rho_{+} =
\rho_{-}$, the gas is at equilibrium and undergoes stationary fluctuations.
When these densities are unequal, the gas is out of equilibrium and will remain
so forever. A tracer, or a tagged particle, is initially located at the
boundary between the two domains; its position $X_t$ is a random observable in
time, that carries information on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the whole
system. We derive an exact formula for the cumulant generating function and the
large deviation function of $X_t$, in the long time limit, and deduce the full
statistical properties of the tracer's position. The equilibrium fluctuations
of the tracer's position, when the density is uniform, are obtained as an
important special case.

geometrically scaled Single Edge Notch Bending (SENB) specimens with varying

the scaling.
  It is shown that, while the strength of the pristine polymer scales according
to Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), this is not the case for
nanocomposites, even for very low graphene contents. In fact, small specimens
exhibited a more pronounced ductility with limited scaling and a significant
deviation from LEFM whereas larger specimens behaved in a more brittle way,
with scaling of nominal strength closer to the one predicted by LEFM.
  This behavior, due to the significant size of the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ)
compared to the specimen size, needs to be taken into serious consideration. In
facts, it is shown that, for the specimen sizes investigated in this work,
neglecting the non-linear effects of the FPZ can lead to an underestimation of
the fracture energy as high as 113%, this error decreasing for increasing
specimen sizes.

novel Electro-Fluid-Mechanical Contraction (EFMC) model for dynamical
contractions, based on a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model for action potentials.
The one-dimensional model for a compliant lymphatic vessel is a set of
hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The EFMC model combines the
electrical activity of lymphangions (action potentials) with fluid-mechanical
feedback (stretch of the lymphatic wall and wall shear stress) and the
mechanical variation of the lymphatic wall properties (contractions). The EFMC
model is governed by four Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and
phenomenologically relies on: (1) environmental calcium influx, (2)
stretch-activated calcium influx, and (3) contraction inhibitions induced by
wall shear stresses. We carried out a complete mathematical analysis of the
stability of the stationary state of the EFMC model. Overall, the EFMC model
allows imitating the influence of pressure and wall shear stress on the
frequency of contractions observed experimentally. Lymphatic valves are
modelled using a well-established lumped-parameter model which allows
simulating stenotic and regurgitant valves. We analysed several lymphodynamical
indexes of a single lymphangion for a wide range of upstream and downstream
pressure combinations. Stenotic and regurgitant valves were modelled, and their
effects are here quantified. Results for stenotic valves showed in the
downstream lymphangion that for low frequencies of contractions the Calculated
Pump Flow (CPF) index remained almost unaltered, while for high frequencies the
CPF dramatically decreased depending on the severity of the stenosis (up to 93%
for a severe stenosis). Results for incompetent valves showed that the net flow
during a lymphatic cycle tends to zero as the degree of incompetence increases.

reliable statistics for important variables such as population, income,

extensively used to generate reliable statistics by ""borrowing strength"" from
other areas and related variables through suitable models. Outliers adversely
influence standard model-based small area estimates. To deal with outliers,
Sinha and Rao (2009) proposed a robust frequentist approach. In this article,
we present a robust Bayesian alternative to the nested error regression model
for unit-level data to mitigate outliers. We consider a two-component scale
mixture of normal distributions for the unit-level error to model outliers and
present a computational approach to produce Bayesian predictors of small area
means under a noninformative prior for model parameters. A real example and
extensive simulations convincingly show robustness of our Bayesian predictors
to outliers. Simulations comparison of these two procedures with Bayesian
predictors by Datta and Ghosh (1991) and M-quantile estimators by Chambers et
al. (2014) shows that our proposed procedure is better than the others in terms
of bias, variability, and coverage probability of prediction intervals, when
there are outliers. The superior frequentist performance of our procedure shows
its dual (Bayes and frequentist) dominance, and makes it attractive to all
practitioners, both Bayesian and frequentist, of small area estimation.

such as adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance. In this paper, we
propose an IEEE 802.11ad-based radar for long-range radar (LRR) applications at
the 60 GHz unlicensed band. We exploit the preamble of a single-carrier (SC)
physical layer (PHY) frame, which consists of Golay complementary sequences
with good correlation properties, as a radar waveform. This system enables a
joint waveform for automotive radar and a potential mmWave vehicular
communication system based on IEEE 802.11ad, allowing hardware reuse. To
formulate an integrated framework of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and
LRR based on a mmWave consumer wireless local area network (WLAN) standard, we
make typical assumptions for LRR applications and incorporate the full duplex
radar assumption due to the possibility of sufficient isolation and
self-interference cancellation. We develop single- and multi-frame radar
receiver algorithms for target detection as well as range and velocity
estimation within a coherent processing interval. Our proposed radar processing
algorithms leverage channel estimation and time-frequency synchronization
techniques used in a conventional IEEE 802.11ad receiver with minimal
modifications. Analysis and simulations show that in a single target scenario,
a Gbps data rate is achieved simultaneously with cm-level range accuracy and
cm/s-level velocity accuracy. The target vehicle is detected with a high
probability of detection ($>$99.9$\%$) at a low false alarm of 10$^{-6}$ for an
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 43 dBm up to a vehicle

highly anisotropic in-plane charge transport. Despite extensive study of the
steady-state charge transport in BP, there has not been direct characterization
and visualization of the hot carriers dynamics in BP immediately after
photoexcitation, which is crucial to understanding the performance of BP-based
optoelectronic devices. Here we use the newly developed scanning ultrafast

hot carriers on the surface of BP in both space and time. We observe highly
anisotropic in-plane diffusion of hot holes, with a 15-times higher diffusivity
along the armchair (x-) direction than that along the zigzag (y-) direction.
Our results provide direct evidence of anisotropic hot carrier transport in BP

multi-scale context modeling with deep feature learning, by taking semantic
image segmentation as an exemplar application. Prior neural networks, such as
ResNet, tend to enhance representational power by increasing the depth of
architectures and driving the training objective across layers. However, we
argue that spatial dependencies in different layers, which generally represent
the rich contexts among data elements, are also critical to building deep and
discriminative representations. To this end, our PDNs enables to progressively
broadcast information over the learned feature maps by inserting a stack of
information diffusion layers, each of which exploits multi-dimensional
convolutional LSTMs (Long-Short-Term Memory Structures). In each LSTM unit, a
special type of atrous filters are designed to capture the short range and long
range dependencies from various neighbors to a certain site of the feature map
and pass the accumulated information to the next layer. From the extensive
experiments on semantic image segmentation benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet Parsing,
PASCAL VOC2012 and PASCAL-Part), our framework demonstrates the effectiveness
to substantially improve the performances over the popular existing neural

LRC is said to be optimal if the minimum distance attains the Singleton-like
bound $d \le n-k-\lceil k/r \rceil +2$. The \emph{generalized Hamming weights}
(GHWs) of linear codes are fundamental parameters which have many useful
applications. Generally it is difficult to determine the GHWs of linear codes.
In this paper, we study the GHWs of LRCs. Firstly, we obtain a generalized
Singleton-like bound on the $i$-th $(1\le i \le k)$ GHWs of general $(n,k,r)$
LRCs. Then, it is shown that for an optimal $(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \mid k$, its

bound for all $1\le i \le k$. For an optimal $(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \nmid k$, we
give lower bounds on the GHWs of the LRC and its dual code. Finally, two
general bounds on linear codes in terms of the GHWs are presented. Moreover, it
is also shown that some previous results on the bounds of minimum distances of
linear codes can also be explained or refined in terms of the GHWs.

potentials has been well studied in the past. There are challenges in
simultaneously addressing some of the inherent issues of the system: The
functional operator cannot exist entirely within the standard $L^2$ Hilbert
spaces. On differentiable manifolds, the domain of the free kinetic energy
operator is in the space of harmonic forms. Locally, by the Hodge decomposition
theorem and the standard distributional calculus, the space of functionals of a
$\delta$ or $\delta'$ potential must be orthogonal to the free kinetic energy
operator. Restricting to semicontinuous topologies presents opportunities to
address these, and other issues. We develop, in great detail, a formalism of
Banach spaces with semicontinuous topologies, and their properties are
extensively defined and studied. For $C(\overline{\mathbb{R}})$ functions, the
spaces are indistinguishable. The semicontinuous analogs of the $L^p$ spaces,
are nontrivial and result in a dense topologically continuous embedding of the
semicontinuous $L^p$ spaces into the semicontinuous $C(\overline{\mathbb{R}})$
spaces. Here, certain classes of distributions may be inverted in terms of
their primitive functions. Also many operators are inherently self adjoint. We
define equivalence relations between the cohomology classes of distributions
and derivatives of their associated primitives on local sections of
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. Here Hamilton's equations are canonical, and define a
connection on the fibers of the base space. Semicontinuity provides a
resolution to the above domain and interaction problems, and easily integrable
Feynman functional. We arrive at a compatible domain which is Krein
($\mathfrak{H}$) over disjoint components of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. The
subspaces of $\mathfrak{H}$ are isomorphic to the semicontinuous Hilbert spaces

  Stability and Control","PhD thesis, Arizona State University, May 2016",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we focus on some of the NP-hard problems in control theory.
Thanks to the converse Lyapunov theory, these problems can often be modeled as
optimization over polynomials. To avoid the problem of intractability, we
establish a trade off between accuracy and complexity. We develop a sequence of
tractable optimization problems - in the form of LPs and SDPs - whose solutions
converge to the exact solution of the NP-hard problem. However, the
computational and memory complexity of these LPs and SDPs grow exponentially
with the progress of the sequence - meaning that improving the accuracy of the
solutions requires solving SDPs with tens of thousands of decision variables
and constraints. Setting up and solving such problems is a significant
challenge. The existing optimization algorithms and software are only designed
to use desktop computers or small cluster computers - machines which do not
have sufficient memory for solving such large SDPs. This in fact is the reason
we seek parallel algorithms for setting-up and solving large SDPs on
supercomputers.
  We propose parallel algorithms for stability analysis of two classes of
systems: 1) Linear systems with a large number of uncertain parameters; 2)
Nonlinear systems defined by polynomial vector fields. First, we develop a
distributed parallel algorithm which applies Polya's and Handelman's theorems
to some variants of parameter-dependent Lyapunov inequalities with parameters
defined over the simplex. The result is a sequence of SDPs which possess a
block-diagonal structure. We then develop a parallel SDP solver which exploits
this structure to map the computation, memory and communication to a
distributed parallel environment. Numerical tests on a supercomputer
demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to efficiently utilize hundreds and
potentially thousands of processors and analyze systems with 100+ dimensional
state-space.

An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts.
Despite many proposed methods to identify such subset, none are scalable enough
to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays billion-size networks.

model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of

the core of our methods is an $O(1)$-space out-of-core algorithm to generate a
new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (HSAWs). Such a
low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly,
hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive

higher quality solutions and are several order of magnitude faster than the

minimum in the skewed Li-HOSr geometry with $D_e=4932$ cm$^{-1}$ and saddle
points in collinear configurations. Our quantum scattering calculations predict
low spin relaxation rates in fully spin-polarized Li+SrOH collisions with the
ratios of elastic to inelastic collision rates well in excess of 100 over a
wide range of magnetic fields (1-1000 G) and collision energies
(10$^{-5}-0.1$~K) suggesting favorable prospects for sympathetic cooling of
SrOH molecules with spin-polarized Li atoms in a magnetic trap. We find that
spin relaxation in Li+SrOH collisions occurs via a direct mechanism mediated by
the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the electron spins of Li and
SrOH, and that the indirect (spin-rotation) mechanism is strongly suppressed.
The upper limit to the Li+SrOH reaction rate coefficient calculated for the
singlet PES using adiabatic capture theory is found to decrease from $4\times
10^{-10}$~cm$^3$/s to a limiting value of $3.5\times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/s with
decreasing temperature from 0.1 K to 1 $\mu$K.

models a quantity of interest as a nonlinear function of a few linear
combinations of the input parameters. When used in parameter studies (e.g.,
optimization or uncertainty quantification), ridge approximations allow the low
dimensional structure to be exploited, reducing the effective dimension. We
introduce a new, fast algorithm for constructing a ridge approximation where
the nonlinear function is a polynomial. This polynomial ridge approximation is
chosen to minimize least squared mismatch between the surrogate and the
quantity of interest on a given set of inputs. Naively, this would require
optimizing both the polynomial coefficients and the linear combination of
weights; the latter of which define a low-dimensional subspace of the input
space. However, given a fixed subspace the optimal polynomial can be found by
solving a linear least-squares problem, and hence by using variable projection
the polynomial can be implicitly found leaving an optimization problem over the
subspace alone. We provide an algorithm that finds this polynomial ridge
approximation by minimizing over the Grassmann manifold of low-dimensional
subspaces using a Gauss-Newton method. We provide details of this optimization
algorithm and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples. Our
Gauss-Newton method has superior theoretical guarantees and faster convergence

applications. Reflective and refractive metasurfaces are designed using the
generalized reflection and Snell's laws, which tell that local phase shifts at
the metasurface supply extra momentum to the wave, presumably allowing
arbitrary control of reflected or transmitted waves. However, as it has been
recently shown for the electromagnetic counterpart, conventional metasurfaces
based on the generalized laws of reflection and refraction have important
drawbacks in terms of power efficiency. This work presents a new synthesis
method of acoustic metasurfaces for anomalous reflection and transmission that
overcomes the fundamental limitations of conventional designs, allowing full
control of acoustic energy flow. The results show that different mechanisms are
necessary in the reflection and transmission scenarios for ensuring perfect
performance. Metasurfaces for anomalous reflection require non-local response,
which allows energy channeling along the metasurface. On other hand, for
perfect manipulation of anomalously transmitted waves, local and non-symmetric
response is required. These conclusions are interpreted through appropriate
surface impedance models which are used to find possible physical
implementations of perfect metasurfaces in each scenario. We hope that this
advance in the design of acoustic metasurfaces opens new avenues not only for
perfect anomalous reflection and transmission but also for realizing more

storage of the capacitance due to spin accumulation has not been fully
understood. Here, we resolve this problem starting from the charge storage in
the spin degree of freedom: spin accumulation manifests itself as an excess of
electrons in one spin channel and an equal deficiency in the other under the
quasi-neutrality condition. This enables us to model the two spin channels as
the two plates of a capacitor. Taking a ferromagnet/nonmagnet junction as an
example and using a method similar to that for treating quantum capacitance, we
find that a spin-accumulation (SA) capacitance can be introduced for each layer
to measure its ability to store spins. A spatial charge storage is not
essential for the SA capacitor and the energy stored in it is the splitting
energy of the spin-dependent chemical potentials instead of the electrostatic
energy. The SA capacitance is essentially a quantum capacitance due to spin
accumulation on the scale of the spin-diffusion length. The SA capacitances can
be used to reinterpret the imaginary part of the low-frequency

heterostructures far away from electron-hole equilibrium is measured. The
change of MR of such devices is found to be determined largely by a single
tunable parameter, i.e. the amount of imbalance between electrons and holes. We
also found that the magnetoresistive behavior of ultra-thin WTe2 devices is
well-captured by a two-fluid model. According to the model, the change of MR
could be as large as 400,000%, the largest potential change of MR among all
materials known, if the ultra-thin samples are tuned to neutrality when
preserving the mobility of 167,000 cm2V-1s-1 observed in bulk samples. Our
findings show the prospects of ultra-thin WTe2 as a variable magnetoresistance
material in future applications such as magnetic field sensors, information
storage and extraction devices, and galvanic isolators. The results also
provide important insight into the electronic structure and the origin of the
large MR in ultra-thin WTe2 samples.

density of one dimensional dataset, constructing an authentic possibly-gapped
histogram becomes rather complex. The candidate ensemble is described via a
two-layer Ising model, and its size is shown to grow exponentially. This
exponential complexity makes any exhaustive search in-feasible and all boundary
parameters local. For data compression via Uniformity, the decoding error
criterion is nearly independent of sample size. These characteristics nullify
statistical model selection techniques, such as Minimum Description Length
(MDL). Nonetheless practical and nearly optimal solutions are algorithmically
computable. A data-driven algorithm is devised to construct such histograms
along the branching hierarchy of a Hierarchical Clustering tree. Such resultant
histograms naturally manifest data's physical information contents:
deterministic structures of bin-boundaries coupled with stochastic structures
of Uniformity within each bin. Without enforcing unrealistic Normality and
constant variance assumptions, an application of possibly-gapped histogram is
devised, called analysis of Histogram (ANOHT), to replace Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA). Its potential applications are foreseen in digital re-normalization
schemes and associative pattern extraction among features of heterogeneous data
types. Thus constructing possibly-gapped histograms becomes a prerequisite for
knowledge discovery, via exploratory data analysis and unsupervised Machine

communications, is one promising technique to accommodate the exponentially
increasing mobile data traffic. While most previous works ignored user
mobility, there are some recent works taking it into account. However, the
duration of user contact times has been ignored, making it difficult to
explicitly characterize the effect of mobility. In this paper, we adopt the
alternating renewal process to model the duration of both the contact and
inter-contact times, and investigate how the caching performance is affected by
mobility. The data offloading ratio, i.e., the proportion of requested data
that can be delivered via D2D links, is taken as the performance metric. We
first approximate the distribution of the communication time for a given user
by beta distribution through moment matching. With this approximation, an
accurate expression of the data offloading ratio is derived. For the
homogeneous case where the average contact and inter-contact times of different
user pairs are identical, we prove that the data offloading ratio increases
with the user moving speed, assuming that the transmission rate remains the
same. Simulation results are provided to show the accuracy of the approximate
result, and also validate the effect of user mobility.

dynamics at high temperature, in one spatial dimension. In addition to the mass
density, pressure and particle velocity, a further quantity is needed, namely,
the degree of ionization. The system is supplemented by the first and second
law of thermodynamics and by an equation of state; all of them involve the
degree of ionization. At last, under the assumption of thermal equilibrium, the
system is closed by requiring Saha's ionization equation. The geometric
properties of the system are rather complicated: in particular, we prove the
loss of convexity (genuine nonlinearity) for both forward and backward
characteristic fields, and hence the loss of concavity of the physical entropy.
This takes place in a small bounded region, which we are able to characterize
by numerical estimates on the state functions. The structure of shock waves is
also studied by a detailed analysis of the Hugoniot locus, which will be used

the connection between the radiative damping process and the resonant linewidth

brightness distribution of the core and the extended halo was represented
relatively well with a single $\beta$-model of $\beta\sim0.5$ up to 15'-20'.
The X-ray spectra of the core was represented with a two-temperature model of
$kT\sim 0.9$ keV and $\sim0.6$ keV. The temperatures of the core and the halo
have a positive gradient in the center, and reach the maximum of $kT\sim1.0$

potential structure than that of the galaxy. The temperatures of the plume and

determining the abundances of $\alpha$-element separately, for the core, the

abundance of Fe was $\sim0.7$ in the core and in the plume, while that in the
tail was $\sim1.0$, but the difference was not significant considering the
uncertainties of the ICM. The abundance of the halo was almost the same up to
$r\sim10'$, and then it becomes significantly smaller (0.2-0.3) at

outer halo. From the surface brightness distribution, we estimated the gas mass

($\sim3\times10^{12}M_\odot$) in $r<100$~kpc. The gas mass to the dynamical

Network (SRN) generates attention maps for all labels and captures the
underlying relations between them via learnable convolutions. By aggregating
the regularized classification results with original results by a ResNet-101

thus requires no additional efforts on image annotations. Extensive evaluations
on 3 public datasets with different types of labels show that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts and has strong generalization
capability. Analysis of the learned SRN model demonstrates that it can
effectively capture both semantic and spatial relations of labels for improving

symbiotic binary stars and nova eruptions over the last decade or so based on
multiwavelength data. For example, symbiotic stars without shell burning on
their white dwarfs have been revealed through their X-ray emission, UV excess,
and UV variability. These purely accretion powered symbiotic stars have much
weaker optical emission lines than those with shell burning, and are therefore
harder to discover. Yet they may be as numerous as symbiotic stars with shell
burning. Interestingly, both types of symbiotic stars are capable of driving
strong outflows, leading to colliding wind X-ray emission and spatially
resolved jets. For nova eruptions, the most surprising discovery has been that
they are capable of particle acceleration as evidenced by Fermi detection of
novae as transient GeV gamma-ray sources. For nova eruptions in cataclysmic
variables, this implicates internal shocks, between a slow, dense outflow and a
fast outflow or wind. Other signatures of shocks include thermal X-rays and
non-thermal radio emissions, and a substantial fraction of optical emission may
be shock-powered in the early phase of novae. Radio (V959 Mon) and HST (V959
Mon and T Pyx) images of nova shells within a few years of their respective
eruptions suggest that the ejecta from a nova may commonly consist of an
equatorial ring and a bipolar outflow.

based on a generalization of the known Path-Greedy and Gap-Greedy spanners. The
$\delta$-Greedy spanner combines the most desirable properties of geometric
spanners both in theory and in practice. More specifically, it has the same
theoretical and practical properties as the Path-Greedy spanner: a natural
definition, small degree, linear number of edges, low weight, and strong
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for every $\varepsilon>0$. The $\delta$-Greedy
algorithm is an improvement over the Path-Greedy algorithm with respect to the
number of shortest path queries and hence with respect to its construction
time. We show how to construct such a spanner for a set of $n$ points in the
plane in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
  The $\delta$-Greedy spanner has an additional parameter, $\delta$, which
indicates how close it is to the Path-Greedy spanner on the account of the
number of shortest path queries. For $\delta = t$ the output spanner is
identical to the Path-Greedy spanner, while the number of shortest path queries
is, in practice, linear.
  Finally, we show that for a set of $n$ points placed independently at random

spanner gives the best results among the known spanners of expected $O(n \log

In particular, we aim at designing the precoding vectors solving the so-called
quality of service (QoS) and weighted max-min fairness (MMF) problems, assuming
that the channel state information is available at the base station (BS). To
solve both problems, the baseline approach exploits the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique. Considering a BS with $N$ antennas, the SDR complexity is more
than $\mathcal{O}(N^{6})$, which prevents its application in large-scale
antenna systems. To overcome this issue, we present two new classes of
algorithms that, not only have significantly lower computational complexity
than existing solutions, but also largely outperform the SDR based methods.
Moreover, we present a novel duality between transformed versions of the QoS
and the weighted MMF problems. The duality explicitly determines the solution
to the weighted MMF problem given the solution to the QoS problem, and vice
versa. Numerical results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions and to make comparisons with existing alternatives under different

the total unsigned line-of-sight photospheric magnetic flux in accompanying
extreme-ultraviolet arcades and dimmings. This tool was based on the analysis
of eruptions observed in 1996-2005 with SOHO/EIT and MDI. Empirical
relationships were obtained to estimate the probable importance of upcoming
space weather disturbances caused by an eruption, which just occurred, without
data on the associated coronal mass ejections. It was possible to estimate the
intensity of a non-recurrent geomagnetic storm (GMS) and Forbush decrease (FD),
as well as their onset and peak times. After 2010-2011, data on solar eruptions
are obtained with SDO/AIA and HMI. We use relatively short intervals of
overlapping EIT-AIA and MDI-HMI detailed observations and a number of large
eruptions over the next five years with the 12-hour cadence EIT images to adapt
the SOHO diagnostic tool to SDO data. The adopted brightness thresholds select
from the EIT 195 \AA\ and AIA 193 \AA\ image practically the same areas of
arcades and dimmings with a cross-calibration factor of 3.6-5.8 (5.0-8.2) for
the AIA exposure time of 2.0 s (2.9 s). For the same photospheric areas, the
MDI magnetic flux systematically exceeds the HMI flux by a factor of 1.4. Based
on these results, the empirical diagnostic relationships obtained from SOHO
data are adjusted to SDO instruments. Examples of a post-diagnostics based on
SDO data are presented. As before, the tool is applicable to non-recurrent GMSs
and FDs caused by nearly central eruptions from active regions, provided that
the southern component of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth is
predominantly negative, which is not predicted by this tool.

via shortest paths, while others have more explicit assumptions about how
routing (alternatively navigation or search) works or should work in real
networks. However, these assumptions are rarely checked against real data. Here
we directly analyze the structure of operational paths using real measurements.
For this purpose we use existing and newly created datasets having both the
topology of the network and a sufficient number of empirically-determined paths
over it. Such datasets are processed for air transportation networks, the human
brain, the Internet and the fit-fat-cat word ladder game. Our results suggest
that from the great number of possible paths, nature seems to pick according to
some simple rules, which we will refer to as routing policies. First we
confirm, that the preference of short paths is an inevitable policy element,
however the observed stretch of the paths suggests that there are other
policies at work simultaneously. We identify two additional policies common in
our networks: the ""conform hierarchy"", meaning that the paths should obey the
structural hierarchy of the network, and the ""prefer downstream"" policy which
promotes avoiding the network core if possible. Building upon these simple
policies, we propose a synthetic routing policy which can recover the basic
statistical properties of the operational paths in networks. Our results can be
helpful in estimating the reaction of complex systems for stress coming from
the outside more accurately than the shortest path assumption permits.

Burst Monitor (GBM), on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, suggest the
presence of a significant thermal spectral component, whose origin is not well
understood. Recently, it has been shown that for long duration GRBs, the
spectral width as defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the energies at
which the spectrum falls to half its peak value, lie in the range of 0.84-1.3
with a median value of 1.07. Thus, while most of the GRB spectra are found to
be too narrow to be explained by synchrotron emission from an electron
distribution, they are also significantly broader than a blackbody spectrum
whose width should be 0.54. Here, we consider the possibility that an intrinsic
thermal spectrum from a fire-ball like model, may be observed to be broadened
if the system undergoes a rapid temperature evolution. We construct a toy-model
to show that for bursts with durations in the range 5-70 seconds, the widths of
their 1 second time-averaged spectra can be at the most $\lesssim 0.557$. Thus,
while rapid temperature variation can broaden the detected spectral shape, the
observed median value of $\sim 1.07$ requires that there must be significant
sub-photospheric emission and/or an anisotropic explosion to explain the
broadening for most GRB spectra.

fulfils nonhomogeneous Neumann condition. If the Dirichlet condition is
prescribed only on a subset of the boundary, then the energy may be unbounded
from below over the set of admissible configurations, as shown by several
explicit conterexamples: in these cases the analysis of critical points is
addressed through an asymptotic development of the energy functional in a

show that critical points of the Foppl-von Karman energy can be strongly
approximated by uniform Palais-Smale sequences of suitable functionals: this
property leads to identify relevant features for critical points of
approximating functionals, e.g. buckled configurations of the plate. Eventually
we perform further analysis as the plate thickness tends to 0, by assuming that
the plate is prestressed and the energy functional depends only on the
transverse displacement around the given prestressed state: by this approach,
first we identify suitable exponents of plate thickness for load scaling, then
we show explicit asymptotic oscillating minimizers as a mechanism to relax
compressive states in an annular plate.

the Universe with about a hundred of light axion species which are decoupled
from the Standard Model particles. However, the axions can couple to the
inflaton which leads to their production after inflation. Then, these axions
remain in the expanding Universe contributing to the dark radiation component,
which is severely bounded from present cosmological data. We place a general
constraint on the axion production rate and apply it to several variants of
reasonable inflaton-to-axion couplings. The limit merely constrains the number
of ultralight axions and the relative strength of inflaton-to-axion coupling.
It is valid in both large and small field inflationary models irrespectively of
the axion energy scales and masses. Thus, the limit is complementary to those
associated with the Universe overclosure and axion isocurvature fluctuations.
In particular, a hundred of axions is forbidden if inflaton universally couples
to all the fields at reheating. In the case of gravitational sector being
responsible for the reheating of the Universe (which is a natural option in all
inflationary models with modified gravity), the axion production can be
efficient. We find that in the Starobinsky $R^2$-inflation even a single axion
(e.g. the standard QCD-axion) is in tension with the Planck data, making the
model inconsistent with the axiverse. The general conclusion is that an
inflation with inefficient reheating mechanism and low reheating temperature
may be in tension with the presence of light scalars.

Radioactive-Ion Beams (RIB) to measure reaction processes including exotic
nuclei. These measurements coupled with an accurate theoretical model of the
reaction enable us to infer information about the structure of these nuclei.
The partial-wave expansion provides a precise description of two-body
collisions but has a large computational cost. To cope with this issue, the
eikonal approximation is a powerful tool as it reduces the computational time
and still describes the quantum effects observed in reaction observables.
However, its range of validity is restricted to high energy and to forward
scattering angles. In this work, we analyse the extension of the eikonal
approximation to lower energies and larger angles through the implementation of
two corrections. These aim to improve the treatment of the nuclear and Coulomb
interactions within the eikonal model. The first correction is based on an
expansion of the $T$-matrix while the second relies on a semi-classical
approach. They permit to better account for the deflection of the projectile by
the target, which is neglected in the standard eikonal model. The gain in
accuracy of each correction is evaluated through the analyses of angular cross
sections computed with the standard eikonal model, its corrections and the
partial-wave expansion. These analyses have been performed for tightly bound
projectiles ($^{10}\mathrm{Be}$) from intermediate energies (67 MeV/nucleon)

Hence qualitative robustness of the statistical estimator under the bootstrap
approximation is a desirable property. Currently most theoretical
investigations on qualitative robustness assume independent and identically

not fulfilled. Therefore, we examine the qualitative robustness of bootstrap
approximations for non-i.i.d. random variables, for example $\alpha$-mixing and
weakly dependent processes. In the i.i.d. case qualitative robustness is
ensured via the continuity of the statistical operator, representing the
estimator, see Hampel (1971) and Cuevas and Romo (1993). We show, that
qualitative robustness of the bootstrap approximation is still ensured under

in the molecule, associated with the off-diagonal-in-spin component of the
conductance, is predicted. This spin accumulation becomes enhanced with
increasing the spin polarization of the leads, and it results in a nonmonotonic
dependence of the conductance on frequency, with local maxima occurring for
characteristic energy scales.

precise sequences of spikes directly in the neural simulation. In this scheme,
each neuron is assigned a randomized code that is used to tag the post-synaptic

address this issue in the framework of a lattice model for granular-like
velocity fields. For a quite general driving mechanism, including both boundary

long time limit is globally stable. This is done by proving analytically that a
certain $H$-functional is non-increasing in the long time limit. Moreover, for
two specific energy injection mechanisms, we are able to demonstrate that the
proposed $H$-functional is non-increasing for all times. Also, we put forward a
proof that clearly illustrates why the ""classical"" Boltzmann functional
$H_{B}[f]=\int\! d\mathbf{r} \, d\mathbf{v} f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v},t) \ln

edge-weighted network $G$ with $k$ terminal vertices, compress it into a
smaller network $H$ with the same terminals, such that every minimum terminal
cut in $H$ approximates the corresponding one in $G$, up to a factor $q\geq 1$
that is called the quality. (The case $q=1$ is known also as a mimicking
network). We provide new insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts,
leading to new results for cut sparsifiers of planar graphs. Our first
contribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which we call
elementary, that generates all the others. Consequently, $H$ is a cut
sparsifier if and only if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to
this factor $q$). This structural characterization lead to improved bounds on
the size of $H$. For example, it improve the bound of mimicking-network size
for planar graphs into a near-optimal one. Our second and main contribution is
to refine the known bounds in terms of $\gamma=\gamma(G)$, which is defined as
the minimum number of faces that are incident to all the terminals in a planar
graph $G$. We prove that the number of elementary terminal cuts is
$O((2k/\gamma)^{2\gamma})$ (compared to $O(2^k)$ terminal cuts), and
furthermore obtain a mimicking-network of size $O(\gamma 2^{2\gamma} k^4)$,
which is near-optimal as a function of $\gamma$. In the analysis we break the
elementary terminal cuts into fragments, and count them carefully. Our third
contribution is a duality between cut sparsification and distance
sparsification for certain planar graphs, when the sparsifier $H$ is required
to be a minor of $G$. This duality connects problems that were previously
studied separately, implying new results, new proofs of known results, and
equivalences between open gaps.

in the rotational ground-state lines of various simple molecules against
distant Galactic continuum sources have opened the possibility of studying the
chemistry of diffuse molecular clouds throughout the Milky Way. In order to
calculate abundances, the column densities of molecular and atomic hydrogen,
HI, must be known. We aim at determining the atomic hydrogen column densities
for diffuse clouds located on the sight lines toward a sample of prominent
high-mass star-forming regions that were intensely studied with the HIFI
instrument onboard Herschel. Based on Jansky Very Large Array data, we employ
the 21 cm HI absorption-line technique to construct profiles of the HI opacity
versus radial velocity toward our target sources. These profiles are combined
with lower resolution archival data of extended HI emission to calculate the HI
column densities of the individual clouds along the sight lines. We employ
Bayesian inference to estimate the uncertainties of the derived quantities. Our
study delivers reliable estimates of the atomic hydrogen column density for a
large number of diffuse molecular clouds at various Galactocentric distances.
Together with column densities of molecular hydrogen derived from its
surrogates observed with HIFI, the measurements can be used to characterize the
clouds and investigate the dependence of their chemistry on the molecular
fraction, for example.

optical quantum states by ON/OFF switching of the control signal in each stages

However, in general, such a desirable pulse shape has a complicated form, which
would be hard to generate in practice. In this paper, for a wide class of
linear quantum memory systems, we develop a method that reduces the complexity
of the input pulse shape of a single-photon while maintaining the perfect state
transfer. The key idea is twofold; (i) the control signal is allowed to vary
continuously in time to introduce an additional degree of freedom, and then
(ii) an optimal control problem is formulated to design a simple-formed input
pulse and the corresponding control signal. Numerical simulations are conducted
for Lambda-type atomic media and a networked atomic ensembles, to show the

from a statistical learning view. Originally motivated by pursuing a
theoretical understanding of the maximum correntropy criterion based regression
(MCCR), our study reveals that MCCR with a tending-to-zero scale parameter is
essentially modal regression. We show that nonparametric modal regression
problem can be approached via the classical empirical risk minimization. Some
efforts are then made to develop a framework for analyzing and implementing
modal regression. For instance, the modal regression function is described, the
modal regression risk is defined explicitly and its \textit{Bayes} rule is
characterized; for the sake of computational tractability, the surrogate modal
regression risk, which is termed as the generalization risk in our study, is
introduced. On the theoretical side, the excess modal regression risk, the
excess generalization risk, the function estimation error, and the relations
among the above three quantities are studied rigorously. It turns out that
under mild conditions, function estimation consistency and convergence may be
pursued in modal regression as in vanilla regression protocols, such as mean
regression, median regression, and quantile regression. However, it outperforms
these regression models in terms of robustness as shown in our study from a
re-descending M-estimation view. This coincides with and in return explains the
merits of MCCR on robustness. On the practical side, the implementation issues
of modal regression including the computational algorithm and the tuning
parameters selection are discussed. Numerical assessments on modal regression
are also conducted to verify our findings empirically.

warm inner component. While the former are likely massive analogues of the
Kuiper belt, the origin of the latter is still a matter of debate. In this work
we investigate whether the warm dust may be a signature of asteroid belt
analogues. In the scenario tested here the current two-belt architecture stems
from an originally extended protoplanetary disc, in which planets have opened a
gap separating it into the outer and inner discs which, after the gas
dispersal, experience a steady-state collisional decay. This idea is explored
with an analytic collisional evolution model for a sample of 225 debris discs
from a Spitzer/IRS catalogue that are likely to possess a two-component
structure. We find that the vast majority of systems (220 out of 225, or 98%)
are compatible with this scenario. For their progenitors, original
protoplanetary discs, we find an average surface density slope of
$-0.93\pm0.06$ and an average initial mass of
$\left(3.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\right)\times 10^{-3}$ solar masses, both of which are
in agreement with the values inferred from submillimetre surveys. However, dust
production by short-period comets and - more rarely - inward transport from the
outer belts may be viable, and not mutually excluding, alternatives to the
asteroid belt scenario. The remaining five discs (2% of the sample: HIP 11486,
HIP 23497, HIP 57971, HIP 85790, HIP 89770) harbour inner components that
appear inconsistent with dust production in an ""asteroid belt."" Warm dust in
these systems must either be replenished from cometary sources or represent an

instability.

processor $i, 0\leq i<p$, and processor $r, 0\leq r<p$ a root processor

$2^j$ different processors with roots $r_j$ as constructed by the algorithm.
The worst-case penalty is less than $\beta \sum_{i\neq r}m_i$ time steps. The
algorithms have attractive properties for implementing the operations for MPI

prototype implementations for the MPI_Gatherv and MPI_Scatterv collectives of

cluster. In order to structure the experimental evaluation we formulate new

the new algorithms can fulfill these performance expectations with a large
margin, and that standard implementations do not.

  overlap with arXiv:1603.00671",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To increase the spectral efficiency of wireless networks without requiring
full-duplex capability of user devices, a potential solution is the recently
proposed three-node full-duplex mode. To realize this potential, networks
employing three-node full-duplex transmissions must deal with self-interference
and user-to-user interference, which can be managed by frequency channel and
power allocation techniques. Whereas previous works investigated either
spectral efficient or fair mechanisms, a scheme that balances these two metrics
among users is investigated in this paper. This balancing scheme is based on a
new solution method of the multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the
weighted sum of the per-user spectral efficiency and the minimum spectral
efficiency among users. The mixed integer non-linear nature of this problem is
dealt by Lagrangian duality. Based on the proposed solution approach, a
low-complexity centralized algorithm is developed, which relies on large scale
fading measurements that can be advantageously implemented at the base station.
Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm increases the spectral
efficiency and fairness among users without the need of weighting the spectral
efficiency. An important conclusion is that managing user-to-user interference
by resource assignment and power control is crucial for ensuring spectral
efficient and fair operation of full-duplex networks.

due to the increased hydrodynamic drag of the surface material in our

that the denoising principle should be extended to explicitly promote

propose to jointly learn the data auto-encoders and the target classifiers.
First, in order to make the denoised features domain-invariant, we propose a
domain regularization that may be either a domain prediction loss or a maximum
mean discrepancy between the source and target data. The noise marginalization
in this case is reduced to solving the linear matrix system $AX=B$ which has a
closed-form solution. Second, in order to help the classification, we include a
class regularization term. Adding this component reduces the learning problem
to solving a Sylvester linear matrix equation $AX+BX=C$, for which an efficient
iterative procedure exists as well. We did an extensive study to assess how
these regularization terms improve the baseline performance in the three domain
adaptation scenarios and present experimental results on two image and one text

half-harmonic maps $\mathbf{Q}$ with arbitrary degree $m \geq 1$. Here we
explicitly determine the nullspace including the zero-energy resonances; in

determining thousands of protein structures even from micro-sized crystals.
They suffer from some limitations that have not been overcome, such as
radiation damage, the natural inability to crystallize of a number of proteins

star-forming region (NGC7000/IC5070), with the aim of finding and
characterizing its young stellar population. X-ray data from Chandra (four
pointings) and XMM-Newton (seven pointings) were reduced and source detection
was performed on each image. We complement the X-ray data with optical and
near-IR data from the IPHAS, UKIDSS, and 2MASS catalogs, and with other
published optical and Spitzer IR data. More than 700 X-ray sources are
detected, the majority of which have an optical/NIR counterpart. This allows to
identify young stars in different stages of formation. Less than 30% of X-ray
sources are identified with a previously known young star. We argue that most
X-ray sources with an optical/NIR counterpart, except perhaps for a few tens at
near-zero reddening, are likely candidate members of the star-forming region,
on the basis of both their optical/NIR magnitudes and colors, and of X-ray
properties like spectrum hardness or flux variations. They are characterized by
a wide range of extinction, and sometimes near-IR excesses, both of which
prevent derivation of accurate stellar parameters. The optical color-magnitude
diagram suggests ages between 1-10~Myrs. The X-ray members have a very complex
spatial distribution with some degree of subclustering, qualitatively similar
to that of previously known members. The distribution of X-ray sources relative
to IR-excess objects found with Spitzer is sometimes suggestive of sequential
star formation, especially near the Gulf of Mexico region, probably triggered
by the O5 star illuminating the whole region. Around this latter star no
enhancement in the young star density is found, in agreement with previous

studied the $h$-$b$-$\bar b$-$\gamma$ effective interaction terms arising out
of gauge invariant dimension six operators in a model independent setting, as a

two different new physics scenarios in the context of 14 TeV LHC and and a

with an integrated luminosity of $\sim 2000~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, which an $e^+e^-$

consisting of smaller structures, which themselves fragment into even smaller
and more compact stellar groupings. Their size distribution, covering a wide
range in length-scales, shows a power-law as expected from scale-free
processes. We explain this shape with a simple ""fragmentation and enrichment""
model. The hierarchical morphology of the complexes is confirmed by their
mass--size relation which can be represented by a power-law with a fractional
exponent, analogous to that determined for fractal molecular clouds. The
surface stellar density distribution of the complexes shows a log-normal shape
similar to that for supersonic non-gravitating turbulent gas. Between 50 and 65
per cent of the recently-formed stars, as well as about 90 per cent of the
young star clusters, are found inside the stellar complexes, located along the
spiral arms. We find an age-difference between young stars inside the complexes

timescale may relate to the minimum time for stellar evaporation, although we
cannot exclude the in situ formation of stars. As expected, star formation
preferentially occurs in spiral arms. Our findings reveal turbulent-driven
hierarchical star formation along the arms of a grand-design galaxy.

researchers to investigate different aspects of the phenomenon. Experimental
evidence showed that confirmatory information gets accepted even if containing
deliberately false claims while dissenting information is mainly ignored or
might even increase group polarization. It seems reasonable that, to address
misinformation problem properly, we have to understand the main determinants
behind content consumption and the emergence of narratives on online social
media. In this paper we address such a challenge by focusing on the discussion
around the Italian Constitutional Referendum by conducting a quantitative,
cross-platform analysis on both Facebook public pages and Twitter accounts. We
observe the spontaneous emergence of well-separated communities on both
platforms. Such a segregation is completely spontaneous, since no
categorization of contents was performed a priori. By exploring the dynamics
behind the discussion, we find that users tend to restrict their attention to a
specific set of Facebook pages/Twitter accounts. Finally, taking advantage of
automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis techniques, we are able to
identify the most controversial topics inside and across both platforms. We
measure the distance between how a certain topic is presented in the

interesting insights for the understanding of the evolution of the core
narratives behind different echo chambers and for the early detection of

the goal of capturing the complexity of some well-known problems in

them in polynomial time. No complete problem was known for CLS, and in previous
work, the problems ContractionMap, i.e., the problem of finding an approximate
fixpoint of a contraction map, and PLCP, i.e., the problem of solving a
P-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem, were identified as prime candidates.
  First, we present a new CLS-complete problem MetaMetricContractionMap, which
is closely related to the ContractionMap. Second, we introduce
EndOfPotentialLine, which captures aspects of PPAD and PLS directly via a
monotonic directed path, and show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via a
two-way reduction to EndOfMeteredLine. The latter was defined to keep track of
how far a vertex is on the PPAD path via a restricted potential function.
Third, we reduce PLCP to EndOfPotentialLine, thus making EndOfPotentialLine and
EndOfMeteredLine at least as likely to be hard for CLS as PLCP. This last
result leverages the monotonic structure of Lemke paths for PLCP problems,
making EndOfPotentialLine a likely candidate to capture the exact complexity of
PLCP; we note that the structure of Lemke-Howson paths for finding a Nash
equilibrium in a two-player game very directly motivated the definition of the
complexity class PPAD, which eventually ended up capturing this problem's
complexity exactly.

deduced from the mm/submm brightness spectra and the degree of circular
polarization synthesized at millimeter frequencies. We used the frequency bands
observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) as a
convenient reference. The magnetic field maps obtained describe the
longitudinal magnetic field at the effective formation heights of the relevant
wavelengths in the solar chromosphere. The comparison of the deduced and model
chromospheric magnetic fields at the spatial resolution of both the model and
current observations demonstrates a good correlation, but has a tendency to
underestimate the model field. The systematic discrepancy of about 10 percent
is probably due to averaging of the restored field over the heights
contributing to the radiation, weighted by the strength of the contribution. On
the whole, the method of probing the longitudinal component of the magnetic
field with free-free emission at mm/submm wavelengths is found to be applicable
to measurements of the weak quiet-Sun magnetic fields. However, successful
exploitation of this technique requires very accurate measurements of the
polarization properties (primary beam and receiver polarization response) of
the antennas, which will be the principal factor that determines the level to
which chromospheric magnetic fields can be measured. Consequently,
high-resolution and high-precision observations of circularly polarized

ten active regions (ARs) as they cross the solar disk using the Hinode Extreme
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). Confirming the results of Demoulin et
al. (2013, Sol. Phys. 283, 341), we find that for each AR there is an observed
long term evolution of the upflows which is largely due to the solar rotation
progressively changing the viewpoint of dominantly stationary upflows. From
this projection effect, we estimate the unprojected upflow velocity and its
inclination to the local vertical. AR upflows typically fan away from the AR
core by 40 deg. to near vertical for the following polarity. The span of
inclination angles is more spread for the leading polarity with flows angled
from -29 deg. (inclined towards the AR center) to 28 deg. (directed away from
the AR). In addition to the limb-to-limb apparent evolution, we identify an
intrinsic evolution of the upflows due to coronal activity which is AR
dependent. Further, line widths are correlated with Doppler velocities only for
the few ARs having the largest velocities. We conclude that for the line widths
to be affected by the solar rotation, the spatial gradient of the upflow
velocities must be large enough such that the line broadening exceeds the
thermal line width of Fe XII. Finally, we find that upflows occurring in pairs
or multiple pairs is a common feature of ARs observed by Hinode/EIS, with up to
four pairs present in AR 11575. This is important for constraining the upflow
driving mechanism as it implies that the mechanism is not a local one occurring
over a single polarity. AR upflows originating from reconnection along
quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) between over-pressure AR loops and neighboring
under-pressure loops is consistent with upflows occurring in pairs, unlike
other proposed mechanisms acting locally in one polarity.

qualitatively conclude that they have a potential dearth of stars with ages <1
Gyr instead of being dominated by stellar populations with ages >1Gyr.
Regarding the chemical evolution of our sample, the LSBG data appear to allow
for up to 30 % metal loss, but we cannot completely rule out the closed-box
model. Additionally, we find evidence that our galaxies retain up to about 3
times as much of their metals compared with dwarfs, consistent with metal
retention being related to galaxy mass. In conclusion, our data support the
view that LSBGs are probably just normal disk galaxies continuously extending
to the low end of surface brightness.

dependency graphs. The choice between these styles has been made according to

programs running on top of the databases. In this paper, we present a set of
novel algebraic laws (i.e. inequations) that connect these two styles of
specifications; the laws relate binary relations used in a specification based
on abstract executions, to those used in a specification based on dependency
graphs. We then show that this algebraic connection gives rise to so called
robustness criteria, conditions which ensures that a program running on top of
a weakly-consistent database does not exhibit anomalous behaviours due to this
weak consistency. These criteria make it easy to reason about programs running

  Gravitational Theory","7 pages","Universe 2017, 3, 10","10.3390/universe3010010",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  John Nash has proposed a new theory of gravity. We define a Nash-tensor equal
to the curvature tensor appearing in the Nash field equations for empty space,
and calculate its components for two cases. 1. A static, spherically symmetric
space, and 2. The expanding, homogeneous and isotropic space of the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe models. We find the
general, exact solution of the Nash field equations for empty space in the
static case. The line element turns out to represent the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter spacetime. Also we find the simplest non-trivial solution of the field
equations in the cosmological case, which gives the scale factor corresponding
to the de Sitter spacetime. Hence empty space in the Nash theory corresponds to
a space with Lorentz Invariant Vacuum Energy (LIVE) in the Einstein theory.
This suggests that dark energy may be superfluous according to the Nash theory.
We also consider a radiation filled universe model in an effort to find out how
energy and matter may be incorporated into the Nash theory. A tentative
interpretation of the Nash theory as a unified theory of gravity and
electromagnetism leads to a very simple form of the field equations in the
presence of matter. It should be noted, however, that the Nash theory is still
unfinished. A satifying way of including energy-momentum into the theory has
yet to be found.

accelerating universe in Bianchi V space time in the frame work of General
Relativity (GR). The matter field we have considered is of two non interacting
fluids i.e. the usual string fluid and dark energy (DE) fluid. In order to
represent the pressure anisotropy, the skewness parameters are introduced along
three different spatial directions. To achieve a physically realistic solutions
to the field equations, we have considered a scale factor, known as hybrid
scale factor, which is generated by a time varying deceleration parameter. This
simulates a cosmic transition from early deceleration to late time
acceleration. It is observed that the string fluid dominates the universe at
early deceleration phase but does not affect nature of cosmic dynamics
substantially at late phase where as, the DE fluid dominates the universe in
present time, which is in accordance with the observations results. Hence, we
analysed here the role of two fluids in the transitional phases of universe
with respect to time which depicts the reason behind the cosmic expansion and
DE. The role of DE with variable equation of state parameter (EoS), skewness
parameters also discussed along with physical and geometrical properties.

from the assumption that knowledge is based on concepts, and propose that each
concept about reality is affected by vagueness. This entails a paradox, which I
term Knowledge Paradox (KP): i.e. we need concepts to acquire knowledge about
the real world but each concept is a step away from reality. The KP provides a
unifying context for the sorites and the liar paradoxes. Any concept is viewed
as a sorites, i.e. it is impossible to set a boundary between what is, and what
is not, the entity to which the concept refers. Hence, any statement about
reality can be reduced to a liar, wherefrom the KP follows in its most general
form: -If I know, then I do not know-. The KP is self-referential but not
contradictory, as it can be referred to two levels of knowledge: -if I
know(epistemic), then I do not know(ontic)-, where the ontic level is made
unachievable by concept vagueness. Such an interpretation of scientific
knowledge provides an understanding of its dynamics. Concept proliferation
within theories produces periods of knowledge decay that are episodically
reversed by the formulation of new theories based on a smaller number of
synthetic concepts.

maximum-likelihood fits, has been extended to extract model-independent S-wave
amplitudes in three-body decays such as $D^+ \to h^+h^+h^-$. A full amplitude
analysis is done where the magnitudes and phases of the S-wave amplitudes are
anchored at a finite number of $m^2(h^+h^-)$ control points, and a cubic spline
is used to interpolate between these points. The amplitudes for P-wave and
D-wave intermediate states are modeled as spin-dependent Breit-Wigner
resonances. GooFit uses the Thrust library, with a CUDA backend for NVIDIA GPUs
and an OpenMP backend for threads with conventional CPUs. Performance on a
variety of platforms is compared. Executing on systems with GPUs is typically a
few hundred times faster than executing the same algorithm on a single CPU.
