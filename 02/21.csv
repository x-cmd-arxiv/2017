we study forcing sets (zero forcing sets) which induce a subgraph of $G$
without isolated vertices. Such a set is called a total forcing set, introduced
and first studied by Davila \cite{Davila}. The minimum cardinality of a total
forcing set in $G$ is the total forcing number of $G$, denoted $F_t(G)$. We
study basic properties of $F_t(G)$, relate $F_t(G)$ to various domination
parameters, and establish $NP$-completeness of the associated decision problem
for $F_t(G)$. We also prove that if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n \ge 3$
and maximum degree $\Delta$, then $F_t(G) \le ( \frac{\Delta}{\Delta +1} ) n$,
with equality if and only if $G$ is a complete graph $K_{\Delta + 1}$.

anticipated but never experimentally realized. Spin waves propagating in a thin
film of yttrium iron garnet (YIG), a magnetostrictive ferrimagnet with low spin

frequencies near twice the spin wave frequency. The observation of a
counter-propagating idler wave and a distinct pump threshold that increases
quadratically with frequency non-degeneracy are evidence of a nonlinear
parametric pumping process consistent with classical theory. This demonstration
of acoustic parametric pumping lays the groundwork for developing new
spintronic and microwave signal processing devices based on amplification and
manipulation of spin waves by efficient, spatially localized acoustic

the overall characteristics of o Ceti's flaring events with those which have
been observed towards other thin-shell Miras, and explore the implication of
these events with respect to the standard OH circumstellar-envelope model. The
role of binarity in the specific characteristics of o Ceti's flaring events is
also investigated. The flaring regions are found to be less than ~400$ +/- 40
mas (i.e., ~40 +/- 4$ AU) either side of o Ceti, with seemingly no preferential
location with respect to the direction to the companion Mira B. Contrary to the
usual expectation that the OH maser zone is located outside the H2O maser zone,
the coincidence of the H2O and OH maser velocities suggests that both emissions
arise at similar distances from the star. The OH flaring characteristics of
Mira are similar to those observed in various Mira variables before, supporting
the earlier results that the regions where the transient OH maser emission
occurs are different from the standard OH maser zone.

chains describing two coupled subsystems. It is defined as the rate at which
transitions in the downstream subsystem tend to increase the mutual information
between the two subsystems, and is bounded by the dissipation arising from
these transitions. Its physical interpretation, however, is unclear, although
it has been used as a metric for the sensing performance of the downstream

number of simple model systems, establishing when and how its behaviour is
distinct from the instantaneous mutual information between subsystems. In the
simplest case, the two are almost equivalent. In more complex steady-state
systems, the mutual information and the learning rate behave qualitatively
distinctly, with the learning rate clearly now reflecting the rate at which the
downstream system must update its information in response to changes in the
upstream system. It is not clear whether this quantity is the most natural
measure for sensor performance, and, indeed, we provide an example in which
optimising the learning rate over a region of parameter space of the downstream

low, some BSs may not have an UE to serve. Rather than going into sleep mode,
the idle BSs can help nearby UEs using joint transmission. To deal with
BS-to-BS interference, we propose using joint transmission with dummy symbols
where uplink BSs serving uplink UEs participate in the precoding. Since BSs are
not aware of the uplink symbols beforehand, any symbols with zero power can be
transmitted instead to null the BS-to-BS interference. Numerical results show
significant performance gains for uplink and downlink at low and medium

sequential decision making tasks wherein an agent interacts with an environment
and acquires feedback in the form of rewards sampled from it. Traditionally,
such algorithms make decisions, i.e., select actions to execute, at every
single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR), which
enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating
it. FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
which maintains an explicit policy estimate by enabling temporal abstractions
in the action space. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in
different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600

techniques, which enable spatial resolution in inertial mass sensing
experiments with nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), are tailored for use in
microwave resonant sensing, which is commonly employed in microfluidics. We
show that the use of higher-order modes of such sensors can provide electrical

modes are used. With the analytical and experimental framework presented here,
we can move beyond simple counting and achieve the sizing and imaging of

superior compared to that of terrestrial and laboratory jets. They manage to

be an indication of some exotic physics but mainly a reflection of the specific
environment these jets propagate through. The key property of this environment
is a rapid decline of density and pressure along the jet, which promotes its
rapid expansion. Such an expansion can suppress global instabilities, which
require communication across the jet, and hence ensure its survival over huge

reliability of the method, we used different sets of mock data extracted from
four numerical realizations of dark matter haloes. The models shared the same
density profile but differed in anisotropy profiles, covering a wide range of
possibilities, from constant to increasing and decreasing with radius. The
tests were done in two steps, first assuming that the mass profile of the dwarf

varying also the mass distribution. We used two kinds of data samples:
unrealistically large ones based on over 270 000 particles from the numerical
realizations and small ones matching the amount of data available for the
Fornax dwarf. For the large data samples we recover both the mass and the
anisotropy profiles with very high accuracy. For the realistically small ones
we also find a reasonably good agreement between the fitted and the input

a result of their oversensitivity to the available data. Our results therefore
provide convincing evidence in favour of the applicability of the Schwarzschild

parameterless way is required, for example in complex systems, because only the
elastic-scattering intensity as a function of the energy resolution is
required. This has been termed ""Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy"" (ESS). It is
based on the inflection points in the elastic-scattering intensity at the
energy-resolution value corresponding to the overall system relaxation-time. A
Constant wavelength (CW) option, more suitable for reactor sources, and the
time-of-flight (TOF) option, more suitable for spallation sources, have already
been proposed, and here we examine the concept of a third option based on
neutron spin-echo (NSE), called ESS-NSE. In principle, this consists of simply
measuring depolarisation at the relatively-intense elastic echo-condition, as a
function of resolution, with the basic set-up being similar to standard
spin-echo. In its basic set-up, ESS spin-echo can access 5 orders of magnitude
in time from nanoseconds to tens of picoseconds, reaching slower relaxation
processes than the CW and TOF options recently presented. However, spatial
focussing is important for the small sample-sizes of biological systems, so we
also explore how the fields may be shaped to enable a small neutron beam to be

computational effort. In this paper we present an upscaling methodology for
geothermal heat transport with fractures represented explicitly in the

equation for the temperature, and solved on a highly irregular coarse grid that
preserves the fracture heterogeneity. The upscaling is based on different
strategies for the advective term and the conductive term, respectively. The
coarse scale advective term is constructed from sums of fine scale fluxes,
whereas the coarse scale conductive term is constructed based on numerically

wetting liquid droplet, of equilibrium contact angle $\theta_{\rm e}$, confined
in a solid wedge geometry of opening angle $\beta$. We focus on a mostly
non-wetting regime, given by the condition $\theta_{\rm e} - \beta > 90^\circ$,
where the droplet forms a liquid barrel -- a closed shape of positive mean
curvature. Using a quasi-equilibrium assumption for the shape of the liquid-gas
interface, we compute the surface energy landscapes experienced by the liquid
upon translations along the symmetry plane of the wedge. Close to equilibrium,
our model is in good agreement with numerical calculations of the surface
energy minimisation subject to a constrained position of the centre of mass of
the liquid.
  Beyond the statics, we put forward a Lagrangian description for the droplet
dynamics. We focus on the the over-damped limit, where the driving capillary
force is balanced by the frictional forces arising from the bulk hydrodynamics,
the corner flow near the contact lines and the contact line friction. Our
results provide a theoretical framework to describe the motion of partially
wetting liquids in confinement, and can be used to gain further understanding
on the relative importance of dissipative processes that span from microscopic
to macroscopic length scales.

spectrally well-sampled observations in the Ca II 8542 Angstrom line obtained
from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) are reduced by a Principle Component
Analysis and subsequently used in the automated detection of PMJs using the
simple learning algorithm k-Nearest Neighbour. PMJ detections were verified
with co-temporal Ca H-line observations. A total of 453 tracked PMJ events were
found, or 4253 PMJs detections tallied over all timeframes and a detection rate
of 21 events per timestep. From these, an average length, width and lifetime of
640 km, 210 km and 90 s were obtained. The average PMJ Ca II 8542 Angstrom line
profile is characterized by enhanced inner wings, often in the form of one or
two distinct peaks, and a brighter line core as compared to the quiet Sun
average. Average blue and red peak positions were determined at -10.4 km/s and
+10.2 km/s offsets from the Ca II 8542 Angstrom line core. We found several
clusters of PMJ hotspots within the sunspot penumbra, where PMJ events occur in
the same general area repeatedly over time. Our results indicate smaller
average PMJs sizes and longer lifetimes compared to previously published

present-day mass, and age of the clusters, using GES data in combination with a
large set of homogenized literature measurements. We find a dependency with
both metallicity and mass, that is evident when fitting for the two parameters
simultaneously, but no significant dependency with age. We confirm that the
Mg-Al anti-correlation is not seen in all clusters, but disappears for the less
massive or most metal-rich ones. We also use our dataset to see whether a
normal anti-correlation would explain the low [Mg/$\alpha$] observed in some
extragalactic globular clusters, but find that none of the clusters in our

This paper presents label distribution learning forests (LDLFs) - a novel label
distribution learning algorithm based on differentiable decision trees, which
have several advantages: 1) Decision trees have the potential to model any
general form of label distributions by a mixture of leaf node predictions. 2)
The learning of differentiable decision trees can be combined with
representation learning. We define a distribution-based loss function for a
forest, enabling all the trees to be learned jointly, and show that an update
function for leaf node predictions, which guarantees a strict decrease of the
loss function, can be derived by variational bounding. The effectiveness of the
proposed LDLFs is verified on several LDL tasks and a computer vision
application, showing significant improvements to the state-of-the-art LDL

to an interesting parametric suppression of the oscillations. Different
features of the $\eta-$ dependence encode information about the structure (such

well-known and widely used technique in optical metrology. Spatial-frequency
multiplexing interferometry with several spatial-carriers having
non-overlapping spatial-spectra is also well known and productive in optical
metrology. In this paper we propose temporal-multiplexing phase-shifting
interferometry applied to profilometry. That is, instead of having
fringe-patterns with well separated spatial-spectra, we propose instead to
separate the fringe information in the temporal-spectra. In other words, we may
have overlapping spatial-spectra, but separated in the temporal-spectra by
frequency multiplexing. Using 1-camera and several fringe-projectors one
minimizes the object shadows and specular reflections from the digitizing
solid. Temporal multiplexing profilometry allows us to illuminate the object
from several projectors turned-on simultaneously. In previous phase-shifting
co-phased profilometry, the projectors were turned-on and off sequentially. As
seen in this work temporal-multiplexing allow us to demodulate the several
fringe-patterns without crosstalk from other simultaneously projected fringes.
This is entirely analogous to having several television stations broadcasting
simultaneously, each TV-transmitter having its own broadcasting frequency. A
given TV-receiver tunes into a single TV-station and filter-out all other
broadcasters. Following this analogy, each fringe-projector must have its own
temporal broadcasting frequency to remain well separated from all other
projectors in the time-spectra domain. In addition to the general theory
presented, we assess its feasibility with experimental results.

decisions for each data item. This model is too restrictive for most
partitioning problems, since data that is yet to arrive may render it
impossible to extend partial partitionings to the entire data set reasonably
well.
  In this work, we show that preemption might be a potential remedy. We
consider the problem of partitioning online sequences, where $p-1$ separators
need to be inserted into a sequence of integers that arrives online so as to
create $p$ contiguous partitions of similar weight. While without preemption no
algorithm with non-trivial competitive ratio is possible, if preemption is
allowed, i.e., inserted partition separators may be removed but not reinserted
again, then we show that constant competitive algorithms can be obtained. Our
contributions include:
  We first give a simple deterministic $2$-competitive preemptive algorithm for
arbitrary $p$ and arbitrary sequences. Our main contribution is the design of a
highly non-trivial partitioning scheme, which, under some natural conditions
and $p$ being a power of two, allows us to improve the competitiveness to
$1.68$. We also show that the competitiveness of deterministic (randomized)
algorithms is at least $\frac{4}{3}$ (resp. $\frac{6}{5}$).
  For $p=2$, the problem corresponds to the interesting special case of
preemptively guessing the center of a weighted request sequence. While
deterministic algorithms fail here, we provide a randomized $1.345$-competitive
algorithm for all-ones sequences and prove that this is optimal. For weighted

magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma is a subject of active debate for
decades. Recent space observations suggest that the reconnection rate can be
higher than the Hall-reconnection rate and turbulent dissipation is required.
In this paper, using particle-in-cell simulations, we present a case study of
how AR produced by Buneman instability accelerates magnetic reconnection. We
first show that the AR/drag produced by Buneman instability in a thin electron
current layer 1) can dissipate magnetic energy stored in the current layer
through dissipation of the kinetic energy of electron beams; 2) The
inhomogeneous drag caused by wave couplings spontaneously breaks the magnetic
field lines and causes impulsive fast non-Hall magnetic reconnection on
electron-scales with a mean rate reaching 0.6 $V_A$. We then show that a
Buneman instability driven by intense electron beams around the x-point in a 3D
magnetic reconnection significantly enhances the dissipation of the magnetic
energy. Electron-scale magnetic reconnections driven by the inhomogeneous drag
around the x-line enhances the reconnection electric field and the in-plane
perpendicular magnetic field. About 40\% of the released magnetic energy is
converted into the electron thermal energy by AR while 50\% is converted into
the kinetic energy of the electron beams through the acceleration by the
reconnection electric field. The enhanced magnetic energy dissipation is
balanced by a net Poynting flux in-flow. About 10\% of the released magnetic
energy is brought out by an enhanced Poynting flux out-flow. These results
suggest that AR with sufficient intensity and electron-scale inhomogeneity can
significantly accelerate magnetic reconnection.

metallicity-mass relation. We quantify the relationship between stellar halo
mass and bulge or black hole prominence using a sample of eighteen Milky
Way-mass galaxies with newly-available measurements of (or limits on) stellar
halo properties. There is an order of magnitude range in bulge mass, and two
orders of magnitude in black hole mass, at a given stellar halo mass (or,
equivalently, merger history). Galaxies with low mass bulges show a wide range
of quiet merger histories, implying formation mechanisms that do not require
intense merging activity. Galaxies with massive 'classical' bulges and central
black holes also show a wide range of merger histories. While three of these
galaxies have massive stellar halos consistent with a merger origin, two do not
- merging appears to have had little impact in making these two massive
'classical' bulges. Such galaxies may be ideal laboratories to study massive
bulge formation through pathways such as early gas-rich accretion, violent disk
instabilities or misaligned infall of gas throughout cosmic time.

unparalleled seeing of CANDELS to gather a large, mass-selected sample of
galaxies in the NIR (rest-frame optical to UV). Progenitors of present-day
massive galaxies are identified via an evolving cumulative number density
selection, which accounts for the effects of merging to correct for the
systematic biases introduced using a fixed cumulative number density selection,
and find progenitors grow in stellar mass by $\approx1.5~\mathrm{dex}$ since
$z=5$. Using stacking, we analyze the structural parameters of the progenitors
and find that most of the stellar mass content in the central regions was in
place by $z\sim2$, and while galaxies continue to assemble mass at all radii,
the outskirts experience the largest fractional increase in stellar mass.
However, we find evidence of significant stellar mass build up at
$r<3~\mathrm{kpc}$ beyond $z>4$ probing an era of significant mass assembly in
the interiors of present day massive galaxies. We also compare mass assembly
from progenitors in this study to the EAGLE simulation and find qualitatively
similar assembly with $z$ at $r<3~\mathrm{kpc}$. We identify $z\sim1.5$ as a
distinct epoch in the evolution of massive galaxies where progenitors
transitioned from growing in mass and size primarily through in-situ star
formation in disks to a period of efficient growth in $r_{e}$ consistent with
the minor merger scenario.

show that the star-forming ancestors of the faintest ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
(UFDs; ${\rm M}_{\rm V}$ $\sim -2$ or ${\rm M}_{\star}$ $\sim 10^{2}$ at $z=0$)
had ultra-violet (UV) luminosities of ${\rm M}_{\rm UV}$ $\sim -3$ to $-6$
during reionization ($z\sim6-10$). The existence of such faint galaxies has
substantial implications for early epochs of galaxy formation and reionization.
If the faint-end slopes of the UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) during
reionization are steep ($\alpha\lesssim-2$) to ${\rm M}_{\rm UV}$ $\sim -3$,
then: (i) the ancestors of UFDs produced $>50$% of UV flux from galaxies; (ii)
galaxies can maintain reionization with escape fractions that are $>$2 times
lower than currently-adopted values; (iii) direct HST and JWST observations may
detect only $\sim10-50$% of the UV light from galaxies; (iv) the cosmic star
formation history increases by $\gtrsim4-6$ at $z\gtrsim6$. Significant flux
from UFDs, and resultant tensions with LG dwarf galaxy counts, are reduced if
the high-redshift UVLF turns over. Independent of the UVLF shape, the existence
of a large population of UFDs requires a non-zero luminosity function to ${\rm

paradox may arise in the process of black hole evaporation. Schwarzschild black
holes can support a non-trivial Wilson-line-type field, the integral of the
2-form around their horizon. After such an 'axionic black hole' evaporates, the
Wilson line must be supported by the corresponding 3-form field strength in the
region formerly occupied by the black hole. In the limit of small axion
decay-constant f, the energy required for this field configuration is too
large. The natural resolution is through the presence of light strings, which
allow the black hole to ""shed"" its axionic hair sufficiently early. This gives
rise to a new Weak-Gravity-type argument in the 2-form context: Small coupling,
in this case f, enforces the presence of light strings or a low cutoff. We also
discuss how this argument may be modified in situations where the weak coupling
regime is achieved in the low-energy effective theory through an appropriate
gauging of a model with a vector field and two 2-forms.

another, consistent with coming from the same point in the sky. Such a triplet
is expected once every 13.7 years as a random coincidence of background events.
However, considering the lifetime of the follow-up program the probability of
detecting at least one triplet from atmospheric background is 32%. Follow-up
observatories were notified in order to search for an electromagnetic
counterpart. Observations were obtained by Swift's X-ray telescope, by ASAS-SN,
LCO and MASTER at optical wavelengths, and by VERITAS in the very-high-energy
gamma-ray regime. Moreover, the Swift BAT serendipitously observed the location
100 s after the first neutrino was detected, and data from the Fermi LAT and
HAWC observatory were analyzed. We present details of the neutrino triplet and
the follow-up observations. No likely electromagnetic counterpart was detected,
and we discuss the implications of these constraints on candidate neutrino
sources such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae and active galactic

  Astronomical Society, 8 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stx433",,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many physical theories beyond the Standard Model predict time variations of
basic physics parameters. Direct measurement of the time variations of these
parameters is very difficult or impossible to achieve. By contrast,
measurements of fundamental constants are relatively easy to achieve, both in
the laboratory and by astronomical spectra of atoms and molecules in the early
universe. In this work measurements of the proton to electron mass ratio $\mu$
and the fine structure constant $\alpha$ are combined to place mildly model
dependent limits on the fractional variation of the Quantum Chromodynamic Scale
and the sum of the fractional variations of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value
and the Yukawa couplings on time scales of more than half the age of the
universe. The addition of another model parameter allows the fractional
variation of the Higgs VEV and the Yukawa couplings to be computed separately.
Limits on their variation are found at the level of less than $5 \times
10^{-5}$ over the past seven gigayears. A model dependent relation between the
expected fractional variation of $\alpha$ relative to $\mu$ tightens the limits
to $10^{-7}$ over the same time span. Limits on the present day rate of change
of the constants and parameters are then calculated using slow roll
quintessence. A primary result of this work is that studies of the
dimensionless fundamental constants such as $\alpha$ and $\mu$, whose values

simulations of supersonic, turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas with a
range of magnetic mean-field strengths characterized by the Alfv\'enic Mach

parsec to a few AU scales. In our simulations with the turbulent kinetic energy
density dominating over magnetic pressure ($\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}>1$), we
find that the collapse is approximately isotropic with $B\propto\rho^{2/3}$,
core properties are similar regardless of initial mean-field strength, and the
field direction on $100$ AU scales is uncorrelated with the mean field.
However, in the case of a dominant large-scale magnetic field
($\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}=0.35$), the collapse is anisotropic with
$B\propto\rho^{1/2}$. This transition at $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}\sim1$ is not
expected to be sharp, but clearly signifies two different paths for magnetic
field evolution in star formation. Based on observations of different star
forming regions, we conclude that star formation in the interstellar medium may
occur in both regimes. Magnetic field correlation with the mean-field extends
to smaller scales as $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}$ decreases, making future ALMA
observations useful for constraining $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm A}, 0}$ of the

magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of galaxies in the intracluster
medium (ICM). Although the magnetic pressure in typical clusters is not strong
enough to affect the gas mass loss rate from galaxies, magnetic fields can
affect the morphology of stripped galaxies. ICM magnetic fields are draped
around orbiting galaxies and aligned with their stripped tails. Magnetic fields
suppress shear instabilities at the galaxy-ICM interface, and magnetized tails
are smoother and narrower than tails in comparable hydrodynamic simulations in
Vijayaraghavan & Ricker (2015). Orbiting galaxies stretch and amplify ICM
magnetic fields, amplifying magnetic power spectra on $10 - 100$ kpc scales.
Galaxies inject turbulent kinetic energy into the ICM via their turbulent wakes
and $g$-waves. The magnetic energy and kinetic energy in the ICM increase up to
$1.5 - 2$ Gyr of evolution, after which galaxies are stripped of most of their
gas, and do not have sufficiently large gaseous cross sections to further
amplify magnetic fields and inject turbulent kinetic energy. The increase in
turbulent pressure due to galaxy stripping and generation of $g$-waves results
in an increase in the turbulent volume fraction of the ICM. This turbulent
kinetic energy is not a significant contributor to the overall ICM energy
budget, but greatly impacts the evolution of the ICM magnetic field.
Additionally, the effect of galaxies on magnetic fields can potentially be
observed in high resolution Faraday rotation measure (RM) maps as small scale
fluctuations in the RM structure.

qubit we wish to cool. We show that if the initial state of the probe falls
within a suitable range, and the free evolution of the probe is both unital and
conserves the excitation in the $z$-direction, then the cooling protocol will
always succeed, with an efficiency that depends on the rate of spin dephasing
and the swap gate fidelity. Furthermore, measuring the probe after it has
cooled many qubits provides an estimate of their temperature. We provide a
specific example where the probe is a Heisenberg spin chain, and suggest a
physical implementation using electronic spins in diamond. Here the probe is
constituted of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, while the thermal qubits are dark
spins. By using a novel pulse sequence, a chain of NV centers can be made to
evolve according to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. This proposal allows for a range
of applications, such as NV-based nuclear magnetic resonance of photosensitive
molecules kept in a dark spot on a sample, and it opens up possibilities for
the study of quantum thermodynamics, environment-assisted sensing, and

that these structures ""maybe a misinterpretation of the data"". These claims are
in stark contrast to previous works. Motivated by this and other recent

conclusions need to have a statistical basis including a determination of the
significance of satellite alignments, observational biases must not be ignored,

discuss general problems faced by attempts to determine the dynamical stability
of the DoS via orbit integrations of MW satellite galaxies, and demonstrate
that to interpret simulations, it is helpful to compare them with a null case
of isotropically distributed satellite positions and velocities. Based on these
criteria, we find that the conclusions of Maji et al. do not hold up to
scrutiny, and that their hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of a single host

existing selection methods, while the remaining 70 per cent represent a
potential previously-unidentified population of candidate AGN that are missed
by mid-infrared colour cuts. Additionally, by relying on a radio continuum
detection, this technique is efficient at detecting radio-loud AGN at z > 0.29,
regardless of their level of dust obscuration or their host galaxy's relative

workflows. In recent years, rapid advances in artificial intelligence and
machine learning have led to an explosion of feature extraction tools and
services that allow data scientists to cheaply and effectively annotate their
data along a vast array of dimensions---ranging from detecting faces in images
to analyzing the sentiment expressed in coherent text. Unfortunately, the
proliferation of powerful feature extraction services has been mirrored by a
corresponding expansion in the number of distinct interfaces to feature
extraction services. In a world where nearly every new service has its own API,
documentation, and/or client library, data scientists who need to combine
diverse features obtained from multiple sources are often forced to write and
maintain ever more elaborate feature extraction pipelines. To address this
challenge, we introduce a new open-source framework for comprehensive
multimodal feature extraction. Pliers is an open-source Python package that
supports standardized annotation of diverse data types (video, images, audio,
and text), and is expressly with both ease-of-use and extensibility in mind.
Users can apply a wide range of pre-existing feature extraction tools to their
data in just a few lines of Python code, and can also easily add their own
custom extractors by writing modular classes. A graph-based API enables rapid
development of complex feature extraction pipelines that output results in a
single, standardized format. We describe the package's architecture, detail its
major advantages over previous feature extraction toolboxes, and use a sample
application to a large functional MRI dataset to illustrate how pliers can
significantly reduce the time and effort required to construct sophisticated
feature extraction workflows while increasing code clarity and maintainability.

the strong signal attenuation at these frequencies, thus demanding precise beam
alignment between transmitter and receiver. The communication overhead incurred
to achieve beam alignment may become a severe impairment in mobile networks.
This paper addresses the problem of optimizing beam alignment acquisition, with
the goal of maximizing throughput. Specifically, the algorithm jointly
determines the portion of time devoted to beam alignment acquisition, as well
as, within this portion of time, the optimal beam search parameters, using the
framework of Markov decision processes. It is proved that a bisection search
algorithm is optimal, and that it outperforms exhaustive and iterative search
algorithms proposed in the literature. The duration of the beam alignment phase
is optimized so as to maximize the overall throughput. The numerical results
show that the throughput, optimized with respect to the duration of the beam
alignment phase, achievable under the exhaustive algorithm is 88.3% lower than
that achievable under the bisection algorithm. Similarly, the throughput
achievable by the iterative search algorithm for a division factor of 4 and 8
is, respectively, 12.8% and 36.4% lower than that achievable by the bisection
algorithm.

network of interdependent queues. In this article we introduce methods for
analyzing a special class of networks of finite capacity queues, where tasks
arrive from an exogenous source, join the queue if there is an available server
or are rejected and move to another queue in search of service according to the
network topology. Such networks can be useful for modeling curbside parking
since queues in the network perform the same function and drivers searching for
an available server are under combinatorial constraints and jockeying is not
instantaneous. Further, we provide a motivating example for such networks of
finite capacity queues in the context of drivers searching for parking in the
neighborhood of Belltown in Seattle, Washington, USA. Lastly, since the
stationary distribution of such networks used to model parking are difficult to
satisfactorily characterize, we also introduce a simulation tool for the
purpose of testing the assumptions made to estimate interesting performance
metrics. Our results suggest that a Markovian relaxation of the problem when
solving for the mean rate metrics is comparable to deterministic service times
reflective of a driver's tendency to park for the maximum allowable time.

  We present DEEProtect, a framework that enables a novel form of inference

DEEProtect adopts a two-layered privacy strategy. First, it leverages novel

representation of sensor data consisting only of features relevant to
authorized utility-providing inferences. Second, DEEProtect obfuscates the

as a novel relaxed notion of local differential privacy that enhances utility.
Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments using real-world

provides provable privacy guarantees with up to 8x improvement in utility.
Finally, DEEProtect shares obfuscated but raw sensor data reconstructed from
the perturbed features, thus requiring no changes to the existing app

using a combination of numerical simulations and theory. We consider six models
distinguished by binary separation, secondary mass and outflow mechanisms. Each
system consists of an asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star and an accreting
secondary. The AGB star loses its mass via a wind. In one of our six models,
the AGB star incurs a short period of outburst. In all cases, the secondary
accretes part of the ejected mass and also influences the mass-loss rate of the
AGB star. The ejected mass may remain gravitationally bound to the binary
system and form a circumbinary disk, or contribute to an accretion disk around
the secondary. In other cases, the ejecta will escape the binary system. The
accretion rate on to the secondary changes non-linearly with binary separation.
In our closest binary simulations, our models exemplify the wind Roche lobe
overflow while in our wide binary cases, the mass transfer exhibits Bondi-Hoyle
accretion. The morphologies of the outflows in the binary systems are varied.
The variety may provide clues to how the late AGB phase influences planetary
nebulae shaping. We employ the adaptive-mesh-refinement code ASTROBEAR for our

formation. To attain the highest computational efficiency and the most stable

between 175 eV and 2.8 keV are shot across liquid water. Apart from
translational, rotational and vibrational excitation, they produce water
dissociation. The most abundant products are H and OH fragments. We find that
the maximum spatial production of radiolysis products, not only occurs at low
velocities, but also well below the maximum of energy deposition, reaching one
H every 5 Ang at the lowest speed studied (1 Bohr/fs), dissociative collisions
being more significant at low velocity while the amount of energy required to
dissociate water is constant and much smaller than the projectile's energy. A
substantial fraction of the energy transferred to fragments, especially for
high velocity projectiles, is in the form of kinetic energy, such fragments
becoming secondary projectiles themselves. High velocity projectiles give rise
to well-defined binary collisions, which should be amenable to binary
approximations. This is not the case for lower velocities, where multiple
collision events are observed. H secondary projectiles tend to move as radicals
at high velocity, as cations when slower. We observe the generation of new
species such as hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. The former occurs when an O
radical created in the collision process attacks a water molecule at the O
site. The latter when the C projectile is completely stopped and reacts with
two water molecules.

protocols that use logical clocks to control whether forced checkpoints must be
taken. Efficiency of these protocols is measured by how many forced checkpoints

fewer forced checkpoints the better. For many years, HMNR, also called Fully
Informed (FI), was the most complex and efficient protocol of this family. The
Lazy-FI protocol applies a lazy strategy that defers the increase of logical
clocks, resulting in a protocol with better efficiency for distributed systems
where processes can take basic checkpoints at different rates. Recently, the
Fully Informed aNd Efficient (FINE) protocol was proposed using the same
control structures as FI, but with a stronger and, presumably better,
checkpoint-inducing condition. FINE and its lazy version, called Lazy-FINE,
would now be the most efficient checkpointing protocols based on logical
clocks. This paper reviews this family of protocols, proves a theorem on a
condition that must be enforced by all stronger versions of FI, and proves that
both FINE and Lazy-FINE do not guarantee the absence of useless checkpoints. As
a consequence, FI and Lazy-FI can be rolled back to the position of most
efficient protocols of this family of index-based checkpointing protocols.

Galactic neighbourhood. We use the large spectroscopic survey RAVE and the
Geneva Copenhagen Survey. We compare the metallicity distribution of regions in
the velocity plane ($v_R,v_\phi$) with that of their symmetric counterparts
($-v_R,v_\phi$). We expect similar metallicity distributions if there are no
tracers of a sub-population (e.g., a dispersed cluster, accreted stars), if the
disk of the Galaxy is axisymmetric, and if the orbital effects of the spiral
arms and the bar are weak. We find that the metallicity-velocity space of the
solar neighbourhood is highly patterned. A large fraction of the velocity plane
shows differences in the metallicity distribution when comparing symmetric
$v_R$ regions. The typical differences in the median metallicity are of $0.05$
dex with a statistical significance of at least $95\%$, and with values up to
$0.6$ dex. For low azimuthal velocity $v_\phi$, stars moving outwards in the
Galaxy have on average higher metallicity than those moving inwards. These
include stars in the Hercules and Hyades moving groups and other velocity
branch-like structures. For higher $v_\phi$, the stars moving inwards have
higher metallicity than those moving outwards. The most likely interpretation
of the metallicity asymmetry is that it is due to the orbital effects of the
bar and the radial metallicity gradient of the disk. We present a simulation
that supports this idea. We have also discovered a positive gradient in
$v_\phi$ with respect to metallicity at high metallicities, apart from the two
known positive and negative gradients for the thick and thin disks,
respectively.

  complexity barriers via nonconvex optimization",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IT math.FA math.IT math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper concerns the problem of recovering an unknown but structured
signal $x \in R^n$ from $m$ quadratic measurements of the form
$y_r=|<a_r,x>|^2$ for $r=1,2,...,m$. We focus on the under-determined setting
where the number of measurements is significantly smaller than the dimension of
the signal ($m<<n$). We formulate the recovery problem as a nonconvex
optimization problem where prior structural information about the signal is
enforced through constrains on the optimization variables. We prove that
projected gradient descent, when initialized in a neighborhood of the desired
signal, converges to the unknown signal at a linear rate. These results hold
for any constraint set (convex or nonconvex) providing convergence guarantees
to the global optimum even when the objective function and constraint set is
nonconvex. Furthermore, these results hold with a number of measurements that
is only a constant factor away from the minimal number of measurements required
to uniquely identify the unknown signal. Our results provide the first provably
tractable algorithm for this data-poor regime, breaking local sample complexity
barriers that have emerged in recent literature. In a companion paper we
demonstrate favorable properties for the optimization problem that may enable
similar results to continue to hold more globally (over the entire ambient
space). Collectively these two papers utilize and develop powerful tools for
uniform convergence of empirical processes that may have broader implications
for rigorous understanding of constrained nonconvex optimization heuristics.
The mathematical results in this paper also pave the way for a new generation
of data-driven phase-less imaging systems that can utilize prior information to
significantly reduce acquisition time and enhance image reconstruction,
enabling nano-scale imaging at unprecedented speeds and resolutions.

and the solar magnetic fields, there was an expectation that the magnetic field
direction would rotate dramatically across the heliopause (HP). However, the
Voyager 1 spacecraft measured very little rotation across the HP. Previously we
showed that the $B_{ISM}$ twists as it approaches the HP and acquires a strong
T component (East-West). Here we establish that reconnection in the eastern
flank of the heliosphere is responsible for the twist. On the eastern flank the
solar magnetic field has twisted into the positive N direction and reconnects
with the Southward pointing component of the $B_{ISM}$. Reconnection drives a
rotational discontinuity (RD) that twists the $B_{ISM}$ into the -T direction
and propagates upstream in the interstellar medium towards the nose. The
consequence is that the N component of $B_{ISM}$ is reduced in a finite width
band upstream of the HP. Voyager 1 currently measures angles
($\delta=sin^{-1}(B_{N}/B)$) close to solar values. We present MHD simulations
to support this scenario, suppressing reconnection in the nose region while
allowing it in the flanks, consistent with recent ideas about reconnection
suppression from diamagnetic drifts. The jump in plasma $\beta$ (the plasma to
magnetic pressure) across the nose of HP is much greater than in the flanks
because the heliosheath $\beta$ is greater there than in the flanks.
Large-scale reconnection is therefore suppressed in the nose but not at the
flanks. Simulation data suggest that $B_{ISM}$ will return to its pristine
value $10-15~AU$ past the HP.

brighter than $0.2L^{\star}_{{\rm H}\alpha}(z)$ host a significant fraction

that the threshold of each observer remains constant throughout the observing

solar activity predicted by other recent reconstructions applying linear

formulated much like the classical studentized tests only after the initial
bias of estimation is removed successfully. The theory of debiased estimators
can be developed in the context of quantile regression models for a fixed
quantile value. However, it is frequently desirable to formulate tests based on
the quantile regression process, as this leads to more robust tests and more
stable confidence sets. Additionally, inference in quantile regression requires
estimation of the so called sparsity function, which depends on the unknown
density of the error. In this paper we consider a debiasing approach for the
uniform testing problem. We develop high-dimensional regression rank scores and
show how to use them to estimate the sparsity function, as well as how to adapt
them for inference involving the quantile regression process. Furthermore, we
develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in a location-shift high-dimensional models
and confidence sets that are uniformly valid for many quantile values. The main
technical result are the development of a Bahadur representation of the
debiasing estimator that is uniform over a range of quantiles and uniform
convergence of the quantile process to the Brownian bridge process, which are
of independent interest. Simulation studies illustrate finite sample properties

their exceptionally long coherence times and compatibility with the silicon

scalability, recent experiments have utilized gradient magnetic fields from
integrated micro-magnets to produce an extrinsic coupling between spin and

spins in silicon QDs experience a complex interplay between spin, charge, and
valley degrees of freedom, influenced by the atomic scale details of the

dependent anisotropic spin splitting in a Si QD with an integrated micro-magnet
and an external magnetic field. We show by atomistic calculations that the
spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which is often ignored in bulk silicon, plays a
major role in the measured anisotropy. Moreover, inhomogeneities such as
interface steps strongly affect the spin splittings and their valley
dependence. This atomic-scale understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic
factors controlling the valley dependent spin properties is a key requirement
for successful manipulation of quantum information in Si QDs.

in ubiquitous computing. Most approaches use a fixed size sliding window over
consecutive samples to extract features---either handcrafted or learned
features---and predict a single label for all samples in the window. Two key
problems emanate from this approach: i) the samples in one window may not
always share the same label. Consequently, using one label for all samples
within a window inevitably lead to loss of information; ii) the testing phase
is constrained by the window size selected during training while the best
window size is difficult to tune in practice. We propose an efficient algorithm
that can predict the label of each sample, which we call dense labeling, in a
sequence of human activities of arbitrary length using a fully convolutional
network. In particular, our approach overcomes the problems posed by the
sliding window step. Additionally, our algorithm learns both the features and
classifier automatically. We release a new daily activity dataset based on a
wearable sensor with hospitalized patients. We conduct extensive experiments
and demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to outperform the
state-of-the-arts in terms of classification and label misalignment measures on
three challenging datasets: Opportunity, Hand Gesture, and our new dataset.

antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The frustrated topology, which originates
in the pentagons of the fullerenes and is enhanced by their close proximity,
leads to a significant number of classical magnetization and susceptibility
discontinuities, something not expected for a model lacking magnetic
anisotropy. This establishes the classical discontinuities as a generic feature
of fullerene molecules irrespective of their symmetry. The largest number of
discontinuities have the molecule with 26 sites, four of the magnetization and
two of the susceptibility, and an isomer with 34 sites, which has three each.
In addition, for several of the fullerenes the classical zero-field lowest
energy configuration has finite magnetization, which is unexpected for
antiferromagnetic interactions between an even number of spins and with each
spin having the same number of nearest-neighbors. The molecules come in
different symmetries and topologies and there are only a few patterns of
magnetic behavior that can be detected from such a small sample of relatively
small fullerenes. Contrary to the classical case, in the full quantum limit
$s=\frac{1}{2}$ there are no discontinuities for a subset of the molecules that
was considered. This leaves the icosahedral symmetry fullerenes as the only
ones known supporting ground-state magnetization discontinuities for

The target follows a linear dynamics corrupted by an adversarial noise, i.e.,
the noise is not generated from a statistical distribution. The location of the
target at each time induces a global time-varying loss function, and the global
loss is a sum of local losses, each of which is associated to one agent. Agents
noisy observations could be nonlinear. We formulate this problem as a
distributed online optimization where agents communicate with each other to
track the minimizer of the global loss. We then propose a decentralized version
of the Mirror Descent algorithm and provide the non-asymptotic analysis of the
problem. Using the notion of dynamic regret, we measure the performance of our
algorithm versus its offline counterpart in the centralized setting. We prove
that the bound on dynamic regret scales inversely in the network spectral gap,

using higher-order Markov chains. This Letter introduces a Bayesian framework
to determine, from data, the number of prior states of recent history upon
which a trajectory is statistically dependent. The general recommendation is to
use leave-one-out cross validation, using an easily-computable formula that is
provided in closed form. Importantly, Bayes factors using flat model priors are
biased in favor of too-complex a model (more hysteresis) when a large amount of
data is present and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is biased in favor
of too-sparse a model (less hysteresis) when few data are present.

that this sexual component of ZIKV transmission induces novel processes on
networks through the highly asymmetric durations of infectiousness between
males and females -- it is estimated that males are infectious for periods up
to ten times longer than females -- leading to an asymmetric percolation
process on the network of sexual contacts. We exactly solve the properties of
this asymmetric percolation on random sexual contact networks and show that
this process exhibits two epidemic transitions corresponding to a

emerges because of the asymmetric percolation. We provide an exact analytical

The analysis of student course records can untangle common patterns in course

examines the relationship between gender and undergraduate physics study, using
course records from over nine thousand students who enrolled in physics at the
University of Auckland, spanning a six year period.
  Physics students' demographic and course records were analyzed to find out
whether there were gender differences in subject selection, course performance,
and confidence. Subsequent to taking a first year physics course, female
students were more likely to take further courses in life science subjects,
while male students were more likely to take physical science subjects. In
first year courses, gender differences were not present among highly
academically prepared students, for whom school type (single-sex or
coeducational) was a better predictor of course outcome. However, of those
students who were less academically prepared in their first year, male students
tended to outperform female students. Female students were also more likely to
take an introductory physics course before an advancing course, compared to
male students, after controlling for academic preparation. Science capital, a
concept related to Pierre Bourdieu's notions of capital and habitus, was
employed as an interpretive research framework. Habitus, the system of
dispositions one uses to interpret the world, is largely influenced by the
socio-cultural context in which an individual builds their identity. The
following study explains how an interaction between science capital and an
individual's habitus may lead to gender disparities in student outcomes in the

function in the presence of noise. Most of the solution techniques in SO
estimate gradients from the noise corrupted observations of the objective and
adjust parameters of the objective along the direction of the estimated
gradients to obtain locally optimal solutions. Two prominent algorithms in SO
namely Random Direction Kiefer-Wolfowitz (RDKW) and Simultaneous Perturbation
Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) obtain noisy gradient estimate by randomly
perturbing all the parameters simultaneously. This forces the search direction
to be random in these algorithms and causes them to suffer additional noise on
top of the noise incurred from the samples of the objective. Owing to this
additional noise, the idea of using deterministic perturbations instead of
random perturbations for gradient estimation has also been studied. Two
specific constructions of the deterministic perturbation sequence using
lexicographical ordering and Hadamard matrices have been explored and
encouraging results have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we
characterize the class of deterministic perturbation sequences that can be
utilized in the RDKW algorithm. This class expands the set of known
deterministic perturbation sequences available in the literature. Using our
characterization we propose a construction of a deterministic perturbation
sequence that has the least possible cycle length among all deterministic
perturbations. Through simulations we illustrate the performance gain of the
proposed deterministic perturbation sequence in the RDKW algorithm over the
Hadamard and the random perturbation counterparts. We establish the convergence
of the RDKW algorithm for the generalized class of deterministic perturbations.

molecular evolution of organisms. In fish species, a WGD is considered to have
occurred in the ancestral lineage of teleosts. Recent comprehensive ortholog
comparisons among teleost genomes have provided useful data and insights into
the fate of redundant genes generated by WGD. Based on these data, a
mathematical model is proposed to explain the evolutionary scenario of genes
after WGD. The model is parameterized taking into account an equilibrium
between i) rapid loss of either of the duplicate genes and ii) moderate
functional differentiation of each of duplicate genes, both of which are
followed by slow gene loss under purifying selection. This model predicts that,
in the teleost lineage, a maximum of about 3000 gene pairs may have
differentiated functionally during 90 million years after WGD. Thus, the
present study provides a possibility that the whole impact of WGD can be
quantitatively assessed according to the model parameters, before details of
genomic structural changes or functional differentiation are investigated. If
the equilibrium model is valid not only for teleosts but also for other
lineages that have undergone WGDs, correlations between the assessment indices
and evolutionarily significant events, such as the diversification of species
or the occurrence of novel phenotypes, could be tested and compared among those
lineages.

braneworld model with a phenomenology involved. We find that the odd
eigenfunctions have non-trivial contributions and the first eigenstate of the
Kaluza-Klein tower has the highest contribution. The calculation of slight

braneworld scenarios matching with future experimental measurements in high

reconstruction and robot vision. Although the original motion averaging
algorithm has been introduced as an effective means to solve the multi-view
registration problem, it does not consider the reliability and accuracy of each
relative motion. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel motion averaging
algorithm for multi-view registration. Firstly, it utilizes the pair-wise
registration algorithm to estimate the relative motion and overlapping
percentage of each scan pair with a certain degree of overlap. With the
overlapping percentage available, it views the overlapping percentage as the
corresponding weight of each scan pair and proposes the weight motion averaging
algorithm, which can pay more attention to reliable and accurate relative
motions. By treating each relative motion distinctively, more accurate
registration can be achieved by applying the weighted motion averaging to
multi-view range scans. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy, robustness and efficiency.

adaptive controller employs a new distributed observer that does not rely on
the joint velocity and a new kinematic parameter adaptation law with a
distributed adaptive kinematic regressor matrix that is driven by both the
observation and consensus errors. In addition, it is shown that the proposed
controller has the separation property, which yields an adaptive kinematic
controller that is applicable to most industrial/commercial robots. The
performance of the proposed observer-based adaptive schemes is shown by

publish aggregated mobility data, such as the number of users covered by a

preserving users' privacy. However, in this paper, we argue and prove that even
publishing aggregated mobility data could lead to privacy breach in

the uniqueness and regularity of human mobility to recover individual's
trajectories from the aggregated mobility data without any prior knowledge. By
conducting experiments on two real-world datasets collected from both mobile

recover users' trajectories with accuracy about 73%~91% at the scale of tens of

overheads of managing distributed system and lack of high level parallel

chances of node failures which cause multiple re-executions of tasks. These
problems can be overcome by the MapReduce framework introduced by Google.
MapReduce is an efficient, scalable and simplified programming model for large

multi-agent systems with guarantees over rate of convergence, resilience to
control gain uncertainties, and Pareto optimality of design parameters, namely,
the event-triggering threshold (ET) and control gain. The event-triggered
consensus problem is first converted to stability problem of an equivalent
system. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then used to incorporate the
performance constraints with the event-triggered consensus. Using an
approximated linear scalarization method, the ET and the control gain are
designed simultaneously by solving a convex constrained optimization problem.
Followed by some preliminary steps, the optimization can be performed locally,
i.e., no global information is required. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is studied through simulations for an experimental multi-agent system.

the difficulty originating from the unpredictable and drastic changes in the

Tropical Atlantic Ridge). This study generalizes to different seismotectonic

Furthermore, we explore low-dimensional surfaces along which the light curves
of eclipsing binaries are concentrated, to use in the characterization of the
binary systems and in the exploration of biases of the full unknown Gaia data
with respect to the training sets. We explore the performance of principal
component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest

time series by combining a double Gaussian profile fit and a smoothing spline,
in order to de-noise and interpolate the observed light curves. We achieve
further denoising, and selected the most important variability elements from
the light curves using PCA. We perform supervised classification using random
forest and LDA based on the PC decomposition, while SOM gives a continuous
2-dimensional manifold of the light curves arranged by a few important
features. We estimate the uncertainty of the supervised methods due to the
specific finite training set using ensembles of models constructed on

framework to overcome the limitation of translational motion model and maintain
low computational complexity. The proposed framework mainly has three key
contributions. First, we propose to reduce the number of affine motion
parameters from 6 to 4. The proposed four-parameter affine motion model can not
only handle most of the complex motions in natural videos but also save the
bits for two parameters. Second, to efficiently encode the affine motion
parameters, we propose two motion prediction modes, i.e., advanced affine
motion vector prediction combined with a gradient-based fast affine motion
estimation algorithm and affine model merge, where the latter attempts to reuse
the affine motion parameters (instead of the motion vectors) of neighboring
blocks. Third, we propose two fast affine motion compensation algorithms. One
is the one-step sub-pixel interpolation, which reduces the computations of each
interpolation. The other is the interpolation-precision-based adaptive block
size motion compensation, which performs motion compensation at the block level
rather than the pixel level to reduce the interpolation times. Our proposed
techniques have been implemented based on the state-of-the-art high efficiency
video coding standard, and the experimental results show that the proposed
techniques altogether achieve on average 11.1% and 19.3% bits saving for random
access and low delay configurations, respectively, on typical video sequences
that have rich rotation or zooming motions. Meanwhile, the computational
complexity increases of both encoder and decoder are within an acceptable

protons that got defocused by the transverse plasma wakefields after passing
through the plasma, at two locations downstream the end of the plasma. This

used the visibility of an interference pattern to quantify the wave property

to characterize the wave property, the understanding of wave-particle duality
would be strengthened. A recent theoretical work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 160406

Here, we demonstrate the new measure of wave-particle duality based on two
kinds of coherence measures quantitatively for the first time. The wave
property, quantified by the coherence in the l1-norm measure and the relative
entropy measure, can be obtained via tomography of the target state, which is
encoded in the path degree of freedom of the photons. The particle property,
quantified by the path information, can be obtained via the discrimination of
detector states, which is encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of the
photons. Our work may deepen people's understanding of coherence and provide a
new perspective regarding wave-particle duality.

associated conditionality constants $k_{m}[\mathcal{B}]$ verify the estimate
$k_{m}[\mathcal{B}]=\mathcal{O}(\log m)$. Answering a question raised by
Temlyakov, Yang, and Ye, several authors have studied whether this bound can be
improved when we consider quasi-greedy bases in some special class of spaces.
It is known that every quasi-greedy basis in a superreflexive Banach space
verifies $k_{m}[\mathcal{B}]=(\log m)^{1-\epsilon}$ for some $0<\epsilon<1$,
and this is optimal. Our first goal in this paper will be to fill the gap in
between the general case and the superreflexive case and investigate the growth
of the conditionality constants in non-superreflexive spaces. Roughly speaking,
the moral will be that we can guarantee optimal bounds only for quasi-greedy
bases in superreflexive spaces. We prove that if a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ is
not superreflexive then there is a quasi-greedy basis $\mathcal{B}$ in a Banach
space $\mathbb{Y}$ finitely representable in $\mathbb{X}$ with
$k_{m}[\mathcal{B}] \approx \log m$. As a consequence we obtain that for every
$2<q<\infty$ there is a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ of type $2$ and cotype $q$
possessing a quasi-greedy basis $\mathcal{B}$ with $k_{m}[\mathcal{B}] \approx
\log m$. We also tackle the corresponding problem for Schauder bases and show
that if a space is non-superreflexive then it possesses a basic sequence

dynamic environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized to be
promising for specifying such tasks in a relatively simple manner. However, the
strong dependency between the learning method and the task to learn is a
well-known problem that restricts practical implementations of RL in robotics,
often requiring major modifications of parameters and adding other techniques
for each particular task. In this paper we present a practical core
implementation of RL which enables the learning process for multiple robotic
tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods,
this implementation includes a novel approach for action selection, called
Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), which avoids poor performance of the
learning process when the robot reaches new unexplored states. Our approach
takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical
variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, X,Y,{\theta} pose, etc.),
thus experienced sets of states may favor the decision-making process of
unexplored or rarely-explored states. This improvement has a relevant role in
reducing the tuning of the algorithm for particular tasks. Experiments with
real and simulated robots, performed with the software framework also
introduced here, show that our implementation is effectively able to learn
different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. Results also
suggest that the combination of true online SARSA({\lambda}) with QBIASSR can
outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks.

perform poorly when tested on data acquired in different settings is
theoretically explained in domain adaptation through a shift among

problem, especially in the challenging setting where no labeled data are
available for the target domain, is paramount for having visual recognition
systems working in the wild. As the problem stems from a shift among
distributions, intuitively one should try to align them. In the literature,
this has resulted in a stream of works attempting to align the feature
representations learned from the source and target domains. Here we take a
different route. Rather than introducing regularization terms aiming to promote
the alignment of the two representations, we act at the distribution level
through the introduction of \emph{DomaIn Alignment Layers} (\DIAL), able to
match the observed source and target data distributions to a reference one.

intensity, polarization and frequency. We show that the time-dependent band
structure contains many unconventional features that are not captured by
considering the Floquet eigenvalues alone. By analyzing the evolution in time
of the state population we have identified regimes for the emergence of
time-dependent edge states responsible of charge oscillations across the
ribbon.

introduction of the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset. Different from object
detection in static images, temporal information in videos is vital for object
detection. To fully utilize temporal information, state-of-the-art methods are
based on spatiotemporal tubelets, which are essentially sequences of associated
bounding boxes across time. However, the existing methods have major
limitations in generating tubelets in terms of quality and efficiency.
Motion-based methods are able to obtain dense tubelets efficiently, but the
lengths are generally only several frames, which is not optimal for
incorporating long-term temporal information. Appearance-based methods, usually
involving generic object tracking, could generate long tubelets, but are
usually computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a framework for
object detection in videos, which consists of a novel tubelet proposal network
to efficiently generate spatiotemporal proposals, and a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) network that incorporates temporal information from tubelet proposals
for achieving high object detection accuracy in videos. Experiments on the
large-scale ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

some analogous arrangement on an accelerator card. Such parallel performance is
becoming a critical requirement for methods to reconstruct the tracks of
charged particles at the Large Hadron Collider and, in the future, at the High
Luminosity LHC. This is because the steady increase in luminosity is causing an
exponential growth in the overall event reconstruction time, and tracking is by
far the most demanding task for both online and offline processing. Many past

tracking because of their robustness and their excellent physics performance,
especially for solid state detectors where material interactions play a
significant role. We report on the progress of our studies towards a Kalman
filter track reconstruction algorithm with optimal performance on manycore
architectures. The combinatorial structure of these algorithms is not
immediately compatible with an efficient SIMD (or SIMT) implementation; the
challenge for us is to recast the existing software so it can readily generate
hundreds of shared-memory threads that exploit the underlying instruction set

X-ray luminosity. In particular, the hardness of the X-ray continuum is found
to depend on luminosity. In a few sources, the correlation between the energy
of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) and the luminosity is
clear. Different types (signs) of the correlation are believed to reflect
different accretion modes. We analyse two NuSTAR observations of the transient
accreting pulsar Cep X-4 during its 2014 outburst. Our analysis is focused on a
detailed investigation of the dependence of the CRSF energy and of the spectral
hardness on X-ray luminosity, especially on short timescales. To investigate
the spectral changes as a function of luminosity within each of the two
observations, we used the intrinsic variability of the source on the timescale
of individual pulse cycles (tens of seconds), the so-called pulse-to-pulse
variability. We find that the NuSTAR spectrum of Cep X-4 contains two CRSFs:
the fundamental line at ~30 keV and its harmonic at ~55 keV. We find for the
first time that the energy of the fundamental CRSF increases and the continuum
becomes harder with increasing X-ray luminosity not only between the two
observations, that is, on the long timescale, but also within an individual
observation, on the timescale of a few tens of seconds. We investigate these
dependencies in detail including their non-linearity. We discuss a possible
physical interpretation of the observed behaviour in the frame of a simple
one-dimensional model of the polar emitting region with a collisionless shock
formed in the infalling plasma near the neutron star surface. With this model,
we are able to reproduce the observed variations of the continuum hardness

holes to the K-valleys in each layer. Since these high-momentum valleys are
usually not aligned across the interface of two TMDC monolayers, how parallel
momentum is conserved in the charge separation or recombination process becomes
a key question. Here we probe this question using the model system of a type-II
heterojunction formed by MoS2 and WSe2 monolayers and the experimental
technical of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. Upon photo-excitation
specifically of WSe2 at the heterojunction, we observe ultrafast (<40 fs)

thus, momentum mismatch between the two TMDCs. The resulting interlayer charge
transfer exciton decays via nonradiatively recombination, with rates varying by
up to three-orders of magnitude from sample to sample, but with no correlation
with inter-layer angular alignment. We suggest that the initial interfacial
charge separation and the subsequent interfacial charge recombination processes
circumvent momentum mismatch via excess electronic energy and via

probability by marginalizing decisions about latent segmentation alternatives
to derive a sequence probability: the former uses a globally normalized joint

SCRF and CTC losses, where the same recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder is

the user equipment (UE) through a time-varying wireless channel at an energy
cost that depends on the channel state and the number of contents downloaded.
The user accesses the OSN at random time instants, and consumes all the
relevant contents. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose
\textit{proactive caching} of contents under favorable channel conditions to a
finite capacity cache memory. Assuming that the channel quality (or
equivalently, the cost of downloading data) is memoryless over time slots, we
show that the optimal caching policy, which may replace contents in the cache
with shorter remaining lifetime with contents at the server that remain
relevant longer, has certain threshold structure with respect to the channel
quality. Since the optimal policy is computationally demanding in practice, we
introduce a simplified caching scheme and optimize its parameters using policy
search. We also present two lower bounds on the energy consumption. We
demonstrate through numerical simulations that the proposed caching scheme
significantly reduces the energy consumption compared to traditional reactive
caching tools, and achieves close-to-optimal performance for a wide variety of

show that using approximations of mixture models enable us to compute a

other computationally intensive optimal transport plans; finally, an affine

traditional network architectures by decoupling network control and forwarding.
So far, the use cases for SDN mainly targeted data-center applications. This
article considers SDN for network carriers, facing operation of large-scale
networks with millions of customers, multiple technologies, and high
availability demands. With specific carrier-grade features such as scalability,
reliability, flexibility, modularity, and virtualization in mind, the SPARC EU
project has developed the SPARC SplitArchitecture concept. The
SplitArchitecture control plane allows hierarchical layering of several control
plane layers which can be flexibly mapped to data plane layers. Between control
layers open interfaces are used. Furthermore, SplitArchitecture proposes an
additional split of forwarding and processing functions in data path elements,
enabling switch based OAM functionality and handling of tunneling techniques.
The SplitArchitecture concept is evaluated in a prototype demonstrating an SDN
version of BRAS: the floating BRAS. The floating BRAS allows creation of
residential Internet access services with dynamically managed BRAS instances.
The demo is based on a controller enabling protected MPLS transport connections
spanning SDN-controlled aggregation and IP/MPLS-based core domains. The
prototype showcases how SplitArchitecture enables virtualization of service
nodes in an SDN-controlled network, leading to increased flexibility in
configuration and placement of service creation functions. Overall, the results
show that it is technically and economically beneficial to apply SDN, and
specifically the SplitArchitecture concept, to the carrier domain.

address the fundamental physics problem of particle-wave duality and the
measurability of a free electron quantum wavepacket. Our analysis of stimulated
radiative interaction of an electron wavepacket, accompanied by numerical
computations, reveals two limits. In the quantum regime of long wavepacket size
relative to radiation wavelength, one obtains only quantum-recoil multiphoton
sidebands in the electron energy spectrum. In the opposite regime, the
wavepacket interaction approaches the limit of classical point-particle
acceleration. The wavepacket features can be revealed in experiments carried
out in the intermediate regime of wavepacket size commensurate with the
radiation wavelength.

of systematic uncertainty in neutrino-oscillation studies. A precise $\nu A$
scattering model, in which multinucleon effects are incorporated, is pivotal
for an accurate interpretation of the data. [Purpose] In $\nu A$ interactions,
meson-exchange currents (MECs) can induce two-nucleon ($2N$) knockout from the
target nucleus, resulting in a two-particle two-hole (2p2h) final state. They
also affect single nucleon ($1N$) knockout reactions, yielding a one-particle
one-hole (1p1h) final state. Both channels affect the inclusive strength. We
present a study of axial and vector, seagull and pion-in-flight currents in
muon-neutrino induced $1N$ and $2N$ knockout reactions on $^{12}$C. [Method]
Bound and emitted nucleons are described as Hartree-Fock wave functions. For
the vector MECs, the standard expressions are used. For the axial current,
three parameterizations are considered. The framework developed here allows for
a treatment of MECs and short-range correlations (SRCs). [Results] Results are
compared with electron-scattering data and with literature. The strengths of
the seagull, pion-in-flight and axial currents are studied separately and
double differential cross sections including MECs are compared with results
including SRCs. A comparison with MiniBooNE and T2K data is presented.
[Conclusions] In the 1p1h channel, the effects of the MECs tend to cancel each
other, resulting in a small effect on the double differential cross section.
$2N$ knockout processes provide a small contribution to the inclusive double
differential cross section, ranging from the $2N$ knockout threshold into the
dip region. A fair agreement with the MiniBooNE and T2K data is reached.

estimates the sequence in which biomarkers for a disease become abnormal. This
helps in understanding the dynamics of disease progression and facilitates
early diagnosis by staging patients on a disease progression timeline. Existing
EBM methods are all generative in nature. In this work we propose a novel
discriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate as well as
computationally more efficient than existing state-of-the art EBM methods. The
method first estimates for each subject an approximate ordering of events, by
ranking the posterior probabilities of individual biomarkers being abnormal.
Subsequently, the central ordering over all subjects is estimated by fitting a
generalized Mallows model to these approximate subject-specific orderings based
on a novel probabilistic Kendall's Tau distance. To evaluate the accuracy, we
performed extensive experiments on synthetic data simulating the progression of
Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the method was applied to the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to estimate the central event
ordering in the dataset. The experiments benchmark the accuracy of the new
model under various conditions and compare it with existing state-of-the-art
EBM methods. The results indicate that discriminative EBM could be a simple and
elegant approach to disease progression modeling.

Pineapple equipment are used for passively capturing ambient probe requests

  The proof is based on a novel, intimate relation between Hopf algebras,
vertex algebras and a class of multivalued analytic special functions, which
are generalizations of Selberg integrals. We prove that the zeroes of these
special functions correspond to the algebra relations of the respective Nichols
algebra, by proving an analytical quantum symmetrizer formula for the

fails and the screening operators generate an extension of the Nichols algebra.

a universal interrogation protocol based on composite laser-pulses spectroscopy
with phase-modulation eliminating probe-induced frequency shifts at all orders
in presence of various dissipative processes. Unlike frequency shifts
extrapolation-based methods, a universal interrogation protocol based on
$\pm\pi/4$ and $\pm3\pi/4$ phase-modulated resonances is proposed which does
not compromise the stability of the optical clock while maintaining an
ultra-robust error signal gradient in presence of substantial uncompensated ac
Stark-shifts. Such a scheme can be implemented in two flavours: either by
inverting clock state initialization or by pulse order reversal even without a
perfect quantum state initialization. This universal interrogation protocol can
be applied to atomic, molecular and nuclear frequency metrology, mass
spectrometry and to the field of precision spectroscopy. It might be designed
using magic-wave induced transitions, two-photon excitation and
magnetically-induced spectroscopy or it might even be implemented with quantum
logic gate circuit and qubit entanglement.

transition phenomenon that depends on the ratio between the number of samples

above a maximum threshold, the estimates become increasingly aligned with the

  Protection","Accepted in IEEE GLOBECOM 2015",,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) is envisioned to be one of the most
challenging security problems in the coming decade. One key challenge in CIP is
the ability to allocate resources, either personnel or cyber, to critical
infrastructures with different vulnerability and criticality levels. In this
work, a contract-theoretic approach is proposed to solve the problem of
resource allocation in critical infrastructure with asymmetric information. A
control center (CC) is used to design contracts and offer them to
infrastructures' owners. A contract can be seen as an agreement between the CC
and infrastructures using which the CC allocates resources and gets rewards in
return. Contracts are designed in a way to maximize the CC's benefit and
motivate each infrastructure to accept a contract and obtain proper resources
for its protection. Infrastructures are defined by both vulnerability levels
and criticality levels which are unknown to the CC. Therefore, each
infrastructure can claim that it is the most vulnerable or critical to gain
more resources. A novel mechanism is developed to handle such an asymmetric
information while providing the optimal contract that motivates each
infrastructure to reveal its actual type. The necessary and sufficient
conditions for such resource allocation contracts under asymmetric information
are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed contract-theoretic
approach maximizes the CC's utility while ensuring that no infrastructure has
an incentive to ask for another contract, despite the lack of exact information
at the CC.

states in three dimensions, which is mentioned in arXiv:quant-ph/0206110 as
unsuccessfully tackled. In this paper, we give an analytical proof that in this
case considering POVMs does indeed not give any additional power with respect
to projective measurements. To do so, we first make without loss of generality
some assumptions about the structure of an optimal POVM. The justification of
these assumptions involves arguments based on convexity, rank and symmetry
properties. We show then that any pure states perfectly excluded by such a POVM
meet the conditions identified in arXiv:quant-ph/0206110 for perfect exclusion
by a projective measurement of three pure states in three dimensions. We also
discuss possible generalizations of our work, including an application of
Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming that might be of special
interest.

source MOOSE finite element framework. This facility is based on the 'modular
free energy' approach in which the phase-field equations are implemented in a
general form that is logically separated from model-specific data such as the
thermodynamic free energy density and mobility functions. Free energy terms
contributing to a phase-field model are abstracted into self-contained objects
that can be dynamically combined at simulation run time. Combining multiple
chemical and mechanical free energy contributions expedites the construction of
coupled phase-field, mechanics, and multiphase models. This approach allows
computational material scientists to focus on implementing new material models,
and to reuse existing solution algorithms and data processing routines. A key
new aspect of the rapid phase-field development approach that we discuss in
detail is the automatic symbolic differentiation capability. Automatic symbolic
differentiation is used to compute derivatives of the free energy density
functionals, and removes potential sources of human error while guaranteeing
that the nonlinear system Jacobians are accurately approximated. Through
just-in-time compilation, we greatly reduce the computational expense of
evaluating the differentiated expressions. The new capability is demonstrated
for a variety of representative applications.

Experiments show that our automatic camera calibration method by detection of
two vanishing points reduces error by 50% (mean distance ratio error reduced
from 0.18 to 0.09) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. We also

dynamical fermion flavours in the adjoint representation. We focus our
attention on the ratio $R$ between the masses of the lightest spin-2 and spin-0

gauge/gravity dualities. For models in which large anomalous dimensions arise
dynamically, we show indications that this mass ratio can be large, with $R >

alignment of a moving robotic agent within that map by rendering using a
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This is done by recasting the scan alignment
part of the dense mapping process as a rendering task. Alignment errors are
computed from rendering the scene, comparing with range data from the sensors,
and minimized by an optimizer. The proposed approach takes advantage of the
advances in rendering techniques for computer graphics and GPU hardware to
accelerate the algorithm. Moreover, it allows one to exploit information not
used in classic dense mapping algorithms such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
by rendering interfaces between the free space, occupied space and the unknown.
The proposed approach leverages directly the rendering capabilities of the GPU,
in contrast to other GPU-based approaches that deploy the GPU as a general
purpose parallel computation platform.
  We argue that the proposed concept is a general consequence of treating
perception problems as inverse problems of rendering. Many perception problems
can be recast into a form where much of the computation is replaced by render
operations. This is not only efficient since rendering is fast, but also
simpler to implement and will naturally benefit from future advancements in GPU
speed and rendering techniques. Furthermore, this general concept can go beyond
addressing perception problems and can be used for other problem domains such
as path planning.

to construct and use the CF-ROM framework, we emphasize that it is built on
general ideas of spatial filtering and optimization and is independent of
(restrictive) phenomenological arguments. Thus, the CF-ROM framework can be
applied to a wide variety of PDEs.

extensively and proven instrumental in probing wave-particle duality in quantum

orbital angular momentum (OAM). Using spin-orbit hybrid entanglement of photons
we show that the OAM content of a photon can be erased with a complimentary
polarization projection of one of the entangled pair. The result is the
(dis)appearance of azimuthal fringes based on whether the \which-OAM""

and show that the OAM information and fringe visibility are complimentary.

is used to analyse the nonlinearities arising from a contacting delamination

are analysed by delayed Time Reversal -- Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy
signal processing method. This signal processing method allows to focus the
wave energy onto the receiving transducer and to modify the focused wave shape,
allowing to use several different methods, including pulse inversion, for
detecting the nonlinear signature of the damage. It is found that the small
crack with contacting acoustic nonlinearity produces a noticeable nonlinear
signature when using pulse inversion signal processing, and even higher
signature with delayed time reversal, without requiring any baseline

support large-scale heterogeneous traffic and users, therefore new modulation
and multiple access (MA) schemes are being developed to meet the changing
demands. As this research space is ever increasing, it becomes more important
to analyze the various approaches, therefore in this article we present a
comprehensive overview of the most promising modulation and MA schemes for 5G
networks. We first introduce the different types of modulation that indicate
their potential for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes and compare their
performance in terms of spectral efficiency, out-of-band leakage, and bit-error
rate. We then pay close attention to various types of non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) candidates, including power-domain NOMA, code-domain NOMA, and
NOMA multiplexing in multiple domains. From this exploration we can identify
the opportunities and challenges that will have significant impact on the
design of modulation and MA for 5G networks.

fixed non-trivial fourth-order polynomial differential algebraic equation (DAE)
such that for any positive continuous function $\varphi$ on the reals, and for
any positive continuous function $\epsilon(t)$, it has a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$
solution with $| y(t) - \varphi(t) | < \epsilon(t)$ for all $t$. Lee A. Rubel
provided an explicit example of such a polynomial DAE. Other examples of
universal DAE have later been proposed by other authors. However, Rubel's DAE
\emph{never} has a unique solution, even with a finite number of conditions of
the form $y^{(k_i)}(a_i)=b_i$.
  The question whether one can require the solution that approximates $\varphi$
to be the unique solution for a given initial data is a well known open problem
[Rubel 1981, page 2], [Boshernitzan 1986, Conjecture 6.2]. In this article, we
solve it and show that Rubel's statement holds for polynomial ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), and since polynomial ODEs have a unique solution
given an initial data, this positively answers Rubel's open problem. More
precisely, we show that there exists a \textbf{fixed} polynomial ODE such that
for any $\varphi$ and $\epsilon(t)$ there exists some initial condition that
yields a solution that is $\epsilon$-close to $\varphi$ at all times.
  In particular, the solution to the ODE is necessarily analytic, and we show
that the initial condition is computable from the target function and error
function.

to develop and render people-centric services. In this paper, we address the
privacy implication, optimal pricing, and bundling of people-centric services.
We first define the inverse correlation between the service quality and privacy
level from data analytics perspectives. We then present the profit maximization
models of selling standalone, complementary, and substitute services.
Specifically, the closed-form solutions of the optimal privacy level and
subscription fee are derived to maximize the gross profit of service providers.
For interrelated people-centric services, we show that cooperation by service
bundling of complementary services is profitable compared to the separate sales
but detrimental for substitutes. We also show that the market value of a
service bundle is correlated with the degree of contingency between the
interrelated services. Finally, we incorporate the profit sharing models from
game theory for dividing the bundling profit among the cooperative service
providers.
