adapt to a variety of different data sets using the same underlying rules

Recently, a new class of Hebbian-like and local unsupervised learning rules for
neural networks have been developed that minimise a similarity matching
cost-function. These have been shown to perform sparse representation learning.
This study tests the effectiveness of one such learning rule for learning
features from images. The rule implemented is derived from a nonnegative
classical multidimensional scaling cost-function, and is applied to both single
and multi-layer architectures. The features learned by the algorithm are then
used as input to an SVM to test their effectiveness in classification on the
established CIFAR-10 image dataset. The algorithm performs well in comparison
to other unsupervised learning algorithms and multi-layer networks, thus
suggesting its validity in the design of a new class of compact, online
learning networks.

However, there are costs to their maintenance, resulting in a trade-off between
quality and quantity, a typical strategy being to put a lot of effort on a few
high-intensity relationships while maintaining larger numbers of less close
relationships. It has also been shown that there are persistent individual
differences in this pattern; some individuals allocate their efforts more
uniformly across their networks, while others strongly focus on their closest
relationships. Furthermore, some individuals maintain more stable networks than
others. Here, we focus on how personality traits of individuals affect this
picture, using mobile phone calls records and survey data from the Mobile
Territorial Lab (MTL) study. In particular, we look at the relationship between
personality traits and the (i) persistence of social signatures, namely the
similarity of the social signature shape of an individual measured in different
time intervals; (ii) the turnover in egocentric networks, that is, differences
in the set of alters present at two consecutive temporal intervals; and (iii)
the rank dynamics defined as the variation of alter rankings in egocentric
networks in consecutive intervals. We observe that some traits have effects on
the stability of the social signatures as well as network turnover and rank
dynamics. As an example, individuals who score highly in the Openness to
Experience trait tend to have higher levels of network turnover and larger
alter rank variations. On broader terms, our study shows that personality
traits clearly affect the ways in which individuals maintain their personal
networks.

The estimator is integrated in the structure of segregated solvers for the

state integrating available observation in the CFD model, naturally preserving
a zero-divergence condition for the velocity field. Because of the prohibitive
costs associated with a complete Kalman Filter application, two model reduction
strategies have been proposed and assessed. These strategies dramatically
reduce the increase in computational costs of the model, which can be
quantified in an increase of $10\% - 15\%$ with respect to the classical
numerical simulation. In addition, an extended analysis of the behavior of the
numerical model covariance $Q$ has been performed. The results have shown that
optimized values are strongly linked to the truncation error of the
discretization procedure. The estimator has been applied to the analysis of a
number of test cases exhibiting increasing complexity, including turbulent flow
configurations. The results show that the augmented flow successfully improves
the prediction of the physical quantities investigated, even when the
observation is provided in a limited region of the physical domain. In
addition, the present work indicates that these Data Assimilation techniques,
which are at an embryonic stage of development in CFD, can be pushed even
further using the augmented prediction as a powerful tool for the optimization
of the free parameters in the numerical simulation.

Ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) are stellar systems displaying colours
and metallicities between those of globular clusters (GCs) and early-type dwarf
galaxies, as well as sizes of Reff <= 100 pc and luminosities in the range
-13.5 < MV < -11 mag. Although their origin is still subject of debate, the
most popular scenarios suggest that they are massive star clusters or the
nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies. Aims. NGC 5044 is the central
massive elliptical galaxy of the NGC 5044 group. Its GC/UCD system is
completely unexplored. Methods. In Gemini+GMOS deep images of several fields
around NGC 5044 and in spectroscopic multi-object data of one of these fields,
we detected an unresolved source with g'~20.6 mag, compatible with being an
UCD. Its radial velocity was obtained with FXCOR and the penalized
pixel-fitting (pPXF) code. To study its stellar population content, we measured
the Lick/IDS indices and compared them with predictions of single stellar
population models, and we used the full spectral fitting technique. Results.
The spectroscopic analysis of the UCD revealed a radial velocity that agrees
with the velocity of the elliptical galaxy NGC 5044. From the Lick/IDS indices,
we have obtained a luminosity-weighted age and metallicity of 11.7+/-1.4 Gyr
and [Z/H] = -0.79 +/- 0.04 dex, respectively, as well as [alpha/Fe] = 0.30 +/-
0.06. From the full spectral fitting technique, we measured a lower age (8.52
Gyr) and a similar total metallicity ([Z/H] = -0.86 dex). Conclusions. Our
results indicate that NGC 5044-UCD1 is most likely an extreme GC (MV ~ -12.5
mag) belonging to the GC system of the elliptical galaxy NGC 5044.

$X_{G}(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots)$ of a graph $G$. It is a sum of monomial symmetric
functions such that for each vertex coloring of $G$ there is exactly one of
these summands. The question, whether $X_{G}(x_1,x_{2},\ldots)$ distinguishes
nonisomorphic trees with the same number of vertices, is still open in general.
For special trees it has already been shown. In 2008, Martin, Morin and Wagner
proved it for spiders and some caterpillars. We decompose a tree by separating
the leafs and their neighbors and do the same to the remaining forest until
there remains a forest with vertices of degree not greater than $1$. For
nonisomorphic trees $G$ and $H$ with the same number of vertices and special
properties concerning their number of leafs and leaf neighbors for each
subgraph in their leaf decomposition we prove that the chromatic symmetric
function distinguishes the graphs. Our idea is to find independent partitions
of $G$ and $H$ with respectively a block of maximal cardinality for $G$ as well
as for $H$. These cardinalities are different for graphs $G$ and $H$ with
special properties of their leaf decompositions. Additionally, we give explicit

mathematical backdoors or by-design backdoors, which are put directly at the
mathematical design of the encryption algorithm. While the algorithm may be
totally public, proving that there is a backdoor, identifying it and exploiting
it, may be an intractable problem. We intend to explain that it is probably
possible to design and put such backdoors. Considering a particular family
(among all the possible ones), we present BEA-1, a block cipher algorithm which
is similar to the AES and which contains a mathematical backdoor enabling an
operational and effective cryptanalysis. The BEA-1 algorithm (80-bit block

cryptanalyses. A challenge will be proposed to the cryptography community soon.

wide range of physical systems in electromagnetics, optics, and acoustics.
Recent efforts to create nonreciprocal devices have departed from established
magneto-optic methods and instead exploited momentum based techniques such as
coherent spatiotemporal modulation of resonators and waveguides. However, to
date the nonreciprocal frequency responses that such devices can achieve have
been limited, mainly to either broadband or Lorentzian-shaped transfer
functions. Here we show that nonreciprocal coupling between waveguides and
resonator networks enables the creation of devices with customizable
nonreciprocal frequency responses. We create nonreciprocal coupling through the
action of synthetic phonons, which emulate propagating phonons and can scatter
light between guided and resonant modes that differ in both frequency and
momentum. We implement nonreciprocal coupling in microstrip circuits and
experimentally demonstrate both elementary nonreciprocal functions such as
isolation and gyration as well as reconfigurable, higher-order nonreciprocal
filters. Our results suggest nonreciprocal coupling as platform for a broad
class of customizable nonreciprocal systems, adaptable to all wave phenomena.

uncertainty that formally emerges from a multiclass M/M/1 queueing control
problem under heavy-traffic with model uncertainty. The BCP is formulated as a
multidimensional stochastic differential game with two players: a minimizer
that has an equivalent role to the decision maker in the queueing control
problem and a maximizer whose role is to set up the uncertainty of the model.
The dynamics are driven by a Brownian motion. We show that a state-space
collapse propery holds. That is, the multidimensional BCP can be reduced to a
one-dimensional BCP with model uncertainty that also takes the form of a
two-player stochastic differential game. Then, the value function of both of
the games is characterized as the unique solution to a free-boundary problem
from which we extract equilibria for both games. Finally, we analyze the
dependence of the value function and the equilibria on the ambiguity
parameters.

endowed with a Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature. When the
space-time is an FLRW universe, such theories produce a very wide
generalization of two-field $\alpha$-attractor models, being parameterized by a
positive constant $\alpha$, by the choice of a finitely-generated surface group
$\Gamma\subset \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ (which is isomorphic with the
fundamental group of $\Sigma$) and by the choice of a scalar potential defined
on $\Sigma$. The traditional two-field $\alpha$-attractor models arise when
$\Gamma$ is the trivial group, in which case $\Sigma$ is the Poincar\'e disk.
We give a general prescription for the study of such models through
uniformization in the so-called ""non-elementary"" case and discuss some of their
qualitative features in the gradient flow approximation, which we relate to
Morse theory. We also discuss some aspects of the SRST approximation in these
models, showing that it is generally not well-suited for studying dynamics near
cusp ends. When $\Sigma$ is non-compact and the scalar potential is
""well-behaved"" at the ends, we show that, in the {\em naive} local one-field
truncation, our generalized models have the same universal behavior as ordinary
one-field $\alpha$-attractors if inflation happens near any of the ends of
$\Sigma$ where the extended potential has a local maximum, for trajectories
which are well approximated by non-canonically parameterized geodesics near the
ends, we also discuss spiral trajectories near the ends.

learning. It extracts latent principal factors that contribute to the most
variation of the data. When data are stored across multiple machines, however,
communication cost can prohibit the computation of PCA in a central location
and distributed algorithms for PCA are thus needed. This paper proposes and
studies a distributed PCA algorithm: each node machine computes the top $K$
eigenvectors and transmits them to the central server; the central server then
aggregates the information from all the node machines and conducts a PCA based
on the aggregated information. We investigate the bias and variance for the
resulting distributed estimator of the top $K$ eigenvectors. In particular, we
show that for distributions with symmetric innovation, the empirical top
eigenspaces are unbiased and hence the distributed PCA is ""unbiased"". We derive
the rate of convergence for distributed PCA estimators, which depends
explicitly on the effective rank of covariance, eigen-gap, and the number of
machines. We show that when the number of machines is not unreasonably large,
the distributed PCA performs as well as the whole sample PCA, even without full
access of whole data. The theoretical results are verified by an extensive
simulation study. We also extend our analysis to the heterogeneous case where
the population covariance matrices are different across local machines but
share similar top eigen-structures.

subset $S$ of colored vertices, with all remaining vertices being non-colored.
At each discrete time interval, a colored vertex with exactly one non-colored
neighbor forces this non-colored neighbor to be colored. The initial set $S$ is
called a forcing set of $G$ if, by iteratively applying the forcing process,
every vertex in $G$ becomes colored. If the initial set $S$ has the added
property that it induces a subgraph of $G$ without isolated vertices, then $S$
is called a total forcing set in $G$. The minimum cardinality of a total
forcing set in $G$ is its total forcing number, denoted $F_t(G)$. We prove that
if $T$ is a tree of order $n \ge 3$ with maximum degree~$\Delta$, then $F_t(T)
\le \frac{1}{\Delta}((\Delta - 1)n + 1)$, and we characterize the infinite
family of trees achieving equality in this bound. We also prove that if $T$ is
a non-trivial tree with $n_1$ leaves, then $F_t(T) \ge n_1$, and we
characterize the infinite family of trees achieving equality in this bound. As
a consequence of this result, the total forcing number of a non-trivial tree is
strictly greater than its forcing number. In particular, we prove that if $T$

origins of band warping and band non-parabolicity in electronic and vibrational
structures. Remarkably, we find a robust presence and connection with pairs of
topologically induced Dirac points in a primitive-rectangular lattice using a
$p$-type tight-binding approximation. We provide a transparent analysis of
two-dimensional primitive-rectangular and square Bravais lattices whose basic
implications generalize to more complex structures. Band warping typically
arises at the onset of a singular transition to a crystal lattice with a larger
symmetry group, suddenly allowing the possibility of irreducible
representations of higher dimensions at special symmetry points in reciprocal
space. Band non-parabolicities are altogether different higher-order features,
although they may merge into band warping at the onset of a larger symmetry
group. Quite separately, although still maintaining a clear connection with
that merging, band non-parabolicities may produce pairs of conical
intersections at relatively low-symmetry points. Apparently, such conical
intersections are robustly maintained by global topology requirements, rather
than any local symmetry protection. For two $p$-type tight-binding bands, we
find such pairs of conical intersections drifting along the edges of restricted
Brillouin zones of primitive-rectangular Bravais lattices as lattice constants
vary relatively, until they merge into degenerate warped bands at high-symmetry
points at the onset of a square lattice. The conical intersections that we
found appear to have similar topological characteristics as Dirac points
extensively studied in graphene and other topological insulators, although our
conical intersections have none of the symmetry complexity and protection
afforded by the latter more complex structures.

found that the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO)
change with the number of MoS2 layers. The dependence of leakage current on the
band offset is also illustrated. At last, the band structure of monolayer MoS2

of OB-type stars contain strong (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields (~kG).
The prominent paradigm describing the interaction between the stellar winds and
the surface magnetic field is the magnetically confined wind shock (MCWS)
model. In this model, the stellar wind plasma is forced to move along the
closed field loops of the magnetic field, colliding at the magnetic equator,
and creating a shock. As the shocked material cools radiatively it will emit
X-rays. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy is a key tool in detecting and
characterizing the hot wind material confined by the magnetic fields of these
stars. Some B-type stars are found to have very short rotational periods. The
effects of the rapid rotation on the X-ray production within the magnetosphere
have yet to be explored in detail. The added centrifugal force due to rapid
rotation is predicted to cause faster wind outflows along the field lines,
leading to higher shock temperatures and harder X-rays. However, this is not
observed in all rapidly rotating magnetic B-type stars. In order to address
this from a theoretical point of view, we use the X-ray Analytical Dynamical
Magnetosphere (XADM) model, originally developed for slow rotators, with an
implementation of new rapid rotational physics. Using X-ray spectroscopy from
ESA's XMM-Newton space telescope, we observed 5 rapidly rotating B-type stars
to add to the previous list of observations. Comparing the observed X-ray
luminosity and hardness ratio to that predicted by the XADM allows us to
determine the role the added centrifugal force plays in the magnetospheric
X-ray emission of these stars.

The gamma-ray sensitivity is the efficiency for miscounting a gamma-ray pulse

the detectors.None of the gamma-ray sensitivity measurements described in the

improve the gamma-ray sensitivity, we tested the feasibility of gamma-ray pulse
rejection via Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD). While proving its feasibility,

operator (ISO) and a group of generators. The goal is to solve the DC optimal
power flow (DC-OPF) problem: have the generators collectively meet the power
demand while minimizing the aggregate generation cost and respecting line flow
limits in the network. The ISO by itself cannot solve the DC-OPF problem as
generators are strategic and do not share their cost functions. Instead, each
generator submits to the ISO a bid, consisting of the price per unit of
electricity at which it is willing to provide power. Based on the bids, the ISO
decides how much production to allocate to each generator to minimize the total
payment while meeting the load and satisfying the line limits. We provide a
provably correct, decentralized iterative scheme, termed BID ADJUSTMENT
ALGORITHM, for the resulting Bertrand competition game. Regarding convergence,
we show that the algorithm takes the generators' bids to any desired
neighborhood of the efficient Nash equilibrium at a linear convergence rate. As
a consequence, the optimal production of the generators converges to the
optimizer of the DC-OPF problem. Regarding robustness, we show that the
algorithm is robust to affine perturbations in the bid adjustment scheme and
that there is no incentive for any individual generator to deviate from the
algorithm by using an alternative bid update scheme. We also establish the
algorithm robustness to collusion, i.e., we show that, as long as each bus with
generation has a generator following the strategy, there is no incentive for
any group of generators to share information with the intent of tricking the
system to obtain a higher payoff. Simulations illustrate our results.

mutation within cells, and leading to a heterogeneous cell population within
tissues. In the competition for nutrients and growth space within the tumors
the phenotype of each cell determines its success. Selection in this process is
imposed by both the microenvironment (neighboring cells, extracellular matrix,
and diffusing substances), and the whole of the organism through for example
the blood supply. In this view, the development of tumor cells is in close
interaction with their increasingly changing environment: the more cells can
change, the more their environment will change. Furthermore, instabilities are
also introduced on the organism level: blood supply can be blocked by increased
tissue pressure or the tortuosity of the tumor-neovascular vessels. This
coupling between cell, microenvironment, and organism results in behavior that
is hard to predict. Here we introduce a cell-based computational model to study
the effect of blood flow obstruction on the micro-evolution of cells within a
cancerous tissue. We demonstrate that stages of tumor development emerge
naturally, without the need for sequential mutation of specific genes.
Secondly, we show that instabilities in blood supply can impact the overall
development of tumors and lead to the extinction of the dominant aggressive
phenotype, showing a clear distinction between the fitness at the cell level
and survival of the population. This provides new insights into potential side
effects of recent tumor vasculature renormalization approaches.

many brain functions, such as working memory, oculomotor control, head
movement, locomotion, and sensory processing. In this paper, we make the
connection between line attractors and pulse-gating in feedforward neuronal
networks. In this context, because of their neutral stability along a
one-dimensional manifold, line attractors are associated with a
time-translational invariance that allows graded information to be propagated
from one neuronal population to the next. To understand how pulse-gating
manifests itself in a high-dimensional, non-linear, feedforward
integrate-and-fire network, we use a Fokker-Planck approach to analyze system
dynamics. We make a connection between pulse-gated propagation in the
Fokker-Planck and population-averaged mean-field (firing rate) models, then
identify an approximate line attractor in state space as the essential
structure underlying graded information propagation. An analysis of the line
attractor shows that it consists of three fixed points: a central saddle with
an unstable manifold along the line and stable manifolds orthogonal to the
line, which is surrounded on either side by stable fixed points. Along the
manifold defined by the fixed points, slow dynamics give rise to a ghost. We
show that this line attractor arises at a cusp catastrophe, where a fold
bifurcation develops as a function of synaptic noise; and that the ghost
dynamics near the fold of the cusp underly the robustness of the line
attractor. Understanding the dynamical aspects of this cusp catastrophe allows
us to show how line attractors can persist in biologically realistic neuronal
networks and how the interplay of pulse gating, synaptic coupling and neuronal
stochasticity can be used to enable attracting one-dimensional manifolds and
thus, dynamically control the processing of graded information.

functions measure the dissimilarity between two probability density functions

underlying distributions without requiring distribution fitting or direct
integration. We derive a new data-driven complete basis that is similar to the
deterministic Bernstein polynomial basis and develop two methods for performing
basis expansions of functionals of two distributions. We also show that the new

PDEs with boundary conditions. The calculus of modelled distributions
established in Hairer (Invent. Math. 198, 2014) is extended to this setting. We
formulate and solve fixed point problems in these spaces with a class of
kernels that is sufficiently large to cover in particular the Dirichlet and
Neumann heat kernels. These results are then used to provide solution theories
for the KPZ equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and for the
2D generalised parabolic Anderson model with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
  In the case of the KPZ equation with Neumann boundary conditions, we show
that, depending on the class of mollifiers one considers, a ""boundary
renormalisation"" takes place. In other words, there are situations in which a
certain boundary condition is applied to an approximation to the KPZ equation,
but the limiting process is the Hopf-Cole solution to the KPZ equation with a
different boundary condition.

phase transition in LiVO$_2$ using microscopic calculations based on density
functional and dynamical mean field theories. The high-temperature rhombohedral
phase exhibits both magnetic and dynamical instabilities. Allowing a magnetic
solution for the rhombohedral structure does not open an insulating gap, and an
explicit treatment of the on-site Coulomb $U$ interaction is needed to
stabilize an insulating rhombohedral phase. The non-spin-polarized phonon
dispersions of the rhombohedral phase show two unstable phonon modes at the
wave vector $(\frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{3},0)$ that corresponds to the
experimentally observed trimer forming instability. A full relaxation of the
supercell corresponding to this instability yields a nonmagnetic state
containing V$_3$ trimers. These results are consistent with Goodenough's
suggestion that the high-temperature phase is in the localized-electron regime
and the transition to the low-temperature phase in the itinerant-electron
regime is driven by V-V covalency.

conventions at a fine-grained level.
  In analyzing the dynamics of conventions over time, however, even with
detailed on-line data, one encounters two significant challenges. First, as
conventions evolve, the underlying substance of their meaning tends to change
as well; and such substantive changes confound investigations of social
effects. Second, the selection of a convention takes place through the complex
interactions of individuals within a community, and contention between the
users of competing conventions plays a key role in the convention's evolution.
Any analysis must take place in the presence of these two issues.
  In this work we study a setting in which we can cleanly track the competition
among conventions. Our analysis is based on the spread of low-level authoring
conventions in the eprint arXiv over 24 years: by tracking the spread of macros
and other author-defined conventions, we are able to study conventions that
vary even as the underlying meaning remains constant. We find that the
interaction among co-authors over time plays a crucial role in the selection of
them; the distinction between more and less experienced members of the
community, and the distinction between conventions with visible versus
invisible effects, are both central to the underlying processes. Through our
analysis we make predictions at the population level about the ultimate success

the dynamics of a single synapse or an entire network of neurons. In Part I, we
model vesicle replenishment and release at the photoreceptor synapse to better
understand how visual information is processed. In Part II, we explore a simple
model of neural networks with the goal of discovering how network structure
shapes the behavior of the network.
  To fully understand how visual information is processed requires an
understanding of the way signals are transformed at the ribbon synapse of
photoreceptor neurons. These synapses possess a ribbon-like structure capable
of storing around 100 synaptic vesicles, allowing graded responses through the
release of different numbers of vesicles in response to visual input. These
responses depend critically on the ability of the ribbon to replenish itself as
ribbon sites empty upon release. The rate of vesicle replenishment is thus an
important factor in shaping neural coding in the retina. In collaboration with
experimental neuroscientists we developed a mathematical model to describe the
dynamics of vesicle release and replenishment at the ribbon synapse.
  To learn more about how network architecture shapes the dynamics of the
network, we study a specific type of threshold-linear network that is
constructed from a simple directed graph. The network construction guarantees
that differences in dynamics arise solely from differences in the connectivity
of the underlying graph. By design, the activity of these networks is bounded
and there are no stable fixed points. Computational experiments show that most
of these networks yield limit cycles where the neurons fire in sequence. We
devised an algorithm to predict the sequence of firing using the structure of
the underlying graph. Using the algorithm we classify all the networks of this

nearby stars which is in good agreement with the Hercules stream. In the model,
the Hercules stream is made of stars orbiting the Lagrange points of the bar
which move outward from the bar's corotation radius to visit the SNd. While the

calculated abundances and accretion rates of photospheric H, Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe and
Ni. The metal abundance ratios indicate that the two stars recently accreted
debris which is Mg-poor compared to the composition of bulk Earth. However,
unlike the metal pollutants, H never diffuses out of the atmosphere of white

result from previous accretion of water bearing planetesimals. Comparing the
detection of trace H and metal pollution among 729 helium atmosphere white

highly significant correlation indicates that, over the cooling age of the

most plausible source is water. In this scenario, water must be common in

revealed by the young ages (50-80 Myr) and high contributions to light of young

the geometry of maser amplification pathways, the minority of water maser disks
are observable: only those viewed nearly edge-on have been identified,
suggesting that an order of magnitude additional maser disks exist. We suggest
that inward-propagating masers will be gravitationally deflected by the central
black hole, thereby scattering water maser emission out of the disk plane and
enabling detection. The signature of an inclined water maser disk would be
narrow masers near the systemic velocity that appear to emit from the black
hole position, as identified by the radio continuum core. To explore this
possibility, we present high resolution (0.07""-0.17"") Very Large Array line and

investigate this connection, we analyze galaxies with

simulation Magneticum. We find that the satellite fraction of centrals is
independent of their morphology. With the exception of very massive galaxies at
low redshift, our results do not support the assumption that the dark matter
(DM) haloes of spheroidal galaxies are significantly more massive than those of
disc galaxies at fixed $M_\mathrm{star}$. We show that the
density-morphology-relation starts to build up at $z\sim2$ and is independent
of the star-formation properties of central galaxies. We conclude that
environmental quenching is more important for satellites than for centrals. Our
simulations indicate that conformity is already in place at $z=2$, where
formation redshift and current star-formation rate (SFR) of central and
satellite galaxies correlate. Centrals with low SFRs have formed earlier (at
fixed $M_\mathrm{star}$) while centrals with high SFR formed later, with
typical formation redshifts well in agreement with observations. However, we
confirm the recent observations that the apparent number of satellites of

difference completely originates from the inclusion of companion galaxies, i.e.
galaxies that do not sit in the potential minimum of a DM halo. Thus, due to
the density-morphological-relation the number of satellites is not a good

light curves to improve the detection and characterization of planetary
transits and astrophysical variability. Algorithms like the Trend Filtering
Algorithm (TFA) use simultaneously-observed stars to remove systematic effects,
and binning is used to reduce high-frequency random noise. We present TFAW, a
wavelet-based modified version of TFA. TFAW aims to increase the periodic
signal detection and to return a detrended and denoised signal without
modifying its intrinsic characteristics. We modify TFA's frequency analysis
step adding a Stationary Wavelet Transform filter to perform an initial noise
and outlier removal and increase the detection of variable signals. A wavelet
filter is added to TFA's signal reconstruction to perform an adaptive
characterization of the noise- and trend-free signal and the noise contribution
at each iteration while preserving astrophysical signals. We carried out tests
over simulated sinusoidal and transit-like signals to assess the effectiveness
of the method and applied TFAW to real light curves from TFRM. We also studied
TFAW's application to simulated multiperiodic signals, improving their
characterization. TFAW improves the signal detection rate by increasing the
signal detection efficiency (SDE) up to a factor ~2.5x for low SNR light
curves. For simulated transits, the transit detection rate improves by a factor
~2-5x in the low-SNR regime compared to TFA. TFAW signal approximation performs
up to a factor ~2x better than bin averaging for planetary transits. The
standard deviations of simulated and real TFAW light curves are ~40x better
than TFA. TFAW yields better MCMC posterior distributions and returns lower
uncertainties, less biased transit parameters and narrower (~10x) credibility
intervals for simulated transits. We present a newly-discovered variable star

However, models with substantial atmospheric dust/clouds yield temperatures and
gravities that are consistent when fit to photometry and spectra separately,

inconsistent with ROXS 42B b's $K$-band spectrum and vice-versa. Atmospheric

Unfortunately, $EB$ correlations are much weaker than would be naively
expected, which we show is due to an approximate symmetry resulting from the
two-dimensional nature of the CMB. The detectability of parity-violating
correlations is exacerbated by the fact that the handedness of individual modes
cannot be discerned in the two-dimensional CMB, leading to a noise contribution
from scalar matter perturbations. In contrast, the tidal imprints of primordial
gravity waves fossilized into the large-scale structure of the Universe are a
three-dimensional probe of parity violation. Using such fossils the handedness
of gravity waves may be determined on a mode-by-mode basis, permitting future
surveys to probe helicity at the percent level if the amplitude of primordial
gravity waves is near current observational upper limits.

We present the results of X-ray expansion measurements that illuminate the

2015) of 0.58% per year, but large spatial variations are present. Using the
nonparametric ""Demons"" method, we measure the velocity field throughout the
entire SNR, finding that motions vary by a factor of 5, from 0.09"" to 0.44"" per
year. The slowest shocks are at the outer boundary of the bright northern radio
rim, with velocities $v_s$ as low as 3,600 km/s (for an assumed distance of 8.5
kpc), much less than $v_s = 12,000 - 13,000$ km/s along the X-ray-bright major
axis. Such strong deceleration of the northern blast wave most likely arises
from the collision of SN ejecta with a much denser than average ambient medium
there. This asymmetric ambient medium naturally explains the radio asymmetry.
In several locations, significant morphological changes and strongly nonradial
motions are apparent. The spatially-integrated X-ray flux continues to increase
with time. Based on Chandra observations spanning 8.3 years, we measure its
increase at 1.3% +/- 0.8% per year. The SN ejecta are likely colliding with the

compactness: For any open cover of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$, there is a finite
sub-cover. A natural question is: How hard is it to compute such a finite
sub-cover? We make this precise by analyzing the complexity of functionals that
given any $g:2^{\mathbb{N}}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, output a finite sequence
$\langle f_0 , \dots, f_n\rangle $ in $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ such that the
neighbourhoods defined from $\bar{f_i}g(f_i)$ for $i\leq n$ form a cover of

Robinson's nonstandard compactness, i.e. that every binary sequence is
`infinitely close' to a standard binary sequence. We analyze the strength of
this nonstandard compactness property of Cantor space, compared to the other
axioms of Nonstandard Analysis and usual mathematics.

`holistic' in nature: results in computability theory give rise to results in

fluxes at $\sim0.90-0.95\phi$, just prior to maximum brightness. Previously,
$\delta$ Cep was found as potentially X-ray variable, using XMM-Newton
observations (Engle et al. 2014). Additional phase-constrained data were
secured with Chandra near X-ray emission peak, to determine if the emission and
variability were pulsation-phase-specific to $\delta$ Cep and not transient or
due to a possible coronally-active, cool companion. The Chandra data were
combined with prior XMM-Newton observations, and very closely match the
previously observed X-ray behavior. From the combined dataset, a
$\sim$4$\times$ increase in X-ray flux is measured, reaching a peak $L_X$ = 1.7
$\times$ 10$^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ near 0.45$\phi$. The precise X-ray flux phasing
with the star's pulsation indicates that the emissions arise from the Cepheid
and not a companion. However, it is puzzling that maximum X-ray flux occurs
$\sim$0.5$\phi$ ($\sim$3 days) later than the FUV--UV maximum. There are
several other potential Cepheid X-ray detections with properties similar to
$\delta$ Cep, and comparable X-ray variability is indicated for two other
Cepheids: $\beta$ Dor and V473 Lyr. X-ray generating mechanisms in $\delta$ Cep

Despite several decades of research on this ubiquitous and

Recently, it was realized that all stochastic and deterministic differential
equations, describing all natural and engineered dynamical systems, possess a
topological supersymmetry. It was then suggested that its spontaneous breakdown
could be interpreted as the stochastic generalization of deterministic chaos.
This conclusion stems from the fact that such phenomenon encompasses features
that are traditionally associated with chaotic dynamics such as
non-integrability, positive topological entropy, sensitivity to initial
conditions, and the Poincare-Bendixson theorem. Here, we strengthen and
complete this picture by showing that the hallmarks of set-theoretic chaos --
topological transitivity/mixing and dense periodic orbits -- can also be
attributed to the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry. We also
demonstrate that these features, which highlight the noisy character of chaotic
dynamics, do not actually admit a stochastic generalization. We therefore
conclude that spontaneous topological symmetry breaking can be considered as
the most general definition of continuous-time dynamical chaos. Contrary to the
common perception and semantics of the word ""chaos"", this phenomenon should
then be truly interpreted as the low-symmetry, or ordered phase of the
dynamical systems that manifest it. Since the long-range order in this case is
temporal, we then suggest the word ""chronotaxis"" as a better representation of
this phenomenon.

entire and meromorphic maps. We prove that shell components are simply
connected, have a locally connected boundary and have no center, i.e., no
parameter value for which the cycle is superattracting. Instead, there is a
unique parameter in the boundary, the {\em virtual center}, which plays the
same role. For entire slices, the virtual center is always at infinity, while
for meromorphic ones it maybe finite or infinite. In the dynamical plane we
prove, among other results, that the basins of attraction which contain only
one asymptotic value and no critical points are simply connected. Our dynamical
plane results apply without the restriction of finite type.

is an adaptation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for Hidden Markov Models. This
step provides an estimate of a complete order $k$ Markov chain, where $k$ is
bigger than the order of the variable length Markov chain if it has finite

infinite order. In the second estimation step, we propose a bootstrap Bayesian
Information Criterion, given a sample of the Markov chain estimated in the

Extended Hubbard model is taken at the start, together with longer-range
electron-electron interactions incorporated into the scheme. The stacked
molecular plane transforms discontinuously into a (quasi)atomic state under the
applied force via a two-step transition: the first between molecular insulating
phases and the second from the molecular to the quasiatomic metallic phase. No
quasiatomic insulating phase occurs. All the transitions are accompanied by an
abrupt changes of the bond length and the intermolecular distance (lattice
parameter), as well as by discontinuous changes of the principal electronic
properties, which are characteristic of the Mott-Hubbard transition here
associated with the jumps of the predetermined equilibrium lattice parameter
and the effective bond length. The phase transition can be interpreted in terms
of the solid hydrogen metallization under pressure exerted by e.g., the
substrate covered with a monomolecular $H_2$ film of the vertically stacked

plasmonic systems. Our treatment is intuitive to use and provides fresh
analytical insight into the physics of the Raman scattering near metallic
surfaces and can be applied to a wide range of geometries including resonators,
waveguides, as well as hybrid photonic-plasmonic systems. Our general theory
demonstrates that the detected Raman spectrum originates from an interplay
between nonlinear light generation and propagation. Counter intuitively, at the
nonlinear generation stage, we show that the Stokes (anti-Stokes) signal at the
molecule location depends on the plasmonic enhancements, through the local
density of photon states (LDOS), at the anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency.
However, when propagating from the vibrating molecule to the far field, the
Stokes (anti-Stokes) emission experiences a plasmonic enhancement at the Stokes
(anti-Stokes) frequency, as expected. We identify the limits of the commonly
known E^4 electric-field rule for Raman signal enhancement near plasmonic
surfaces at low pump powers, as well as a different E^8 rule at high pump
powers, and we clarify the role of the LDOS. Our theory uses a generalized
quantum master equation where the plasmonic system is treated as an
environmental bath that is described through the photonic Green function of the
medium. Therefore, any electrodynamics related physics, such as quenching and
propagation, are self-consistently included in the model. The presented
formalism is also capable of spatially describing the full Raman response in a
simple analytical way, which is typically not possible using simpler coupled
mode theories, even if one adopts a quantum picture.

years due to the increasingly popular neural network methods. In this paper, we
explore deep learning techniques for answering multi-step reasoning questions
that operate on semi-structured tables. Challenges here arise from the level of
logical compositionality expressed by questions, as well as the domain
openness. Our approach is weakly supervised, trained on question-answer-table
triples without requiring intermediate strong supervision. It performs two
phases: first, machine understandable logical forms (programs) are generated
from natural language questions following the work of [Pasupat and Liang,
2015]. Second, paraphrases of logical forms and questions are embedded in a
jointly learned vector space using word and character convolutional neural
networks. A neural scoring function is further used to rank and retrieve the
most probable logical form (interpretation) of a question. Our best single
model achieves 34.8% accuracy on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, while the best
ensemble of our models pushes the state-of-the-art score on this task to 38.7%,
thus slightly surpassing both the engineered feature scoring baseline, as well
as the Neural Programmer model of [Neelakantan et al., 2016].

involving both the cyber and physical domains. Their hybrid nature introduces
new attack vectors, but also provides an opportunity to design new security
defenses. In this paper, we present a new domain-specific security mechanism,
FIRED, that leverages physical properties such as inertia of the CPS to improve
security.
  FIRED is simple to describe and implement. It goes through two operations:
Reset and Diversify, as frequently as possible -- typically in the order of
seconds or milliseconds. The combined effect of these operations is that
attackers are unable to gain persistent control of the system. The CPS stays
safe and stable even under frequent resets because of the inertia present.
Further, resets simplify certain diversification mechanisms and makes them
feasible to implement in CPSs with limited computing resources.
  We evaluate our idea on two real-world systems: an engine management unit of
a car and a flight controller of a quadcopter. Roughly speaking, these two
systems provide typical and extreme operational requirements for evaluating
FIRED in terms of stability, algorithmic complexity, and safety requirements.
We show that FIRED provides robust security guarantees against hijacking
attacks and persistent CPS threats. We find that our defense is suitable for
emerging CPS such as commodity unmanned vehicles that are currently unregulated
and cost sensitive.

overall dynamics and large scale flows arising in the convective envelopes of
stars covering stellar spectral types from early G to late K. We do so through
numerical simulations with the ASH code, where we consider stellar convective
envelopes coupled to a radiative interior with various global properties. As
solar-like stars spin down over the course of their main sequence evolution,
such change must have a direct impact on their dynamics and rotation state. We
indeed find that three main states of rotation may exist for a given star:
anti-solar-like (fast poles, slow equator), solar-like (fast equator, slow
poles), or a cylindrical rotation profile. Under increasingly strict rotational
constraints, the latter profile can further evolve into a Jupiter-like profile,
with alternating prograde and retrograde zonal jets. We have further assessed
how far the convection and meridional flows overshoot into the radiative zone
and investigated the morphology of the established tachocline. Using simple
mixing length arguments, we are able to construct a scaling of the fluid Rossby
number $R_{of} = \tilde{\omega}/2\Omega_* \sim \tilde{v}/2\Omega_* R_*$, which
we calibrate based on our 3-D ASH simulations. We can use this scaling to map
the behavior of differential rotation versus the global parameters of stellar
mass and rotation rate. Finally, we isolate a region on this map ($R_{of}
\gtrsim 1.5-2$) where we posit that stars with an anti-solar differential
rotation may exist in order to encourage observers to hunt for such targets.

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) have been extensively deployed in many

However, most of these approaches involve pairwise training data comparisons,
and thus have quadratic computational complexity with respect to the size of
training set, preventing them from scaling to fairly big datasets. Moreover,
during testing, comparing test data against all the training data points is
also expensive in terms of both computational cost and resources required.
Furthermore, previous metrics are either too constrained or too expressive to
be well learned. To effectively solve these issues, we present an
exemplar-centered supervised shallow parametric data embedding model, using a
Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning (MCML) objective. Our strategy learns a
shallow high-order parametric embedding function and compares training/test
data only with learned or precomputed exemplars, resulting in a cost function
with linear computational complexity for both training and testing. We also
empirically demonstrate, using several benchmark datasets, that for
classification in two-dimensional embedding space, our approach not only gains
speedup of kNN by hundreds of times, but also outperforms state-of-the-art

switching of both layers. The influence of different material parameters on the
critical switching currents for the free and pinned layer is obtained by
micromagnetic simulations. It is found that the choice of a free-layer material
with low polarization $\beta$ and saturation magnetization $M_s$, and a
pinned-layer material with high $\beta$ and $M_s$ leads to a low free-layer
critical current and a high pinned-layer critical current and hence reduces the
likelihood of back hopping. While back hopping was observed in various types of

long-standing open problem. The commutative case has been extensively
investigated and fully characterized. We study the non-commutative case. Given
a weight function $\omega$ on a locally compact group $G$, we characterize
derivations from $L^1(G,\omega)$ into its dual in terms of certain functions.
Then we show that for a locally compact IN group $G$, if there is a non-zero
continuous group homomorphism $\varphi$: $G\to \mathbb{C}$ such that
$\varphi(x)/\omega(x)\omega(x^{-1})$ is bounded on $G$, then $L^1(G,\omega)$ is
not weakly amenable. Some useful criteria that rule out weak amenability of
$L^1(G,\omega)$ are established. Using them we show that for many polynomial
type weights the weighted Heisenberg group algebra is not weakly amenable,
neither is the weighted $\boldsymbol{ax+b}$ group algebra. We further study
weighted quotient group algebra $L^1(G/H,\hat\omega)$, where $\hat\omega$ is
the canonical weight on $G/H$ induced by $\omega$. We reveal that the kernel of
the canonical homomorphism from $L^1(G,\omega)$ to $L^1(G/H,\hat\omega)$ is
complemented. This allows us to obtain some sufficient conditions under which
$L^1(G/H,\hat\omega)$ inherits weak amenability of $L^1(G,\omega)$. We study
further weak amenability of Beurling algebras of subgroups. In general, weak
amenability of a Beurling algebra does not pass to the Beurling algebra of a
subgroup. However, in some circumstances this inheritance can happen. We also
give an example to show that weak amenability of both $L^1(H,\omega|_H)$ and

geometries of metal ion complexes. Despite their critical importance for
understanding the magnetism and spectroscopy of metal complexes, they are not
routinely available through general laboratory-based techniques, and are often
inferred from magnetism data. Here we demonstrate a simple tabletop
experimental approach that enables direct and reliable determination of ZFS
parameters in the terahertz (THz) regime. We report time-domain measurements of
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals associated with THz-frequency
ZFSs in molecular complexes containing high-spin transition-metal ions. We
measure the temporal profiles of the free-induction decays of spin resonances
in the complexes at zero and nonzero external magnetic fields, and we derive
the EPR spectra via numerical Fourier transformation of the time-domain
signals. In most cases, absolute values of the ZFS parameters are extracted
from the measured zero-field EPR frequencies, and the signs can be determined
by zero-field measurements at two different temperatures. Field-dependent EPR
measurements further allow refined determination of the ZFS parameters and
access to the g-factor. The results show good agreement with those obtained by
other methods. The simplicity of the method portends wide applicability in
chemistry, biology and material science.

  Spinrad","Double Threshold Digraphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A semiorder is a model of preference relations where each element $x$ is
associated with a utility value $\alpha(x)$, and there is a threshold $t$ such
that $y$ is preferred to $x$ iff $\alpha(y) > \alpha(x)+t$. These are motivated
by the notion that there is some uncertainty in the utility values we assign an
object or that a subject may be unable to distinguish a preference between
objects whose values are close. However, they fail to model the well-known
phenomenon that preferences are not always transitive. Also, if we are
uncertain of the utility values, it is not logical that preference is
determined absolutely by a comparison of them with an exact threshold. We
propose a new model in which there are two thresholds, $t_1$ and $t_2$; if the
difference $\alpha(y) - \alpha(x)$ less than $t_1$, then $y$ is not preferred
to $x$; if the difference is greater than $t_2$ then $y$ is preferred to $x$;
if it is between $t_1$ and $t_2$, then then $y$ may or may not be preferred to
$x$. We call such a relation a double-threshold semiorder, and the
corresponding directed graph $G = (V,E)$ a double threshold digraph. Every
directed acyclic graph is a double threshold graph; bounds on $t_2/t_1$ give a
nested hierarchy of subclasses of the directed acyclic graphs. In this paper we
characterize the subclasses in terms of forbidden subgraphs, and give
algorithms for finding an assignment of of utility values that explains the
relation in terms of a given $(t_1,t_2)$ or else produces a forbidden subgraph,
and finding the minimum value $\lambda$ of $t_2/t_1$ that is satisfiable for a
given directed acyclic graph. We show that $\lambda$ gives a measure of the
complexity of a directed acyclic graph with respect to several optimization
problems that are NP-hard on arbitrary directed acyclic graphs.

the authors observe a net charge transfer from the molecule to the Co substrate

phenomenon to the energy band shifts due to the image charge potential.

ENS. 52 (2019) 1201-1242",,,"math.GR math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the notion of sublinearly bilipschitz equivalences (SBE), which
generalize quasi-isometries, allowing some additional terms that behave
sublinearly with respect to the distance from the origin. Such maps were
originally motivated by the fact they induce bilipschitz homeomorphisms between
asymptotic cones. We prove here that for hyperbolic groups, they also induce
H\""older homeomorphisms between the boundaries. This yields many basic examples
of hyperbolic groups that are pairwise non-SBE. Besides, we check that
subexponential growth is an SBE-invariant.
  The central part of the paper addresses nilpotent groups. While
classification up to sublinearly bilipschitz equivalence is known in this case
as a consequence of Pansu's theorems, its quantitative version is not. We
introduce a computable algebraic invariant $e=e_G<1$ for every such group $G$,
and check that $G$ is $O(r^e)$-bilipschitz equivalent to its associated Carnot
group. Here $r\mapsto r^e$ is a quantitive sublinear bound.
  Finally, we define the notion of large-scale contractable and large-scale
homothetic metric spaces. We check that these notions imply polynomial growth
under general hypotheses, and formulate conjectures about groups with these
properties.

size in a predictable fashion. In particular, indicators of social and economic
productivity are expected to have a superlinear relation. This behavior was
verified for many urban systems, but recent findings suggest that this pattern
may not be valid for England and Wales (E&W), where income has a linear
relation with city size. This finding raises the question of whether the cities
of E&W exhibit any superlinear relation with respect to quantities such as the
level of education and occupational groups. In this paper, we evaluate the
scaling of educational and occupational groups of E&W to see if we can detect
superlinear relations in the number of educated and better-paid persons. As E&W
may be unique in its linear scaling of income, we complement our analysis by
comparing it to the urban system of the United States (US), a country for which
superlinear scaling of income has already been demonstrated. To make the two
urban systems comparable, we define the urban systems of both countries using
the same method and test the sensitivity of our results to changes in the
boundaries of cities. We find that cities of E&W exhibit patterns of
superlinear scaling with respect to education and certain categories of
better-paid occupations. However, the tendency of such groups to have
superlinear scaling seems to be more consistent in the US. We show that while
the educational and occupational distributions of US cities can partly explain
the superlinear scaling of earnings, the distribution leads to a linear scaling
of earnings in E&W.

by photon-multiplier (PMT) detector and held by the pulse-holding circuits,
which are then sampled by the analog-to-digit convertor (ADC) with finite
sampling rate and counted by a rising-edge pulse detector. However, the finite
small pulse width incurs the dead time effect that may lead to sub-Poisson
distribution on the recorded pulses. We analyze first-order and second-order
moments on the number of recorded pulses with finite sampling rate at the
receiver side under two cases where the sampling period is shorter than or
equal to the pulse width as well as longer than the pulse width. Moreover, we
adopt the maximum likelihood (ML) detection. In order to simplify the analysis,
we adopt binomial distribution approximation on the number of recorded pulses
in each slot. A tractable holding time and decision threshold selection rule is
provided aiming to maximize the minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between
the two distributions. The performance of proposed sub-Poisson distribution and
the binomial approximation are verified by the experimental results. The
equivalent arrival rate and holding time predicted by the of sub-Poisson model
and the associated proposed binomial distribution on finite sampling rate and
the electrical noise are validated by the simulation results. The proposed the
holding time and decision threshold selection rule performs close to the
optimal one.

concentrated, there are some modes which produce electrons and positrons as
final products, and we categorize them into two components. One of them is the
""Line"" component, which directly annihilates into electron--positron pair.
Another one is the ""Continuum"" component, which consists of secondarily
produced electrons and positrons via some decay modes. Before reaching Earth,
directions of electrons and positrons are randomized by the Galactic magnetic
field, and their energies are reduced by energy loss mechanisms. We assume the
LKP is in the mass range from 300 GeV to 1500 GeV. We calculate the electron
plus positron spectrum after propagation in the Galactic halo to Earth, and we
analyze the resulting spectrum and positron fraction. We also point out that
the energy dependence of observed positron fraction is well reproduced by the

positron spectrum and the positron fraction by assuming appropriate boost
factors describing dark matter concentration in the Galactic halo. However, it
is difficult to explain both the electron plus positron spectrum and the
positron fraction by a single boost factor, if we take account of observational
data obtained by AMS-02 only.

Relativity, which questions the reliability of the FLRW model. The long
standing issue of the importance of backreactions induced by cosmic
inhomogeneities is addressed for a toy model assuming a peak in the primordial
spectrum of density perturbations and a simple CDM cosmology. The backreactions
of initial Hubble-size inhomogeneities are determined in a fully relativistic
framework, from a series of simulations using the BSSN formalism of numerical
relativity. In the FLRW picture, these backreactions can be effectively
described by two so-called morphon scalar fields, one of them acting at late
time like a tiny cosmological constant. Initial density contrasts ranging from
$10^{-2}$ down to $10^{-4}$, on scales crossing the Hubble radius between
$z\sim 45 $ and $z\sim 1000$ respectively, i.e. comoving gigaparsec scales,
mimic a Dark Energy (DE) component that can reach $\Omega_{\mathrm{DE}} \approx
0.7$ when extrapolated until today. A similar effect is not excluded for lower
density contrasts but our results are then strongly contaminated by numerical
noise and thus hardly reliable. A potentially detectable signature of this
scenario is a phantom-like equation of state $w< -1$, at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4$
for a density contrast of $10^{-2}$ initially, relaxing slowly to $w \approx
-1$ today. This new class of scenarios would send the fine-tuning and
coincidence issues of Dark energy back to the mechanism at the origin of the
primordial power spectrum enhancement, possibly in the context of inflation.

minimum box dimension which accommodates an unstable sediment bed is revealed,
thus determining the lower threshold of the unstable modes. For the considered
parameter point, the cutoff length for pattern formation lies in the range
75-100 particle diameters (3-4 times the clear fluid height). We also simulate
the flow in a very long streamwise box with a size of 48 times the clear fluid
height (featuring over one million particles), accommodating approximately 11
initial ripple units with a wavelength of 100-110 particle diameters. The
amplitude of the patterns exhibits two regimes of growth: an initial
exponential regime, with a growth rate independent of the chosen domain size,
and a subsequent non-linear regime which is strongly constrained by the domain
length. In the small domain cases, after the initial exponential regime, the
ripples evolve steadily maintaining their shape and migration velocity, at a
mean wavelength equal to the length of the domain. The asymmetric ripple shape
is characterized by a spectrum which exhibits a power-law decay over the first
few dominant non-dispersive modes propagating at the mean dune migration
velocity. The particle flowrate and the mean interface shear stress exhibited
an increase with increasing ripple dimensions. Nevertheless, the relationship
between the two was observed to be approximately described by the empirical

the interfacial layer forming an interfacial conductive state with

order to achieve our goal, we investigate the structure of evaluation

related by what we call projected isomorphisms. These isomorphisms are used to
construct a set of quadratic functional relations, called $\psi$-system, for
the solutions to complex differential equations associated to $\hat{\mathfrak

be generalised to the sinh-Gordon model. In doing so we give an interpretation
of the fermionic basis in terms of certain symmetries of the system. This new

Interestingly, tunneling between these two displaced oscillators can induce an
anti-polaron, which has not been systematically explored in the literature,
especially in the presence of an asymmetric term. In this paper, we present a
systematic analysis of the competition between the polaron and anti-polaron
under the interplay of the coupling strength and the asymmetric term. While
intuitively the anti-polaron should be secondary owing to its higher potential
energy, we find that, under certain conditions, the minor anti-polaron may gain
a reversal in the weight over the major polaron. If the asymmetric amplitude
$\epsilon$ is smaller than the harmonic frequency $\omega$, such an
overweighted anti-polaron can occur beyond a critical value of the coupling
strength $g$; if $\epsilon$ is larger, the anti-polaron can even be always
overweighted at any $g$. We propose that the explicit occurrence of the
overweighted anti-polaron can be monitored by a displacement transition from
negative to positive values. This displacement is an experimentally accessible
observable, which can be measured by quantum optical methods, such as balanced
Homodyne detection.

making reliable inferences and forecasts. Such inferences are crucial to
understand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or
control the outbreak. However, construction of such line lists requires
considerable human supervision and therefore, difficult to generate in
real-time. In this paper, we motivate Guided Deep List, the first tool for
building automated line lists (in near real-time) from open source reports of
emerging disease outbreaks. Specifically, we focus on deriving epidemiological
characteristics of an emerging disease and the affected population from reports
of illness. Guided Deep List uses distributed vector representations (ala

discovery of indicators is followed by the use of dependency parsing based
techniques for final extraction in tabular form. We evaluate the performance of
Guided Deep List against a human annotated line list provided by HealthMap
corresponding to MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. We demonstrate that Guided
Deep List extracts line list features with increased accuracy compared to a

occurrences in the solar atmosphere could provide a tool to estimate the
longitudinal position of the most probable CME-capable active regions in the
Sun. The anomaly in the longitudinal distribution of active regions themselves
is often referred to as active longitude (AL). In order to reveal the
connection between the AL and CME spatial occurrences, here we investigate the
morphological properties of active regions. The first morphological property
studied is the separateness parameter, which is able to characterize the
probability of the occurrence of an energetic event, such as a solar flare or
CME. The second morphological property is the sunspot tilt angle. The tilt
angle of sunspot groups allows us to estimate the helicity of active regions.
The increased helicity leads to a more complex buildup of the magnetic
structure and also can cause CME eruption. We found that the most complex
active regions appear near the AL and that the AL itself is associated with the
most tilted active regions. Therefore, the number of CME occurrences is higher
within the AL. The origin of the fast CMEs is also found to be associated with
this region. We concluded that the source of the most probably CME-capable
active regions is at the AL. By applying this method, we can potentially
forecast a flare and/or CME source several Carrington rotations in advance.
This finding also provides new information for solar dynamo modeling.

respond to large, complex patterns of retinal flow, implying a role in the
analysis of self-motion. Some neurons are selective for the expanding radial
motion that occurs as an observer moves through the environment (""heading""),
and computational models can account for this finding. However, ample evidence
suggests that MSTd neurons may exhibit a continuum of visual response
selectivity to large-field motion stimuli, but the underlying computational
principles by which these response properties are derived remain poorly
understood. Here we describe a computational model of MSTd based on the
hypothesis that neurons in MSTd efficiently encode the continuum of large-field
retinal flow patterns on the basis of inputs received from neurons in MT, with
receptive fields that resemble basis vectors recovered with nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF). These assumptions are sufficient to quantitatively
simulate neurophysiological response properties of MSTd cells such as radial,
circular, and spiral motion tuning, suggesting that these properties might
simply be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on
their inputs. At the population level, model MSTd accurately predicts heading
using a sparse distributed code, consistent with the idea that biological MSTd
might operate in a sparseness regime well-suited to efficiently encode a number
of self-motion variables. The present work provides an alternative to the
template-model view of MSTd, and offers a biologically plausible account of the
receptive field structure across a wide range of visual response properties in
MSTd.

basic question has received comparatively little attention: how desirable are
cascades on a social media platform from the point of view of users? While

gap by providing a consumer perspective of cascade.
  Users on online networks play the dual role of producers and consumers.
First, we perform an empirical study of the interaction of Twitter users with
retweet cascades. We measure how often users observe retweets in their home
timeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the ""Impressions Paradox"": the
share of impressions for cascades of size k decays much slower than frequency
of cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even
for rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet
cascades in comparison to non-retweeted content. Our results show that cascades
often rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression.
This result is perhaps surprising in that consumers didn't opt in to see tweets
from these authors. Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular,
one would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be
interested in the content. Motivated by our findings, we posit a theoretical
model that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience. Our results on
this model highlight the balance between retweeting as a high-quality content
selection mechanism and the role of network users in filtering irrelevant
content.

star-forming (SF) galaxies at z<0.3. Gas and stellar velocity dispersions are
comparable to each other in SF galaxies, indicating that the ionized gas
kinematics can be accounted by the gravitational potential of host galaxies. In
contrast, AGNs clearly show non-gravitational kinematics, which is comparable
to or stronger than the virial motion caused by the gravitational potential.
The [OIII] velocity-velocity dispersion (VVD) diagram dramatically expands
toward high values as a function of AGN luminosity, implying that the outflows
are AGN-driven, while SF galaxies do not show such a trend. We find that the
fraction of AGNs with a signature of outflow kinematics, steeply increases with
AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. In particular, the majority of luminous
AGNs presents strong non-gravitational kinematics in the [OIII] profile. AGNs
with strong outflow signatures show on average similar specific star formation
rate (SSFR) to that of starforming galaxies. In contrast, AGNs with weak or no
outflows have an order of magnitude lower SSFR, suggesting that AGNs with

automatically detects the equivalence modulo states among a statement and its
mutations, then groups the statements into equivalence classes modulo states,

SPDC process [1]. Such effect is used in this paper for demonstration of
non-classical dispersion cancellation phenomenon in both local and nonlocal
detections, theoretically. The following results are analytically achieved: I)
For local detection, if narrow pump laser (highly entangled photons) are used,
the dispersive broadening cancelation is directly depends on the degree of
entanglement. The higher entanglement degree, the more compensation occurs. The
results indicate that by increasing the FWHM of the pump the impact of the
entanglement degree is decreased in such a way that for a pump with FWHM=4 nm
the entanglement has no effect on the broadening. Therefore, the dispersive
broadening is only depends on the temporal walk-off between generated photon
pairs and the pump. II) For nonlocal detection, it is also shown that
entanglement cancels the dispersive broadening if and only if each of the
generated paired photons propagate through dispersive material with identical
length with opposite group velocity sign.

power systems is serious due to the increasing load demand, the increasing use
of electronically controlled loads and so on. Some serious blackouts are
considered to be related to short-term voltage instability. In China, the East
China Grid (ECG) is especially vulnerable to short-term voltage instability due
the its increasing dependence on power injection from external grids through
HVDC links. However, the SVS criteria used in practice are all qualitative and
the SVS indices proposed in previous researches are mostly based on the
qualitative SVS criteria. So a Short-Term Voltage Stability Index (SVSI), which
is continuous, quantitative and multi-dimensional, is proposed in this paper.
The SVSI consists of three components, which reflects the transient voltage
restoration, the transient voltage oscillation and the steady-state recovery
ability of the voltage signal respectively after the contingency has been
cleared. The theoretical backgrounds and affected factors of these three
components of SVSI are analyzed, together with some feasible applications. The
verification of the validity of SVSI are tested through more 10,000 cases based
on ECG. Additionally, a simple case of selecting candidate locations to install
dynamic var using SVSI is presented to show its feasibility to solve the
optimization problem for dynamic var allocation.

that, compared with tuning by external electric-fields, strain or doping by

a carrier-mixed Dirac state can be obtained. We corroborate that the Dirac

better classification than the nearest neighbor approach. However, the shapelet
discovery process requires the evaluation of all possible subsequences of all

Consequently, shapelet discovery for large time series datasets quickly becomes
intractable. A number of improvements have been proposed to reduce the training

reduced classification accuracy compared to the exact method.
  We are proposing the use of ensembles of shapelet-based classifiers obtained

section for the inverse process where two protons are liberated from the
borromean nucleus by photon bombardment. We find a number of peaks at low
photon energy in this cross section where each peak is located at the energy
corresponding to population of a three-body resonance. Thus, for these energies
the decay or capture processes proceed through these resonances. However, the
next step in the dissociation process still has the option of following several
paths, that is either sequential decay by emission of one proton at a time with
an intermediate two-body resonance as stepping stone, or direct decay into the
continuum of both protons simultaneously. The astrophysical reaction rate is
obtained by folding of the cross section as function of energy with the
occupation probability for a Maxwell-Boltzmann temperature distribution. The
reaction rate is then a function of temperature, and of course depending on the
underlying three-body bound state and resonance structures. We show that a very
simple formula at low temperature reproduces the elaborate numerically computed
reaction rate.

the skyrmions causes an inhomogeneous emergent magnetic field whose associated
Lorentz force acts on the electrons. By making the emergent field homogeneous,
the THE is mapped onto the quantum Hall effect (QHE). Consequently, each
electronic band of the SkX is assigned to a Landau level. This correspondence
of THE and QHE allows to explain the unconventional behavior of the THE of
electrons in SkXs. For example, a skyrmion crystal on a triangular lattice
exhibits a quantized topological Hall conductivity with steps of $2 \cdot
e^2/h$ below and with steps of $1 \cdot e^2/h$ above the van Hove singularity.
On top of this, the conductivity shows a prominent sign change at the van Hove
singularity. These unconventional features are deeply connected to the topology
of the structural lattice.

intra coding, and then up-sampled to its original resolution. Different from
previous studies on down/up-sampling-based coding, the up-sampling methods in
our scheme have been designed by training CNN instead of hand-crafted. We
explore a new CNN structure for up-sampling, which features deconvolution of
feature maps, multi-scale fusion, and residue learning, making the network both
compact and efficient. We also design different networks for the up-sampling of
luma and chroma components, respectively, where the chroma up-sampling CNN
utilizes the luma information to boost its performance. In addition, we design
a two-stage up-sampling process, the first stage being within the
block-by-block coding loop, and the second stage being performed on the entire
frame, so as to refine block boundaries. We also empirically study how to set
the coding parameters of down-sampled blocks for pursuing the frame-level
rate-distortion optimization. Our proposed scheme is implemented into the High
Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) reference software, and a comprehensive set of
experiments have been performed to evaluate our methods. Experimental results
show that our scheme achieves significant bits saving compared with HEVC anchor
especially at low bit rates, leading to on average 5.5% BD-rate reduction on
common test sequences and on average 9.0% BD-rate reduction on ultra high

the equivalence of the structures: (a) Lorentz-Finsler manifold for which the

indicatrix (observer space) at each point is a convex hyperbolic affine sphere
centered on the zero section, and (c) pair given by a spacetime volume and a
sharp convex cone distribution. The equivalence suggests to describe {\em
(affine sphere) spacetimes} with this structure, so that no algebraic-metrical
concept enters the definition. As a result, this work shows how the metric
features of spacetime emerge from elementary concepts such as measure and
order. Non-relativistic spacetimes are obtained replacing proper spheres with
improper spheres, so the distinction does not call for group theoretical
elements. In physical terms, in affine sphere spacetimes the light cone
distribution and the spacetime measure determine the motion of massive and
massless particles (hence the dispersion relation). Furthermore, it is shown
that, more generally, for Lorentz-Finsler theories non-differentiable at the
cone, the lightlike geodesics and the transport of the particle momentum over
them are well defined though the curve parametrization could be undefined.
Causality theory is also well behaved. Several results for affine sphere
spacetimes are presented. Some results in Finsler geometry, for instance in the
characterization of Randers spaces, are also included.

all observers agree on the spacetime volume. They have necessarily affine

emitted by a point would observe, respectively, an expanding (a) sphere, (b)

environmental and internal system factors to measure the overall risk at any
moment in time, to decide whether behaviours such as fleeing or hiding are
necessary, or whether the system should continue on its task. We integrated our

a drone and evaluated its effectiveness through systematic testing in a

self-preservation increases the distance between the drone and the rover for

up with the rover. Our study demonstrates the benefits of embedding risk
awareness and self-preservation into autonomous systems to increase their
robustness, and the value of using bio-inspired engineering to find solutions

potential and velocity of the clock according to general relativity.
Technological advances in manufacturing high-precision atomic clocks have
rapidly improved their accuracy and stability over the last decade that
approached the level of 10$^{-18}$. Based on a fully relativistic description
of the background gravitational physics, we discuss the impact of those
highly-precise clocks on the realization of reference frames and time scales
used in geodesy. We discuss the current definitions of basic geodetic concepts
and come to the conclusion that the advances in clocks and other metrological
technologies will soon require the re-definition of time scales or, at least,
clarification to ensure their continuity and consistent use in practice. The
relative frequency shift between two clocks is directly related to the
difference in the values of the gravity potential at the points of clock's
localization. According to general relativity the relative accuracy of clocks
in 10$^{-18}$ is equivalent to measuring the gravitational red shift effect
between two clocks with the height difference amounting to 1 cm. We show how
clock measurements can provide geopotential numbers for the realization of
gravity-field-related height systems and can resolve discrepancies in
classically-determined height systems as well as between national height
systems. Another application of clocks is the direct use of observed potential
differences for the improved recovery of regional gravity field solutions.
Finally, clock measurements for space-borne gravimetry are analyzed along with
closely-related deficiencies of this method like an extra-ordinary knowledge of
the spacecraft velocity, etc. For all these applications besides the
near-future prospects, we also discuss the challenges that are related to using
those novel clock data in geodesy.

The evolution trends in baryonic and dark matter are similar, while moderate
differences are observed. Sheets appeared early and their large scale pattern
may have been set up by $z=3$. In term of mass, filaments superseded sheets as
the primary collapsing structures at $z\sim2-3$. Tenuous filaments assembled
with each other to form prominent ones at $z<~2$. In accordance with the
construction of the frame of sheets, the cosmic divergence velocity, $v_{div}$,
had been well developed above 2-3 Mpc by z=3. Afterwards, curl velocity,
$v_{curl}$, grown dramatically along with the rising of filaments, become
comparable to $v_{div}$, for $<2-3 Mpc$ at $z=0$. The scaling of $v_{curl}$ can
be described by the hierarchical turbulence model. The alignment between
vorticity and eigenvectors of shear tensor in baryonic matter field resembles
dark matter, and is even moderately stronger between $\vec{\omega}$ and
$\vec{e}_1$, and $\vec{e}_3$. Compared with dark matter, mildly less baryonic
matter is found residing in filaments and clusters, and its vorticity has been
developed more significantly below $2-3 Mpc$. These differences may be
underestimated due to the limited resolution and lack of star formation in our
simulation. The impact of the change of dominant structures in over-dense
regions at $z\sim2-3$ on galaxy formation and evolution is shortly discussed.

free-fermion coupling $\Gamma\equiv\beta e^2=2$ and then, by using a mapping of
the 2D one-component plasma onto an anticommuting field theory formulated on a

Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Today we know that AGNs are powered by the accretion of
inter stellar material into the gravitational field of a Super Massive Black
Hole and that this process can release as much power as a whole galaxy, like
the Milky Way, from a region that is comparable to the Solar System in size.
Depending on the properties of the central energy source, a large fraction of
this power can be involved in the acceleration of magnetized plasmas at
relativistic speeds, to form large scale jets. The presence of jets affects the
spectrum of AGNs through the emission of synchrotron radiation and Inverse
Compton scattering of low energy photons, thus leading to a prominent
non-thermal spectrum, some times extending from radio frequencies all the way
up to $\gamma$-ray energies. Here we review some characteristic processes of
radiation emission in AGN jets, which lead to the emission of photons in the
radio, optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands, and we present the results of a
spectroscopic campaign of optical counterparts. We discuss our observations and
their connection with $\gamma$-ray properties in a scenario that traces the
role of relativistic jets in different classes of AGNs, detected both in the
local as well as in the remote Universe.

flow in a fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above, were conducted
to investigate the effect of mixed insulating and conducting boundary
conditions on convective flows. Rayleigh numbers between $\text{Ra}=10^7$ and
$\text{Ra}=10^9$ were considered, for Prandtl numbers $\text{Pr}=1$ and
$\text{Pr}=10$. The bottom plate was divided into patterns of conducting and
insulating stripes. The size ratio between these stripes was fixed to unity and
the total number of stripes was varied. Global quantities such as the heat
transport and average bulk temperature and local quantities such as the
temperature just below the insulating boundary wall were investigated. For the
case with the top boundary divided into two halves, one conducting and one
insulating, the heat transfer was found to be approximately two thirds of the
fully conducting case. Increasing the pattern frequency increased the heat
transfer which asymptotically approached the fully conducting case, even if
only half of the surface is conducting. Fourier analysis of the temperature
field revealed that the imprinted pattern of the plates is diffused in the
thermal boundary layers, and cannot be detected in the bulk. With
conducting-insulating patterns on both plates, the trends previously described
were similar, however, the half-and-half division led to a heat transfer of
about a half of the fully conducting case instead of two-thirds. The effect of
the ratio of conducting and insulating areas was also analyzed, and it was
found that even for systems with a top plate with only $25\%$ conducting
surface, heat-transport of $60\%$ of the fully conducting case can be seen.
Changing the 1D stripe pattern to 2D checkerboard tessellations does not result
in a significantly different response of the system.

problems. It has proved to be applicable to problems which occur, for example,
in the geosciences. In the early publications [Fischer2011] and
[FischerMichel2012], it was shown that the iteration converges in the
unregularized case to an exact solution. In [Michel2015] and
[MichelTelschow2016], it was later shown (for two different scenarios) that the
iteration also converges in the regularized case, where the limit of the
iteration is the solution of the Tikhonov-regularized normal equation. However,
the condition of these convergence proofs cannot be satisfied and, therefore,
has to be weakened, as it was pointed out for the convergence theorem of the
related iterated Regularized Orthogonal Functional Matching Pursuit (ROFMP)
algorithm in [MichelTelschow2016]. Moreover, the convergence proof in
[Michel2015] contained a minor error. For these reasons, we reformulate here
the convergence theorem for the RFMP and its proof. We also use this
opportunity to extend the algorithm for an arbitrary infinite-dimensional
separable Hilbert space setting. In addition, we particularly elaborate the
cases of non-injective and non-surjective operators.

soluble.
  Furthermore, we explore the problem and related questions also for other

creating new possibilities to reveal the group structure of high-dimensional
data in the presence of noise variables. Utilising projections onto a space
spanned by a selection of a small number of observations allows measuring the
similarity of other observations to the selection based on orthogonal and score
distances. Observations are iteratively exchanged from the selection creating a
non-random sequence of projections which we call guided projections. In
contrast to conventional projection pursuit methods, which typically identify a
low-dimensional projection revealing some interesting features contained in the
data, guided projections generate a series of projections that serve as a basis
not just for diagnostic plots but to directly investigate the group structure
in data. Based on simulated data we identify the strengths and limitations of
guided projections in comparison to commonly employed data transformation
methods. We further show the relevance of the transformation by applying it to
real-world data sets.

object 1ES 1741+196 in the very high energy (VHE: E$>$100 GeV) band. This
object lies in a triplet of interacting galaxies. Early predictions had
suggested 1ES 1741+196 to be, along with several other high-frequency BL Lac
sources, within the reach of MAGIC detectability. Its detection by MAGIC, later
confirmed by VERITAS, helps to expand the small population of known TeV BL
Lacs. The source was observed with the MAGIC telescopes between 2010 April and
2011 May, collecting 46 h of good quality data. These observations led to the
detection of the source at 6.0 $\sigma$ confidence level, with a steady flux
$\mathrm{F}(> 100 {\rm GeV}) = (6.4 \pm 1.7_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm
2.6_{\mathrm{syst}}) \cdot 10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a differential
spectral photon index $\Gamma = 2.4 \pm 0.2_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm
0.2_{\mathrm{syst}}$ in the range of $\sim$80 GeV - 3 TeV. To study the
broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) simultaneous with MAGIC
observations, we use KVA, Swift/UVOT and XRT, and Fermi/LAT data. One-zone
synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) modeling of the SED of 1ES 1741+196 suggests
values for the SSC parameters that are quite common among known TeV BL Lacs
except for a relatively low Doppler factor and slope of electron energy
distribution. A thermal feature seen in the SED is well matched by a giant
elliptical's template. This appears to be the signature of thermal emission
from the host galaxy, which is clearly resolved in optical observations.

to investigate the effect of Sr doping on a tailor-made compound of composition
La(0.7)Sr(0.3)Mn(0.1)Ti(0.3)Ga(0.6)O(3). By the simultaneous doping with Sr2+
and Ti4+ ions the compound remains in the insulating state, so that the
magnetic interactions for large Sr doping can be studied in the absence of

transition from the trigonal R-3c structure to the orthorhombic Pnma structure
via an intermediate virtual configuration described by the common monoclinic

evidence for two different nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange
interactions, in contrast to the undoped compound LaMnyA(1-y)O(3) where both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are present. The doping
induced changes of the exchange coupling originates from different Mn-O-Mn bond
angles determined by neutron diffraction. The large fourth-nearest-neighbor
interaction found for metallic manganites is absent in the insulating state. We
argue that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction reasonably accounts

ground-truth dataset, to supply both the photospheric information, and to
perform the validation of the data-driven method. We focus our investigation on
how the data-driven model accuracy depends on the temporal frequency of the
driving data. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on NASA's Solar {\jl

a 12 minute cadence. Using our framework we show that ARs that emerge over 25
hours can be modeled by the data-driving method with only $\sim$1\% error in
the free magnetic energy, assuming the photospheric information is specified
every 12 minutes. However, for rapidly evolving features, under-sampling of the
dynamics at this cadence leads to a strobe effect, generating large electric
currents and incorrect coronal morphology and energies. We derive a sampling
condition for the driving cadence based on the evolution of these small-scale
features, and show that higher-cadence driving can lead to acceptable errors.
Future work will investigate the source of errors associated with deriving
plasma variables from the photospheric magnetograms as well as other sources of

guaranteed contracts in online advertising, which are an alternative sales
mechanism to real-time auctions. An advertising option is a contract which
gives its buyer a right but not obligation to enter into transactions to
purchase page views or link clicks at one or multiple pre-specified prices in a
specific future period. Different from typical guaranteed contracts, the option
buyer pays a lower upfront fee but can have greater flexibility and more
control of advertising. Many studies on advertising options so far have been
restricted to the situations where the option payoff is determined by the
underlying spot market price at a specific time point and the price evolution
over time is assumed to be continuous. The former leads to a biased calculation
of option payoff and the latter is invalid empirically for many online
advertising slots. This paper addresses these two limitations by proposing a
new advertising option pricing framework. First, the option payoff is
calculated based on an average price over a specific future period. Therefore,
the option becomes path-dependent. The average price is measured by the power
mean, which contains several existing option payoff functions as its special
cases. Second, jump-diffusion stochastic models are used to describe the
movement of the underlying spot market price, which incorporate several
important statistical properties including jumps and spikes, non-normality, and
absence of autocorrelations. A general option pricing algorithm is obtained
based on Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, an explicit pricing formula is
derived for the case when the option payoff is based on the geometric mean.
This pricing formula is also a generalized version of several other option
pricing models discussed in related studies.

and directly influenced by the QCP. However, experimentally unconventional
superconductivity has neither been established nor directly been linked to any
mechanism of the QCP. Here we report measurements in the heavy-fermion
superconductors CeIrSi$_3$ and CeRhSi$_3$. The measurements were performed with
a newly developed system, first of its kind, that allows high-resolution
studies of the superconducting gap structure under pressure. Superconductivity
in CeIrSi$_3$ shows a change from an excitation spectrum with a line-nodal gap
to one which is entirely gapful when pressure is close but not yet at the QCP.
In contrast, CeRhSi$_3$ does not possess an obvious pressure-tuned QCP and the
superconducting phase remains for all accessible pressures with a nodal gap.
Combining both results suggests that unconventional behaviours may be connected
with the coexisting antiferromagnetic order. This study provides a new
viewpoint on the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism in SCES.

single/multiple unimodular waveforms/codes with good auto- and
cross-correlation or weighted correlation properties, which are highly desired
in radar and communication systems. The waveform design is based on the
minimization of the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and weighted ISL (WISL) of
waveforms. As the corresponding optimization problems can quickly grow to large
scale with increasing the code length and number of waveforms, the main issue
turns to be the development of fast large-scale optimization techniques. The
difficulty is also that the corresponding optimization problems are non-convex,
but the required accuracy is high. Therefore, we formulate the ISL and WISL
minimization problems as non-convex quartic optimization problems in frequency
domain, and then simplify them into quadratic problems by utilizing the
majorization-minimization technique, which is one of the basic techniques for
addressing large-scale and/or non-convex optimization problems. While designing
our fast algorithms, we find out and use inherent algebraic structures in the
objective functions to rewrite them into quartic forms, and in the case of WISL
minimization, to derive additionally an alternative quartic form which allows
to apply the quartic-quadratic transformation. Our algorithms are applicable to
large-scale unimodular waveform design problems as they are proved to have
lower or comparable computational burden (analyzed theoretically) and faster
convergence speed (confirmed by comprehensive simulations) than the

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities are studied in a reduced model that
captures the essential physics driving or damping the modes through variations
in the magnetic shear. The drift-kinetic orbital interaction of a slowing down
distribution of trapped energetic ions with a resistive MHD instability is
integrated to a scalar contribution to the perturbed pressure, and entered into
an asymptotic matching formalism for the resistive MHD dispersion relation.
Toroidal magnetic field line curvature is included to model trapping in the
particle distribution, in an otherwise cylindrical model. The focus is on a
configuration that is driven unstable to the m/n = 2/1 mode by increasing
pressure, where m is the poloidal mode number and n the toroidal. The particles
and pressure can affect the mode both in the core region where there can be low
and reversed shear and outside the resonant surface in significant positive
shear. The results show that the energetic ions damp and stabilize the mode
when orbiting in significant positive shear, increasing the marginal stability
boundary. However, the inner core region contribution with low and reversed
shear can drive the mode unstable. This effect of shear on the energetic ion
pressure contribution is found to be consistent with the literature. These
results explain the observation that the 2/1 mode was found to be damped and
stabilized by energetic ions in {\delta}f - MHD simulations of tokamak
experiments with positive shear throughout, while the 2/1 mode was found to be
driven unstable in simulations of experiments with weakly reversed shear in the

remained elusive. Bimodal tapping mode keeps the advantages of single-frequency
tapping mode while extending the technique by driving and measuring an
additional resonant mode of the cantilever. The simultaneously measured
observables of this additional resonance provide the additional information
necessary to extract quantitative nanomechanical information about the
tip-sample mechanics. Specifically, driving the higher cantilever resonance in
a frequency modulated (FM) mode allows direct measurement of the tip-sample

which is a broad extension of standard combinatorial optimization, involving
the choice of several feasible solutions at a time. This framework captures
well studied and diverse problems ranging from so-called vulnerability problems
to sharing and partitioning problems. In particular, every standard
combinatorial optimization problem has its shifted counterpart, which is
typically much harder. Already with explicitly given input set the shifted
problem may be NP-hard. In this article we initiate a study of the
parameterized complexity of this framework. First we show that shifting over an
explicitly given set with its cardinality as the parameter may be in XP, FPT or
P, depending on the objective function. Second, we study the shifted problem
over sets definable in MSO logic (which includes, e.g., the well known MSO
partitioning problems). Our main results here are that shifted combinatorial
optimization over MSO definable sets is in XP with respect to the MSO formula
and the treewidth (or more generally clique-width) of the input graph, and is
W[1]-hard even under further severe restrictions.

inequality violation alone, a task known as self-testing of measurements. We
introduce a family of commutation-based measures, which encode all the distinct
arrangements of two projective observables on a qubit. These quantities by
construction take into account the usual limitations of self-testing and since
they are ""weighted"" by the (reduced) state, they automatically deal with
rank-deficient reduced density matrices. We show that these measures can be
estimated from the observed Bell violation in several scenarios and the proofs
rely only on standard linear algebra. The trade-offs turn out to be tight and,
in particular, they give non-trivial statements for arbitrarily small
violations. On the other extreme, observing the maximal violation allows us to
deduce precisely the form of the observables, which immediately leads to a
complete rigidity statement. In particular, we show that for all $n \geq 3$ the
$n$-partite Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko inequality self-tests the
$n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and maximally incompatible qubit
measurements on every party. Our results imply that any pair of projective
observables on a qubit can be certified in a truly robust manner. Finally, we
show that commutation-based measures give a convenient way of expressing
relations among more than two observables.

essence of the method is to convert the underlying evolution equation from its
partial or ordinary differential form (using Duhamel's principle) into an
integral equation. The solution sought is then viewed as a fixed point in both

achieved by introducing a time-dependent renormalization factor which is
numerically computed from the physical properties of the governing evolution

algorithmic solution approaches for this problem are reviewed: (i) the
classical Kalman-Bucy filter which provides an exact solution for the linear
Gaussian problem, (ii) the ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (EnKBF) which is an
approximate filter and represents an extension of the Kalman-Bucy filter to
nonlinear problems, and (iii) the feedback particle filter (FPF) which
represents an extension of the EnKBF and furthermore provides for an consistent
solution in the general nonlinear, non-Gaussian case. The common feature of the
three algorithms is the gain times error formula to implement the update step
(to account for conditioning due to the observations) in the filter. In
contrast to the commonly used sequential Monte Carlo methods, the EnKBF and FPF
avoid the resampling of the particles in the importance sampling update step.
Moreover, the feedback control structure provides for error correction
potentially leading to smaller simulation variance and improved stability
properties. The paper also discusses the issue of non-uniqueness of the filter
update formula and formulates a novel approximation algorithm based on ideas
from optimal transport and coupling of measures. Performance of this and other
algorithms is illustrated for a numerical example.

transit time variation when the average photocurrent varies, and the transit
time variation is due to the change of electron velocity when the average
photocurrent varies. We also show that the AM-to-PM conversion coefficient
depends only on the pulse energy and is independent of the pulse duration when
the duration is less than 500 fs. When the pulse duration is larger than 500
fs, the nulls of the AM-to-PM conversion coefficient shift to larger average
photocurrents. This shift occurs because the increase in that pulse duration
leads to a decrease in the peak photocurrent. The AM-to-PM noise conversion
coefficient changes as the repetition rate varies. However, the repetition rate
does not change the AM-to-PM conversion coefficient as a function of input
optical pulse energy. The repetition rate changes the average photocurrent. We
propose a design that would in theory improve the performance of the device.

inverse-design approach for HEMMs by topology optimization based on the

supporting multipolar resonances, and theoretically demonstrate their
deep-subwavelength imagings for longitudinal waves. Under different prescribed
subwavelength scales, the optimized HEMMs exhibit broadband negative effective

imaging resolution (~{\lambda}/64), representing the record in the field of
elastic metamaterials. The proposed computational approach can be easily
extended to design hyperbolic metamaterials for other wave counterparts. The
present research may provide a novel design methodology for exploring the HEMMs

modules. In this manuscript, we develop an analytical model to investigate the
performance of these generators in the non-linear regime. We identify
dimensionless parameters determining their performance and provide measures to
estimate acceptable range of thermal and electrical resistances of thermionic
generators. We find the relation between the optimum load resistance and the
internal resistance and suggest guide lines for the design of thermionic power
generators. Finally, we show that in the nonlinear regime, thermionic power
generators can have efficiency values higher than the state of the art
thermoelectric modules.

mechanical, and electrical properties. Specially, graphene-based field-effect
transistors (FETs) have evolved rapidly and are now considered as an option for
conventional silicon devices. As a critical step in the design cycle of modern
IC products, compact model refers to the development of models for integrated
semiconductor devices for use in circuit simulations. The purpose of this
review is to provide a theoretical description of current compact model of
graphene field-effect transistors. Special attention is devoted to the charge
sheet model, drift-diffusion model, Boltzmann equation, density of states
(DOS), and surface-potential-based compact model. Finally, an outlook of this
field is briefly discussed.

It is potentially a very important task specially for Bangla speaking
population of Bangladesh and West Bengal. By keeping that in our mind we are
introducing a comprehensive Bangla handwritten character dataset named
BanglaLekha-Isolated. This dataset contains Bangla handwritten numerals, basic
characters and compound characters. This dataset was collected from multiple
geographical location within Bangladesh and includes sample collected from a
variety of aged groups. This dataset can also be used for other classification
problems i.e: gender, age, district. This is the largest dataset on Bangla
handwritten characters yet.
