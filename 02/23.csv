equations representing the Hamiltonian dynamics of field theories. It is a
multi-symplectic integrator that locally conserves the stress-energy tensor
with an excellent precision over very long periods. Its major advantage is that
it is extremely simple (it is basically a centered box scheme) while remaining
locally well defined. We put it to the test in the case of the non-linear wave
equation (with quartic potential) in one spatial dimension, and we explain how
to implement it in higher dimensions. A formal geometric presentation of the
multi-symplectic structure is also given as well as a technical trick allowing
to solve the degeneracy problem that potentially accompanies the
multi-symplectic structure.

$\gamma$-ray emission of 1172 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory. The detection of these neutrinos would constitute evidence for
ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) production in GRBs, as interactions
between accelerated protons and the prompt $\gamma$-ray field would yield
charged pions, which decay to neutrinos. A previously reported search for muon
neutrino tracks from Northern Hemisphere GRBs has been extended to include
three additional years of IceCube data. A search for such tracks from Southern
Hemisphere GRBs in five years of IceCube data has been introduced to enhance
our sensitivity to the highest energy neutrinos. No significant correlation
between neutrino events and observed GRBs is seen in the new data. Combining
this result with previous muon neutrino track searches and a search for cascade
signature events from all neutrino flavors, we obtain new constraints for
single-zone fireball models of GRB neutrino and UHECR production.

more widespread attention in recent years, in part due to efforts to explicitly
represent icebergs in climate models. This calls for increased scrutiny of all
aspects of typical iceberg models. An important component of iceberg models is
the representation of iceberg capsizing, or rolling. Rolling occurs
spontaneously when the ratio of iceberg width to height falls below a critical
threshold. Here we examine previously proposed representations of this
threshold, and we find that there have been crucial errors in the
representation of rolling in many modeling studies to date. We correct these
errors and identify an accurate model representation of iceberg rolling. Next,
we assess how iceberg rolling influences simulation results in a hierarchy of
models. Rolling is found to substantially prolong the lifespan of individual
icebergs and allow them to drift farther offshore, although it is found to have
relatively small impacts on the large-scale freshwater distribution in
comprehensive model simulations. The results suggest that accurate
representations of iceberg rolling may be of particular importance for
operational forecast models of iceberg drift, as well as for regional changes
in high-resolution climate model simulations.

the diagnostic analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of a magnetized plasma in
resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The DMD method is an ideal spatio-temporal
matrix decomposition that correlates spatial features of computational or
experimental data while simultaneously associating the spatial activity with
periodic temporal behavior. DMD can produce low-rank, reduced order surrogate
models that can be used to reconstruct the state of the system and produce
high-fidelity future state predictions. This allows for a reduction in the
computational cost, and, at the same time, accurate approximations of the
problem, even if the data are sparsely sampled. We demonstrate the use of the
method on both numerical and experimental data, showing that it is a successful
mathematical architecture for characterizing the HIT-IS magnetohydrodynamics.
Importantly, the DMD decomposition produces interpretable, dominant mode
structures, including the spheromak mode and a pair of injector-driven modes.
In combination, the 3-mode DMD model produces excellent dynamic reconstructions
that can be used for future state prediction and/or control strategies.

In this work, we investigate the random and deterministic power control

power control is helpful to improve the performance of the transmission for
long distance in the FD networks and reduce the requirement of SI cancellation
capability.

of single-particle electronic states in a wide spectral region up to the

plays a fundamental role in the band structure, leading to splitting of the
valence band edge and to a significant reduction of the effective mass of the

calculate the screened Coulomb interaction and provide numerical values for the
on-site $\bar{V}_{00}$ (Hubbard) and intersite $\bar{V}_{ij}$ interactions. We
find that the screening effects originate predominantly from the 5$p$ states,

leading kinetic and Coulomb energies are shown to be comparable in magnitude,
$|t_{01}|/(\bar{V}_{00}-\bar{V}_{01}) \sim 1.6$, which suggests a strongly

up radio access networks is facing environmental and regulation limitations. In
order to achieve more power efficiency, we design a directional modulation
precoder by considering an $M$-QAM constellation, particularly with
$M=4,8,16,32$. First, extended detection regions are defined for desired
constellations using analytical geometry. Then, constellation points are placed
in the optimal positions of these regions while the minimum Euclidean distance
to adjacent constellation points and detection region boundaries is kept as in
the conventional $M$-QAM modulation. For further power efficiency and symbol
error rate similar to that of fixed design in high SNR, relaxed detection
regions are modeled for inner points of $M=16,32$ constellations. The modeled
extended and relaxed detection regions as well as the modulation
characteristics are utilized to formulate symbol-level precoder design problems
for directional modulation to minimize the transmission power while preserving
the minimum required SNR at the destination. In addition, the extended and
relaxed detection regions are used for precoder design to minimize the output
of each power amplifier. We transform the design problems into convex ones and
devise an interior point path-following iterative algorithm to solve the
mentioned problems and provide details on finding the initial values of the
parameters and the starting point. Results show that compared to the benchmark
schemes, the proposed method performs better in terms of power and peak power
reduction as well as symbol error rate reduction for a wide range of SNRs.

from the perspective of a condensed matter physicist. Reductionism and
emergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet
we rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often
regarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they
compliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by
the Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in
classical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist
view of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on
the understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was
unknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not
understand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an
understanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus
be likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from
current research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show
that the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a
powerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the
cosmos.

intruder detection - to evaluate its ability to identify a non-coherent vector

backward-facing step (height, $H$) is investigated experimentally. Forcing is
applied by a synthetic jet at the edge of the step at Strouhal numbers ranging
from $0.21<St_H<1.98$ ($St_H = f H/U_\infty$) at a Reynolds number of $Re_H =
HU_\infty/\nu = 41000$. In the literature, the effect of Strouhal number on the
reattachment length is often divided into low- and high frequency actuation,
referring to different frequency modes in the unforced flow. In the present
paper, variations with Strouhal number are explained based on entrainment
rather than frequency modes. The reattachment length is shown to decrease
linearly with entrainment. Entrainment is driven by vortices generated by the
forcing and locally entrainment is shown to be qualitatively similar to
circulation for all cases considered. Total circulation (and therewith
entrainment and the effect on the reattachment length) is shown to decrease
with Strouhal number whereas this is not predicted by models based on frequency
modes. An empirical model for the (decay of) circulation is derived by tracking
vortices in phase-locked data. This model is used to decipher relevant scaling
parameters that explain the variations in circulation, entrainment and
reattachment length. A low-Strouhal-number regime is observed for which
vortices are formed at a late stage relative to the recirculation region,
causing a decrease in effectiveness. For high Strouhal numbers vortices are
being re-ingested into the actuator or are packed so close together that they
cancel each other, both decreasing the effectiveness of forcing. In the
intermediate regime a vortex train is formed of which the decay of circulation
increases for increasing Strouhal number. The scaling of this decay fully
explains the observed variation in reattachment length.

recent years, thanks to its ability to address various applications related to

Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale,
complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current
incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations:
they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide
loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of
the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints.
Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving
community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework
to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides
guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the
iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our
experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP
algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.

using statistical physics techniques. They provide a benchmark to study average
case scenarios instead of the worst case one. The interplay between statistical
physics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into
the realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of
clustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the
class of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete
degrees of freedom: standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising
models) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models). In this work
we consider instead problems that involve continuous degrees of freedom. The
simplest prototype of these problems is the perceptron. Here we discuss in
detail the full phase diagram of the model. In the regions of parameter space
where the problem is non-convex, leading to multiple disconnected clusters of
solutions, the solution is critical at the SAT/UNSAT threshold and lies in the
same universality class of the jamming transition of soft spheres. We show how
the critical behavior at the satisfiability threshold emerges, and we compute
the critical exponents associated to the approach to the transition from both
the SAT and UNSAT phase. We conjecture that there is a large universality class
of non-convex continuous CSPs whose SAT-UNSAT threshold is described by the
same scaling solution.

Definition of a suggested finite game includes a family of nested simultaneous
non-cooperative finite games with intra- and inter-coalition externalities. In
this family, games differ by the size of maximum coalition, partitions and by
coalition structure formation rules. A result of every game consists of
partition of players into coalitions and a payoff? profiles for every player.
Every game in the family has an equilibrium in mixed strategies with possibly
more than one coalition. The results of the game differ from those
conventionally discussed in cooperative game theory, e.g. the Shapley value,
strong Nash, coalition-proof equilibrium, core, kernel, nucleolus. We discuss
the following applications of the new game: cooperation as an allocation in one
coalition, Bayesian games, stochastic games and construction of a

questions remain: how do these fossil fields evolve during the post-main
sequence phases, and how do they influence the evolution of hot stars from the
main sequence to their ultimate demise? Filling the void of known magnetic
evolved hot (OBA) stars, studying the evolution of their fossil magnetic fields
along stellar evolution, and understanding the impact of these fields on the
angular momentum, rotation, mass loss, and evolution of the star itself, is
crucial to answering these questions, with far reaching consequences, in

stellar remnants. In the framework of the BRITE spectropolarimetric survey and

transition from a potential $V(\phi)$ with two vacua to the vacuumless case.
The model has kink and antikink solutions that minimize energy. Stability
analysis are described by a Schr\""odinger-like equation with a potential that
transits from a volcano-shape with no vibrational states (in the case of
vacuumless limit) to a smooth valley with one vibrational state. We are
interested on the structure of 2-bounce windows present in kink-antikink
scattering processes. The standard mechanism of Campbell-Schonfeld-Wingate
(CSW) requires the presence of one vibrational state for the occurrence of
2-bounce windows. We report that the effect of increasing the separation of
vacua from the potential $V(\phi)$ has the consequence of trading some of the
first 2-bounce windows predicted by the CSW mechanism by false 2-bounce
windows. Another consequence is the appearance of false 2-bounce windows of
zero-order.

a dense Earth-like atmosphere with a protective ozone layer exists on planets
in the HZ of TRAPPIST-1, UV surface environments would be similar to

UV to reach the surface, making surface environments hostile even to highly

interesting targets for the search for surface life. We anticipate our assay to

particle-based model and set within the SOH (Self-Organized Hydrodynamics)

or data can be incorporated easily into the particle model, whilst the
continuous model allows for easy numerical analysis of the different effects.
However we found that the derived macroscopic model lacks a diffusion term in
the density equations, which is necessary to control the number of waves,
indicating that a higher order approximation during the derivation is crucial.
Upon ad-hoc addition of the diffusion term, we found very good agreement

  turbulence","Minor changes cf. v1",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the accretion phase of a core-collapse supernovae, large amplitude
turbulence is generated by the combination of the standing accretion shock
instability and convection driven by neutrino heating. The turbulence directly
affects the dynamics of the explosion, but there is also the possibility of an
additional, indirect, feedback mechanism due to the effect turbulence can have
upon neutrino flavor evolution and thus the neutrino heating. In this paper we
consider the effect of turbulence during the accretion phase upon neutrino
evolution, both numerically and analytically. Adopting representative supernova
profiles taken from the accretion phase of a supernova simulation, we find the
numerical calculations exhibit no effect from turbulence. We explain this
absence using two analytic descriptions: the Stimulated Transition model and
the Distorted Phase Effect model. In the Stimulated Transition model turbulence
effects depend upon six different lengthscales, and three criteria must be
satisfied between them if one is to observe a change in the flavor evolution
due to Stimulated Transition. We further demonstrate that the Distorted Phase
Effect depends upon the presence of multiple semi-adiabatic MSW resonances or
discontinuities that also can be expressed as a relationship between three of
the same lengthscales. When we examine the supernova profiles used in the
numerical calculations we find the three Stimulated Transition criteria cannot
be satisfied, independent of the form of the turbulence power spectrum, and
that the same supernova profiles lack the multiple semi-adiabatic MSW
resonances or discontinuities necessary to produce a Distorted Phase Effect.
Thus we conclude that even though large amplitude turbulence is present in
supernova during the accretion phase, it has no effect upon neutrino flavor
evolution.

seemed to be significant spectral softening associated with the drop of X-ray

primary sources of gravitational waves targeted by ongoing Pulsar Timing Array
(PTA) experiments and the upcoming space-based LISA interferometer. However,
their formation and merger rates are still highly uncertain. Recent upper
limits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background obtained by PTAs are
starting being in marginal tension with theoretical models for the pairing and
orbital evolution of these systems. This tension can be resolved by assuming
that these binaries are more eccentric or interact more strongly with the
environment (gas and stars) than expected, or by accounting for possible
selection biases in the construction of the theoretical models. However,
another (pessimistic) possibility is that these binaries do not merge at all,
but stall at large ($\sim$ pc) separations. We explore this extreme scenario by
using a galaxy-formation semi-analytic model including massive black holes
(isolated and in binaries), and show that future generations of PTAs will
detect the stochastic gravitational-wave background from the massive black-hole
binary population within $10-15$ years of observations, even in the ""nightmare
scenario"" in which all binaries stall at the hardening radius. Moreover, we
argue that this scenario is too pessimistic, because our model predicts the
existence of a sub-population of binaries with small mass ratios ($q \lesssim
10^{-3}$) that should merge within a Hubble time simply as a result of
gravitational-wave emission. This sub-population will be observable with large
signal-to-noise ratios by future PTAs thanks to next-generation radio
telescopes such as SKA or FAST, and possibly by LISA.

harbouring a $M_\mathrm{BH} = 4\times 10^8 M_\odot $ black hole surrounded by a

of the cosmological value, feedback from the AGN can keep the galaxy quiescent
for about 4.35 Gyr and with properties consistent with black hole mass and
X-ray luminosity scaling relations. However, this can only be achieved if the
AGN feedback model includes both kinetic and radiative feedback modes. The
simulation with only kinetic feedback fails to keep the model galaxy fully
quiescent, while one with only radiative feedback leads to excessive black-hole
growth. For higher baryon fractions (e.g. 50\% of the cosmological value), the
X-ray luminosities exceed observed values by at least one order of magnitude,
and rapid cooling results in a star-forming galaxy. The AGN plays a major role
in keeping the circumgalactic gas at observed metallicities of $Z/Z_\odot
\gtrsim 0.3 $ within the central $\sim 30$ kpc by venting nuclear gas enriched
with metals from residual star formation activity. As indicated by previous
cosmological simulations, our results are consistent with a model for which the

to web-traffic shaping: an online stream of sessions arrive in which, within
each session, we are asked to rank items. The challenge involves optimizing the
ranking in each session so that local vs. global objectives are controlled:
within each session one wishes to maximize a reward (local) while satisfying
certain constraints over the entire set of sessions (global). A typical
application of this setup is that of page optimization in a web portal. We wish
to rank items so that not only is user engagement maximized in each session,
but also other business constraints (such as the number of views/clicks
delivered to various publishing partners) are satisfied.
  We describe an online algorithm for performing this optimization. A novel
element of our approach is the use of linear programming duality and
connections to the celebrated Hungarian algorithm. This framework enables us to
determine a set of \emph{shadow prices} for each traffic-shaping constraint
that can then be used directly in the final ranking function to assign
near-optimal rankings. The (dual) linear program can be solved off-line
periodically to determine the prices. At serving time these prices are used as
weights to compute weighted rank-scores for the items, and the simplicity of
the approach facilitates scalability to web applications. We provide rigorous
theoretical guarantees for the performance of our online algorithm and validate
our approach using numerical experiments on real web-traffic data from a

The objective of this paper is to characterize a sub-class of the problem where

Specifically, it is shown that under some conditions on the $\varphi$-mixing

is that, unlike in the i.i.d. setting, the distributions of the sampled
pay-offs may not have the same characteristics as those of the original bandit
arms. In particular, the $\varphi$-mixing property does not necessarily carry

matrix $A$, given samples of $X=AS$, where $S$ is a random vector with
independent coordinates. Most existing algorithms are provably efficient only
when each $S_i$ has finite and moderately valued fourth moment. However, there
are practical applications where this assumption need not be true, such as
speech and finance. Algorithms have been proposed for heavy-tailed ICA, but
they are not practical, using random walks and the full power of the ellipsoid
algorithm multiple times. The main contributions of this paper are:
  (1) A practical algorithm for heavy-tailed ICA that we call HTICA. We provide
theoretical guarantees and show that it outperforms other algorithms in some
heavy-tailed regimes, both on real and synthetic data. Like the current
state-of-the-art, the new algorithm is based on the centroid body (a first
moment analogue of the covariance matrix). Unlike the state-of-the-art, our
algorithm is practically efficient. To achieve this, we use explicit analytic
representations of the centroid body, which bypasses the use of the ellipsoid
method and random walks.
  (2) We study how heavy tails affect different ICA algorithms, including
HTICA. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that some algorithms that use the
covariance matrix or higher moments can successfully solve a range of ICA
instances with infinite second moment. We study this theoretically and
experimentally, with both synthetic and real-world heavy-tailed data.

irregularly spaced or irregularly documented radiocarbon data becomes evident
from the map generated by Fort (this volume, Chapter 16): while the general
east-west and south-north trends become evident, some areas appear as having
undergone anomalously early transitions to farming. This may be due to faulty
entries into the data base or regional problems with radiocarbon dating, if not
unnoticed or undocumented laboratory mistakes.

an energy boost when crossing the accretion-powered jet. The rate of encounters

on the viscous decretion disk (VDD) theory, in which a disk around a
fast-spinning Be star is formed by material ejected by the central star and
driven to progressively wider orbits by means of viscous torques. For the first
time, we apply the model for both the disk build up and the dissipation phases.
Our simulations offer a good description of the photometric variability in both
phases, which suggests that the VDD model adequately describes the disk
structural evolution. Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to determine the
viscosity parameter (alpha) of the gas, as well as the net mass loss rate. We
find that alpha is variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, and that build up phases
have larger values of alpha than the dissipation phases. Additionally, we find
that, contrary to what is generally assumed, even during quiescence the outward
mass flux is never zero, suggesting that the star alternates between a high
mass-loss phase (outburst) and a low mass-loss phase (quiescence).

thick disk white dwarfs to the Galactic disk luminosity function, which results
in an erronous age measurement. We demonstrate that the ratio of thick/thin
disk white dwarfs is roughly 20\% in the local sample. Simultaneously fitting
for both disk components, we derive ages of 6.8-7.0 Gyr for the thin disk and
8.7 $\pm$ 0.1 Gyr for the thick disk from the local 40 pc sample. Similarly, we
derive ages of 7.4-8.2 Gyr for the thin disk and 9.5-9.9 Gyr for the thick disk

from a constant star formation rate in the past 2.5 Gyr. We constrain the time
difference between the onset of star formation in the thin disk and the thick
disk to be $1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ Gyr. The faint end of the luminosity function
for the halo white dwarfs is less constrained, resulting in an age estimate of

ages for all three major components of the Galaxy are obtained from a sample of
field white dwarfs that is large enough to contain significant numbers of disk

inappropriate for high dimensional applications. When a large number of
parameters are estimated, marginal confidence intervals associated with the
most significant estimates have very low coverage rates: They are too small and
centered at biased estimates. The problem of forming confidence intervals in
high dimensional settings has previously been studied through the lens of
selection adjustment. In this framework, the goal is to control the proportion
of non-covering intervals formed for selected parameters.
  In this paper we approach the problem by considering the relationship between
rank and coverage probability. Marginal confidence intervals have very low
coverage rates for significant parameters and high rates for parameters with
more boring estimates. Many selection adjusted intervals display the same
pattern. This connection motivates us to propose a new coverage criterion for
confidence intervals in multiple testing/covering problems --- the rank
conditional coverage (RCC). This is the expected coverage rate of an interval

interval construction via bootstrapping which produces small intervals and have
a rank conditional coverage close to the nominal level. These methods are

'magic states' to achieve a universal set of operations. Some qubit states are
above a threshold fidelity, allowing them to be converted into magic states via
'magic state distillation', a process based on stabilizer codes from quantum
error correction.
  We define quantum weight enumerators that take into account the sign of the
stabilizer operators. These enumerators completely describe the magic state
distillation behavior when distilling T-type magic states. While it is
straightforward to calculate them directly by counting exponentially many
operator weights, it is also an NP-hard problem to compute them in general.
This suggests that finding a family of distillation schemes with desired
threshold properties is at least as hard as finding the weight distributions of
a family of classical codes.
  Additionally, we develop search algorithms fast enough to analyze all useful
5 qubit codes and some 7 qubit codes, finding no codes that surpass the best

this paper, we demonstrate how an increase in the negative steepness of the
universal mobility relationship improves both the process-related (e.g., oxide
thickness fluctuation, gate work-function fluctuation), as well as
stress-induced or reliability-related (e.g., Bias Temperature Instability or
BTI) parametric variation in CMOS technology. Therefore, we calibrate the
universal mobility parameters to reflect the measured variation of negative
steepness in uniaxially strained CMOS transistor. This allows us to study the
extent of (process-related and stress-induced parametric) variation resilience
in uniaxial strain technology by increasing the negative steepness of the
mobility characteristics. Thus, we show that variability analysis in strained
CMOS technology must consider the presence of self-compensation between
mobility variation and threshold voltage variation, which leads to considerable
amount of variation resilience. Finally, we use detailed circuit simulation to
stress the importance of accurate mobility variation modeling in SPICE analysis

self-defocusing, and do not require a balancing gain. They have been shown to
play a prominent role in ""tubular"" filamentation experiments with powerful,

demonstrates that there exist nonlinear Bessel vortex beams with single or
multiple vorticity that are stable against azimuthal breakup and collapse, and
that the mechanism that renders these vortexes stable is dissipation. The

in systems with multiple scatterers, as well as by experimental investigations
of soliton-impurity interactions, we consider some prototypical case examples
of interactions of dark solitons with a pair of scatterers. In a way
fundamentally opposite to the case of bright solitons (but consonant to their
""anti-particle character""), we find that dark solitons accelerate as they pass
the first barrier and hence cannot be trapped by a second equal-height barrier.
A pair of unequal barriers may lead to reflection from the second one, however
trapping in the inter-barrier region cannot occur. We also give some examples
of dynamical adjusting the barriers to trap the dark soliton in the
inter-barrier region, yet we show that this can only occur over finite time
horizons, with the dark soliton always escaping eventually, contrary again to
what is potentially the case with bright solitons.

  Data - with Applications to Birth Defects",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our work was motivated by a recent study on birth defects of infants born to
pregnant women exposed to a certain medication for treating chronic diseases.
Outcomes such as birth defects are rare events in the general population, which
often translate to very small numbers of events in the unexposed group. As drug
safety studies in pregnancy are typically observational in nature, we control
for confounding in this rare events setting using propensity scores (PS). Using
our empirical data, we noticed that the estimated odds ratio for birth defects
due to exposure varied drastically depending on the specific approach used. The
commonly used approaches with PS are matching, stratification, inverse
probability weighting (IPW) and regression adjustment. The extremely rare
events setting renders the matching or stratification infeasible. In addition,
the PS itself may be formed via different approaches to select confounders from
a relatively long list of potential confounders. We carried out simulation
experiments to compare different combinations of approaches: IPW or regression
adjustment, with 1) including all potential confounders without selection, 2)
selection based on univariate association between the candidate variable and
the outcome, 3) selection based on change in effects (CIE). The simulation
showed that IPW without selection leads to extremely large variances in the
estimated odds ratio, which help to explain the empirical data analysis results
that we had observed. The simulation also showed that IPW with selection based
on univariate association with the outcome is preferred over IPW with CIE.
Regression adjustment has small variances of the estimated odds ratio
regardless of the selection methods used.

  psychology","21 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0177328",,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article is on collective phenomena in pedestrian dynamics during the
assembling and dispersal phases of gatherings. To date pedestrian dynamics have
been primarily studied in the natural and engineering sciences. Pedestrians are
analyzed and modeled as driven particles revealing self-organizing phenomena
and complex transport characteristics. However, pedestrians in crowds also
behave as living beings according to stimulus-response mechanisms or act as
human subjects on the basis of social norms, social identities or strategies.
To show where pedestrian dynamics need social psychology in addition to the
natural sciences we propose the application of three categories: phenomena,
behavior and action. They permit a clear discrimination between situations in
which minimal models from the natural sciences are appropriate and those in
which sociological and psychological concepts are needed.
  To demonstrate the necessity of this framework, an experiment in which a
large group of people (n=270) enters a concert hall through two different
spatial barrier structures is analyzed. These two structures correspond to
everyday situations such as boarding trains and access to immigration desks.
Methods from the natural and social sciences are applied. Firstly, physical
measurements show the influence of the spatial structure on the dynamics of the
entrance procedure. Density, waiting time and speed of progress show large
variations. Secondly, a questionnaire study (n=60) reveals how people perceive
and evaluate these entrance situations. Markedly different expectations, social
norms and strategies are associated with the two spatial structures. The
results from the questionnaire study do not always conform to objective
physical measures, indicating the limitations of models which are based on
objective physical measures alone and which neglect subjective perspectives.

associated radiation dose. Reduction of radiation dose associated with CT can
increase noise and artifacts, which can adversely affect diagnostic confidence.
Denoising of low-dose CT images on the other hand can help improve diagnostic
confidence, which however is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature,
since one noisy image patch may correspond to many different output patches. In
the past decade, machine learning based approaches have made quite impressive
progress in this direction. However, most of those methods, including the
recently popularized deep learning techniques, aim for minimizing
mean-squared-error (MSE) between a denoised CT image and the ground truth,
which results in losing important structural details due to over-smoothing,
although the PSNR based performance measure looks great. In this work, we
introduce a new perceptual similarity measure as the objective function for a
deep convolutional neural network to facilitate CT image denoising. Instead of
directly computing MSE for pixel-to-pixel intensity loss, we compare the
perceptual features of a denoised output against those of the ground truth in a
feature space. Therefore, our proposed method is capable of not only reducing
the image noise levels, but also keeping the critical structural information at
the same time. Promising results have been obtained in our experiments with a
large number of CT images.

A
related ongoing revolution -- also theoretically not understood -- concerns
their ability to serve as generative models for complicated types of data such
as images and texts. These models are trained using ideas like variational
autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.
  We take a first cut at explaining the expressivity of multilayer nets by
giving a sufficient criterion for a function to be approximable by a neural
network with $n$ hidden layers. A key ingredient is Barron's Theorem
\cite{Barron1993}, which gives a Fourier criterion for approximability of a
function by a neural network with 1 hidden layer. We show that a composition of
$n$ functions which satisfy certain Fourier conditions (""Barron functions"") can
be approximated by a $n+1$-layer neural network.
  For probability distributions, this translates into a criterion for a
probability distribution to be approximable in Wasserstein distance -- a
natural metric on probability distributions -- by a neural network applied to a
fixed base distribution (e.g., multivariate gaussian).
  Building up recent lower bound work, we also give an example function that
shows that composition of Barron functions is more expressive than Barron
functions alone.

subject to extensive studies. One of the challenges facing Distribution Market
Operators (DMOs) is to implement a fair and economically efficient pricing
mechanism that can incentivize consumers to positively contribute to grid
operations and to improve economic performance of the distribution system. This
paper studies a penalty-based pricing mechanism in distribution markets and
further investigates the interrelationship between the locational marginal
prices (LMPs) at transmission and distribution levels. As a result, a
closed-form relationship between these LMPs is derived. The possibility of
zeroing out the settlement profit is further investigated under the proposed

  Learning Perspective","This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE Transaction on
  Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT cs.AI cs.GT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  LTE in unlicensed spectrum using licensed assisted access LTE (LTE-LAA) is a
promising approach to overcome the wireless spectrum scarcity. However, to reap
the benefits of LTE-LAA, a fair coexistence mechanism with other incumbent WiFi
deployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach is
proposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-LAA small base
stations (SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively
perform dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum
access while guaranteeing fairness with existing WiFi networks and other
LTE-LAA operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables future
delay-tolerant LTE-LAA data demands to be served within a given prediction
window ahead of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of
the unlicensed spectrum during off-peak hours while maximizing the total served
LTE-LAA traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative game model is formulated in
which SBSs are modeled as Homo Egualis agents that aim at predicting a sequence
of future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with
WLAN and other LTE-LAA operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep
learning algorithm is then shown to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium
(NE), when it converges. Simulation results using real data traces show that
the proposed scheme can yield up to 28% and 11% gains over a conventional
reactive approach and a proportional fair coexistence mechanism, respectively.
The results also show that the proposed framework prevents WiFi performance
degradation for a densely deployed LTE-LAA network.

single additive buyer is #P-hard, even when the distributions have support size
2 for each item and, more importantly, even when the optimal solution is
guaranteed to be of a very simple kind: the seller picks a price for each
individual item and a price for the grand bundle of all the items; the buyer
can purchase either the grand bundle at its given price or any subset of items
at their total individual prices. The following problems are also #P-hard, as
immediate corollaries of the proof:
  1. determining if individual item pricing is optimal for a given instance,
  2. determining if grand bundle pricing is optimal, and
  3. computing the optimal (deterministic) revenue.
  On the positive side, we show that when the distributions are i.i.d. with
support size 2, the optimal revenue obtainable by any mechanism, even a
randomized one, can be achieved by a simple solution of the above kind
(individual item pricing with a discounted price for the grand bundle) and
furthermore, it can be computed in polynomial time. The problem can be solved
in polynomial time too when the number of items is constant.

the Journal of Neuroscience, The Quest for the FFA and Where It Led (Kanwisher,
2017). I reflect on the extensive research program dedicated to the study of
how and why perceptual expertise explains the many ways that faces are special,
a research program which both predates and follows the Kanwisher (1997)
landmark article where the fusiform face area (FFA) is named. The expertise
accounts suggests that the FFA is an area recruited by expertise individuating
objects that are perceptually similar because they share a configuration of
parts. While Kanwisher (2017) discussed the expertise account only very briefly
and only to dismiss it, there is strong and replicable evidence that responses
in the FFA are highly sensitive to experience with non-face objects. I point
out that Kanwisher was well positioned to present these findings in their
historical context as she participated in the design of the first fMRI study on
car and bird expertise, as well as the first replication of this finding.
Perhaps most relevant to readers interested in the neural bases of face
processing, it is important to distinguish studies that describe the phenomenon
of face-selectivity from those that test an explanation for this phenomenon. In
the Progressions article, arguments for a face-dedicated processing module that
is not the result of our experience with faces are provided without attention
to a great deal of expertise research which is directly inconsistent with that
claim. The claim also lacks more direct support, as face-selective responses in
the visual system are not found in infants and children and face-selective
activity in FFA does not appear to be heritable.

methodological issues of this debate relate to the proper treatment of

may be difficult to separate from time-evolving fluctuations. Some argue that
temperature variability is indeed increasing globally, whereas others conclude
it is decreasing or remains practically unchanged. Meanwhile, a consensus
appears to emerge that local variability in certain regions (e.g. Western
Europe and North America) has indeed been increasing in the past 40 years. Here
we investigate the nature of connections between external forcing and climate
variability conceptually by using a laboratory-scale minimal model of
mid-latitude atmospheric thermal convection subject to continuously decreasing
`equator-to-pole' temperature contrast, mimicking climate change. The analysis
of temperature records from an ensemble of experimental runs (`realisations')

nodes of the future. Yet, such modeling of defect scattering remains unsolved
since existing modeling techniques fail to account for complex defect and wafer
geometries. Here, we present results of laser beam scattering from spherical
and ellipsoidal particles located on the surface of a silicon wafer. A
commercially available electromagnetic field solver (HFSS) was deployed on a
multiprocessor cluster to obtain results with previously unknown accuracy down
to light scattering intensity of -170 dB. We compute three dimensional
scattering patterns of silicon nanospheres located on a semiconductor wafer for
both perpendicular and parallel polarization and show the effect of sphere size
on scattering. We further computer scattering patterns of nanometer scale
ellipsoidal particles having different orientation angles and unveil the
effects of ellipsoidal orientation on scattering.

Feature chaining is further proposed so that the feature learning for the
current cascade stage uses the features in previous stages as the prior
information. The chained ConvNet features and classifiers of multiple stages
are jointly learned in an end-to-end network. In this way, features and
classifiers at latter stages handle more difficult samples with the help of

iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ exhibit a low-energy electronic structure remarkably
similar to the cuprates. Whether a superconducting state exists as in the
cuprates requires understanding the correlated spin-orbit entangled electronic
states. Recent experiments discovered hidden order in the parent and electron
doped iridates, some with striking analogies to the cuprates, including Fermi
surface pockets, Fermi arcs, and pseudogap. Here, we study the correlation and
disorder effects in a five-orbital model derived from the band theory. We find

plaquette spin flux due to spin procession as electrons hop between Ir atoms,
akin to the intersite SOC in quantum spin Hall insulators. The associated
staggered circulating $J_\text{eff}=1/2$ spin current can be probed by advanced
techniques of spin-current detection in spintronics. This electronic order can
emerge spontaneously from the intersite Coulomb interactions between the

to the social aspects of consumers' choices. The main goal of this line of
research is to help two sided platform firms to target their marketing policies
given the great heterogeneity among their customers. In three essays, I
combined structural modeling and machine learning approaches to first
understand customers' responses to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, using
unique data sets I scraped from the web, and then explore methods to optimize
two sided platforms' firms' reactions accordingly. The first essay examines
""social learning"" in the mobile app store context, controlling for intrinsic
value of hedonic and utilitarian mobile apps, price, advertising, and number of
options available. The second essay investigates bidders' anticipated winner
and loser regret in the context of the eBay online auction platform. Using a
large data set from eBay and empirical Bayesian estimation method, I quantify
the bidders' anticipation of regret in various product categories, and
investigate the role of experience in explaining the bidders' regret and
learning behaviors. The third essay investigates the effects of Gamification
incentive mechanisms in an online platform for user generated content. I use an
ensemble method over LDA, mixed normal and k-mean clustering methods to segment
users into competitors, collaborators, achievers, explorers and uninterested
users. These findings help the Gamification platform to target its users. The
simulation counterfactual analysis suggests that a two sided platform can
increase the number of user contributions, by making earning badges more
difficult.

difficult to measure from Earth. Radio occultations are a common method for
measuring these properties, but they traditionally rely on radio transmissions
from a spacecraft near the planet. Here we explore whether occultations of
radio emissions from a distant astrophysical radio source can be used to
measure magnetic field strength, plasma density, and neutral density around
planets. In a theoretical case study of Jupiter, we find that significant
changes in polarization angle due to Faraday rotation occur for radio signals
that pass within 10 Jupiter radii of the planet and that significant changes in
frequency and power occur from radio signals that pass through the neutral
atmosphere. There are sufficient candidate radio sources, such as pulsars,
active galactic nuclei, and masers, that occultations are likely to occur at
least once per year. For pulsars, time delays in the arrival of their emitted
pulses can be used to measure plasma density. Exoplanets, whose physical
properties are very challenging to observe, may also occult distant
astrophysical radio sources, such as their parent stars.

opportunities of exploring new insights through data analytics. However, big
data is mostly structured but can be semi-structured or unstructured. It is
normally so large that it is not only difficult but also slow to process using
traditional computing systems. One of the solutions is to format the data as
graph data structures and process them on shared memory architecture to use
fast and novel policies such as transactional memory. In most graph
applications in big data type problems such as bioinformatics, social networks,
and cyber security, graphs are sparse in nature. Due to this sparsity, we have
the opportunity to use Transactional Memory (TM) as the synchronization policy
for critical sections to speedup applications. At low conflict probability TM
performs better than most synchronization policies due to its inherent
non-blocking characteristics. TM can be implemented in Software, Hardware or a
combination of both. However, hardware TM implementations are fast but limited
by scarce hardware resources while software implementations have high overheads
which can degrade performance. In this paper, we develop a low overhead, yet

some grouping-test methods such as Higher Criticism test (HC), Berk-Jones test

frequently small and moderately large at most. In order to properly apply these
optimal tests and wisely choose them for practical studies, it is important to
know how to get the p-values and statistical power of them. To address this
problem in an even broader context, this paper provides analytical solutions
for a general family of goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests, which covers these optimal
tests. For any given i.i.d. and continuous distributions of the input test
statistics of the $n$ features, both p-value and statistical power of such a
GOF test can be calculated. By calculation we compared the finite-sample
performances of asymptotically optimal tests under the normal mixture
alternative. Results show that HC is the best choice when signals are rare,
while B-J is more robust over various signal patterns. In the application to a
real genome-wide association study, results illustrate that the p-value
calculation works well, and the optimal tests have potentials for detecting
novel disease genes with weak genetic effects. The calculations have been
implemented in an R package SetTest and published on the CRAN.

because the existing collapsed Gibbs sampling and instantiated weight

quality with mean-field assumptions. Moreover, an efficient distributed

  In this paper, we propose a novel partially collapsed Gibbs sampling (PCGS)

initialization strategy is presented to further improve the model quality.
Finally, we propose an efficient distributed implementation of PCGS through

macroeconomics, finance, and internet traffic. Our package extends solution
algorithms from the machine learning and signal processing literatures to a
time dependent setting: selecting the regularization parameter by sequential
cross validation and provides substantial improvements in forecasting
performance over conventional methods. We offer a user-friendly interface that
utilizes R's s4 object class structure which makes our methodology easily

  In this paper, we present an overview of our notation, the models that

simulation study comparing the performance of several procedures that refit the
support selected by a BigVAR procedure according to several variants of least
squares and conclude that refitting generally degrades forecast performance.

reduction. Well-known approaches include multi-continuum techniques, which have
been commonly used in approximating subgrid effects for flow and transport in
fractured media. Our goal in this paper is to (1) show a relation between
multi-continuum approaches and Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method
(GMsFEM) and (2) to discuss coupling these approaches for solving problems in
complex multiscale fractured media. The GMsFEM, a systematic approach,
constructs multiscale basis functions via local spectral decomposition in
pre-computed snapshot spaces. We show that GMsFEM can automatically identify
separate fracture networks via local spectral problems. We discuss the relation
between these basis functions and continuums in multi-continuum methods. The
GMsFEM can automatically detect each continuum and represent the interaction
between the continuum and its surrounding (matrix). For problems with
simplified fracture networks, we propose a simplified basis construction with
the GMsFEM. This simplified approach is effective when the fracture networks
are known and have simplified geometries. We show that this approach can
achieve a similar result compared to the results using the GMsFEM with spectral
basis functions. Further, we discuss the coupling between the GMsFEM and
multi-continuum approaches. In this case, many fractures are resolved while for
unresolved fractures, we use a multi-continuum approach with local
Representative Volume Element (RVE) information. As a result, the method deals
with a system of equations on a coarse grid, where each equation represents one
of the continua on the fine grid. We present various basis construction
mechanisms and numerical results.

(100 {\mu}W) is scanned across a silicon nitride cantilever while its effect on
the first three resonance modes is detected via a low-power readout laser (1

back-action is not only dependent on position but also the shape of the
resonance mode. Relevant silicon nitride material parameters are extracted by
fitting the temperature-dependent frequency response of the first three modes
to finite element (FE) simulations. In a second round of simulations, using the

feedback to maximize the desired signal power of each user. The digital
precoder is designed based on quantization and feedback of effective channel to
mitigate multiuser interference. Alternatively, we propose a one-stage feedback
scheme which effectively reduces the complexity of the signalling and feedback
procedure. Specifically, the second-order channel statistics are leveraged to
design digital precoder for interference mitigation while all feedback overhead
is reserved for precise analog beamforming. Under a fixed total feedback
constraint, we investigate the conditions under which the one-stage feedback
scheme outperforms the conventional two-stage counterpart. Moreover, a rate
splitting (RS) transmission strategy is introduced to further tackle the
multiuser interference and enhance the rate performance. Consider (1) RS
precoded by the one-stage feedback scheme and (2) conventional transmission
strategy precoded by the two-stage scheme with the same first-stage feedback as
(1) and also certain amount of extra second-stage feedback. We show that (1)
can achieve a sum rate comparable to that of (2). Hence, RS enables remarkable
saving in the second-stage training and feedback overhead.

improve the sensitivity to large angular scales in cosmic microwave background
(CMB) polarization measurements. With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure
three of the Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$ and $U$, thereby avoiding the set of
systematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of
orthogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large
aperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum
half-wave plate diameter of $\sim$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between
the primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address
the intensity to polarization ($I{\rightarrow}P$) leakage of the optics, which
becomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics
that arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the
performance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a
Gregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is
placed near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors. We find
that the $I{\rightarrow}P$ leakage is larger than the expectation from the
physical properties of our primary mirror, resulting in a 1/f knee of 100 mHz.
The excess leakage could be due to imperfections in the detector system, i.e.
detector non-linearity in the responsivity and time-constant. We demonstrate,
however, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal,
the 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz ($\ell \sim$39 for our scan
strategy), which is very promising to probe the primordial B-mode signal. We
also discuss methods for further noise subtraction in future projects where the
precise temperature control of instrumental components and the leakage
reduction will play a key role.

violate the Lieb-Robinson bound in non-relativistic quantum mechanics so that
an action in one place will immediately cause a change in the distance. We show

  for PFG anomalous diffusion and their general solutions","Submitted to Physical Review E",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The studying of anomalous diffusion by pulsed field gradient (PFG) diffusion
technique still faces challenges. Two different research groups have proposed
modified Bloch equation for anomalous diffusion. However, these equations have
different forms and, therefore, yield inconsistent results. The discrepancy in
these reported modified Bloch equations may arise from different ways of
combining the fractional diffusion equation with the precession equation where
the time derivatives have different derivative orders and forms. Moreover, to
the best of my knowledge, the general PFG signal attenuation expression
including finite gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect for time-space fractional
diffusion based on the fractional derivative has yet to be reported by other
methods. Here, based on different combination strategy, two new modified Bloch
equations are proposed, which belong to two significantly different types: a
differential type based on the fractal derivative and an integral type based on
the fractional derivative. The merit of the integral type modified Bloch
equation is that the original properties of the contributions from linear or
nonlinear processes remain unchanged at the instant of the combination. The
general solutions including the FGPW effect were derived from these two
equations as well as from two other methods: a method observing the signal
intensity at the origin and the recently reported effective phase shift
diffusion equation method. The relaxation effect was also considered. It is
found that the relaxation behavior influenced by fractional diffusion based on
the fractional derivative deviates from that of normal diffusion. The general
solution agrees perfectly with continuous-time random walk (CTRW) simulations
as well as reported literature results. The new modified Bloch equations is a
valuable tool to describe PFG anomalous diffusion in NMR and MRI.

fast-charging stations; 2) highway transportation networks under PEV driving
range constraints; 3) PV power plants with reactive power control. Then, we
formulate a two-stage stochastic mixed integer second order cone program

PV power plants. To address the uncertainty of future scenarios, a significant
number of future typical load, traffic flow and PV generation curves are
adopted. This makes the problem large scale. We design a Generalized Benders

this work is the first that jointly plans both PEV fast-charging stations and

Characterization of flows of particulate media is of great practical and

of a critical rigidity transition in the dense regime dominated by highly
intermittent fluctuations that severely affects the flow properties. Here, we
unveil the underlying mechanisms of rare fluctuations in soft particulate

the critical jamming density and become suppressed near the jamming transition.

starspots in the longer-period regime suggests that some of the stars with
large starspots show a much lower flare activity than the superflare stars with
the same spot area. Assuming simple relations between spot area and lifetime
and between spot temperature and photospheric temperature, we compared the size
distribution of large starspot groups on slowly-rotating solar-type stars with
that of sunspot groups. The size distribution of starspots shows the power-law

located flexibly in the network. However, network load balancing can be
critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service Function Chains

these chained functions increases the ping-pong traffic between VNFs, directly
affecting to the efficiency of bandwidth utilization. The optimization of the
placement of these VNFs is a challenge as also other factors need to be
considered, such as the resource utilization. To address this issue, we study
the problem of VNF placement with replications, and especially the potential of

general if they would be true for cubic graphs. Since most of them are
trivially true for 3-edge-colorable cubic graphs, cubic graphs which are not
3-edge-colorable, often called {\em snarks}, play a key role in this context.
Here, we survey parameters measuring how far apart a non 3-edge-colorable graph
is from being 3-edge-colorable. We study their interrelation and prove some new
results. Besides getting new insight into the structure of snarks, we show that
such measures give partial results with respect to these important conjectures.

functions which is, among other good properties, closed under composition.
However, the best known algorithms for composing two-way transducers cause a
double exponential blow-up in the size of the inputs. In this paper, we
introduce a class of transducers for which the composition has polynomial
complexity. It is the class of reversible transducers, for which the
computation steps can be reversed deterministically. While in the one-way
setting this class is not very expressive, we prove that any two-way transducer
can be made reversible through a single exponential blow-up. As a consequence,
we prove that the composition of two-way transducers can be done with a single
exponential blow-up in the number of states. A uniformization of a relation is
a function with the same domain and which is included in the original relation.
Our main result actually states that we can uniformize any non-deterministic
two-way transducer by a reversible transducer with a single exponential
blow-up, improving the known result by de Souza which has a quadruple
exponential complexity. As a side result, our construction also gives a
quadratic transformation from copyless streaming string transducers to two-way
transducers, improving the exponential previous bound.

co-occurrency, sequentuality, periodicity and recurrency of the purchased
items. To this aim, we define a pattern Temporal Annotated Recurring Sequence

define the method to extract TARS and develop a predictor for next basket named
TBP (TARS Based Predictor) that, on top of TARS, is able to to understand the
level of the customer's stocks and recommend the set of most necessary items.
By adopting the TBP the supermarket chains could crop tailored suggestions for

the customer purchase behavior, and that TBP outperforms the state-of-the-art

Filter-based observations, such as the IRIS SJI 2832 filter, show WL-like

real continuum emission or enhanced spectral lines, possibly turning into
emission. The difficulty in filter-based observations, contrary to spectral
observations, is to determine which processes contribute to the observed
brightening during flares. Here we determine the contribution of the Balmer
continuum and the spectral line emission to IRIS' SJI 2832 emission by
analyzing the appropriate passband in simultaneous IRIS NUV spectra. We find
that spectral line emission can contribute up to 100% to the observed SJI
emission, that the relative contributions usually temporally vary, and that the
highest SJI enhancements that are observed are most likely because of the
Balmer continuum. We conclude that care should be taken when calling SJI 2832 a
continuum filter during flares, because the influence of the lines on the
emission can be significant.

to study more complicated partition identities, and apply it to prove
refinements and generalisations of three partition identities. The first one,
Siladi\'c's theorem (2002), comes from vertex operator algebras. The second
one, a conjectural identity of Primc (1999), comes from crystal base theory.
The last one is a very general identity about coloured overpartitions which
generalises and unifies several generalisations of Schur's theorem due to

then we can derandomize blackbox PIT for general circuits in quasipolynomial

Another tiny family of interest is when we restrict the arity $n=\omega(1)$ to

find a blackbox PIT with time-complexity $sd2^{O(n)}$. We give several examples

devising poly-time hitting-sets, but the same question for their $s$-variate

structure of a large corpus of documents. A range of methods have been proposed
in the literature, including probabilistic topic models and techniques based on
matrix factorization. However, in both cases, standard implementations rely on
stochastic elements in their initialization phase, which can potentially lead
to different results being generated on the same corpus when using the same
parameter values. This corresponds to the concept of ""instability"" which has
previously been studied in the context of $k$-means clustering. In many
applications of topic modeling, this problem of instability is not considered
and topic models are treated as being definitive, even though the results may
change considerably if the initialization process is altered. In this paper we
demonstrate the inherent instability of popular topic modeling approaches,
using a number of new measures to assess stability. To address this issue in
the context of matrix factorization for topic modeling, we propose the use of
ensemble learning strategies. Based on experiments performed on annotated text

stationary patterns of localized activity. The results are interpreted with a
theoretical analysis of a simplified bistable reaction-diffusion model. Weak
coupling results in trivial pinned states where the activation cannot
propagate. At strong coupling, uniform state is expected with active or
inactive elements at small or large degree networks respectively. Nontrivial
stationary spatial pattern, corresponding to an activation pinning, is
predicted to occur at intermediate number of peripheral elements and at
intermediate coupling strengths, where the central activation of the network is
pinned, but the peripheral activation propagates toward the center. The results
are confirmed in experiments with star networks of bistable electrochemical
reactions. The experiments confirm the existence of the stationary spatial
patterns and the dependence of coupling strength on the number of peripheral
elements for transitions between pinned and retreating or spreading fronts in
forced network configurations (where the central or periphery elements are

the second administers the Jacobian of the constraints and possible low-rank
corrections to the Hessian. The proposed updating strategies take advantage of
ALM convergence results and avoid frequent refreshing. Constraint
administration takes into account complementarity over the Lagrange multipliers
and admits relaxation. The preconditioner is designed for problems where
constraint quantity is small compared to the search space. A virtue of the
scheme is that it is agnostic to the preconditioning technique used for the
Hessian of the Lagrangian function. The strategy described can be used for

gap, which provides unreal drastic red shift of absorption spectra of
open-shell molecules into IR region. The conclusion is justified by a
comparative analysis of calculated and experimental data on absorption and

walker whose transitions in a given direction depend on a weighted linear
combination of the number of both right and left previous transitions. The
diffusion process is nonstationary and its probability develops the phenomenon
of aging. Depending on the characteristic memory parameters, the ensemble
behavior may be normal, superdiffusive, or ballistic. In contrast, the
time-averaged mean squared displacement is equal to that of a normal undriven
random walk, which renders the process non-ergodic. In addition, and similarly
to Levy walks [Godec and Metzler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 020603 (2013)], for
trajectories of finite duration the time-averaged displacement apparently
become random with properties that depend on the measurement time and also on
the memory properties. These features are related to the non-stationary
power-law decay of the transition probabilities to their stationary values.
Time-averaged response to a bias is also calculated. In contrast with Levy

well-known that, in the limit of very large number of BS antennas, the system
performance is limited by pilot contamination, due to the fact that the same
set of orthogonal pilots is reused in multiple cells. In this paper, we propose
a low-complexity algorithm that uses the received UL wideband pilot snapshots
in an observation window comprising several coherence blocks (CBs) to obtain an
estimate of the angle-delay Power Spread Function (PSF) of the received signal.
This is generally given by the sum of the angle-delay PSF of the desired user
and the angle-delay PSFs of the copilot users (CPUs), i.e., the users re-using
the same pilot dimensions in other cells/sectors. We propose supervised and
unsupervised clustering algorithms to decompose the estimated PSF and isolate
the part corresponding to the desired user only. We use this decomposition to
obtain an estimate of the covariance matrix of the user wideband channel
vector, which we exploit to decontaminate the desired user channel estimate by
applying Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) smoothing filter, i.e., the optimal
channel interpolator in the MMSE sense. We also propose an effective
low-complexity approximation/implementation of this smoothing filter. We use
numerical simulations to assess the performance of our proposed method, and
compare it with other recently proposed schemes that use the same idea of
separability of users in the angle-delay domain.

$\mathsf{LF}$ with monadic, dependent type constructors indexed with predicates
over judgements, called Locks. These monads capture various possible proof
attitudes in establishing the judgment of the object logic encoded by an
$\mathsf{LF}$ type. Standard examples are factoring-out the verification of a
constraint or delegating it to an external oracle, or supplying some
non-apodictic epistemic evidence, or simply discarding the proof witness of a
precondition deeming it irrelevant. This new framework, called Lax Logical
Framework, $\mathsf{LLF}_{\cal P}$, is a conservative extension of
$\mathsf{LF}$, and hence it is the appropriate metalanguage for dealing
formally with side-conditions in rules or external evidence in logical systems.
$\mathsf{LLF}_{\cal P}$ arises once the monadic nature of the lock
type-constructor, ${\cal L}^{\cal P}_{M,\sigma}[\cdot]$, introduced by the
authors in a series of papers, together with Marina Lenisa, is fully exploited.
The nature of the lock monads permits to utilize the very Lock destructor,
${\cal U}^{\cal P}_{M,\sigma}[\cdot]$, in place of Moggi's monadic $let_T$,
thus simplifying the equational theory. The rules for ${\cal U}^{\cal
P}_{M,\sigma}[\cdot]$ permit also the removal of the monad once the constraint
is satisfied. We derive the meta-theory of $\mathsf{LLF}_{\cal P}$ by a novel
indirect method based on the encoding of $\mathsf{LLF}_{\cal P}$ in
$\mathsf{LF}$. We discuss encodings in $\mathsf{LLF}_{\cal P}$ of call-by-value
$\lambda$-calculi, Hoare's Logic, and Fitch-Prawitz Naive Set Theory.

like Type III seesaw model are probed through their direct production and
subsequent decay at high energy electron-positron collider. Unlike the case of
LHC, the production process has strong dependence on the mixing parameter
($V_{e,\mu}$), making the leptonic collider unique to probe such mixing. We
have established that with suitably chosen kinematic cuts, a 1 TeV $e^+e^-$
collider could probe the presence of $\Sigma$ of mass in the range of 500 GeV
having $V_e=0.05$ with a few inverse femto barn luminosity through single
production. The cross section is found to be not sufficient to probe the case
of triplet-muon mixing through single triplet production. On the other hand,
the pair production considered at 2 TeV centre of mass energy is capable of
probing both the mixing scenarios efficiently. Studying the mass reach,
presence of charged fermionic triplets upto a mass of about 980 GeV could be
established at $3\sigma$ level through single production at a 1 TeV $e^+e^-$
collider with moderate luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$, assuming $V_e = 0.05$ . The
pair production case requires larger luminosity, as the cross section is
smaller in this case. With an integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, the mass

using multipath routing in NFV to optimize network performance in response to
the dynamic changes of user demands. In particular, we first formulate the
optimization problem of load balancing as a mixed integer linear program for
achieving the optimal solution. We then develop the ORBIT algorithm that solves
the online load balancing problem. The performance guarantee of ORBIT is
analytically proved in comparison with the optimal offline solution. The

show that it has to be incorporated into the coupled channel formalism due to
an enhancement produced by a singularity in the triangular loop with $\rho$,
nucleon and $\pi$ as internal loop lines and $\pi$ and $\Delta$ as external

dynamical generation of the $N(1700)$ resonance due to the non-linear dynamics

the dark matter candidate evade the strong constraints from the dark matter

been shown that they possess a lot of nice properties. In 2005, a new property
of independent GUE random matrices is discovered by Haagerup and
Thorbj{\o}rnsen in their paper [18], it is called strong convergence property
and then more random matrices with this property are followed (see [27], [5],
[1], [24], [10] and [3]). In general, the definition can be stated for a
sequence of tuples over some \text{C}^{\ast}-algebras. And in this general
setting, some stability property under reduced free product can be achieved
(see Skoufranis [30] and Pisier [26]), as an analogy of the result by Camille
Male [24] for random matrices.
  In this paper, we want to show that, for a sequence of strongly convergent

non-commutative rational functions under certain assumptions. Roughly speaking,
the strong convergence property is stable under taking the inverse. As a direct

Leibniz's original intuition, but with an important difference: their product
is null, as the Dutch theologian Bernard Nieuwentijt sustained, against
Leibniz's opinion. The starting-point is the concept of shadow, and from it we
define indiscernibility (the central concept) and monad. Monads of points have
a global-local nature, because in spite of being infinite-dimensional real
affine spaces with the same cardinal as the whole generalized continuum, they
are closed intervals with length 0. Monads and shadows (initially defined for
points) are then extended to any subset of the new continuum, and their study
reveals interesting results of preservation in the areas of set theory and
topology. All these concepts do not depend on a definition of limit in the new
continuum; yet using them we obtain the basic results of the differential
calculus. Finally, we give two examples illustrating how the global-local
nature of the monad of a real number can be applied to the differential

manifolds in such nonlinear systems with (quasi)-periodic attractors in terms

isostables for a general class of nonlinear systems. We provide a simple
example of a measure-preserving system that is not chaotic but has continuous
spectrum, and discuss experimental observations of spectrum on such systems. We
define the coherent principal dimension for a class of datasets based on the

when the government implements the reward-penalty mechanism for carbon emission
and recycling simultaneously, the recycling rate as well as the buy-back price
offered by the manufacturer are higher than those when the government conducts
reward-penalty mechanism exclusively for carbon emission; 2) when the
government implements carbon emission constraint, both retailers' selling

introduced with a combination of data-driven methods for automation of model

methods for combination of different techniques. The implementation of the
proposed approach for simulation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was developed
and used within an experimental study. Methods: Combination of data, text, and
process mining techniques and machine learning approaches for analysis of
electronic health records (EHRs) with discrete-event simulation (DES) and
queueing theory for simulation of patient flow was proposed. The performed
analysis of EHRs for ACS patients enable identification of several classes of
clinical pathways (CPs) which were used to implement a more realistic
simulation of the patient flow. The developed solution was implemented using
Python libraries (SimPy, SciPy, and others). Results: The proposed approach
enables more realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow within a
group of related departments. Experimental study shows that the improved
simulation of patient length of stay for ACS patient flow obtained from EHRs in

alternatives and to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, is
too vast a horizon to be summed up in such a simple sentence. The extreme
abstractness of creativity makes it harder to quantify in its entirety. Yet, a
lot of efforts have been made both by psychologists and neurobiologists to
identify its signature. A general conformity is expressed in the Free
association theory, i.e. the more freely a persons conceptual nodes are
connected, the more divergent thinker (also, creative) he or she is. Also,
tolerance of ambiguity is found to be related to divergent thinking. In this
study, we approach the problem of creativity from a theoretical physics
standpoint. Theoretically, for the initial conceptual state, the next jump to
any other node is equally probable and non-deterministic. Repeated intervention
of external stimulus (analogous to a measurement) is responsible for such
jumps. And to study such a non-deterministic system with continuous
measurements, Quantum theory has been proven the most successful, time and
again. We suggest that this collection of nodes form a system which is likely
to be governed by quantum physics and specify the transformations which could
help explain the conceptual jump between states. Our argument, from the point
of view of physics is that the initial evolution of the creative process is
identical, person or field independent. To answer the next obvious question
about individual creativity, we hypothesize that the quantum system, under
continuous measurements (in the form of external stimuli) evolves with chaotic
dynamics, hence separating a painter from a musician. Possible experimental
methodology of these effects has also been suggested using ambiguous figures.

variety of application domains. Numerical models are powerful and necessary
tools to optimize their design and predict their performance. The
electromagnetic modeling of superconductors by finite-element method (FEM) is
usually based on a power-law resistivity for their electrical behavior. The
implementation of such constitutive law in conventional models of electrical
machines is quite problematic: the magnetic vector potential directly gives the
electric field and requires using a power-law depending on it. This power-law
is a non-bounded function that can generate enormous uneven values in low
electric field regions that can destroy the reliability of solutions. The
method proposed here consists in separating the model of an electrical machine
in two parts, where the magnetic field is calculated with the most appropriate
formulation: the H-formulation in the part containing the superconductors and
the A-formulation in the part containing conventional conductors (and possibly
permanent magnets). The main goal of this work is to determine and to correctly
apply the continuity conditions on the boundary separating the two regions.
Depending on the location of such boundary -- in the fixed or rotating part of
the machine -- the conditions that one needs to apply are different. In
addition, the application of those conditions requires the use of Lagrange
multipliers satisfying the field transforms of the electromagnetic quantities
in the two reference systems, the fixed and the rotating one. In this article,
several exemplary cases for the possible configurations are presented. In order
to emphasize and capture the essential point of this modeling strategy, the
discussed examples are rather simple. Nevertheless, they constitute a solid
starting point for modeling more complex and realistic devices.
