studied using the rheological granular fluid model. The linear rheological
instability triggered by the interplay of the shear rheology and Keplerian
differential rotation of incompressible dense granular fluids is found.
Instability sets in granular fluids, where the viscosity parameter grows faster
than the square of the local shear rate (strain rate) at constant pressure.
Found instability can play a crucial role in the dynamics of dense planetary
rings and granular flows in protoplanetary disks.

rely on the magnitude of coefficient estimates to decide which variables to

perspective on variable selection is presented within a generalized fiducial
inference framework. This new procedure is able to effectively account for
linear dependencies among subsets of covariates in a high-dimensional setting
where $p$ can grow almost exponentially in $n$, as well as in the classical
setting where $p \le n$. It is shown that the procedure very naturally assigns
small probabilities to subsets of covariates which include redundancies by way
of explicit $L_{0}$ minimization. Furthermore, with a typical sparsity
assumption, it is shown that the proposed method is consistent in the sense
that the probability of the true sparse subset of covariates converges in
probability to 1 as $n \to \infty$, or as $n \to \infty$ and $p \to \infty$.
Very reasonable conditions are needed, and little restriction is placed on the
class of possible subsets of covariates to achieve this consistency result.

chaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering only
unbounded motion for several energy levels. The Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)
method is used for determining the regular or chaotic nature of the orbits. The
basins of escape are located and they are also correlated with the
corresponding escape time of the orbits. Areas of bounded regular or chaotic
motion and basins of escape were found to coexist in the $(x,z)$ plane. The
properties of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs), located in
the vicinity of the index-1 Lagrange points $L_1$ and $L_2$, are also explored.
These manifolds are of paramount importance as they control the flow of stars
over the saddle points, while they also trigger the formation of tidal tails
observed in star clusters. Bifurcation diagrams of the Lyapunov periodic orbits
as well as restrictions of the Poincar\'e map to the NHIMs are deployed for
elucidating the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the saddle points. The

matter and implies a wide discussion around different theoretical proposals. A
suitable conceptual scheme could be represented by gravity models that
naturally generalize Einstein Theory like higher order gravity theories and
higher dimensional ones. Both of these two different approaches allow to
define, at the effective level, Einstein field equations equipped with
source-like energy momentum tensors of geometrical origin. In this paper, it is
discussed the possibility to develop a five dimensional fourth order gravity
model whose lower dimensional reduction could provide an interpretation of
cosmological four dimensional matter-energy components. We describe the basic
concepts of the model, the complete field equations formalism and the 5-Dim to
4-Dim reduction procedure. Five dimensional $f(R)$ field equations turn out to
be equivalent, on the four dimensional hypersurfaces orthogonal to the
extra-coordinate, to an Einstein like cosmological model with three
matter-energy tensors related with higher derivative and higher dimensional
counter-terms. By considering a gravity model $f(R)=f_0R^n$ it is investigated
the possibility to obtain five dimensional power law solutions. The effective
four dimensional picture and the behaviour of the geometrically induced sources
are finally outlined in correspondence to simple cases of such higher
dimensional solutions.

clusters consisting of as many as tens or hundreds of thousands of machines. To
execute a complex computing task over a data center, it is natural to
distribute computations across many nodes to take advantage of parallel
processing. However, as we allocate more and more computing resources to a
computation task and further distribute the computations, large amounts of
(partially) computed data must be moved between consecutive stages of
computation tasks among the nodes, hence the communication load can become the
bottleneck. In this paper, we study the optimal allocation of computing
resources in distributed computing, in order to minimize the total execution
time in distributed computing accounting for both the duration of computation
and communication phases. In particular, we consider a general MapReduce-type
distributed computing framework, in which the computation is decomposed into
three stages: \emph{Map}, \emph{Shuffle}, and \emph{Reduce}. We focus on a
recently proposed \emph{Coded Distributed Computing} approach for MapReduce and
study the optimal allocation of computing resources in this framework. For all
values of problem parameters, we characterize the optimal number of servers
that should be used for distributed processing, provide the optimal placements
of the Map and Reduce tasks, and propose an optimal coded data shuffling
scheme, in order to minimize the total execution time. To prove the optimality
of the proposed scheme, we first derive a matching information-theoretic
converse on the execution time, then we prove that among all possible resource
allocation schemes that achieve the minimum execution time, our proposed scheme
uses the exactly minimum possible number of servers.

temporal evolution, will be proposed for achieving asymptotic convergence
toward a periodic motion. For planar bipeds with one degree of underactuation,
it is known that a vertical displacement of the center of mass---with downward
velocity at the step transition---induces stability of a walking gait. This
paper concerns the qualitative extension of this type of property to 3D walking
with two degrees of underactuation. It is shown that a condition on the
position of the center of mass in the horizontal plane at the transition
between steps induces synchronization between the motions in the sagittal and
frontal planes. A combination of the conditions for self-synchronization and
vertical oscillations leads to stable gaits. The algorithm for
self-stabilization of 3D walking gaits is first developed for a simplified
model of a walking robot (an inverted pendulum with variable length legs), and
then it is extended to a complex model of the humanoid robot Romeo using the
notion of Hybrid Zero Dynamics. Simulations of the model of the robot
illustrate the efficacy of the method and its robustness.

segmentation performed by trained clinicians, which is taken as ground truth.
This project only takes part in the segmentation phase of the challenge. The
other phases of the competition (feature extraction and lesion identification)
are not considered.
  The proposed algorithm consists of 4 steps: (1) lesion image preprocessing,
(2) image segmentation using k-means clustering of pixel colors, (3)
calculation of a set of features describing the properties of each segmented
region, and (4) calculation of a final score for each region, representing the
likelihood of corresponding to a suitable lesion segmentation. The scores in
step (4) are obtained by averaging the results of 2 different regression models
using the scores of each region as input. Before using the algorithm these
regression models must be trained using the training set of images and ground
truth masks provided by the Competition. Steps 2 to 4 are repeated with an
increasing number of clusters (and therefore the image is segmented into more
regions) until there is no further improvement of the calculated scores.

binary, consisting of a primary black hole (BH) and a secondary Wolf-Rayet (WR)
star that are orbiting around each other, the spin period of the WR star can be
tidally synchronized to its orbital period. Then, the angular momentum of the
outer material of the WR star is large enough to form an accretion disk around
a newborn, secondary BH, following its core-collapse. This disk may produce an
energetic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\sim10^{50}-10^{52}$ erg and an
outflow velocity of $\sim10^{10}\rm~cm~s^{-1}$, resulting in an optical
transient with an absolute magnitude from $\sim -14$ to $\sim-17$ with a
duration of around a day. This type of transient also produces detectable radio
signals $\sim1-10$ years after the birth of BBHs, via synchrotron emission from
non-thermal electrons accelerated at external shocks. The predicted optical
transients have a shorter duration than ordinary core-collapse supernovae.
Dedicated optical transient surveys can detect them, and distinguish it from
ordinary SNe using the different features of its light curve and late-time
spectrum. In the paper I, we investigate disk-driven outflows from the
secondary BH, whereas possible signals from the primary BH will be discussed in

analyze the convergence of iterative methods in non-convex problems. It is a
common experience, however, that iterative maps fail to be globally contracting
under the natural metric in their domain, making the applicability of Banach's
theorem limited. We explore how generally we can apply Banach's fixed point
theorem to establish the convergence of iterative methods when pairing it with
carefully designed metrics.
  Our first result is a strong converse of Banach's theorem, showing that it is
a universal analysis tool for establishing global convergence of iterative
methods to unique fixed points, and for bounding their convergence rate. In
other words, we show that, whenever an iterative map globally converges to a
unique fixed point, there exists a metric under which the iterative map is
contracting and which can be used to bound the number of iterations until
convergence. We illustrate our approach in the widely used power method,
providing a new way of bounding its convergence rate through contraction
arguments.
  We next consider the computational complexity of Banach's fixed point
theorem. Making the proof of our converse theorem constructive, we show that
computing a fixed point whose existence is guaranteed by Banach's fixed point
theorem is CLS-complete. We thus provide the first natural complete problem for
the class CLS, which was defined in [Daskalakis, Papadimitriou 2011] to capture
the complexity of problems such as P-matrix LCP, computing KKT-points, and
finding mixed Nash equilibria in congestion and network coordination games.

unitarity relation for arbitrary partial waves. We show that obtaining a final
expression free from unphysical helicity partial waves is a subtle issue, which

validate the formalism extensively using the pion-box contribution, defined by
two-pion intermediate states with a pion-pole left-hand cut, and demonstrate
how the full known result is reproduced when resumming the partial waves. Using
dispersive fits to high-statistics data for the pion vector form factor, we
provide an evaluation of the full pion box,
$a_\mu^{\pi\text{-box}}=-15.9(2)\times 10^{-11}$. As an application of the
partial-wave formalism, we present a first calculation of $\pi\pi$-rescattering
effects in HLbL scattering, with $\gamma^*\gamma^*\to\pi\pi$ helicity partial
waves constructed dispersively using $\pi\pi$ phase shifts derived from the
inverse-amplitude method. In this way, the isospin-$0$ part of our calculation
can be interpreted as the contribution of the $f_0(500)$ to HLbL scattering in
$(g-2)_\mu$. We argue that the contribution due to charged-pion rescattering
implements corrections related to the corresponding pion polarizability and
show that these are moderate. Our final result for the sum of pion-box

$a_\mu^{\pi\text{-box}} + a_{\mu,J=0}^{\pi\pi,\pi\text{-pole LHC}}=-24(1)\times

of formation and age evolution of these systems. We further investigate the
possibility of exploiting this index as ""cosmic chronometer"", i.e. to derive
the Hubble parameter from its differential evolution with redshift, hence
constraining cosmological models independently of other probes. We find that
the H$\beta$ strength increases with redshift as expected in passive evolution
models, and shows at each redshift weaker values in more massive galaxies.
However, a detailed comparison of the observed index with the predictions of
stellar population synthesis models highlights a significant tension, with the
observed index being systematically lower than expected. By analyzing the
stacked spectra, we find a weak [NII]$\lambda6584$ emission line (not
detectable in the single spectra) which anti-correlates with the mass, that can
be interpreted as a hint of the presence of ionized gas. We estimated the
correction of the H$\beta$ index by the residual emission component exploiting
different approaches, but find it very uncertain and model-dependent. We
conclude that, while the qualitative trends of the observed H$\beta$-z
relations are consistent with the expected passive and downsizing scenario, the
possible presence of ionized gas even in the most massive and passive galaxies
prevents to use this index for a quantitative estimate of the age evolution and
for cosmological applications.

historically been based on uncertain assumptions. Here, we measure the mass,
momentum, and energy outflow rates of seven nearby star-forming galaxies using
ultraviolet absorption lines and observationally motivated estimates for the
density, metallicity, and radius of the outflow. Low-mass galaxies generate
outflows faster than their escape velocities with mass outflow rates up to
twenty times larger than their star formation rates. These outflows from
low-mass galaxies also have momenta larger than provided from supernovae alone,
indicating that multiple momentum sources drive these outflows. Only 1-20\% of
the supernovae energy is converted into kinetic energy, and this fraction
decreases with increasing stellar mass such that low-mass galaxies drive more
efficient outflows. We find scaling relations between the outflows and the
stellar mass of their host galaxies (M$_\ast$) at the 2-3$\sigma$ significance
level. The mass-loading factor, or the mass outflow rate divided by the star
formation rate, scales as M$_\ast^{-0.4}$ and with the circular velocity as
v$_\mathrm{circ}^{-1.6}$. The scaling of the mass-loading factor is similar to
recent simulations, but the observations are a factor of five smaller, possibly
indicating that there is a substantial amount of unprobed gas in a different
ionization phase. The outflow momenta are consistent with a model where star
formation drives the outflow while gravity counteracts this acceleration.

spectra by applying it to seven well-studied Galactic GCs that span a wide
range of metallicities. Integrated-light spectra were obtained by scanning the
slit of the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope across the
half-light diameters of the clusters. We modelled the spectra using resolved
HST colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), as well as theoretical isochrones, in
combination with standard stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes. The
abundances of Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ba were compared with literature data
for individual stars in the clusters. The typical differences between iron
abundances derived from our integrated-light spectra and those compiled from
the literature are less than 0.1 dex. A larger difference is found for one
cluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic
fluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As
expected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to
the Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar. When
using up-to-date line lists, our [Mg/Fe] ratios also agree well with literature
data. Our [Na/Fe] ratios are, on average, 0.08-0.14 dex lower than average
values quoted in the literature, and our [Ba/Fe] ratios may be overestimated by
0.20-0.35 dex at the lowest metallicities. We find that analyses based on
theoretical isochrones give very similar results to those based on resolved
CMDs. Overall, the agreement between our integrated-light abundance
measurements and the literature data is satisfactory. Refinements of the
modelling procedure, such as corrections for stellar evolutionary and non-LTE
effects, might further reduce some of the remaining offsets.

contrast to the implementations of other Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes,
ours uses co-moving reference frames that rely solely on the scattering
processes. It fully supports the peel-off mechanism that is crucial for the
efficient calculation of images in 3D Monte Carlo codes. We develop
reproducible test cases that push the limits of our code. The results of our
program are validated by comparison with analytically calculated solutions.
Additionally, we compare results of our code to previously published results.
We apply our method to models of dusty spiral galaxies at near-infrared and
optical wavelengths. We calculate polarization degree maps and show them to
contain signatures that trace characteristics of the dust arms independent of
the inclination or rotation of the galaxy.

Specifically, haloes with a virial mass of M_vir < 2 x 10^9 solar mass form>

importance of Population~III (Pop~III) stars, with their intrinsically high
$\rm [C/Fe]$ yields, and the associated external metal-enrichment, in producing
low-metallicity stars ($\rm [Fe/H]\lesssim-4$) and carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars. We find that UFDs are composite systems, assembled from multiple
progenitor haloes, some of which hosted only Population~II (Pop~II) stars
formed in environments externally enriched by SNe in neighboring haloes,
naturally producing, extremely low-metallicity Pop~II stars. We illustrate how
the simulated chemical enrichment may be used to constrain the star formation
histories (SFHs) of true observed UFDs. We find that Leo P analogs can form in
haloes with M_vir ~ 4 x 10^9 solar mass (z=0). Such systems are less affected
by reionization and continue to form stars until z=0, causing higher
metallicity tails. Finally, we predict the existence of extremely

SMBHs and galaxy properties suggest some connection or feedback between SMBH
growth and galaxy build-up. We looked for correlations between properties of
X-ray detected AGN and their FIR detected host galaxies, to find quantitative
evidences for this connection, highly debated in the latest years. We exploit
the rich multi-wavelength data set available in the COSMOS field for a large
sample (692 sources) of AGN and their hosts, in the redshift range $0.1<z<4$.
We use X-ray data to select AGN and determine their properties (intrinsic
luminosity and nuclear obscuration), and broad-band SED fitting to derive host
galaxy properties (stellar mass $M_*$ and star formation rate SFR). We find
that the AGN 2-10 keV luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) and the host $8-1000~\mu m$ star
formation luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}^{\rm SF}$) are significantly correlated.
However, the average host $L_{\rm IR}^{\rm SF}$ has a flat distribution in bins
of AGN $L_{\rm X}$, while the average AGN $L_{\rm X}$ increases in bins of host
$L_{\rm IR}^{\rm SF}$, with logarithmic slope of $\sim0.7$, in the redshifts
range $0.4<z<1.2$. We also discuss the comparison between the distribution of
these two quantities and the predictions from hydro-dynamical simulations.
Finally we find that the average column density ($N_H$) shows a positive
correlation with the host $M_*$, at all redshifts, but not with the SFR (or
$L_{\rm IR}^{\rm SF}$). This translates into a negative correlation with
specific SFR. Our results are in agreement with the idea that BH accretion and
SF rates are correlated, but occur with different variability time scales. The
presence of a positive correlation between $N_H$ and host $M_*$ suggests that
the X-ray $N_H$ is not entirely due to the circum-nuclear obscuring torus, but
may also include a contribution from the host galaxy.

usually assume the lightest neutralino to be the lightest supersymmetric
particle. In this paper we consider an alternative scenario in which the
left-handed tau sneutrino is lighter than neutralinos and stable at collider
scales, but possibly unstable at cosmological scales. Moreover the (mostly
right-handed) stop $\widetilde t$ is lighter than all electroweakinos, and
heavier than the scalars of the third generation doublet, whose charged
component, $\widetilde\tau$, is heavier than the neutral one, $\widetilde\nu$.
The remaining supersymmetric particles are decoupled from the stop
phenomenology. In most of the parameter space, the relevant stop decays are
only into $t \widetilde\tau \tau$, $t\widetilde\nu\nu$ and $b \widetilde\nu
\tau$ via off-shell electroweakinos. We constrain the branching ratios of these
decays by recasting the most sensitive stop searches. Due to the ""double

the low efficiency in tagging the $t\widetilde\tau\tau$ decay products, light
stops are generically allowed. In the minimal supersymmetric standard model

turn out to be allowed at 95% CL.

requires that neural activity controlling unaffected limbs is dissociated from
activity controlling the BCI. In this study we investigated how primary motor
cortex accomplishes simultaneous BCI control and motor control in a task that
explicitly required both activities to be driven from the same brain region
(i.e. a dual-control task). Single-unit activity was recorded from
intracortical, multi-electrode arrays while a non-human primate performed this
dual-control task. Compared to activity observed during naturalistic motor
control, we found that both units used to drive the BCI directly (control
units) and units that did not directly control the BCI (non-control units)
significantly changed their tuning to wrist torque. Using a measure of
effective connectivity, we observed that control units decrease their
connectivity. Through an analysis of variance we found that the intrinsic
variability of the control units has a significant effect on task proficiency.
When this variance is accounted for, motor cortical activity is flexible enough
to perform novel BCI tasks that require active decoupling of natural
associations to wrist motion. This study provides insight into the neural
activity that enables a dual-control brain-computer interface.

between the user and the computer. The main moto of hand gesture recognition
research is to create a system which can recognise specific hand gestures and
use them to convey useful information for device control. This paper presents
an experimental study over the feasibility of principal component analysis in
hand gesture recognition system. PCA is a powerful tool for analyzing data. The
primary goal of PCA is dimensionality reduction. Frames are extracted from the
Sheffield KInect Gesture (SKIG) dataset. The implementation is done by creating
a training set and then training the recognizer. It uses Eigen space by
processing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the images in training set.
Euclidean distance with the threshold value is used as similarity metric to
recognize the gestures. The experimental results show that PCA is feasible to
be used for hand gesture recognition system.

network-wide reachability invariants on the data plane. To be useful in
practice, these violations need to be detected in the order of milliseconds,
without raising false alarms. To date, most real-time data plane checkers
address this problem by exploiting at least one of the following two
observations: (i) only small parts of the network tend to be affected by
typical changes to the data plane, and (ii) many different packets tend to
share the same forwarding behaviour in the entire network. This paper shows how
to effectively exploit a third characteristic of the problem, namely:
similarity among forwarding behaviour of packets through parts of the network,

libration in longitude, the actual spectrum of Fourier tidal modes differs from
the conventional spectrum rendered by the Darwin-Kaula theory for a
non-librating celestial object. This necessitates derivation of formulae for
the tidal torque and the tidal heating rate, that are applicable under
libration.
  We derive the tidal spectrum for longitudinal forced libration with one and
two main frequencies, generalisation to more main frequencies being
straightforward. (By main frequencies we understand those emerging due to the
triaxiality of the librating body.) Separately, we consider a case of free
libration at one frequency (once again, generalisation to more frequencies
being straightforward).
  We also calculate the tidal torque. This torque provides correction to the
triaxiality-caused physical libration. Our theory is not self-consistent: we
assume that the tidal torque is much smaller than the
permanent-triaxiality-caused torque; so the additional libration due to tides
is much weaker than the main libration due to the permanent triaxiality.
  Finally, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate in a body experiencing
forced libration at the main mode, or free libration at one frequency, or
superimposed forced and free librations.

medium, which acts as a star-forming gas reservoir, are uncertain in extremely
metal-poor galaxies. Our objective is to identify the heating mechanisms in one
such galaxy, IZw18, and assess the diagnostic value of fine-structure cooling
lines. We also seek to constrain the mass of H$_2$, which, despite being an
important catalyst and tracer of star formation, remains elusive in this
object. Building on a previous photoionization model within a multi-sector
topology, we provide additional constraints from the [CII] and [OI] lines and
the dust mass recently measured with Herschel. The heating of the HI region
appears to be mainly due to photoionization by radiation from a bright X-ray
binary source, while photoelectric effect (PE) is negligible. The [CII] and
[OI] lines imply an average X-ray luminosity of $4\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
while the [NeV] upper limits bring strong constraints to the soft X-ray flux
arising from the binary. A negligible amount of H$_2$ is predicted, but
$\lesssim10^7$ M$_\odot$ of H$_2$ may be hidden in sufficiently dense clouds of
order $\lesssim10$ pc in size. Regardless of the presence of significant
amounts of H$_2$, [CII] and [OI] do not trace the so-called CO-dark gas, but
the almost purely atomic medium. Although the [CII]+[OI]/TIR ratio is close to
values found in more metal-rich sources, it cannot be safely used as a PE
heating efficiency proxy. This ratio seems to be kept stable due to a
correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the star-formation rate. We
propose that X-ray heating is an important process in extremely metal-poor
sources. The weak PE heating due to the low dust-to-gas ratio could be
compensated for by the larger occurrence and power of X-ray binaries in
low-metallicity galaxies. We speculate that X-ray heating may quench star
formation.

Recent studies have successfully demonstrated the use of convolutional neural

However, there has been comparatively little success in high-throughput

connectivity graphs.
  In this study, we take a compositional approach to segmenting synapses,
modeling them explicitly as an intercellular cleft co-located with an
asymmetric vesicle density along a cell membrane. Instead of requiring a deep
network to learn all natural combinations of this compositionality, we train
lighter networks to model the simpler marginal distributions of membranes,
clefts and vesicles from just 100 electron microscopy samples. These feature
maps are then combined with simple rules-based heuristics derived from prior
biological knowledge.
  Our approach to synapse detection is both more accurate than previous
state-of-the-art (7% higher recall and 5% higher F1-score) and yields a 20-fold
speed-up compared to the previous fastest implementations. We demonstrate by
reconstructing the first complete, directed connectome from the largest

exploit the high temporal resolution and the asynchronous nature of the sensor
are required. Recent work has shown that a continuous-time representation of

fundamental operation that can improve performance on a multitude of
personalization and ranking tasks. Strong-tie edges are often readily obtained
from the social network as users often participate in multiple overlapping
networks via features such as following and messaging. These networks may vary
greatly in size, density and the information they carry. This setting leads to
a natural strong tie detection task: given a small set of labeled strong tie
edges, how well can one detect unlabeled strong ties in the remainder of the
network?
  This task becomes particularly daunting for the Twitter network due to scant
availability of pairwise relationship attribute data, and sparsity of strong
tie networks such as phone contacts. Given these challenges, a natural approach
is to instead use structural network features for the task, produced by {\em
combining} the strong and ""weak"" edges. In this work, we demonstrate via
experiments on Twitter data that using only such structural network features is
sufficient for detecting strong ties with high precision. These structural
network features are obtained from the presence and frequency of small network
motifs on combined strong and weak ties. We observe that using motifs larger
than triads alleviate sparsity problems that arise for smaller motifs, both due
to increased combinatorial possibilities as well as benefiting strongly from
searching beyond the ego network. Empirically, we observe that not all motifs
are equally useful, and need to be carefully constructed from the combined
edges in order to be effective for strong tie detection. Finally, we reinforce
our experimental findings with providing theoretical justification that

in the probability distribution of a particle, known as ""quantum carpets"",
corresponding to the revival and replication of the initial wave function.
Recently, it was shown that one can encode a $D$-level qudit, in such a way
that the Talbot effect can be used to process the $D$-dimensional quantum
information [Far\'{\i}as et al, PRA (2015)]. Here we introduce a scheme to
produce free-propagating ""entangled quantum carpets"" with pairs of photons
produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. First we introduce an
optical device that can be used to synthesize arbitrary superposition states of
Talbot qudits. Sending spatially entangled photon pairs through a pair of these
devices produces an entangled pair of qudits. As an application, we show how
the Talbot effect can be used to test a $D$-dimensional Bell inequality.
Numerical simulations show that violation of the Bell inequality depends
strongly on the amount of spatial correlation in the initial two-photon state.
We briefly discuss how our optical scheme might be adapted to matter wave
experiments.

generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in
an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater
images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture
high resolution images to map the seafloor, however, underwater image formation
is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water
column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images
taken in air due to effects such as absorption and scattering, which cause
attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this
physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many
parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the objects in the scene.
These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying
assumptions or field calibration, hence, restoration of underwater images is a
non-trivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling
complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which
is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a
large training dataset of paired imagery, both raw underwater and true color
in-air, as well as depth data. This data serves as input to a novel end-to-end
network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Due to the
depth-dependent water column effects inherent to underwater environments, we
show that our end-to-end network implicitly learns a coarse depth estimate of
the underwater scene from monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is
validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water tank and
from underwater surveys in field testing. Source code is made publicly

\mathbb{R}^d$, the \emph{spherical depth} $\SphD(q;F)$ is defined to be the
probability that a point $q$ is contained inside a random closed hyper-ball
obtained from a pair of points from $F$. The spherical depth $\SphD(q;S)$ is
also defined for an arbitrary data set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\in
\mathbb{R}^d$. This definition is based on counting all of the closed
hyper-balls, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The
significant advantage of using the spherical depth in multivariate data
analysis is related to its complexity of computation. Unlike most other data
depths, the time complexity of the spherical depth grows linearly rather than
exponentially in the dimension $d$. The straightforward algorithm for computing
the spherical depth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. The main result of this
paper is an optimal algorithm that we present for computing the bivariate
spherical depth. The algorithm takes $O(n \log n)$ time. By reducing the
problem of \textit{Element Uniqueness}, we prove that computing the spherical
depth requires $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. Some geometric properties of spherical
depth are also investigated in this paper. These properties indicate that
\emph{simplicial depth} ($\SD$) (Liu, 1990) is linearly bounded by spherical
depth (in particular, $\SphD\geq \frac{2}{3}SD$). To illustrate this
relationship between the spherical depth and the simplicial depth, some
experimental results are provided. The obtained experimental bound ($\SphD\geq
2\SD$) indicates that, perhaps, a stronger theoretical bound can be achieved.

efficient algorithms to fit models with a non-convex $\ell_\gamma$ penalty for

lasso penalty, but is harder to fit. We propose an alternative, termed the
horseshoe regularization penalty for feature subset selection, and demonstrate
its theoretical and computational advantages. The distinguishing feature from
existing non-convex optimization approaches is a full probabilistic
representation of the penalty as the negative of the logarithm of a suitable
prior, which in turn enables efficient expectation-maximization and local
linear approximation algorithms for optimization and MCMC for uncertainty
quantification. In synthetic and real data, the resulting algorithms provide
better statistical performance, and the computation requires a fraction of time

millimeter data directly to find diameters and thus volumes for these bodies.
In addition, we find that when including the effects of model uncertainty, the
true uncertainties on the sizes of outer solar system objects measured with
radiometry are likely larger than those previously published. Substantial
improvement in object sizes will likely require precise occultation
measurements.

modelling and non-linear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in
SNRs. We include consistent numerical treatment of magnetic field amplification
(MFA) due to resonant streaming instability. Under the assumption that SNR
G1.9+0.3 is the result of a Type Ia supernova explosion located near the
Galactic Centre, using widely accepted values for explosion energy 10$^{51}$
erg and ejecta mass 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, the non-thermal continuum radio emission
is calculated. The main purpose of this paper is to explain radio flux
brightening measured over recent decades and also predict its future temporal
evolution. We estimate that the SNR is now $\sim$ 120 yr old, expanding in an
ambient density of 0.02 cm$^{-3}$, and explain its steep radio spectral index
only by means of efficient non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA). We
also make comparison between simulations and observations of this young SNR, in
order to test the models and assumptions suggested. Our model prediction of a
radio flux density increase of $\sim$ 1.8 per cent yr$^{-1}$ during the past
two decades agrees well with the measured values. We synthesize the synchrotron
spectrum from radio to X-ray and it fits well the VLA, MOST, Effelsberg,
Chandra and NuSTAR measurements. We also propose a simplified evolutionary
model of the SNR in gamma rays and suggest it may be a promising target for
gamma-ray observations at TeV energies with the future generation of
instruments like Cherenkov Telescope Array. SNR G1.9+0.3 is the only known
Galactic SNR with the increasing flux density and we present here the
prediction that the flux density will start to decrease approximately 500 yr
from now. We conclude that this is a general property of SNRs in free expansion
phase.

both humans and animal populations. Identifying the source of food-borne
zoonoses (e.g. an animal reservoir or food product) is crucial for the
identification and prioritisation of food safety interventions. For many
zoonotic diseases it is difficult to attribute human cases to sources of
infection because there is little epidemiological information on the cases.
However, microbial strain typing allows zoonotic pathogens to be categorised,
and the relative frequencies of the strain types among the sources and in human
cases allows inference on the likely source of each infection. We introduce
sourceR, an R package for quantitative source attribution, aimed at food-borne
diseases. It implements a fully joint Bayesian model using strain-typed
surveillance data from both human cases and source samples, capable of
identifying important sources of infection. The model measures the force of
infection from each source, allowing for varying survivability, pathogenicity
and virulence of pathogen strains, and varying abilities of the sources to act
as vehicles of infection. A Bayesian non-parametric (Dirichlet process)
approach is used to cluster pathogen strain types by epidemiological behaviour,
avoiding model overfitting and allowing detection of strain types associated
with potentially high 'virulence'.
  sourceR is demonstrated using Campylobacter jejuni isolate data collected in
New Zealand between 2005 and 2008. It enables straightforward attribution of
cases of zoonotic infection to putative sources of infection by epidemiologists
and public health decision makers. As sourceR develops, we intend it to become
an important and flexible resource for food-borne disease attribution studies.

comparable degree of correlation of the firing activity of the biological

distinct populations connected by the equivalent of interneurons, is triggered
more effectively by adding multiple synapses to the connections than increasing
the number of independent point-to-point connections. The comparison between
the biological and the artificial systems suggests that a considerable number
of synapses is active also in biological populations adhering to engineered

systems to dynamically acquire and release shared computational resources on
demand. Moreover, it unfolds the advantage of economies of scale in the cloud
through a drop in the average costs of these shared resources. However, it is
still an open challenge to achieve a perfect match between resource demand and
provision in autonomous elasticity management. Resource adaptation decisions
essentially involve a trade-off between economics and performance, which
produces a gap between the ideal and actual resource provisioning. This gap, if
not properly managed, can negatively impact the aggregate utility of a cloud
customer in the long run. To address this limitation, we propose a technical
debt-aware learning approach for autonomous elasticity management based on a
reinforcement learning of elasticity debts in resource provisioning; the
adaptation pursues strategic decisions that trades off economics against
performance. We extend CloudSim and Burlap to evaluate our approach. The
evaluation shows that a reinforcement learning of technical debts in elasticity
obtains a higher utility for a cloud customer, while conforming expected levels

research interest. Given a set of vertices $V$, we want to find a subset of
vertices $S$, called centers, such that the maximum cluster radius is
minimized. Moreover, each center in $S$ should satisfy some capacity
constraint, which could be an upper or lower bound on the number of vertices it
can serve. Capacitated $k$-center problems with one-sided bounds (upper or
lower) have been well studied in previous work, and a constant factor
approximation was obtained.
  We are the first to study the capacitated center problem with both capacity
lower and upper bounds (with or without outliers). We assume each vertex has a
uniform lower bound and a non-uniform upper bound. For the case of opening
exactly $k$ centers, we note that a generalization of a recent LP approach can
achieve constant factor approximation algorithms for our problems. Our main
contribution is a simple combinatorial algorithm for the case where there is no
cardinality constraint on the number of open centers. Our combinatorial
algorithm is simpler and achieves better constant approximation factor compared
to the LP approach.

a number of computing applications. However, despite the fact that physical
activity is essential for a healthy lifestyle, surprisingly little is known
about how gamification and in particular competitions shape human physical
activity. Here we study how competitions affect physical activity. We focus on
walking challenges in a mobile activity tracking application where multiple
users compete over who takes the most steps over a predefined number of days.
We synthesize our findings in a series of game and app design implications. In
particular, we analyze nearly 2,500 physical activity competitions over a
period of one year capturing more than 800,000 person days of activity
tracking. We observe that during walking competitions, the average user
increases physical activity by 23%. Furthermore, there are large increases in
activity for both men and women across all ages, and weight status, and even
for users that were previously fairly inactive. We also find that the
composition of participants greatly affects the dynamics of the game. In
particular, if highly unequal participants get matched to each other, then
competition suffers and the overall effect on the physical activity drops
significantly. Furthermore, competitions with an equal mix of both men and
women are more effective in increasing the level of activities. We leverage
these insights to develop a statistical model to predict whether or not a
competition will be particularly engaging with significant accuracy. Our models
can serve as a guideline to help design more engaging competitions that lead to
most beneficial behavioral changes.

lator does not affect the phase boundary between the normal and superradiant
phases. However, the superradiant phase collapses by the resonant damping of
the oscillator when the atom-field coupling increases to a so-called turning
point. As a consequence the system undergoes at this point an additional phase
transition from the superradiant phase to a new normal phase of the atomic
population-inversion state. The region of superradiant phase decreases with the
increase of photon-phonon coupling. It shrinks to zero at a critical value of
the coupling and a direct atomic population transfer appears between two
atom-levels. Moreover we find an unstable nonzero-photon state, which is the
counterpart of the superradiant state. In the absence of oscillator our result
re- duces exactly to that of Dicke model. Particularly the ground-state energy
for N = 1 (i.e. the Rabi model) is in perfect agreement with the numerical
diagonalization in a wide region of coupling constant for both red and blue

coherent unidirectional motion of magnetic bubbles, driven by a tilted
alternating magnetic field. The tilted alternating magnetic field induces
asymmetric expansion and shrinkage of the magnetic bubbles under the influence
of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, resulting in continuous shift of the
bubbles in time. By realizing the magnetic bubblecade in PtCoPt films, we find
that the bubblecade speed is sensitive to the tilt angle with a maximum at an
angle, which can be explained well by a simple analytical form within the
context of the domain-wall creep theory. A simplified analytic formula for the

solutions of the rotating Euler equations provided by the large Coriolis force.
In this case the resonant equation does not appear anymore. In the periodic

Research in this direction was initiated by Babin, Mahalov and Nicolaenko

bursting dynamics of the resonant equation in the case of a cylinder with no

strictly less than the usual Laplacian) in the periodic domain with the same

application, we use our new algorithm to solve an adaptive pricing problem.
Specifically, we consider the case of a single seller faced with a stream of

expression remain similar at different time points. Al- though these analyses
may help delineate gene regulation either spatially or temporally, they are not

parameter of the UV photons escaping upstream. This parameter determines both
the temperature and the degree of ionisation of the gas entering the shock. In
increasing velocity the shock solution regimes are cold neutral precursors

push these velocity ranges to higher values, and to limit the post-shock
compression. In order to facilitate comparison with observations of shocks, we
provide a number of convenient scaling relationships for parameters such as

searches on encrypted data. Using the predicate encryption, we can search
keywords or attributes on encrypted data without decrypting the ciphertexts. In
predicate encryption, a ciphertext is associated with attributes and a token
corresponds to a predicate. The token that corresponds to a predicate $f$ can
decrypt the ciphertext associated with attributes $x$ if and only if $f(x)=1$.
Hidden vector encryption (HVE) is a special kind of predicate encryption. In
this thesis, we consider the efficiency, the generality, and the security of
HVE schemes. The results of this thesis are described as follows.
  The first results of this thesis are efficient HVE schemes where the token
consists of just four group elements and the decryption only requires four
bilinear map computations, independent of the number of attributes in the
ciphertext. The construction uses composite order bilinear groups and is
selectively secure under the well-known assumptions. The second results are
efficient HVE schemes that are secure under any kind of pairing types. To
achieve our goals, we proposed a general framework that converts HVE schemes
from composite order bilinear groups to prime order bilinear groups. Using the
framework, we convert the previous HVE schemes from composite order bilinear
groups to prime order bilinear groups. The third results are fully secure HVE
schemes with short tokens. Previous HVE schemes were proven to be secure only
in the selective security model where the capabilities of the adversaries are
severely restricted. Using the dual system encryption techniques, we construct
fully secure HVE schemes with match revealing property in composite order
groups.

the hidden structure beneath. Likewise, by reducing the strength of the hidden

  Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that HICODE
outperforms several state-of-the-art community detection methods in uncovering

promising approach to pinpoint the existing latent communities and uncover
communities for which there is no ground truth. Finding this unknown structure

providing significant improvements in classification accuracy in the presence
of highly-structured and large databases.
  Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning.
Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being
processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users'
private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions,
interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive
information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem,
collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties
locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the
parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private.
Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make
information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and
Shmatikov at CCS'15.
  Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep
learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In
particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep
learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training
sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time
nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted
training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are
intended to come from the same distribution as the training data).
Interestingly, we show that record-level DP applied to the shared parameters of
the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP
is not designed to address our attack).

2-10 m, and hybrid arrays that combine small-aperture telescopes (0.5 m
diameter) with large-aperture telescopes. We explore performance as a function
of the telescope aperture size, the distribution of the detectors into
different microwave frequencies, the survey strategy and survey area, the
low-frequency noise performance, and the balance between small and large
aperture telescopes for the hybrid configurations. We also examine the impact
from the uncertainties of the instrumental model. There are several areas that
deserve further improvement. In our forecasting framework, we adopt a simple
two-component foregrounds model with spacially varying power-law spectral
indices. We estimate delensing performance statistically and ignore possible
non-idealities. Instrumental systematics, which is not accounted for in our
study, may influence the design. Further study of the instrumental and cost

Recently proposed trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion (TNRD) model defines a
simple but very effective framework for image denoising. However, as the TNRD
model is a local model, the diffusion behavior of which is purely controlled by
information of local patches, it is prone to create artifacts in the homogenous
regions and over-smooth highly textured regions, especially in the case of
strong noise levels. Meanwhile, it is widely known that the non-local
self-similarity (NSS) prior stands as an effective image prior for image
denoising, which has been widely exploited in many non-local methods. In this
work, we are highly motivated to embed the NSS prior into the TNRD model to
tackle its weaknesses. In order to preserve the expected property that
end-to-end training is available, we exploit the NSS prior by a set of
non-local filters, and derive our proposed trainable non-local reaction
diffusion (TNLRD) model for image denoising. Together with the local filters
and influence functions, the non-local filters are learned by employing
loss-specific training. The experimental results show that the trained TNLRD

Lemvig \cite{JL}, this article generalizes latest results on reproducing
formulas for generalized translation invariant (GTI) systems to the setting of
super-spaces over a second countable locally compact abelian (LCA) group $G$.
To do so, we introduce the notion of a super-GTI system with finite sequences
as generators from a super-space $L^2(G) \oplus \cdots \oplus L^2(G) $ ($N$
summands). We characterize the generators of two super-GTI systems in the
super-space such that they form a super-dual frame pair. For this, we first
give necessary and sufficient conditions for two Bessel families to be
orthogonal frames (we call as GTI-orthogonal frame systems) when the Bessel
families have the form of GTI systems in $L^2(G)$. As a consequence, we deduce
similar results for several function systems including the case of TI systems,
and GTI systems on compact abelian groups. As an application, we apply our
duality result for super-GTI systems to the Bessel families with a wave-packet
structure (combination of wavelet as well as Gabor structure), and hence a
characterization for dual super wave-packet systems on LCA groups is obtained.
In addition, we relate the well established theory from literature with our
results by observing several deductions in context of wavelet and Gabor systems
over LCA groups with $G=\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{Z}^d$, etc.

with many important real-world applications, including human-robot

standard device widely used by intelligent robots for 3D perception, which can
also offer human skeletal data in 3D space. Several methods based on skeletal
data were designed to enable robot awareness of human actions with satisfactory
accuracy. However, previous methods treated all body parts and features equally
important, without the capability to identify discriminative body parts and
features. In this paper, we propose a novel simultaneous Feature And Body-part
Learning (FABL) approach that simultaneously identifies discriminative body
parts and features, and efficiently integrates all available information
together to enable real-time robot awareness of human behaviors. We formulate
FABL as a regression-like optimization problem with structured
sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of body parts and features.
We also develop an optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem,
which possesses a theoretical guarantee to find the optimal solution. To
evaluate FABL, three experiments were performed using public benchmark
datasets, including the MSR Action3D and CAD-60 datasets, as well as a Baxter
robot in practical assistive living applications. Experimental results show
that our FABL approach obtains a high recognition accuracy with a processing
speed of the order-of-magnitude of 10e4 Hz, which makes FABL a promising method
to enable real-time robot awareness of human behaviors in practical robotics
applications.

recent years, predominant state-of-the-art approaches for despeckling are
usually based on nonlocal methods which mainly concentrate on achieving utmost
image restoration quality, with relatively low computational efficiency.
Therefore, in this study we aim to propose an efficient despeckling model with
both high computational efficiency and high recovery quality. To this end, we
exploit a newly-developed trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion(TNRD)
framework which has proven a simple and effective model for various image
restoration problems. {In the original TNRD applications, the diffusion network
is usually derived based on the direct gradient descent scheme. However, this
approach will encounter some problem for the task of multiplicative noise
reduction exploited in this study. To solve this problem, we employed a new
architecture derived from the proximal gradient descent method.} {Taking into
account the speckle noise statistics, the diffusion process for the despeckling
task is derived. We then retrain all the model parameters in the presence of
speckle noise. Finally, optimized nonlinear diffusion filtering models are
obtained, which are specialized for despeckling with various noise levels.
Experimental results substantiate that the trained filtering models provide
comparable or even better results than state-of-the-art nonlocal approaches.
Meanwhile, our proposed model merely contains convolution of linear filters
with an image, which offers high level parallelism on GPUs. As a consequence,
for images of size $512 \times 512$, our GPU implementation takes less than 0.1
seconds to produce state-of-the-art despeckling performance.}

constituents that exhibit counteracting effects on their equilibrium. In this
study, we employ these few characteristics to lay the groundwork for analyzing
such complex systems. The equilibrium point of these systems is generally
studied either through the kinetic notion of equilibrium or its energetic
notion, but not both. We postulate that these systems attempt to regulate the
state vector of their constituents such that both the kinetic and the energetic
notions of equilibrium are met. Based on this postulate, we prove: 1) the
existence of a point such that the kinetic notion of equilibrium is met for the
less abundant constituents and, at the same time, the state vector of more
abundant entities is regulated to minimize the energetic notion of equilibrium;
2) the effect of unboundedly increasing less (more) abundant constituents
stabilizes (destabilizes) the system; and 3) the (unrestricted) equilibrium of
the system is the point at which the number of stabilizing and destabilizing
entities increase unboundedly with the same rate.

studied in recent years, although the photoexcited carrier dynamics is still
far from being completely understood. Different experimental approaches imply
either one of two fundamentally different scattering mechanisms for hot
electrons. One is high-energy optical phonons, while the other is
disorder-driven supercollisions with acoustic phonons. However, the concurrent
relaxation via both optical and acoustic phonons has not been considered so
far, hindering the interpretation of different experiments within a unified
framework. Here we expand the optical phonon-mediated cooling model, to include
electron scattering with the acoustic phonons. By assuming the enhancement of
electron-acoustic phonon supercollisions from the localized defect at the
photothermoelectric current-generating interface, we provide a broader
perspective to the ultrafast photoresponse of graphene, highlighting the
previously overlooked effect of the interface for cooling dynamics. We show
that the transient photothermoelectric response, which has been attributed
exclusively to supercollisions, can be successfully explained without rejecting
the established optical phonon relaxation pathway, demonstrating that the two
cooling mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but complement each other.

if and only if $G$ is a cograph, that is, if no quadruple of vertices induces a
simple connected path $P_4$. The cograph editing problem consists in inserting
into and deleting from $G$ a set $F$ of edges so that $H=(V,E\Delta F)$ is a
cograph and $|F|$ is minimum. This NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem
has recently found applications, e.g., in the context of phylogenetics.
Efficient heuristics are hence of practical importance. The simple
characterization of cographs in terms of their modular decomposition suggests
that instead of editing $G$ one could operate directly on the modular
decomposition. We show here that editing the induced $P_4$s is equivalent to
resolving prime modules by means of a suitable defined merge operation on the
submodules. Moreover, we characterize so-called module-preserving edit sets and
demonstrate that optimal pairwise sequences of module-preserving edit sets
exist for every non-cograph. This eventually leads to an exact algorithm for
the cograph editing problem as well as fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) results
when cograph editing is parameterized by the so-called modular-width. In
addition, we provide two heuristics with time complexity $O(|V|^3)$, resp.,

described to validate cluster membership of identified ambiguous potential

Electrostatically confined conduction band electrons define interacting quantum
coherent spin and charge degrees of freedom that allow all-electrical
pure-state initialisation and readily adhere to an engineerable Fermi-Hubbard
Hamiltonian. Until now, however, the substantial electrostatic disorder
inherent to solid state has made attempts at emulating Fermi-Hubbard physics on

homogeneously and independently dial in the electron filling and
nearest-neighbour tunnel coupling. Bringing these ideas and tools to fruition,
we realize the first detailed characterization of the collective Coulomb

candidates is a [CII] emitter, we derive a lower limit of [CII]-based star
formation rate density (SFRD) at $z~\sim~6$. The resulting value of $> 10^{-2}$

SFRD. Future millimeter/submillimeter surveys can be used to detect a number of
high redshift line emitters, with which to study the star formation history in

recent research efforts are actively seeking countermeasures to SGX
side-channel attacks. It is widely assumed that SGX may be vulnerable to other

an attack that is hard to mitigate using known defenses, and therefore we mount
our attack without interrupting enclave execution. This approach has major
technical challenges, since the existing cache monitoring techniques experience
significant noise if the victim process is not interrupted. We designed and
implemented novel attack techniques to reduce this noise by leveraging the
capabilities of the privileged adversary. Our attacks are able to recover
confidential information from SGX enclaves, which we illustrate in two example

detection of specific human genome sequences during genomic indexing. We show
that our attacks are more effective than previous cache attacks and harder to

stars the young Sun was more active and probably produced enough high energy
particles to explain those anomalies. We want to study the interaction of
stellar energetic particles with the gas component of the disk and identify
possible observational tracers of this interaction. We use a 2D radiation
thermo-chemical protoplanetary disk code to model a disk representative for T
Tauri stars. We use a particle energy distribution derived from solar flare

For this particle spectrum we calculate the stellar particle ionization rate

impact on the abundances of the common disk ionization tracers HCO$^+$ and
N$_2$H$^+$, especially in models with low cosmic-ray ionization rates. In
contrast to cosmic rays and X-rays, stellar particles cannot reach the midplane
of the disk. Therefore molecular ions residing in the disk surface layers are
more affected by stellar particle ionization than molecular ions tracing the
cold layers/midplane of the disk. Spatially resolved observations of molecular

acceleration processes in cosmic ray sources is an important quantity relevant
for several aspects of the modeling of the sources themselves. It is usually
assumed to be around 1:100 in the case of Galactic sources, while a value of
1:10 is typically assumed when describing extragalactic sources. It is
supported by observations that the average ratios should be close to these
values. At this point, however, there is no possibility to investigate how each
individual source behaves. When looking at the physics aspects, a 1:100 ratio
is well supported in theory when making the following assumptions: (1) the
total number of electrons and protons that is accelerated are the same; (2) the
spectral index of both populations after acceleration is $a_e=a_p\approx 2.2$.
In this paper, we reinvestigate these assumptions. In particular, assumption
(2) is not supported by observational data of the sources and PIC simulation
yield different spectral indices as well. We present the detailed calculation
of the electron-to-proton ratio, dropping the assumption of equal spectral
indices. We distinguish between the ratio of luminosities and the ratio of the
differential spectral behavior, which becomes necessary for cases where the
spectral indices of the two particle populations are not the same. We discuss
the possible range of values when allowing for different spectral indices
concerning the spectral behavior of electrons and protons. Additionally, it is
shown that the minimum energy of the accelerated population can have a large
influence on the results.

mid-$J$ line emission of CO. The physical conditions of SMGs probably render
the diffusion of cosmic-ray electrons inefficient, and hence an unlikely
process to lead to the observed extended radio sizes. Instead, our results
point towards a scenario where SMGs are driven by galaxy interactions and
mergers. Besides triggering vigorous starbursts, galaxy collisions can also
pull out the magnetised fluids from the interacting disks, and give rise to a
taffy-like synchrotron-emitting bridge. This provides an explanation for the
spatially extended radio emission of SMGs, and can also cause a deviation from

sufficiently large vertical (base) magnetic field can inhibit the development

solution to the magnetic RT problem in the Hadamard sense. This shows that the
RT instability still occurs when the strength of base magnetic field is small

cell. Moreover, by analyzing the stability condition in magnetic RT problem for
vertical magnetic fields, we can observe that the compressibility destroys the
stabilizing effect of magnetic fields in the vertical direction. Fortunately,

effect of pressure, which also plays an important role in the mathematical
proof for stability of the magnetic RT problem. In addition, we will extend the

establish yet another new class of arbitrarily large quantum halos formed by
spinless bosons with short-range interactions in two dimensions. When the
two-body interaction is absent but the three-body interaction is resonant, four
bosons exhibit an infinite tower of bound states whose spatial extensions scale
as $R_n\sim e^{(\pi n)^2/27}$ for a large $n$. The emergent scaling law is
universal and is termed a semisuper Efimov effect, which together with the
Efimov and super Efimov effects constitutes a trio of few-body universality

the general constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization

computationally efficient interpretation of a generic dataset (e.g. in terms of
pairwise dependences) - as in statistical learning - or because they capture
the essential ingredients of a specific phenomenon - as e.g. in physics -
leading to non-trivial falsifiable predictions. In information theory and
Bayesian inference, the simplicity of a model is precisely quantified in the
stochastic complexity, which measures the number of bits needed to encode its
parameters. In order to understand how simple models look like, we study the
stochastic complexity of spin models with interactions of arbitrary order. We
highlight the existence of invariances with respect to bijections within the
space of operators, which allow us to partition the space of all models into
equivalence classes, in which models share the same complexity. We thus found
that the complexity (or simplicity) of a model is not determined by the order
of the interactions, but rather by their mutual arrangements. Models where
statistical dependencies are localized on non-overlapping groups of few
variables (and that afford predictions on independencies that are easy to
falsify) are simple. On the contrary, fully connected pairwise models, which
are often used in statistical learning, appear to be highly complex, because of
their extended set of interactions.

for thermal gradients above the Kondo temperature, showing a remarkably good
agreement despite their different ranges of validity. The third technique
allows us to analyze the full density of states within a wide range of
energies. Additionally, we have investigated the quantum transport properties
(electric current and thermocurrent) beyond linear response. In the
voltage-driven case, we reproduce the split differential conductance due to the
presence of different electrochemical potentials. In the temperature-driven

constraints on the lens mass profile. In addition, the magnified background
source also enable us to probe high-z galaxies with enhanced spatial resolution
and higher S/N, which is otherwise not possible for un-lensed galaxy studies.
Despite their usefulness, only a handful of Einstein rings have been reported
so far, mainly by serendipitous discoveries or visual inspections of hundred
thousands of massive galaxies or galaxy clusters. With the on-going and
forth-coming large area surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, visual
inspection to discover Einstein rings is very difficult, and an automated
approach to identify ring pattern in the big data to come is in high demand.
Here we present an Einstein ring recognition approach based on computer vision
techniques. The workhorse is the circle Hough transform, which can recognize
circular patterns or arcs at any position with any radius in the images. We
devise a two-tier approach: first pre-select LRGs associated with multiple blue
objects as possible lens galaxies, then feed these possible lenses to Hough
transform. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate our approach using the Sloan
Digital Sky Surveys. Our results show high completeness, albeit low purity. We
also apply our approach to three newly discovered Einstein rings/arcs, in the
DES, HSC-SSP, and UltraVISTA survey, illustrating the versatility of our
approach to on-going and up-coming large sky surveys in general. The beauty of
our approach is that it is solely based on JPEG images, which can be easily
obtained in batch mode from SDSS finding chart tools, without any

\gtrsim 10^{18} \,\mathrm{eV}$) photons with low energy cosmic background
radiation in the intergalactic space, giving birth to neutrinos. Although the
branching ratio of muon pair production is low, products of other channels,
which are mainly electron/positron pairs, will probably transfer most of their
energies into the new generated UHE photon in the subsequent interaction with
the cosmic background radiation via Compton scattering in deep Klein-Nishina
regime. The regeneration of these new UHE photons then provides a second chance
to produce the muon pairs, enhancing the neutrino flux. We investigate the
neutrino production in the propagation of UHE photons in the intergalactic
space at different redshifts, considering various competing processes such as
pair production, double pair production for UHE photons, and triplet production
and synchrotron radiation for UHE electrons. Regarding the least energetic
outgoing particles as energy loss, we obtain the effective penetration length
of the leading particle, as well as energy loss rate including the neutrino
emission rate in the cascade process. Finally, we find that an extra component
of UHE neutrinos will arise from the propagation of UHE cosmic rays due to the
generated UHE photons and electron/positrons. However, the flux of this
component is quite small, with a flux of at most $10\%$ of that of the
conventional cosmogenic neutrino at a few EeV, in the absence of a strong
intergalactic magnetic field and a strong cosmic radio background. The precise
contribution of extra component depends on several factors, e.g., cosmic radio
background, intergalactic magnetic field, the spectrum of proton, which will be

by the Herschel GCC Programme, here we study the filament properties presented
in GCC.VII in context with theoretical models of filament formation and
evolution. A conservative sample of filaments at a distance D<500pc was
extracted with the Getfilaments algorithm. Their physical structure was
quantified according to two main components: the central (Gaussian) region
(core component), and the power-law like region dominating the filament column
density profile at larger radii (wing component). The properties and behaviour
of these components relative to the total linear mass density of the filament
and its environmental column density were compared with theoretical models
describing the evolution of filaments under gravity-dominated conditions. The
feasibility of a transition to supercritical state by accretion is dependent on
the combined effect of filament intrinsic properties and environmental
conditions. Reasonably self-gravitating (high Mline-core) filaments in dense
environments (av\sim3mag) can become supercritical in timescales of t\sim1Myr
by accreting mass at constant or decreasing width. The trend of increasing
Mline-tot (Mline-core and Mline-wing), and ridge Av with background also
indicates that the precursors of star-forming filaments evolve coevally with
their environment. The simultaneous increase of environment and filament Av
explains the association between dense environments and high Mline-core values,
and argues against filaments remaining in constant single-pressure equilibrium
states. The simultaneous growth of filament and background in locations with
efficient mass assembly, predicted in numerical models of collapsing clouds,
presents a suitable scenario for the fulfillment of the combined filament
mass-environment criterium that is in quantitative agreement with Herschel

can detect bipartite higher dimensional entangled states. The efficacy of our
detection method lies in the fact that it gives better detection criteria than
most of the existing criteria based on geometry of the states. Interestingly,
we find that for $N$-qubit product states, the mutual uncertainty is exactly
equal to $N-\sqrt{N}$, and if it is other than this value, the state is
entangled. We also show that using the mutual uncertainty between two

effects, which may cause instability in a DC microgrid. Existing works often
study the stability around a given equilibrium based on some nominal values of
CPLs. However, in real applications, the equilibrium of a DC microgrid depends
on the loading condition that often changes over time. Different from many
previous results, this paper develops a framework that can analyze the DC
microgrid stability for a given range of CPLs. The problem is formulated as a
robust stability problem of a polytopic uncertain linear system. By exploiting
the structure of the problem, we derive a set of sufficient conditions that can
guarantee robust stability. The conditions can be efficiently checked by
solving a convex optimization problem whose complexity does not grow with the
number of buses in the microgrid. The effectiveness and non-conservativeness of

underlying exponential distance distribution extracted from the atomic traces.
Furthermore, we find that even small drifts influence the statistics of extreme

our theoretical functions and HERMES experimental data on $b_1$. Although
higher-twist effects should be considered in obtaining experimental $b_1$, it
suggests a possible existence of new hadron physics mechanism for spin-1
hadrons. Furthermore, we found that there are significant distributions at
large Bjorken $x$. In future, an experimental measurement is planned at JLab
for $b_1$ and there is a possibility of a proton-deuteron Drell-Yan experiment
at Fermilab with the tensor-polarized deuteron, so that further theoretical
studies are needed for clarifying the physics origin of tensor structure in
terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom.

of percent in the branching fraction in the $K^\ast$ signal region and
negligible in $F_L$. Since the backgrounds to $F_L$ are small this observable

a high-level navigation task. We set up a generic framework for training a
network to perform navigation tasks based on imitation learning. It can be
applied to both aerial and land vehicles. As a proof of concept we apply it to
a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in a simulated environment, learning to cross a
room containing a number of obstacles. So far only feedforward neural networks
(FNNs) have been used to train UAV control. To cope with more complex tasks, we
propose the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) instead and successfully
train an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) network for controlling UAVs. Vision
based control is a sequential prediction problem, known for its highly
correlated input data. The correlation makes training a network hard,
especially an RNN. To overcome this issue, we investigate an alternative
sampling method during training, namely window-wise truncated backpropagation
through time (WW-TBPTT). Further, end-to-end training requires a lot of data
which often is not available. Therefore, we compare the performance of
retraining only the Fully Connected (FC) and LSTM control layers with networks
which are trained end-to-end. Performing the relatively simple task of crossing
a room already reveals important guidelines and good practices for training
neural control networks. Different visualizations help to explain the behavior
learned.

each AP via the use of local channel state information (CSI). This CSI is
acquired through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink
training signals transmitted by the users. We derive a closed-form expression
for the spectral efficiency taking into account the effects of channel
estimation errors and power control. This closed-form result enables us to
analyze the effects of backhaul power consumption, the number of APs, and the
number of antennas per AP on the total energy efficiency, as well as, to design
an optimal power allocation algorithm. The optimal power allocation algorithm
aims at maximizing the total energy efficiency, subject to a per-user spectral
efficiency constraint and a per-AP power constraint. Compared with the equal
power control, our proposed power allocation scheme can double the total energy

increases significantly, especially for large numbers of APs. Moreover, under a

that the subgraphs $G_{\mathrm{el}}(e)$, $G_{\mathrm{si}}(e)$ of all elementary

which generates pure spin current. The built-in spin flip mechanism is a
consequence of the spin-vibration interaction resulting from the interplay
between the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the vibrational modes of the
suspended carbon nanotube. On the other hand, utilizing thermoelectric effect,
the temperature difference between the electron and the thermal bath to which
the vibrational modes are coupled provides the driving force. We find that both
magnitude and direction of the generated pure spin current are dependent on the
strength of spin-vibration interaction, the sublevel configuration in dot, the
temperatures of electron and thermal bath, and the tunneling rate between the
dot and the pole. Moreover, in the linear response regime, the kinetic
coefficient is non-monotonic in the temperature $T$ and it reaches its maximum
when $k_BT$ is about one phonon energy. The existence of a strong intradot
Coulomb interaction is irrelevant for our spin battery, provided that
high-order cotunneling processes are suppressed.

allowing them to collectively optimise large-scale data processing solutions in
a coherent manner. The execution in DALiuGE is data-activated, where each
individual data item autonomously triggers the processing on itself. Such
decentralisation also makes the execution framework very scalable and flexible,
supporting pipeline sizes ranging from less than ten tasks running on a laptop
to tens of millions of concurrent tasks on the second fastest supercomputer in
the world. DALiuGE has been used in production for reducing interferometry data
sets from the Karl E. Jansky Very Large Array and the Mingantu Ultrawide

  CO2 geological sequestration","Submitted to the Journal of Engineering Mathematics",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The convective stability associated with carbon sequestration is usually
investigated by adopting an unsteady diffusive basic profile. The method of
normal modes is not applicable due to the time dependence of the nonlinear base
profile. Therefore, the instability is quantified either in terms of critical
times at which the boundary layer instability sets in or in terms of long time
evolution of initial disturbances. This paper adopts an unstably stratified
basic profile having a step function density with top heavy carbon saturated
layer (boundary layer) overlying a lighter carbon free layer (ambient brine).
The resulting configuration resembles that of the Rayleigh-Taylor problem with
buoyancy diffusion at the interface separating the two layers. The
discontinuous reference state satisfies the governing system of equations and
boundary conditions and pertains to an unstably stratified motionless state.
Our model accounts for anisotropy in both diffusion and permeability and
chemical reaction between the carbon dioxide rich brine and host mineralogy. We
proceed by supposing that the carbon dioxide that has accumulated below the top
cap rock forms a layer of carbon saturated brine of some thickness that
overlies a carbon-free brine layer. The resulting stratification remains stable
until the thickness of the carbon saturated layer is sufficient to induce the
fluid to overturn. With this formulation for the reference state, the stability
calculations will be in terms of critical boundary layer thickness instead of
critical times, although the two formulations are homologous. This approach is
tractable by the classical normal mode analysis. Even though it yields only
conservative threshold instability conditions, it offers the advantage for an
analytically tractable linear and weakly nonlinear studies.

service providers have been pushing their content delivery infrastructure to
edge networks--from regional CDN servers to peer CDN servers (e.g.,
smartrouters in users' homes)--to cache content and serve users with storage
and network resources nearby. Among the edge network content caching paradigms,
Wi-Fi access point caching and cellular base station caching have become two
mainstream solutions. Thus, understanding the effectiveness and performance of
these solutions for large-scale mobile video delivery is important. However,
the characteristics and request patterns of mobile video streaming are unclear
in practical wireless network. In this paper, we use real-world datasets

0.3 million unique videos using mobile devices in a metropolis in China over 2
weeks, not only to understand the request patterns and user behaviors in mobile
video streaming, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of Wi-Fi and
cellular-based edge content caching solutions. To understand performance of
edge content caching for mobile video streaming, we first present temporal and
spatial video request patterns, and we analyze their impacts on caching
performance using frequency-domain and entropy analysis approaches. We then
study the behaviors of mobile video users, including their mobility and
geographical migration behaviors. Using trace-driven experiments, we compare
strategies for edge content caching including LRU and LFU, in terms of
supporting mobile video requests. Moreover, we design an efficient caching
strategy based on the measurement insights and experimentally evaluate its
performance.

no more valid in the presence of intra-class variabilities due to illumination
conditions, weathering, slight variations of the pure materials, etc... In this
paper, we first describe the results of investigations highlighting intra-class
variability measured in real images. Considering these results, a new
formulation of the linear mixing model is presented leading to two new methods.
Unconstrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (UP-NMF) is a new blind source separation
method based on the assumption of a linear mixing model, which can deal with
intra-class variability. To overcome UP-NMF limitations an extended method is
proposed, named Inertia-constrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (IP-NMF). For each
sensed spectrum, these extended versions of NMF extract a corresponding set of
source spectra. A constraint is set to limit the spreading of each source's
estimates in IP-NMF. The methods are tested on a semi-synthetic data set built
with spectra extracted from a real hyperspectral image and then numerically
mixed. We thus demonstrate the interest of our methods for realistic source
variabilities. Finally, IP-NMF is tested on a real data set and it is shown to
yield better performance than state of the art methods.

  A number of complex models (single and double peaked) of light curves from

for the registered photons was calculated by folding the arrival times with the
derived spin-period and the resulting distribution of phases approximated with
a mixed von Mises distribution, and its parameters were estimated by using the
Expected Maximization method. Spin phase-resolved spectra were extracted, and a

simultaneously, the results were verified via an MCMC approach. The
phase-folded light curves in different energy bands with high S/N ratio show a
high complexity and variations depending on time and energy.
  They can be parameterized with a mixed von Mises distribution, i.e. with

porous biomaterial scaffold and culture it within a perfusion bioreactor to
facilitate the transport of nutrients to growing cells. Typical models of cell
growth for tissue engineering applications make use of spatially homogeneous or
spatially continuous equations to model cell growth, flow of culture medium,
nutrient transport, and their interactions. The network structure of the
physical porous scaffold is often incorporated through parameters in these
models, either phenomenologically or through techniques like mathematical
homogenization. We derive a model on a square grid lattice to demonstrate the
importance of explicitly modelling the network structure of the porous
scaffold, and compare results from this model with those from a modified
continuum model from the literature. We capture two-way coupling between cell
growth and fluid flow by allowing cells to block pores, and by allowing the
shear stress of the fluid to affect cell growth and death. We explore a range
of parameters for both models, and demonstrate quantitative and qualitative
differences between predictions from each of these approaches, including
spatial pattern formation and local oscillations in cell density present only
in the lattice model. These differences suggest that for some parameter
regimes, corresponding to specific cell types and scaffold geometries, the
lattice model gives qualitatively different model predictions than typical
continuum models. Our results inform model selection for bioactive porous
tissue scaffolds, aiding in the development of successful tissue engineering
experiments and eventually clinically successful technologies.

develop from an interplay of multiple economic exchanges in the presence of

self-consistently constrained by dynamical conservation laws emerging from
population and wealth conservation. This model is numerically solved and
analyzed to interpret the inequality of income as a function of relevant
dynamical parameters like the {\it mobility} $M$ and the {\it total income}
$\mu$. In our model, inequality is quantified by the {\it Gini index} $G$. In
particular, correlations between any two of the mobility index $M$ and/or the
total income $\mu$ with the Gini index $G$ are investigated and compared with
the analogous correlations resulting from an equivalent additive noise model.
Our findings highlight the importance of a multiplicative noise based economic

the Riemann-complete or gauge integral which, independently, Jaroslav Kurzweil
also discovered in the 1950's. As a Cambridge undergraduate Henstock took a
course of lectures, by J.C. Burkill, on the integration of interval functions.
Later, under the supervision of Paul Dienes in Birkbeck College, London, he
undertook research into the ideas of Burkill (interval function integrands) and
Dienes (Stieltjes integrands); and he presented this thesis in December 1948.
  The thesis contains the germ of Henstock's later work, in terms of overall
approach and methods of proof. For example, a notable innovation is a set of
axioms for constructing any particular system of integration. This highlights
the features held in common by various systems, so that a particular property
or theorem can, by a single, common proof, be shown to hold for various kinds
of integration.
  Within this approach, Henstock's thesis places particular emphasis on various
alternative ways of selecting Riemann sums, as the primary distinguishing
feature of different systems of integration. This idea was central to his
subsequent work and achievement.
  Of interest also are those ideas in the thesis which were effectively
abandoned in his subsequent work.
  In addition to Henstock's own insights at that stage of his work, this thesis
provides a good overview of the literature and state of knowledge of
integration of the non-Lebesgue kind at that time.
  These are good enough reasons for transcribing the thesis. Another pressing
reason is that the ink and paper of the near 70 years old copy of the thesis in
the Archive in the University of Ulster Library in Coleraine (Henstock's
personal, annotated copy) are showing signs of deterioration.

angle-dependent, which can be expressed as a combination of Raman responses
under zigzag and armchair strains. Different from previous polarized optical
spectroscopic means, the proposed method does not rely on the laser
polarization, the excitation wavelength, the sample thickness and the material
of the stretchable substrate. Besides, the effective strain applied on BP from
the stretched substrate is estimated, showing that only 20% to 40% of the
strain can be effectively transferred to BP flakes from polyethylene
terephthalate substrates. Our method provides not only an effective and
universal approach to identify the crystalline orientation of layered BP, but
also a model to extract additional information in strain-related studies, and
can be extended to other 2D anisotropic materials.

can be proved that measure-theoretic probability is a theory free from

only in the theory rather than in the physical world, and will not affect
practical applications as long as ideal events in the theory (which will not
occur physically) are not mistaken for observable events in the real world.
Nevertheless, unlike known paradoxes in mathematics, the inconsistency cannot
be explained away and hence must be resolved. The assumption of infinite
additivity in the theory is relevant to the inconsistency, and may cause
confusion of ideal events and real events. As illustrated by an example in this
article, since abstract properties of mathematical entities in theoretical
thinking are not necessarily properties of physical quantities observed in the
real world, mistaking the former for the latter may lead to misinterpreting
random phenomena observed in experiments with microscopic systems. Actually the

Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is formulated. The modified finite element
method is utilized to model transient heat and fluid flow within an EGS
reservoir. Three main features are modified to determine their impact on the
reservoir: the fracture model, the porous model, and the coupling physical
model. For the first feature, the fractures are modeled as a two-dimensional
subdomain embedded in a vast three-dimensional rock mass. The fracture model
eliminates the need to create slender fractures with a high aspect ratio by
allowing reduction of the spatial discretization of the fractures from three-
to two-dimensional finite elements. In this model, pseudo three-dimensional
equations are adopted to drive the physics of heat and fluid flow in the
fractures. In the second feature, a porous subdomain with effective transport
properties is modeled to integrate a thermally-shocked region in the reservoir
simulation. In the third feature, three-dimensional heat flow in the rock mass
is coupled to the two-dimensional heat and fluid flow in the fractures.
Numerical examples are computed to illustrate the computational capability of
the proposed model to simulate heat and fluid flow in an EGS. Results show that
the proposed model is capable of both effectively integrating thermal fractures
into reservoir simulation, as well as efficiently tackling the computational
burden exerted by high aspect ratio geometries. A parametric analysis is also
performed in which the effect of thermal fractures and thermally-shocked region
on reservoir performance is evaluated.

Unicode, ont resolu beaucoup de difficultes de lecriture arabe, le volet
linguistique est encore en quete de solutions plus adaptees. La terminologie
est lun des secteurs dans lequel la langue arabe necessite une modernisation
profonde de ses modeles classiques de production. La voie normative, notamment
celle du TC37 de ISO, est proposee comme une des solutions qui lui permettrait
de se mettre en synergie avec les referentiels internationaux pour mieux
integrer la societe du savoir en voie de construction.

  Applications Running on Embedded Systems",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a novel method for automatically tuning the selection
of compiler flags to optimize the performance of software intended to run on
embedded hardware platforms. We begin by developing our approach on code
compiled by the GNU C Compiler (GCC) for the ARM Cortex-M3 (CM3) processor; and
we show how our method outperforms the industry standard -O3 optimization level
across a diverse embedded benchmark suite. First we quantify the potential
gains by using existing iterative compilation approaches that time-intensively
search for optimal configurations for each benchmark. Then we adapt iterative
compilation to output a single configuration that optimizes performance across
the entire benchmark suite. Although this is a time-consuming process, our
approach constructs an optimized variation of -O3, which we call -Ocm3, that
realizes nearly two thirds of known available gains on the CM3 and
significantly outperforms a more complex state-of-the-art predictive method in
cross-validation experiments. Finally, we demonstrate our method on additional
platforms by constructing two more optimization levels that find even more
significant speed-ups on the ARM Cortex-A8 and 8-bit AVR processors.
