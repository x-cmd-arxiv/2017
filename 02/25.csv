of disk galaxies to elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we determine if the
observed transformation in low mass groups can be explained by the merger
histories of galaxies. We measured the group mass-morphology relation for
groups from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly group catalogue with masses from
10$^{11}$ - 10$^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$. Contrary to previous studies, the fraction
of elliptical galaxies in our more complete group sample increases
significantly with group mass across the full range of group mass. The
elliptical fraction increases at a rate of 0.163$\pm$0.012 per dex of group
mass for groups more massive than 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. If we allow for
uncertainties in the observed group masses, our results are consistent with a
continuous increase in elliptical fraction from group masses as low as
10$^{11}$M$_{\odot}$. We tested if this observed relation is consistent with
merger activity using a GADGET-2 dark matter simulation of the galaxy groups.
We specified that a simulated galaxy would be transformed to an elliptical
morphology either if it experienced a major merger or if its cumulative mass
gained from minor mergers exceeded 30 per cent of its final mass. We then
calculated a group mass-morphology relation for the simulations. The position
and slope of the simulated relation were consistent with the observational
relation, with a gradient of 0.184$\pm$0.010 per dex of group mass. These
results demonstrate a strong correlation between the frequency of merger events
and disk-to-elliptical galaxy transformation in galaxy group environments.

  A Study Design and Preliminary Results",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Seamless model-based development provides integrated chains of
models, covering all software engineering phases. Non-functional requirements
(NFRs), like reusability, further play a vital role in software and systems
engineering, but are often neglected in research and practice. It is still
unclear how to integrate NFRs in a seamless model-based development. Goal: Our
long-term goal is to develop a theory on the specification of NFRs such that
they can be integrated in seamless model-based development. Method: Our overall
study design includes a multi-staged procedure to infer an empirically founded
theory on specifying NFRs to support seamless modeling. In this short paper, we
present the study design and provide a discussion of (i) preliminary results
obtained from a sample, and (ii) current issues related to the design. Results:
Our study already shows significant fields of improvement, e.g., the low
agreement during the classification. However, the results indicate to
interesting points; for example, many of commonly used NFR classes concern
system modeling concepts in a way that shows how blurry the borders between
functional and NFRs are. Conclusions: We conclude so far that our overall study
design seems suitable to obtain the envisioned theory in the long run, but we
could also show current issues that are worth discussing within the empirical
software engineering community. The main goal of this contribution is not to
present and discuss current results only, but to foster discussions on the
issues related to the integration of NFRs in seamless modeling in general and,
in particular, discussions on open methodological issues.

modeling GRNs using the partially-observed Boolean dynamical system (POBDS)
signal model with noisy gene expression measurements. Obtaining the optimal
infinite-horizon control strategy for this problem is not attainable in
general, and we apply reinforcement learning and Gaussian process techniques to
find a near-optimal solution. The POBDS is first transformed to a
directly-observed Markov Decision Process in a continuous belief space, and the
Gaussian process is used for modeling the cost function over the belief and
intervention spaces. Reinforcement learning then is used to learn the cost
function from the available gene expression data. In addition, we employ
sparsification, which enables the control of large partially-observed GRNs. The
performance of the resulting algorithm is studied through a comprehensive set

relying on survey research and explored the impact of quality defects in SRS by
relying on a controlled experiment. Results: Our results suggest that the
relevance of SRS quality depends both on particular project characteristics and
what is considered as a quality defect; for instance, the domain of safety
critical systems seems to motivate for an intense usage of SRS as a means for
communication whereas defects hampering the pragmatic quality do not seem to be
as relevant as initially thought. Conclusion: Efficient and effective quality

radius of the sphere containing the antennas at both ends of the link, and we
show that, in general, the capacity can only be achieved by transmitting
multiple spatially-multiplexed data streams simultaneously over the channel.
Furthermore, the lower bound on capacity can be approached asymptotically by
transmitting the data streams between a pair of physically-realizable
distributed antenna arrays at either end of the link. A consequence of this
result is that, in general, communication at close to the maximum achievable
data rate on a deep-space communication link can be achieved in practice if and

distributed MIMO antenna array. Such an approach to deep-space communication
does not appear to be envisioned currently by any of the international space

diagnose high density plasma regimes generated by the interaction of X-ray free

demonstrates the potential role of this rate for a better understanding of the

production of a field whose mass is controlled by the inflaton field and
vanishes at one given instance during inflation. This generates a bump in the
correlators of the primordial scalar curvature. We provide a unified formalism
to compute various effects that have been obtained in the literature and
confirm that the dominant effects are due to the rescattering of the produced
particles on the inflaton condensate. We improve over existing results (based
on numerical fits) by providing exact analytic expressions for the shape and
height of the bump, both in the power spectrum and the equilateral bispectrum.
We then study the regime of validity of the perturbative computations of this
signature. Finally, we extend these computations to the case of a burst of
particle production in a sector coupled only gravitationally to the inflaton.

deep convolutional networks regarding invariance, depth and hierarchy. We
introduce the paradigm of Transformation Networks (TN) which are a direct
generalization of Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). Theoretically, we show
that TNs (and thereby ConvNets) are can be invariant to non-linear
transformations of the input despite pooling over mere local translations. Our
analysis provides clear insights into the increase in invariance with depth in
these networks. Deeper networks are able to model much richer classes of

a weighted undirected graph, and $k$ mobile heterogeneous agents, each being
able to transport one message at a time. Following a recent model by
[B\""artschi et al. 2016], each agent $i$ consumes energy proportional to the
distance it travels in the graph, where the different rates of energy
consumption are given by weight factors $w_i$. We are interested in optimizing
or approximating the total energy consumption over all selected agents.
  Unlike previous research, we assume the weights to be private values known
only to the respective agents. We present three different mechanisms which
select, route and pay the agents in a truthful way that guarantees voluntary
participation of the agents, while approximating the optimum energy consumption
by a constant factor. To this end we analyze a previous structural result and
an approximation algorithm given by [B\""artschi et al. 2017]. Finally, we show
that for some instances in the case of a single package, the sum of the

been done with synthetic solutions. Such studies rarely mimic the field
situation. Therefore, selection of an adsorbent that can remove F$^-$ from any
kind of feed requires models that can predict the adsorption behavior for any
given set of input conditions. From our observations and as also reported by
many authors, the adsorption of F$^-$ is affected by the presence of many ions.
When modelling the adsorption of F$^-$, it is usually taken as a single entity
getting adsorbed on the adsorbent. As this is not a proper assumption, a model
was developed which takes into account all the speciation reactions that take
place during adsorption, and all the species like H$^+$, OH$^-$, Na$^+$,
Cl$^-$, and NO$_3^-$ present in the solution along with F$^-$. As an
electrolyte system is involved, the Nernst-Planck equations were used to obtain
the flux of each species. Using the model, the equilibrium constants and rate
constants for the reactions were obtained. For one initial concentration of
F$^-$, a reasonable fit was obtained to the batch adsorption data, except at
short times. Because of an uncertainty in the amount of impurity present in the
commercial adsorbent used, there was a significant discrepancy between
predictions and data at higher initial concentrations of F$^-$. The present
model can be applied to any charged adsorbent.

apparent hardness of improving upon the naive solutions for many fundamental
polynomially solvable problems. This progress has come in the form of
conditional lower bounds -- reductions from a problem assumed to be hard. The
hard problems include 3SUM, All-Pairs Shortest Path, SAT, Orthogonal Vectors,
and others.
  In the $(\min,+)$-convolution problem, the goal is to compute a sequence
$(c[i])^{n-1}_{i=0}$, where $c[k] = $ $\min_{i=0,\ldots,k} $ $\{a[i] $ $+$
$b[k-i]\}$, given sequences $(a[i])^{n-1}_{i=0}$ and $(b[i])_{i=0}^{n-1}$. This
can easily be done in $O(n^2)$ time, but no $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ algorithm is
known for $\varepsilon > 0$. In this paper, we undertake a systematic study of
the $(\min,+)$-convolution problem as a hardness assumption.
  First, we establish the equivalence of this problem to a group of other
problems, including variants of the classic knapsack problem and problems
related to subadditive sequences. The $(\min,+)$-convolution problem has been
used as a building block in algorithms for many problems, notably problems in
stringology. It has also appeared as an ad hoc hardness assumption. Second, we
investigate some of these connections and provide new reductions and other
results. We also explain why replacing this assumption with the SETH might not
be possible for some problems.

automatic classification methods to select and analyze sources. Indeed, this is
the case for the search for strong gravitational lenses, where the population
of the detectable lensed sources is only a very small fraction of the full
source population. We apply for the first time a morphological classification
method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing strong
gravitational lenses in $255$ square degrees of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS),
one of the current-generation optical wide surveys. The CNN is currently
optimized to recognize lenses with Einstein radii $\gtrsim 1.4$ arcsec, about
twice the $r$-band seeing in KiDS. In a sample of $21789$ colour-magnitude
selected Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG), of which three are known lenses, the CNN
retrieves 761 strong-lens candidates and correctly classifies two out of three
of the known lenses. The misclassified lens has an Einstein radius below the
range on which the algorithm is trained. We down-select the most reliable 56
candidates by a joint visual inspection. This final sample is presented and
discussed. A conservative estimate based on our results shows that with our
proposed method it should be possible to find $\sim100$ massive LRG-galaxy
lenses at $z\lsim 0.4$ in KiDS when completed. In the most optimistic scenario
this number can grow considerably (to maximally $\sim$2400 lenses), when
widening the colour-magnitude selection and training the CNN to recognize
smaller image-separation lens systems.

SN 2014J detected in January 21 2014, the closest Type Ia supernova since
Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes started to operate. We probe the possibility
of very-high-energy (VHE; $E\geq100$ GeV) gamma rays produced in the early
stages of Type Ia supernova explosions. We performed follow-up observations
after this supernova explosion for 5 days, between January 27 and February 2 in
2014. We search for gamma-ray signal in the energy range between 100 GeV and
several TeV from the location of SN 2014J using data from a total of $\sim5.5$
hours of observations. Prospects for observing gamma-rays of hadronic origin
from SN 2014J in the near future are also being addressed. No significant
excess was detected from the direction of SN 2014J. Upper limits at 95$\%$
confidence level on the integral flux, assuming a power-law spectrum,
d$F/$d$E\propto E^{-\Gamma}$, with a spectral index of $\Gamma=2.6$, for
energies higher than 300 GeV and 700 GeV, are established at
$1.3\times10^{-12}$ and $4.1\times10^{-13}$ photons~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$,
respectively. For the first time, upper limits on the VHE emission of a Type Ia
supernova are established. The energy fraction isotropically emitted into TeV
gamma rays during the first $\sim10$ days after the supernova explosion for
energies greater than 300 GeV is limited to $10^{-6}$ of the total available
energy budget ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg). Within the assumed theoretical scenario,
the MAGIC upper limits on the VHE emission suggest that SN 2014J will not be
detectable in the future by any current or planned generation of Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.

impact on the interpretation of $V\!\sin i$ and on the observed distribution
$\Phi(u)$ of ratios of true rotational velocities $u=V/V_\rm c$ ($V_\rm c$ is
the equatorial critical velocity). We discuss some phenomena affecting the
formation of spectral lines and their broadening, which can obliterate the
information carried by $V\!\sin i$ concerning the actual stellar rotation. We
studied the line broadening produced by several differential rotational laws,
but adopted Maunder's expression
$\Omega(\theta)=\Omega_o(1+\alpha\cos^2\theta)$ as an attempt to account for
all of these laws with the lowest possible number of free parameters. We
studied the effect of the differential rotation parameter $\alpha$ on the
measured $V\!\sin i$ parameter and on the distribution $\Phi(u)$ of ratios
$u=V/V_\rm c$. We conclude that the inferred $V\!\sin i$ is smaller than
implied by the actual equatorial linear rotation velocity $V_\rm eq$ if the
stars rotate with $\alpha<0$, but is larger if the stars have $\alpha>0$. For a
given $|\alpha|$ the deviations of $V\!\sin i$ are larger when $\alpha<0$. If
the studied Be stars have on average $\alpha<0$, the number of rotators with
$V_\rm eq\simeq0.9V_\rm c$ is larger than expected from the observed
distribution $\Phi(u)$; if these stars have on average $\alpha>0$, this number
is lower than expected. We discuss seven phenomena that contribute either to
narrow or broaden spectral lines, which blur the information on the rotation
carried by $V\!\sin i$ and, in particular, to decide whether the Be phenomenon
mostly rely on the critical rotation. We show that two-dimensional radiation
transfer calculations are needed in rapid rotators to diagnose the stellar

to aid in the interpretation and discovery of possible mechanistic components
and therapeutic targets. However, genomic-scale networks are high-dimensional
models and are usually estimated from a relatively small number of samples.
Therefore, their usefulness is hampered by estimation instability. In addition,
the complexity of the models is controlled by one or more penalization (tuning)
parameters where small changes to these can lead to vastly different networks,
thus making interpretation of models difficult. This necessitates the
development of techniques to produce robust network models accompanied by
estimation quality assessments.
  We introduce Resampling of Penalized Estimates (ROPE): a novel statistical
method for robust network modeling. The method utilizes resampling-based
network estimation and integrates results from several levels of penalization
through a constrained, over-dispersed beta-binomial mixture model. ROPE
provides robust False Discovery Rate (FDR) control of network estimates and
each edge is assigned a measure of validity, the q-value, corresponding to the
FDR-level for which the edge would be included in the network model. We apply
ROPE to several simulated data sets as well as genomic data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas. We show that ROPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of FDR control and robust performance across data sets. We illustrate how to
use ROPE to make a principled model selection for which genomic associations to
study further. ROPE is available as an R package on CRAN.

four electronic states regardless of the field direction, namely, a non-Fermi
liquid (NFL) state, an antiferro-quadrupolar (AFQ) ordered state, a novel
heavy-fermion (HF) state, and a field-induced singlet (FIS) state. In the wide
range of the NFL state, the resistivity can be well scaled by a characteristic
temperature, suggesting the realization of the quadrupole Kondo effect. The HF
state exhibits a Fermi liquid behavior with a large A coefficient of the T^2
term in the resistivity, suggesting the formation of nontrivial heavy
quasi-particles. The FIS state results from the considerable splitting of a
non-Kramers doublet by a magnetic field. The phase diagram shows a large
anisotropy with respect to the field direction. It is found that the anisotropy
of the phase diagram can be explained in terms of that of the energy splitting
of the non-Kramers doublet by a magnetic field. This indicates that the low
temperature properties of PrRh2Zn20 are governed by the non-Kramers doublet,
namely, quadrupole degrees of freedom. Since a similar phase diagram has been
obtained for the related compound PrIr2Zn20, it is expected that the B-T phase
diagram constructed in this work is universal throughout non-Kramers systems.

These queries have been shown to be a robust and efficient way to learn an

preferences through a linear classifier, using a Bayesian prior to encode our
current knowledge of this classifier. The rate at which we learn depends on the
alternatives offered at every time epoch. Under certain noise assumptions, we
show that the Bayes-optimal policy for maximally reducing entropy of the
posterior distribution of this linear classifier is a greedy policy, and that
this policy achieves a linear lower bound when alternatives can be constructed
from the continuum. Further, we analyze a different metric called
misclassification error, proving that the performance of the optimal policy

a new method for this task, based on the fractal structure of a quadtree, which
allows dynamic segmentation of the chip area, along with dynamically adjusting
the necessary communication infrastructure. We describe a number of algorithmic
aspects, and present different solutions. We also provide a number of basic
simulations that indicate that the theoretical worst-case bound may be
pessimistic.

crosscorrelation properties of pairs of sequences associated to
Rudin-Shapiro-like polynomials. We find an explicit formula for the
crosscorrelation merit factor. A computer search is then used to find pairs of
Rudin-Shapiro-like polynomials whose autocorrelation and crosscorrelation merit

how good this combined autocorrelation and crosscorrelation performance can be.
We find infinite families of polynomials whose performance approaches quite

in gold-gold collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV/nucleon-pair.
These pion pairs are produced when a nearly-real photon emitted by one ion
scatters from the other ion.
  We fit the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass spectrum with a combination of $\rho$
and $\omega$ resonances and a direct $\pi^+\pi^-$ continuum. This is the first
observation of the $\omega$ in ultra-peripheral collisions, and the first
measurement of $\rho-\omega$ interference at energies where photoproduction is
dominated by Pomeron exchange. The $\omega$ amplitude is consistent with the
measured $\gamma p\rightarrow \omega p$ cross section, a classical Glauber
calculation and the $\omega\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-$ branching ratio. The $\omega$
phase angle is similar to that observed at much lower energies, showing that
the $\rho-\omega$ phase difference does not depend significantly on photon
energy.
  The $\rho^0$ differential cross section $d\sigma/dt$ exhibits a clear
diffraction pattern, compatible with scattering from a gold nucleus, with 2
minima visible. The positions of the diffractive minima agree better with the
predictions of a quantum Glauber calculation that does not include nuclear
shadowing than with a calculation that does include shadowing.

encrypted tunnel (e.g. Tor, VPN). Numerous defenses have been proposed in the
past; however, it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their
security, which is most often evaluated empirically against state-of-the-art
attacks. In this paper, we present a practical method to derive security bounds
for any WF defense, which depend on a chosen feature set. This result derives
from reducing WF attacks to an ML classification task, where we can determine
the smallest achievable error (the Bayes error); such error can be estimated in
practice, and is a lower bound for a WF adversary, for any classification
algorithm he may use. Our work has two main consequences: i) it allows
determining the security of WF defenses, in a black-box manner, with respect to
the state-of-the-art feature set and ii) it favors shifting the focus of future
WF research to the identification of optimal feature sets. The generality of
the approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security

discovered by the Kepler Mission, this paper considers perturbations due to
possible additional outer planets. The discovered compact systems sometimes
contain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum
vectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced
oscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these
systems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If
planets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large
mass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner
orbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper
considers the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more
planets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually
transiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have
periastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18
planetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other
orbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion
properties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting
disk prior). A separate ensemble of numerical experiments shows that these
compact systems generally cannot contain Jupiter-analogs without disrupting the
observed orbits. We also consider how these constraints depend on system
properties and find that the surface density of the planetary system is one of
the most important variables. Finally, we provide specific results for two
systems, WASP-47 and Kepler-20, for which this analysis provides interesting
constraints.

for all objects. Candidate variables are identified as objects having high

two distinguishing features of VaST are its ability to perform accurate
aperture photometry of images obtained with non-linear detectors and handle
complex image distortions. The software has been successfully applied to images
obtained with telescopes ranging from 0.08 to 2.5m in diameter equipped with a

in order to reach better decisions than they could on their own. One of the
premises of productive discussions is that better solutions will prevail, and
that the idea selection process is mediated by the (relative) competence of the

competence on a new task, their behavior is influenced by their self-estimated
competence --- that is, their confidence --- which can be misaligned with their
actual competence.
  Our goal in this work is to understand the effects of confidence-competence
misalignment on the dynamics and outcomes of discussions. To this end, we
design a large-scale natural setting, in the form of an online team-based
geography game, that allows us to disentangle confidence from competence and
thus separate their effects.
  We find that in task-oriented discussions, the more-confident individuals
have a larger impact on the group's decisions even when these individuals are
at the same level of competence as their teammates. Furthermore, this
unjustified role of confidence in the decision-making process often leads teams
to under-perform. We explore this phenomenon by investigating the effects of
confidence on conversational dynamics.

Lorentz invariant effective theory of massless spin 2, namely general
relativity, other theories that utilize higher derivative interactions do in
fact exist. These theories are distinct from general relativity, as they permit
any number of species of spin 2 particles, are described by a much larger set
of parameters, and are not constrained to satisfy the equivalence principle. We
consider the leading spin 2 couplings to scalars, fermions, and vectors, and
systematically study signal propagation in all these other families of
theories. We find that most interactions directly lead to superluminal
propagation of either a spin 2 particle or a matter particle, and interactions
that are subluminal generate other interactions that are superluminal. Hence,
such theories of interacting multiple spin 2 species have superluminality, and
by extension, acausality. This is radically different to the special case of
general relativity with a single species of minimally coupled spin 2, which
leads to subluminal propagation from sources satisfying the null energy
condition. This pathology persists even if the spin 2 field is massive. We
compare these findings to the analogous case of spin 1 theories, where higher
derivative interactions can be causal. This makes the spin 2 case very special,
and suggests that multiple species of spin 2 is forbidden, leading us to
general relativity as essentially the unique internally consistent effective
theory of spin 2.

their many-body treatment has only been done classically, with just binary
scattering solved in quantum mechanics. In this paper we start quantum
many-body studies of the monopole ensembles. Specifically, we carry out
numerical simulations of the path integral for one- and two-component Coulomb
Bose systems. We determine the relation between the critical temperature for
the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition $T_\text{c}$ and the Coulomb
coupling strength using two methods, the classic finite-size scaling of the
condensate and a lattice-tested method based on permutation cycles. For a
one-component Coulomb Bose gas, we observe the same behavior of the critical
temperature -- initially rising slightly then falling as interaction strength
is increased -- as seen in the case of hard spheres; we also observe the same
behavior for a two-component Coulomb Bose gas. We then calculate sets of radial
correlation functions between the like and unlike charged particles. By
matching those with the correlation functions previously calculated on the
lattice, we derive an effective quantum model of color magnetic monopoles in
QCD. From this matched model, we are able to extract the monopole contribution
to QCD equation of state near $T_\text{c}$.

propose to go one step further and directly detect intergalactic medium
filaments through their emission in the HI 21cm line. We make use of high
resolution cosmological simulations to estimate the intensity of this emission
in low redshift filaments and use it to make predictions for the direct
detectability of specific filaments previously inferred from galaxy surveys, in
particular the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Given the expected signal of these
filaments our study shows that HI emission from large filaments can be observed

filaments of length $l \gtrsim$ 15 $h^{-1}$Mpc with relatively small
inclinations to the line of sight ($\lesssim 10^\circ$) can be observed in
$\sim40-100$ hours with telescopes such as GMRT or EVLA, potentially providing
large improvements over our knowledge of the astrophysical properties of these
filaments. Due to their large field of view and sufficiently long integration
times, upcoming HI surveys with the Apertif and ASKAP instruments will be able
to detect large filaments independently of their orientation and curvature.
Furthermore, our estimates indicate that a more powerful future radio telescope

enhanced turbulence, as is common for clouds in high-density nuclear
environments. Like the young massive clusters, we find a maximum-mass scale for

cluster mass being $10^{-2}$ times that of the most massive molecular cloud.
Outside the nuclear region of M83 ($R_{g}>0.5$ kpc), there is no evidence for
changing internal conditions in the population of molecular clouds, with the
average internal pressures, densities, and free-fall times remaining constant

considers the density to be arranged into a collection of strong shocks of
width $\sim\! \mathcal{M}^{-2}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the turbulent Mach
number. With two physically motivated parameters, the model predicts all
density statistics for $\mathcal{M}>1$ turbulence: the density probability
distribution and its intermittency (deviation from log-normality), the density
variance-Mach number relation, power spectra, and structure functions. For the
proposed model parameters, reasonable agreement is seen between model
predictions and numerical simulations, albeit within the large uncertainties
associated with current simulation results. More generally, the model could
provide a useful framework for more detailed analysis of future simulations and

studied the plane-of-sky B field for one IRDC, G028.23-00.19, to understand the
interaction between the field and the cloud. We used near-IR background
starlight polarimetry to probe the B field and performed several observational
tests to assess the field importance. The polarimetric data, taken with the
Mimir instrument, consisted of H-band and K-band observations, totaling 17,160
stellar measurements. We traced the plane-of-sky B-field morphology with
respect to the sky-projected cloud elongation. We also found the relationship
between the estimated B-field strength and gas volume density, and we computed
estimates of the normalized mass-to-magnetic flux ratio. The B-field
orientation with respect to the cloud did not show a preferred alignment, but
it did exhibit a large-scale pattern. The plane-of-sky B-field strengths ranged
from 10 to 165 {\mu}G, and the B-field strength dependence on density followed
a power law with an index consistent with 2/3. The mass-to-magnetic flux ratio
also increased as a function of density. The relative orientations and
relationship between the B field and density imply that the B field was not
dynamically important in the formation of the IRDC. The increase in
mass-to-flux ratio as a function of density, though, indicates a dynamically
important B field. Therefore, it is unclear whether the B field influenced the
formation of G28.23. However, it is likely that the presence of the IRDC
changed the local B-field morphology.

fixed-length fiber-optic cable in continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD) is currently limited by the computational complexity of
post-processing algorithms for key reconciliation. Multi-edge low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes with low code rates and long block lengths were
proposed for CV-QKD, in order to extend the maximum reconciliation distance
between the two remote parties. Key reconciliation over multiple dimensions has
been shown to further improve the error-correction performance of multi-edge
LDPC codes in CV-QKD, thereby increasing both the secret key rate and distance.
However, the computational complexity of LDPC decoding for long block lengths
on the order of 10^6 bits remains a challenge. This work introduces a
quasi-cyclic (QC) code construction for multi-edge LDPC codes that is highly
suitable for hardware-accelerated decoding on a modern graphics processing unit
(GPU). When combined with an 8-dimensional reconciliation scheme, the LDPC
decoder achieves a raw decoding throughput of 1.72Mbit/s and an information
throughput of 7.16Kbit/s using an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU at a maximum
distance of 160km with a secret key rate of 4.10x10^{-7} bits/pulse for a rate
0.02 multi-edge code with block length of 10^6 bits when finite-size effects
are considered. This work extends the previous maximum CV-QKD distance of 100km
to 160km, while delivering between 1.07x and 8.03x higher decoded information
throughput over the upper bound on the secret key rate for a lossy channel. The
GPU-based QC-LDPC decoder achieves a 1.29x improvement in throughput over the
best existing GPU decoder implementation for a rate 1/10 multi-edge LDPC code
with block length of 2^{20} bits. These results show that LDPC decoding is no

expanding branch emerges from a past singularity, reaches a maximum, reverses
its expansion and possibly collapses into itself while another expanding branch
emerges from the latter singularity and has a stable de Sitter phase which is
intrinsically stable. We obtain a different piecewise scale factor which
describes a contracting de Sitter universe in the distant past until the

contracting phase, bounces at the minimum, reverses, and enters into a stable
de Sitter phase without a dramatic final. Also, we explore the aforesaid cosmic

argument, applicable to any particular theory of quantum gravity with matter,
by performing the analysis in the abstract nonperturbative canonical framework,
demonstrating the nonseparability of the scalar constraint, thus promoting the
entangled states as the physical ones. Also, within the covariant framework, we
show explicitly that the Hartle-Hawking state in the Regge model of quantum
gravity is necessarily entangled. Our result is potentially relevant for the
quantum-to-classical transition, taken within the framework of the decoherence
programme: due to the gauge symmetry requirements, the matter does not
decohere, it is by default decohered by gravity. Generically, entanglement is a
consequence of interaction. This new entanglement could potentially, in form of
an ""effective interaction"", bring about corrections to the weak equivalence
principle, further confirming that spacetime as a smooth four-dimensional
manifold is an emergent phenomenon. Finally, the existence of the
gauge-protected entanglement between gravity and matter could be seen as a
criterion for a plausible theory of quantum gravity, and in the case of
perturbative quantisation approaches, a confirmation of the persistence of the
manifestly broken gauge symmetry.

In particular we show that sample thickness and biaxial strain can serve as
control parameters to design the electronic properties of DB defects. While in
thick Si samples the neutral DB state is resonant with bulk valence bands,
ultrathin samples (1-2 nm) lead to an isolated impurity state in the gap;
similar behavior is seen for DB pairs and DB wires. Strain further isolates the
DB from the valence band, with the response to strain heavily dependent on
sample thickness. These findings suggest new methods for tuning the properties
of defects on surfaces for electronic and quantum information applications.
Finally, we present a consistent and unifying interpretation of many results
presented in the literature for DB defects on hydrogenated silicon surfaces,
rationalizing apparent discrepancies between different experiments and

excludes masses in the range (5-3000) MeV while DAMIC only probes (20-50) MeV.

important choice is the aggregation granularity that an analyst uses to bin the
data. Picking such a windowing of the data is often done by hand, or left up to
the technology that is collecting the data. However, the choice can make a big
difference in the properties of the dynamic network. This is the time scale
detection problem. In previous work, this problem is often solved with a
heuristic as an unsupervised task. As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult
to measure how well a given algorithm performs. In addition, we show that the
quality of the windowing is dependent on which task an analyst wants to perform
on the network after windowing. Therefore the time scale detection problem
should not be handled independently from the rest of the analysis of the
network.
  We introduce a framework that tackles both of these issues: By measuring the
performance of the time scale detection algorithm based on how well a given
task is accomplished on the resulting network, we are for the first time able
to directly compare different time scale detection algorithms to each other.
Using this framework, we introduce time scale detection algorithms that take a
supervised approach: they leverage ground truth on training data to find a good
windowing of the test data. We compare the supervised approach to previous
approaches and several baselines on real data.

dispersion under breaking waves. By assuming that the multiple phases are
immiscible, the two-phase model solves the same set of governing equations for
both phases. Density in each phase is preserved by renormalization, and the
harmonic mean of viscosities is used in the transition zone. Interfacial
surface tension effect between the oil and the water is considered by a
numerical surface tension model. The model is first used to simulate a single
oil drop rising through still water. The numerical model predicts realistic
shape change of the oil drop during the rising process caused by the buoyancy
force. Next it is applied to reproduce a laboratory experiment on oil
dispersion under breaking waves conducted at Johns Hopkins University. Several
high-speed cameras were used to record the interaction between breaking waves
and the oil. Comparison with the laboratory measurements shows that GPUSPH is
able to reproduce well the pre- & post-breaking wave in the laboratory,
however, oil dispersion predicted by GPUSPH only match part of the laboratory
observation. Several factors (e.g., 3D & chaotic nature of breaking waves,

a multi-lane highway in California, USA. We calculate the correlation
coefficients for spacings between vehicles in individual lanes to show that the
flows are independent. We determine the first four moments for individual lanes
at regular time intervals, namely the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis. We
follow the evolution of these moments as the traffic condition changes from the
low-density free flow to high-density congestion. We find that the higher
moments of inter-vehicle spacings have a well defined dependence on the mean
value. The variance of the spacing distribution monotonously increases with the
mean vehicle spacing. In contrast, our analysis suggests that the skewness and
kurtosis provide one of the most sensitive probes towards the search for the
critical points. We find two significant results. First, the kurtosis
calculated in different time intervals for different lanes varies smoothly with
the skewness. They share the same behavior with the skewness and kurtosis
calculated for probability density functions that depend on a single parameter.
Second, the skewness and kurtosis as functions of the mean intervehicle spacing
show sharp peaks at critical densities expected for transitions between
different traffic phases. The data show a considerable scatter near the peak
positions, which suggests that the critical behavior may depend on other
parameters in addition to the traffic density.

above Pluto's surface at solar phase angles from ~20{\deg} to ~169{\deg}. The
haze is structured with about ~20 layers, and the extinction due to haze is
greater in the northern hemisphere than at equatorial or southern latitudes.
However, more haze layers are discerned at equatorial latitudes. A search for
temporal variations found no evidence for motions of haze layers (temporal
changes in layer altitudes) on time scales of 2 to 5 hours, but did find
evidence of changes in haze scale height above 100 km altitude. An ultraviolet
extinction attributable to the atmospheric haze was also detected by the ALICE
ultraviolet spectrograph on New Horizons. The haze particles are strongly
forward-scattering in the visible, and a microphysical model of haze is
presented which reproduces the visible phase function just above the surface

particles to fit the visible phase function at 45 km altitude and account for
UV extinction. A model of haze layer generation by orographic excitation of

thickness and distribution with altitude. Haze particles settle out of the

part of medical training. Having an automated system for surgical skills

have been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using
either video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an
analysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer
data). Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for
basic surgical skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and
accelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce ""entropy
based"" features - Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy
(XApEn), which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of
fluctuations in time-series data. The proposed features are compared to
existing methods of Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for surgical skills assessment.
Results: We report average performance of different features across all
applicable OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows
that the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art
methods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better
for suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features
can improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving
highest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be
achieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system
can significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical
schools and teaching hospitals.

serve different purposes. First, we identify normal parameters in which the
renormalisation group flows take their simplest form; normal correlators are
defined by functional differentiation with respect to these parameters. The
renormalised correlation functions are given by the continuum limit of
correlators associated to a cutoff-dependent parametrisation, which can be
related to the renormalisation group flows. The necessary linear and non-linear
counterterms in any arbitrary parametrisation arise in a natural way from a
change of coordinates. We show that, in a class of minimal subtraction schemes,
the renormalised correlators are exactly equal to normal correlators evaluated
at a finite cutoff. To illustrate the formalism and the main results, we
compare standard diagrammatic calculations in a scalar free-field theory with
the structure of the perturbative solutions to the Polchinski equation close to

that maximizes a certain metric of interest (e.g., click-through-rate, average
engagement time etc.) is crucial. We approach the aforementioned task from a
learning-to-rank perspective which reveals a new problem setup. In traditional
learning-to-rank literature, it is implicitly assumed that during the training
data generation one has access to the \emph{best or desired} order for the
given list of items. In this work, we consider a problem setup where we do not
observe the desired ranking. We present two novel solutions: the first solution
is an extension of already existing listwise learning-to-rank
technique--Listwise maximum likelihood estimation (ListMLE)--while the second
one is a generic machine learning based framework that tackles the problem in
its entire generality. We discuss several challenges associated with this
generic framework, and propose a simple \emph{item-payoff} and
\emph{positional-gain} model that addresses these challenges. We provide
training algorithms, inference procedures, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the two approaches over traditional ListMLE on synthetic as well as on
real-life setting of ranking news articles for increased dwell time.

primarily focuses on the precedents of the models above, examining how the

complexity of graphical models and many nowadays models are neural counterparts
of ancient linear models. This paper reviews these evolutionary paths and

provide a thorough background for deep learning. More importantly, along with
the path, this paper summarizes the gist behind these milestones and proposes

Considering MapReduce in Hadoop, the map task scheduling part requires an
efficient algorithm which takes data locality into consideration; otherwise,
the system may become unstable under loads inside the system's capacity region
and jobs may experience longer completion times which are not of interest. The
data chunk needed for any map task can be in memory, on a local disk, in a
local rack, in the same cluster or even in another data center. Hence, unless
there has been much work on improving the speed of data center networks,
different levels of service rates still exist for a task depending on where its
data chunk is saved and from which server it receives service. Most of the
theoretical work on load balancing is for systems with two levels of data
locality including the Pandas algorithm by Xie et al. and the JSQ-MW algorithm
by Wang et al., where the former is both throughput and heavy-traffic optimal,
while the latter is only throughput optimal, but heavy-traffic optimal in only
a special traffic load. We show that an extension of the JSQ-MW algorithm for a
system with thee levels of data locality is throughput optimal, but not
heavy-traffic optimal for all loads, only for a special traffic scenario.
Furthermore, we show that the Pandas algorithm is not even throughput optimal
for a system with three levels of data locality. We then propose a novel
algorithm, Balanced-Pandas, which is both throughput and heavy-traffic optimal.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical work on load
balancing for a system with more than two levels of data locality. This is more
challenging than two levels of data locality as a dilemma between performance

converge in high dimensions when the Gaussian assumption holds, but are

extremes. Using theoretical bounds and experiments, we show these estimators
strike a practical balance between robustness and scaling with dimensionality.

  Routing?",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We seek to understand when heterogeneity in user preferences yields improved
outcomes in terms of overall cost. That this might be hoped for is based on the
common belief that diversity is advantageous in many settings. We investigate
this in the context of routing. Our main result is a sharp characterization of
the network settings in which diversity always helps, versus those in which it
is sometimes harmful. Specifically, we consider routing games, where diversity
arises in the way that users trade-off two criteria (such as time and money,
or, in the case of stochastic delays, expectation and variance of delay). Our
main contributions are the following: 1) A participant-oriented measure of cost
in the presence of user diversity, together with the identification of the
natural benchmark: the same cost measure for an appropriately defined average
of the diversity. 2) A full characterization of those network topologies for
which diversity always helps, for all latency functions and demands. For
single-commodity routings, these are series-parallel graphs, while for
multi-commodity routings, they are the newly-defined ""block-matching"" networks.
The latter comprise a suitable interweaving of multiple series-parallel graphs
each connecting a distinct source-sink pair. While the result for the
single-commodity case may seem intuitive in light of the well-known Braess
paradox, the two problems are different: there are instances where diversity
helps although the Braess paradox occurs, and vice-versa. But the main
technical challenge is to establish the ""only if"" direction of the result for
multi-commodity networks. This follows by constructing an instance where
diversity hurts, and showing how to embed it in any network which is not
block-matching, by carefully exploiting the way the simple source-sink paths of
the commodities intersect in the ""non-block-matching"" portion of the network.

the difference between a security's price and the ground truth it estimates. We
consider cost-function-based prediction markets in which an automated market
maker adjusts security prices according to the history of trade. We decompose
the forecasting error into three components: sampling error, arising because
traders only possess noisy estimates of ground truth; market-maker bias,
resulting from the use of a particular market maker (i.e., cost function) to
facilitate trade; and convergence error, arising because, at any point in time,
market prices may still be in flux. Our goal is to make explicit the tradeoffs
between these error components, influenced by design decisions such as the
functional form of the cost function and the amount of liquidity in the market.
We consider a specific model in which traders have exponential utility and
exponential-family beliefs representing noisy estimates of ground truth. In
this setting, sampling error vanishes as the number of traders grows, but there
is a tradeoff between the other two components. We provide both upper and lower
bounds on market-maker bias and convergence error, and demonstrate via
numerical simulations that these bounds are tight. Our results yield new
insights into the question of how to set the market's liquidity parameter and
into the forecasting benefits of enforcing coherent prices across securities.

computationally costly networks are only necessary for a small fraction of

(AGN) disks. Here we parameterize the merger rates, the mass spectrum and the
spin spectrum of black holes (BH) in AGN disks. The predicted merger rate spans
$\sim 10^{-4}-10^{4} \rm{Gpc}^{-1} \rm{yr}^{-1}$, so upper limits from LIGO
($<212\rm{Gpc}^{-1}\rm{yr}^{-1}$) already constrain it. The predicted mass
spectrum has the form of a broken power-law consisting of a pre-existing BH
powerlaw mass spectrum and a harder powerlaw mass spectrum resulting from
mergers. The predicted spin spectrum is multi-peaked with the evolution of
retrograde spin BH in the gas disk playing a key role. We outline the large
uncertainties in each of these LIGO observables for this channel and we discuss
ways in which they can be constrained in the future.

braneworld model. To this end, we solve the braneworld generalization of the
stellar structure equations for a static fluid distribution with spherical
symmetry considering that the spacetime outside the star is described by a
Schwarzschild metric. First, the stellar structure equations are integrated
employing the so called causal limit equation of state (EOS), which is
constructed using a well established EOS at densities below a fiducial density,
and the causal EOS $P= \rho$ above it. It is a standard procedure in general
relativistic stellar structure calculations to use such EOS for obtaining a
limit in the mass radius diagram, known as causal limit, above which no stellar
configurations are possible if the EOS fulfills that the sound velocity is
smaller than the speed of light. We find that the equilibrium solutions in the
braneworld model can violate the general relativistic causal limit and, for
sufficiently large mass they approach asymptotically to the Schwarzschild limit
$M = 2 R$. Then, we investigate the properties of hadronic and strange quark
stars using two typical EOSs. For masses below $\sim 1.5 - 2 M_{\odot}$, the
mass versus radius curves show the typical behavior found within the frame of
General Relativity. However, we also find a new branch of stellar
configurations that can violate the general relativistic causal limit and that
in principle may have an arbitrarily large mass. The stars belonging to this
new branch are supported against collapse by the nonlocal effects of the bulk
on the brane. We also show that these stars are always stable under small
radial perturbations. These results support the idea that traces of
extra-dimensions might be found in astrophysics, specifically through the
analysis of masses and radii of compact objects.

work is a generalization of \cite{Kim}, in which the second author generalized
Perrin-Riou's Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with
supersingular reduction (\cite{Perrin-Riou}) to elliptic curves defined over
the above-mentioned number field $F$. On top of non-ordinary reduction and the
ramification of the field $F$, we deal with the additional difficulty that the
dimensions of the abelian varieties can be any number bigger than 1 which
causes a variety of issues. As a result, we obtain bounds for the ranks over
cyclotomic extensions $\mathbb{Q}(\mu_{p^{\max(M,N)+n}})$ of the Jacobian
varieties of {\it ramified} hyperelliptic curves $y^{2p^M}=x^{3p^N}+ax^{p^N}+b$

inhomogeneous chiral phase (iCP). The fluctuations are then bosonized and an
effective action for the chiral pair fluctuation is basically constructed by
considering the ring diagram of the polarization function. We can evaluate the
self-energy and effective four point interaction among fluctuations in a
consistent way. The peculiar dispersion of the fluctuation, reflecting the
spatially inhomogeneous transition, gives rise to interesting and qualitative
results. Thermal fluctuations prohibit the second-order transition, while the
effect of the quantum fluctuations is rather modest. Quantum and thermal
fluctuations changes the second-order transition to the first one by changing
the sign of the effective four-point interaction between effective mesons.
These features may be observed by relativistic heavy-ion collisions through the
analysis of the thermodynamic observables. Distinct from the second-order phase
transition, the first moment such as entropy production exhibits an anomalous
behavior due to fluctuations, which is one of the signals of the phase
transition to iCP. Some similar aspects are also remarked between iCP and the
FFLO state in superconductivity.

and treatment. However, variations in MRI acquisition protocols result in
different appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many
medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in
imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired
with one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with
different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated
legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a
recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the
following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image
analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, 1) How much data from the new domain is
required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, 2) What portion
of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number
of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted
extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We
trained a CNN on legacy MR images of brain and evaluated the performance of the
domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We
then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where
either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from
scratch on the new dataset.The domain-adapted network tuned only by two
training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a
similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.

Firstly, we propose a new rule for greedy selection based on an $\ell_1$-norm

algorithm called ""SOft ThreshOlding PrOjection (SOTOPO)"" is proposed to exactly
solve the $\ell_1$-regularized $\ell_1$-norm square approximation problem,

convergence rate $O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$, meanwhile, it reduces the iteration
complexity of greedy selection up to a factor of sample size. Both

interest about the magnetic field and physics of compact stars, where
microphysics such as QED or QCD may play active parts.
  Here we discuss the equation of state (EOS) of quark matter in the core of
compact stars by taking into account the strong magnetic field. We show that
quark EOS becomes very stiff in the presence of the strong magnetic field, and
becomes stiffest under the causality condition beyond the threshold strength of
$B_c\sim O(10^{19})$ G. This is because quarks make the Landau levels in the
presence of the magnetic field and thereby only the lowest Landau level is
occupied in the extreme case beyond $B_c$. Thus quarks can freely move along
the magnetic field with localization in the perpendicular plane, which
resembles the quasi-one dimensional systems and gives rise to a stiff EOS.
Consequently, we may easily produce high-mass stars beyond two solar mass.
  As another interesting possibility, we discuss the appearance of the third
family of compact stars, succeeding white dwarfs and neutron stars, before
collapsing into black holes. We demonstrate an example, which is specified by a
discontinuous increase of the adiabatic index at the hadron-quark phase
transition. Such new family may affect the supernova explosions or the
gravitational wave emitted from the neutron star mergers.

application aspects. The fundamental issues of the electronic conduction
properties of ITO from 300 K down to low temperatures have rarely been
addressed. Studies of the electrical-transport properties over a wide range of
temperature are essential to unraveling the underlying electronic dynamics and
microscopic electronic parameters. We show that one can learn rich physics in
ITO material, including the semi-classical Boltzmann transport, the
quantum-interference electron transport, and the electron-electron interaction
effects in the presence of disorder and granularity. To reveal the
opportunities that the ITO material provides for fundamental research, we
demonstrate a variety of charge transport properties in different forms of ITO
structures, including homogeneous polycrystalline films, homogeneous
single-crystalline nanowires, and inhomogeneous ultrathin films. We not only
address new physics phenomena that arise in ITO but also illustrate the
versatility of the stable ITO material forms for potential applications. We
emphasize that, microscopically, the rich electronic conduction properties of
ITO originate from the inherited free-electron-like energy bandstructure and
low-carrier concentration (as compared with that in typical metals)
characteristics of this class of material. Furthermore, a low carrier
concentration leads to slow electron-phonon relaxation, which causes ($i$) a
small residual resistance ratio, ($ii$) a linear electron diffusion
thermoelectric power in a wide temperature range 1-300 K, and ($iii$) a weak
electron dephasing rate. We focus our discussion on the metallic-like ITO

governing the latitudinal and radial motion are introduced and their behaviour
is examined by 'Chinese boxes' technique giving regions allowed for the motion

the issue of the interactions of plasma proteins with polymer coated surfaces.
To this aim, we use a non-covalent grafting-to method to functionalize iron

protein responses. The functionalized copolymers consist in alternating
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains and phosphonic acid grafted on the same

polymer adsorption kinetics and to evaluate the resistance to protein
adsorption. On flat substrates, functionalized PEG copolymers adsorb and form a
brush in the moderate or in the highly stretched regimes, with density between
0.15 and 1.5 nm-2. PEG layers using phosphonic acid as linkers exhibit
excellent protein resistance. In contrast, layers prepared with carboxylic acid
as grafting agent exhibit mitigated protein responses and layer
destructuration. The present study establishes a correlation between the
long-term stability of PEG coated particles in biofluids and the protein

investigating the Debye-Waller factor f_{q} and relaxation time \tau_{\alpha}

based on a novel $\textit{risk}$ criterion called the minimum probability of
error (MPE), which measures the probability that the estimated parameter lies
outside an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of the actual value. However, the MPE,
similar to the mean-squared error (MSE), depends on the ground-truth parameter,
and has to be estimated from the noisy observations. We consider linear
shrinkage-based denoising functions, wherein the optimum shrinkage parameter is
obtained by minimizing an estimate of the MPE. When the probability of error is
integrated over $\epsilon$, it leads to the expected $\ell_1$ distortion. The
proposed MPE and $\ell_1$ distortion formulations are applicable to various
noise distributions by invoking a Gaussian mixture model approximation. Within
the realm of MPE, we also develop an extension of the transform-domain
shrinkage by grouping transform coefficients, resulting in $\textit{subband
shrinkage}$. The denoising performance obtained within the proposed framework
is shown to be better than that obtained using the minimum MSE-based approaches
formulated within $\textbf{$\textit {Stein's unbiased risk estimation}$}$
(SURE) framework, especially in the low measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime. Performance comparison with three state-of-the-art denoising
algorithms, carried out on electrocardiogram signals and two test signals taken

gateway of all evolved compact binaries, all stellar mergers and likely many of
the stellar transients witnessed to date. Common envelope simulations are
needed to understand this interaction and to interpret stars and binaries
thought to be the byproduct of this stage. At this time, simulations are unable
to reproduce the few observational data available and several ideas have been
put forward to address their shortcomings. The need for more definitive
simulation validation is pressing, and is already being fulfilled by
observations from time-domain surveys. In this article, we present an initial
method and its implementation for post-processing grid-based common envelope
simulations to produce the light-curve so as to compare simulations with
upcoming observations. Here we implemented a zeroth order method to calculate
the light emitted from common envelope hydrodynamic simulations carried out
with the 3D hydrodynamic code Enzo used in uni-grid mode. The code implements
an approach for the computation of luminosity in both optically thick and
optically thin regimes and is tested using the first 135 days of the common
envelope simulation of Passy et al. (2012), where a 0.8 solar masses red giant
branch star interacts with a 0.6 solar masses companion. This code is used to
highlight two large obstacles that need to be overcome before realistic light
curves can be calculated. We explain the nature of these problems and the
attempted solutions and approximations in full detail to enable the next step
to be identified and implemented. We also discuss our simulation in relation to

mass scales : anisotropy $\rho$, temperature T and chemical potential $\mu$. We
find this solution upto second order in the dilaton anisotropy parameter
$\rho$. This blackbrane solution corresponds to an anisotropic phase where the
anisotropy is small compared to the temperature and chemical potential. We find
that in this anisotropic phase, some components of the anisotropic shear
viscosity tensor, which are spin one with respect to the residual symmetry
after breaking rotational invariance, violates the KSS bound (${\eta \over
s}\ge {1 \over 4 \pi} $) proposed by Kovtun, Son and Starinets. We identify the
regions of the parameter space where these violations are significant. We carry
out a similar analysis in 4 dimensions and find similar violation of the KSS
bound for the spin one components to demonstrate the generality of the result.
Our results are particularly relevant in the context of strongly coupled
systems found in nature. We also provide an intuitive understanding of the
results using dimensional reduction and a Boltzmann calculation in a weakly
coupled version of a similar system. The Boltzmann analysis performed in a
system of weakly interacting particles in a linear potential also shows that
components of the viscosity tensor may be reduced. It is intriguing that the

transmission is adopted at the PS to focus the energy signals on the wireless

the outage probability and the average throughput of information transfer,

the system performance as a function of the number of PS transmit antennas, the

for difficult constraint programming problems where problem construction and

programming. However, in general, filtering that is sound for a global
constraint can be unsound when the constraint is open. This paper provides a
simple characterization, called contractibility, of the constraints where
filtering remains sound when the constraint is open. With this characterization
we can easily determine whether a constraint has this property or not. In the
latter case, we can use it to derive a contractible approximation to the

functions defined on possibly different homotopy equivalent topological spaces.
The underlying idea in the definition of dHT is to measure the minimal shift
that is necessary to apply to one of the two functions in order that the
sublevel sets of the two functions become homotopically equivalent. This
distance is interesting in connection with persistent homology. Indeed, our
main result states that dHT still provides an upper bound for the bottleneck
distance between the persistence diagrams of the intervening functions.
Moreover, because homotopy equivalences are weaker than homeomorphisms, this
implies a lifting of the standard stability results provided by the L-infty
distance and the natural pseudo-distance dNP. From a different standpoint, we
prove that dHT extends the L-infty distance and dNP in two ways. First, we show
that, appropriately restricting the category of objects to which dHT applies,
it can be made to coincide with the other two distances. Finally, we show that
dHT has an interpretation in terms of interleavings that naturally places it in
the family of distances used in persistence theory.

its coupling strength is adaptively controlled by a local order parameter. We
find that this model displays either CS or ES in two limits. In between the two
limits, this model exhibits both CS and ES, where CS can be observed for a
fixed coupling strength and ES appears when the coupling is increased
adiabatically. Moreover, we show both theoretically and numerically that there

non-zero components change their location independently with probability $p$.
The statistical problem is to decide whether the signal is a zero vector or in

observations of individual signal components collected at times $t=1,\ldots,m$.
We consider two different sensing paradigms, namely adaptive and non-adaptive
sensing. For non-adaptive sensing the choice of components to measure has to be
decided before the data collection process started, while for adaptive sensing
one can adjust the sensing process based on observations collected earlier. We
characterize the difficulty of this detection problem in both sensing paradigms
in terms of the aforementioned parameters, with special interest to the speed
of change of the active components. In addition we provide an adaptive sensing
algorithm for this problem and contrast its performance to that of non-adaptive
detection algorithms.

underlie the development of modern society, but the in-depth understanding of
their behavioral patterns in open online communities is very challenging. The
availability of large volumes of data in open-source software (OSS)
repositories (e.g. bug tracking data, emails, and comments) enables us to
investigate this issue in a quantitative way. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical analysis of online collaborative activities closely related to assure
software quality in two well-known OSS communities, namely Eclipse and Mozilla.
Our main findings include two aspects: (1) developers exhibit two diametrically
opposite behavioral patterns in spatial and temporal scale when they work under
two different states (i.e. normal and overload), and (2) the processing times
(including bug fixing times and bug tossing times) follow a stretched
exponential distribution instead of the common power law distribution. Our work
reveals regular patterns in human dynamics beyond online collaborative
activities among skilled developers who work under different task-driven load
conditions, and it could be an important supplementary to the current work on
human dynamics.

of stars is much more complex than previously envisioned. Instead of the
traditional steady, one-dimensional solution, accretion may be episodic and not
necessarily symmetrical, thereby affecting the energy deposited inside the star
and its interior structure. Given this new framework, we want to understand
what controls the evolution of accreting stars. We use the MESA stellar
evolution code with various sets of conditions. In particular, we account for
the (unknown) efficiency of accretion in burying gravitational energy into the
protostar through a parameter, $\xi$, and we vary the amount of deuterium
present. We confirm the findings of previous works that the evolution changes
significantly with the amount of energy that is lost during accretion. We find
that deuterium burning also regulates the PMS evolution. In the low-entropy
accretion scenario, the evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram are
significantly different from the classical tracks and are sensitive to the
deuterium content. A comparison of theoretical evolutionary tracks and
observations allows us to exclude some cold accretion models ($\xi\sim 0$) with
low deuterium abundances. We confirm that the luminosity spread seen in
clusters can be explained by models with a somewhat inefficient injection of
accretion heat. The resulting evolutionary tracks then become sensitive to the
accretion heat efficiency, initial core entropy, and deuterium content. In this
context, we predict that clusters with a higher D/H ratio should have less
scatter in luminosity than clusters with a smaller D/H. Future work on this
issue should include radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to determine the
efficiency of accretion heating and further observations to investigate the
deuterium content in star-forming regions. (abbrev.)

from finely resolved large eddy and direct numerical simulations. They are
parameterized by a mean and a covariance operator. Addressing applications to
large eddy simulations, the mean and the covariance depend on the resolved

Gaussian information structures. Agents apply a heuristic rule to aggregate
predecessors' actions. They weigh these actions according the strengths of
their social connections to different predecessors. We show this rule arises
endogenously when agents wrongly believe others act solely on private
information and thus neglect redundancies among observations. We provide a
simple linear formula expressing agents' actions in terms of network paths and
use this formula to characterize the set of networks where naive agents
eventually learn correctly. This characterization implies that, on all networks
where later agents observe more than one neighbor, there exist
disproportionately influential early agents who can cause herding on incorrect
actions. Going beyond existing social-learning results, we compute the
probability of such mislearning exactly. This allows us to compare likelihoods
of incorrect herding, and hence expected welfare losses, across network
structures. The probability of mislearning increases when link densities are
higher and when networks are more integrated. In partially segregated networks,
divergent early signals can lead to persistent disagreement between groups.

field is considered and trajectories are found for various spin orientations.
We study the acceleration of spinning particles by an electric field, as well
as the electric and magnetic deflection in constant homogeneous fields. It is
shown that the classical Lorentz-Einstein theory of motion of charged particles
is a special case of the proposed theory
