unprecedented quality that a detailed asteroseismic analysis becomes possible.
For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation
frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation
codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The
results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the
rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus
indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at
work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13
low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first
nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied
previously Corsaro et al. 2015, which not only have a large number of extracted
oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications We aim to
extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by
theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive
the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these
methods with each other. We built seismic models using a grid search combined
with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing
Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those
obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. We find that
the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster
than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation
rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets,
while some discrepancies exist for others.

intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning with
dose-volume constraints (DVCs) included in the planning algorithm is presented.
It involves a new type of sparsity constraint that enables the inclusion of a
percentage-violation constraint in the model problem and its handling by
continuous (as opposed to integer) methods. We propose an iterative algorithmic
framework for solving such a problem by applying the feasibility-seeking
CQ-algorithm of Byrne combined with the automatic relaxation method (ARM) that
uses cyclic projections. Detailed implementation instructions are furnished.
Functionality of the algorithm was demonstrated through the creation of an
intensity-modulated proton therapy plan for a simple 2D C-shaped geometry and
also for a realistic base-of-skull chordoma treatment site. Monte Carlo
simulations of proton pencil beams of varying energy were conducted to obtain
dose distributions for the 2D test case. A research release of the Pinnacle3
proton treatment planning system was used to extract pencil beam doses for a
clinical base-of-skull chordoma case. In both cases the beamlet doses were
calculated to satisfy dose-volume constraints according to our new algorithm.
Examination of the dose-volume histograms following inverse planning with our
algorithm demonstrated that it performed as intended. The application of our
proposed algorithm to dose-volume constraint inverse planning was successfully
demonstrated. Comparison with optimized dose distributions from the research
release of the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system showed the algorithm could
achieve equivalent or superior results.

intermediate-term middle range prediction of main shocks above a pre-assigned
threshold, based on seismicity patterns. Few years ago, a first attempt was
made in the framework of project SISMA, funded by Italian Space Agency, to
jointly use seismological tools, like CN algorithm and scenario earthquakes,
and geodetic methods and techniques, like GPS and SAR monitoring, in order to
effectively constrain priority areas where to concentrate prevention and
seismic risk mitigation. We present a further development of integration of
seismological and geodetic information, clearly showing the contribution of
geodesy to the understanding and prediction of earthquakes. As a relevant
application, the seismic crisis that started in Central Italy in August 2016 is
considered in a retrospective analysis. Differently from the much more common
approach, here GPS data are not used to estimate the standard 2D velocity and
strain field in the area, but to reconstruct the velocity and strain pattern
along transects, which are properly oriented according to the a priori
information about the known tectonic setting. Overall, the analysis of the
available geodetic data indicates that it is possible to highlight the velocity
variation and the related strain accumulation in the area of Amatrice event,
within the area alarmed by CN since November 1st, 2012. The considered counter
examples, across CN alarmed and not-alarmed areas, do not show any comparable
spatial acceleration localized trend. Therefore, we show that the combined
analysis of the results of CN prediction algorithms, with those from the
processing of adequately dense and permanent GNSS network data, may allow the
routine highlight in advance of the strain accumulation. Thus it is possible to
significantly reduce the size of the CN alarmed areas.

especially for frequencies below 10~GHz. Governments, who influence the
regulatory authorities around the world, have resorted to auctioning the use of

USD are being paid for modest bandwidths.
  The earth observation, astronomy and similar science driven communities
cannot compete financially with such a pressure system, so this is where
governments have to step in and assess /regulate the situation.
  It has been a pleasure to see a situation where the communications and
broadcast communities have come together to formulate sharing of an important
part of the spectrum (roughly, 50 MHz to 800 MHz) in an IEEE standard,
IEEE802.22. This standard (known as the ""TV White Space Network"" (built on
lower level standards) shows a way that fixed and mobile users can collaborate
in geographically widespread regions, using cognitive radio and geographic
databases of users. This White Space (WS) standard is well described in the
literature and is not the major topic of this short paper.
  We wish to extend the idea of the WS concept to include the idea of EM
sensors (such as Radar) adopting this approach to spectrum sharing, providing a
quantum leap in access to spectrum. We postulate that networks of sensors,
using the tools developed by the WS community, can replace and enhance our
present set of EM sensors.
  We first define what Networks of Sensors entail (with some history), and then
go on to define, based on a Taxonomy of Symbiosis defined by de
Bary\cite{symb}, how these sensors and other users (especially communications)
can co-exist. This new taxonomy is important for understanding, and should
replace somewhat outdated terminologies from the radar world.

the main structural features are preserved, subtle conformational changes do
take place in the first ~0.1 ms of dynamics. In addition, intramolecular proton
dynamics processes occur on the ps-timescale in the gas phase as emerging from
quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations at the B3LYP level of

fly time in ESI-MS experiments (typically on the ms timescale). However, the
structural changes associated with the process do not significantly affect the

extending them to the controlled operations, we define a quantum-controlled Cop
and Robber game, which expands the classical Cop and Robber game, as well as
the classically controlled quantum Cop and Robber game. In contrast to the
typical scheme for introducing quantum games, we assume that both parties can
utilise full information about the opponent's strategy. We show that the
utilisation of the full knowledge about the opponent's state does not provide
the advantage. Moreover, the chances of catching the Robber decrease for
classical cop-win graphs. This result does not depend on the chosen model of
evolution. On the other hand, the possibility to execute controlled quantum
operations allows catching the Robber on almost all classical cop-win graphs.
By this, we demonstrate that it is necessary to enrich the structure of
correlations between the players' systems to provide a non-trivial quantized
Cop and Robber game. Thus the quantum controlled operations offer a significant
advantage over the classically controlled quantum operations.

to achieve good alignment and it is easy to break image structures due to
insufficient and unreliable point correspondences. Moreover, because of the
viewpoint variations between multiple images, the stitched images suffer from
projective distortions. To solve these problems, this paper presents a
line-guided local warping method with a global similarity constraint for image
stitching. Line features which serve well for geometric descriptions and scene
constraints, are employed to guide image stitching accurately. On one hand, the
line features are integrated into a local warping model through a designed
weight function. On the other hand, line features are adopted to impose strong
geometric constraints, including line correspondence and line colinearity, to
improve the stitching performance through mesh optimization. To mitigate
projective distortions, we adopt a global similarity constraint, which is
integrated with the projective warps via a designed weight strategy. This
constraint causes the final warp to slowly change from a projective to a
similarity transformation across the image. Finally, the images undergo a
two-stage alignment scheme that provides accurate alignment and reduces
projective distortion. We evaluate our method on a series of images and compare
it with several other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method provides a convincing stitching performance and that it
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

system with obligations in multiple illiquid assets (e.g., currencies). In so
doing, we develop a multi-layered financial network that extends the single
network of Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In particular, we develop a financial
contagion model with fire sales that allows institutions to both buy and sell
assets to cover their liabilities in the different assets and act as utility
maximizers.
  We prove that, under standard assumptions and without market impacts,
equilibrium portfolio holdings exist and are unique. However, with market
impacts, we prove that equilibrium portfolio holdings and market prices exist
which clear the multi-layered financial system. In general, though, these
clearing solutions are not unique. We extend this result by considering the
t\^atonnement process to find the unique attained equilibrium. The attained
equilibrium need not be continuous with respect to the initial shock; these
points of discontinuity match those stresses in which a financial crisis
becomes a systemic crisis. We further provide mathematical formulations for
payment rules and utility functions satisfying the necessary conditions for
these existence and uniqueness results.

that viable f(T) models can successfully satisfy the BBN constraints.

algorithms. As such, it is important to design sorting algorithms that approach
peak performance on a range of hardware architectures. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) are particularly attractive architectures as they provides massive
parallelism and computing power. However, the intricacies of their compute and
memory hierarchies make designing GPU-efficient algorithms challenging. In this
work we present GPU Multiway Mergesort (MMS), a new GPU-efficient multiway
mergesort algorithm. MMS employs a new partitioning technique that exposes the
parallelism needed by modern GPU architectures. To the best of our knowledge,
MMS is the first sorting algorithm for the GPU that is asymptotically optimal
in terms of global memory accesses and that is completely free of shared memory
bank conflicts.
  We realize an initial implementation of MMS, evaluate its performance on
three modern GPU architectures, and compare it to competitive implementations
available in state-of-the-art GPU libraries. Despite these implementations
being highly optimized, MMS compares favorably, achieving performance
improvements for most random inputs. Furthermore, unlike MMS, state-of-the-art
algorithms are susceptible to bank conflicts. We find that for certain inputs
that cause these algorithms to incur large numbers of bank conflicts, MMS can
achieve up to a 37.6% speedup over its fastest competitor. Overall, even though
its current implementation is not fully optimized, due to its efficient use of
the memory hierarchy, MMS outperforms the fastest comparison-based sorting
implementations available to date.

balance case, where we derive a completely decentralized strategy without the
need for communication between control areas. It can adapt to unknown load
disturbance. The tie-line powers are restored after load disturbance, while the
regulation capacity constraints are satisfied both at equilibrium and during
transient. We show that the closed-loop systems with the proposed control
strategies carry out primal-dual updates for solving the associated centralized
frequency optimization problems. We further prove the closed-loop systems are
asymptotically stable and converge to the unique optimal solution of the
centralized frequency optimization problems and their duals. Finally, we

the acquisition of full network state information, a hierarchical scheme is
proposed, based on which local state estimates are aggregated up the hierarchy
to obtain aggregate state information at multiple scales, which are then sent
back to each cell for local decision making. Thus, each cell obtains
fine-grained estimates of the channel occupancies of nearby cells, but
coarse-grained estimates of those of distant cells. The performance of the
aggregation scheme is studied in terms of the trade-off between the throughput
achievable by secondary users and the interference generated by the activity of
these secondary users to primary users. In order to account for the irregular
structure of interference patterns arising from path loss, shadowing, and
blockages, which are especially relevant in millimeter wave networks, a greedy
algorithm is proposed to find a multi-scale aggregation tree to optimize the
performance. It is shown numerically that this tailored hierarchy outperforms a
regular tree construction by 60%.

deliver state-of-the-art results in this domain. Such networks intuitively
appear to incur high computational cost, and require the storage of a large
number of parameters, which renders them unfeasible for deployment in portable
devices. To solve this problem, we propose a Global Supervised Low-rank
Expansion (GSLRE) method and an Adaptive Drop-weight (ADW) technique to solve
the problems of speed and storage capacity. We design a nine-layer CNN for HCCR
consisting of 3,755 classes, and devise an algorithm that can reduce the
networks computational cost by nine times and compress the network to 1/18 of
the original size of the baseline model, with only a 0.21% drop in accuracy. In
tests, the proposed algorithm surpassed the best single-network performance
reported thus far in the literature while requiring only 2.3 MB for storage.
Furthermore, when integrated with our effective forward implementation, the
recognition of an offline character image took only 9.7 ms on a CPU. Compared
with the state-of-the-art CNN model for HCCR, our approach is approximately 30
times faster, yet 10 times more cost efficient.

heterogeneity is therefore critical to precise cancer prognosis and treatment.
In this paper, we introduce BayCount, a Bayesian decomposition method to infer
tumor heterogeneity with highly over-dispersed RNA sequencing count data. Using
negative binomial factor analysis, BayCount takes into account both the
between-sample and gene-specific random effects on raw counts of sequencing
reads mapped to each gene. For posterior inference, we develop an efficient
compound Poisson based blocked Gibbs sampler. Through extensive simulation
studies and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer and kidney cancer
RNA sequencing count data, we show that BayCount is able to accurately estimate
the number of subclones, the proportions of these subclones in each tumor
sample, and the gene expression profiles in each subclone. Our method
represents the first effort in characterizing tumor heterogeneity using RNA
sequencing count data that simultaneously removes the need of normalizing the
counts, achieves statistical robustness, and obtains biologically and
clinically meaningful insights.

population distribution maps at a fine scale using VHR satellite images has
become a hot topic. Previous studies have focused solely on individual tasks
with elaborate hand-crafted features and have ignored the relationship between
different tasks. In this study, we aim to propose a universal framework which
can: 1) automatically learn the internal feature representation from the raw
image data; and 2) simultaneously produce fine-scale land-use, urban density,

neural network (CNN) is applied to learn the hierarchical feature
representation from the raw image data. For the second target, a novel
CNN-based universal framework is proposed to process the VHR satellite images
and generate the land-use, urban density, and population distribution maps. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first CNN-based mega-city analysis
method which can process a VHR remote sensing image with such a large data
volume. A VHR satellite image (1.2 m spatial resolution) of the center of Wuhan
covering an area of 2606 km2 was used to evaluate the proposed method. The
experimental results confirm that the proposed method can achieve a promising

examine whether external radiative forcing, i.e. starlight, could be a driver
for global oscillations in hot Jupiters orbiting various main-sequence stars at
defined orbital semimajor axes. Using planetary models generated by the Modules

likely be excited via the suppression of radiative cooling due to external
radiation given a large enough stellar flux and the absence of a significant

networks, many incentive mechanisms and policies have been proposed in recent
years. Global peer ranking is one such mechanism. In this mechanism, peers are
ranked based on a metric called contribution index. Contribution index is
defined in such a manner that peers are motivated to share the resources in the
network. Fairness in the terms of upload to download ratio in each peer can be
achieved by this method. However, calculation of contribution index is not
trivial. It is computed distributively and iteratively in the entire network
and requires strict clock synchronization among the peers. A very small error
in clock synchronization may lead to wrong results. Furthermore, iterative
calculation requires a lot of message overhead and storage capacity, which
makes its implementation more complex. In this paper, we are proposing a simple
incentive mechanism based on the contributions of peers, which can balance the
upload and download amount of resources in each peer. It does not require
iterative calculation, therefore, can be implemented with lesser message
overhead and storage capacity without requiring strict clock synchronization.
This approach is efficient as there are very less rejections among the
cooperative peers. It can be implemented in a truly distributed fashion with
$O(N)$ time complexity per peer.

accurate analysis of vast areas. Due to a low spatial resolution, a pixel of a
hyperspectral image rarely represents a single material, but rather a mixture
of different spectra. HSU aims at estimating the pure spectra present in the
scene of interest, referred to as endmembers, and their fractions in each
pixel, referred to as abundances. Today, many HSU algorithms have been
proposed, based either on a geometrical or statistical model. While most
methods assume that the number of endmembers present in the scene is known,
there is only little work about estimating this number from the observed data.
In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework that jointly
estimates the number of endmembers, the endmembers itself, and their
abundances, by making use of the Indian Buffet Process as a prior for the
endmembers. Simulation results and experiments on real data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, yielding results comparable with
state-of-the-art methods while being able to reliably infer the number of
endmembers. In scenarios with strong noise, where other algorithms provide only
poor results, the proposed approach tends to overestimate the number of
endmembers slightly. The additional endmembers, however, often simply represent
noisy replicas of present endmembers and could easily be merged in a
post-processing step.

necessarily translate into an improved accuracy. We find that a beneficial

training of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for semantic segmentation being
agnostic towards the `structure' of the predicted label maps, valuable
complementary information about the global quality of the segmentation lies
idle. In order to tap into this potential, we propose utilizing an adversarial

learned parametrization of what makes a good segmentation at a global level, we
hypothesize that the method holds particular advantages for segmentation tasks

learn to segment aggressive prostate cancer utilizing MRI images of 152

particles, yet there is at present no proposal for the bulk theory. As SYK is
solvable in the $1/N$ expansion, one can systematically derive the bulk. We
initiate such a program, by analyzing the fermion two, four and six-point
functions, from which we extract the tower of singlet, large $N$ dominant,
operators, their dimensions, and their three-point correlation functions. These
determine the masses of the bulk fields and their cubic couplings. We present
these couplings, analyze their structure and discuss the simplifications that
arise for large $q$.

TPE amplitudes and compared to previous extractions, TPE calculations, and
direct measurements at $Q^2$ = 2.50 (GeV/c)$^2$. The extracted TPE amplitudes
are on the few-percentage-points level and behave roughly linearly with
increasing $Q^2$ where they become nonlinear at high $Q^2$. Contrary to $Y_M$,

influenced by inelastic contributions at large $Q^2$ values. While $Y_E$ and
$Y_3$ differ in magnitude, they have opposite sign and tend to partially cancel

modeling the phenomenology of these stochastic dynamics has predominantly
focused on one model, Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which can be described
as the solution of a Langevin equation with linear drift and linear
multiplicative noise. Using recent experimental results on stochastic
exponential growth of individual bacterial cell sizes, we motivate the need for
a more general class of phenomenological models of stochastic exponential
growth, which are consistent with the observation that the mean-rescaled
distributions are approximately stationary at long times. We show that this
behavior is not consistent with GBM, instead it is consistent with power law
multiplicative noise with positive fractional powers. Therefore, we consider
this general class of phenomenological models for stochastic exponential
growth, provide analytical solutions, and identify the important dimensionless
combination of model parameters which determines the shape of the mean-rescaled
distribution. We also provide a prescription for robustly inferring model
parameters from experimentally observed stochastic growth trajectories.

practical tradeoff between switch - controller traffic, and the number of
entries required in the switch flow table. Based on different parameters, we
differentiate between heavy flows, elephant flows and bulky flows and present
efficient algorithms to detect flows of the different types.
  Additionally, as part of our heavy flow detection scheme, we present sampling
methods to sample packets with arbitrary probability $p$ per packet or per byte
that traverses an SDN switch.
  Finally, we show how our algorithms can be adapted to a distributed
monitoring SDN setting with multiple switches, and easily scale with the number
of monitoring switches.

this result is proved over any Galois field. That is, exponential sums over
Galois fields of rotation symmetric polynomials satisfy linear recurrences with
integer coefficients. In the particular case of $\mathbb{F}_2$, an elementary
method is used to obtain explicit recurrences for exponential sums of some of
these functions. The concept of trapezoid Boolean function is also introduced
and it is showed that the linear recurrences that exponential sums of trapezoid
Boolean functions satisfy are the same as the ones satisfied by exponential
sums of the corresponding rotations symmetric Boolean functions. Finally, it is
proved that exponential sums of trapezoid and symmetric polynomials also

on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Pathfinder. Its
large instantaneous field of view (FoV) and relative thermal insensitivity
allow us to probe the ultra-bright tail of the FRB distribution, and to test a
recent claim that this distribution's slope, $\alpha\equiv-\frac{\partial \log
N}{\partial \log S}$, is quite small. A 256-input incoherent beamformer was
deployed on the CHIME Pathfinder for this purpose. If the FRB distribution were
described by a single power-law with $\alpha=0.7$, we would expect an FRB
detection every few days, making this the fastest survey on sky at present. We
collected 1268 hours of data, amounting to one of the largest exposures of any
FRB survey, with over 2.4\,$\times$\,10$^5$\,deg$^2$\,hrs. Having seen no
bursts, we have constrained the rate of extremely bright events to
$<\!13$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ above $\sim$\,220$\sqrt{(\tau/\rm ms)}$ Jy\,ms
for $\tau$ between 1.3 and 100\,ms, at 400--800\,MHz. The non-detection also
allows us to rule out $\alpha\lesssim0.9$ with 95$\%$ confidence, after
marginalizing over uncertainties in the GBT rate at 700--900\,MHz, though we
show that for a cosmological population and a large dynamic range in flux
density, $\alpha$ is brightness-dependent. Since FRBs now extend to large
enough distances that non-Euclidean effects are significant, there is still
expected to be a dearth of faint events and relative excess of bright events.
Nevertheless we have constrained the allowed number of ultra-intense FRBs.
While this does not have significant implications for deeper, large-FoV surveys
like full CHIME and APERTIF, it does have important consequences for other
wide-field, small dish experiments.

importance in understanding its interactions with the global ocean circulation
and the climate system as a whole. Here, a study of eddy-mixing entropy in a
forced-dissipative barotropic ocean model is presented. Entropy is a concept of
fundamental importance in statistical physics and information theory; motivated
by equilibrium statistical mechanics theories of ideal geophysical fluids, we
consider the effect of forcing and dissipation on eddy-mixing entropy, both
analytically and numerically. By diagnosing the time evolution of eddy-mixing
entropy it is shown that the entropy provides a descriptive tool for
understanding three stages of the turbulence life cycle: growth of instability,
formation of large scale structures and steady state fluctuations. Further, by
determining the relationship between the time evolution of entropy and the
maximum entropy principle, evidence is found for the action of this principle
in a forced-dissipative flow. The maximum entropy potential vorticity
statistics are calculated for the flow and are compared with numerical
simulations. Deficiencies of the maximum entropy statistics are discussed in
the context of the mean-field approximation for energy. This study highlights
the importance entropy and statistical mechanics in the study of geostrophic
turbulence.

until recovery is complete, especially in applications with large devices and
high transaction volume. Previous work introduced a technique called
single-pass restore, which increases restore bandwidth and thus substantially
decreases time to repair. Instant restore goes further as it permits read/write
access to any data on a device undergoing restore--even data not yet
restored--by restoring individual data segments on demand. Thus, the restore
process is guided primarily by the needs of applications, and the observed mean
time to repair is effectively reduced from several hours to a few seconds.
  This paper presents an implementation and evaluation of instant restore. The
technique is incrementally implemented on a system starting with the
traditional ARIES design for logging and recovery. Experiments show that the
transaction latency perceived after a media failure can be cut down to less
than a second and that the overhead imposed by the technique on normal

added to the system using simple and low-overhead software techniques.

facilitated with cache memories. Lower and upper bounds are derived on the
capacity-memory tradeoff, i.e., on the largest rate of reliable communication
over the BC as a function of the receivers' cache sizes, and the bounds are
shown to match for some special cases. The lower bounds are achieved by two new
coding schemes that benefit from non-uniform cache assignment. Lower and upper
bounds are also established on the global capacity-memory tradeoff, i.e., on
the largest capacity-memory tradeoff that can be attained by optimizing the
receivers' cache sizes subject to a total cache memory budget. The bounds
coincide when the total cache memory budget is sufficiently small or
sufficiently large, characterized in terms of the BC statistics. For small
cache memories, it is optimal to assign all the cache memory to the weakest
receiver. In this regime, the global capacity-memory tradeoff grows as the
total cache memory budget divided by the number of files in the system. In
other words, a perfect global caching gain is achievable in this regime and the
performance corresponds to a system where all cache contents in the network are
available to all receivers. For large cache memories, it is optimal to assign a
positive cache memory to every receiver such that the weaker receivers are
assigned larger cache memories compared to the stronger receivers. In this
regime, the growth rate of the global capacity-memory tradeoff is further
divided by the number of users, which corresponds to a local caching gain.
Numerical indicate suggest that a uniform cache-assignment of the total cache
memory is suboptimal in all regimes unless the BC is completely symmetric. For
erasure BCs, this claim is proved analytically in the regime of small

infection rate $\lambda$ has a maximal threshold

Lagrange multiplier method (LMM) to derive the analytical expression of optimal
allocation of the curing rates and the corresponding minimized prevalence. For
general infection region ($\lambda>\lambda_c^{opt}$), the high-dimensional
optimization problem is converted into numerically solving low-dimensional
nonlinear equations by the HMF theory and LMM. Counterintuitively, in the
strong infection region the low-degree nodes should be allocated more medical
resources than the high-degree nodes to minimize the prevalence. Finally, we
use simulated annealing to validate the theoretical results.

metallic or insulating), our results show that away from half-filling, a mixed
phase of metallic and insulating regions occur. As the dopant concentration is
increased, the metallic part progressively grows in volume, until it exceeds
the percolation threshold, leading to percolative conduction. This happens
above a critical dopant concentration $\delta_c$, which, depending on the
strength of the electron-lattice interaction, can be a significant fraction of
unity. This means that the material could be insulating even for a substantial
amount of doping, in contrast to the expectation that doped holes would destroy
the insulating behavior of the half-filled Hubbard model. Our theory provides a
framework for the understanding of the density-driven metal-insulator
transition observed in many complex oxides.
