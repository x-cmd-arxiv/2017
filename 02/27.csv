"1702.08051","Sylvain Hall\'e","Sylvain Hall\'e","From Complex Event Processing to Simple Event Processing","40 pages",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems in Computer Science can be framed as the computation of queries
over sequences, or ""streams"" of data units called events. The field of Complex
Event Processing (CEP) relates to the techniques and tools developed to
efficiently process these queries. However, most CEP systems developed so far
have concentrated on relatively narrow types of queries, which consist of
sliding windows, aggregation functions, and simple sequential patterns computed
over events that have a fixed tuple structure. Many of them boast throughput,
but in counterpart, they are difficult to setup and cumbersome to extend with
user-defined elements.
  This paper describes a variety of use cases taken from real-world scenarios
that present features seldom considered in classical CEP problems. It also
provides a broad review of current solutions, that includes tools and
techniques going beyond typical surveys on CEP. From a critical analysis of
these solutions, design principles for a new type of event stream processing
system are exposed. The paper proposes a simple, generic and extensible
framework for the processing of event streams of diverse types; it describes in
detail a stream processing engine, called BeepBeep, that implements these
principles. BeepBeep's modular architecture, which borrows concepts from many
other systems, is complemented with an extensible query language, called eSQL.
The end result is an open, versatile, and reasonably efficient query engine
that can be used in situations that go beyond the capabilities of existing
systems.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1609.03260",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we aim to obtain the optimal delay-power tradeoff and the
corresponding optimal scheduling policy for an arbitrary i.i.d. arrival process
and adaptive transmissions. The number of backlogged packets at the transmitter
is known to a scheduler, who has to determine how many backlogged packets to
transmit during each time slot. The power consumption is assumed to be convex
in transmission rates. Hence, if the scheduler transmits faster, the delay will
be reduced but with higher power consumption. To obtain the optimal delay-power
tradeoff and the corresponding optimal policy, we model the problem as a
Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where we minimize the average delay
given an average power constraint. By steady-state analysis and Lagrangian
relaxation, we can show that the optimal tradeoff curve is decreasing, convex,
and piecewise linear, and the optimal policy is threshold-based. Based on the
revealed properties of the optimal policy, we develop an algorithm to
efficiently obtain the optimal tradeoff curve and the optimal policy with full
information of the system. The complexity of our proposed algorithm is much
lower than a general algorithm based on Linear Programming. However, usually
the distribution of the arrival process is unknown to the scheduler, therefore
we proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently obtain the
optimal policy under this circumstance. We also analyse in details about how
the system parameters affect the optimal policy and the system performance. In
the final, we use simulations to validate the derived results and the proposed
algorithms.

device-to-device (D2D) communications as a promising technology for future
cellular systems, plays crucial rule. The key factor in D2D communication is
providing efficient peer discovery mechanisms in ultra dense networks. In this
paper, we propose a centralized D2D discovery scheme by employing a signaling
algorithm to exchange D2D discovery messages between network entities. In this
system, potential D2D pairs share uplink cellular users' resources with

analyze system performance in terms of success probability of the transmitted

  Convergence Rate",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a general stochastic resource allocation problem that
arises widely in wireless networks, cognitive radio, networks, smart-grid
communications, and cross-layer design. The problem formulation involves
expectations with respect to a collection of random variables with unknown
distributions, representing exogenous quantities such as channel gain, user
density, or spectrum occupancy. We consider the constant step-size stochastic
dual subgradient descent (SDSD) method that has been widely used for online
resource allocation in networks. The problem is solved in dual domain which
results in a primal resource allocation subproblem at each time instant. The
goal here is to characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of such stochastic
resource allocations in an almost sure sense.
  It is well known that with a step size of $\epsilon$, {SDSD} converges to an
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-sized neighborhood of the optimum. In practice however,
there exists a trade-off between the rate of convergence and the choice of
$\epsilon$. This paper establishes a convergence rate result for the SDSD
algorithm that precisely characterizes this trade-off. {Towards this end, a
novel stochastic bound on the gap between the objective function and the
optimum is developed. The asymptotic behavior of the stochastic term is
characterized in an almost sure sense, thereby generalizing the existing
results for the {stochastic subgradient} methods.} For the stochastic resource
allocation problem at hand, the result explicates the rate with which the
allocated resources become near-optimal. As an application, the power and
user-allocation problem in device-to-device networks is formulated and solved
using the {SDSD} algorithm. Further intuition on the rate results is obtained
from the verification of the regularity conditions and accompanying simulation
results.

sources exhibiting low-order correlations, 1-sided model-based conditional

certain quantity with respect to a probability measure {\mu} on the level set

A specially interesting case is the so-called conditional probability measure,
which is useful in the study of free energy calculation and model reduction of
diffusion processes. By Birkhoff's ergodic theorem, one approach to estimate
the mean value is to compute the time average along an infinitely long
trajectory of an ergodic diffusion process on the level set whose invariant

the conditional measure, in particular, we show that the corresponding SDEs of
the constructed ergodic processes have relatively simple forms, and, moreover,
we propose a consistent numerical scheme which samples the conditional measure

comprehensive view of the accretion and evaporation histories of PBHs across
the entire cosmic history is presented, with focus on the critical mass holes.
The critical mass of a PBH for current era evaporation is $M_{cr}\sim
5.1\times10^{14}$ g. Across cosmic time such a black hole will not accrete
radiation or matter in sufficient quantity to hasten the inevitable
evaporation, if the black hole remains within an average volume of the
universe. The accretion rate onto PBHs is most sensitive to the mass of the
hole, the sound speed in the cosmological fluid, and the energy density of the
accreted components. It is not easy for a PBH to accrete the average
cosmological fluid to reach $30M_\odot$ by $z\sim0.1$, the approximate mass and
redshift of the merging BHs that were the sources of the gravitational wave
events GW150914 and GW151226. A PBH located in an overdense region can undergo
enhanced accretion leading to the possibility of growing by many orders of
magnitude across cosmic history. Thus, two merging PBHs are a plausible source
for the observed gravitational wave events. However, it is difficult for
isolated PBHs to grow to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift with
masses large enough to fit observational constraints.

SABR model is driven by the exponentiation of a correlated fractional Brownian

motions, probability density for such a model is less studied in the

of the lognormal fractional SABR model in a Fourier space. Evaluating the
bridge representation along a properly chosen deterministic path yields a small
time asymptotic expansion to the leading order for the probability density of
the fractional SABR model. A direct generalization of the representation to
joint density at multiple times leads to a heuristic derivation of the large

develop this work based on a dataset of WeChat, one of the most extensively

unsupervised approach to classify the images posted by users. Based on the
classification result, we construct three types of user-level features that
reflect user preference, activity and posting habit. Based on these features,
for a series of selfie related tasks, we build classifiers that can accurately
predict two sets of users with opposite selfie-posting behaviours. We have
found that people's interest, activity and posting habit have a great influence
on their selfie-posting behaviours. For example, the classification accuracy
between selfie-posting addict and nonaddict reaches 89.36%. We also prove that
using user's image information to predict these behaviours achieve better
performance than using text information. More importantly, for each set of
users with a specific selfie-posting behaviour, we extract and visualize
significant personal patterns about them. In addition, we cluster users and
extract their high-level attributes, revealing the correlation between these
attributes and users' selfie-posting behaviours. In the end, we demonstrate
that users' selfie-posting behaviour, as a good predictor, could predict their

its performance is analyzed for the single-input single-output (SISO) and
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) point-to-point channel as well as the
multiple-access channel (MAC), with channel state information available only at
the receiver (CSIR). At the decoder a novel strategy is proposed consisting of
a time-varying equalization matrix followed by decision regions that depend
only on channel statistics, not individual realizations. Our encoder has a
similar structure to that of Erez and Zamir. For the SISO channel, the gap to
capacity is bounded by a constant under a wide range of fading distributions.
For the MIMO channel under Rayleigh fading, the rate achieved is within a gap
to capacity that does not depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and
diminishes with the number of receive antennas. The analysis is extended to the
K-user MAC where similar results hold. Achieving a small gap to capacity while
limiting the use of CSIR to the equalizer highlights the scope for efficient
decoder implementations, since decision regions are fixed, i.e., independent of

for photonics because they combine well defined tunable direct band gaps and
selfpassivated surfaces without dangling bonds. However, the atomic thickness
of these 2D materials results in low photo absorption limiting the achievable
photo luminescence intensity. Such emission can, in principle, be enhanced via
nanoscale antennae resulting in; a. an increased absorption cross-section
enhancing pump efficiency, b. an acceleration of the internal emission rate via
the Purcell factor mainly by reducing the antennas optical mode volume beyond
the diffraction limit, and c. improved impedance matching of the emitter dipole
to the freespace wavelength. Plasmonic dimer antennae show orders of magnitude
hot-spot field enhancements when an emitter is positioned exactly at the
midgap. However, a 2D material cannot be grown, or easily transferred, to
reside in mid-gap of the metallic dimer cavity. In addition, a spacer layer
between the cavity and the emissive material is required to avoid non-radiative
recombination channels. Using both computational and experimental methods, in
this work we show that the emission enhancement from a 2D emitter- monomer
antenna cavity system rivals that of dimers at much reduced lithographic
effort. We rationalize this finding by showing that the emission enhancement in
dimer antennae does not specifically originate from the gap of the dimer
cavity, but is an average effect originating from the effective cavity
crosssection taken below each optical cavity where the emitting 2D film is
located. In particular, we test an array of different dimer and monomer antenna
geometries and observe a representative 3x higher emission for both monomer and
dimer cavities as compared to intrinsic emission of Chemical Vapor Deposition

  If $R$ is prime radical and $\delta$ is a derivation of $R$, then the
differential polynomial ring $R[X;\delta]$ is locally nilpotent. This answers
an open question posed in by Nielsen and Ziembowski.
  The nil radical of a differential polynomial ring $R[X;\delta]$ takes the
form $I[X;\delta]$ for some ideal $I$ of $R$, provided that the base field is
infinite. This answers an open question posed by Hong, Kim, Lee and Nielsen for
algebras over infinite fields.
  If $R$ is a graded algebra generated in degree $1$ over a field of
characteristic zero and $\delta$ is a grading preserving derivation on $R$,
then the Jacobson radical of $R$ is $\delta$-stable. Examples are given to show
the necessity of all conditions, thereby proving this result is sharp.
  Skew polynomial rings with natural grading are locally nilpotent if and only
if they are graded locally nilpotent.
  The power series ring $R[[X;\sigma,\delta]]$ is well-defined whenever
$\delta$ is a locally nilpotent $\sigma$-derivation; this answers a conjecture
by Bergen and Grzeszczuk and opens up the possibility of generalizing many
research directions studied thus far only when further restrictions are put on

between different qubits. We found that our method transforms the qubit layout
and reduces the number of qubits that cannot be accessed two-dimensionally. We
show that fully 2D layouts including both qubits and control electrodes can be
achieved for surface and color codes of minimum sizes. This method will be
beneficial to simplifications of fabrication process of quantum circuits in

a multilevel, low communications, non-iterative, domain decomposition algorithm
for the numerical solution of the free space Poisson's equation in 3D on
locally-structured grids. In this method, the field is computed as a linear
superposition of local fields induced by charges on rectangular patches of size
$O(1)$ mesh points, with the global coupling represented by a coarse grid
solution using a right-hand side computed from the local solutions. In the
present method, the local convolutions are further decomposed into a
short-range contribution computed by convolution with the discrete Green's
function for an $Q^{th}$-order accurate finite difference approximation to the
Laplacian with the full right-hand side on the patch, combined with a
longer-range component that is the field induced by the terms up to order $P-1$
of the Legendre expansion of the charge over the patch. This leads to a method
with a solution error that has an asymptotic bound of $O(h^P) + O(h^Q) +
O(\epsilon h^2) + O(\epsilon)$, where $h$ is the mesh spacing, and $\epsilon$
is the max norm of the charge times a rapidly-decaying function of the radius
of the support of the local solutions scaled by $h$. Thus we have eliminated
the low-order accuracy of the original method (which corresponds to $P=1$ in
the present method) for smooth solutions, while keeping the computational cost
per patch nearly the same with that of the original method. Specifically, in
addition to the local solves of the original method we only have to compute and
communicate the expansion coefficients of local expansions (that is, for
instance, 20 scalars per patch for $P=4$). Several numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the new method and demonstrate its convergence
properties.

two tilting DSLR cameras centred on the plant. This uses new methods of camera

We assessed the system's accuracy using a 3D visual hull reconstruction
algorithm applied on 2 plastic models of dicotyledonous plants, 2 sorghum
plants and 2 wheat plants across different sets of tilt angles. Scan times
ranged from 3 minutes (to capture 72 images using 2 tilt angles), to 30 minutes
(to capture 360 images using 10 tilt angles). The leaf lengths, widths, areas
and perimeters of the plastic models were measured manually and compared to
measurements from the scanning system: results were within 3-4% of each other.
The 3D reconstructions obtained with the scanning system show excellent
geometric agreement with all six plant specimens, even plants with thin leaves

pathway? How far should we take computational models of vision with the same
visual ability to detect illusions as we do? This study addresses these
questions, by focusing on a specific underlying neural mechanism involved in
our visual experiences that affects our final perception. Among many types of
visual illusion, Geometrical and, in particular, Tilt Illusions are rather
important, being characterized by misperception of geometric patterns involving
lines and tiles in combination with contrasting orientation, size or position.
Over the last decade, many new neurophysiological experiments have led to new
insights as to how, when and where retinal processing takes place, and the
encoding nature of the retinal representation that is sent to the cortex for
further processing. Based on these neurobiological discoveries, we provide
computer simulation evidence from modelling retinal ganglion cells responses to
some complex Tilt Illusions, suggesting that the emergence of tilt in these
illusions is partially related to the interaction of multiscale visual
processing performed in the retina. The output of our low-level filtering model
is presented for several types of Tilt Illusion, predicting that the final tilt
percept arises from multiple-scale processing of the Differences of Gaussians
and the perceptual interaction of foreground and background elements. Our
results suggest that this model has a high potential in revealing the
underlying mechanism connecting low-level filtering approaches to mid- and
high-level explanations such as Anchoring theory and Perceptual grouping.

""Magnetically-Regulated,"" i.e., fixed efficiency per free-fall time in regions
that are magnetically supercritical. Variations of parameters associated with

level of star formation is sensitive to model parameter choices that relate to
effective density thresholds. In the GMC collision simulations, the final star
formation rates and efficiencies are relatively independent of these
parameters. Between non-colliding and colliding cases, we compare the
morphologies of the resulting star clusters, properties of star-forming gas,
time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), spatial clustering of the
stars, and resulting kinematics of the stars in comparison to the natal gas. We

vehicles via millimeter-wave (mmWave) microcellular networks. This paper uses
stochastic geometry to analyze the coverage of urban mmWave microcellular
networks. Prior work used a pathloss model with a line-of-sight probability
function based on randomly oriented buildings, to determine whether a link was
line-of-sight or non-line-of-sight. In this paper, we use a pathloss model
inspired by measurements, which uses a Manhattan distance pathloss model and
accounts for differences in pathloss exponents and losses when turning corners.
In our model, streets are randomly located as a Manhattan Poisson line process
(MPLP) and the base stations (BSs) are distributed according to a Poisson point
process. Our model is well suited for urban microcellular networks where the
BSs are deployed at street level. Based on this new approach, we derive the
coverage probability under certain BS association rules to obtain closed-form
solutions without much complexity. In addition, we draw two main conclusions
from our work. First, non-line-of-sight BSs are not a major benefit for
association or source of interference most of the time. Second, there is an
ultra-dense regime where deploying active BSs does not enhance coverage.

The proposed channel estimation algorithm aims to estimate the strongest
angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) at both the base station (BS) and the users. Then all
the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the BS via these estimated
strongest AoAs to facilitate the channel estimation. The algorithm does not
require any explicit channel state information (CSI) feedback from the users
and the associated signalling overhead of the algorithm is only proportional to
the number of users, which is significantly less compared to various existing
schemes. Besides, the proposed algorithm is applicable to both non-sparse and
sparse mmWave channel environments. Based on the estimated CSI, zero-forcing
(ZF) precoding is adopted for multiuser downlink transmission. In addition, we
derive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the system. Our analytical and
simulation results show that the proposed scheme offer a considerable
achievable rate gain compared to fully digital systems, where the number of RF
chains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas.
Furthermore, the achievable rate performance gap between the considered hybrid

interest for both agricultural and public health reasons. The standard method
to assess the water quality of a catchment, or a group of catchments, usually
involves collecting point measurements of water quality and other additional
information such as the date and time of measurements, rainfall amounts, the
land-use and soil-type of the catchment and the elevation. Some of this
auxiliary information will be point data, measured at the exact location,
whereas other such as land-use will be areal data often in a compositional
format. Two problems arise if analysts try to incorporate this information into
a statistical model in order to predict (for example) the influence of land-use
on water quality. First is the spatial change of support problem that arises
when using areal data to predict outcomes at point locations. Secondly, the
physical process driving water quality is not compositional, rather it is the
observation process that provides compositional data. In this paper we present
an approach that accounts for these two issues by using a latent variable to
identify the land-use that most likely influences water quality. This latent
variable is used in a spatial mixture model to help estimate the influence of
land-use on water quality. We demonstrate the potential of this approach with
data from a water quality research study in the Mount Lofty range, in South
Australia.

with Y = (Ni, Fe, Pt) where, in both cases, Z = (Al, Ga, Ge, In, Sn). We find
that for the Co$_2$NiZ, Co$_2$PtZ, and Fe$_2$PtZ families the cubic phase is
always, at $T=0$, unstable with respect to a tetragonal distortion, while, in
contrast, for the Fe$_2$NiZ and Fe$_2$CoZ families this is the case for only 2
compounds -- Fe$_2$CoGe and Fe$_2$CoSn. For all compounds in which a tetragonal
distortion occurs we calculate the MAE finding remarkably large values for the
Pt containing Heuslers, but also large values for a number of the other
compounds (e.g. Co$_2$NiGa has an MAE of -2.11~MJ/m$^3$). The tendency to a
tetragonal distortion we find to be strongly correlated with a high density of
states at the Fermi level in the cubic phase. As a corollary to this fact we
observe that upon doping compounds for which the cubic structure is stable such
that the Fermi level enters a region of high DOS, a tetragonal distortion is
induced and a correspondingly large value of the MAE is then observed.

which is {\em polynomially} smaller than the existing sharpest one. We also
propose upper bounds on the lengths of the columns of KZ reduced matrices, and
an upper bound on the orthogonality defect of KZ reduced matrices which are
even {\em polynomially and exponentially} smaller than those of boosted KZ
reduced matrices, respectively. Then, we derive upper bounds on the magnitudes
of the entries of any solution of a shortest vector problem (SVP) when its
basis matrix is LLL reduced. These upper bounds are useful for analyzing the
complexity and understanding numerical stability of the basis expansion in a KZ

modifying the commonly used Schnorr-Euchner search strategy for solving SVPs

  Storage in the Cloud","14 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MSST2017",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Eliminating duplicate data in primary storage of clouds increases the
cost-efficiency of cloud service providers as well as reduces the cost of users
for using cloud services. Existing primary deduplication techniques either use
inline caching to exploit locality in primary workloads or use post-processing
deduplication running in system idle time to avoid the negative impact on I/O
performance. However, neither of them works well in the cloud servers running
multiple services or applications for the following two reasons: Firstly, the
temporal locality of duplicate data writes may not exist in some primary
storage workloads thus inline caching often fails to achieve good deduplication
ratio. Secondly, the post-processing deduplication allows duplicate data to be
written into disks, therefore does not provide the benefit of I/O deduplication
and requires high peak storage capacity. This paper presents HPDedup, a Hybrid
Prioritized data Deduplication mechanism to deal with the storage system shared
by applications running in co-located virtual machines or containers by fusing
an inline and a post-processing process for exact deduplication. In the inline
deduplication phase, HPDedup gives a fingerprint caching mechanism that
estimates the temporal locality of duplicates in data streams from different
VMs or applications and prioritizes the cache allocation for these streams
based on the estimation. HPDedup also allows different deduplication threshold
for streams based on their spatial locality to reduce the disk fragmentation.
The post-processing phase removes duplicates whose fingerprints are not able to
be cached due to the weak temporal locality from disks. Our experimental
results show that HPDedup clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art primary
storage deduplication techniques in terms of inline cache efficiency and
primary deduplication efficiency.

images. However, most analysis is constrained to the millimeter scale because
of the limited resolution of clinical computed tomography (CT). X-ray
microtomography ($\mu$CT) on the other hand allows imaging of ex-vivo tissues
at a resolution of tens of microns. In this work, we use clinical CT to image
lung cancer patients before partial pneumonectomy (resection of pathological
lung tissue). The resected specimen is prepared for $\mu$CT imaging at a voxel
resolution of 50 $\mu$m (0.05 mm). This high-resolution image of the lung
cancer tissue allows further insides into understanding of tumor growth and
categorization. For making full use of this additional information, image
fusion (registration) needs to be performed in order to re-align the $\mu$CT
image with clinical CT. We developed a multi-scale non-rigid registration
approach. After manual initialization using a few landmark points and rigid
alignment, several levels of non-rigid registration between down-sampled (in
the case of $\mu$CT) and up-sampled (in the case of clinical CT)
representations of the image are performed. Any non-lung tissue is ignored
during the computation of the similarity measure used to guide the registration
during optimization. We are able to recover the volume differences introduced
by the resection and preparation of the lung specimen. The average ($\pm$ std.
dev.) minimum surface distance between $\mu$CT and clinical CT at the resected
lung surface is reduced from 3.3 $\pm$ 2.9 (range: [0.1, 15.9]) to 2.3 mm $\pm$
2.8 (range: [0.0, 15.3]) mm. The alignment of clinical CT with $\mu$CT will
allow further registration with even finer resolutions of $\mu$CT (up to 10
$\mu$m resolution) and ultimately with histopathological microscopy images for
further macro to micro image fusion that can aid medical image analysis.

in any matroid: Let $S$ be a sequence of non-loops in a matroid $M$ of finite
rank $m$ with closure operator cl. Suppose that $S$ is colored in such a way
that the first color does not appear more than $r$-times and each other color
appears at most $(r-1)$-times. Then $S$ can be partitioned into $r$ rainbow
subsequences $S_1,\ldots, S_r$ such that $cl\,\emptyset\subsetneq

$\emptyset\neq \bigcap_{i=1}^r cl\,S_i$. A subsequence is called rainbow if it
contains each color at most once.
  The conclusion of our theorem is weaker than the conclusion of the original
Tverberg's theorem in $\mathbb R^d$, which states that $\bigcap conv\,S_i\neq
\emptyset$, whereas we only claim that $\bigcap aff\,S_i\neq \emptyset$. On the
other hand, our theorem strengthens the Tverberg's theorem in several other
ways: 1) it is applicable to any matroid (whereas Tverberg's theorem can only
be used in $\mathbb R^d$), 2) instead of $\bigcap cl\,S_i\neq \emptyset$ we
have the stronger condition $cl\,\emptyset\subsetneq cl\,S_1\subseteq

that are even stronger than the color constraints in the colorful version of
Tverberg's theorem.

across servers and the herd behaviors, an adaptive replica selection scheme C3
is proposed recently. In C3, feedback from individual servers is brought into
replica ranking to reflect the time-varying performance of servers, and the
distributed rate control and backpressure mechanism is invented. Despite of
C3's good performance, we reveal the timeliness issue of C3, which has large
impacts on both the replica ranking and the rate control, and propose the Tars
(timeliness-aware adaptive replica selection) scheme. Following the same

the feedback information into consideration, as well as revises the rate
control of C3. Simulation results confirm that Tars outperforms C3.

quenched approximation. In contrast, if we use the topological charge density
as field operators for the pseudoscalar, the masses of the lowest state are
much lighter (around 1GeV) and compatible with the expected masses of the
flavor singlet $q\bar{q}$ meson. This indicates that the operator
$\epsilon_{ijk}TrB_iD_jB_k$ and the topological charge density couple rather
differently to the glueball states and $q\bar{q}$ mesons. The observation of
the light flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson can be viewed as the manifestation
of effects of dynamical quarks. In the scalar channel, the ground state masses
extracted from the correlation functions of gluonic operators are determined to
be around 1.4-1.5 GeV, which is close to the ground state masses from the
correlation functions of the quark bilinear operators. In all cases, the mixing

spline functions (on an interval) and the DBO. It is shown in particular that
the (scaled) fourth-order distributional derivative of the cubic spline is
identical to the action of the DBO on grid functions. The DBO is constructed in
terms of the discrete Hermitian derivative. A remarkable fact is that the
kernel of the inverse of the discrete operator is (up to scaling) equal to the
grid evaluation of the kernel of $\Big[\Big(\frac{d}{dx}\Big)^4\Big]^{-1} .$
Explicit expressions are presented for both kernels. The relation between the
(infinite) set of eigenvalues of the fourth-order Sturm-Liouville problem and
the finite set of eigenvalues of the discrete biharmonic operator is studied,
and the discrete eigenvalues are proved to converge (at an ""optimal"" $O(h^4)$
rate) to the continuous ones. Another remarkable consequence is the validity of
a comparison principle. It is well known that there is no maximum principle for
the fourth-order equation. However, a positivity result is derived, both for
the continuous and the discrete biharmonic equation, showing that in both cases
the kernels are order preserving.

that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class
classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only
predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated
as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two
networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from
background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the
foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with
coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of
the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As
network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch
normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with
dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of
the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures
label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7 million parameters in the
network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that
DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely
learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young,
old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small
training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger
datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in
the future.

has been placed at the GaN/ AlxGa1-xN (AlxGa1-xN /air) interface in AlxGa1-xN
region in axial (radial) directions. To obtain energy levels and related
wavefunctions, self-consistent procedure has been employed to solve
Schrodinger-Poisson equations with considering the spontaneous and
piezoelectric polarization. Then luminescence spectrum is studied in details to
recognize the parameters influent in luminescence. The results show that the
amount of doping, size of QDiscs and theirs numbers have remarkable effects on
the band to band luminescence emission. Our numerical calculations gives some
insights into the luminescence emission of core/shell nanowire and exhibits a
useful tool to analyze findings in experiments.

measure suppresses epidemics in networks. A simple and ideal quarantine measure
is considered in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately
after it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly
isolated. The efficiency of this quarantine in suppressing a
susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is tested in random graphs and
uncorrelated scale-free networks. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that
the prompt quarantine measure outperforms random and acquaintance preventive
vaccination schemes in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals.
The epidemic threshold for the SIR model is analytically derived under the
quarantine measure, and the theoretical findings indicate that prompt
executions of quarantines are highly effective in containing epidemics. Even if
infected individuals are detected with a very low probability, the SIR model
under a prompt quarantine measure has finite epidemic thresholds in fat-tailed
scale-free networks in which an infected individual can always cause an
outbreak of a finite relative size without any measure. The numerical
simulations also demonstrate that the present quarantine measure is effective
in suppressing epidemics in real networks.

weighted tree search instance is known to be strongly NP-hard, in contrast to
the unweighted variant of the problem which can be solved optimally in linear
time. Here, we show that weighted tree search admits a quasi-polynomial time
approximation scheme: for any $0 \textless{} \varepsilon \textless{} 1$, there
exists a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation strategy with a computation time of
$n^{O(\log n / \varepsilon^2)}$. Thus, the problem is not APX-hard, unless $NP

a corollary that the studied problem admits a polynomial-time $O(\sqrt{\log

specifically, we treat the assignment of an article to the different clustering
solutions as an additional element of its bibliographic record. Keeping the
principle of semantic indexing on the level of such an extended list of
entities of the bibliographic record, LittleAriadne in turn provides a
visualization of the context of a specific clustering solution. It also conveys
the similarity of article clusters produced by different algorithms, hence
representing a complementary approach to other possible means of comparison.

motion prediction for up to 1660 ms. Additionally, we demonstrate online target

the possibility to draw samples of possible future motions. Finally, we
investigate how movements and kinematic cues are represented on the learned low

ecosystems of 3rd party apps that are designed to work with users' cloud files.
Such apps often request full access to users' files, including files shared
with collaborators. Hence, whenever a user grants access to a new vendor, she
is inflicting a privacy loss on herself and on her collaborators too. Based on
analyzing a real dataset of 183 Google Drive users and 131 third party apps, we
discover that collaborators inflict a privacy loss which is at least 39% higher
than what users themselves cause. We take a step toward minimizing this loss by
introducing the concept of History-based decisions. Simply put, users are
informed at decision time about the vendors which have been previously granted
access to their data. Thus, they can reduce their privacy loss by not
installing apps from new vendors whenever possible. Next, we realize this
concept by introducing a new privacy indicator, which can be integrated within
the cloud apps' authorization interface. Via a web experiment with 141
participants recruited from CrowdFlower, we show that our privacy indicator can
significantly increase the user's likelihood of choosing the app that minimizes
her privacy loss. Finally, we explore the network effect of History-based
decisions via a simulation on top of large collaboration networks. We
demonstrate that adopting such a decision-making process is capable of reducing
the growth of users' privacy loss by 70% in a Google Drive-based network and by
40% in an author collaboration network. This is despite the fact that we
neither assume that users cooperate nor that they exhibit altruistic behavior.
To our knowledge, our work is the first to provide quantifiable evidence of the
privacy risk that collaborators pose in cloud apps. We are also the first to
mitigate this problem via a usable privacy approach.

attractive but challenging goals in the field. We present a methodology of a
systematic search for exoplanetary rings via transit photometry of long-period
planets. The methodology relies on a precise integration scheme we develop to
compute a transit light curve of a ringed planet. We apply the methodology to
89 long-period planet candidates from the Kepler data so as to estimate, and/or
set upper limits on, the parameters of possible rings. While a majority of our
samples do not have a sufficiently good signal-to-noise ratio for meaningful
constraints on ring parameters, we find that six systems with a higher
signal-to-noise ratio are inconsistent with the presence of a ring larger than
1.5 times the planetary radius assuming a grazing orbit and a tilted ring.
Furthermore, we identify five preliminary candidate systems whose light curves
exhibit ring-like features. After removing four false positives due to the
contamination from nearby stars, we identify KIC 10403228 as a reasonable
candidate for a ringed planet. A systematic parameter fit of its light curve
with a ringed planet model indicates two possible solutions corresponding to a
Saturn-like planet with a tilted ring. There also remain other two possible
scenarios accounting for the data; a circumstellar disk and a hierarchical
triple. Due to large uncertain factors, we cannot choose one specific model
among the three.

QRES proofs of QBFs in prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF) as a byproduct of
the solving process. In contrast to traditional QCDCL based on QRES, DepQBF 6.0
implements a variant of QCDCL which is based on a generalization of QRES. This
generalization is due to a set of additional axioms and leaves the original
Q-resolution rules unchanged. The generalization of QRES enables QCDCL to
potentially produce exponentially shorter proofs than the traditional variant.
We present an overview of the features implemented in DepQBF and report on
experimental results which demonstrate the effectiveness of generalized QRES in
QCDCL.

therefore very quickly and with high efficiency. We then consider the

our insights on the relationship between the probability of prediction and the

help mispredictions for inputs predicted with a high probability even when
there is a non-negligible number of mispredicted inputs. This finding motivated
us to develop a way to adaptively control the ensembling. If the prediction for
an input reaches a high enough probability, i.e., the output from the softmax
function, on the basis of the confidence level, we stop ensembling for this
input to avoid wasting computation power. We evaluated the adaptive ensembling
by using various datasets and showed that it reduces the computation cost
significantly while achieving accuracy similar to that of static ensembling
using a pre-defined number of local predictions. We also show that our
statistically rigorous confidence-level-based early-exit condition reduces the
burden of task-dependent threshold tuning better compared with naive early exit
based on a pre-defined threshold in addition to yielding a better accuracy with

system of interacting fermions described by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a
space bounded by cylindrical surface of finite radius. In order to confine the
fermions inside the cylinder we impose ""chiral"" MIT boundary conditions on its
surface. These boundary conditions are parameterized by a continuous chiral
angle \Theta. We find that at any value of \Theta the chiral restoration
temperature T_c decreases as a quadratic function of the angular frequency
\Omega. However, the position and the slope of the critical curve T_c =
T_c(\Omega) in the phase diagram depends noticeably on the value of the chiral
angle.

remains between the rapidly growing structural data on the chromosome folding
and the large-scale genome organization. Could a part of information on the
chromosome folding be obtained directly from underlying genomic DNA sequences
abundantly stored in the databanks? To answer this question, we developed an
original discrete double Fourier transform (DDFT). DDFT serves for the
detection of large-scale genome regularities associated with domains/units at
the different levels of hierarchical chromosome folding. The method is
versatile and can be applied to both genomic DNA sequences and corresponding
physico-chemical parameters such as base-pairing free energy. The latter
characteristic is closely related to the replication and transcription and can
also be used for the assessment of temperature or supercoiling effects on the
chromosome folding. We tested the method on the genome of Escherichia coli K-12
and found good correspondence with the annotated domains/units established
experimentally. As a brief illustration of further abilities of DDFT, the study
of large-scale genome organization for bacteriophage PHIX174 and bacterium
Caulobacter crescentus was also added. The combined experimental, modeling, and
bioinformatic DDFT analysis should yield more complete knowledge on the
chromosome architecture and genome organization.

However, the simultaneous requirements of perturbative unitarity, and also
compatibility with collider and flavour data, constrain the parameter space
severely. We investigate the collider signals answering to the regions allowed
by such constraints. In particular, the near degeneracy of the neutral heavy
scalar and the pseudoscalar is a feature that is probed. The LHC allows
distinguishability of these two states, together with signal significance of at
least 3$\sigma$, in its high-luminosity run. While $e^+ e^-$ colliders may have
rather low event rates, muon colliders, cashing on the principle of radiative

broad peaks in the primordial curvature power spectrum that collapse
gravitationally during the radiation era, to form clusters of black holes that
merge and increase in mass after recombination, generating today a broad
mass-spectrum of black holes with masses ranging from 0.01 to $10^5~M_\odot$.
These MPBH could act as seeds for galaxies and quick-start structure formation,
initiating reionization, forming galaxies at redshift $z>10$ and clusters at
$z>1$. They may also be the seeds on which SMBH and IMBH form, by accreting gas
onto them and forming the centers of galaxies and quasars at high redshift.
They form at rest with zero spin and have negligible cross-section with
ordinary matter. If there are enough of these MPBH, they could constitute the
bulk of the Dark Matter today. Such PBH could be responsible for the observed
fluctuations in the CIB and X-ray backgrounds. MPBH could be directly detected
by the gravitational waves emitted when they merge to form more massive black
holes, as recently reported by LIGO. Their continuous merging since
recombination could have generated a stochastic background of gravitational
waves that could eventually be detected by LISA and PTA. MPBH may actually be
responsible for the unidentified point sources seen by Fermi, Magic and
Chandra. Furthermore, the ejection of stars from shallow potential wells like
those of Dwarf Spheroidals (DSph), via the gravitational slingshot effect,
could be due to MPBH, thus alleviating the substructure and too-big-to-fail
problems of standard collisionless CDM. Their mass distribution peaks at a few
tens of $M_\odot$ today, and could be detected also with long-duration
microlensing events, as well as by the anomalous motion of stars in GAIA. Their
presence as CDM in the Universe could be seen in the time-dilation of lensed
images of quasars.

solvophilic and also ones that have both solvophobic and solvophilic patches.
Large values of $\chi({\mathbf r})$ correspond to regions in space where the
liquid density is fluctuating most strongly. We seek to elucidate how enhanced
density fluctuations correlate with the solvent mediated force between the
blocks, as the distance between the blocks and the chemical potential of the
liquid reservoir vary. For sufficiently solvophobic blocks, at small block
separations and small deviations from bulk gas-liquid coexistence, we observe a
strongly attractive (near constant) force, stemming from capillary evaporation
to form a low density gas-like intrusion between the blocks. The accompanying
$\chi({\mathbf r})$ exhibits structure which reflects the incipient gas-liquid
interfaces that develop. We argue that our model system provides a means to
understanding the basic physics of solvent mediated interactions between
nanostructures, and between objects such as proteins in water, that possess
hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches.

observation scan of the inner Milky Way in the TeV gamma-ray band to date. The
sky maps and source catalogue of the HGPS allow for a systematic study of the
population of TeV pulsar wind nebulae found throughout the last decade. To
investigate the nature and evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, for the first time
we also present several upper limits for regions around pulsars without a
detected TeV wind nebula. Our data exhibit a correlation of TeV surface
brightness with pulsar spin-down power $\dot{E}$. This seems to be caused both
by an increase of extension with decreasing $\dot{E}$, and hence with time,
compatible with a power law $R_\mathrm{PWN}(\dot{E}) \sim \dot{E}^{-0.65 \pm
0.20}$, and by a mild decrease of TeV gamma-ray luminosity with decreasing
$\dot{E}$, compatible with $L_{1-10\,\mathrm{TeV}} \sim \dot{E}^{0.59 \pm
0.21}$. We also find that the offsets of pulsars with respect to the wind
nebula centres with ages around 10 kyr are frequently larger than can be
plausibly explained by pulsar proper motion and could be due to an asymmetric
environment. In the present data, it seems that a large pulsar offset is
correlated with a high apparent TeV efficiency
$L_{1-10\,\mathrm{TeV}}/\dot{E}$. In addition to 14 HGPS sources considered as
firmly identified pulsar wind nebulae and 5 additional pulsar wind nebulae
taken from literature, we find 10 HGPS sources that form likely TeV pulsar wind
nebula candidates. Using a model that subsumes the present common understanding
of the very high-energy radiative evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, we find
that the trends and variations of the TeV observables and limits can be
reproduced to a good level, drawing a consistent picture of present-day TeV
data and theory.

of training samples relates proportionally to the efforts required from the
subject. However, a repetition of a movement is the atomic unit for subjects
and the total number of repetitions should therefore be used as reliable
measure for training efforts. Also when correcting for this mistake, we do not
find any performance increase due to the use of prior models.

  Application to Kidney Exchange",,,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation is a classical
economic and computational problem. The price of fairness measures the
worst-case loss of economic efficiency when using an inefficient but fair
allocation rule; for indivisible goods in many settings, this price is
unacceptably high. One such setting is kidney exchange, where needy patients
swap willing but incompatible kidney donors. In this work, we close an open
problem regarding the theoretical price of fairness in modern kidney exchanges.
We then propose a general hybrid fairness rule that balances a strict
lexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents, and a utilitarian
objective that maximizes economic efficiency. We develop a utility function for
this rule that favors disadvantaged groups lexicographically; but if cost to
overall efficiency becomes too high, it switches to a utilitarian objective.
This rule has only one parameter which is proportional to a bound on the price
of fairness, and can be adjusted by policymakers. We apply this rule to real
data from a large kidney exchange and show that our hybrid rule produces more
reliable outcomes than other fairness rules.

The Web provides an infrastructure to help us to learn, to work, to communicate

environment affected by the digital divide between those who have and those who
do not have access. Additionally, the Web provides challenges we must
understand if we are to find a viable balance between data ownership and
privacy protection, between over-whelming surveillance and the prevention of
terrorism. For the Web to succeed, we need to understand its societal
challenges including increased crime, the impact of social platforms and
socio-economic discrimination, and we must work towards fairness, social
inclusion, and open governance.
  Ten Yars ago, the field of Web Science was created to explore the science
underlying the Web from a socio-technical perspective including its
mathematical properties, engineering principles, and social impacts. Ten years
later, we are learning much as the interdisciplinary endeavor to understand the
Web's global information space continues to grow.

[Astrophys. J. 548, L87] based on the measurements of differential rotation
with altitude as a function of observing frequencies (as lower and higher
frequencies indicate higher and lower heights, respectively) in the solar
corona. The radial differential rotation of the solar corona is estimated from
daily measurements of the disc-integrated solar radio flux at 11 frequencies:
(275, 405, 670, 810, 925, 1080, 1215, 1350, 1620, 1755 MHz and 2800 MHz). We
use the same data as were used in Vats et al. (2001), but instead of the 12th
maxima of autocorrelograms used there, we use the 1st secondary maxima to
derive the synodic rotation period. We estimate synodic rotation by Gaussian
fit of the 1st secondary maxima. Vats et al. (2001) reported that the sidereal
rotation period increases with increasing frequency. The variation found by
them was from 23.6 to 24.15 days in this frequency range with a difference of
only 0.55 days. The present study finds that sidereal rotation period increases
with decreasing frequency. The variation range is from 24.4 to 22.5 days and
difference is about three times larger (1.9 days). However, at 925 MHz both
studies give similar rotation period. In Vats et al. (2001) the Pearson factor
with trend line was 0.86 whereas present analysis obtained a ~ 0.97 Pearson
factor with the trend line. Our study shows that the solar corona rotates
slower at higher altitudes, which is in contradiction to the findings reported
in Vats et al. (2001).

the problem of computing it by comparing three different algorithmic
methodologies: iterative, linear program, and on-the-fly. In a work presented
at FoSSaCS'12, Chen et al. characterized the bisimilarity distance of
Desharnais et al. between discrete-time Markov chains as an optimal solution of
a linear program that can be solved by using the ellipsoid method. Inspired by
their result, we propose a novel linear program characterization to compute the
distance in the continuous-time setting. Differently from previous proposals,
ours has a number of constraints that is bounded by a polynomial in the size of
the CTMC. This, in particular, proves that the distance we propose can be
computed in polynomial time. Despite its theoretical importance, the proposed
linear program characterization turns out to be inefficient in practice.
Nevertheless, driven by the encouraging results of our previous work presented
at TACAS'13, we propose an efficient on-the-fly algorithm, which, unlike the
other mentioned solutions, computes the distances between two given states
avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space. This technique works by
successively refining over-approximations of the target distances using a
greedy strategy, which ensures that the state space is further explored only
when the current approximations are improved. Tests performed on a consistent
set of (pseudo)randomly generated CTMCs show that our algorithm improves, on
average, the efficiency of the corresponding iterative and linear program
methods with orders of magnitude.

a lower mass accretion rate than expected during the bright state, suggesting
an evaporated plasma with a low density, thus consistent with a corona. Timing

quantum correlations arising in the bilocality scenario, that is a tripartite

independent sources of states. First, we prove that non-bilocal correlations
witnessed through a Bell-state measurement in the central node of the network
form a subset of those obtainable by means of a separable measurement. This
leads us to derive the maximal violation of the bilocality inequality that can
be achieved by arbitrary two-qubit quantum states and arbitrary projective
separable measurements. We then analyze in details the relation between the
violation of the bilocality inequality and the CHSH inequality. Finally, we
show how our method can be extended to n-locality scenario consisting of n

the monolayer is unstable towards a commensurate $2{\times}2$ periodic lattice

Prior work primarily provides convergence properties of the dynamics through
stochastic approximations, where the asymptotic behavior can be associated with
the limit points of an ordinary-differential equation (ODE). However, analyzing
global convergence through the ODE-approximation requires the existence of a
Lyapunov or a potential function, which naturally restricts the applicabity of

coil which is placed above a fast-spinning metal disc and connected to the
latter by sliding liquid-metal electrical contacts. Theoretically,
self-excitation of the magnetic field is expected at the critical magnetic
Reynolds number Rm~45, which corresponds to a critical rotation rate of about
10 Hz. We measured the magnetic field above the disc and the voltage drop on
the coil for the rotation rate up to 14 Hz, at which the liquid metal started
to leak from the outer sliding contact. Instead of the steady magnetic field
predicted by the theory we detected a strongly fluctuating magnetic field with
a strength comparable to that of Earth's magnetic field which was accompanied
by similar voltage fluctuations in the coil. These fluctuations seem to be
caused by the intermittent electrical contact through the liquid metal. The

resistance of liquid metal contacts could be excited at the rotation rate of
around 21 Hz provided that the leakage of liquid metal is prevented.

volumes defined by four nearby trajectories, and so on. Lyapunov exponents for
Hamiltonian systems are symmetric. The time-reversibility of the motion
equations links the growth and decay rates together in pairs. This pairing

further assigns a fractional ht-index - the fht-index - to an individual data

three sets of findings regarding classification volatility in the U.S. patent

classes. Reconstructed time series based on the current classification scheme
are very different from historical data. This suggests that using the current
classification to analyze the past produces a distorted view of the evolution

distribution is exponential so classes are of quite different sizes, but the
largest classes are not necessarily the oldest. To explain this pattern with a
simple stochastic growth model, we introduce the assumption that classes have a
regular chance to be split. Third, we study reclassification. The share of
patents that are in a different class now than they were at birth can be quite
high. Reclassification mostly occurs across classes belonging to the same
1-digit NBER category, but not always. We also document that reclassified
patents tend to be more cited than non-reclassified ones, even after

transforms of the emerging conical 2D spectra of the wavefield using
compressive sampling (CS) and then constructing 2D spectra from those
projections using filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm. For the 2D rogue

care formulations to provide more environment friendly products. Fabric
conditioners used as softeners have to fulfill a number of stability and
biodegradability requirements. They should also display significant adsorption
on cotton in the conditions of use. The quantification of surfactant adsorption
remains however difficult because the fabric woven structure is complex and
deposited amounts are generally small. Here we propose a method to evaluate
cellulose/sur-factant interactions with increased detection sensitivity. The
method is based on the use of cellulose nanocrystals in lieu of micron-sized
fibers or yarns, combined with different techni-ques including light
scattering, optical and electron microscopy, and electrophoretic mobili-ty.
Cellulose nanocrystals are rod-shaped nano-particles in the form of 200 nm
laths that are negatively charged and can be dispersed in bulk solutions. In
this work, we use a double-tailed cationic surfactant present in fabric
softener. Results show that the surfactants self-assemble into unilamellar,
multivesicular and multilamellar vesicles, and interaction with cellulose
nanocrys-tals is driven by electrostatics. Mutual interac-tions are strong and
lead to the formation of large-scale aggregates, where the vesicles remain
intact at the cellulose surface. The technique developed here could be
exploited to rapidly assess fabric conditioner efficiency obtained by varying
the nature and content of their chemical additives.

study a structured sampling strategy for such smooth graph signals that
consists of a random selection of few pre-defined groups of nodes. The number
of groups to sample to stably embed the set of $k$-bandlimited signals is
driven by a quantity called the \emph{group} graph cumulative coherence. For
some optimised sampling distributions, we show that sampling $O(k\log(k))$
groups is always sufficient to stably embed the set of $k$-bandlimited signals
but that this number can be smaller -- down to $O(\log(k))$ -- depending on the
structure of the groups of nodes. Fast methods to approximate these sampling
distributions are detailed. Second, we consider $k$-bandlimited signals that
are nearly piecewise constant over pre-defined groups of nodes. We show that it
is possible to speed up the reconstruction of such signals by reducing
drastically the dimension of the vectors to reconstruct. When combined with the
proposed structured sampling procedure, we prove that the method provides
stable and accurate reconstruction of the original signal. Finally, we present
numerical experiments that illustrate our theoretical results and, as an
example, show how to combine these methods for interactive object segmentation
in an image using superpixels.
