for the advancement of data analytics in many domains. Sharing through secure
computation and differential privacy allows these partners to perform private
computations on their sensitive data in controlled ways. However, in reality,
there exist complex relationships among members. Politics, regulations,
interest, trust, data demands and needs are one of the many reasons. Thus,
there is a need for a mechanism to meet these conflicting relationships on data
sharing. This paper presents Curie, an approach to exchange data among members
whose membership has complex relationships. The CPL policy language that allows
members to define the specifications of data exchange requirements is
introduced. Members (partners) assert who and what to exchange through their
local policies and negotiate a global sharing agreement. The agreement is
implemented in a multi-party computation that guarantees sharing among members
will comply with the policy as negotiated. The use of Curie is validated
through an example of a health care application built on recently introduced
secure multi-party computation and differential privacy frameworks, and policy
and performance trade-offs are explored.

update the approximation network thereby improving its quality. This provides a
new generic framework for approximate inference, allowing us to deploy highly

phone data can contribute to the social good and provide insights into human
behaviour on a large scale. The size of the datasets analysed ranges from 500
million to 300 billion phone records, covering millions of people. The key
contributions are two-fold:
  1. Big Data for Social Good: Through prediction algorithms the results show
how mobile phone data can be useful to predict important socio-economic
indicators, such as income, illiteracy and poverty in developing countries.
Such knowledge can be used to identify where vulnerable groups in society are,
reduce economic shocks and is a critical component for monitoring poverty rates
over time. Further, the dissertation demonstrates how mobile phone data can be
used to better understand human behaviour during large shocks in society,
exemplified by an analysis of data from the terror attack in Norway and a
natural disaster on the south-coast in Bangladesh. This work leads to an
increased understanding of how information spreads, and how millions of people
move around. The intention is to identify displaced people faster, cheaper and
more accurately than existing survey-based methods.
  2. Big Data for efficient marketing: Finally, the dissertation offers an
insight into how anonymised mobile phone data can be used to map out large
social networks, covering millions of people, to understand how products spread
inside these networks. Results show that by including social patterns and
machine learning techniques in a large-scale marketing experiment in Asia, the
adoption rate is increased by 13 times compared to the approach used by
experienced marketers. A data-driven and scientific approach to marketing,
through more tailored campaigns, contributes to less irrelevant offers for the
customers, and better cost efficiency for the companies.

are hard to interpret, as they have a complex dependence on dust optical
properties, grain alignment and magnetic field orientation. This is
particularly true in molecular clouds. The data available today are not yet
used to their full potential.
  The combination of emission and extinction, in particular, provides
information not available from either of them alone. We combine data from the
scientific literature on polarized dust extinction with Planck data on
polarized emission and we use them to constrain the possible variations in dust
and environmental conditions inside molecular clouds, and especially
translucent lines of sight, taking into account magnetic field orientation.
  We focus on the dependence between \lambda_max -- the wavelength of maximum
polarization in extinction -- and other observables such as the extinction
polarization, the emission polarization and the ratio of the two. We set out to
reproduce these correlations using Monte-Carlo simulations where the relevant
quantities in a dust model -- grain alignment, size distribution and magnetic
field orientation -- vary to mimic the diverse conditions expected inside
molecular clouds.
  None of the quantities chosen can explain the observational data on its own:
the best results are obtained when all quantities vary significantly across and
within clouds. However, some of the data -- most notably the stars with low
emission-to-extinction polarization ratio -- are not reproduced by our
simulation. Our results suggest not only that dust evolution is necessary to
explain polarization in molecular clouds, but that a simple change in size
distribution is not sufficient to explain the data, and point the way for
future and more sophisticated models.

(FC) is asked to make a binary decision about a sequence of system states by
relying on the possibly corrupted decisions provided by byzantine nodes, i.e.
nodes which deliberately alter the result of the local decision to induce an
error at the fusion center. When independent states are considered, the optimum
fusion rule over a batch of observations has already been derived, however its
complexity prevents its use in conjunction with large observation windows.
  In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm based on message passing
that greatly reduces the computational burden of the optimum fusion rule. In
addition, the proposed algorithm retains very good performance also in the case
of dependent system states. By first focusing on the case of small observation
windows, we use numerical simulations to show that the proposed scheme
introduces a negligible increase of the decision error probability compared to
the optimum fusion rule. We then analyse the performance of the new scheme when
the FC make its decision by relying on long observation windows. We do so by
considering both the case of independent and Markovian system states and show
that the obtained performance are superior to those obtained with prior
suboptimal schemes. As an additional result, we confirm the previous finding
that, in some cases, it is preferable for the byzantine nodes to minimise the
mutual information between the sequence system states and the reports submitted
to the FC, rather than always flipping the local decision.

instruments in 5 locations representative of the network. We compare three
different conceptual approaches for tide removal: frequency filtering, physical
modelling and data-based modelling. Each approach reveals a different
limitation to be considered depending on the intended application. Vestiges of
tides remain in the residues for the modelling procedures, whereas the signal
was distorted in different ways by the filtering and data-based procedures. The
linear techniques employed were power spectral density, spectrogram,
cross-correlation and classical harmonics decomposition, while the system
dynamics was analysed by state-space reconstruction and estimation of the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Although the tides could not be completely
eliminated, they were sufficiently reduced to allow observation of geophysical
events of interest above the $10 \text{ nm s}^{-2}$ level, exemplified by a
hydrology-related event of $60 \text{ nm s}^{-2}$. The implementations adopted
for each conceptual approach are general, so that their principles could be
applied to other kinds of data affected by undesired signals composed mainly by
periodic or quasi-periodic components.

used in glaciology for the discretization of the $\mathfrak{p}$-Stokes
equations: equal order finite elements with Galerkin Least-Squares (GLS)
stabilization. Furthermore we compare the results to other stabilized methods.
We find that the vertical velocity component is more sensitive to the choice of
GLS stabilization parameter than horizontal velocity. Additionally, the
accuracy of the vertical velocity component is especially important since
errors in this component can cause ice surface instabilities and propagate into
future ice volume predictions. If the element cell size is set to the minimum
edge length and the stabilization parameter is allowed to vary non-linearly
with viscosity, the GLS stabilization parameter found in literature is a good
choice on simple domains. However, near ice margins the standard parameter
choice may result in significant oscillations in the vertical component of the
surface velocity. For these cases, other stabilization techniques, such as the
interior penalty method, result in better accuracy and are less sensitive to
the choice of the stabilization parameter. During this work we also discovered
that the manufactured solutions often used to evaluate errors in glaciology are
not reliable due to high artificial surface forces at singularities. We perform
our numerical experiments in both FEniCS and Elmer/Ice.

of $\sim7$ in $\sim10$ ks with an exponential rise and a sharp fall in the
count rate. We investigate the origin of the soft X-ray excess emission and
rapid X-ray variability in the source through time-resolved spectroscopy and
fractional root-mean-squared (rms) spectral modeling. The strong soft X-ray
excess below 1 keV observed both in the time-averaged and time-resolved spectra
is described by the intrinsic disk Comptonization model as well as the
relativistic reflection model where the emission is intensive merely in the
inner regions ($r_{\rm in}<1.7 r_{\rm g}$) of an ionized accretion disk. We
detected no significant UV variability while the soft X-ray excess flux varies
together with the primary power-law emission (as $F_{{\rm primary}}\propto
F_{{\rm excess}}^{1.54}$), although with a smaller amplitude, as expected in
the reflection scenario. The observed X-ray fractional rms spectrum is
approximately constant with a drop at $\sim0.6$ keV and is described by a
non-variable emission line component with the observed energy of $\sim0.6$ keV
and two variable spectral components: a more variable primary power-law
emission and a less variable soft excess emission. Our results suggest the
`lamppost geometry' for the primary X-ray emitting hot corona which illuminates
the innermost accretion disk due to strong gravity and gives rise to the soft
X-ray excess emission.

in the analysis of time-dependent boundary integral equations and their space

inherited by convolution quadrature time discretisation based on A-stable
multistep methods, which are of order at most two. Here we study the question
as to which Runge--Kutta-based convolution quadrature methods inherit the
convolution coercivity property. It is shown that this holds without any
restriction for the third-order Radau IIA method, and on permitting a shift in
the Laplace domain variable, this holds for all algebraically stable
Runge--Kutta methods and hence for methods of arbitrary order. As an
illustration, the discrete convolution coercivity is used to analyse the
stability and convergence properties of the time discretisation of a non-linear
boundary integral equation that originates from a non-linear scattering problem
for the linear wave equation. Numerical experiments illustrate the error
behaviour of the Runge--Kutta convolution quadrature time discretisation.

are assumed. We compare our results to 1) mass loss rate estimates of
theoretical rotational evolution models, and 2) to results of the indirect
technique of determining mass loss rates: Lyman-alpha absorption. We are able
to derive the most stringent direct upper limits on mass loss so far from radio
observations. Two objects, EK Dra and Chi1 Ori, are detected at 6 and 14 GHz

radio emission identified as non-thermal emission was detected, but limits for

accuracy of many tasks. It is important to apply such models to different
domains because collecting many labeled samples in various domains is
expensive. In unsupervised domain adaptation, one needs to train a classifier
that works well on a target domain when provided with labeled source samples
and unlabeled target samples. Although many methods aim to match the
distributions of source and target samples, simply matching the distribution
cannot ensure accuracy on the target domain. To learn discriminative
representations for the target domain, we assume that artificially labeling
target samples can result in a good representation. Tri-training leverages
three classifiers equally to give pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, but the
method does not assume labeling samples generated from a different domain.In
this paper, we propose an asymmetric tri-training method for unsupervised
domain adaptation, where we assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and train
neural networks as if they are true labels. In our work, we use three networks
asymmetrically. By asymmetric, we mean that two networks are used to label
unlabeled target samples and one network is trained by the samples to obtain
target-discriminative representations. We evaluate our method on digit

fluctuations of the Kahler structure of the compact space and the form-field

actions for these fluctuations only takes the expected supergravity form if
certain additional ten- and eleven-dimensional higher-derivative terms for the

a detailed treatment of higher-derivative gravity coupled to Kahler structure

general relativity without approximations; i.e. it allows for arbitrarily
strong gravitational fields. For this reason, it applies not only to the Earth
and other planets but also to compact objects such as neutron stars. We define
the geoid as a level surface of a time-independent redshift potential. Such a
redshift potential exists in any stationary spacetime. Therefore, our geoid is
well defined for any rigidly rotating object with constant angular velocity and
a fixed rotation axis that is not subject to external forces. Our definition is
operational because the level surfaces of a redshift potential can be realized
with the help of standard clocks, which may be connected by optical fibers.
Therefore, these surfaces are also called isochronometric surfaces. We
deliberately base our definition of a relativistic geoid on the use of clocks
since we believe that clock geodesy offers the best methods for probing
gravitational fields with highest precision in the future. However, we also
point out that our definition of the geoid is mathematically equivalent to a
definition in terms of an acceleration potential, i.e. that our geoid may also
be viewed as a level surface orthogonal to plumb lines. Moreover, we
demonstrate that our definition reduces to the known Newtonian and
post-Newtonian notions in the appropriate limits. As an illustration, we
determine the isochronometric surfaces for rotating observers in axisymmetric
static and axisymmetric stationary solutions to Einstein's vacuum field
equation, with the Schwarzschild metric, the Erez-Rosen metric, the q-metric
and the Kerr metric as particular examples.

in the pursued goal. The accompanying information loss implies that
goal-oriented behavior is in one-to-one correspondence with an open subsystem
whose entropy decreases in time. Yet ultimately, the laws of physics are
reversible, so systems capable of yielding goal-directed behavior must transfer
the information about initial conditions to other degrees of freedom outside
the boundaries of the agent. To operate steadily, they must consume ordered
degrees of freedom provided as input, and be dispensed of disordered outputs
that act as wastes from the point of view of the aimed objective. Here I argue
that a physical system may or may not display goal-directed behavior depending
on what exactly is defined as the agent. The borders of the agent must be
carefully tailored so as to entail the appropriate information balance sheet.
In this game, observers play the role of tailors: They design agents by setting
the limits of the system of interest. Brain-guided subjects perform this
creative observation task naturally, implying that the observation of
goal-oriented behavior is a goal-oriented behavior in itself. Minds evolved to
cut out pieces of reality and endow them with intentionality, because ascribing
intentionality is an efficient way of modeling the world, and making
predictions. One most remarkable agent of whom we have indisputable evidence of
its goal-pursuing attitude is the self. Notably, this agent is simultaneously
the subject and the object of observation.

learn the transformation between age groups and thus would require the paired
samples as well as the labeled query image. In this paper, we look at the
problem from a generative modeling perspective such that no paired samples is
required. In addition, given an unlabeled image, the generative model can
directly produce the image with desired age attribute. We propose a conditional
adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) that learns a face manifold, traversing on which
smooth age progression and regression can be realized simultaneously. In CAAE,
the face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder,
and then the vector is projected to the face manifold conditional on age
through a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized
face features (i.e., personality) and the age condition controls progression
vs. regression. Two adversarial networks are imposed on the encoder and
generator, respectively, forcing to generate more photo-realistic faces.
Experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance and flexibility of
the proposed framework by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth.

reflection spaces that we call Kac-Moody symmetric spaces. These generalize
Riemannian symmetric spaces of non-compact type. We observe that in a
non-spherical Kac-Moody symmetric space there exist pairs of points that do not
lie on a common geodesic; however, any two points can be connected by a chain
of geodesic segments. We moreover classify maximal flats in Kac-Moody symmetric
spaces and study their intersection patterns, leading to a classification of
global and local automorphisms. Unlike Riemannian symmetric spaces,
non-spherical non-affine irreducible Kac-Moody symmetric spaces also admit an
invariant causal structure. For causal and anti-causal geodesic rays with
respect to this structure we find a notion of asymptoticity, which allows us to
define a future and past boundary of such Kac-Moody symmetric space. We show
that these boundaries carry a natural polyhedral structure and are cellularly
isomorphic to the halves of the geometric realization of the twin buildings of
the underlying split real Kac-Moody group. We also show that every automorphism
of the symmetric space is uniquely determined by the induced cellular
automorphism of the future and past boundary. The invariant causal structure on
a non-spherical non-affine irreducible Kac-Moody symmetric space gives rise to
an invariant pre-order on the underlying space, and thus to a subsemigroup of
the Kac-Moody group. We conclude that while in some aspects Kac-Moody symmetric
spaces closely resemble Riemannian symmetric spaces, in other aspects they
behave similarly to ordered affine hovels, their non-Archimedean cousins.

These are multipartite quantum states of the system of interest and a part of

such a state-structures in one of the canonical models of the condensed matter

a useful macroscopic description of battery cycling behavior, rooted in
microscopic physical models rather than empirical circuit approximations. The
theory relies on a separation of length scales to describe transport in the
electrode coupled to intercalation within small active material particles.
Typically, the active materials are described as solid solution particles with
transport and surface reactions driven by concentration fields, and the
thermodynamics are incorporated through fitting of the open circuit potential.
This approach has fundamental limitations, however, and does not apply to
phase-separating materials, for which the voltage is an emergent property of
inhomogeneous concentration profiles, even in equilibrium. Here, we present a
general theoretical framework for ""multiphase porous electrode theory""
implemented in an open-source software package called ""MPET"", based on
electrochemical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Cahn-Hilliard-type phase field
models are used to describe the solid active materials with suitably
generalized models of interfacial reaction kinetics. Classical concentrated
solution theory is implemented for the electrolyte phase, and Newman's porous
electrode theory is recovered in the limit of solid-solution active materials
with Butler-Volmer kinetics. More general, quantum-mechanical models of
Faradaic reactions are also included, such as Marcus-Hush-Chidsey kinetics for
electron transfer at metal electrodes, extended for concentrated solutions. The
full equations and numerical algorithms are described, and a variety of example
calculations are presented to illustrate the novel features of the software

colors and extinction for individual stars using unsupervised machine learning
algorithms. This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the
column density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any
combination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.
Furthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single
sources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction
vector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes
possible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability
densities. PNICER effectively eliminates known biases found in similar methods
and outperforms them in cases of deep observational data where the number of
background galaxies is significant, or when a large number of parameters is
used to break degeneracies in the intrinsic color distributions. This new
method remains computationally competitive, making it possible to correctly
de-redden millions of sources within a matter of seconds. With the
ever-increasing number of large-scale high-sensitivity imaging surveys, PNICER
offers a fast and reliable way to efficiently calculate extinction for

a misleadingly high amplitude of the conformity signal. These include a
weighting in favour of central galaxies in very high-density regions, the
likely misclassification of satellite galaxies as centrals in the same
high-density regions, and the use of medians to characterize bimodal
distributions. We show that the large-scale conformity signal in Kauffmann et

vicinity of just a few very massive clusters, whose effect is strongly
amplified by the methodological issues that we have identified. Some of these
'centrals' are likely misclassified satellites, but some may be genuine
centrals showing a real conformity effect. Regardless, this analysis suggests
that conformity on 4 Mpc scales is best viewed as a relatively short-range
effect (at the virial radius) associated with these very large neighbouring
haloes, rather than a very long-range effect (at tens of virial radii)
associated with the relatively low-mass haloes that host the nominal central
galaxies in the analysis. A mock catalogue constructed from a recent
semi-analytic model shows very similar conformity effects to the data when
analysed in the same way, suggesting that there is no need to introduce new
physical processes to explain galactic conformity on 4 Mpc scales.

at $\sim$10 days and the slope of the occurrence rate down to $\sim$1 day can
be attributed to the truncation of protoplanetary disks by their host star
magnetospheres at co-rotation. We demonstrate this by deriving planet
occurrence rate profiles from empirical distributions of pre-main-sequence
stellar rotation periods. Observed profiles are better reproduced when planets
are distributed randomly in disks---as might be expected if planets formed in
situ---rather than piled up near disk edges, as would be the case if they
migrated in by disk torques. Planets can be brought from disk edges to
ultra-short ($< 1$ day) periods by asynchronous equilibrium tides raised on
their stars. Tidal migration can account for how ultra-short period planets
(USPs) are more widely spaced than their longer period counterparts. Our
picture provides a starting point for understanding why metal-rich stars tend
to harbor more USPs, and why the sub-Neptune population drops at $\sim$10 days
regardless of whether the host star is of type FGK or early M. We predict
planet occurrence rates around A stars to also break at short periods, but at

the analysis were initially selected from the Motion Verified Red Stars

of stellar age (H$\alpha$ and Li ${\rm{\small I}}$) and luminosity class, that
the parent sample is likely comprised of field dwarfs ($\gtrsim$ 1 Gyr). We
also develop the Low-mass Kinematics ($LoKi$) galactic model to estimate the
completeness of the extreme MIR excess sample. Using Galactic height as a proxy
for stellar age, the completeness corrected analysis indicates a distinct age
dependence for field stars exhibiting extreme MIR excesses. We also find a
trend with stellar mass (using $r-z$ color as a proxy). Our findings are
consistent with the detected extreme MIR excesses originating from dust created
in a short-lived collisional cascade ($\lesssim$ 100,000 years) during a giant
impact between two large planetismals or terrestrial planets. These stars with
extreme MIR excesses also provide support for planetary collisions being the

conformally related to general relativity. All dimensionless ratios of
fundamental dimensional quantities, e.g. particle masses and the Planck mass,
as well as the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions, are fixed
constants. An interplay between the positive energy density associated with
relativistic matter (and possibly with negative spatial curvature) and the
negative energy associated with dynamical dilaton phase results in a
non-singular, flat cosmological model with no horizon, and -- as a direct
consequence of absence of phase transitions in the early universe -- with no
production of topological defects. The (logarithmic) time-derivative of the
field modulus is degenerate with the Hubble function, and all cosmological
epochs of the standard model are unchanged except at the very early universe.
We demonstrate that both linear order perturbation theory and the spherical
collapse model are equivalent to those in the standard model, up to
modifications caused by the phase of the (complex) scalar field and its
perturbations. Consequently, our alternative theory automatically passes the
main classical cosmological tests. Quantum excitations of the phase of the
scalar field generate a slightly red-tilted spectrum of adiabatic and gaussian
scalar perturbations on the largest scales. However, this framework does not
provide a similar mechanism for producing primordial gravitational waves on
these scales. A spherically symmetric vacuum solution that approximately
describes the exterior of gravitationally bound systems (e.g., stars and
galaxies) by a modified Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, augmented with an
additional linear potential term, could possibly explain galactic rotation
curves and strong gravitational lensing with no recourse to dark matter.

\emph{chain rule} of the form $H(X,Y) = H(X|Y)+H(Y)$, known for Shannon
Entropy. Such a property would help to analyze how min-entropy is split among
smaller blocks. Problems of this kind arise for example when constructing
extractors and dispersers.
  We show that any sequence of variables exhibits a very strong strong
block-source structure (conditional distributions of blocks are nearly flat)
when we \emph{spoil few correlated bits}. This implies, conditioned on the
spoiled bits, that \emph{splitting-recombination properties} hold. In
particular, we have many nice properties that min-entropy doesn't obey in
general, for example strong chain rules, ""information can't hurt"" inequalities,
equivalences of average and worst-case conditional entropy definitions and
others. Quantitatively, for any sequence $X_1,\ldots,X_t$ of random variables
over an alphabet $\mathcal{X}$ we prove that, when conditioned on $m = t\cdot
O( \log\log|\mathcal{X}| + \log\log(1/\epsilon) + \log t)$ bits of auxiliary
information, all conditional distributions of the form $X_i|X_{<i}$ are
$\epsilon$-close to be nearly flat (only a constant factor away). The argument
is combinatorial (based on simplex coverings).
  This result may be used as a generic tool for \emph{exhibiting block-source
structures}. We demonstrate this by reproving the fundamental converter due to
Nisan and Zuckermann (\emph{J. Computer and System Sciences, 1996}), which
shows that sampling blocks from a min-entropy source roughly preserves the
entropy rate. Our bound implies, only by straightforward chain rules, an
additive loss of $o(1)$ (for sufficiently many samples), which qualitatively
meets the first tighter analysis of this problem due to Vadhan
(\emph{CRYPTO'03}), obtained by large deviation techniques.

the field via binary star evolution, or in dense stellar systems via dynamical
interactions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)
has detected black hole binaries (BHBs) via their gravitational radiation.
These detections provide us with information about the physical parameters of
the system. It has been claimed that when the Laser Interferometer Space

will allow us to derive the channels that lead to their formation. However, we
show that for BHBs in dense stellar systems dynamical interactions could lead
to high eccentricities such that a fraction of the relativistic mergers are not
audible to LISA. A non-detection by LISA puts a lower limit of about $0.005$ on
the eccentricity of a BHB entering the LIGO band. On the other hand, a
deci-Hertz observatory, like DECIGO or Tian Qin, would significantly enhance
the chances of a joint detection, and shed light on the formation channels of

This system is out of equilibrium due to the presence of anisotropy and/or a
massive scalar field. Considering various functions for the initial anisotropy
and scalar field, we conclude that the effect of the anisotropy on the
evolution of the two-point function is considerably more than the effect of the
scalar field. We also show that the ordering of the equilibration time of the
one-point function for the non-probe scalar field and the correlation function
between two points with a fixed separation can be reversed by changing the
initial configuration of the plasma, when the system is out of the equilibrium
due to the presence of at least two different sources like our problem. In
addition, we find the equilibration time of the two-point function to be
linearly increasing with respect to the separation of the two points with a
fixed slope, regardless of the initial configuration that we start with.
Finally we observe that, for larger separations the geodesic connecting two
points on the boundary crosses the event horizon after it has reached its final
equilibrium value, meaning that the two-point function can probe behind the

Among these demonstrations, one material system (GdFeCo ferromagnetic films) is
particularly interesting, as deterministic toggle-switching of the magnetic
order has been achieved without the need of any symmetry breaking magnetic
field. This phenomenon is often referred to as all optical switching (AOS).
However, so far, GdFeCo remains the only material system where such
deterministic switching has been observed. When extended to ferromagnetic
systems, which are of greater interest in many technological applications, only
a partial effect can be achieved, which in turn requires repeated laser pulses
for full switching. However, such repeated pulsing is not only energy hungry,
it also negates the speed advantage of AOS. Motivated by this problem, we have
developed a general method for single-shot, picosecond timescale, complete all
optical switching of ferromagnetic materials. We demonstrate that in
exchange-coupled layers of Co/Pt and GdFeCo, single shot, switching of the
ferromagnetic Co/Pt layer is achieved within 7 picoseconds after irradiation by
a femtosecond laser pulse. We believe that this approach will greatly expand
the range of materials and applications for ultrafast magnetic switching.

differences, ratios, or quantile effects, either marginally or for
subpopulations of interest. The proposed BNP model is well-suited for causal
inference problems, as it does not require parametric assumptions about the
distribution of confounders and naturally leads to a computationally efficient
Gibbs sampling algorithm. By flexibly modeling the joint distribution, we are
also able to impute (via data augmentation) values for missing covariates
within the algorithm under an assumption of ignorable missingness, obviating
the need to create separate imputed data sets. This approach for imputing the
missing covariates has the additional advantage of guaranteeing congeniality
between the imputation model and the analysis model, and because we use a BNP

this paper, which are not restrictive for traffic applications, the existence
of open-loop control policies is sufficient and almost necessary to ensure the
satisfaction of STL formulas. We establish a relation between satisfaction of
STL formulas in infinite time and set-invariance theories and provide an
efficient method to compute robust control invariant sets in high dimensions.
We also develop a robust model predictive framework to plan controls optimally
while ensuring the satisfaction of the specification. Illustrative examples and
a traffic management case study are included.

networks (CNNs), have led to significant improvement over previous semantic
segmentation systems. Here we show how to improve pixel-wise semantic
segmentation by manipulating convolution-related operations that are of both
theoretical and practical value. First, we design dense upsampling convolution
(DUC) to generate pixel-level prediction, which is able to capture and decode
more detailed information that is generally missing in bilinear upsampling.
Second, we propose a hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) framework in the encoding
phase. This framework 1) effectively enlarges the receptive fields (RF) of the
network to aggregate global information; 2) alleviates what we call the
""gridding issue"" caused by the standard dilated convolution operation. We
evaluate our approaches thoroughly on the Cityscapes dataset, and achieve a
state-of-art result of 80.1% mIOU in the test set at the time of submission. We
also have achieved state-of-the-art overall on the KITTI road estimation

  variants in distinguishing neutrality from novelty biases",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neutral evolution assumes that there are no selective forces distinguishing
different variants in a population. Despite this striking assumption, many
recent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good
description of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to
test whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny
distributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given
number of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is
the distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model we show
that these distributions consist of two phases: a power law phase with a
constant exponent of -3/2, followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with
very large numbers of progeny. Maximum likelihood estimations of the model
parameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical
patterns are consistent with neutral evolution. We apply our approach to a
complete data set of baby names from Australia. Crucially we show that analyses
based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of
cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission
hypotheses. While neutrality provides a plausible description of progeny
distributions of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality.
Further, we develop a simulation framework that allows for the detection of
alternative cultural transmission processes. We show that anti-novelty bias is
able to replicate the complete progeny distribution of the Australian data set.

SDSS are significantly larger than those reported by the SDSS pipeline. This is
because of a combination of three effects: one is simply a matter of defining
the scale out to which one integrates the fit when defining the total
luminosity, and amounts on average to < 0.1 mags even for the most luminous
galaxies. The other two are less trivial and tend to be larger; they are due to
differences in how the background sky is estimated and what model is fit to the
surface brightness profile. We show that PyMorph sky estimates are fainter than
those of the SDSS DR7 or DR9 pipelines, but are in excellent agreement with the
estimates of Blanton et al. (2011). Using the SDSS sky biases luminosities by
more than a few tenths of a magnitude for objects with half-light radii > 7
arcseconds. In the SDSS main galaxy sample these are typically luminous
galaxies, so they are not necessarily nearby. This bias becomes worse when
allowing the model more freedom to fit the surface brightness profile. When
PyMorph sky values are used, then two component Sersic-Exponential fits to
E+S0s return more light than single component deVaucouleurs fits (up to ~0.2
mag), but less light than single Sersic fits (0.1 mag). Finally, we show that
PyMorph fits of Meert et al. (2015) to DR7 data remain valid for DR9 images.
Our findings show that, especially at large luminosities, these PyMorph
estimates should be preferred to the SDSS pipeline values.

high luminosities, than does the de Vaucouleurs model used by the SDSS
pipeline. We use the PyMorph photometric reductions to isolate effect (ii) and
show that it is the same in the full sample as in small group environments, and
for satellites in the most massive clusters as well. None of these are expected
to be significantly affected by intracluster light (ICL). We only see an
additional effect for centrals in the most massive halos, but we argue that
even this is not dominated by ICL. Hence, for the vast majority of galaxies,
the differences between PyMorph and SDSS pipeline photometry cannot be ascribed
to the semantics of whether or not one includes the ICL when describing the
stellar mass of massive galaxies. Rather, they likely reflect differences in
star formation or assembly histories. Failure to account for the SDSS
underestimate has significantly biased most previous estimates of the SDSS
luminosity and stellar mass functions, and therefore Halo Model estimates of
the z ~ 0.1 relation between the mass of a halo and that of the galaxy at its

These global magnetic fields trap and deflect outflowing stellar wind material,
forming an anisotropic magnetosphere that can be probed with wind-sensitive UV
resonance lines. Recent HST UV spectra of NGC 1624-2, the most magnetic O star

bias in lending, hiring, and policing decisions. For example, in the case of
credit extensions, these tests aim to estimate the bar for granting loans to
white and minority applicants, with a higher inferred threshold for minorities
indicative of discrimination. This technique, however, requires fitting a
complex Bayesian latent variable model for which inference is often
computationally challenging. Here we develop a method for fitting threshold
tests that is two orders of magnitude faster than the existing approach,
reducing computation from hours to minutes. To achieve these performance gains,
we introduce and analyze a flexible family of probability distributions on the
interval [0, 1] -- which we call discriminant distributions -- that is
computationally efficient to work with. We demonstrate our technique by
analyzing 2.7 million police stops of pedestrians in New York City.

relaxation, we propose a fully distributed iterative algorithm, which enables
each node to adjust its date allocation/ rate adaption among any given set of
next hops solely based on information from the neighboring nodes. Moreover, the
proposed traffic allocation algorithm converges to the optimal value of the
convex relaxation at a $O(1/K)$ rate, where $K$ is the iteration counter, with
a bounded optimality. At the end of this paper, we perform numerical
simulations to demonstrate the soundness of the developed algorithm.

scattering and in transmission modes to probe the magnetization of Co and Cr
separately. The transmission measurements utilized X-ray excited optical
luminescence from the substrate. Resonant soft X-ray diffraction (RSXD) was
used to study the magnetic order of the low temperature phase. The XMCD signals
of Co and Cr appear at the same ordering temperature Tc~90K, and are always
opposite in sign. The coercive field of the Co and of Cr moments is the same,

explain this hardening. The RSXD signal of the (q q 0) reflection appears below
Ts, the same ordering temperature as the conical magnetic structure in bulk,

azimuthal dependence of this reflection, a slight modification is required to

frustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular
lattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents
anti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal
outcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe
complex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to
a honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence
of the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to
the microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of
mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also
consider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course
the topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal
links of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square
lattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is
a direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a
method to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.

embedded in an oscillatory background is demonstrated by using 2:1 frequency
locking oscillatory system. The localization is of Turing type and appears in
two space dimensions as a comb-like state in either $\pi$ phase shifted Hopf
oscillations or inside a spiral core. Specifically, the localized states appear
in absence of the well known flip-flop dynamics (associated with collapsed
homoclinic snaking) that is known to arise in the vicinity of Hopf-Turing
bifurcation in one space dimension. Derivation and analysis of three
Hopf-Turing amplitude equations in two space dimensions reveals a local
dynamics pinning mechanism for Hopf fronts, which in turn allows the emergence
of perpendicular (to the Hopf front) Turing states. The results are shown to
agree well with the comb-like core size that forms inside spiral waves. In the

connection between clustering coefficients known in SNA community for 1-mode
and 2-mode networks and OA-bicluster density, the main quality measure of an
OA-bicluster. Our experiments with 2-, 3-, and 4-mode large real-world networks
show that this type of patterns is suitable for community detection in
multi-mode cases within reasonable time even though the number of corresponding
$n$-cliques is still unknown due to computation difficulties. An interpretation
of OA-biclusters for 1-mode networks is provided as well.

Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate parameter distributions and
provide uncertainty quantification. An important model input is the at-risk
susceptible population, which can vary with a number of factors including
climate, elevation, population density, and socio-economic status. We informed
this initial condition using the highest historically reported dengue incidence
modified by the probable dengue reporting rates in the chosen countries. The

We then estimated the basic reproduction number, or the expected number of new
human infections arising from a single infected human, to range between 4 and 6

estimated the reporting rate to be around 16% in El Salvador and 18% in

Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, $\Sigma_{SFR} \propto \Sigma_{gas}^N$, at different
spatial scales. We simulate synthetic observations in CO lines and UV band. We
adopt the star formation rate defined in two ways: based on free fall collapse
of a molecular cloud - $\Sigma_{SFR, cl}$, and calculated by using a UV flux
calibration - $\Sigma_{SFR, UV}$. We study a KS relation for spatially smoothed
maps with effective spatial resolution from molecular cloud scales to several
hundred parsecs. We find that for spatially and kinematically resolved
molecular clouds the $\Sigma_{SFR, cl} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^N$ relation
follows the power-law with index $N \approx 1.4$. Using UV flux as SFR
calibrator we confirm a systematic offset between the $\Sigma_{\rm UV}$ and
$\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ distributions on scales compared to molecular cloud sizes.
Degrading resolution of our simulated maps for surface densities of gas and
star formation rates we establish that there is no relation $\Sigma_{\rm SFR,
UV} - \Sigma_{\rm gas}$ below the resolution $\sim 50$ pc. We find a transition
range around scales $\sim 50-120$ pc, where the power-law index $N$ increases
from 0 to 1-1.8 and saturates for scales larger $\sim 120$ pc. A value of the
index saturated depends on a surface gas density threshold and it becomes
steeper for higher $\Sigma_{gas}$ threshold. Averaging over scales with size of
$>150$ pc the power-law index $N$ equals 1.3-1.4 for surface gas density
threshold $\sim 5 M_\odot$pc$^{-2}$. At scales $>120$ pc surface SFR densities
determined by using CO data and UV flux, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR, UV}/\Sigma_{\rm SFR,
cl}$, demonstrate a discrepancy about a factor of 3. We argue that this may be
originated from overestimating (constant) values of conversion factor, star
formation efficiency or UV calibration used in our analysis.

For the physically important case of spin one, the geometric phase is

  As a secondary study, using crowdsourcing at a cost of $200, we studied 250
pull requests from 142 GitHub projects. The prior qualitative findings are
mapped into questions for crowds workers. Their answers were converted into
binary features to build a predictor which predicts whether code would be

interval estimation of a parameter of interest, and hence, the selection of an
appropriate estimator is important. The criterion for a good estimator is to
have a high coverage probability close to the nominal level and a shorter
interval length. However, these two concepts are in opposition to each other:
high and low coverages are associated with longer and shorter interval lengths
respectively. Some methods, such as bootstrap calibration, modify the nominal
level to improve the coverage and thereby allow the selection of intervals
based on interval lengths only. Nonetheless, these methods are computationally
expensive. In this paper, we propose an index which offers an easy to compute
approach of comparing confidence interval estimators based on a compromise
between the coverage probability and the confidence interval length. We
illustrate that the confidence interval index has range of values within the
neighborhood of the range of the coverage probability, [0,1]. In addition, a
good confidence interval estimator has an index value approaching 1; and a bad
confidence interval has an index value approaching 0. A simulation study was

compound, based only on its chemical composition, is crucial to the study of
materials and their applications. Despite considerable ongoing research
efforts, crystal structure prediction remains a challenging problem that
demands large computational resources. Here we propose an efficient approach
for first-principles crystal structure prediction. The new method explores and
finds crystal structures by tiling together elementary tetrahedra that are
energetically favorable and geometrically matching each other. This approach
has three distinguishing features: a favorable building unit, an efficient
calculation of local energy, and a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation of crystal
growth. By applying the method to the crystal structure prediction of various
materials, we demonstrate its validity and potential as a promising alternative
to current methods.

disks appears to be shorter than around single stars, and the actual
dissipation process may depend on the binary parameters of the systems. Aims.
We report high spatial resolution observations of multiple T Tauri systems at
optical and infrared wavelengths. We determine if the components are
gravitationally bound and orbital motion is visible, derive orbital parameters
and investigate possible correlations between the binary parameters and disk
states. Methods. We selected 18 T Tau multiple systems (16 binary and two
triple systems, yielding $16 + 2\times2=20$ binary pairs) in the Taurus-Auriga
star forming region from the survey by Leinert et al. (1993), with spectral
types from K1 to M5 and separations from 0.22"" (31 AU) to 5.8"" (814 AU). We
analysed data acquired in 2006-07 at Calar Alto using the AstraLux lucky
imaging system, along with data from SPHERE and NACO at the VLT, and from the
literature. Results. We found ten pairs to orbit each other, five pairs that
may show orbital motion and five likely common proper motion pairs. We found no
obvious correlation between the stellar parameters and binary configuration.
The 10 $\mu$m infra-red excess varies between 0.1 and 7.2 magnitudes (similar
to the distribution in single stars, where it is between 1.7 and 9.1), implying
that the presence of the binary star does not greatly influence the emission
from the inner disk. Conclusions. We have detected orbital motion in young T
Tauri systems over a timescale of $\approx20$ years. Further observations with
even longer temporal baseline will provide crucial information on the dynamics
of these young stellar systems.

often reveal surge-like oscillatory activities above sunspot light bridges.
These oscillations are often interpreted as intermittent plasma jets produced
by quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection. We have analyzed the oscillations
above a light bridge in a sunspot using data taken by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). The chromospheric 2796\AA{}~images show surge-like
activities above the entire light bridge at any time, forming an oscillating
wall. Within the wall we often see that the Mg~{\sc{ii}}~k 2796.35\AA{}~line
core first experiences a large blueshift, and then gradually decreases to zero
shift before increasing to a red shift of comparable magnitude. Such a behavior
suggests that the oscillations are highly nonlinear and likely related to
shocks. In the 1400\AA{}~passband which samples emission mainly from the
Si~{\sc{iv}}~ion, the most prominent feature is a bright oscillatory front
ahead of the surges. We find a positive correlation between the acceleration
and maximum velocity of the moving front, which is consistent with numerical
simulations of upward propagating slow-mode shock waves. The Si~{\sc{iv}}
1402.77\AA{}~line profile is generally enhanced and broadened in the bright
front, which might be caused by turbulence generated through compression or by
the shocks. These results, together with the fact that the oscillation period
stays almost unchanged over a long duration, lead us to propose that the
surge-like oscillations above light bridges are caused by shocked p-mode waves
leaked from the underlying photosphere.

immersed in a Fermi gas at zero and at finite temperature. Studying both the
frequency and the time domain allows one to identify interaction regimes that
are characterized by distinct many-body dynamics. From this theoretical study a
picture emerges in which impurity dynamics is universal on essentially all time
scales, and where the high-frequency few-body response is related to the
long-time dynamics of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe by Tan relations.
Our theoretical description relies on different and complementary approaches:
functional determinants give an exact numerical solution for time- and
frequency-resolved responses, bosonization provides analytical expressions at
low temperatures, and the theory of Toeplitz determinants allows one to
analytically predict response up to high temperatures. Using these approaches
we predict the thermal decoherence rate and prove that within the considered
model the fastest rate of long-time decoherence is given by $\gamma=\pi
k_BT/4$. We show that Feshbach resonances in cold atomic systems give access to
new interaction regimes where quantum effects prevail even in the thermal
regime of many-body dynamics. The key signature of this phenomenon is a
crossover between exponential decay rates of the real-time Ramsey signal. It is
shown that the physics of the orthogonality catastrophe is experimentally
observable up to temperatures $T/T_F\lesssim 0.2$ where it leaves its
fingerprint in a power-law temperature dependence of thermal spectral weight
and we review how this phenomenon is related to the physics of heavy ions in
liquid $^3$He and the formation of Fermi polarons. The presented results are in
excellent agreement with recent experiments on LiK mixtures, and we predict
several phenomena that can be tested using currently available experimental
technology.

partially spin polarized one, carefully incorporating corrections due to finite
width and Landau level mixing, and find it to be in satisfactory agreement with
the Zeeman energy where a qualitative change has been observed for the onset
bias voltage [Eisenstein et al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 125409 (2016)]. For
fractional quantum Hall states, we predict a substantial discontinuous jump in
$V_{\rm max}$ when the system undergoes a transition from a fully spin
polarized state to a spin singlet or a partially spin polarized state.

The uniqueness of the approach proposed in this paper lies in the convex

various realistic case studies based on pricing and demand data from the

Group galaxy M31 was detected as a marginally extended gamma-ray source, while
only an upper limit (UL) has been derived for the other nearby galaxy M33. We
revisited the gamma-ray emission in the direction of M31 and M33 using more
than 7 yr of LAT Pass 8 data in the energy range 0.1-100 GeV, presenting
detailed morphological and spectral analyses. M33 remains undetected and we
computed an UL for it. This revised UL remains consistent with the observed
correlation between gamma-ray luminosity and star-formation rate tracers and
implies an average CR density in M33 that is at most half of that of the MW.
M31 is detected with a significance of nearly 10 sigma and to be extended with
4 sigma. Its spectrum is consistent with a power law. The spatial distribution
of the emission is consistent with a uniform disk with a radius of 0.4 deg and
no offset from the center of M31, but nonuniform intensity distributions cannot
be excluded. The flux from M31 appears confined to the inner regions of the
galaxy and does not fill the disk or extend far from it. The gamma-ray signal
is not correlated with regions rich in gas or star-formation activity
suggesting that the emission is not interstellar in origin, unless the
energetic particles radiating in gamma rays do not originate in recent star
formation. Alternative and nonexclusive interpretations are that the emission
results from a population of millisecond pulsars dispersed in the bulge and
disk of M31 by disrupted globular clusters or from the decay or annihilation of
dark matter particles, similar to what has been proposed to account for the
so-called Galactic Center excess found in Fermi-LAT observations of the MW.

FSRQ-like, which maybe within 90% level of confidence. Similarly, 77.3% of the

may be FSRQ-like sources. And 88.7% of the BL Lac-like BCUs that have

driplines. They consist of a core and one or a few nucleons which spend most of
their time in the classically-forbidden region outside the range of the
interaction. Individual nucleons inside the core are thus unresolved in the
halo configuration, and the low-energy effective interactions are short-range
forces between the core and the valence nucleons. Similar phenomena occur in
clusters of $^4$He atoms, cold atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance, and some
exotic hadrons. In these weakly-bound quantum systems universal scaling laws
for s-wave binding emerge that are independent of the details of the
interaction. Effective field theory (EFT) exposes these correlations and
permits the calculation of non-universal corrections to them due to
short-distance effects, as well as the extension of these ideas to systems
involving the Coulomb interaction and/or binding in higher angular-momentum
channels. Halo nuclei exhibit all these features. Halo EFT, the EFT for halo
nuclei, has been used to compute the properties of single-neutron, two-neutron,
and single-proton halos of s-wave and p-wave type. This review summarizes these
results for halo binding energies, radii, Coulomb dissociation, and radiative
capture, as well as the connection of these properties to scattering
parameters, thereby elucidating the universal correlations between all these

Moreover, among the 1982 QSOs, there are 708 QSOs with the [O~{\sc

extended component. Based on the luminosity from the core components ($L_{\rm

tighter than the correlations on the total \oiii luminosity and on the
luminosity of the core components of the \oiii lines. Therefore, the luminosity
of the extended components should be better applied to trace AGN intrinsic
luminosity. Meanwhile, we have found strong line width correlation and line
luminosity correlation between the core components and the extended components,
indicating the extended components of the \oiii lines should be not due to
commonly considered radial flows in the common \oiii line clouds. And virial
effects due to gravity of central black holes naturally lead to the wider
extended components from regions more nearer to central black holes. Finally,
we can say that the reported correlation of $L_{{\rm

of the \oiii lines should be more better to estimate AGN intrinsic luminosity
in Type-2 narrow line AGN, because of totally/partly obscured extended

acceleration and resulting observational consequences. We derive conditions for
avoiding ghosts and instabilities of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations
and discuss viable parameter spaces in concrete models allowing the dark energy
equation of state smaller than $-1$. The propagation speeds of those
perturbations are subject to modifications beyond the domain of generalized
Proca theories. There is a mixing between scalar and matter sound speeds, but
such a mixing is suppressed during most of the cosmic expansion history without
causing a new instability. On the other hand, we find that derivative
interactions arising in beyond-generalized Proca theories give rise to
important modifications to the cosmic growth history. The growth rate of matter
perturbations can be compatible with the redshift-space distortion data due to
the realization of gravitational interaction weaker than that in generalized
Proca theories. Thus, it is possible to distinguish the dark energy model in

technique used for the primary vertex reconstruction on the assumption that the
metastable particles are always pair-produced and their decay products contain
high-$p_{\rm T}$ jets. We show that, by applying a cut based on displaced
vertices on top of standard kinematical cuts for the search of new particles,
the LHC reach can be significantly extended if the decay length is $\gtrsim
100~\mu{\rm m}$. In addition, we may measure the lifetime of the target
particle through the reconstruction of displaced vertices, which plays an
important role in understanding the new physics behind the metastable

galaxy surveys. Mis-identification of central galaxies causes systematics in
various studies such as cluster lensing, satellite kinematics, and galaxy
clustering. The red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation
(redMaPPer) estimates the probability that each member galaxy is central from
photometric information rather than specifying one central galaxy. The
redMaPPer estimates can be used for calibrating the off-centring effect,
however, the centring algorithm has not previously been well-tested. We test
the centring probabilities of redMaPPer cluster catalog using the projected
cross correlation between redMaPPer clusters with photometric red galaxies and
galaxy-galaxy lensing. We focus on the subsample of redMaPPer clusters in which
the redMaPPer central galaxies (RMCGs) are not the brightest member galaxies
(BMEM) and both of them have spectroscopic redshift. This subsample represents
nearly 10% of the whole cluster sample. We find a clear difference in the
cross-correlation measurements between RMCGs and BMEMs, and the estimated
centring probability is 74$\pm$10% for RMCGs and 13$\pm$4% for BMEMs in the
Gaussian offset model and 78$\pm$9% for RMCGs and 5$\pm$5% for BMEMs in the NFW
offset model. These values are in agreement with the centring probability
values reported by redMaPPer (75% for RMCG and 10% for BMEMs) within 1$\sigma$.
Our analysis provides a strong consistency test of the redMaPPer centring
probabilities. Our results suggest that redMaPPer centring probabilities are
reliably estimated. We confirm that the brightest galaxy in the cluster is not
always the central galaxy as has been shown in previous works.

Miratrix","Bridging Finite and Super Population Causal Inference",,"Journal of Causal Inference, 2017",,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are two general views in causal analysis of experimental data: the
super population view that the units are an independent sample from some

solely from the physical randomization of the treatment assignment. These two
views differs conceptually and mathematically, resulting in different sampling
variances of the usual difference-in-means estimator of the average causal

state functional magnetic resonance imaging. However, the pattern,
organization, and function of fine-scale network activity remain largely
unknown. Here we characterized the spontaneously emerging visual cortical
activity by applying independent component analysis to resting state fMRI
signals exclusively within the visual cortex. In this sub-system scale, we
observed about 50 spatially independent components that were reproducible
within and across subjects, and analyzed their spatial patterns and temporal
relationships to reveal the intrinsic parcellation and organization of the
visual cortex. We found that the visual cortical parcels were aligned with the
steepest gradient of cortical myelination, and organized into functional
modules segregated along the dorsal/ventral pathways and foveal/peripheral
early visual areas. In contrast, cortical retinotopy, folding, and
cytoarchitecture impose limited constraints to the organization of resting
state activity. From these findings, we conclude that spontaneous activity
patterns in the visual cortex are primarily organized by visual streams, likely
reflecting feedback network interactions.

rely on weakly-guided, stochastic searches to drive the learning process. It
can therefore be difficult to predict what agent behaviors might emerge. In
this paper, we consider an information-theoretic cost function for performing
constrained stochastic searches that promote the formation of risk-averse to
risk-favoring behaviors. This cost function is the value of information, which
provides the optimal trade-off between the expected return of a policy and the
policy's complexity; policy complexity is measured by number of bits and
controlled by a single hyperparameter on the cost function. As the policy
complexity is reduced, the agents will increasingly eschew risky actions. This
reduces the potential for high accrued rewards. As the policy complexity
increases, the agents will take actions, regardless of the risk, that can raise
the long-term rewards. The obtainable reward depends on a single, tunable
hyperparameter that regulates the degree of policy complexity.
  We evaluate the performance of value-of-information-based policies on a
stochastic version of Ms. Pac-Man. A major component of this paper is the
demonstration that ranges of policy complexity values yield different game-play
styles and explaining why this occurs. We also show that our
reinforcement-learning search mechanism is more efficient than the others we
utilize. This result implies that the value of information theory is
appropriate for framing the exploitation-exploration trade-off in reinforcement
learning.

the inner Galaxy MCs. These MCs with a median Galactocentric radius of 12.6
kpc, show very different distributions from those of the MCs in the Outer arm
published in our previous paper, while roughly follow the Outer
Scutum-Centaurus arm defined by Dame & Thaddeus 2011. This result may provide a
robust evidence for the existence of the Outer Scutum-Centaurus arm. The lower
limit of the total mass of this segment is about 2.7$\times$10$^5$ $M_{\sun}$,
which is about one magnitude lower than that of the Outer arm. The mean
thickness of gaseous disk is about 1.45$^{\circ}$ or 450~pc, and the scale
height is about 1.27$^{\circ}$ or 400~pc above the $b=0^{\circ}$ plane. The
warp traced by CO emission is very obvious in the EOG region and its amplitude
is consistent with the predictions by other warp models using different
tracers, such as dust, HI and stellar components of our Galaxy.

First, a summary of the model theory of sheaves, adapted to the metric case, is

metric sheaves appeared in the form of Conference Proceedings. We provide a
version of those results, for the sake of completeness, and then build metric
sheaves for physical systems in the second part of the paper. Specifically,
metric sheaves for quantum mechanical systems with pure point and continuous
spectra are constructed. In the former case, every fiber is a finite projective
Hilbert space determined by the family of invariant subspaces of a given
operator with pure point spectrum, and we also consider unitary transformations
in a finite-dimensional space. For an operator with continuous spectrum, every
fiber is a two sorted structure of subsets of the Schwartz space of rapidly
decreasing functions that includes imperfect representations of position and
momentum states. The imperfection character is parametrically determined by the
elements on the base space and refined in the generic model. Position and
momentum operators find a simple representation in every fiber as well as their
corresponding unitary operators. These results follow after recasting the
algebraic properties of the integral transformations frequently invoked in the
description of quantum mechanical systems with continuous spectra. Finally, we
illustrate how this construction permits the calculation of the quantum

The source can be a nebula inflated and heated by an intermittent outflow from
a magnetar --- a neutron star powered by its magnetic (rather than rotational)
energy. The object is young and frequently liberating energy in magnetic flares
driven by accelerated ambipolar diffusion in the neutron star core, feeding the
nebula and producing bright millisecond bursts. The particle number in the
nebula is consistent with ion ejecta from giant flares. The nebula may also
contain the freeze-out of electron-positron pairs $N_\pm\sim 10^{51}$ created
months after the neutron star birth; the same mechanism offers an explanation
for $N_\pm$ in the Crab nebula. The persistent source around FRB 121102 is
likely heated by magnetic dissipation and internal waves excited by the
magnetar ejecta. The volumetric heating by waves explains the nebula's enormous
efficiency in producing radio emission. The repeating radio bursts are
suggested to occur much closer to the magnetar, whose flaring magnetosphere
drives ultrarelativistic internal shocks into the magnetar wind. The shocks are
mediated by Larmor rotation that forms a GHz maser with the observed ms
duration. Furthermore, the flare ejecta can become charge-starved and then
convert to electromagnetic waves.

action recognition at the beginning. Two key questions about the use of scene
flow for action recognition are addressed: how to organize the scene flow
vectors and how to represent the long term dynamics of videos based on scene
flow. In order to calculate the scene flow correctly on the available datasets,
we propose an effective self-calibration method to align the RGB and depth data
spatially without knowledge of the camera parameters. Based on the scene flow
vectors, we propose a new representation, namely, Scene Flow to Action Map
(SFAM), that describes several long term spatio-temporal dynamics for action
recognition. We adopt a channel transform kernel to transform the scene flow
vectors to an optimal color space analogous to RGB. This transformation takes
better advantage of the trained ConvNets models over ImageNet. Experimental
results indicate that this new representation can surpass the performance of
state-of-the-art methods on two large public datasets.

scaffolding network embodies an incremental learning approach that is
formulated as a teacher-student network architecture to teach machines how to
understand text and do reasoning. The key to our computational scaffolding
approach is the interactions between the teacher and the student through
sequential questioning. The student observes each sentence in the text
incrementally, and it uses an attention-based neural net to discover and
register the key information in relation to its current memory. Meanwhile, the
teacher asks questions about the observed text, and the student network gets
rewarded by correctly answering these questions. The entire network is updated
continually using reinforcement learning. Our experimental results on synthetic

state-of-the-art methods but also learns to do reasoning in a scalable way even
with little human generated input.

to $8$th order using an effective model. Generally higher order
susceptibilities will have more sign changes and larger magnitude, thus should
give more information about the presence and location of the conjectured QCD
critical end point (CEP). Two cases are studied, one with the CEP and one being
crossover phase transition throughout the QCD phase diagram. It is found that a
rapid crossover transition can also give similar sign pattern as the case with
the CEP and yield large signal. We propose that using several kinds of ions for
collision to search for a wider range on the QCD phase diagram may help.

propose for the relativistic jets with small viewing angles the non-uniform MHD

in computer visions, including multi-object recognition and automatic image
tagging. In these applications, additional information such as bounding-boxes,
image captions and descriptions is often available during training phrase,
which is referred as privileged information (PI). However, as existing works on
learning using PI only consider instance-level PI (privileged instances), they
fail to make use of bag-level PI (privileged bags) available in MIML learning.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-stream fully convolutional network,
named MIML-FCN+, unified by a novel PI loss to solve the problem of MIML
learning with privileged bags. Compared to the previous works on PI, the
proposed MIML-FCN+ utilizes the readily available privileged bags, instead of
hard-to-obtain privileged instances, making the system more general and
practical in real world applications. As the proposed PI loss is convex and SGD
compatible and the framework itself is a fully convolutional network, MIML-FCN+
can be easily integrated with state of-the-art deep learning networks.
Moreover, the flexibility of convolutional layers allows us to exploit
structured correlations among instances to facilitate more effective training
and testing. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed MIML-FCN+, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in the application of multi-object recognition.

rates which follow a local detailed balance condition with respect to change in
energy per hopping event. Based on this model, we show that the stall force,
the mean external force corresponding to zero mean cargo velocity, is
completely independent of the details of the interactions and is, therefore,
always equal to the sum of the stall forces of the individual motors. This
exact result is arrived on the basis of a simple assumption: the (macroscopic)
state of stall of the cargo is analogous to a state of thermodynamic
equilibrium, and is characterized by vanishing net probability current between
any two microstates, with the latter specified by motor positions relative to
the cargo. The corresponding probability distribution of the microstates under

numerical simulations, carried out using specific forms of interaction

lattices is presented. We cover longitudinal and transverse vibrations of
chains and out-of-plane vibrations of two-dimensional lattices with
interactions of an arbitrary number of neighbors. Motion of each particle is
governed by a single scalar equation and therefore the notion ""scalar lattice""
is used. Evolution of initial temperature field in an infinite lattice is
investigated. An exact equation describing the evolution is derived.
Continualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is
carried out. The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The
solution shows that the kinetic temperature is represented as the sum of two
terms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior. At
short times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by
redistribution of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process).
Characteristic time of this process is of order of ten periods of atomic
vibrations. At large times, changes of the temperature are caused by ballistic
heat transfer (slow process). The temperature field is represented as a
superposition of waves having the shape of initial temperature distribution and
propagating with group velocities dependent on the wave vector. Expressions
describing fast and slow processes are invariant with respect to substitution
$t$ by $-t$. However examples considered in the paper demonstrate that these
processes are irreversible. Numerical simulations show that presented theory
describes the evolution of temperature field at short and large time scales

significantly associated with a class variable is of high relevance in fields
such as Genetics or Healthcare, but the combinatorial explosion of the
candidate space makes this problem extremely challenging in terms of
computational efficiency and proper correction for multiple testing. While
recent progress has been made regarding this challenge for binary features, we
here present the first solution for continuous features. We propose an
algorithm which overcomes the combinatorial explosion of the search space of
higher-order interactions by deriving a lower bound on the p-value for each
interaction, which enables us to massively prune interactions that can never
reach significance and to thereby gain more statistical power. In our
experiments, our approach efficiently detects all significant interactions in a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

Despite
well-designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. How do
robots measure unexpected events? Many do not. Most robots are driven by the
sense-plan act paradigm, however more recently robots are undergoing a
sense-plan-act-verify paradigm. In this work, we present a principled
methodology to bootstrap online robot introspection for contact tasks. In
effect, we are trying to enable the robot to answer the question: what did I
do? Is my behavior as expected or not? To this end, we analyze noisy wrench
data and postulate that the latter inherently contains patterns that can be
effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is generated by
segmenting and encoding the data. When the wrench information represents a
sequence of sub-tasks, we can think of the vocabulary forming a sentence (set
of words with grammar rules) for a given sub-task; allowing the latter to be
uniquely represented. The grammar, which can also include unexpected events,
was classified in offline and online scenarios as well as for simulated and
real robot experiments. Multiclass Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used
offline, while online probabilistic SVMs were are used to give temporal
confidence to the introspection result. The contribution of our work is the
presentation of a generalizable online semantic scheme that enables a robot to
understand its high-level state whether nominal or abnormal. It is shown to
work in offline and online scenarios for a particularly challenging contact
task: snap assemblies. We perform the snap assembly in one-arm simulated and
real one-arm experiments and a simulated two-arm experiment. This verification
mechanism can be used by high-level planners or reasoning systems to enable
intelligent failure recovery or determine the next most optima manipulation

new dynamics into the lower grid layers. At the same time, distributed
resources will have to contribute to stabilize the grid against these
fluctuations in the future. In this paper, we model a system of distributed
resources as oscillators on a tree-like, lossy power grid and its ability to
withstand desynchronization from localized intermittent renewable infeed.
  We find a remarkable interplay of network structure and the position of the
node at which the fluctuations are fed in. An important precondition for our
findings is the presence of losses in distribution grids. Then, the most
network central node splits the network into branches with different influence
on network stability. Troublemakers, i.e. nodes at which fluctuations are
especially exciting the grid, tend to be downstream branches with high net
power outflow. For low coupling strength, we also find branches of nodes
vulnerable to fluctuations anywhere in the network. These network regions can
be predicted at high confidence using an eigenvector based network measure
taking the turbulent nature of perturbations into account.
  While we focus here on tree-like networks, the observed effects also appear,
albeit less pronounced, for weakly meshed grids. On the other hand the observed
effects disappear for lossless power grids often studied in the complex systems
literature.

(MDC), which classically implies the coexistence of (commuting) dynamical flows
in several independent variables for one and the same dependent variable. This
property holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete
ones defined in discrete space-time. Possibly the simplest example in the
discrete case is that of a linear quadrilateral lattice equation, which can be
viewed as a linearised version of the well-known lattice potential Korteweg-de
Vries (KdV) equation. In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is
non-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system. The Lagrangian aspects of
such equations, and their nonlinear analogues, has led to the notion of
Lagrangian multiform structures, where the Lagrangians are no longer scalar
functions (or volume forms) but genuine forms in a multidimensional space of
independent variables. The variational principle involves variations not only
with respect to the field variables, but also with respect to the geometry in
the space of independent variables. In this paper we consider a quantum
analogue of this new variational principle by means of quantum propagators (or
equivalently Feynman path integrals). In the case of quadratic Lagrangians
these can be evaluated in terms of Gaussian integrals. We study also periodic
reductions of the lattice leading to discrete multi-time dynamical commuting
mappings, the simplest example of which is the discrete harmonic oscillator,
which surprisingly reveals a rich integrable structure behind it. On the basis
of this study we propose a new quantum variational principle in terms of
multiform path integrals.

features in the 90-60 A wavelength region of EVE do provide useful
N_e-diagnostics at relatively low flare densities (N_e ~ 10^11-10^12 cm^-3).
Here we investigate if additional highly ionised Fe line ratios in the EVE
90-160 A range may be reliably employed as N_e-diagnostics. In particular, the
potential for such diagnostics to provide density estimates for high N_e
(~10^13 cm^-3) flare plasmas is assessed. Our study employs EVE spectra for
X-class flares, combined with observations of highly active late-type stars
from the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite plus experimental data
for well-diagnosed tokamak plasmas, both of which are similar in wavelength
coverage and spectral resolution to those from EVE. Several ratios are
identified in EVE data which yield consistent values of electron density,
including Fe XX 113.35/121.85 and Fe XXII 114.41/135.79, with confidence in
their reliability as N_e-diagnostics provided by the EUVE and tokamak results.
These ratios also allow the determination of density in solar flare plasmas up
to values of ~10^13 cm^-3.

The key question is: Is it possible to build a completely reversible computer?
A closer look into the internal aspects of the reversible computing as well as
the external constraints such as the second law of thermodynamics has
demonstrated that several difficulties would have to be solved before
reversible computer is being built. It is shown that a conventional reversible
computer would require energy for setting up the reversible inputs from
irreversible signals, for the reading out of the reversible outputs, for the
transport of the information between logic elements and finally for the control

efficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of
supernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the
posterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test
data-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy
to a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that
interesting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental
abundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For
the first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE
modeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account
for different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %
explodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain
the incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy
application shows persistent discrepancies between predicted and observed
abundances for some elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These
cannot be remedied by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an
indication for missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy should be a powerful
tool to confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex

the erosion, rather than the growth of WDs. Rapid hydrogen accretion does lead
to growth of a helium layer, due to both decreased degeneracy and the
inhibition of mixing of the accreted hydrogen with the underlying WD. However,
until recently, simulations of helium-accreting WDs all claimed to show the
explosive ejection of a helium envelope once it exceeded $\sim 10^{-1}\, \rm

have grown substantially. We demonstrate that the WD in the symbiotic nova RS

can be traced to the structure of the tridiagonal matrices representing the
symmetry-adapted pendular Hamiltonian, as well as enabled us to identify many
more -- forty in total to be exact -- analytic solutions. Furthermore, an
analogous analysis of the hyperbolic counterpart of the planar pendulum, the
Razavy problem, which was shown to be also C-QES [American Journal of Physics
48, 285 (1980)], confirmed that it is anti-isospectral with the pendular
eigenproblem. Of key importance for both eigenproblems proved to be the
topological index $\kappa$, as it determines the loci of the intersections
(genuine and avoided) of the eigenenergy surfaces spanned by the dimensionless
interaction parameters $\eta$ and $\zeta$. It also encapsulates the conditions
under which analytic solutions to the two eigenproblems obtain and provides the
number of analytic solutions. At a given $\kappa$, the anti-isospectrality
occurs for single states only (i.e., not for doublets), like C-QES holds solely
for integer values of $\kappa$, and only occurs for the lowest eigenvalues of
the pendular and Razavy Hamiltonians, with the order of the eigenvalues

a challenge in many research domains. In the context of Multi-agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL), approaches like difference rewards and resource
abstraction have shown promising results in tackling such problems. Resource
abstraction was shown to be an ideal candidate for solving large-scale resource
allocation problems in a fully decentralized manner. However, its performance
and applicability strongly depends on some, until now, undocumented
assumptions. Two of the main congestion benchmark problems considered in the
literature are: the Beach Problem Domain and the Traffic Lane Domain. In both
settings the highest system utility is achieved when overcrowding one resource
and keeping the rest at optimum capacity. We analyse how abstract grouping can
promote this behaviour and how feasible it is to apply this approach in a
real-world domain (i.e., what assumptions need to be satisfied and what
knowledge is necessary). We introduce a new test problem, the Road Network
Domain (RND), where the resources are no longer independent, but rather part of
a network (e.g., road network), thus choosing one path will also impact the
load on other paths having common road segments. We demonstrate the application
of state-of-the-art MARL methods for this new congestion model and analyse
their performance. RND allows us to highlight an important limitation of
resource abstraction and show that the difference rewards approach manages to
better capture and inform the agents about the dynamics of the environment.

established by creating collisions between solitons with different number and

trapped electron population accompanying each of the solitons are exchanged

electron holes accompanying solitons contradicts the theory about the electron
holes interaction developed based on kinetic theory. They also show behaviors

features, we find that the cubic couplings of the curvature perturbation can be
expressed in terms of the bispectrum in two specific momentum configurations,
for example local and equilateral. This allows us to derive consistency
relations among different bispectrum shapes, which in principle could be tested
in future CMB surveys. Furthermore, based on the form of the consistency
relations, we construct new two-parameter templates for features that include
all the known shapes.

near-infrared wavelengths in planar geometries involving two slabs supporting
far-apart surface plasmon polaritons and separated by a nonlinear $\chi^{(3)}$
medium that is irradiated by externally incident light. We study multiple
geometric and material configurations and different classes of interveening

nonlinear materials---designed to resonantly enhance the interaction of the
incident light with thermal slab resonances. We find that even when the entire
system is in thermodynamic equilibrium (at room temperature) and under typical
drive intensities $\sim\mathrm{W}/\mu\mathrm{m}^2$, the resulting upconversion
rates can approach and even exceed thermal flux rates achieved in typical
symmetric and non-equilibrium configurations of vacuum-separated slabs. The
proposed nonlinear scheme could potentially be exploited to achieve thermal
cooling and refrigeration at the nanoscale, and to actively control heat
transfer between materials with dramatically different resonant responses.

of this article reveals that each such discretization method achieves at most a

need of the development of other more sophisticated approximation methods which
are capable to solve CIR processes in the strong sense in a reasonable

stability of the inflaton condensate in $\alpha$-attractor inflation. We show
that the stability of the condensate depends upon the value of $\alpha$. For
the T-model with $n = 1$, we find that it is unstable for $\alpha \lesssim
10^{-4}$. In this case it is expected that inflation will be followed by an
oscillon-dominated era.

world and reason about our uncertainty, but there is a need for better
procedures to accurately encode its complexity. One way to do so is through
compositional models, which are formed by combining blocks consisting of
simpler models. One can increase the complexity of the compositional model by
either stacking more blocks or by using a not-so-simple model as a building
block. This thesis is an example of the latter. One first aim is to expand the
choice of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) blocks for constructing tractable
compositional models. So far, most of the models that have a Bayesian
nonparametric component use a Dirichlet Process or a Pitman-Yor process because
of the availability of tractable and compact representations. This thesis shows
how to overcome certain intractabilities in order to obtain analogous compact
representations for the class of Poisson-Kingman priors which includes the
Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes.
  A major impediment to the widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric building
blocks is that inference is often costly, intractable or difficult to carry
out. This is an active research area since dealing with the model's infinite
dimensional component forbids the direct use of standard simulation-based
methods. The main contribution of this thesis is a variety of inference schemes
that tackle this problem: Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo
methods, which are exact inference schemes since they target the true
posterior. The contributions of this thesis, in a larger context, provide
general purpose exact inference schemes in the flavour or probabilistic
programming: the user is able to choose from a variety of models, focusing only
on the modelling part. Indeed, if the wide enough class of Poisson-Kingman
priors is used as one of our blocks, this objective is achieved.

processing tasks such image classification. However, the cost for a gain in
accuracy in terms of depth and memory is prohibitive as it requires a higher
number of residual blocks, up to double the initial value. To tackle this
problem, we propose in this paper a way to reduce the redundant information of
the networks. We share the weights of convolutional layers between residual
blocks operating at the same spatial scale. The signal flows multiple times in
the same convolutional layer. The resulting architecture, called ShaResNet,
contains block specific layers and shared layers. These ShaResNet are trained
exactly in the same fashion as the commonly used residual networks. We show, on
the one hand, that they are almost as efficient as their sequential
counterparts while involving less parameters, and on the other hand that they
are more efficient than a residual network with the same number of parameters.
For example, a 152-layer-deep residual network can be reduced to 106
convolutional layers, i.e. a parameter gain of 39\%, while loosing less than
0.2\% accuracy on ImageNet.

dispersion which exhibits a gap at $2k_F$ and a finite-momentum roton minimum.
Such features occur at energies far above the finite volume excitation gap,
vanish slowly as $1/L$ for fixed spinon number, and can persist to the
thermodynamic limit at fixed spinon density. Features such as the $2k_F$ gap
also persist to multi-particle excitation continua. Our results show that
excitations in the finite system can behave in a qualitatively different manner
to analogous excitations in the thermodynamic limit.
  The Yang-Gaudin Bose gas is also host to multi-spinon bound states, known as
$\Lambda$-strings. We study these excitations both in the thermodynamic limit
under the string hypothesis and in finite size systems where string deviations
are taken into account. In the zero-temperature limit we present a simple
relation between the length $n$ $\Lambda$-string dressed energies
$\epsilon_n(\lambda)$ and the dressed energy $\epsilon(k)$. We solve the
Yang-Yang-Takahashi equations numerically and compare to the analytical
solution obtained under the strong couple expansion, revealing that the length
$n$ $\Lambda$-string dressed energy is Lorentzian over a wide range of real
string centers $\lambda$ in the vicinity of $\lambda = 0$. We then examine the
finite size effects present in the dispersion of the two-spinon bound states by
numerically solving the Bethe ansatz equations with string deviations.

spatial datasets covering the globe become available. Statistical analysis of
such data is challenging. This article proposes a semiparametric approach to
model large or massive spatial datasets. In particular, a Gaussian process with
additive components is proposed, with its covariance structure consisting of
two components: one component is flexible without assuming a specific
parametric covariance function but is able to achieve dimension reduction; the
other is parametric and simultaneously induces sparsity. The inference
algorithm for parameter estimation and spatial prediction is devised. The
resulting spatial prediction methodology that we call fused Gaussian process
(FGP), is applied to simulated data and a massive satellite dataset. The
results demonstrate the computational and inferential benefits of FGP over
competing methods and show that FGP is robust against model misspecification
and captures spatial nonstationarity. The supplemental materials are available

In this study, we propose a novel hashing method for large-scale image

hashing network is designed under the following three principles: 1) more
discriminative representations for image retrieval; 2) minimum quantization
loss between the original real-valued feature descriptors and the learned hash
codes; 3) maximum information entropy for the learned hash codes. Extensive

unused pilot sequence. The jamming channel estimate is used to constructed
linear receive filters that reject the impact of the jamming signal. The
performance of the proposed scheme is analytically evaluated using asymptotic

the optimal power allocation are also studied. Numerical results are provided

binary star systems. Tidal interactions may have played an important role in
the evolution of the spin-orbit angle. In this study, we investigate the tidal
interactions in spin-orbit misaligned systems. In particular, we focus on the
tidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be
important for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the
orbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual
precession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum
vector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal
interactions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations
describing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into
account the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and
in a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited
on top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The
tidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be
several orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal
components if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial
waves. Therefore, it is possible that the spin-orbit misalignment undergoes
much more rapid decay than the orbital decay in hot Jupiter systems owing to
the enhanced dissipation of the obliquity tide.

explained in the context of a Turing instability, where patterns emerge due to
two locally interacting components that diffuse with different speeds in the
medium. Turing patterns are multistable, such that many different patterns with
different wavelengths are possible for the same set of parameters, but in a
given region typically only one such wavelength is dominant. In the Turing
instability region, random initial conditions will mostly lead to a wavelength
that is similar to that of the leading eigenvector that arises from the linear
stability analysis, but when venturing beyond, little is known about the
pattern that will emerge. Using dryland vegetation as a case study, we use
different models of drylands ecosystems to study the wavelength pattern that is

that closely match their projected 3D counterparts. Transverse stellar mass
gradients are measured in projected slices of thickness 75 Mpc between $0.5< z
<0.9$, showing that the most massive galaxies are statistically closer to their
neighbouring filament. At fixed stellar mass, passive galaxies are also found
closer to their filament while active star-forming galaxies statistically lie
further away. The contributions of nodes and local density are removed from
these gradients to highlight the specific role played by the geometry of the

clearly demonstrating that proximity to a filament is not equivalent to
proximity to an over-density. These findings are in agreement with gradients

  Grouping",,,"10.1016/j.scs.2018.02.013",,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Big data collection practices using Internet of Things (IoT) pervasive
technologies are often privacy-intrusive and result in surveillance, profiling,
and discriminatory actions over citizens that in turn undermine the
participation of citizens to the development of sustainable smart cities.
Nevertheless, real-time data analytics and aggregate information from IoT
devices open up tremendous opportunities for managing smart city
infrastructures. The privacy-enhancing aggregation of distributed sensor data,
such as residential energy consumption or traffic information, is the research
focus of this paper. Citizens have the option to choose their privacy level by
reducing the quality of the shared data at a cost of a lower accuracy in data
analytics services. A baseline scenario is considered in which IoT sensor data
are shared directly with an untrustworthy central aggregator. A grouping
mechanism is introduced that improves privacy by sharing data aggregated first
at a group level compared as opposed to sharing data directly to the central
aggregator. Group-level aggregation obfuscates sensor data of individuals, in a
similar fashion as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption schemes,
thus inference of privacy-sensitive information from single sensors becomes
computationally harder compared to the baseline scenario. The proposed system
is evaluated using real-world data from two smart city pilot projects. Privacy
under grouping increases, while preserving the accuracy of the baseline
scenario. Intra-group influences of privacy by one group member on the other
ones are measured and fairness on privacy is found to be maximized between
group members with similar privacy choices. Several grouping strategies are
compared. Grouping by proximity of privacy choices provides the highest privacy
gains. The implications of the strategy on the design of incentives mechanisms
are discussed.

the ground as the temperature exchange medium. GHP systems are becoming more
and more popular in recent years due to their high efficiency. Conventional
control schemes of GHP systems are mainly designed for buildings with a single
thermal zone. For large buildings with multiple thermal zones, those control
schemes either lose efficiency or become costly to implement requiring a lot of
real-time measurement, communication and computation. In this paper, we focus
on developing energy efficient control schemes for GHP systems in buildings
with multiple zones. We present a thermal dynamic model of a building equipped
with a GHP system for floor heating/cooling and formulate the GHP system
control problem as a resource allocation problem with the objective to maximize
user comfort in different zones and to minimize the building energy
consumption. We then propose real-time distributed algorithms to solve the
control problem. Our distributed multi-zone control algorithms are scalable and
do not need to measure or predict any exogenous disturbances such as the
outdoor temperature and indoor heat gains. Thus, it is easy to implement them
in practice. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
control schemes.

central and most long-standing riddles of stellar astrophysics. A solution is
crucial for deciphering the SN phenomenon, for predicting observable signals
such as light curves and spectra, nucleosynthesis, neutrinos, and gravitational
waves, for defining the role of SNe in the evolution of galaxies, and for
explaining the birth conditions and properties of neutron stars (NSs) and
stellar-mass black holes. Since the formation of such compact remnants releases
over hundred times more energy in neutrinos than the SN in the explosion,
neutrinos can be the decisive agents for powering the SN outburst. According to
the standard paradigm of the neutrino-driven mechanism, the energy transfer by
the intense neutrino flux to the medium behind the stagnating core-bounce
shock, assisted by violent hydrodynamic mass motions (sometimes subsumed by the
term ""turbulence""), revives the outward shock motion and thus initiates the SN
blast. Because of the weak coupling of neutrinos in the region of this energy
deposition, detailed, multidimensional hydrodynamic models including neutrino
transport and a wide variety of physics are needed to assess the viability of
the mechanism. Owing to advanced numerical codes and increasing supercomputer
power, considerable progress has been achieved in our understanding of the
physical processes that have to act in concert for the success of
neutrino-driven explosions. First studies begin to reveal observational
implications and avenues to test the theoretical picture by data from
individual SNe and SN remnants but also from population-integrated observables.
While models will be further refined, a real breakthrough is expected through
the next Galactic core-collapse SN, when neutrinos and gravitational waves can
be used to probe the conditions deep inside the dying star. (abridged)

contribution, we ask the question of how people actually respond to ordinal
scales. The main problem observed is that users tend to be volatile in their
choices, i.e. complex cognitions do not always lead to the same decisions, but
to distributions of possible decision outputs. This human uncertainty may
sometimes have quite an impact on common data mining approaches and thus, the
question of effective modelling this so called human uncertainty emerges
naturally.
  Our contribution introduces two different approaches for modelling the human
uncertainty of user responses. In doing so, we develop techniques in order to
measure this uncertainty at the level of user inputs as well as the level of
user cognition. With support of comprehensive user experiments and large-scale
simulations, we systematically compare both methodologies along with their
implications for personalisation approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
significant amounts of users do submit something completely different (action)
than they really have in mind (cognition). Moreover, we demonstrate that
statistically sound evidence with respect to algorithm assessment becomes quite
hard to realise, especially when explicit rankings shall be built.

of a sample of 121 local luminous infrared galaxies and report the fluxes of
the CO $J$ to $J$-1 rotational transitions for $4 \leqslant J \leqslant 13$,
the [NII] 205 um line, the [CI] lines at 609 and 370 um, as well as additional
and usually fainter lines. The CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs)
presented here are consistent with our earlier work, which was based on a
smaller sample, that calls for two distinct molecular gas components in
general: (i) a cold component, which emits CO lines primarily at $J \lesssim 4$
and likely represents the same gas phase traced by CO (1-0), and (ii) a warm
component, which dominates over the mid-$J$ regime ($4 < J < 10$) and is
intimately related to current star formation. We present evidence that the CO
line emission associated with an active galactic nucleus is significant only at
$J > 10$. The flux ratios of the two [CI] lines imply modest excitation
temperatures of 15 to 30 K; the [CI] 370 um line scales more linearly in flux
with CO (4-3) than with CO (7-6). These findings suggest that the [CI] emission
is predominately associated with the gas component defined in (i) above. Our
analysis of the stacked spectra in different far-infrared (FIR) color bins
reveals an evolution of the SLED of the rotational transitions of water vapor
as a function of the FIR color in a direction consistent with infrared photon
pumping.

changing magnetism are inefficient or destructive to the magnetic material.
Hence there is a need for innovation in this field. Here we report
high-performance magnetic control of a gas-responsive single-molecule magnet

significantly changed according to the gas environment it is in and some of the
magnetic states can be reversibly transformed or coexistent in the SMM through
artificial control. More importantly, the monocrystalline structure of the SMM
remains unchanged during the transformation process except for slight change of
the lattice constant. Thus, this work opens up new insights into the
stimuli-responsive magnetic materials which have great prospects for
application in artificial design magnetic network and also highlight their
