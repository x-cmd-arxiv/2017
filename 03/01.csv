  Boundary Trees",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nearest neighbor (kNN) methods have been gaining popularity in recent years
in light of advances in hardware and efficiency of algorithms. There is a
plethora of methods to choose from today, each with their own advantages and
disadvantages. One requirement shared between all kNN based methods is the need
for a good representation and distance measure between samples.
  We introduce a new method called differentiable boundary tree which allows
for learning deep kNN representations. We build on the recently proposed
boundary tree algorithm which allows for efficient nearest neighbor
classification, regression and retrieval. By modelling traversals in the tree
as stochastic events, we are able to form a differentiable cost function which
is associated with the tree's predictions. Using a deep neural network to
transform the data and back-propagating through the tree allows us to learn
good representations for kNN methods.
  We demonstrate that our method is able to learn suitable representations
allowing for very efficient trees with a clearly interpretable structure.

This is a decision tree ensemble approach, with much less hyper-parameters than
deep neural networks, and its model complexity can be automatically determined
in a data-dependent way. Experiments show that its performance is quite robust
to hyper-parameter settings, such that in most cases, even across different

the same default setting. This study opens the door of deep learning based on

where a network of magnetic domains is considered and each domain has a
constant magnetic field. We investigate a more general model where a network of
domains is still assumed, but each domain has a helical magnetic field. We find
that the asymptotic behavior does not depend on the configuration of magnetic
fields. Remarkably, we analytically obtain the asymptotic values of the
variance of polarization in the conventional model. When the helicity is small,
we show that there appears the damped oscillating behavior in the early stage
of evolution. Moreover, we see that the constraints on the axion coupling and
the cosmological magnetic fields using polarization observations are affected
by the magnetic field configuration. This is because the different transient
behavior of polarization dynamics is caused by the different magnetic field
configuration. Recently, [C. Wang and D. Lai, J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 06

peculiarly. However, our helical model gives much closer predictions to the

product on the corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The descent for $p$
gives rise to an element $\omega=\omega_3 + \omega_2 + \omega_1 + \omega_0$ of
mixed degree. The 3-form part $\omega_3$ is the Chern-Simons form. The 2-form

  In this paper, we give a new interpretation of the low degree components
$\omega_1$ and $\omega_0$. Our main tool is the universal differential calculus
on free Lie algebras due to Kontsevich. We establish a correspondence between
solutions of the first Kashiwara-Vergne equation in Lie theory and universal
solutions of the descent equation for the second Chern class $p$. In more
detail, we define a 1-cocycle $C$ which maps automorphisms of the free Lie
algebra to one forms. A solution of the Kashiwara-Vergne equation $F$ is mapped
to $\omega_1=C(F)$. Furthermore, the component $\omega_0$ is related to the
associator corresponding to $F$. It is surprising that while $F$ and $\Phi$
satisfy the highly non-linear twist and pentagon equations, the elements
$\omega_1$ and $\omega_0$ solve the linear descent equation.

We report on data from this chamber for thermodynamic ""Seitz"" thresholds from
4.2 to 15.0 keV. The observed single- and multiple-bubble rates when exposed to
a $^{252}$Cf neutron source indicate that, for an 8.3-keV thermodynamic
threshold, the minimum nuclear recoil energy required to nucleate a bubble is
$19\pm6$ keV (1$\sigma$ uncertainty). This is consistent with the observed
scintillation spectrum for bubble-nucleating events. We see no evidence for
bubble nucleation by gamma rays at any of the thresholds studied, setting a 90%
C.L. upper limit of $6.3\times10^{-7}$ bubbles per gamma interaction at a
4.2-keV thermodynamic threshold. This indicates stronger gamma discrimination

The ME coupling mechanism is an interaction between the external electric field

the spin modulation wave vectors resulting in the distortion of the SkL and the
$E$-field induced shift in energy. Due to the relativistic smallness of ME

the skyrmion phase is taken into account perturbatively. The shift in energy
can be either positive or negative, -- depending on the direction of electric

compression waves at an interface that is coupled to a viscous bulk medium. The
fractional character of the differential equation comes from the fact that the
effective thickness of the bulk layer that is coupled to the interface is
frequency dependent. The nonlinearity arises from the nonlinear dependence of
the interface compressibility on the local compression, which is obtained from
experimental measurements and reflects a phase transition at the interface.
Numerical solutions of our nonlinear fractional theory reproduce several
experimental key features of surface waves in phospholipid monolayers at the
air-water interface without freely adjustable fitting parameters. In
particular, the propagation length of the surface wave abruptly increases at a
threshold excitation amplitude. The wave velocity is found to be of the order
of 40 cm/s both in experiments and theory and slightly increases as a function
of the excitation amplitude. Nonlinear acoustic switching effects in membranes
are thus shown to arise purely based on intrinsic membrane properties, namely
the presence of compressibility nonlinearities that accompany phase transitions

central dynamics can be fitted if the IMF is assumed non-universal. The results
can be interpreted with a IMF lighter than a standard Chabrier at low-$\sigma$,

acceptable, stellar M/L in EG theory, if compared with the DM-based NFW model

  This work's contribution is threefold. Firstly, we provide directly
computable closed-form expressions for quantities appearing in the EM algorithm

considerable computational speedups have been gained. Secondly, we prove
convergence to a single set of parameters under very weak conditions (for the
TPM problem). Finally, we provide a numerical benchmark of our results against
other known algorithms, in particular, on several problems related to credit
risk. The EM algorithm we propose, padded with the new formulas (and error
criteria), outperforms other known algorithms in several metrics, in
particular, with much less overestimation of probabilities of default in higher

to a huge amount of unlabelled data that are needed to capture the underlying
manifold structure for better classification. Since computing the pairwise
similarity between the training data is prohibitively expensive in most kinds
of input data, currently, there is no general ready-to-use semi-supervised
learning method/tool available for learning with tens of millions or more data
points. In this paper, we adopted the idea of two low-rank label propagation
algorithms, GLNP (Global Linear Neighborhood Propagation) and Kernel Nystr\""om
Approximation, and implemented the parallelized version of the two algorithms
accelerated with Nesterov's accelerated projected gradient descent for Big-data
Label Propagation (BigLP).
  The parallel algorithms are tested on five real datasets ranging from 7000 to
10,000,000 in size and a simulation dataset of 100,000,000 samples. In the
experiments, the implementation can scale up to datasets with 100,000,000
samples and hundreds of features and the algorithms also significantly improved
the prediction accuracy when only a very small percentage of the data is
labeled. The results demonstrate that the BigLP implementation is highly
scalable to big data and effective in utilizing the unlabeled data for
semi-supervised learning.

problems. However, existing multi-agent RL methods typically scale poorly in
the problem size. Therefore, a key challenge is to translate the success of
deep learning on single-agent RL to the multi-agent setting. A major stumbling
block is that independent Q-learning, the most popular multi-agent RL method,
introduces nonstationarity that makes it incompatible with the experience
replay memory on which deep Q-learning relies. This paper proposes two methods
that address this problem: 1) using a multi-agent variant of importance
sampling to naturally decay obsolete data and 2) conditioning each agent's
value function on a fingerprint that disambiguates the age of the data sampled
from the replay memory. Results on a challenging decentralised variant of
StarCraft unit micromanagement confirm that these methods enable the successful
combination of experience replay with multi-agent RL.

We subsequently deepen the relationship by showing how a single model can be
used to represent both a policy and the corresponding softmax state values,
eliminating the need for a separate critic. The experimental evaluation
demonstrates that PCL significantly outperforms strong actor-critic and

Lipschitz Interpolation are fast and numerically robust approaches to
nonparametric machine learning that have been proposed to be utilised in the

presupposed Lipschitz properties in order to compute inferences over unobserved
function values. Unfortunately, most of these approaches rely on exact
knowledge about the input space metric as well as about the Lipschitz constant.
Furthermore, existing techniques to estimate the Lipschitz constants from the
data are not robust to noise or seem to be ad-hoc and typically are decoupled
from the ultimate learning and prediction task. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an approach for optimising parameters of the presupposed metrics by
minimising validation set prediction errors. To avoid poor performance due to
local minima, we propose to utilise Lipschitz properties of the optimisation
objective to ensure global optimisation success. The resulting approach is a

(a) detecting a target when the query response is a direction to an

study for detecting two targets in graphs and we identify sufficient conditions

economic scenario. In this case, they can largely reduce their total capital
requirements via appropriate transfer agreements within a network structure

regulation. We prove several versions of such a result for general distortion
risk measures of V@R-type, explicitly construct suitable allocations of the

cannot completely eliminate this problem. Capital regulation should thus be

have been observed to correspond to dark temporal structures, and theoretically
explained as interlocked switching waves (also known as domain walls or

frequency combs has however so far eluded direct experimental observation. Here
we use a closely related system - a synchronously driven optical fibre ring
resonator - to experimentally study the dynamics of deterministically excited
switching waves. We measure the switching wave velocities across broad
parameter regions, and observe clear signatures of interlocking behaviour
leading to the formation of persisting dark pulses. Our experimental findings
are in good agreement with simulations of the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever
equation, and strongly support the nature of normal-dispersion microresonator
frequency combs suggested in the literature.

Recall that, given a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the Eulerian idempotent is a
canonical projection from the enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ to
$\mathfrak{g}$. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff product and the Magnus expansion
can both be expressed in terms of the Eulerian idempotent, which makes it
interesting to establish explicit formulas for the latter. We show how to
reduce the computation of the Eulerian idempotent to the computation of a
logarithm in a certain pre-Lie algebra of planar, binary, rooted trees. The
problem of finding formulas for the pre-Lie logarithm, which is interesting in
its own right -- being related to operad theory, numerical analysis and
renormalization -- is addressed using techniques inspired by umbral calculus.
As a consequence of our analysis, we find formulas both for the Eulerian
idempotent and the pre-Lie logarithm in terms of the combinatorics of trees.

large scales, which provides a model of late-time cosmic acceleration in the
absence of the cosmological constant and with the same number of free
parameters as in standard cosmology. The model is motivated by adding to the
gravity sector an extra spin-2 field interacting nonlocally with the physical
metric coupled to matter. The form of the nonlocal interaction is inspired by
the simplest form of the Deser-Woodard (DW) model, $\alpha R\frac{1}{\Box}R$,
with one of the Ricci scalars being replaced by a constant $m^{2}$, and gravity
is therefore modified in the infrared by adding a simple term of the form
$m^2\frac{1}{\Box}R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert term. We study cosmic expansion
histories, and demonstrate that the new model can provide background expansions
consistent with observations if $m$ is of the order of the Hubble expansion
rate today, in contrast to the simple DW model with no viable cosmology. The
model is best fit by $w_0\sim-1.075$ and $w_a\sim0.045$. We also compare the
cosmology of the model to that of Maggiore and Mancarella (MM),
$m^2R\frac{1}{\Box^2}R$, and demonstrate that the viable cosmic histories
follow the standard-model evolution more closely compared to the MM model. We
further demonstrate that the proposed model possesses the same number of
physical degrees of freedom as in GR. Finally, we discuss the appearance of
ghosts in the local formulation of the model, and argue that they are
unphysical and harmless to the theory, keeping the physical degrees of freedom
healthy.

  Submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dark matter with a non-zero self-interacting cross section ($\sigma_{\rm
SIDM}$) has been posited as a solution to a number of outstanding astrophysical
mysteries. Many studies of merging galaxy clusters have given constraints on
$\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ based on the spatial offset between the member galaxy
population and the dark matter distribution. Assuming $\sigma_{\rm SIDM} = 0$,
how likely is it for us to see the galaxy-DM offset values observed in merging
clusters of galaxies? To answer this question, we formulate a hypothesis test
using data from Illustris, a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation. We select 43
Illustris clusters and their galaxy members at z~0 and examine the accuracy of
commonly used galaxy summary statistics, including kernel-density-estimation
(KDE) luminosity peak, KDE number density peak, shrinking aperture, centroid
and the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use the dark-matter
particles to reproduce commonly adopted methods to identify dark-matter peaks
based on gravitational lensing cluster maps. By analysing each cluster in 768
projections, we determine the optimistic noise floor in the measurements of the
galaxy-DM offsets. We find that the choice of the galaxy summary statistics
affects the inferred offset values substantially, with the BCG and the
luminosity peak giving the tightest 68-th percentile offset levels, $\lesssim$
4 kpc and $\lesssim$ 32 kpc, respectively. Shrinking aperture, number density
and centroid give a large offset scatter of about 50-100 kpc at the 68-th
percentile level, even for clusters with only one dominant mass component. Out
of the 15 reported offsets from observed merging clusters that we examined, 13
of them are consistent with Illustris unrelaxed cluster offsets at the 2-sigma
(95-th percentile) level, i.e. consistent with the hypothesis that $\Lambda$CDM
is the true underlying physical model.

an effective temperature of $1724\pm15$ K, a radius of $1.46\pm0.01$

incorporate any uncertainty on the evolutionary models. Using atmospheric
models, we find an effective temperature of $1700-1800$ K and a surface gravity
of $\log g = 3.5$-$4.0$ [dex] depending upon model. These values agree well
with other publications and with ""hot-start"" predictions from planetary

temperature pseudogap phase of the hole-doped cuprates, including breaking of
one or more of lattice rotation, inversion, or time-reversal symmetries. In the
absence of translational symmetry breaking or topological order, these
conventional order parameters cannot explain the gap in the charged fermion
excitation spectrum in the anti-nodal region. Zhao et al. (1601.01688) and
Jeong et al. (arXiv:1701.06485) have also reported inversion and time-reversal
symmetry breaking in insulating Sr2IrO4 similar to that in the metallic
cuprates, but co-existing with Neel order. We extend an earlier theory of
topological order in insulators and metals, in which the topological order
combines naturally with the breaking of these conventional discrete symmetries.
We find translationally-invariant states with topological order co-existing
with both Ising-nematic order and spontaneous charge currents. The link between
the discrete broken symmetries and the topological-order-induced pseudogap
explains why the broken symmetries do not survive in the confining phases
without a pseudogap at large doping. Our theory also connects to the O(3)
non-linear sigma model and CP1 descriptions of quantum fluctuations of the Neel
order. In this framework, the optimal doping criticality of the cuprates is
primarily associated with the loss of topological order.

BHs have an event horizon --- a one-way membrane through which particles fall
into the BH but cannot exit. However, except for the very few nearby
supermassive BH candidates, our telescopes are unable to resolve and provide a
direct proof of the event horizon. Here, we propose a novel observation that
supports the existence of event horizons around supermassive BH candidates
heavier than 10^{7.5} solar masses. Instead of an event horizon, if the BH
candidate has a hard surface, when a star falls onto the surface, the shocked
baryonic gas will form a radiation pressure supported envelope that shines at
the Eddington luminosity for an extended period of time from months to years.
We show that such emission has already been ruled out by the Pan-STARRS1 3pi

essential tools to help users find most relevant information. The most
heavily-used recommendation frameworks assume user interactions that are

recommendation in social networks, user-item interactions must be modeled as a
complex network of multiple relations, not only a single relation. Recently
research on multi-relational factorization and hybrid recommender models has
shown that using extended meta-paths to capture additional information about
both users and items in the network can enhance the accuracy of recommendations
in such networks. Most of this work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous
networks, and to apply these techniques, weighted relations must be simplified
into binary ones. However, information associated with weighted edges, such as
user ratings, which may be crucial for recommendation, are lost in such
binarization. In this paper, we explore a random walk sampling method in which
the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and apply this

applying standard scientific procedures to clean these datasets. However,
effective management of volunteer behavior also makes a significant
contribution to enhancing data quality. Through a case study of Galaxy Zoo, a
citizen science project set up to generate datasets based on volunteer
classifications of galaxy morphologies, this paper explores how those involved
in running the project manage volunteers. The paper focuses on how methods for
crediting volunteer contributions motivate volunteers to provide higher quality
contributions and to behave in a way that better corresponds to statistical
assumptions made when combining volunteer contributions into datasets. These
methods have made a significant contribution to the success of the project in
securing trust in these datasets, which have been well used by other
scientists. Implications for practice are then presented for citizen science
projects, providing a list of considerations to guide choices regarding how to
credit volunteer contributions to improve the quality and trustworthiness of

to determine the number of clusters to synthetic data and empirical
neuroimaging data to observe the behavior of the criteria across different
types of data set and suitability of the two types of criteria for different
datasets. We found that our method can offer reasonable clustering results that
are useful for dimension reduction. While our numerical results revealed

We found that averaging consensus decisions was substantially more accurate
than aggregating the initial independent opinions. Remarkably, combining as few

recommendation to advertising, and to Web search. Generalized linear models
(logistical regression in particular) have demonstrated stronger performance
than linear models in many applications where rewards are binary. However, most
theoretical analyses on contextual bandits so far are on linear bandits. In
this work, we propose an upper confidence bound based algorithm for generalized
linear contextual bandits, which achieves an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$ regret over
$T$ rounds with $d$ dimensional feature vectors. This regret matches the
minimax lower bound, up to logarithmic terms, and improves on the best previous
result by a $\sqrt{d}$ factor, assuming the number of arms is fixed. A key
component in our analysis is to establish a new, sharp finite-sample confidence
bound for maximum-likelihood estimates in generalized linear models, which may
be of independent interest. We also analyze a simpler upper confidence bound
algorithm, which is useful in practice, and prove it to have optimal regret for
certain cases.

Van der Waals equation of state in the grand canonical ensemble. For the
one-component case the third and fourth virial coefficients are calculated
analytically. It is shown that an adjustment of a single model parameter allows
us to reproduce the third and fourth virial coefficients of the gas of hard
spheres with small deviations from their exact values. A thorough comparison of
the compressibility factor and speed of sound of the developed model with the
one and two component Carnahan-Starling equation of state is made. It is shown
that the model with the induced surface tension is able to reproduce the
results of the Carnahan-Starling equation of state up to the packing fractions
0.2-0.22 at which the usual Van der Waals equation of state is inapplicable. At
higher packing fractions the developed equation of state is softer than the gas
of hard spheres and, hence, it breaks causality in the domain where the
hadronic description is expected to be inapplicable. Using this equation of
state we develop an entirely new hadron resonance gas model and apply it to a
description of the hadron yield ratios measured at AGS, SPS, RHIC and ALICE
energies of nuclear collisions. The achieved quality of the fit per degree of
freedom is about 1.08. We confirm that the strangeness enhancement factor has a
peak at low AGS energies, while at and above the highest SPS energy of
collisions the chemical equilibrium of strangeness is observed. We argue that
the chemical equilibrium of strangeness, i.e. $\gamma_s \simeq 1$, observed
above the center of mass collision energy 4.3 GeV may be related to the
hadronization of quark gluon bags which have the Hagedorn mass spectrum, and,
hence, it may be a new signal for the onset of deconfinement.

design process starts in stark contrast to the easiness with which people can
use language to describe real and imaginary environments. We present SceneSeer:
an interactive text to 3D scene generation system that allows a user to design
3D scenes using natural language. A user provides input text from which we
extract explicit constraints on the objects that should appear in the scene.
Given these explicit constraints, the system then uses a spatial knowledge base
learned from an existing database of 3D scenes and 3D object models to infer an
arrangement of the objects forming a natural scene matching the input
description. Using textual commands the user can then iteratively refine the
created scene by adding, removing, replacing, and manipulating objects. We
evaluate the quality of 3D scenes generated by SceneSeer in a perceptual
evaluation experiment where we compare against manually designed scenes and
simpler baselines for 3D scene generation. We demonstrate how the generated
scenes can be iteratively refined through simple natural language commands.

effects, graphene-dielectric multilayers take advantage from the anomalous
features predicted for isolated suspended graphene sheets, even though they are
considerably affected by the presence of the dielectric substrate. They can
also archive the anomalous non-monotonic thermal metallic behavior by
increasing the graphene sheets density and their Fermi energy. In addition to a
strong thermal modulation occurring at short separations, in a region where the
force is orders of magnitude larger than the one occurring at large distances,
the force can be also adjusted by varying the number of graphene layers as well
as their Fermi energy levels, allowing for relevant force amplifications which
can be tuned, very rapidly and in-situ, by simply applying an electric
potential. Our predictions can be relevant for both Casimir experiments and
micro/nano electromechanical systems and in new devices for technological
applications.

Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the
near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)
survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby
galaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas
distributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using
baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the
power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the
SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray
AGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter
Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there
began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared
spectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,
with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are
scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy,
SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data

ML, Low* does not involve any garbage collection or implicit heap allocation;
instead, it has a structured memory model \`a la CompCert, and it provides the
control required for writing efficient low-level security-critical code.
  By virtue of typing, any Low* program is memory safe. In addition, the
programmer can make full use of the verification power of F* to write
high-level specifications and verify the functional correctness of Low* code
using a combination of SMT automation and sophisticated manual proofs. At
extraction time, specifications and proofs are erased, and the remaining code
enjoys a predictable translation to C. We prove that this translation preserves
semantics and side-channel resistance.
  We provide a new compiler back-end from Low* to C and, to evaluate our
approach, we implement and verify various cryptographic algorithms,
constructions, and tools for a total of about 28,000 lines of code,
specification and proof. We show that our Low* code delivers performance
competitive with existing (unverified) C cryptographic libraries, suggesting
our approach may be applicable to larger-scale low-level software.

characterize many useful notions of security, program refinement, and
equivalence for programs with diverse computational effects, and they have
received much attention in the recent literature. Rather than developing
separate tools for special classes of effects and relational properties, we
advocate using a general purpose proof assistant as a unifying framework for
the relational verification of effectful programs. The essence of our approach
is to model effectful computations using monads and to prove relational
properties on their monadic representations, making the most of existing
support for reasoning about pure programs.
  We apply this method in F* and evaluate it by encoding a variety of
relational program analyses, including information flow control, program
equivalence and refinement at higher order, correctness of program
optimizations and game-based cryptographic security. By relying on SMT-based
automation, unary weakest preconditions, user-defined effects, and monadic
reification, we show that, compared to unary properties, verifying relational
properties requires little additional effort from the F* programmer.

discrimination-free classifier first remove discrimination from the training

bounding the probability of the discrimination in prediction being within a

discrimination in population, in a dataset, and in prediction. We obtain two
important theoretical results: (1) the discrimination in prediction can still

we show the certainty equivalent is a classical solution. In particular, our
results cover when X is a one-dimensional affine diffusion and when returns,

the relationship between the factor process and both the indifference price and

to be a balanced coherent superposition of components with an arbitrary quantum

generalization of the multi-mode NOON state. The analytical form for the
quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) is presented, which shows the performance by
providing a lower bound of the estimation uncertainty. It is shown that the

are the NOON state, the entangled coherent state, the entangled squeezed
coherent state, and the entangled squeezed vacuum state. From the comparison
among these four states, we find that when the mean photon number is fixed, the
squeezed vacuum state has the smallest QCRB, followed by the squeezed coherent
state, entangled coherent state, and NOON state. We also illustrate that the
balanced entangled state can perform better than a more generalized unbalanced

this queueing scheme, we then design an airtime fairness scheduler that
operates at the access point and doesn't require any changes to clients.
  We evaluate our solution using both a theoretical model and experiments in a
testbed environment, formulating a suitable analytical model in the process. We
show that our solution achieves an order of magnitude reduction in latency
under load, large improvements in multi-station throughput, and nearly perfect
airtime fairness for both TCP and downstream UDP traffic. Further experiments
with application traffic confirm that the solution provides significant
performance gains for real-world traffic.We develop a production quality

  (ITCS) 2017",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several well-studied models of access to data samples, including statistical
queries, local differential privacy and low-communication algorithms rely on
queries that provide information about a function of a single sample. (For
example, a statistical query (SQ) gives an estimate of $Ex_{x \sim D}[q(x)]$
for any choice of the query function $q$ mapping $X$ to the reals, where $D$ is
an unknown data distribution over $X$.) Yet some data analysis algorithms rely
on properties of functions that depend on multiple samples. Such algorithms
would be naturally implemented using $k$-wise queries each of which is
specified by a function $q$ mapping $X^k$ to the reals. Hence it is natural to
ask whether algorithms using $k$-wise queries can solve learning problems more
efficiently and by how much.
  Blum, Kalai and Wasserman (2003) showed that for any weak PAC learning
problem over a fixed distribution, the complexity of learning with $k$-wise SQs
is smaller than the (unary) SQ complexity by a factor of at most $2^k$. We show
that for more general problems over distributions the picture is substantially
richer. For every $k$, the complexity of distribution-independent PAC learning
with $k$-wise queries can be exponentially larger than learning with
$(k+1)$-wise queries. We then give two approaches for simulating a $k$-wise
query using unary queries. The first approach exploits the structure of the
problem that needs to be solved. It generalizes and strengthens (exponentially)
the results of Blum et al.. It allows us to derive strong lower bounds for
learning DNF formulas and stochastic constraint satisfaction problems that hold
against algorithms using $k$-wise queries. The second approach exploits the
$k$-party communication complexity of the $k$-wise query function.

black holes in the centres of galaxies may moderate the growth of their hosts.
Gas outflows from supermassive black holes release huge quantities of energy
into the interstellar medium, clearing the surrounding gas. The most extreme of
these, the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), are the subset of X-ray detected
outflows with velocities higher than 10,000 km/s, believed to originate in
relativistic disc winds, a few hundred gravitational radii from the black hole.
The absorption features produced by these outflows are variable, but no clear
link has been found between the behaviour of the X-ray continuum and the energy
or equivalent width of the outflow features due to the long time-scales of
quasar variability. Here, we present the detection of multiple absorption lines
from an extreme ultra-fast gas flow in the X-ray spectrum of the active
galactic nucleus IRAS 13224-3809, at 0.236+/-0.006 times the speed of light
(71,000 km/s), where the absorption is strongly anti-correlated with the
emission from the inner regions of the accretion disk. If the gas flow is
identified as a genuine outflow then it is in the fastest 5 per cent of such
winds, and its variability is hundreds of times faster than in other variable
winds, allowing us to observe in hours what would take months in a quasar. We
find signatures of the wind simultaneously in both low and high energy
detectors, which are consistent with a single ionized outflow, linking the two
phenomena. The detection of the wind responding to the emission from the inner
disk demonstrates a connection between accretion processes occurring on very
different scales, with the X-rays from within a few gravitational radii of the
black hole ionizing the relativistically outflowing gas as the flux rises.

coupling and MPs has not been explicitly defined. In this work we establish
such a connection by studying the frequency-wavevector dispersion of a strongly
coupled magnon-cavity system, using a height-adjustable microwave cavity, and
by modelling the observed behaviour through the system's effective
permeability. A polariton gap between the upper and lower coupled modes of the
magnon-cavity system is defined, and is seen to be dependent on the system's
effective filling factor. This gap is equal to the MP polariton gap in the

electron elastic scattering total cross section (TCS) for the C60 fullerene in
the electron impact energy range 0.02 through 10.0 eV. The energy position of
the characteristic dramatically sharp resonance appearing at the second
Ramsauer Townsend (RT) minimum of the TCS representing stable C60 fullerene
negative ion formation agrees excellently with the measured electron affinity
(EA) of C60 [Huang et al 2014 J. Chem. Phys. 140 224315]. The benchmarked
potential and the Regge-pole method are then used to calculate electron elastic
scattering TCSs for selected fullerenes, from C54 through C240. The TCSs are
found to be characterized generally by RT minima, shape resonances (SRs) and
dramatically sharp resonances representing long lived ground state fullerene
negative ion formation. For the TCSs of C70, C76, C78, and C84 the agreement
between the energy positions of the very sharp resonances, corresponding to the
binding energies (BEs) of the resultant fullerene negative ions, and the
measured EAs is outstanding. Additionally, we extract the BEs of the resultant
fullerene negative ions from our calculated TCSs of the C86, C90 and C92
fullerenes with estimated EAs larger than 3.0 eV by the experiment [Boltalina

fullerenes, including C180 and C240. Most of the TCSs presented in this paper
are the first and only. Our novel approach is general and should be applicable
to other fullerenes as well and complex heavy atoms, such as the lanthanide
atoms. We conclude with a remark on the catalytic properties of the fullerenes

the way we search for accommodation, restaurants, etc. The underlying datasets
in such applications have numerous attributes that are mostly Boolean or
Categorical. Discovering the skyline of such datasets over a subset of

applications. There are only a few algorithms designed to compute the skyline
over categorical attributes, yet are applicable only when the number of
attributes is small.
  In this paper, we place the problem of skyline discovery over categorical
attributes into perspective and design efficient algorithms for two cases. (i)
In the absence of indices, we propose two algorithms, ST-S and ST-P, that
exploits the categorical characteristics of the datasets, organizing tuples in
a tree data structure, supporting efficient dominance tests over the candidate
set. (ii) We then consider the existence of widely used precomputed sorted
lists. After discussing several approaches, and studying their limitations, we
propose TA-SKY, a novel threshold style algorithm that utilizes sorted lists.
Moreover, we further optimize TA-SKY and explore its progressive nature, making
it suitable for applications with strict interactive requirements. In addition
to the extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms, we conduct a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the combination of real (including the
entire AirBnB data collection) and synthetic datasets to study the practicality
of the proposed algorithms. The results showcase the superior performance of
our techniques, outperforming applicable approaches by orders of magnitude.

to upwelling of hot materials as plumes. This study focuses upon the problem of
their ascent dynamics to provide an explanation of the periodic multiple
eruption events in large igneous provinces and hotspots. We demonstrate from
physical experiments that plumes can ascend in a continuous process to form a
single large head trailing into a long slender tail, typically described in the
literature only under specific physical conditions. Alternatively, they ascend
in a pulsating fashion, and produce multiple in-axis heads of varying
dimensions. Based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, we performed
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to constrain the
thermo-mechanical conditions that decide the continuous versus pulsating
dynamics. Our CFD simulations suggest the density ($\rho^*$) and the viscosity
($R$) ratios of the ambient to the plume materials and the influx rates ($Re$)
are the prime factors in controlling the ascent dynamics. Conditions with large
$R$ ($>$50) develop pulsating plumes, which are sustained preferentially under
low $\rho^*$ and $Re$ conditions. Again, the increasing temperature difference
between the plume and the ambient medium is found to promote pulsating
behaviour. From these CFD simulations we show the thermal structures of a
plume, and predict the peak thermal events near the surface that commence
periodically as pulses with a time interval of 1.4-3 Ma. The pulsating plume
model explains the multiple eruption events in the Deccan Traps in India, where
the time scale of their intervals estimated from the available
$^{40}Ar$/$^{39}Ar$ geochronological data shows an excellent match with our

agreement is best for halo masses $\sim10^{12.0}$ M$_\odot$, for which the

median ion mass-weighted radial gas velocities around the galaxies, and find
that most of the gas is infalling, with the infall velocity depending on halo

systems. Deficiencies and difficulties in dermoscopic images such as color
inconstancy, hair occlusion, dark corners and color charts make lesion
segmentation an intricate task. In order to detect the lesion in the presence
of these problems, we propose a supervised saliency detection method tailored
for dermoscopic images based on the discriminative regional feature integration
(DRFI). DRFI method incorporates multi-level segmentation, regional contrast,
property, background descriptors, and a random forest regressor to create
saliency scores for each region in the image. In our improved saliency
detection method, mDRFI, we have added some new features to regional property
descriptors. Also, in order to achieve more robust regional background
descriptors, a thresholding algorithm is proposed to obtain a new
pseudo-background region. Findings reveal that mDRFI is superior to DRFI in
detecting the lesion as the salient object in dermoscopic images. The proposed
overall lesion segmentation framework uses detected saliency map to construct
an initial mask of the lesion through thresholding and post-processing
operations. The initial mask is then evolving in a level set framework to fit
better on the lesion's boundaries. The results of evaluation tests on three
public datasets show that our proposed segmentation method outperforms the
other conventional state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms and its performance
is comparable with most recent approaches that are based on deep convolutional
neural networks.

For 2D interface problems, the idea is to introduce a small tube near the

mixed finite element method, except only at the interface. Thus the
computational cost is just slightly higher than the standard finite element
method. We present rigorous one dimensional analysis, which show second order
convergence order for both of the solution and the gradient in 1D. For two

convergence for the solution, and super-convergence for the gradient at the

target sequence into a sequence of basic units. These methods suffer from two
major drawbacks: 1) the set of basic units is fixed, such as the set of words,
characters or phonemes in speech recognition, and 2) the decomposition of
target sequences is fixed. These drawbacks usually result in sub-optimal
performance of modeling sequences. In this pa- per, we extend the popular CTC
loss criterion to alleviate these limitations, and propose a new loss function
called Gram-CTC. While preserving the advantages of CTC, Gram-CTC automatically
learns the best set of basic units (grams), as well as the most suitable
decomposition of tar- get sequences. Unlike CTC, Gram-CTC allows the model to
output variable number of characters at each time step, which enables the model
to capture longer term dependency and improves the computational efficiency. We
demonstrate that the proposed Gram-CTC improves CTC in terms of both
performance and efficiency on the large vocabulary speech recognition task at
multiple scales of data, and that with Gram-CTC we can outperform the
state-of-the-art on a standard speech benchmark.

the discrepancy in two measurements is amplified in the reconstructed

along a PN junction in graphene. We find that inter-channel scattering between
same-spin edge channels along the physical graphene edge can be used to form
beamsplitters, while the absence of inter-channel scattering along gate-defined
interfaces can be used to form isolated interferometer arms. Surprisingly, our
interferometer is robust to dephasing effects at energies an order of magnitude

processes. We present a method of simulating noisy Clifford circuits that is
both accurate and practical in experimentally relevant regimes. In particular,
the cost is weakly exponential in the size and the degree of non-Cliffordness
of the circuit. Our approach is based on the construction of exact
representations of quantum channels as quasiprobability distributions over
stabilizer operations, which are then sampled, simulated, and weighted to yield
unbiased statistical estimates of circuit outputs and other observables. As a
demonstration of these techniques we simulate a Steane [[7,1,3]]-encoded
logical operation with non-Clifford errors and compute its fault tolerance
error threshold. We expect that the method presented here will enable studies
of much larger and more realistic quantum circuits than was previously
possible.

Perhaps counter-intuitively, the analyses show that compliant solid

triangular lattice separately, we determine the role of each type of disorder
in the vibration of the resulting mass-spring networks. We are concerned mainly
with the origin of the boson peak and the connection between the boson peak and
the transverse Ioffe-Regel limit. For all types of disorders, we observe the
emergence of the boson peak and Ioffe-Regel limits. With increasing disorder,
the boson peak frequency $\omega_{BP}$, transverse Ioffe-Regel frequency
$\omega_{IR}^T$, and longitudinal Ioffe-Regel frequency $\omega_{IR}^L$ all
decrease. We find that there are two ways for the boson peak to form:
developing from and coexisting with (but remaining independent of) the
transverse van Hove singularity without and with local coordination number
fluctuation. In the presence of a single type of disorder, $\omega_{IR}^T\ge
\omega_{BP}$, and $\omega_{IR}^T\approx \omega_{BP}$ only when the disorder is
sufficiently strong and causes spatial fluctuation of the local coordination
number. Moreover, if there is no positional disorder, $\omega_{IR}^T\approx
\omega_{IR}^L$. Therefore, the argument that the boson peak is equivalent to
the transverse Ioffe-Regel limit is not general. Our results suggest that both
local coordination number and positional disorder are necessary for the
argument to hold, which is actually the case for most disordered solids such as
marginally jammed solids and structural glasses. We further combine two types
of disorders to cause disorder in both the local coordination number and
lattice site position. The density of vibrational states of the resulting
networks resembles that of marginally jammed solids well. However, the relation
between the boson peak and the transverse Ioffe-Regel limit is still indefinite

methods for optimizing sparsity-constrained minimization models, with the best

IHT-style methods are designed for sparse minimization in primal form. It
remains open to explore duality theory and algorithms in such a non-convex and
NP-hard problem setting. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing a
duality theory for sparsity-constrained minimization with $\ell_2$-regularized
loss function and proposing an IHT-style algorithm for dual maximization. Our
sparse duality theory provides a set of sufficient and necessary conditions
under which the original NP-hard/non-convex problem can be equivalently solved
in a dual formulation. The proposed dual IHT algorithm is a super-gradient
method for maximizing the non-smooth dual objective. An interesting finding is
that the sparse recovery performance of dual IHT is invariant to the Restricted
Isometry Property (RIP), which is required by virtually all the existing primal
IHT algorithms without sparsity relaxation. Moreover, a stochastic variant of
dual IHT is proposed for large-scale stochastic optimization. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of dual IHT algorithms to the state-of-the-art
primal IHT-style algorithms in model estimation accuracy and computational

images. However, a systematic review of the literature concerning datasets and
methods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all
existing datasets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of
scene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and
diversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the
development of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This
paper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we

viewpoint, object pose, illumination, background, and occlusion, and (iii) has
high within-class diversity and between-class similarity. The creation of this
dataset will enable the community to develop and evaluate various data-driven
algorithms. Finally, several representative methods are evaluated using the
proposed dataset and the results are reported as a useful baseline for future

Thus, it could make the feature representations of the RGB and depth modalities

for adaptation from random and passive diversification of the phenotype to more
proactive decision making, in which environmental information is sensed and
exploited more actively and effectively. Understanding the fundamental relation
between fitness and information is therefore crucial to clarify the limits and
universal properties of adaptation. In this work, we elucidate the underlying
stochastic and information-thermodynamic structure in this process, by deriving
causal fluctuation relations (FRs) of fitness and information. Combined with a
duality between phenotypic and environmental dynamics, the FRs reveal the limit
of fitness gain, the relation of time reversibility with the achievability of
the limit, and the possibility and condition for gaining excess fitness due to
environmental fluctuation. The loss of fitness due to causal constraints and
the limited capacity of real organisms is shown to be the difference between
time-forward and time-backward path probabilities of phenotypic and
environmental dynamics. Furthermore, the FRs generalize the concept of
evolutionary stable state (ESS) for fluctuating environment by giving the
probability that the optimal strategy on average can be invaded by a suboptimal
one owing to rare environmental fluctuation. These results clarify the

tensor products of Hilbert spaces of Sobolev-analytic type. The Sobolev part is
defined on a finite dimensional domain, whereas the analytical space is defined
on an infinite dimensional domain. As main mathematical tool, we use the
$\varepsilon$-dimension of a subset in a Hilbert space. The
$\varepsilon$-dimension gives the lowest number of linear information that is
needed to approximate an element from the set in the norm of the Hilbert space
up to an accuracy $\varepsilon>0$. From a practical point of view this means
that we a priori fix an accuracy and ask for the amount of information to
achieve this accuracy. Such an analysis usually requires sharp estimates on the
cardinality of certain index sets which are in our case infinite-dimensional
hyperbolic crosses. As main result, we obtain sharp bounds of the
$\varepsilon$-dimension of the Sobolev-analytic-type function classes which
depend only on the smoothness differences in the Sobolev spaces and the
dimension of the finite dimensional domain where these spaces are defined. This
implies in particular that, up to constants, the costs of the infinite

finite-variate Sobolev approximation problem. We demonstrate this procedure

expensive. Hence, some researchers explore ""unsupervised"" approaches to quality
prediction that does not require labelled data. An alternate technique is to
use ""supervised"" approaches that learn models from project data labelled with,
say, ""defective"" or ""not-defective"". Most researchers use these supervised
models since, it is argued, they can exploit more knowledge of the projects.
  At FSE'16, Yang et al. reported startling results where unsupervised defect
predictors outperformed supervised predictors for effort-aware just-in-time
defect prediction. If confirmed, these results would lead to a dramatic
simplification of a seemingly complex task (data mining) that is widely
explored in the software engineering literature.
  This paper repeats and refutes those results as follows. (1) There is much
variability in the efficacy of the Yang et al. predictors so even with their
approach, some supervised data is required to prune weaker predictors away.
(2)Their findings were grouped across $N$ projects. When we repeat their
analysis on a project-by-project basis, supervised predictors are seen to work
better.
  Even though this paper rejects the specific conclusions of Yang et al., we
still endorse their general goal. In our our experiments, supervised predictors
did not perform outstandingly better than unsupervised ones for effort-aware
just-in-time defect prediction. Hence, they may indeed be some combination of
unsupervised learners to achieve comparable performance to supervised ones. We
therefore encourage others to work in this promising area.

need to be assessed with respect to its computational cost. This is
particularly important for deep learning since these learners need hours (to
weeks) to train the model. Such long training time limits the ability of (a)~a
researcher to test the stability of their conclusion via repeated runs with
different random seeds; and (b)~other researchers to repeat, improve, or even
refute that original work.
  For example, recently, deep learning was used to find which questions in the
Stack Overflow programmer discussion forum can be linked together. That deep
learning system took 14 hours to execute. We show here that applying a very
simple optimizer called DE to fine tune SVM, it can achieve similar (and
sometimes better) results. The DE approach terminated in 10 minutes; i.e. 84

Polynomial Chaos Expansion is a common goal in modern parametric uncertainty

toward theoretical and computational strategies for addressing the sparse
corruptions problem, where a small number of measurements are highly corrupted.
Such a situation has become pertinent today since modern computational
frameworks are sufficiently complex with many interdependent components that
may introduce hardware and software failures, some of which can be difficult to
detect and result in a highly polluted simulation result.
  In this paper we present a novel compressive sampling-based theoretical
analysis for a regularized $\ell^1$ minimization algorithm that aims to recover
sparse expansion coefficients in the presence of measurement corruptions. Our
recovery results are uniform, and prescribe algorithmic regularization
parameters in terms of a user-defined a priori estimate on the ratio of
measurements that are believed to be corrupted. We also propose an iteratively
reweighted optimization algorithm that automatically refines the value of the
regularization parameter, and empirically produces superior results. Our
numerical results test our framework on several medium-to-high dimensional

substantially reduces the computational cost. Two numerical examples are

solution and the linear interpolation of the exact solution is superconvergent
under the $H^1$-seminorm, although the pollution error still exists. Second, we

can only improve the interpolation error and has no effect on the pollution
error. Furthermore, we estimate the error between the finite element gradient

between these two quantities. Finally, we apply the Richardson extrapolation to

d - have been observed by the Kepler satellite, and three point sources (A, B,
and C) are seen in high angular resolution images.
  From spectroscopic observations made with the HIDES spectrograph attached to
the 1.88-m telescope of the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), for the
first time we calculated radial velocities (RVs) of the component B - a pair of
G-type stars - and combined them with Kepler photometry in order to obtain
absolute physical parameters of this pair. We also managed to directly measure
RVs of the pulsator, also for the first time. Additionally, we modelled the
light curves of the 1.52 and 1.43-day pairs, and measured their eclipse timing
variations (ETVs). We also performed relative astrometry and photometry of
three sources seen on the images taken with the NIRC2 camera of the Keck II
telescope. Finally, we compared our results with theoretical isochrones.
  The brightest component Aa is the hybrid pulsator, transited every 94.2 days
by a pair of K/M-type stars (Ab1+Ab2), which themselves form a 1.52-day
eclipsing binary. The components Ba and Bb are late G-type stars, forming
another eclipsing pair with a 8.65 day period. Their masses and radii are
$M_{Ba}=0.894\pm0.010$ M$_\odot$, $R_{Ba}=0.802\pm0.044$ R$_\odot$ for the
primary, and $M_{Bb}=0.888\pm0.010$ M$_\odot$, $R_{Bb}=0.856\pm0.038$ R$_\odot$
for the secondary. The remaining period of 1.43 days is possibly related to a
faint third star C, which itself is most likely a background object. The
system's properties are well-represented by a 35 Myr isochrone. There are also
hints of additional bodies in the system.

shock acceleration (DSA) models:(1) weak-shock models with $M_{\rm s}\lesssim
2$ and a preexisting population of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) with a flat
energy spectrum,and (2) strong-shock models with $M_{\rm s}\approx3$ and either
shock-generated suprathermal electrons or preexisting fossil CRe. We calculate
the synchrotron emission from the accelerated CRe, following the time evolution
of the electron DSA, and subsequent radiative cooling and postshock turbulent
acceleration (TA). We find that both models could reproduce reasonably well the
observed integrated radio spectrum of the Toothbrush relic, but the observed
broad transverse profile requires the stochastic acceleration by downstream
turbulence, which we label ""turbulent acceleration"" or TA to distinguish it
from DSA. Moreover, to account for the almost uniform radio spectral index
profile along the length of the relic, the weak-shock models require a preshock
region over 400~kpc with a uniform population of preexisting CRe with a high
cutoff energy ($\gtrsim 40$ GeV). Due to the short cooling time, it is
challenging to explain the origin of such energetic electrons. Therefore, we
suggest the strong-shock models with low-energy seed CRe ($\lesssim 150$~MeV)
are preferred for the radio observations of this relic.

$\{1,2\}$ and first term $1$ which equals the sequence of run-lengths of
itself, we call this $K(1,2).$ We define $K(m,n)$ similarly. A well-known
conjecture is that the limiting density of $K(1,2)$ is one-half. We state a
natural generalization, the ""generalized uniformness conjecture"" (GUC). The GUC
seems intractable, but we prove a partial result. The GUC implies that members
of a certain family of directed graphs $G_{m,n,k}$ are all strongly connected.
We prove this unconditionally.
  For $d>0,$ let $cf(m,n,d)$ be the density of indices $i$ such that $K(m,
n)_i=K(m, n)_{i+d}.$ Essentially, $cf(m, n, d)$ is the autocorrelation function
of a stationary stochastic process with random variables
$\{X_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ whereby a sample of a finite window of this process
is formed by copying as many consecutive terms of $K(m,n)$ starting from a
""uniformly random index"" $i\in\mathbb{Z}_+.$ Assuming the GUC, we prove that we
can compute $cf(m,n,d)$ exactly for quite large $d$ by constructing a periodic
sequence $S$ of period around $10^{8.5}$ such that for $d$ not too large, the
correlation frequency at distance $d$ in $K(m,n)$ equals that in $S.$ We
efficiently compute correlations in $S$ using polynomial multiplication via
FFT.
  We plot our estimates $cf(m,n,d)$ for several small values of $(m,n)$ and
$d\le10^5$ or $10^6$. We note many suggested patterns. For example, for the
three pairs $(m,n)\in\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)\},$ the function $cf(m,n,d)$ behaves
very differently as we restrict $d$ to the $m+n$ residue classes $\text{mod}$
$m+n.$ The plots of the three functions $cf(1,2,d),cf(2,3,d),$ and $cf(3,4,d)$
resemble waves which have common nodes. We consider this very unusual behavior
for an autocorrelation function. The pairs $(m,n)\in\{(1,4),(1,6),(2,5)\}$ show
wave-like patterns with much more noise.

mobility comparable to inorganic electronics. Here we propose a strategy to
utilize the overlap of pz orbitals to increase the TE efficiency of layered

classical molecular dynamics simulations, we find that A-A stacked PCN has
unexpectedly high cross-plane ZT up to 0.52 at 300 K, which can contribute to
n-type TE groups. The high ZT originates from its one-dimensional charge
transport and small thermal conductivity. The thermal contribution of the
overlap of pz orbitals is investigated, which noticeably enhances the thermal
transport when compared with the thermal conductivity without considering the
overlap effect. For a better understanding of its TE advantages, we find that
the low-dimensional charge transport results from strong pz-overlap
interactions and the in-plane electronic confinement, by comparing
{\pi}-stacking carbon nitride derivatives and graphite. This study can provide
a guidance to search for high cross-plane TE performance in layered materials.

Among them, OpenACC offers a high-level approach based on compiler directive

compilers the support of each different accelerator, but one has to carefully
assess the relative costs of portable approaches versus computing efficiency.

relevant to communication problems, namely, models of a parameter-dependent
signal (modulated signal) corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise, but the
methodology proposed is also applicable to other types of parametric families,
such as models of linear systems driven by random input signals (white noise,
in most cases), and others. In addition to the well known motivations of the
risk-sensitive cost function (i.e., the exponential quadratic cost function),
which is most notably, the robustness to model uncertainty, we also view this
cost function as a tool for studying fundamental limits concerning the tail
behavior of the estimation error. Another interesting aspect, that we
demonstrate in a certain parametric model, is that the risk-sensitive cost
function may be subjected to phase transitions, owing to some analogies with

consequence of the noninertial character of the background where the field
mediating the Casimir interaction propagates. While in the former case the
characteristic crossover length scale is proportional to the inverse of the
surface gravity of the black hole, in the latter it is determined by the
inverse of the proper acceleration of the atoms.

approaches to find a collision free path can be categorically divided into
trajectory optimisers and sampling-based methods. When planning using occupancy
maps, the sampling-based approach is the prevalent method. The main drawback of
such techniques is that the reasoning about the expected cost of a plan is
limited to the search heuristic used by each method. We introduce a novel
planning method based on trajectory optimisation to plan safe and efficient
paths in continuous occupancy maps. We extend the expressiveness of the
state-of-the-art functional gradient optimisation methods by devising a
stochastic gradient update rule to optimise a path represented as a Gaussian
process. This approach avoids the need to commit to a specific resolution of
the path representation, whether spatial or parametric. We utilise a continuous
occupancy map representation in order to define our optimisation objective,
which enables fast computation of occupancy gradients. We show that this
approach is essential in order to ensure convergence to the optimal path, and
present results and comparisons to other planning methods in both simulation
and with real laser data. The experiments demonstrate the benefits of using
this technique when planning for safe and efficient paths in continuous
occupancy maps.

its overall frequency of use in the language rises with time with an S-shaped
growth curve. Yet, this claim has only been supported by a limited number of
case studies. In this paper, we provide the first corpus-based quantitative
confirmation of the genericity of the S-curve in language change. Moreover, we
uncover another generic pattern, a latency phase of variable duration preceding
the S-growth, during which the frequency of use of the semantically expanding
word remains low and more or less constant. We also propose a usage-based model
of language change supported by cognitive considerations, which predicts that
both phases, the latency and the fast S-growth, take place. The driving
mechanism is a stochastic dynamics, a random walk in the space of frequency of
use. The underlying deterministic dynamics highlights the role of a control
parameter, the strength of the cognitive impetus governing the onset of change,
which tunes the system at the vicinity of a saddle-node bifurcation. In the
neighborhood of the critical point, the latency phase corresponds to the
diffusion time over the critical region, and the S-growth to the fast
convergence that follows. The duration of the two phases is computed as
specific first passage times of the random walk process, leading to
distributions that fit well the ones extracted from our dataset. We argue that
our results are not specific to the studied corpus, but apply to semantic
change in general.

$x$ at time $0$ and is known to have frequency $z$ at time $T$ can be modelled
by the bridge process of the Wright-Fisher diffusion. Bridges when $x=z=0$ are
particularly interesting because they model the trajectory of the frequency of
an allele which appears at a time, then is lost by random drift or mutation
after a time $T$. The coalescent genealogy back in time of a population in a
neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion process is well understood. In this paper we
obtain a new interpretation of the coalescent genealogy of the population in a
bridge from a time $t\in (0,T)$. In a bridge with allele frequencies of 0 at
times 0 and $T$ the coalescence structure is that the population coalesces in
two directions from $t$ to $0$ and $t$ to $T$ such that there is just one
lineage of the allele under consideration at times $0$ and $T$. The genealogy
in Wright-Fisher diffusion bridges with selection is more complex than in the
neutral model, but still with the property of the population branching and
coalescing in two directions from time $t\in (0,T)$. The density of the
frequency of an allele at time $t$ is expressed in a way that shows coalescence
in the two directions. A new algorithm for exact simulation of a neutral
Wright-Fisher bridge is derived. This follows from knowing the density of the
frequency in a bridge and exact simulation from the Wright-Fisher diffusion.
The genealogy of the neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is also modelled by branching
P\'olya urns, extending a representation in a Wright-Fisher diffusion. This is
a new very interesting representation that relates Wright-Fisher bridges to
classical urn models in a Bayesian setting.

simulations of the flow. Yet observations of strongly accreting sources
generally fail to exhibit cyclic or unstable dynamics on the expected
timescales. This paper checks whether turbulent fluctuations impede thermal
instability. It also asks if it makes sense to conduct linear stability
analyses on a turbulent background. These issues are explored with a set of MRI
simulations in thermally unstable local boxes in combination with stochastic
equations that approximate the disk energetics. These models show that the
disk's thermal behaviour deviates significantly from laminar theory, though
ultimately a thermal runaway does occur. We find that the disk temperature
evolves as a biased random walk, rather than increasing exponentially, and thus
generates a broad spread of outcomes, with instability often delayed for
several thermal times. We construct a statistical theory that describes some of
this behaviour, emphasising the importance of the `escape time' and its
associated probability distribution. In conclusion, turbulent fluctuations on

the vision we outlined in [Harel,Lekien,P\'eba\""y-2017] for the visualization
and analysis of tree-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations, using
the hypertree grid paradigm which we proposed.
  The first filter presented hereafter implements an adaptive approach in order
to accelerate the rendering of 2-dimensional AMR grids, hereby solving the
problem posed by the loss of interactivity that occurs when dealing with large
and/or deeply refined meshes. Specifically, view parameters are taken into
account, in order to: on one hand, avoid creating surface elements that are
outside of the view area; on the other hand, utilize level-of-detail properties
to cull those cells that are deemed too small to be visible with respect to the
given view parameters. This adaptive approach often results in a massive
increase in rendering performance.
  In addition, two new selection filters provide data analysis capabilities, by
means of allowing for the extraction of those cells within a hypertree grid
that are deemed relevant in some sense, either geometrically or topologically.

inferred from factorization of exact partition functions. Under Seiberg-like
dualities, the 3d partition function must remain invariant, yet it is not a
priori clear what should happen to the vortex dynamics. We observe that the 1d
quivers for the vortices remain the same, and the net effect of the 3d duality
map manifests as 1d Wall-Crossing phenomenon; Although the vortex number can
shift along such duality maps, the ranks of the 1d quiver theory are
unaffected, leading to a notion of fundamental vortices as basic building
blocks for topological sectors. For Aharony-type duality, in particular, where
one must supply extra chiral fields to couple with monopole operators on the
dual side, 1d wall-crossings of an infinite number of vortex quiver theories
are neatly and collectively encoded by 3d determinant of such extra chiral
fields. As such, 1d wall-crossing of the vortex theory encodes the
particle-vortex duality embedded in the 3d Seiberg-like duality. For $\mathcal
N = 4$, the D-brane picture is used to motivate this 3d/1d connection, while,
for $\mathcal N = 2$, this 3d/1d connection is used to fine-tune otherwise
ambiguous vortex dynamics. We also prove some identities of 3d supersymmetric
partition functions for the Aharony duality using this vortex wall-crossing
interpretation.

effective data offloading in the integrated cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
However, previously proposed network selection schemes mainly focused on
offloading as much data traffic to Wi-Fi as possible, without systematically
considering the Wi-Fi network congestion and the ping-pong effect, both of
which may lead to a poor overall user quality of experience. Thus, in this
paper, we study a more practical network selection problem by considering both
the impacts of the network congestion and switching penalties. More
specifically, we formulate the users' interactions as a Bayesian network
selection game (NSG) under the incomplete information of the users' mobilities.
We prove that it is a Bayesian potential game and show the existence of a pure
Bayesian Nash equilibrium that can be easily reached. We then propose a
distributed network selection (DNS) algorithm based on the network congestion
statistics obtained from the operator. Furthermore, we show that computing the
optimal centralized network allocation is an NP-hard problem, which further
justifies our distributed approach. Simulation results show that the DNS
algorithm achieves the highest user utility and a good fairness among users, as
compared with the on-the-spot offloading and cellular-only benchmark schemes.

compared to that in the bulk. The same time, NMR T2 relaxation of protons of
NH3 group of the EA cation is faster by a factor of 22 than that in bulk. 2H
NMR spectra of selectively labeled CH2 and CH3 groups of EA do not demonstrate
any ordering of the EA between the glass plates. We suggested that these data
favor a model where a bulk isotropic sponge like structure of EAN is saved in
the confinement, but sizes of connecting channels increases. Those leads to
faster translational diffusion and faster exchange processes of protons of NH3

$G$ so that, for every pair of vertices, all edges of at least one shortest
path between them receive different colors. The minimum number of colors
necessary in such a coloring is the strong rainbow connection number
($\src(G)$) of the graph. When proving upper bounds on $\src(G)$, it is natural
to prove that a coloring exists where, for \emph{every} shortest path between
every pair of vertices in the graph, all edges of the path receive different
colors. Therefore, we introduce and formally define this more restricted edge
coloring number, which we call \emph{very strong rainbow connection number}
($\vsrc(G)$).
  In this paper, we give upper bounds on $\vsrc(G)$ for several graph classes,
some of which are tight. These immediately imply new upper bounds on $\src(G)$
for these classes, showing that the study of $\vsrc(G)$ enables meaningful
progress on bounding $\src(G)$. Then we study the complexity of the problem to
compute $\vsrc(G)$, particularly for graphs of bounded treewidth, and show this
is an interesting problem in its own right. We prove that $\vsrc(G)$ can be
computed in polynomial time on cactus graphs; in contrast, this question is
still open for $\src(G)$. We also observe that deciding whether $\vsrc(G) = k$
is fixed-parameter tractable in $k$ and the treewidth of $G$. Finally, on
general graphs, we prove that there is no polynomial-time algorithm to decide
whether $\vsrc(G) \leq 3$ nor to approximate $\vsrc(G)$ within a factor

completeness problem of Floyd-Hoare logic. The known versions of nonstandard
semantics, the Hungary semantics and axiomatic semantics, are so general that
they are absent either from mathematical elegance or from practical usefulness.
The aim of this paper is to exhibit a not only mathematically elegant but also
practically useful nonstandard semantics. A basic property of computable
functions in the standard model $N$ of Peano arithmetic $PA$ is
$\Sigma_1$-definability. However, the functions induced by the standard
interpretation of while-programs $S$ in nonstandard models $M$ of $PA$ are not
always arithmetical. The problem consists in that the standard termination of
$S$ in $M$ uses the finiteness in $N$, which is not the finiteness in $M$. To
this end, we shall give a new interpretation of $S$ in $M$ such that the
termination of $S$ uses $M$-finiteness, and the functions produced by $S$ in
all models of $PA$ have the uniform $\Sigma_1$-definability. Then we define,
based on the new semantics of while-programs, a new semantics of Hoare logic in
nonstandard models of $PA$, and show that the standard axiom system of Hoare
logic is sound and complete w.r.t. the new semantics. It will be established,
in $PA$, that the Hungary semantics and axiomatic semantics coincide with the
new semantics of while-programs. Moreover, various comparisons with the
previous results, usefulness of the nonstandard semantics, and remarks on the

temperature differences to electric power and vice versa. Despite remarkable
advances have been achieved in the past decades for various TE systems, the
energy conversion efficiencies of TE devices, which is characterized by a
dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT ), remain a generally poor factor that
severely limits their competitiveness and range of employment. The bottleneck
for substantially boosting ZT coefficient lies in the strong interdependence of
the physical parameters involved in electronic and phononic transport. Here, we
propose a new strategy of incorporating nanotwinned structures to decouple the
electronic and phononic transport. Combining the new concept of nanotwin with
the previously widely used nanocrystalline approach, the power factor of the Si
nanotwin-nanocrystalline heterostructures is enhanced by 120% compared to bulk
crystalline Si, while the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced to a level
well below the amorphous limit, yielding a theoretical limit of 0.43 for ZT
coefficient at room temperature. This value is almost two orders of magnitude
larger than that for bulk Si and twice of the polycrystalline Si. Even for the
experimentally existing nanotwin-nanocrystalline heterostructures (e.g. grain
size of 5 nm), the ZT coefficient can be as high as 0.2 at room temperature,
which is the highest ZT value among all the Si based bulk nanostructures so
far. Such substantial improvement stems from two aspects: (1) the improvement
of the power factor is caused by the increase of Seebeck coefficient
(degeneracy of the band valley) and the enhancement of electrical conductivity
(the reduction of the effective band mass); (2) the significant reduction of
the lattice thermal conductivity is mainly caused by the extremely strong
phonon-grain boundary and phonon-twin boundary scattering.

eye is capable to obtain high resolution images due to visual hyperacuity and
presents an impressive sensitivity and dynamic range when set against
conventional digital cameras of similar characteristics. This article is based
on the hypothesis that the human eye may be benefiting from diffraction to

the introduction of a controlled diffraction pattern at an initial stage,
enables the use of a reduced number of sensors for capturing the image and

analysis is equivalent to approximately a 35% increase in sample size. A
modified version of the method is proposed to reduce the computational effort
required. We show this modified method maintains much of the efficiency
advantages.

integrals of polylogarithms by using the methods of generating function and
integral representations of series. Then we apply it to obtain the closed forms
of all quadratic Euler sums of weight equal to ten. Furthermore, we also
establish some relations between multiple zeta (star) values and nonlinear
Euler sums. As applications of these relations, we give new closed form
representations of several cubic Euler sums through single zeta values and
linear sums. Finally, with the help of numerical computations of Mathematica or
Maple, we evaluate several other Euler sums of weight ten.

single calculation on a monolayer of the material. We test this scheme on
multilayers of MoS$_2$, graphene and phosphorene. This new scheme yields
results in excellent agreement with the standard methods at a fraction of the

some conditions, funding is either a cost or a benefit, i.e., one of the
lending/borrowing rates does not play a role in pricing derivatives. When
derivatives are priced, considering different lending/borrowing rates leads to
semi-linear BSDEs and PDEs, and thus it is necessary to solve the equations
numerically. However, once it can be guaranteed that only one of the rates
affects pricing, linear equations can be recovered and analytical formulae can
be derived. Moreover, as a byproduct, our results explain how debt value
adjustment (DVA) and funding benefits are dissimilar. It is often believed that
considering both DVA and funding benefits results in a double-counting issue
but it will be shown that the two components are affected by different
mathematical structures of derivative transactions. We find that funding
benefit is related to the decreasing property of the payoff function, but this
relationship decreases as the funding choices of underlying assets are
transferred to repo markets.

stochastic variational inequalities requiring only pseudo-monotonicity. We
provide convergence and complexity analysis, allowing for an unbounded feasible
set, unbounded operator, non-uniform variance of the oracle and, also, we do
not require any regularization. Alongside the stochastic approximation
procedure, we iteratively reduce the variance of the stochastic error. Our
method attains the optimal oracle complexity $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ (up to
a logarithmic term) and a faster rate $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ in terms of the mean
(quadratic) natural residual and the D-gap function, where $K$ is the number of
iterations required for a given tolerance $\epsilon>0$. Such convergence rate
represents an acceleration with respect to the stochastic error. The generated
sequence also enjoys a new feature: the sequence is bounded in $L^p$ if the
stochastic error has finite $p$-moment. Explicit estimates for the convergence
rate, the oracle complexity and the $p$-moments are given depending on problem
parameters and distance of the initial iterate to the solution set. Moreover,
sharper constants are possible if the variance is uniform over the solution set
or the feasible set. Our results provide new classes of stochastic variational
inequalities for which a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ holds in terms
of the mean-squared distance to the solution set. Our analysis includes the
distributed solution of pseudo-monotone Cartesian variational inequalities
under partial coordination of parameters between users of a network.

applicability and improves, up to constants, the desired efficient acceleration
of previous variance reduction methods, all of which still assume knowledge of
$L$ (and, hence, are not robust against its estimate). Precisely, compared to
the iteration and oracle complexities of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ of
previous robust methods with a small stepsize policy, our robust method obtains
the faster iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ with oracle
complexity of $(\ln L)\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-2})$ (up to logs). This matches,
up to constants, the sample complexity of the sample average approximation
estimator which does not assume additional problem information (such as $L$).
Differently from previous robust methods for ill-conditioned problems, we allow
an unbounded feasible set and an oracle with multiplicative noise (MN) whose
variance is not necessarily uniformly bounded. These properties are seen in our
complexity estimates which depend only on $L$ and local second or forth moments
at solutions. The robustness and variance reduction properties of our DS-SA
line search scheme come at the expense of nonmartingale-like dependencies (NMD)
due to the needed inner statistical estimation of a lower bound for $L$. In
order to handle a NMD and a MN, our proofs rely on a novel localization
argument based on empirical process theory. We also propose another robust
method for SVIs over the wider class of H\""older continuous operators.

relies primarily on the difficulty of decoding random linear codes. The best
decoding algorithms are all improvements of an old algorithm due to Prange:
they are known under the name of information set decoding techniques. It is
also important to assess the security of such cryptosystems against a quantum

quantising of the simplest information set decoding algorithm, namely Prange's

quadratic speed-up of Prange's algorithm. In this paper, we quantise other
information set decoding algorithms by using quantum walk techniques which were
devised for the subset-sum problem by Bernstein, Jeffery, Lange and Meurer.
This results in improving the worst-case complexity of $2^{0.06035n}$ of
Bernstein's algorithm to $2^{0.05869n}$ with the best algorithm presented here

hardens over time through two different aging processes. The first process
dominates the initial period of hydration and is characterized by the shear
stress $\sigma$ varying sub-linearly with the strain-rate $\dot{\gamma}$;
during this process the system is in a relatively low-density state and the
inter-particle interactions are dominated by hydrodynamic lubrication. At a
later stage of hydration the system evolves to a high-density state where the
interactions become frictional, and $\sigma$ varies super-linearly with
$\dot{\gamma}$; this is identified as the second process. An instability,
indicated by a drop in $\sigma$, that is non-monotonic with $\dot{\gamma}$ and
can be tuned by temperature, separates the two processes. Both from rheology

fracture mechanics of space-filling structure.

knowledge lies much more in competence performativity and innovation than in
simply knowing. Reaching such competency in areas such as astronomy and physics
has long been known to be challenging. The movement from everyday conceptions
of the world around us to a disciplinary interpretation is fraught with
pitfalls and problems. Thus, what underpins the characteristics of the
disciplinary trajectory to competence becomes an important educational
consideration. In this article we report on a study involving what students and
lecturers discern from the same disciplinary semiotic resource. We use this to
propose an Anatomy of Disciplinary Discernment (ADD), a hierarchy of what is
focused on and how it is interpreted in an appropriate, disciplinary manner, as
an overarching fundamental aspect of disciplinary learning. Students and
lecturers in astronomy and physics were asked to describe what they could
discern from a video simulation of travel through our Galaxy and beyond. 137
people from nine countries participated. The descriptions were analysed using a
hermeneutic interpretive study approach. The analysis resulted in the
formulation of five qualitatively different categories of discernment; the ADD,
reflecting a view of participants' competence levels. The ADD reveals four
increasing levels of disciplinary discernment: Identification, Explanation,
Appreciation, and Evaluation. This facilitates the identification of a clear
relationship between educational level and the level of disciplinary
discernment. The analytical outcomes of the study suggest how teachers of
science, after using the ADD to assess the students disciplinary knowledge, may
attain new insights into how to create more effective learning environments by
explicitly crafting their teaching to support the crossing of boundaries in the
ADD model.

Attributing their origin to specific types of stars, however, often proves
difficult. Intermediate-mass stars of 4-8 solar masses are expected to
contribute a large fraction of meteoritic stardust. However, no grains have
been found with characteristic isotopic compositions expected from such stars.
This is a long-standing puzzle, which points to serious gaps in our
understanding of the lifecycle of stars and dust in our Galaxy. Here we show
that the increased proton-capture rate of $^{17}$O reported by a recent
underground experiment leads to $^{17}$O/$^{16}$O isotopic ratios that match
those observed in a population of stardust grains, for proton-burning
temperatures of 60-80 million K. These temperatures are indeed achieved at the
base of the convective envelope during the late evolution of intermediate-mass
stars of 4-8 solar masses, which reveals them as the most likely site of origin
of the grains. This result provides the first direct evidence that these stars

fundamental aspect of their analysis. In spatially extended systems,
particularly in pattern-forming systems, there are many possible responses,
including critical transitions, gradual transitions and locally confined
responses. Here, we use the context of vegetation dynamics in drylands in order
to study the response of pattern-forming ecosystems to oscillating
precipitation and local disturbances. We focus on two precipitation ranges, a
bistability range of bare soil with a patterned vegetation state, and a
bistability range of uniform vegetation with a patterned vegetation state. In
these ranges, there are many different stable states, which allow for both
abrupt and gradual transitions between the system states to occur. We find that
large amplitude oscillations of the precipitation rate can lead to a collapse
of the vegetation in one range, while in the other range, they result in the
convergence to a patterned state with a preferred wavelength. In addition, we
show that a series of local disturbances results in the collapse of the
vegetation in one range, while it drives the system toward fluctuations around
a finite average biomass in the other range. Moreover, it is shown that under
certain conditions, local disturbances can actually increase the overall
vegetation density. These significant differences in the system response are
attributed to the existence of localized states in one of the bistability
ranges.

probably the main mass of the Phaethon-Geminid stream complex (PGC), can be the
most metamorphic C-complex asteroid in our solar system, since it is heated up
to ~1000 K by the solar radiation around its perihelion passages. Hence, its
surface material may be easily decomposed in near-sun environment. Phaethon's
spectrum exhibits extremely blue-slope in the VIS-NIR region (so-called
Phaethon Blue). Another candidate large member of the PGC, (155140) 2005 UD,
shows a B/F-type color, however with a C-type-like red color over its ~1/4
rotational part, which implies an exposition of less metamorphosed primordial
internal structure of the PGC precursor by a splitting or breakup event long
ago. If so, some rotational part of Phaethon should show the C-type color as
well as 2005 UD. Hence, we carried out the time-series VIS-spectroscopic
observations of Phaethon using 1-m telescope in order to detect such a
signature. Also, R-band photometries were simultaneously performed in order to
complement our spectroscopy. Consequently, we obtained a total of 68
VIS-spectrophotometric data, 78% of which show the B-type blue-color, as
against the rest of 22% showing the C-type red-color. We successfully acquired
rotationally time-resolved spectroscopic data, of which particular rotational
phase shows a red-spectral slope as the C-type color, as 2005 UD does,
suggesting longitudinal inhomogeneity on Phaethon's surface. We constrained
this C-type red-colored area in the mid-latitude in Phaethon's southern
hemisphere based on the rotationally time-resolved spectroscopy along with
Phaethon's axial rotation state, of which size suggests the impact-induced
origin of the PGC. We also surveyed the meteoritic analog of Phaethon's surface
blue-color, and found thermally metamorphosed CI/CM chondrites as likely
candidates.

denoising. However, most existing methods only consider the nonlocal
self-similarity (NSS) prior of noisy input image. That is, the similar patches
are collected only from degraded input, which makes the quality of image
denoising largely depend on the input itself. However, such methods often
suffer from a common drawback that the denoising performance may degrade
quickly with increasing noise levels. In this paper we propose a new prior
model, called group sparsity residual constraint (GSRC). Unlike the
conventional group-based sparse representation denoising methods, two kinds of
prior, namely, the NSS priors of noisy and pre-filtered images, are used in
GSRC. In particular, we integrate these two NSS priors through the mechanism of
sparsity residual, and thus, the task of image denoising is converted to the
problem of reducing the group sparsity residual. To this end, we first obtain a
good estimation of the group sparse coefficients of the original image by
pre-filtering, and then the group sparse coefficients of the noisy image are
used to approximate this estimation. To improve the accuracy of the nonlocal
similar patch selection, an adaptive patch search scheme is designed.
Furthermore, to fuse these two NSS prior better, an effective iterative
shrinkage algorithm is developed to solve the proposed GSRC model. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed GSRC modeling outperforms many
state-of-the-art denoising methods in terms of the objective and the perceptual
metrics.

cases are known but we give a more complete answer. We concentrate on
near-critical cases where the mean number of offspring is $1+\mu/T$ for some
$\mu\in\mathbb{R}$, and show that a scaling limit exists as $T\to\infty$.
Viewed backwards in time, the resulting coalescent process is topologically
equivalent to Kingman's coalescent, but the times of coalescence have an
interesting and highly non-trivial structure. The randomly fluctuating
population size, as opposed to constant size populations where the Kingman
coalescent more usually arises, have a pronounced effect on both the results
and the method of proof required. We give explicit formulas for the

Because of the disturbances in the measurement, the problem of designing
dynamic controllers is considered so that the closed-loop system is robust with
respect to measurement errors. Assuming that the disturbance is a locally
essentially bounded measurable function of time, we derive a
disturbance-to-state estimate which provides an upper bound on the maximum norm

based on constructing a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, which
leads to controller synthesis and the conditions on system dynamics required
for stability. As an application of this stability notion, the problem of
quantized control for hyperbolic PDEs is considered where the measurements sent

presence of quantizer yields practical stability only, and the ultimate bounds

introduction of many degrees of freedom, couplings and mass scales. In stark
contrast to $\Lambda$CDM, for natural values of the parameters, the model
attains transient accelerated expansion, which avoids the future horizon
problem, while it maintains the field displacement mildly sub-Planckian such
that the flatness of the quintessential tail is not lifted by radiative
corrections and violations of the equivalence principle (fifth force) are under
control. In particular, the required value of the cosmological constant is near
the eletroweak scale. Attention is paid to the reheating of the Universe, which
avoids gravitino overproduction and respects nucleosynthesis constraints.
Kination is treated in a model independent way. A spike in gravitational waves,
due to kination, is found not to disturb nucleosynthesis as well.

measurement at a given spacetime point. It is customarily assumed that this
collapse occurs along an equal-time hypersurface, say, t = 0. However, such a
na\""ive instantaneous collapse process is inconsistent with relativity, because
the equal-time hypersurfaces of different inertial reference frames are
different. The attempts at implementation of instantaneous collapse in several
different reference frames then lead to violations of probability conservation
and violations of the scalar character of the probability contained in given
volume elements. This problem affects not only the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics, but also other interpretations in which it is still
necessary to specify what changes in probabilities occur when and where in a
manner consistent with relativistic spacetime geometry. In the 1980s Schlieder
and Hellwig and Kraus proposed that collapse of the probability distribution
along the past light cone of the measurement point avoids these difficulties
and leads to a Lorentz-invariant collapse scenario. Their proposal received
little attention and some negative criticisms. In this paper I argue that the
proposed past-light cone collapse is not only reasonable, but is compelled by
Lorentz invariance of probability conservation, and is equally valid for the
spatial probability distributions in quantum mechanics and for those in a game
of chance, for instance, the probability distribution for a game with playing
cards scattered over some spatial region. I examine the objections that have
been made to the past-light-cone collapse scenario and show that these
objections are not valid. Finally, I propose two possible interferometer
experiments that can serve as direct tests of past-light-cone collapse, one
with an atom interferometer, and the other with a light interferometer.

spectral behavior of COTS, observed as reflection resonances, is described by
the temporal coupled-mode theory. Mode coupling is different for two circular
light polarizations because COTS has a helix structure replicating that of the
cholesteric. The mode coupling for co-handed circularly polarized light
exponentially attenuates with the cholesteric layer thickness since the COTS
frequency falls into the stop band. Cross-handed circularly polarized light
freely goes through the cholesteric layer and can excite COTS when reflected
from the handedness-preserving mirror. The coupling in this case is
proportional to anisotropy of the cholesteric and theoretically it is only
anisotropy of magnetic permittivity that can ultimately cancel this coupling.
These two couplings being equal results in a polarization crossover (the
Kopp--Genack effect) for which a linear polarization is optimal to excite COTS.
The corresponding cholesteric thickness and scattering matrix for COTS are
generally described by simple expressions.

morphology and an estimated age of 0.1 Gyr at a galactocentric distance of
about 35 kpc. A nearby intermediate-age globular cluster, surrounded by weak
line emission and a few more young star clusters, is kinematically associated.
The origin of this complex is enigmatic. The nebular emission lines permit a
metallicity determination which can discriminate between a dwarf galaxy or
other possible precursors. We used the Integrated Field Unit of the VIMOS
instrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory to
study the morphology, kinematics, and metallicity employing line maps, velocity
maps, and line diagnostics of a few characteristic spectra. The line ratios of
different spectra vary, indicating highly structured HII regions, but define a
locus of uniform metallicity. The strong-line diagnostic diagrams and empirical
calibrations point to a nearly solar or even super-solar oxygen abundance. The
velocity dispersion of the gas is highest in the region offset from the bright
clusters. Star formation may be active on a low level. There is evidence for a
large-scale disk-like structure in the region of SH2, which would make the
similar radial velocity of the nearby globular cluster easier to understand.
The high metallicity does not fit to a dwarf galaxy as progenitor. We favour
the scenario of a free-floating gaseous complex having its origin in the merger
2 Gyr ago. Over a long period the densities increased secularly until finally
the threshold for star formation was reached. SH2 illustrates how massive star
clusters can form outside starbursts and without a considerable field
population.

irradiation processes such as sputtering; roughness can significantly increase
the angle of maximum sputtering and change the maximum observed sputtering
yield by a factor of 2 or more. The complete effect of surface roughness on
sputtering and other ion irradiation phenomena is not completely understood.
Many rough surfaces can be consistently and realistically modeled by fractals,
using the fractal dimension and fractal length scale as the sole input
parameters. F-TRIDYN includes a robust fractal surface algorithm that is more
computationally efficient than those in previous fractal codes and which
reproduces available experimental sputtering data from rough surfaces. Fractals
provide a compelling path toward a complete and concise understanding of the

quantum-disordered states. A representative case is liquid helium, in which
zero-point vibrations of the helium atoms prevent its solidification at low
temperatures. A similar behaviour is found for the internal degrees of freedom
in electrons. Among the most prominent is a quantum spin liquid (QSL), in which
localized spins are highly correlated but fluctuate even at absolute zero.
Recently, a coupling of spins with other degrees of freedom has been proposed
as an innovative approach to generate even more fascinating QSLs such as
orbital--spin liquids. However, such ideas are limited to the internal degrees
of freedom in electrons. Here, we demonstrate that a coupling of localized
spins with the zero-point motion of hydrogen atoms (proton fluctuations) in a
hydrogen-bonded organic Mott insulator provides a new class of QSLs. We find
that a divergent dielectric behaviour towards a hydrogen-bond order is
suppressed by the quantum proton fluctuations, resulting in a quantum
paraelectric (QPE) state. Furthermore, our thermal-transport measurements
reveal that a QSL state with gapless spin excitations rapidly emerges upon

reconstructions for hyperbolic systems of balance laws. We are particularly
interested in high order shock capturing non-oscillatory schemes with uniform
accuracy within each cell and low spurious effects. We need therefore to
develop a tool to measure the artifacts introduced by a numerical scheme. To
this end, we study the deformation of a single Fourier mode and introduce the
notion of distorsive errors, which measure the amplitude of the spurious modes
created by a discrete derivative operator. Further we refine this notion with
the idea of temperature, in which the amplitude of the spurious modes is
weighted with its distance in frequency space from the exact mode. Following
this approach linear schemes have zero temperature, but to prevent oscillations
it is necessary to introduce nonlinearities in the scheme, thus increasing
their temperature. However it is important to heat the linear scheme just
enough to prevent spurious oscillations. With several tests we show that the
newly introduced CWENOZ schemes are cooler than other existing WENO-type
operators, while maintaining good non-oscillatory properties.

That is, the initial-condition-to-solution map might become discontinuous in

employed, then standard ODE theory implies that such models are well-posed and
can thus, approximately, be solved with finite precision arithmetic. We
investigate whether the solution of this well-posed model converges to a
solution of the ill-posed limit problem as the steepness parameter, of the
firing rate function, tends to infinity. Our argument employs the
Arzel\`{a}-Ascoli theorem and also yields the existence of a solution of the
limit problem. However, we only obtain convergence of a subsequence of the
regularized solutions. This is consistent with the fact that we show that
models with a Heaviside firing rate function can have several solutions. Our
analysis assumes that the Lebesgue measure of the time the limit function,
provided by the Arzel\`{a}-Ascoli theorem, equals the threshold value for
firing, is zero. If this assumption does not hold, we argue that the

that $M$ is also asymptotically harmonic manifold with minimal horospheres

criterion: $\{{e_i}\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $T_{p}M$ and $\{b_{e_{i}}\}$
be the corresponding Busemann functions on $M$. Then, (1) The vector space $V =

an isometry and therefore, $M$ is flat. Consequently, AH manifolds can have
either polynomial or exponential volume growth,generalizing the corresponding
result of [18] for harmonic manifolds. In case of harmonic manifold with
minimal horospheres (HM), the (second order) flatness was proved in [23] by
showing that $span\{b_{v}^2 | v \in T_{p}M \}$ is finite dimensional. We
conclude that, the results obtained in this paper are the strongest and wider

subexponential volume growth, then M is a first order flat manifold.

superconducting resonators. Recently, there have been many efforts to extend
these demonstrations to the motion of complex, macroscopic objects. These
mechanical objects have important applications as quantum memories or
transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. In
particular, there have been a few experiments that couple motion to nonlinear
quantum objects such as superconducting qubits. This opens up the possibility
of creating, storing, and manipulating non-Gaussian quantum states in
mechanical degrees of freedom. However, before sophisticated quantum control of
mechanical motion can be achieved, we must realize systems with long coherence
times while maintaining a sufficient interaction strength. These systems should
be implemented in a simple and robust manner that allows for increasing
complexity and scalability in the future. Here we experimentally demonstrate a
high frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a
superconducting qubit using piezoelectric transduction. In contrast to previous
experiments with qubit-mechanical systems, our device requires only simple
fabrication methods, extends coherence times to many microseconds, and provides
controllable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We use this system to
demonstrate basic quantum operations on the coupled qubit-phonon system.
Straightforward improvements to the current device will allow for advanced

intermodal coupling is considered. The system is not invariant under the
conventional $PT$ symmetry but obeys $CPT$ symmetry where an additional spatial
inversion $C$ corresponds to swapping the coupler arms. We show that
second-order dispersion of coupling allows for unbroken $CPT$ symmetry and
supports propagation of stable vector solitons along the coupler.
Small-amplitude solitons are found in explicit form. The combined effect of
gain-and-loss and dispersive coupling results in several interesting features
which include a separation between the components in different arms, nontrivial
dependence of stability of a soliton on its velocity, and the existence of more
complex stationary two-hump solutions. Unusual decay dynamics of unstable
solitons is discussed too.

limits (L=0.2L*, or equivalently M1500~-19). We have measured through stacks a
stringent upper limit (<1.7% at 1sigma) for the relative escape fraction of HI
ionizing photons from bright galaxies (L>L*), while for the faint population
(L=0.2L*) the limit to the escape fraction is ~10%. We have computed the

we have found that it is not enough to keep the Universe ionized at these

prograde-retrograde inclination flip (due to Lidov-Kozai like oscillations).

Basing on the idea of the complexity of a number, defined as the number of its
digits, we introduce a function noted $\mu$ (called a measure of intelligence)
associating to any approximation $\mathbf{app}$ of a given real number in a
given model a positive number $\mu(\mathbf{app})$, which characterises the
intelligence of that approximation. Precisely, the approximation $\mathbf{app}$
is intelligent if and only if $\mu(\mathbf{app}) \geq 1$. We illustrate our
theory by several numerical examples and also by applying it to the rational
model. In such case, we show that it is coherent with the classical rational
diophantine approximation. We end the paper by proposing an open problem which
asks if any real number can be intelligently approximated in a given model for
which it is a limit point.

specific organ site, we now understand that there are many subtypes of cancer
defined by unique patterns of gene mutations. These gene mutational data, which
can be more reliably obtained than gene expression data, help to determine how
the subtypes develop, evolve, and respond to therapies. Different from dense
continuous-value gene expression data, which most existing cancer subtype
discovery algorithms use, somatic mutational data are extremely sparse and
heterogeneous, because there are less than 0.5\% mutated genes in discrete
value 1/0 out of 20,000 human protein-coding genes, and identical mutated genes
are rarely shared by cancer patients.
  Our focus is to search for cancer subtypes from extremely sparse and high
dimensional gene mutational data in discrete 1 and 0 values using unsupervised
learning. We propose a new network-based distance metric. We project cancer
patients' mutational profile into their gene network structure and measure the
distance between two patients using the similarity between genes and between
the gene vertexes of the patients in the network. Experimental results in
synthetic data and real-world data show that our approach outperforms the top
competitors in cancer subtype discovery. Furthermore, our approach can identify
cancer subtypes that cannot be detected by other clustering algorithms in real
cancer data.

modular forms go back to the mid 1960's, most of the fundamental problems
surrounding their theory are still wide open. Only for certain types of Bianchi
modular forms, which we will call non-genuine, it is possible at present to
develop dimension formulas: They are (twists of) those forms which arise from
elliptic cuspidal modular forms via the Langlands Base-Change procedure, or
arise from a quadratic extension of the imaginary quadratic field via
automorphic induction (so-called CM-forms). The remaining Bianchi modular forms
are what we call genuine, and they are of interest for an extension of the
modularity theorem (formerly the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, crucial in the
proof of Femat's Last Theorem) to imaginary quadratic fields. In a preceding
paper by Rahm and Sengun, an extreme paucity of genuine cuspidal Bianchi
modular forms has been reported, but those and other computations were
