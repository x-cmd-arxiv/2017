material for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications. The large-area
growth of MoS$_2$ has been demonstrated using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
in a wide range of deposition temperatures from 600 {\deg}C to 1000 {\deg}C.
However, a direct comparison of growth parameters and resulting material
properties has not been made so far. Here, we present a systematic experimental
and theoretical investigation of optical properties of monolayer MoS$_2$ grown
at different temperatures. Micro-Raman and photoluminescence (PL) studies
reveal observable inhomogeneities in optical properties of the as-grown single
crystalline grains of MoS$_2$. Close examination of the Raman and PL features
clearly indicate that growth-induced strain is the main source of distinct
optical properties. We carry out density functional theory calculations to
describe the interaction of growing MoS$_2$ layers with the growth substrate as
the origin of strain. Our work explains the variation of band gap energies of
CVD-grown monolayer MoS$_2$, extracted using PL spectroscopy, as a function of
deposition temperature. The methodology has general applicability to model and
predict the influence of growth conditions on strain in 2D materials.

temperature-dependent thermodynamic free energy, and we also consider the
effect of dispersion forces on the energetics. The recently identified
{\pi}-cubic phase of SnS is found to be metastable with respect to the
well-known orthorhombic Pnma/Cmcm equilibrium. The Cmcm phase is a low-lying
saddle point between Pnma minima on the potential-energy surface, and is
observed as an average structure at high temperatures. Bulk rocksalt and
zincblende phases are found to be dynamically unstable, and we show that
whereas rocksalt SnS can potentially be stabilised under a reduction of the
lattice constant, the hypothetical zincblende phase proposed in several earlier
studies is extremely unlikely to form. We also investigate the stability of
Sn2S3 with respect to SnS and SnS2, and find that both dispersion forces and
vibrational contributions to the free energy are required to explain its
experimentally-observed resistance to decomposition.

  during recombination",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The 5 independent correlations between the properties of galaxies observed
outside big clusters must set such strong constraints on any theory of galaxy
formation that it is hard to imagine any but the right one passing muster;
certainly the standard model of Hierarchical Formation does not. Furthermore
those global correlations imply that such galaxies must be remarkably simple,
i.e. have virtually all of their variance attributable to a single Principal
Component. That being so the correlations ought to give strong hints as to the
process of formation. Two in particular: all galaxies have the same
Luminosity-Density, while Luminosity and Dynamical Mass are everywhere tightly
correlated, hint that formation took place at the epoch of Recombination.
Halving of particle numbers then will set up strong pressure-forces which could
fragment the medium and halt the expansion of neutral fragments, if they are
not too large. We find that fragments between $10^{11} $ and $10^{6} $ solar
masses (baryonic) will collapse gravitationally upon themselves, mostly
flattening in one dimension, to form galaxies between 10 kpc. and 0.3 kpc. in
size, and in two distinct classes. Those below $10^{8}$ solar masses will
remain transparent and cool, eventually sub-fragmenting into stars with a warm,
spheroidal distribution, while those above will become opaque and thus too hot
to form stars until after they have radiated away most of their axial binding
energy. They will then settle into thin discs with a low axial velocity
dispersion. This simple scenario generates most of the properties of the
galaxies but not flat rotation-curves. Finally we attempt to weigh up its pros
and cons as a viable theory of galaxy formation and conclude that it is much
superior to the Hierarchical model when it comes to fitting most observations.
At the very least it deserves further critical evaluation.

  Privacy","To appear in PETS 2017",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information about people's movements and the locations they visit enables an
increasing number of mobility analytics applications, e.g., in the context of
urban and transportation planning, In this setting, rather than collecting or
sharing raw data, entities often use aggregation as a privacy protection
mechanism, aiming to hide individual users' location traces. Furthermore, to
bound information leakage from the aggregates, they can perturb the input of
the aggregation or its output to ensure that these are differentially private.
  In this paper, we set to evaluate the impact of releasing aggregate location
time-series on the privacy of individuals contributing to the aggregation. We
introduce a framework allowing us to reason about privacy against an adversary
attempting to predict users' locations or recover their mobility patterns. We
formalize these attacks as inference problems, and discuss a few strategies to
model the adversary's prior knowledge based on the information she may have
access to. We then use the framework to quantify the privacy loss stemming from
aggregate location data, with and without the protection of differential
privacy, using two real-world mobility datasets. We find that aggregates do
leak information about individuals' punctual locations and mobility profiles.
The density of the observations, as well as timing, play important roles, e.g.,
regular patterns during peak hours are better protected than sporadic
movements. Finally, our evaluation shows that both output and input
perturbation offer little additional protection, unless they introduce large
amounts of noise ultimately destroying the utility of the data.

locations are always strategically selected. For those aiming at inferring
certain quantities of interest (QoI), it is desirable to explore the dependency
between sensor measurements and QoI. One of the most popular metric for the
dependency is mutual information which naturally measures how much information
about one variable can be obtained given the other. However, computing mutual
information is always challenging, and the result is unreliable in high
dimension. In this paper, we propose an approach to find an approximate lower
bound of mutual information and compute it in a lower dimension. Then, sensors
are placed where highest mutual information (lower bound) is achieved and QoI
is inferred via Bayes rule given sensor measurements. In addition, Bayesian
optimization is introduced to provide a continuous mutual information surface
over the domain and thus reduce the number of evaluations. A chemical release
accident is simulated where multiple sensors are placed to locate the source of
the release. The result shows that the proposed approach is both effective and
efficient in inferring QoI.

storage- and messaging solution with integrity geared access control for a
scalable forensic framework is researched. The Open Computer Forensics
Architecture (OCFA),a lab-side scalable computer forensics framework,
introduced the concept of a message passing concurrency based forensic
framework. Since then, the amount of per-investigation data to be processed in
a lab environment has continued to grow significantly while available RAM and
CPU processing power combined with prohibitive cost and limited capacity of SSD
solutions have shifted processing from being largely CPU constrained to being
much more IO constrained. OCFA suffered from several page-cache-miss related
performance issues that have grown more significant as a result of this shift.
In the light of anti-forensics and general issues related to process integrity,
OCFA did not leverage the power of its message passing based design to address
integrity concerns.
  The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyze and evaluate a number of
page-cache friendly technologies that could contribute to the creation of a
computer forensics lab-geared scalable message-passing-concurrency based
forensic framework with a significantly reduced quantity of page-cache-miss
induced spurious IO operations, taking into account integrity related issues.
  Provenance logs from historic investigations conducted using the Open
Computer Forensics Architecture were thoroughly analyzed in this study, during
which several bottlenecks and design flaws in OCFA were identified. A number of
strategies were devised to address these bottlenecks in future computer
forensic frameworks. Finally, the most prominently page-cache related
strategies were consolidated with access-control measures into a user-space
file-system and low-level API prototype.

concealing information by embedding it within a non-secret medium, such as
cover texts or images. We show that adversarial training can produce robust
steganographic techniques: our unsupervised training scheme produces a
steganographic algorithm that competes with state-of-the-art steganographic
techniques, and produces a robust steganalyzer, which performs the
discriminative task of deciding if an image contains secret information. We
define a game between three parties, Alice, Bob and Eve, in order to
simultaneously train both a steganographic algorithm and a steganalyzer. Alice
and Bob attempt to communicate a secret message contained within an image,
while Eve eavesdrops on their conversation and attempts to determine if secret
information is embedded within the image. We represent Alice, Bob and Eve by
neural networks, and validate our scheme on two independent image datasets,
showing our novel method of studying steganographic problems is surprisingly

manipulation of digital images becomes an important concern, there is also a
big issue of image source origin authentication. This paper proposes a
procedure for the identification of the image source and content by using the
Public Key Cryptography Signature (PKCS). The procedure is based on the PKCS
watermarking of the images captured with numerous automatic observing cameras
in the Trap View cloud system. Watermark is created based on 32-bit PKCS serial
number and embedded into the captured image. Watermark detection on the
receiver side extracts the serial number and indicates the camera which
captured the image by comparing the original and the extracted serial numbers.
The watermarking procedure is designed to provide robustness to image
optimization based on the Compressive Sensing approach. Also, the procedure is
tested under various attacks and shows successful identification of ownership.

neutral biodiversity theory can often provide good fits to species abundance

focused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological
equivalence. However, neutrality in nature is also broken by differences
between conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many
communities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at
similar stages. These within-species asymmetries have not been fully explored
in species-neutral models, and it is not known whether demographic stage
structure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory. Here we present a
two-stage neutral model where fecundity and mortality change as an individual
transitions from one stage to the other. We explore several qualitatively
different scenarios, and compare numerically obtained species abundance
distributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral theory. We find that
abundance distributions are generally robust to this kind of stage structure,
but significant departures from unstructured predictions occur if adults have
sufficiently low fecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the
cumulative number of births per species, which is distributed as a power law
with a 3/2 exponent, is invariant even when the abundance distribution departs
from unstructured model predictions. Our findings potentially explain power
law-like abundance distributions in organisms with strong demographic
structure, such as eusocial insects and humans, and partially rehabilitate
species abundance distributions from past criticisms as to their inability to
distinguish between biological mechanisms.

dominant electromagnetic component; a subdominant thermal component

thin shell forms that expands subluminally, attaining a Lorentz factor $\sim

i) reflection of the ambient magnetic field; ii) direct linear conversion of
the embedded magnetic field into a superluminal mode; and iii) excitation
outside the shell by corrugation of its surface. The escaping electromagnetic
pulse is very narrow (a few wavelengths) and so the width of the detected

precession is rapid. The collision rate of `spring' loops with tension ${\cal
T} \sim 10^{-8}c^4/G$ in galactic halos approaches the measured rate of fast

superconducting dipole (LSD) with mass $\sim 10^{20}$ g and size $\sim 1$ mm
will form a $\sim 100$ km magnetosphere moving through interstellar plasma.
Although hydromagnetic drag is generally weak, it is strong enough to capture
some LSDs into long-lived rings orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that
form by the direct collapse of massive gas clouds. Repeated collisions near
young SMBHs could dominate the global collision rate, thereby broadening the
dipole mass spectrum. Colliding LSDs produce tiny, hot electromagnetic
explosions. The accompanying paper shows that these explosions couple
effectively to propagating low-frequency electromagnetic modes, with output
peaking at 0.01-1 THz. We describe several constraints on, and predictions of,
LSDs as cosmic dark matter. The shock formed by an infalling LSD triggers
self-sustained thermonuclear burning in a C/O (ONeMg) white dwarf (WD) of mass

general linear systems with delays where input-output approaches provide, in

for the characterization of diagonal Riccati stability for systems with
discrete-delays and generalize this equation to other types of delay systems.
The fact that all those results can be reproved in a very simple way
demonstrates the importance and the efficiency of the input-output framework
for the analysis of linear positive systems. The approach is also used to
derive performance results evaluated in terms of the $L_1$-, $L_2$- and
$L_\infty$-gains. It is also flexible enough to be used for design purposes.

this aspect is that our frameworks can, in theory, employ fixed stepsizes,
which makes the methods readily translatable from deterministic to stochastic
settings. For deterministic problems, we show that instances of our dynamic
framework yield gains in performance compared to related methods that only
follow descent steps. We also show that gains can be made in a stochastic

  Experiments","updated to match publication version",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary science goal of the NASA-sponsored ANITA project is measurement
of ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, observed via radio-frequency
signals resulting from a neutrino- or cosmic ray- interaction with terrestrial
matter (atmospheric or ice molecules, e.g.). Accurate inference of the energies
of these cosmic rays requires understanding the transmission/reflection of
radio wave signals across the ice-air boundary. Satellite-based measurements of
Antarctic surface reflectivity, using a co-located transmitter and receiver,
have been performed more-or-less continuously for the last few decades.
Satellite-based reflectivity surveys, at frequencies ranging from 2--45 GHz and
at near-normal incidence, yield generally consistent reflectivity maps across
Antarctica. Using the Sun as an RF source, and the ANITA-3 balloon borne
radio-frequency antenna array as the RF receiver, we have also measured the
surface reflectivity over the interval 200-1000 MHz, at elevation angles of
12-30 degrees, finding agreement with the Fresnel equations within systematic
errors. To probe low incidence angles, inaccessible to the Antarctic Solar
technique and not probed by previous satellite surveys, a novel experimental
approach (""HiCal-1"") was devised. Unlike previous measurements, HiCal-ANITA
constitute a bi-static transmitter-receiver pair separated by hundreds of
kilometers. Data taken with HiCal, between 200--600 MHz shows a significant
departure from the Fresnel equations, constant with frequency over that band,
with the deficit increasing with obliquity of incidence, which we attribute to
the combined effects of possible surface roughness, surface grain effects,
radar clutter and/or shadowing of the reflection zone due to Earth curvature
effects.

have also suggested an idealized and more realistic experiments to detect the
above mentioned inequivalence for a passive gravitational mass. The suggested
idealized effect is as follows. A spacecraft moves protons of a macroscopic
ensemble of hydrogen atoms with constant velocity in the Earth's gravitational
field. Due to non-homogeneous squeezing of space by the field, electron ground
state wave function experiences time-dependent perturbation in each hydrogen
atom. This perturbation results in the appearance of a finite probability for
an electron to be excited at higher energy levels and to emit a photon. The
experimental task is to detect such photons from the ensemble of the atoms.
More realistic variants of such experiment can be realized in solid crystals
and nuclei, as first mentioned by us. In his recent Comment on our paper,
Crowell has argued that the effect, suggested by us, contradicts the existing
experiments and, in particular, astronomic data. We show here that this
conclusion is incorrect and based on the so-called ""free fall"" experiments,
where our effect does not have to be observed.

lower bandwidth to regenerate lost data fragments compared to file replication

repair is initiated after a threshold number of data fragments have been lost

lazy repair strategy in which repairs are initiated after several nodes have
left the system outperforms eager repair in which repairs are initiated after a
single departure. This optimality is reversed when nodes are highly mobile. We
further compare distributed and centralized repair strategies and derive the
optimal repair threshold for minimizing the average repair cost per unit of
time, as a function of underlying code parameters. In addition, we examine
cooperative repair strategies and show performance improvements compared to
non-cooperative codes. We investigate several models for the time needed for
node repair including a simple fixed time model that allows for the computation
of closed-form expressions and a more realistic model that takes into account
the number of repaired nodes. We derive the conditions under which the former

failures are allowed during the repair process is investigated. Overall, our
results establish the joint effect of code design and repair algorithms on the

  We perform a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of
turbulence driven with various degrees of compressibility. The average
conditions in the simulations are representative of models of merging binary
white dwarfs.
  We find that material with very short ignition times is abundant in the case
that turbulence is driven compressively. This material forms contiguous
structures that persist over many ignition times, and that we identify as
prospective detonation kernels. Detailed analysis of prospective kernels
reveals that these objects are centrally-condensed and their shape is
characterized by low curvature, supportive of self-sustained detonations. The
key characteristic of the newly proposed detonation mechanism is thus high
degree of compressibility of turbulent drive.
  The simulated detonation kernels have sizes notably smaller than the spatial
resolution of any white dwarf merger simulation performed to date. The
resolution required to resolve kernels is 0.1 km. Our results indicate a high
probability of detonations in such well-resolved simulations of carbon-oxygen
white dwarf mergers. These simulations will likely produce detonations in
systems of lower total mass, thus broadening the population of white dwarf
binaries capable of producing Type Ia supernovae. Consequently, we expect a
downward revision of the lower limit of the total merger mass that is capable
of producing a prompt detonation.
  We review application of the new detonation mechanism to various explosion
scenarios of single, Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs.

bremsstrahlung was incident on a cryogenic hydrogen target within the CEBAF

1.516 to 1.836 GeV for the $\gamma p \to \eta^\prime p$ reaction. For $\gamma p
\to \eta p$, the data reported here considerably extend the range of
measurements to higher energies, and are consistent with the few previously
published measurements for this observable near threshold. For $\gamma p \to
\eta^\prime p$, the results obtained are consistent with the few previously
published measurements for this observable near threshold, but also greatly
expand the incident photon energy coverage for that reaction. Initial analysis
of the data reported here with the Bonn-Gatchina model strengthens the evidence

outperforms other known optimization algorithms even on unseen tasks and is
robust to changes in stochasticity of gradients and the neural net

the information about the signal can be represented using a small set of

The signal concentration in the Hermite domain and consequently, the number of

performing the parametization of the Hermite transform. For the comparison

phase-space attractor, ""slow roll"", which washes out the dependence on initial
field velocities. We investigate the robustness of this property under
backreaction from quantum fluctuations using the stochastic inflation formalism
in the phase-space approach. A Hamiltonian formulation of stochastic inflation
is presented, where it is shown that the coarse-graining procedure - where
wavelengths smaller than the Hubble radius are integrated out - preserves the
canonical structure of free fields. This means that different sets of canonical
variables give rise to the same probability distribution which clarifies the
literature with respect to this issue. The role played by the
quantum-to-classical transition is also analysed and is shown to constrain the
coarse-graining scale. In the case of free fields, we find that quantum
diffusion is aligned in phase space with the slow-roll direction. This implies
that the classical slow-roll attractor is immune to stochastic effects and thus
generalises to a stochastic attractor regardless of initial conditions, with a
relaxation time at least as short as in the classical system. For non-test
fields or for test fields with non-linear self interactions however, quantum
diffusion and the classical slow-roll flow are misaligned. We derive a
condition on the coarse-graining scale so that observational corrections from
this misalignment are negligible at leading order in slow roll.

the self-annihilation of X to pairs of quarks and gluons through the strong
interaction. The phenomenology of these scenarios therefore only depends on the
dark matter mass and the mass splitting between dark matter and X as well as
the quantum numbers of X. In this paper, we consider simplified models where X
can be either a scalar, a fermion or a vector, as well as a color triplet,
sextet or octet. We compute the dark matter relic density constraints taking
into account Sommerfeld corrections and bound state formation. Furthermore, we
examine the restrictions from thermal equilibrium, the lifetime of X and the
current and future LHC bounds on X pair production. All constraints are
comprehensively presented in the mass splitting versus dark matter mass plane.
While the relic density constraints can lead to upper bounds on the dark matter
mass ranging from 2 TeV to more than 10 TeV across our models, the prospective
LHC bounds range from 800 to 1500 GeV. A full coverage of the strongly
coannihilating dark matter parameter space would therefore require hadron

various estimators that achieve good rates of convergence. Our main
contribution complements this literature with the construction of simultaneous

FPGAs interconnected by a high speed transceiver mesh. It provides up to ~4
TMACs with Altera Stratix IV FPGA and 160 Gbps data rate for the input data

real-time and go-through detectors (i.e. no iterative processing) can be
implemented. In this paper, a real-time and adaptive detection scheme is
described.
  An ongoing case study has been set up with the Electronic Multi-Beam Radio

The objective is to evaluate the performances of this concept in term of
hardware complexity, detection efficiency and additional RFI metadata rate

Asteroid Belt is (4) Vesta, that is located in the inner part of the belt.
However, many V-type asteroids cannot be dynamically linked to Vesta., in
particular, those asteroids located in the middle and outer parts of the Belt.
Previous works have failed to find mechanisms to transport V-type asteroids
from the inner to the middle and outer belt. In this work we propose a
dynamical mechanism that could have acted on primordial asteroid families. We
consider a model of the giant planets migration known as the jumping Jupiter
model with five planets. Our study is focused on the period of 10 Myr that
encompasses the instability phase of the giant planets. We show that, for
different hypothetical Vesta-like paleo-families in the inner belt, the
perturbations caused by the ice giant that is scattered into the asteroid belt
before being ejected from the solar system, are able to scatter V-type
asteroids to the middle and outer belt. Based on the orbital distribution of
V-type candidates identified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the VISTA
Survey colours, we show that this mechanism is efficient enough provided that
the hypothetical paleo-family originated from a 100 to 500 km crater excavated
on the surface of (4) Vesta. This mechanism is able to explain the currently
observed V-type asteroids in the middle and outer belt, with the exception of

cross-section determines the residual symmetric component of dark matter, which

in the hybrid state.
  Methods: First, we constructed visual representations to elucidate the
differential equation that governs spin dynamics in hybrid state. Subsequently,
numerical optimizations were performed to find spin ensemble trajectories that
minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound for $T_1$-encoding, $T_2$-encoding, and their
weighted sum, respectively, followed by a comparison of the Cram\'er-Rao bounds
obtained with our optimized spin-trajectories, as well as Look-Locker and
multi-spin-echo methods. Finally, we experimentally tested our optimized spin
trajectories with in vivo scans of the human brain.
  Results: After a nonrecurring inversion segment on the southern hemisphere of
the Bloch sphere, all optimized spin trajectories pursue repetitive loops on
the northern half of the sphere in which the beginning of the first and the end
of the last loop deviate from the others. The numerical results obtained in
this work align well with intuitive insights gleaned directly from the
governing equation. Our results suggest that hybrid-state sequences outperform
traditional methods. Moreover, hybrid-state sequences that balance $T_1$- and
$T_2$-encoding still result in near optimal signal-to-noise efficiency. Thus,
the second parameter can be encoded at virtually no extra cost.
  Conclusion: We provide insights regarding the optimal encoding processes of
spin relaxation times in order to guide the design of robust and efficient
pulse sequences. We find that joint acquisitions of $T_1$ and $T_2$ in the
hybrid state are substantially more efficient than sequential encoding
techniques.

that the optical, catalytic, and thermal functionalities of TMDC monolayers can

discover two major roles of the intercalated species in the enhancement: doping
the monolayers and modifying the interaction of the monolayers with the

units of a resource available over time. Selfish clients submit jobs, each with
an arrival time, deadline, length, and value. The service provider's goal is to
implement a truthful online mechanism for scheduling jobs so as to maximize the
social welfare of the schedule. Recent work shows that under a stochastic
assumption on job arrivals, there is a single-parameter family of mechanisms
that achieves near-optimal social welfare. We show that given any such family
of near-optimal online mechanisms, there exists an online mechanism that in the
worst case performs nearly as well as the best of the given mechanisms. Our
mechanism is truthful whenever the mechanisms in the given family are truthful
and prompt, and achieves optimal (within constant factors) regret.
  We model the problem of competing against a family of online scheduling
mechanisms as one of learning from expert advice. A primary challenge is that
any scheduling decisions we make affect not only the payoff at the current
step, but also the resource availability and payoffs in future steps.
Furthermore, switching from one algorithm (a.k.a. expert) to another in an
online fashion is challenging both because it requires synchronization with the
state of the latter algorithm as well as because it affects the incentive
structure of the algorithms. We further show how to adapt our algorithm to a
non-clairvoyant setting where job lengths are unknown until jobs are run to
completion. Once again, in this setting, we obtain truthfulness along with
asymptotically optimal regret (within poly-logarithmic factors).

exhibits a bandgap as a consequence of the effective feedback mechanism due to
the opposite directionality of the phase velocity and Poynting vector in the

multiple stable states increase with the strength of the nonlinear saturation.
Taking the advantage of multiple stable states, one can construct ultrafast

modern era, astronomical research has benefitted tremendously from electronic
cameras that allow data and images to be generated and analyzed in a purely

image-processing software have also enabled color-composite images to be made
in ways much more complex than with darkroom techniques, not only at optical
wavelengths but across the electromagnetic spectrum. And the internet has made
it possible to rapidly disseminate these images to eager audiences.
  Alongside these technological advances, there have been gains in
understanding how to make images that are scientifically illustrative as well
as aesthetically pleasing. Studies have also given insights on how the public
interprets astronomical images, and how that can be different than professional
astronomers. An understanding of these differences will help in the creation of
images that are meaningful to both groups.

for example detailed asteroseismic investigations and the study of the
exoplanet census including small planets. This has also allowed to study the
minute photometric variability following the orbital motion in stellar binaries
and star-planet systems which is the subject of this review. We focus on
systems with a main sequence primary and a low-mass secondary, from a small
star to a massive planet. The orbital modulations are induced by a combination
of gravitational and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect, tidal
ellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal emission. Therefore, the
phase curve shape contains information about the companion's mass and
atmospheric characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical tool.
For example, phase curves can be used to detect and measure the mass of
short-period low-mass companions orbiting hot fast-rotating stars, out of reach
of other detection methods. Another interesting application of phase curves is
using the orbital phase modulations to look for non-transiting systems, which
comprise the majority of stellar binary and star-planet systems. We discuss the

an inequality involving the temperatures at which CP and the center symmetry

classicality has been investigated for some time, if not well understood.
Recently in (PRL $\textbf{112}$, 010402, (2014)) it was pointed out that
coarse-graining measurements can lead to non-violation of Bell-type
inequalities by a state which would violate it under sharp measurements. We
study here the effects of coarse-grained measurements on bipartite cat states.
We show that while it is true that coarse-graining does indeed lead to
non-violation of a Bell-type inequality, this is not reflected at the state
level. Under such measurements the post-measurement states can be non-classical
(in the quantum optical sense) and in certain cases coarse-graning can lead to
an increase in this non-classicality with respect to the coarse-graining
parameter. While there is no universal way to quantify non-classicality, we do
so using well understood notions in quantum optics such as the negativity of
the Wigner function and the singular nature of the Gluaber-Sudharshan P

and evolution of a compact system of exoplanets smaller than the Earth. Five
planets transit this bright K star at close orbital distances, but they are too
small for their putative lower atmosphere to be probed at optical/infrared
wavelengths. We used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph instrument
onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for the signature of the planet's
upper atmospheres at six independent epochs in the Ly-$\alpha$ line. We detect
significant flux variations during the transits of both Kepler-444e and f
(~20%), and also at a time when none of the known planets was transiting
(~40%). Variability in the transition region and corona of the host star might
be the source of these variations. Yet, their amplitude over short time scales
(~2-3 hours) is surprisingly strong for this old (11.2+-1.0Gyr) and apparently
quiet main-sequence star. Alternatively, we show that the in-transits
variations could be explained by absorption from neutral hydrogen exospheres
trailing the two outer planets (Kepler-444e and f). They would have to contain
substantial amounts of water to replenish such hydrogen exospheres, which would
reveal them as the first confirmed ocean-planets. The out-of-transit
variations, however, would require the presence of a yet-undetected Kepler-444g
at larger orbital distance, casting doubt on the planetary origin scenario.
Using HARPS-N observations in the sodium doublet, we derived the properties of
two Interstellar Medium clouds along the line-of-sight toward Kepler-444. This
allowed us to reconstruct the stellar Ly-$\alpha$ line profile and to estimate
the XUV irradiation from the star, which would still allow for a moderate mass
loss from the outer planets after 11.2Gyr. Follow-up of the system at XUV

network topology design scheme that guarantee essentially optimal routing
scalability. The FIB sizes are as small as they can be, equal to the number of
adjacencies a node has, while the routing control overhead is minimized as
nearly zero routing control messages are exchanged even upon catastrophic
failures in the network. The key new ingredient is the addressing scheme, which
is purely local, based only on geographic coordinates of nodes and a centrality
measure, and does not require any sophisticated non-local computations or
global network topology knowledge for network embedding. The price paid for
these benefits is that network topology cannot be arbitrary but should follow a
specific design, resulting in Internet-like topologies. The proposed schemes
can be most easily deployed in overlay networks, and also in other network
deployments, where geolocation information is available, and where network
topology can grow following the design specifications.

creating these animations is the transition. In the transition approach,
animations are created by smoothly interpolating a visual attribute between a
start and end value, reaching the end value after a specified duration. This
approach works well when each transition for an attribute is allowed to finish
before the next is triggered, but performs poorly when a new transition is
triggered before the current transition has finished. In particular,
interruptions introduce velocity discontinuities, and frequent interruptions
can slow down the resulting animation. To solve these problems, we model the
problem of animation as a signal processing problem. In our technique,
animations are produced by transformations of signals, or functions over time.
In particular, an animation is produced by transforming an input signal, a
function from time to target attribute value, into an output signal, a function
from time to displayed attribute value. We show that well-known
signal-processing techniques can be applied to produce animations that are free
from velocity discontinuities even when interrupted.

layers or modules to be trained without update locking - without waiting for a
true error gradient to be backpropagated - resulting in Decoupled Neural
Interfaces (DNIs). This unlocked ability of being able to update parts of a
neural network asynchronously and with only local information was demonstrated
to work empirically in Jaderberg et al (2016). However, there has been very
little demonstration of what changes DNIs and SGs impose from a functional,
representational, and learning dynamics point of view. In this paper, we study
DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on feed-forward networks to better
understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect on optimisation. We show
that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational strength of
the learning system for a neural network, and prove the convergence of the
learning system for linear and deep linear models. On practical problems we
investigate the mechanism by which synthetic gradient estimators approximate
the true loss, and, surprisingly, how that leads to drastically different
layer-wise representations. Finally, we also expose the relationship of using
synthetic gradients to other error approximation techniques and find a unifying
language for discussion and comparison.

the years a number of objects have been found which deviate from normal SNe Ia
in their observational properties, and which require different and not seldom
more extreme progenitor systems. While the 'traditional' classes of peculiar
SNe Ia - luminous '91T-like' and faint '91bg-like' objects - have been known

About 60% of our sample have galaxy-wide values of kurtosis that are similar to

values, and kurtosis increases with integrated star formation rate. Kurtosis
and skewness were calculated for radial annuli and for a grid of 32 pixel X 32

skewness. For about half of the galaxies, there is a trend of increasing
kurtosis with radius. The range of kurtosis and skewness values is modeled by
small variations in the Mach number close to the sonic limit and by conversion
of HI to molecules at high column density. The maximum HI column densities
decrease with increasing radius in a way that suggests molecules are forming in
the weak field limit, where H_2 formation balances photodissociation in

model shows that the boundaries of language dialect regions are controlled by a
length minimizing effect analogous to surface tension, mediated by variations
in population density which can induce curvature, and by the shape of coastline
or similar borders. The predictability of dialect regions arises because these
effects will drive many complex, randomized early states toward one of a
smaller number of stable final configurations. The model is able to reproduce
observations and predictions of dialectologists. These include dialect
continua, isogloss bundling, fanning, the wave-like spread of dialect features
from cities, and the impact of human movement on the number of dialects that an
area can support. The model also provides an analytical form for S\'{e}guy's

jargon that can be difficult for patients to comprehend. One way to help
patients is to reduce information overload and help them focus on medical terms
that matter most to them.
  Objective: The aim of this work was to develop FIT (Finding Important Terms
for patients), an unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) system that
ranks medical terms in EHR notes based on their importance to patients.
  Methods: We built FIT on a new unsupervised ensemble ranking model derived
from the biased random walk algorithm to combine heterogeneous information
resources for ranking candidate terms from each EHR note. Specifically, FIT
integrates four single views for term importance: patient use of medical
concepts, document-level term salience, word-occurrence based term relatedness,
and topic coherence. It also incorporates partial information of term
importance as conveyed by terms' unfamiliarity levels and semantic types. We
evaluated FIT on 90 expert-annotated EHR notes and compared it with three
benchmark unsupervised ensemble ranking methods.
  Results: FIT achieved 0.885 AUC-ROC for ranking candidate terms from EHR
notes to identify important terms. When including term identification, the
performance of FIT for identifying important terms from EHR notes was 0.813
AUC-ROC. It outperformed the three ensemble rankers for most metrics. Its
performance is relatively insensitive to its parameter.
  Conclusions: FIT can automatically identify EHR terms important to patients
and may help develop personalized interventions to improve quality of care. By
using unsupervised learning as well as a robust and flexible framework for
information fusion, FIT can be readily applied to other domains and
applications.

\cite{ atri1993single}. Omitting diffusion, the model is a system of two
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the calcium concentration,
and the fraction of $IP_3$ receptors that have not been inactivated by the
calcium. We analyse in detail the system as the $IP_3$ concentration, the
\textit{bifurcation parameter}, increases presenting some new insights. We
analyse asymptotically the relaxation oscillations of the model by exploiting a
separation of timescales. Furthermore, motivated by experimental evidence that
cells release calcium when mechanically stimulated and that, in turn, calcium
release affects the mechanical behaviour of cells, we propose an extension of
the Atri model to a 3D nonlinear ODE mechanochemical model, where the
additional equation, derived consistently from a full viscoelastic
\emph{ansatz}, models the evolution of cell/tissue dilatation. Furthermore, in
the calcium dynamics equation we introduce a new ""stretch-activation"" source
term that induces calcium release and which involves a new bifurcation
parameter, the ""strength"" of the source. Varying the two bifurcation
parameters, we analyse in detail the interplay of the mechanical and the
chemical effects, and we find that as the strength of the mechanical stimulus
is increased, the $IP_3$ parameter range for which oscillations emerge
decreases, until oscillations eventually vanish at a critical value. Finally,
we analyse the model when the calcium dynamics are assumed faster than the
dynamics of the other two variables.

its large energy density predicted by quantum field theory seriously and
assuming that it does gravitate to obey the equivalence principle of general

what people previously thought. The consequence of this difference is an
accelerating universe with a small Hubble expansion rate $H\propto \Lambda
e^{-\beta\sqrt{G}\Lambda}\to 0$ instead of the previous prediction
$H=\sqrt{8\pi G\rho^{vac}/3}\propto\sqrt{G}\Lambda^2\to\infty$ which was
unbounded, as the high energy cutoff $\Lambda$ is taken to infinity. In this
sense, at least the ""old"" cosmological constant problem would be resolved.
Moreover, it gives the observed slow rate of the accelerating expansion as
$\Lambda$ is taken to be some large value of the order of Planck energy or
higher. This result suggests that there is no necessity to introduce the
cosmological constant, which is required to be fine tuned to an accuracy of
$10^{-120}$, or other forms of dark energy, which are required to have peculiar
negative pressure, to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the

extensions of the monadic second order (MSO) logic on two classes of graphs:
graphs of bounded treewidth and graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity.
  A classical theorem of Courcelle states that any graph property definable in
MSO is decidable in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Algorithmic
metatheorems like Courcelle's serve to generalize known positive results on
various graph classes. We explore and extend three previously studied MSO
extensions: global and local cardinality constraints (CardMSO and MSO-LCC) and
optimizing the fair objective function (fairMSO).
  First, we show how these extensions of MSO relate to each other in their
expressive power. Furthermore, we highlight a certain ""linearity"" of some of
the newly introduced extensions which turns out to play an important role.
Second, we provide parameterized algorithm for the aforementioned structural
parameters. On the side of neighborhood diversity, we show that combining the
linear variants of local and global cardinality constraints is possible while
keeping the linear (FPT) runtime but removing linearity of either makes this
impossible. Moreover, we provide a polynomial time (XP) algorithm for the most
powerful of studied extensions, i.e. the combination of global and local
constraints. Furthermore, we show a polynomial time (XP) algorithm on graphs of
bounded treewidth for the same extension. In addition, we propose a general
procedure of deriving XP algorithms on graphs on bounded treewidth via
formulation as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). This shows an alternate
approach as compared to standard dynamic programming formulations.

back in time to identify how the dichotomy between fast and slow rotating
ellipticals (FRs and SRs) develops. Comparing to the
$\textrm{ATLAS}^\textrm{3D}$ survey, we show that Illustris reproduces similar
elliptical galaxy rotation properties, quantified by the degree of ordered
rotation, $\lambda_\textrm{R}$. There is a clear segregation between low-mass
($M_{\rm *} < 10^{11} M_{\rm \odot}$) ellipticals, which form a smooth
distribution of FRs, and high-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm *} > 10^{11.5} M_{\rm
  \odot}$), which are mostly SRs, in agreement with observations. We find that
SRs are very gas poor, metal rich and red in colour, while FRs are generally
more gas rich and still star forming. We suggest that ellipticals begin
naturally as FRs and, as they grow in mass, lose their spin and become SRs.
While at $z = 1$, the progenitors of SRs and FRs are nearly indistinguishable,
their merger and star formation histories differ thereafter. We find that major
mergers tend to disrupt galaxy spin, though in rare cases can lead to a
spin-up. No major difference is found between the effects of gas-rich and
gas-poor mergers and the amount of minor mergers seem to have little
correlation with galaxy spin. In between major mergers, lower-mass ellipticals,
which are mostly gas-rich, tend to recover their spin by accreting gas and
stars. For galaxies with $M_{\rm *}$ above $\sim 10^{11} M_{\rm \odot}$, this
trend reverses; galaxies only retain or steadily lose their spin. More frequent
mergers, accompanied by an inability to regain spin, lead massive ellipticals
to lose most of ordered rotation and transition from FRs to SRs.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine

open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular
featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open

representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly
offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable
representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity

over anti-matter in our Universe. In many model extensions this is a very
natural consequence of neutrinos being their own anti-particles (Majorana
particles) which implies that a lepton number violating radioactive decay named
neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay should exist. The detection
of this extremely rare hypothetical process requires utmost suppression of any
kind of backgrounds.
  The GERDA collaboration searches for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge
($^{76}\rm{Ge} \rightarrow\,^{76}\rm{Se} + 2e^-$) by operating bare detectors
made from germanium with enriched $^{76}$Ge fraction in liquid argon. Here, we
report on first data of GERDA Phase II. A background level of $\approx10^{-3}$
cts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) has been achieved which is the world-best if
weighted by the narrow energy-signal region of germanium detectors. Combining
Phase I and II data we find no signal and deduce a new lower limit for the
half-life of $5.3\cdot10^{25}$ yr at 90 % C.L. Our sensitivity of
$4.0\cdot10^{25}$ yr is competitive with the one of experiments with
significantly larger isotope mass.
  GERDA is the first $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiment that will be background-free
up to its design exposure. This progress relies on a novel active veto system,
the superior germanium detector energy resolution and the improved background
recognition of our new detectors. The unique discovery potential of an
essentially background-free search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay motivates a
larger germanium experiment with higher sensitivity.

However, the multiple reflections and refractions between the air/glass and
liquid/glass interfaces cannot be sufficiently eliminated by using the
reference system, and the induced measurement error increases significantly
with increasing difference in refractive index between two neighboring media at
these interfaces. In this paper, an improved transmission method is proposed to
measure the extinction coefficient of micro/nano particles. The extinction
coefficient of the particles is determined based on an optical model taking
into account the multiple reflection and refraction at the glass/liquid
interfaces. An experimental validation was conducted for suspensions with
various mean particle sizes. By considering the higher-order transmission
terms, the improved transmission method generally achieved high accuracy
improvement over the traditional transmission method for extinction coefficient
measurement, especially for the case with small optical thickness of particle

packing is governed by the effective interaction between them and the elastic
strain of bending the growing crystal. For example, if growth commences under
appropriate conditions, and the circular crystal that forms reaches a critical
size, growth continues by incorporation of defects to alleviate elastic strain.
Recently it was found experimentally that, if defect formation is somehow not
possible, the crystal instead continues growing in ribbons that protrude from
the original crystal. Here we report on computer simulations in which we
observe both the formation of ribbons at short interaction ranges and packings
that incorporate defects if the interaction is longer-ranged. The ribbons only
form above some critical crystal size, below which the nucleus is roughly
spherically shaped. We find that the scaling of the critical crystal size
differs slightly from the one proposed by the Manoharan group, and reason this
is because the actual process is a two-step heterogeneous nucleation of ribbons
on top of roughly circular crystals.

However, the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to
the following reasons, e.g. low contrast between lesions and skin, visual
similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable
automatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and
efficiency of pathologists. International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is
a challenge focusing on the automatic analysis of skin lesion. In this paper,
we proposed two deep learning methods to address all the three tasks announced
in ISIC 2017, i.e. lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature
extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning
framework consisting of two fully-convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is
proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse
classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to
refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map.
A straight-forward CNN is proposed for the dermoscopic feature extraction task.
To our best knowledges, we are not aware of any previous work proposed for this

to the small angular separation and high contrast between exoplanets and their
host stars. High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a pathway to achieve
unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. Here, we
present a framework to simulate HDC observations and data analyses. The goal of
these simulations is to perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between
raw star light suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument
configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the performance of
an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing directly imaged
gas-giant planets in near infrared bands. We also simulate HDC observations of
an Earth-like planet using next-generation ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base
telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We conclude that ground-based ELTs are more
suitable for HDC observations of an Earth-like planet than future space-based
missions owing to the considerable difference in collecting area. For
ground-based telescopes, HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in
the habitable zone around an M dwarf star at 10$^{-4}$ starlight suppression
level. Compared to the 10$^{-7}$ planet/star contrast, HDC relaxes the
starlight suppression requirement by a factor of 10$^3$. For space-based
telescopes, detector noise will be a major limitation at spectral resolutions
higher than 10$^4$. Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise,
R=400 (1600) is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx(LUVOIR). The
corresponding starlight suppression requirement to detect a planet with
planet/star contrast=$6.1\times10^{-11}$ is relaxed by a factor of 10 (100) for
HabEx (LUVOIR).

developed by Nozi\`eres and Schmitt-Rink, we evaluate this thermodynamic
quantity as a function of temperature, in the whole interaction regime. While
the uniaxial anisotropy is not crucial for $C_V$ in the weak-coupling regime,
$C_V$ is found to be sensitive to the uniaxial anisotropy in the
strong-coupling regime. This originates from the population imbalance among
$p_i$-wave molecules ($i=x,y,z$), indicating that the specific heat is a useful
observable to see which kinds of $p$-wave molecules dominantly exist in the
strong-coupling regime when the $p$-wave interaction has uniaxial anisotropy.
Using this strong point, we classify the strong-coupling regime into some
characteristic regions. Since a $p$-wave pairing interaction with uniaxial
anisotropy has been discovered in a $^{40}$K Fermi gas, our results would be
useful in considering strong-coupling properties of a $p$-wave interacting
Fermi gas, when the interaction is uniaxially anisotropic.

diagonalization problem (JBD) as a special case for which all $W^{T} A_i W$ are

practically applications such as multidimensional independent component
analysis (MICA) for which it does exist under the ideal situation, i.e., no

one can only make all $\widetilde{W}^{T} A_i\widetilde{W}$ nearly block
diagonal at best, where $\widetilde{W}$ is an approximation to $W$, obtained
usually by computation. This motivates us to develop a perturbation theory for
JBDP to address, among others, the question: how accurate this $\widetilde{W}$
is. Previously such a theory for JDP has been discussed, but no effort has been

space and has attracted considerable research interest recently. Yet how to
efficiently learn the SLM under full generality using nonconvex solver still
remains an open question due to several fundamental limitations of the
conventional gradient descent learning framework. In this study, we try to
attack this problem from a gradient-free approach which we call the
moment-estimation-sequence (MES) method. We show that the conventional gradient
descent heuristic is biased by the skewness of the distribution therefore is no
longer the best practice of learning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we
design a nonconvex alternating iteration process to train a $d$-dimension
rank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory and one-pass of the dataset. The proposed
method converges globally and linearly, achieves $\epsilon$ recovery error
after retrieving $O[k^{2}d\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\epsilon)]$ samples.
Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned
on every sub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a
so-called $\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\tau^{2})$
samples where $p$ and $\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness
and kurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition
diagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability
of the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the
sampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm.

alleviating the extreme price volatility levels due to their energy usage time

propose a stochastic bi-level optimization model to find the optimal nodal
storage capacities required to achieve a certain price volatility level in a

in the upper level problem and the operation of strategic/regulated generation,
storage and transmission players is modeled at the lower level problem using an
extended Cournot-based stochastic game. The South Australia (SA) electricity
market, which has recently experienced high levels of price volatility, is
considered as the case study for the proposed storage allocation framework. Our
numerical results indicate that 80% price volatility reduction in SA

are more efficient in reducing the price volatility than strategic storage
firms.

little is known about the evolutionary pathways of molecular cloud organics
from dense molecular clouds to planetary systems. In this study, we focus on
the evolution of the morphological and viscoelastic properties of molecular
cloud refractory organic matter. We found that the organic residue,
experimentally synthesized at about 10 K from UV-irradiated H2O-CH3OH-NH3 ice,
changed significantly in terms of its nanometer- to micrometer-scale morphology
and viscoelastic properties after UV irradiation at room temperature. The dose
of this irradiation was equivalent to that experienced after short residence in
diffuse clouds (equal or less than 10,000 years) or irradiation in outer
protoplanetary disks. The irradiated organic residues became highly porous and
more rigid and formed amorphous nanospherules. These nanospherules are
morphologically similar to organic nanoglobules observed in the least-altered
chondrites, chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles, and cometary
samples, suggesting that irradiation of refractory organics could be a possible
formation pathway for such nanoglobules. The storage modulus (elasticity) of
photo-irradiated organic residues is about 100 MPa irrespective of vibrational
frequency, a value that is lower than the storage moduli of minerals and ice.
Dust grains coated with such irradiated organics would therefore stick together
efficiently, but growth to larger grains might be suppressed due to an increase
in aggregate brittleness caused by the strong connections between grains.

  Denser",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As memory scales down to smaller technology nodes, new failure mechanisms
emerge that threaten its correct operation. If such failure mechanisms are not
anticipated and corrected, they can not only degrade system reliability and
availability but also, perhaps even more importantly, open up security
vulnerabilities: a malicious attacker can exploit the exposed failure mechanism
to take over the entire system. As such, new failure mechanisms in memory can
become practical and significant threats to system security.
  In this work, we discuss the RowHammer problem in DRAM, which is a prime (and
perhaps the first) example of how a circuit-level failure mechanism in DRAM can
cause a practical and widespread system security vulnerability. RowHammer, as
it is popularly referred to, is the phenomenon that repeatedly accessing a row
in a modern DRAM chip causes bit flips in physically-adjacent rows at
consistently predictable bit locations. It is caused by a hardware failure
mechanism called DRAM disturbance errors, which is a manifestation of
circuit-level cell-to-cell interference in a scaled memory technology. We
analyze the root causes of the RowHammer problem and examine various solutions.
We also discuss what other vulnerabilities may be lurking in DRAM and other
types of memories, e.g., NAND flash memory or Phase Change Memory, that can
potentially threaten the foundations of secure systems, as the memory
technologies scale to higher densities. We conclude by describing and
advocating a principled approach to memory reliability and security research
that can enable us to better anticipate and prevent such vulnerabilities.

signal and calculate the visibilities expected in radio-interferometric
observations with OWFA. In the first method we use an input model for the
expected 21-cm power spectrum to directly simulate different random
realizations of the brightness temperature fluctuations and calculate the
visibilities. This method, which models the HI signal entirely as a diffuse
radiation, is completely oblivious to the discrete nature of the astrophysical
sources which host the HI. While each discrete source subtends an angle that is
much smaller than the angular resolution of OWFA, the velocity structure of the
HI inside the individual sources is well within reach of OWFA's frequency
resolution and this is expected to have an impact on the observed HI signal.
The second prescription is based on cosmological N-body simulations. Here we
identify each simulation particle with a source that hosts the HI, and we have
the freedom to implement any desired line profile for the HI emission from the
individual sources. Implementing a simple model for the line profile, we have
generated several random realizations of the complex visibilities. Correlations
between the visibilities measured at different baselines and channels provides
an unique method to quantify the statistical properties of the \HI signal. We
have used this to quantify the results of our simulations, and explore the
relation between the expected visibility correlations and the underlying HI
power spectrum.

link between distribution of galaxies and the process of star formation.
Redshifted 21 cm radiation from the Hyperfine transition of neutral Hydrogen
allows us to probe the neutral component of cold gas, most of which is to be
found in the interstellar medium of galaxies. Existing and upcoming radio
telescopes can probe the large scale distribution of neutral Hydrogen via HI
intensity mapping. In this paper we use an estimate of the HI power spectrum
derived using an ansatz to compute the expected signal from the large scale HI
distribution at z ~ 3. We find that the scale dependence of bias at small
scales makes a significant difference to the expected signal even at large
angular scales. We compare the predicted signal strength with the sensitivity
of radio telescopes that can observe such radiation and calculate the
observation time required for detecting neutral Hydrogen at these redshifts. We
find that OWFA (Ooty Wide Field Array) offers the best possibility to detect
neutral Hydrogen at z ~ 3 before the SKA (Square Kilometer Array) becomes
operational. We find that the OWFA should be able to make a 3 sigma or a more
significant detection in 2000 hours of observations at several angular scales.
Calculations done using the Fisher matrix approach indicate that a 5 sigma
detection of the binned HI power spectrum via measurement of the amplitude of
the HI power spectrum is possible in 1000 hours (Sarkar, Bharadwaj and Ali,

  with Logarithmic Regret",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) mechanisms are widely used in sponsored
search auctions, crowdsourcing, online procurement, etc. Existing stochastic
MAB mechanisms with a deterministic payment rule, proposed in the literature,
necessarily suffer a regret of $\Omega(T^{2/3})$, where $T$ is the number of
time steps. This happens because the existing mechanisms consider the worst
case scenario where the means of the agents' stochastic rewards are separated
by a very small amount that depends on $T$. We make, and, exploit the crucial
observation that in most scenarios, the separation between the agents' rewards
is rarely a function of $T$. Moreover, in the case that the rewards of the arms
are arbitrarily close, the regret contributed by such sub-optimal arms is
minimal. Our idea is to allow the center to indicate the resolution, $\Delta$,
with which the agents must be distinguished. This immediately leads us to
introduce the notion of $\Delta$-Regret. Using sponsored search auctions as a
concrete example (the same idea applies for other applications as well), we
propose a dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and individually
rational (IR), deterministic MAB mechanism, based on ideas from the Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) family of MAB algorithms. Remarkably, the proposed
mechanism $\Delta$-UCB achieves a $\Delta$-regret of $O(\log T)$ for the case
of sponsored search auctions. We first establish the results for single slot

  Memory","under review in Transactions on Image Processing",,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile streaming video data accounts for a large and increasing percentage of
wireless network traffic. The available bandwidths of modern wireless networks
are often unstable, leading to difficulties in delivering smooth, high-quality
video. Streaming service providers such as Netflix and YouTube attempt to adapt
their systems to adjust in response to these bandwidth limitations by changing
the video bitrate or, failing that, allowing playback interruptions
(rebuffering). Being able to predict end user' quality of experience (QoE)
resulting from these adjustments could lead to perceptually-driven network
resource allocation strategies that would deliver streaming content of higher
quality to clients, while being cost effective for providers. Existing
objective QoE models only consider the effects on user QoE of video quality
changes or playback interruptions. For streaming applications, adaptive network
strategies may involve a combination of dynamic bitrate allocation along with
playback interruptions when the available bandwidth reaches a very low value.
Towards effectively predicting user QoE, we propose Video Assessment of
TemporaL Artifacts and Stalls (Video ATLAS): a machine learning framework where
we combine a number of QoE-related features, including objective quality
features, rebuffering-aware features and memory-driven features to make QoE
predictions. We evaluated our learning-based QoE prediction model on the
recently designed LIVE-Netflix Video QoE Database which consists of practical
playout patterns, where the videos are afflicted by both quality changes and
rebuffering events, and found that it provides improved performance over
state-of-the-art video quality metrics while generalizing well on different
datasets. The proposed algorithm is made publicly available at

  Suppose one is in coordinates such that the surface is localized near some

surface is represented as the graph of $z_0 + s(x - x_0, y - y_0)$ near

maximal averaging operator is bounded on $L^p$ for $p > \max(2,1/g)$, where $g$

Let ${\beta}^{(1)},\ldots,{\beta}^{(L)}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ be $ L $ unknown sparse
parameter vectors with a total of $ K $ non-zero coefficients. Noisy linear
measurements are obtained in the form $y_i={x}_i^H {\beta}^{(\ell_i)} + w_i$,
each of which is generated randomly from one of the sparse vectors with the
label $ \ell_i $ unknown. The goal is to estimate the parameter vectors
efficiently with low sample and computational costs. This problem presents
significant challenges as one needs to simultaneously solve the demixing
problem of recovering the labels $ \ell_i $ as well as the estimation problem
of recovering the sparse vectors $ {\beta}^{(\ell)} $.
  Our solution to the problem leverages the connection between modern coding
theory and statistical inference. We introduce a new algorithm, Mixed-Coloring,
which samples the mixture strategically using query vectors $ {x}_i $
constructed based on ideas from sparse graph codes. Our novel code design
allows for both efficient demixing and parameter estimation. In the noiseless
setting, for a constant number of sparse parameter vectors, our algorithm
achieves the order-optimal sample and time complexities of $\Theta(K)$. In the
presence of Gaussian noise, for the problem with two parameter vectors (i.e.,
$L=2$), we show that the Robust Mixed-Coloring algorithm achieves near-optimal
$\Theta(K polylog(n))$ sample and time complexities. When $K=O(n^{\alpha})$ for
some constant $\alpha\in(0,1)$ (i.e., $K$ is sublinear in $n$), we can achieve
sample and time complexities both sublinear in the ambient dimension. In one of
our experiments, to recover a mixture of two regressions with dimension $n=500$
and sparsity $K=50$, our algorithm is more than $300$ times faster than EM
algorithm, with about one third of its sample cost.

are then computed from the foregrounds. These visibilities are then used for
further processing, such as calibration and power spectrum estimation. The
package allows for rich visualisation features in multiple output formats in an

dynamical dark energy models using cosmological observations and summarize the
findings. (i) In dynamical dark energy models, compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the
upper limit of $\sum m_\nu$ can become larger and can also become smaller. In
the cases of phantom and early phantom (i.e., the quintom evolving from $w<-1$
to $w>-1$), the constraint on $\sum m_\nu$ becomes looser; but in the cases of
quintessence and early quintessence (i.e., the quintom evolving from $w>-1$ to
$w<-1$), the constraint on $\sum m_\nu$ becomes tighter. (ii) In the
holographic dark energy (HDE) model, the tightest constraint on $\sum m_\nu$,
i.e., $\sum m_\nu<0.105$ eV, is obtained, which is almost equal to the lower
limit of $\sum m_\nu$ of IH case. Thus, it is of great interest to find that
the future neutrino oscillation experiments would potentially offer a possible
falsifying scheme for the HDE model. (iii) The mass splitting of neutrinos can
influence the cosmological fits. We find that the NH case fits the current
observations slightly better than the IH case, although the difference of
$\chi^2$ of the two cases is still not significant enough to definitely

quantum communication and computation, comparing to its classical counterpart.
The essence of quantum processing lies on the fundamental difference between
classical and quantum states. For a physical system, the coherent superposition
on a computational basis is different from the statistical mixture of states in
the same basis. Such coherent superposition endows the possibility of
generating true random numbers, realizing parallel computing, and other
classically impossible tasks such as quantum Bernoulli factory. Considering a
system that consists of multiple parts, the coherent superposition that exists
nonlocally on different systems is called entanglement. By properly
manipulating entanglement, it is possible to realize computation and simulation
tasks that are intractable with classical means. Investigating quantumness,
coherent superposition, and entanglement can shed light on the original of
quantum advantages and lead to the design of new quantum protocols.
  This thesis mainly focuses on the interplay between quantumness and two
information tasks, randomness generation and selftesting quantum information
processing. We discuss how quantumness can be used to generate randomness and
show that randomness can in turn be used to quantify quantumness. In addition,
we introduce the Bernoulli factory problem and present the quantum advantage
with only coherence in both theory and experiment. Furthermore, we show a
method to witness entanglement that is independent of the realization of the
measurement. We also investigate randomness requirements in selftesting tasks
and propose a random number generation scheme that is independent of the
randomness source.

Nuclei (AGN) identified in the 7Ms Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) survey over

plus reflection, with possible soft excess and narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line, we
perform a systematic X-ray spectral analysis, both on the total 7Ms exposure
and in four different periods with lengths of 2-21 months. With this approach,
we not only present the power-law slopes, column densities $N_H$, observed
fluxes, and absorption-corrected 2-10~keV luminosities $L_X$ for our sample of
AGNs, but also identify significant spectral variabilities among them on time
scales of years. We find that the $N_H$ variabilities can be ascribed to two
different types of mechanisms, either flux-driven or flux-independent. We also
find that the correlation between the narrow Fe line EW and $N_H$ can be well
explained by the continuum suppression with increasing $N_H$. Accounting for
the sample incompleteness and bias, we measure the intrinsic distribution of
$N_H$ for the CDF-S AGN population and present re-selected subsamples which are
complete with respect to $N_H$. The $N_H$-complete subsamples enable us to
decouple the dependences of $N_H$ on $L_X$ and on redshift. Combining our data
with that from C-COSMOS, we confirm the anti-correlation between the average
$N_H$ and $L_X$ of AGN, and find a significant increase of the AGN obscured
fraction with redshift at any luminosity. The obscured fraction can be
described as $f_{obscured}\thickapprox 0.42\ (1+z)^{0.60}$.

are free from basic communication errors. Recent work has shown that
asynchronous session subtyping is undecidable. However, since session types
have become popular in mainstream programming languages in which asynchronous
communication is the norm rather than the exception, it is crucial to detect
significant decidable subtyping relations. Previous work considered extremely
restrictive fragments in which limitations were imposed to the size of
communication buffer (at most 1) or to the possibility to express multiple
choices (disallowing them completely in one of the compared types). In this
work, for the first time, we show decidability of a fragment that does not
impose any limitation on communication buffers and allows both the compared
types to include multiple choices for either input or output, thus yielding a
fragment which is more significant from an applicability viewpoint. In general,
we study the boundary between decidability and undecidability by considering
several fragments of subtyping. Notably, we show that subtyping remains
undecidable even if restricted to not using output covariance and input
contravariance.

  Series",,"10.1088/1742-6596/840/1/012025",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the latest results of numerical simulations following the orbital
decay of massive black hole pairs in galaxy mergers. We highlight important
differences between gas-poor and gas-rich hosts, and between orbital evolution
taking place at high redshift as opposed to low redshift. Two effects have a
huge impact and are rather novel in the context of massive black hole binaries.
The first is the increase in characteristic density of galactic nuclei of
merger remnants as galaxies are more compact at high redshift due to the way
dark halo collapse depends on redshift. This leads naturally to hardening
timescales due to 3-body encounters that should decrease by two orders of
magnitude up to $z=4$. It explains naturally the short binary coalescence
timescale, $\sim 10$ Myr, found in novel cosmological simulations that follow
binary evolution from galactic to milliparsec scales. The second one is the
inhomogeneity of the interstellar medium in massive gas-rich disks at high
redshift. In the latter star forming clumps 1-2 orders of magnitude more
massive than local Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) can scatter massive black
holes out of the disk plane via gravitational perturbations and direct
encounters. This renders the character of orbital decay inherently stochastic,
often increasing orbital decay timescales by as much as a Gyr. At low redshift
a similar regime is present at scales of $1-10$ pc inside Circumnuclear Gas
Disks (CNDs). In CNDs only massive black holes with masses below $10^7
M_{\odot}$ can be significantly perturbed. They decay to sub-pc separations in
up to $\sim 10^8$ yr rather than the in just a few million years as in a smooth
CND. Finally implications for building robust forecasts of LISA event rates are
discussed

point located above the supergranular cell. The potential field extrapolation
of the photospheric magnetic field indicates that the circular chromospheric
ribbon is cospatial with the fan footpoints, while the ribbons of the inner and
outer spines look like compact kernels. We found new interesting observational
aspects that need to be explained by models: 1) a loop corresponding to the
outer spine became brighter a few minutes before the onset of the flare; 2) the
circular ribbon was formed by several adjacent compact kernels characterized by
a size of 1""-2""; 3) the kernels with stronger intensity emission were located
at the outer footpoint of the darker filaments departing radially from the
center of the supergranular cell; 4) these kernels start to brighten
sequentially in clockwise direction; 5) the site of the 3D null point and the
shape of the outer spine were detected by RHESSI in the low energy channel
between 6.0 and 12.0 keV. Taking into account all these features and the length
scales of the magnetic systems involved by the event we argued that the low

two-dimensional (2D) devices are often limited by the large resistance offered
by the metal contact interface. Till date, the carrier injection mechanism from
metal to 2D TMDC layers remains unclear, with widely varying reports of
Schottky barrier height (SBH) and contact resistance (Rc), particularly in the
monolayer limit. In this work, we use a combination of theory and experiments
in Au and Ni contacted monolayer MoS2 device to conclude the following points:
(i) the carriers are injected at the source contact through a cascade of two
potential barriers - the barrier heights being determined by the degree of
interaction between the metal and the TMDC layer; (ii) the conventional
Richardson equation becomes invalid due to the multi-dimensional nature of the
injection barriers, and using Bardeen-Tersoff theory, we derive the appropriate
form of the Richardson equation that describes such composite barrier; (iii) we
propose a novel transfer length method (TLM) based SBH extraction methodology,
to reliably extract SBH by eliminating any confounding effect of temperature
dependent channel resistance variation; (iv) we derive the Landauer limit of
the contact resistance achievable in such devices. A comparison of the limits
with the experimentally achieved contact resistance reveals plenty of room for
technological improvements.

resource may become unavailable to the other side of the market, at least for a
while. This is especially an issue in online platforms involving human experts
as the expert resources are often scarce. The efficient utilization of experts
in these platforms is made challenging by the fact that the information
available about the parties involved is usually limited.
  To address this challenge, we develop a model of a task-expert matching
system where a task is matched to an expert using not only the prior
information about the task but also the feedback obtained from the past
matches. In our model the tasks arrive online while the experts are fixed and
constrained by a finite service capacity. For this model, we characterize the
maximum task resolution throughput a platform can achieve. We show that the
natural greedy approaches where each expert is assigned a task most suitable to
her skill is suboptimal, as it does not internalize the above externality. We
develop a throughput optimal backpressure algorithm which does so by accounting
for the `congestion' among different task types. Finally, we validate our model
and confirm our theoretical findings with data-driven simulations via logs of
Math.StackExchange, a StackOverflow forum dedicated to mathematics.

balance, but is subject to a time-periodic external field. It states that the

This makes an analogy between features of steady periodic and equilibrium
states, because in the latter situation all probability currents vanish
explicitly. However, the assumption on the Arrhenius rates is fairly specific,
and it need not be met in applications. Here a new mechanism is identified for
the no-pumping theorem, which holds for symmetric time-periodic external fields
and the so called destination rates. These rates are the ones that lead to the
locally equilibrium form of the master equation, where dissipative effects are
proportional to the difference between the actual probability and the
equilibrium (Gibbsian) one. The mechanism also leads to an approximate
no-pumping theorem for the Fokker-Planck rates that relate to the

sufficient to explain the full complexity of the H.E.S.S. $\gamma$-ray light

finite graphs of bounded structural complexity. It is a major open problem
whether parity games with perfect information can be solved in PTIME.
Restricting the structural complexity of the game arenas, however, often leads
to efficient algorithms for parity games. Such results are known for graph
classes of bounded tree-width, DAG-width, directed path-width, and
entanglement, which we describe in terms of cops and robber games. Conversely,
the introduction of imperfect information makes the problem more difficult, it
becomes EXPTIME-hard. We analyse the interaction of both approaches.
  We use a simple method to measure the amount of ""unawareness""' of a player,
the amount of imperfect information. It turns out that if it is unbounded, low
structural complexity does not make the problem simpler. It remains
EXPTIME-hard or PSPACE-hard even on very simple graphs.
  For games with bounded imperfect information we analyse the powerset
construction, which is commonly used to convert a game of imperfect information
into an equivalent game with perfect information. This construction preserves
boundedness of directed path-width and DAG-width, but not of entanglement or of
tree-width. Hence, if directed path-width or DAG-width are bounded, parity
games with bounded imperfect information can be solved in PTIME. For DAG-width
we follow two approaches. One leads to a generalization of the known fact that
perfect information parity games are in PTIME if DAG-width is bounded. We prove
this theorem for non-monotone DAG-width. The other approach introduces a cops
and robbers game (with multiple robbers) on directed graphs, considered
Richerby and Thilikos forundirected graphs. We show a tight linear bound for
the number of additional cops needed to capture an additional robber.

For scenarios where it is not possible to use precise construction, we propose
a method for an estimation of the 3-D bounding box. The 3-D bounding box is
used to normalize the image viewpoint by ""unpacking"" the image into a plane. We
also propose to randomly alter the color of the image and add a rectangle with

misalignment of detectors result in $O(1)$ errors of the albedo operator and
hence in $O(1)$ error predictions on the reconstruction of the coefficients,
which are not useful. This paper revisit such stability estimates by
introducing a more forgiving metric on the measurements errors, namely the
$1-$Wasserstein distances, which penalize blurring or misalignment by an amount
proportional to the width of the blurring kernel or to the amount of
misalignment. We obtain new stability estimates in this setting. We also
consider the effect of errors, still measured in the $1-$Wasserstein distance,

applying 3D reconstruction techniques (GCS, total mass) to stereoscopic

the CME in interplanetary space and derive its geometry and 3D-mass. We combine
the GCS and Lundquist model results to derive the axial flux and helicity of
the MC from in-situ measurements (Wind). This is compared to nonlinear
force-free (NLFF) model results as well as to the reconnected magnetic flux
derived from the flare ribbons (flare reconnection flux) and the magnetic flux
encompassed by the associated dimming (dimming flux). We find that magnetic
reconnection processes were already ongoing before the start of the impulsive
flare phase, adding magnetic flux to the flux rope before its final eruption.
The dimming flux increases by more than 25% after the end of the flare,
indicating that magnetic flux is still added to the flux rope after eruption.
Hence, the derived flare reconnection flux is most probably a lower limit for
estimating the magnetic flux within the flux rope. We find that the magnetic
helicity and axial magnetic flux are reduced in interplanetary space by ~50%
and 75%, respectively, possibly indicating to an erosion process. A mass
increase of 10% for the CME is observed over the distance range from ~4-20 Rs.
The temporal evolution of the CME associated core dimming regions supports the
scenario that fast outflows might supply additional mass to the rear part of
the CME.

multi-user MIMO systems with integrated services. Specifically, two sorts of
service messages are combined and served simultaneously: one multicast message
intended for all receivers and one confidential message intended for only one
receiver and required to be perfectly secure from other unauthorized receivers.
Our interest lies in the joint design of input covariances of the multicast
message, confidential message and artificial noise (AN), such that the
achievable secrecy rate and multicast rate are simultaneously maximized. This
problem is identified as a secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem in
the context of physical-layer service integration. Since this bi-objective
optimization problem is inherently complex to solve, we put forward two
different scalarization methods to convert it into a scalar optimization
problem. First, we propose to prefix the multicast rate as a constant, and
accordingly, the primal biobjective problem is converted into a secrecy rate
maximization (SRM) problem with quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraint.
By varying the constant, we can obtain different Pareto optimal points. The
resulting SRM problem can be iteratively solved via a provably convergent
difference-of-concave (DC) algorithm. In the second method, we aim to maximize
the weighted sum of the secrecy rate and the multicast rate. Through varying
the weighted vector, one can also obtain different Pareto optimal points. We
show that this weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) problem can be recast into
a primal decomposable form, which is amenable to alternating optimization (AO).
Then we compare these two scalarization methods in terms of their overall
performance and computational complexity via theoretical analysis as well as
numerical simulation, based on which new insights can be drawn.

Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based
synaptic interactions. The AdEx model can capture the spiking response of
different cell types, such as regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and
fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism,
together with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx
neurons. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated
networks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the
network, which is well predicted by the mean-field model. Second, we
investigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and
show that the mean-field model accurately predicts the response time course of
the population. One notable exception was that the ""tail"" of the response at
long times was not well predicted, because the mean-field does not include
adaptation mechanisms. We conclude that the Master Equation formalism can yield
mean-field models that predict well the behavior of nonlinear networks with
conductance-based interactions and various electrophysiolgical properties, and
should be a good candidate to model VSDi signals where both excitatory and

are conserved in the perfect-conductivity limit, as is the mass per unit axial

while constrained to remain approximately force-free. Interest centres on
whether the relaxed field may attain a Taylor state; but under the assumed
conditions with axial and toroidal flux conserved inside every cylindrical
Lagrangian surface, this is not possible. The effect of an additional
$\alpha$-effect associated with instabilities and turbulence in the plasma is
therefore investigated in exploratory manner. An assumed pseudo-scalar form of
$\alpha$ proportional to $q\,\eta\, ({\bf j}\cdot {\bf B})$ is adopted, where $
{\bf j}=\nabla\times {\bf B}$ and $q$ is an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ dimensionless

evolution remains smooth and similar to that for $q=0$; but that if $q>q_c$,
negative-diffusivity effects act on the axial component of $\bf B$, generating
high-frequency rapidly damped oscillations and an associated transitory
appearance of reversed axial field. However, the scalar quantity $\gamma={\bf

the following two power allocation problems: 1) minimizing distortion under

mean-squared error of the BLUE. Two iterative algorithms are developed to solve
the non-convex problems, which converge at least to a local optimum. In
particular, the above algorithms are designed to jointly optimize the

The model belongs to the class of flat-band systems and it has a rich
ground-state phase diagram including phases with spontaneously broken
translational symmetry. Moreover, it exhibits an anomalous low-temperature
thermodynamics close to continuous or discontinuous field-driven quantum phase
transitions between three quantum ferrimagnetic phases, tetramer-hexamer phase,

respect to that of continuum: the equivalent widths (EW) of the BAL decreases
(increases) when the continuum brightens (dims) as group T1; and the variation
of EW and continuum in the opposite relation as group T2. We find that T2 has
significantly (P_T<10-6 , Students T Test) higher EW ratios (R) of Si iv to C
iv BAL than T1. Our result agrees with the prediction of photoionization models
that C +3 column density increases (decreases) if there is a (or no) C +3
ionization front while R decreases with the incident continuum. We show that
BAL variabilities in at least 80% quasars are driven by the variation of
ionizing continuum while other models that predict uncorrelated BAL and

in the continuum flux calibration, the latter fraction may be much smaller.
When the sample is binned into different time interval between the two

composition determinations is challenging in massive star spectroscopy. On one
hand, the target selection for an unbiased sample build-up is complicated by
several types of peculiarities that can occur in individual objects. On the
other hand, composite spectra are often not recognized as such even at
medium-high spectral resolution and typical signal-to-noise ratios, despite
multiplicity among massive stars is widespread. In particular, surveys that
produce large amounts of automatically reduced data are prone to oversight of
details that turn hazardous for the analysis with techniques that have been
developed for a set of standard assumptions applicable to a spectrum of a
single star. Much larger systematic errors than anticipated may therefore
result because of the unrecognized true nature of the investigated objects, or
much smaller sample sizes of objects for the analysis than initially planned,
if recognized. More factors to be taken care of are the multiple steps from the
choice of instrument over the details of the data reduction chain to the choice
of modelling code, input data, analysis technique and the selection of the
spectral lines to be analyzed. Only when avoiding all the possible pitfalls, a
precise and accurate characterization of the stars in terms of fundamental
parameters and chemical fingerprints can be achieved that form the basis for
further investigations regarding e.g. stellar structure and evolution or the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The scope of the present work is to provide
the broader community with criteria to evaluate spectroscopic investigations of
massive stars before interpreting them in a broader context. The discussion is
guided by our experiences made over a decade of studies of massive star
spectroscopy ranging from the simplest single objects to multiple systems.

formalism of strictly correlated electrons in the adiabatic approximation. We
find that the first two leading terms in this series, corresponding to the
strictly correlated limit and its zero-point vibration correction, coincide
with the two leading terms of the exact expansion. We finally analyze the
spatial non-locality of these terms and show when the adiabatic approximation
breaks down. The ability to reproduce the exact kernel in the strong

theoretically explored by placing two-level dipole emitters at the narrow gaps
encountered in canonical plasmonic architectures, namely dimers and trimers of
different metallic nanoparticles. Through detailed simulations, in comparison
with appropriate analytical modelling, it is shown that within classical
electrodynamics, and for the reduced separations explored here, fluorescence
enhancement factors of the order of $10^{5}$ can be achieved, with a divergent
behaviour as the particle touching regime is approached. This remarkable
prediction is mainly governed by the dramatic increase in excitation rate
triggered by the corresponding field enhancement inside the gaps. Nevertheless,
once nonclassical corrections are included, the amplification factors decrease
by up to two orders of magnitude and a saturation regime for narrower gaps is
reached. These nonclassical limitations are demonstrated by simulations based
on the generalised nonlocal optical response theory, which accounts in an
efficient way not only for nonlocal screening, but also for the enhanced Landau
damping near the metal surface. A simple strategy to introduce nonlocal
corrections to the analytic solutions is also proposed. It is therefore shown
that the nonlocal optical response of the metal imposes more realistic, finite
upper bounds to the enhancement feasible with ultrasmall plasmonic cavities,
thus providing a theoretical description closer to state of the art
experiments.

Embarrassingly parallel inference would remove the communication needed, by
using completely independent computations on different data subsets, but it
suffers from the inherent unidentifiability of BMF solutions. We introduce a
hierarchical decomposition of the joint posterior distribution, which couples
the subset inferences, allowing for embarrassingly parallel computations in a
sequence of at most three stages. Using an efficient approximate
implementation, we show improvements empirically on both real and simulated

have been able to measure magnetic fields with typical error bars from 0.2 to
1.0 kG, depending on the apparent magnitude and on weather conditions. No
magnetic field has been firmly detected in any of our measurements, but we have
been able to estimate upper limits to the field values of our target stars. One
of our targets, 2dFS 936, exhibited an unexpected strengthening of emission
lines. We confirm the unusual behaviour of BI 57, which exhibits a 787 d period
with two photometric peaks and one spectroscopic maximum. The observed
strengthening of the emission lines of 2dFS 936, and the lack of detection of a
strong magnetic field in a star with such strong emission lines is at odd with
expectations. Together with the unusual periodic behaviour of BI 57, it
represents a challenge for the current models of Of?p stars. The limited
precision that we obtained in our field measurements (in most cases as a
consequence of poor weather) has led to field-strength upper limits that are
substantially larger than those typically measured in Galactic magnetic O
stars. Further higher precision observations and monitoring are clearly
required.

R_MAX, which varies in a range of (0.5-5)x10^20 Mx hour^-1 for active regions
with the maximal total unsigned flux of (0.5-3)x10^22 Mx. The normalized flux
growth rate, R_N, was defined under an assumption that the saturated total
unsigned flux, F_MAX, equals unity. Out of 42 ARs in our initial list, 36 event

events): the ARs with a short (<13 hours) interval dt_2 and a high (>0.024

characterized by a long (>13 hours) interval dt_2 and a low R_N (<0.024

according to several physical mechanisms that are active in clusters. Their
efficiency can strongly depend on the orbital configuration of the galaxies.
Our aim is to analyse the orbits of the galaxies in the cluster Abell 85, based
on the study of the galaxy velocity anisotropy parameter. We have solved the
Jeans equation under the assumption that the galaxies in A85 are collisionless
objects, within the spherically symmetric gravitational potential of the
virialized cluster. The mass of the cluster was estimated with X-ray and
caustic analyses. We find that the anisotropy profile of the full galaxy
population in A85 is an increasing monotonic function of the distance from the
cluster centre: on average, galaxies in the central region (r/r200 < 0.3) are
on isotropic orbits, while galaxies in the outer regions are on radial orbits.
We also find that the orbital properties of the galaxies strongly depend on
their stellar colour. In particular, blue galaxies are on less radial orbits
than red galaxies. The different families of cluster galaxies considered here
have the pseudo phase-space density profiles Q(r) and Qr(r) consistent with the
profiles expected in virialized dark matter halos in $N$-body simulations. This
result suggests that the galaxies in A85 have reached dynamical equilibrium
within the cluster potential. Our results indicate that the origin of the blue
and red colour of the different galaxy populations is the different orbital
shape rather than the accretion time.

response to changes in growth conditions induced e.g. by nutritional stress or
antibiotics. Part of the re-allocation accounts for the fact that, as the
growth rate is limited by targeting specific metabolic activities, cells simply
respond by fine-tuning their proteome to invest more resources into the
limiting activity (i.e. by synthesizing more proteins devoted to it). However,
this is often accompanied by an overall re-organization of metabolism, aimed at
improving the growth yield under limitation by re-wiring resource through
different pathways. While both effects impact proteome composition, the latter
underlies a more complex systemic response to stress. By focusing on E. coli's
`acetate switch', we use mathematical modeling and a re-analysis of empirical
data to show that the transition from a predominantly fermentative to a
predominantly respirative metabolism in carbon-limited growth results from the
trade-off between maximizing the growth yield and minimizing its costs in terms
of required the proteome share. In particular, E. coli's metabolic phenotypes
appear to be Pareto-optimal for these objective functions over a broad range of

because of its uniquely rich polymorphism and predicted but yet unconfirmed
features. Introducing a novel space of generalized coordinates that capture
changes in the topology of the interatomic network, we are able to
systematically track transitions among liquid, amorphous and crystalline forms
throughout the whole phase diagram of water, including the nucleation of
crystals above and below the melting point. Our approach, based on molecular
dynamics and enhanced sampling / free energy calculation techniques, is not
specific to water and could be applied to very different structural phase
transitions, paving the way towards the prediction of kinetic routes connecting
polymorphic structures in a range of materials.

semi-dense photometric and dense geometric error for the pose tracking (see

software verification tools with respect to their effectivity and efficiency.
Typically, the outcome of a competition is a (possibly category-specific)
ranking of the tools. For many applications, such as building portfolio
solvers, it would be desirable to have an idea of the (relative) performance of
verification tools on a given verification task beforehand, i.e., prior to
actually running all tools on the task.
  In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to predicting rankings
of tools on verification tasks. The method builds upon so-called label ranking
algorithms, which we complement with appropriate kernels providing a similarity
measure for verification tasks. Our kernels employ a graph representation for
software source code that mixes elements of control flow and program dependence
graphs with abstract syntax trees. Using data sets from SV-COMP, we demonstrate
our rank prediction technique to generalize well and achieve a rather high
predictive accuracy. In particular, our method outperforms a recently proposed
feature-based approach of Demyanova et al. (when applied to rank predictions).

is the real-time monitoring of public transport systems. One example is
determining the true (as opposed to the published) timetable of a public
transport system in real-time. In most cases, there are no other
publicly-available sources for this information. Yet, it is indispensable for
the real-time monitoring of public transport service levels. Furthermore, this
information, if accurate and temporally fine-grained, can be used for very
low-latency incident detection. In this work, we propose using spectral
clustering based on trajectories derived from passive WiFi traces of users of a
public transport system to infer the true timetable and two key performance
indicators of the transport service, namely public transport vehicle headway
and in-station dwell time. By detecting anomalous dwell times or headways, we
demonstrate that a fast and accurate real-time incident-detection procedure can
be obtained. The method we introduce makes use of the advantages of the
high-frequency WiFi data, which provides very low-latency,
universally-accessible information, while minimizing the impact of the noise in
the data.

mechanism samples a set of sequences whose distance to the input sequence is
approximately within specified bounds. This mechanism is implemented as an
extension of belief propagation, and uses local fields to bias the generation.
We show experimentally that sampled sequences are indeed closely correlated to
the standard musical similarity measure defined by Mongeau and Sankoff. We then
show how this mechanism can used to implement composition strategies that

gives insights both on its assembly process and subsequent evolution, and on
the stellar nucleogenesis of the different elements. Gradients can be traced
using several types of objects as, for instance, (young and old) stars, open
clusters, HII regions, planetary nebulae. We aim at tracing the radial
distributions of abundances of elements produced through different
nucleosynthetic channels -the alpha-elements O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti, and the
iron-peak elements Fe, Cr, Ni and Sc - by using the Gaia-ESO idr4 results of
open clusters and young field stars. From the UVES spectra of member stars, we
determine the average composition of clusters with ages >0.1 Gyr. We derive
statistical ages and distances of field stars. We trace the abundance gradients
using the cluster and field populations and we compare them with a
chemo-dynamical Galactic evolutionary model. Results. The adopted
chemo-dynamical model, with the new generation of metallicity-dependent stellar
yields for massive stars, is able to reproduce the observed spatial
distributions of abundance ratios, in particular the abundance ratios of [O/Fe]
and [Mg/Fe] in the inner disc (5 kpc<RGC <7 kpc), with their differences, that
were usually poorly explained by chemical evolution models. Often, oxygen and
magnesium are considered as equivalent in tracing alpha-element abundances and
in deducing, e.g., the formation time-scales of different Galactic stellar
populations. In addition, often [alpha/Fe] is computed combining several
alpha-elements. Our results indicate, as expected, a complex and diverse
nucleosynthesis of the various alpha-elements, in particular in the high
metallicity regimes, pointing towards a different origin of these elements and
highlighting the risk of considering them as a single class with common
features.

work (PRE, 94, 050603 (2016)), the transfer operator method is used, but here
we impose a restricted orientation and position approximation to yield an
analytic description of the physical properties. This allows us to study the
parallel fluid-like to zigzag solid-like structural transition, where the
compressibility and heat capacity peaks sharpen and get higher as $H

the resonance shift of the cavity mode, can be used as a diagnostic tool for
the position correlations of the atoms and hence the atomic quantum many-body

we show that classical changes induced in the binding site of the enzyme
spreads the quantum correlations among all of the four hydrogen-bonded atoms

to its initial state after the binding stage, the substrate ends in a new
transition state corresponding to a quantum superposition. Open quantum system
dynamics can then naturally drive the reaction in the forward direction from
the major tautomeric form to the minor tautomeric form without needing any
additional catalytic activity. We find that in this scenario the enzyme lowers
the activation energy so much that there is no energy barrier left in the
tautomerization, even if the quantum correlations quickly decay.

structured problems such as image, video, or voice, where vertices are

  Recently, researchers have proposed variations of CNNs that can handle graph

and our automated system were asked to measure MLS and MLS/ICWMAX in the same
sets of axial CT images obtained from 41 patients admitted to ICU under
neurosurgical service. A weighted midline (WML) was plotted based on individual
pixel intensities, with higher weighted given to the darker portions. The MLS
could then be measured as the distance between the WML and ideal midline (IML)
near the foramen of Monro. The average processing time to output an automatic
MLS measurement was around 10 seconds. Our automated system achieved an overall
accuracy of 90.24% when the CT images were calibrated automatically, and
performed better when the calibrations of head rotation were done manually

in this field. In fact, realistic interpretations need detailed investigations

goal of this paper is to determine new relationships which allow the
calculation of any collisional rates of the d-levels of ions by simply
determining the value of n^* and $E_p$ without the need of determining the
interaction potentials and treating the dynamics of collisions. The
determination of n^* and E_p is easy and based on atomic data usually available
online. Accurate collisional rates allow a reliable diagnostics of solar
magnetic fields. In this work we applied our collisional FORTRAN code to a
large number of cases involving complex and simple ions. After that, the
results are utilized and injected in a genetic programming code developed with
C-langugae in order to infer original relationships which will be of great help
to solar applications. We discussed the accurarcy of our collisional rates in
the cases of polarized complex atoms and atoms with hyperfine structure. The
relationships are expressed on the tensorial basis and we explain how to
include their contributions in the master equation giving the variation of the

ways: (i) The message is always inferred, but with an associated (minimum)
error; (ii) the message is inferred without error, but only sometimes; in case
of failure, nothing else is done. Here, we generalize on these approaches and
propose novel optimal probabilistic decoding schemes. The first uses
quantum-state separation to increase the distinguishability of the messages
with an optimal success probability. This scheme is shown to include (i) and
(ii) as special cases and continuously interpolate between them, which enables
the decoder to trade-off between the level of confidence desired to identify
the received messages and the success probability for doing so. The second
scheme, called multistage decoding, applies only for qudits ($d$-level quantum
systems with $d>2$) and consists of further attempts in the state
identification process in case of failure in the first one. We show that this

understanding of learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner

preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of
the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between
compression and prediction, successively, for each layer.
  In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of
the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\emph compression} of the
input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii)
The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes
small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift
to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion,
constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or
very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps
from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output
satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise
mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks.
(iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers.
Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be
explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly
(exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the
previous layer.

out of the high-index diamond is inefficient, the emission of coherent photons

photonic engineering hinges on nano-fabrication yet it is notoriously difficult

In natu- ral images, there is a strong correlation between adjacent pixels.
This correla- tion is disturbed by LSB matching generating new types of
correlations. The pre- sented method generates patterns from these correlations
and analyzes their varia- tion when random data are hidden. The experiments
performed for two different image databases show that the method yields better
classification accuracy com- pared to prior art for both LSB matching and HUGO

the data is distributed across many servers and can contain outliers. While
there has been a lot of work on these problems for worst-case instances, we
focus on gaining a finer understanding through the lens of beyond worst-case
analysis. Our main motivation is the following: for many applications such as
clustering proteins by function or clustering communities in a social network,
there is some unknown target clustering, and the hope is that running a
$k$-median or $k$-means algorithm will produce clusterings which are close to
matching the target clustering. Worst-case results can guarantee constant
factor approximations to the optimal $k$-median or $k$-means objective value,
but not closeness to the target clustering.
  Our first result is a distributed algorithm which returns a near-optimal
clustering assuming a natural notion of stability, namely, approximation
stability [Balcan et. al 2013], even when a constant fraction of the data are
outliers. The communication complexity is $\tilde O(sk+z)$ where $s$ is the
number of machines, $k$ is the number of clusters, and $z$ is the number of
outliers.
  Next, we show this amount of communication cannot be improved even in the
setting when the input satisfies various non-worst-case assumptions. We give a
matching $\Omega(sk+z)$ lower bound on the communication required both for
approximating the optimal $k$-means or $k$-median cost up to any constant, and
for returning a clustering that is close to the target clustering in Hamming
distance. These lower bounds hold even when the data satisfies approximation
stability or other common notions of stability, and the cluster sizes are
balanced. Therefore, $\Omega(sk+z)$ is a communication bottleneck, even for
real-world instances.

strength of quadratic explicit symmetry breaking one can still keep stable the
mass ratio of the fermionic and the pseudo-Goldstone excitation. At the same
time the mass ratio of the two bosonic excitations appears to approach a
limiting value depending only on the infrared value of the first ratio, but not
on the microscopic (ultraviolet) coupling values. The observations receive a
general interpretation by the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point located
in the symmetric phase. Understanding the general conditions for its existence
allows the construction of a similar theory with $U_L(2) \times U_R(2)$ chiral

neighborly de-convolutional neural network (\textit{NbNet}) to reconstruct face

the \textit{NbNet} reconstruction models, we augmented two benchmark face
datasets (VGG-Face and Multi-PIE) with a large collection of images synthesized
using a face generator. The proposed reconstruction was evaluated using type-I
(comparing the reconstructed images against the original face images used to
generate the deep template) and type-II (comparing the reconstructed images
against a different face image of the same subject) attacks. Given the images
reconstructed from \textit{NbNets}, we show that for verification, we achieve
TAR of 95.20\% (58.05\%) on LFW under type-I (type-II) attacks @ FAR of 0.1\%.
Besides, 96.58\% (92.84\%) of the images reconstruction from templates of

\textit{fa} in color FERET. Our study demonstrates the need to secure deep

a certain QFT and its asymptotics. The procedure heavily applies techniques
from singularity analysis and is related to resurgence. To utilize singularity
analysis, a representation of the zero-dimensional path integral as a
generalized hyperelliptic curve is deduced. As applications the full asymptotic

single-crystal diamond nanoindenter tips and nanocrystalline diamond atomic
force microscopy (AFM) tips under dry conditions, and the wear behavior is
compared to that of single-crystal silicon with both thin and thick native
oxide layers. We discovered a transition in the relative wear resistance of the
SiC samples compared to that of Si as a function of contact size. With larger
nanoindenter tips (tip radius around 370 nm), the wear resistances of both
sc-SiC and nc-SiC are higher than that of Si. This result is expected from the
Archard's equation because SiC is harder than Si. However, with the smaller AFM
tips (tip radius around 20 nm), the wear resistances of sc-SiC and nc-SiC are
lower than that of Si, despite the fact that the contact pressures are
comparable to those applied with the nanoindenter tips, and the plastic zones
are well-developed in both sets of wear experiments. We attribute the decrease
in the relative wear resistance of SiC compared to that of Si to a transition
from a wear regime dominated by the materials' resistance to plastic
deformation (i.e., hardness) to a regime dominated by the materials' resistance
to interfacial shear. This conclusion is supported by our AFM studies of
wearless friction, which reveal that the interfacial shear strength of SiC is
higher than that of Si. The contributions of surface roughness and surface
chemistry to differences in interfacial shear strength are also discussed.

not pristine, as it is continuously enriched by metals synthesised in Type Ia
(SNIa) and core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae since the major epoch of star
formation (z ~ 2-3). The cluster/group enrichment history and the mechanisms
responsible for releasing and mixing the metals can be probed via the radial
distribution of SNIa and SNcc products within the ICM. In this paper, we use
deep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations from a sample of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy
clusters, groups, and ellipticals (CHEERS) to constrain the average radial O,
Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni abundance profiles. The radial distributions of
all these elements, averaged over a large sample for the first time, represent
the best constrained profiles available currently. We find an overall decrease
of the Fe abundance with radius out to ~$0.9 r_{500}$ and ~$0.6 r_{500}$ for
clusters and groups, respectively, in good agreement with predictions from the
most recent hydrodynamical simulations. The average radial profiles of all the
other elements (X) are also centrally peaked and, when rescaled to their
average central X/Fe ratios, follow well the Fe profile out to at least
~0.5$r_{500}$. Using two sets of SNIa and SNcc yield models reproducing well
the X/Fe abundance pattern in the core, we find that, as predicted by recent
simulations, the relative contribution of SNIa (SNcc) to the total ICM
enrichment is consistent with being uniform at all radii, both for clusters and
groups. In addition to implying that the central metal peak is balanced between
SNIa and SNcc, our results suggest that the enriching SNIa and SNcc products
must share the same origin, and that the delay between the bulk of the SNIa and
SNcc explosions must be shorter than the timescale necessary to diffuse out the
metals.

about the modernization of power grids. We will focus our analysis on
demand-response policies based on automatic decisions by the so-called smart
home appliances. Following the usual design approach, each individual appliance
has access to a universal signal (e.g. grid frequency or electricity price)
that is believed to indicate the system state. Such information is then used as
the basis of the appliances' individual decisions. While each single device has
a negligible impact in the system, the aggregate effect of the distributed
appliances' reactions is expect to bring improvements in the system efficiency;
this effect is the demand-response policy goal. The smartness of such an ideal
system, composed by isolated appliances with their individual decisions, but
connected in the same physical grid, may worsen the system stability. This
first-sight undesirable outcome comes as a consequence of synchronization among
agents that are subject to the same signal. We argue that this effect is in
fact byproduct of methodological choices, which are many times implicit. To
support this claim, we employ a different approach that understands the
electricity system as constituted by physical, informational and regulatory
(networked and structured) layers that cannot be reduced to only one or two of
them, but have to be viewed as an organic whole. By classifying its structure
under this lens, more appropriate management tools can be designed by looking
at the system totality in action. Two examples are provided to illustrate the
strength of this modeling.

endoscopic camera tracking and salient point mapping. We then develop a robust
global 3D surface reconstruction frame- work based on the sparse point clouds
extracted from the SLAM framework. Our approach is to combine an outlier

employ Poisson surface reconstruction to obtain smooth surfaces from the

  Object or Human Intervention",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fusion of heterogeneous extroceptive sensors is the most effient and
effective way to representing the environment precisely, as it overcomes
various defects of each homogeneous sensor. The rigid transformation (aka.
extrinsic parameters) of heterogeneous sensory systems should be available
before precisely fusing the multisensor information. Researchers have proposed
several approaches to estimating the extrinsic parameters. These approaches
require either auxiliary objects, like chessboards, or extra help from human to
select correspondences. In this paper, we proposed a novel extrinsic
calibration approach for the extrinsic calibration of range and image sensors.
As far as we know, it is the first automatic approach with no requirement of
auxiliary objects or any human interventions. First, we estimate the initial
extrinsic parameters from the individual motion of the range finder and the
camera. Then we extract lines in the image and point-cloud pairs, to refine the
line feature associations by the initial extrinsic parameters. At the end, we
discussed the degenerate case which may lead to the algorithm failure and
validate our approach by simulation. The results indicate high-precision
extrinsic calibration results against the ground-truth.

Fluids 2, 094101 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.094101",,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we present observable consequences of parity-violating odd
viscosity term in incompressible 2+1D hydrodynamics. For boundary conditions
depending on the velocity field (flow) alone we show that: (i) The fluid flow
quantified by the velocity field is independent of odd viscosity, (ii) The
force acting on a closed contour is independent of odd viscosity, and (iii) The
odd viscosity part of torque on a closed contour is proportional to the rate of
change of area enclosed by the contour with the proportionality constant being
twice the odd viscosity. The last statement allows us to define a measurement
protocol of {\it odd viscostance} in analogy to Hall resistance measurements.
We also consider {\it no-stress} boundary conditions which explicitly depend on
odd viscosity. A classic hydrodynamics problem with no-stress boundary
conditions is that of a bubble in a planar Stokes flow. We solve this problem
exactly for shear and hyperbolic flows and show that the steady-state shape of
the bubble in the shear flow depends explicitly on the value of odd viscosity.

  magnetic dipole approach",,,"10.1103/PhysRevB.95.125411",,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The many-body radiative heat transfer theory [P. Ben-Abdallah, S.-A. Biehs,
and K. Joulain, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 114301 (2011)] only considered the
contribution from the electric dipole moment. For metal particles, however, the
magnetic dipole moment due to eddy current plays an important role, which can
further couple with the electric dipole moment to introduce crossed terms. In
this work, we develop coupled electric and magnetic dipole (CEMD) approach for
the radiative heat transfer in a collection of objects in mutual interaction.
Due to the coupled electric and magnetic interactions, four terms, namely the
electric-electric, the electric-magnetic, the magnetic-electric and the
magnetic-magnetic terms, contribute to the radiative heat flux and the local
energy density. The CEMD is applied to study the radiative heat transfer
between various dimers of nanoparticles. It is found that each of the four
terms can dominate the radiative heat transfer depending on the position and
composition of particles. Moreover, near-field many-body interactions are
studied by CEMD considering both dielectric and metallic nanoparticles. The
near-field radiative heat flux and local energy density can be greatly
increased when the particles are in coupled resonances. Surface plasmon
polariton and surface phonon polariton can be coupled to enhance the radiative
heat flux.
