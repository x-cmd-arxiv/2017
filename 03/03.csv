about the thermal freeze-out as the dominant mechanism for generating dark

spectroscopy with signal detectable from 0.8--2.3$\mu$m, as well as additional
photometry in the mid-infrared using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Combined with
a VLT/HAWK-I astrometric parallax, this enabled a full characterisation of the
absolute flux from the visible to 5$\mu$m, encompassing more than 90\% of the
expected energy emitted by such a cool late T-type object. Our analysis of the
spectrum also provided the radial velocity and therefore the determination of
its full 3-D kinematics. While our new spectrum confirms the low gravity and/or
high metallicity of CFBDSIR2149, the parallax and kinematics safely rule out
membership to any known young moving group, including AB~Doradus. We use the
equivalent width of the KI doublet at 1.25$\mu$m as a promising tool to
discriminate the effects of low-gravity from the effects of high-metallicity on
the emission spectra of cool atmospheres. In the case of CFBDSIR2149, the
observed KI doublet clearly favours the low-gravity solution. CFBDSIR2149 is
therefore a peculiar late-T dwarf that is probably a young, planetary-mass

that are inaccessible by direct simulations due to their complexity, for
example, in the highly turbulent regime. However, their accuracy and success
depends on a proper subgrid-scale (SGS) model that accounts for the unresolved
scales in the simulation. We evaluate the applicability of two traditional SGS
models, namely the eddy-viscosity (EV) and the scale-similarity (SS) model, and
one recently proposed nonlinear (NL) SGS model in the realm of compressible MHD
turbulence. Using 209 simulations of decaying, supersonic (initial sonic Mach
number of ~3) MHD turbulence with a shock-capturing scheme and varying
resolution, SGS model and filter, we analyze the ensemble statistics of kinetic
and magnetic energy spectra and structure functions. Furthermore, we compare
the temporal evolution of lower and higher order statistical moments of the
spatial distributions of kinetic and magnetic energy, vorticity, current
density, and dilatation magnitudes. We find no statistical influence on the
evolution of the flow by any model if grid-scale quantities are used to
calculate SGS contributions. In addition, the SS models, which employ an
explicit filter, have no impact in general. On the contrary, both EV and NL
models change the statistics if an explicit filter is used. For example, they
slightly increase the dissipation on the smallest scales. We demonstrate that
the nonlinear model improves higher order statistics already with a small
explicit filter, i.e. a three-point stencil. The results of e.g. the structure
functions or the skewness and kurtosis of the current density distribution are
closer to the ones obtained from simulations at higher resolution. We conclude
that the nonlinear model with a small explicit filter is suitable for
application in more complex scenarios when higher order statistics are
important.

$|U_{e4}|^2$, $|U_{\mu4}|^2$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2$ leads to three allowed
regions with narrow $\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}$ widths at $ \Delta m^2_{41} \approx
1.7 $ (best-fit), 1.3 (at $2\sigma$), 2.4 (at $3\sigma$) eV$^2$. The
restrictions of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with respect to
our previous global fits are mainly due to the NEOS constraints. We present a

anomalies are due to active-sterile neutrino oscillations or not.

method to resolve the sign problem for complex actions. However, this algorithm
often meets a difficulty in actual Monte Carlo calculations because the
configuration space is not easily explored due to the infinitely high potential
barriers between different thimbles. In this paper, we propose to use the flow
time of the antiholomorphic gradient flow as an auxiliary variable for the
highly multimodal distribution. To illustrate this, we implement the parallel
tempering method by taking the flow time as a tempering parameter. In this
algorithm, we can take the maximum flow time to be sufficiently large such that
the sign problem disappears there, and two separate modes are connected through
configurations at small flow times. To exemplify that this algorithm does work,
we investigate the (0+1)-dimensional massive Thirring model at finite density
and show that our algorithm correctly reproduces the analytic results for large
flow times such as T=2.

the true projector $\mathbf{P}_r$ on the subspace of the $r$-th eigenvalue and
its empirical counterpart $\widehat{\mathbf{P}}_r$ in terms of the effective

crystal fibers (SR-PCFs) occurs when the capillary-to-core diameter ratio d/D =

higher-order mode suppression can be recovered by spinning the preform during
fiber drawing, thus introducing a continuous helical twist. This geometrically
increases the effective axial propagation constant (initially too low) of the
LP01-like modes of the capillaries surrounding the core, enabling robust
single-mode operation. The effect is explored by means of extensive numerical
modeling, an analytical model and a series of experiments. Prism-assisted
side-coupling is used to investigate the losses and near-field patterns of
individual fiber modes in both the straight and twisted cases. More than 12
dB/m improvement in higher order mode suppression is achieved experimentally in
a twisted PCF. The measurements also show that the higher order mode profiles
change with twist rate, as predicted by numerical simulations. Helical twisting
offers an additional tool for achieving effectively endlessly single-mode
operation in hollow-core SR-PCFs.

that a phase shift of the BAO spectrum maps to a characteristic sign change in
the real space correlation function and that this feature cannot be generated

explicit computation, valid to all orders in cosmological perturbation theory.
Finally, we provide a nonperturbative argument using general analytic

Results: Mixtures of live and dead Escherichia coli with live:dead

stained using SYTO 9 and propidium iodide and 6 {\mu}m reference beads were
added. Bacteria present in live samples were enumerated by agar plate counting.
Bacteria present in dead samples were enumerated by agar plate counting before

presented flow cytometry method and agar plate counts for live (R2 = 0.99) and
dead E. coli (R2 = 0.93) concentrations of ca. 104 to 108 bacteria ml-1 within

later restore the state of a running process. The new plugin model for the
upcoming version 3.0 of DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is
described here. This plugin model allows a target application to disconnect
from the hardware emulator at checkpoint time and then re-connect to a possibly
different hardware emulator at the time of restart. The DMTCP plugin model is
important in allowing three distinct parties to seamlessly inter-operate. The
three parties are: the EDA designer, who is concerned with formal verification
of a circuit design; the DMTCP developers, who are concerned with providing
transparent checkpointing during the circuit emulation; and the hardware
emulator vendor, who provides a plugin library that responds to checkpoint,
restart, and other events.
  The new plugin model is an example of process-level virtualization:
virtualization of external abstractions from within a process. This capability
is motivated by scenarios for testing circuit models with the help of a
hardware emulator. The plugin model enables a three-way collaboration: allowing
a circuit designer and emulator vendor to each contribute separate proprietary
plugins while sharing an open source software framework from the DMTCP
developers. This provides a more flexible platform, where different fault
injection models based on plugins can be designed within the DMTCP
checkpointing framework. After initialization, one restarts from a checkpointed
state under the control of the desired plugin. This restart saves the time
spent in simulating the initialization phase, while enabling fault injection
exactly at the region of interest. Upon restart, one can inject faults or
otherwise modify the remainder of the simulation. The work concludes with a
brief survey of checkpointing and process-level virtualization.

well-studied matching problems, which are simpler, faster, more accurate,

these results is a deterministic distributed rounding method for certain linear
programs, which is the first such rounding method, to our knowledge. A sampling
of our end results is as follows.
  -- An $O(\log^2 \Delta\cdot \log n)$-round deterministic distributed
algorithm for computing a maximal matching, in $n$-node graphs with maximum
degree $\Delta$. This is the first improvement in about 20 years over the
celebrated $O(\log^4 n)$-round algorithm of Ha\'n\'ckowiak, Karo\'nski, and
Panconesi [SODA'98, PODC'99].
  -- A deterministic distributed algorithm for computing a
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation of maximum matching in $O(\log^2 \Delta \cdot
\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \log^ * n)$ rounds. This is exponentially faster
than the classic $O(\Delta +\log^* n)$-round $2$-approximation of Panconesi and
Rizzi [DIST'01]. With some modifications, the algorithm can also find an
$\varepsilon$-maximal matching which leaves only an $\varepsilon$-fraction of
the edges on unmatched nodes.
  -- An $O(\log^2 \Delta \cdot \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \log^ * n)$-round
deterministic distributed algorithm for computing a
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation of a maximum weighted matching, and also for
the more general problem of maximum weighted $b$-matching. These improve over
the $O(\log^4 n \cdot \log_{1+\varepsilon} W)$-round

We derive improved constraints using low-energy XENON10 and XENON100
ionization-only data. For XENON10, in addition to including electron-recoil
data corresponding to about $1-3$ electrons, we include for the first time
events with $\gtrsim 4$ electrons. Assuming the scattering is momentum
independent, this strengthens a previous cross-section bound by almost an order
of magnitude for dark matter masses above 50 MeV. The available XENON100 data
corresponds to events with $\gtrsim 4$ electrons, and leads to a constraint
that is comparable to the XENON10 bound above 50 MeV. We demonstrate that a
search for an annual modulation signal in upcoming xenon experiments (XENON1T,
XENONnT, LZ) could substantially improve the above bounds even in the presence
of large backgrounds. We also emphasize that in simple benchmark models of
sub-GeV dark matter, the dark matter-electron scattering rate can be as high as
one event every ten (two) seconds in the XENON1T (XENONnT or LZ) experiments,
without being in conflict with any other known experimental bounds. While there
are several sources of backgrounds that can produce single- or few-electron
events, a large event rate can be consistent with a dark matter signal and
should not be simply written off as purely a detector curiosity. This fact
motivates a detailed analysis of the ionization-only (""S2-only"") data, taking
into account the expected annual modulation spectrum of the signal rate, as
well as the DM-induced electron-recoil spectra, which are another powerful
discriminant between signal and background.

their light curves, which is generally thought to be due to the shock cooling
of extended hydrogen-rich material surrounding the helium core of the exploding
star. The recent SN 2016gkg was a nearby Type IIb SN discovered shortly after
explosion, which makes it an excellent candidate for studying this first peak.
We numerically explode a large grid of extended envelope models and compare
these to SN 2016gkg to investigate what constraints can be derived from its
light curve. This includes exploring density profiles for both a convective
envelope and an optically thick steady-state wind, the latter of which has not
typically been considered for Type IIb SNe models. We find that roughly
$\sim0.02\,M_\odot$ of extended material with a radius of
$\approx180-260\,R_\odot$ reproduces the photometric light curve data,
consistent with pre-explosion imaging. These values are independent of the
assumed density profile of this material, although a convective profile
provides a somewhat better fit. We infer from our modeling that the explosion
must have occurred within $\approx2-3\,{\rm hrs}$ of the first observed data
point, demonstrating that this event was caught very close to the moment of
explosion. Nevertheless, our best-fitting one-dimensional models overpredict
the earliest velocity measurements, which suggests that the hydrogen-rich

disc galaxies, using high resolution simulations of major mergers whose
remnants have downbending radial density profiles (type II). As described in
the previous papers of this series, in this scenario, most of the disc mass is
acquired after the collision via accretion from a hot gaseous halo. We find
that the inner and outer disc scalelengths, as well as the break radius,
correlate with the total angular momentum of the initial merging system, and
are larger for high angular momentum systems. We follow the angular momentum
redistribution in our simulated galaxies, and find that, like the mass, the
disc angular momentum is acquired via accretion, i.e. to the detriment of the
gaseous halo. Furthermore, high angular momentum systems give more angular
momentum to their discs, which affects directly their radial density profile.
Adding simulations of isolated galaxies to our sample, we find that the
correlations are valid also for disc galaxies evolved in isolation. We show
that the outer part of the disc at the end of the simulation is populated
mainly by inside-out stellar migration, and that in galaxies with higher
angular momentum, stars travel radially further out. This, however, does not
mean that outer disc stars (in type II discs) were mostly born in the inner
disc. Indeed, generally the break radius increases over time, and not taking
this into account leads to overestimating the number of stars born in the inner
disc.

detect this signal by cross-correlating CMB maps with quasar catalogs. Using a

of semiconductor photocathodes in electron accelerators. These materials are
extremely susceptible to degradation in efficiency through multiple mechanisms
related to contamination from the local imperfect vacuum environment of the
host photoinjector. Few-layer graphene has been predicted to permit a modified
photoemission response of protected photocathode surfaces, and recent
experiments of single-layer graphene on copper have begun to confirm these
predictions for single crystal metallic photocathodes. Unlike metallic
photoemitters, the integration of an ultra-thin graphene barrier film with
conventional semiconductor photocathode growth processes is not
straightforward. A first step toward addressing this challenge is the growth
and characterization of technologically relevant, high quantum efficiency
bialkali photocathodes grown on ultra-thin free-standing graphene substrates.
Photocathode growth on free-standing graphene provides the opportunity to
integrate these two materials and study their interaction. Specifically,
spectral response features and photoemission stability of cathodes grown on
graphene substrates are compared to those deposited on established substrates.
In addition we observed an increase of work function for the graphene
encapsulated bialkali photocathode surfaces, which is predicted by our
calculations. The results provide a unique demonstration of bialkali

momentum dissipation. We obtain AdS planar black hole solutions in the theory
and we calculate the holographic DC conductivity of the dual field theory. The
theory has a critical point $\alpha + \gamma \Lambda = 0$, beyond which the
kinetic terms of the Horndeski axions become ghost-like. The conductivity as a
function of temperature behaves qualitatively like that of a conductor below
the critical point, becoming semiconductor-like at the critical point. Beyond
the critical point, the ghost-like nature of the Horndeski fields is associated
with the onset of unphysical singular or negative conductivities. Some further
generalisations of the above theories are considered also.

a bunch of changes around the world. Interest rates that were known to follow

work sets the basis to define a valid model that considers the post-crisis
world assumptions for the Mexican swap market. The model used in this work was
the proposed by Fujii, Shimada and Takahashi in [Fujii et. al., 2010b]. This
model allow us to value interest rate derivatives and future cash flows with
the existence of a collateral agreement (with a collateral currency). In this
document we build the discounting and projection curves for MXN interest rate
derivatives considering the collateral currencies: USD, EUR and MXN. Also, we
present the pricing when the derivative is uncollateralized. Finally, we show
the effect of the cross-currency swaps when valuing through different

show largely unexplored physics. The main idea relies on the adiabatic passage
of a thermal ensemble under slow variations of the system Hamiltonian. If the
temperature of the initial thermal ensemble is either zero or infinite the
ensemble after the passage is a simple thermal one with the same vanishing or
infinite temperature. However, for any finite non-zero temperature intriguing
non-thermal ensembles can be achieved. We exemplify this in: (a) a single
oscillator (b) a dimerized interacting one dimensional chain of spinless
fermions, (c) a BCS-type superconductor and (d) the topological Kitaev chain.
We solve these models with a combination of methods; either exactly,
numerically using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or within an
approximate functional renormalization group (FRG) scheme. The designed states
show strongly non-thermal behavior in each of the considered models. For
example, for the chain of spinless fermions we exemplify how long ranged
non-thermal power-law correlations can be stabilized and for the Kitaev chain
we elucidate how the non-thermal ensemble can largely alter the transition
temperature separating topological and trivial phases.

to have approached Jupiter to 0.005 AU on -2251 November 7, in general
conformity with Marsden's (1999) proposal of a Jovian encounter nearly 4300 yr
ago. The variations of sizable nongravitational effects with heliocentric
distance correlate with the evolution of outgassing, asymmetric relative to
perihelion. The future orbital period will shorten to ~1000 yr because of
orbital-cascade resonance effects. We find that the sublimation curves of
parent molecules are fitted with the type of a law used for the
nongravitational acceleration, determine their orbit-integrated mass loss, and
conclude that the share of water ice was at most 57%, and possibly less than
50%, of the total outgassed mass. Even though organic parent molecules (many
still unidentified) had very low abundances relative to water individually,
their high molar mass and sheer number made them, summarily, important
potential mass contributors to the total production of gas. The mass loss of
dust per orbit exceeded that of water ice by a factor of ~12, a dust loading
high enough to imply a major role for heavy organic molecules of low volatility
in accelerating the minuscule dust particles in the expanding halos to terminal
velocities as high as 0.7 km s^{-1}. In Part II, the comet's nucleus will be

that every infinite sequence of zeroes and ones has an associated filter of
intervals with respect to which it is computably random. It may happen that
none of these intervals is precise, which justifies the title of this paper. We
illustrate this by showing that computable randomness associated with
non-stationary precise forecasting systems can be captured by a stationary
interval forecast, which must then be less precise: a gain in model simplicity
is thus paid for by a loss in precision.

simulations of droplet formation of Newtonian fluids in microfluidic T-junction
devices. To evaluate the performance of the VOF method we examined the regimes
of drop formation and determined droplet size as a function of system
parameters. Comparison of the simulation results with four sets of experimental
data from the literature showed good agreement, validating the VOF method.
Motivated by the lack of adequate studies investigating the influence of
viscosity ratio ({\lambda}) on the generated droplet size, we mapped the
dependence of drop volume on capillary number (0.001 < Ca < 0.5) and viscosity
ratio (0.01 < {\lambda} < 15). We find that for all viscosity ratios
investigated, droplet size decreases with increase in capillary number.
However, the reduction in droplet size with capillary number is stronger for
{\lambda} < 1 than for {\lambda} > 1. In addition, we find that at a given
capillary number, the size of droplets does not vary appreciably when {\lambda}
< 1, while it increases when {\lambda} > 1. We develop an analytical model for
predicting droplet size that includes a viscosity-dependent breakup time for
the dispersed phase. This improved model successfully predicts the effects of
viscosity ratio observed in simulations. Results from this study are useful for
the design of lab-on-chip technologies and manufacture of microfluidic
emulsions, where there is a need to know how system parameters influence

as its natural frequencies and mode shapes. One application of modal analysis
is in structural health monitoring (SHM), where a network of sensors may be
used to collect vibration data from a physical structure such as a building or
bridge. There is a growing interest in developing automated techniques for SHM
based on data collected in a wireless sensor network. In order to conserve
power and extend battery life, however, it is desirable to minimize the amount
of data that must be collected and transmitted in such a sensor network. In
this paper, we highlight the fact that modal analysis can be formulated as an
atomic norm minimization (ANM) problem, which can be solved efficiently and in
some cases recover perfectly a structure's mode shapes and frequencies. We
survey a broad class of sampling and compression strategies that one might
consider in a physical sensor network, and we provide bounds on the sample
complexity of these compressive schemes in order to recover a structure's mode
shapes and frequencies via ANM. A main contribution of our paper is to
establish a bound on the sample complexity of modal analysis with random
temporal compression, and in this scenario we prove that the samples per sensor
can actually decrease as the number of sensors increases. We also extend an
atomic norm denoising problem to the multiple measurement vector (MMV) setting

average value of its entries and the variance. Here we consider the problem in
the limit of weak competition and large variance. Using a yes/no interaction
model, we show that the number of SUs corresponds to the number of maximum
cliques in a network close to its fully connected limit. The number of SUs
grows exponentially with the number of species in this limit, unless the

programming, or more specifically, of the Least-Weight Subsequence (LWS)
problem: Given a sequence of $n$ data items together with weights for every
pair of the items, the task is to determine a subsequence $S$ minimizing the
total weight of the pairs adjacent in $S$. A large number of natural problems
can be formulated as LWS problems, yielding obvious $O(n^2)$-time solutions.
  In many interesting instances, the $O(n^2)$-many weights can be succinctly
represented. Yet except for near-linear time algorithms for some specific
special cases, little is known about when an LWS instantiation admits a
subquadratic-time algorithm and when it does not. In particular, no lower
bounds for LWS instantiations have been known before. In an attempt to remedy
this situation, we provide a general approach to study the fine-grained
complexity of succinct instantiations of the LWS problem. In particular, given
an LWS instantiation we identify a highly parallel core problem that is
subquadratically equivalent. This provides either an explanation for the
apparent hardness of the problem or an avenue to find improved algorithms as
the case may be.
  More specifically, we prove subquadratic equivalences between the following
pairs (an LWS instantiation and the corresponding core problem) of problems: a
low-rank version of LWS and minimum inner product, finding the longest chain of
nested boxes and vector domination, and a coin change problem which is closely
related to the knapsack problem and (min,+)-convolution. Using these
equivalences and known SETH-hardness results for some of the core problems, we
deduce tight conditional lower bounds for the corresponding LWS instantiations.
We also establish the (min,+)-convolution-hardness of the knapsack problem.

semimetal with two Dirac points protected by non-symmorphic symmetries. The
tunnel barrier can be arranged by a magnetic exchange potential which opens a
gap at the Dirac points which can be induced by a magnetic proximity effect of
a ferromagnetic insulator. We found that the tunnel decay length increases with
a decrease in the strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and moreover the
dependence is attributed to the correlation of sublattice and spin degree of
freedoms which lead to symmetry-protected Dirac points. The tunnel probability
is quite different in two Dirac points, and thus the tunnel effect can be
applied to the highly-selective valley filter.

Fluid Mech., Vol. 816, 2017, pp. 5-42","10.1017/jfm.2017.69",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Roughness predominantly alters the near-wall region of turbulent flow while
the outer layer remains similar. This makes it a prime candidate for the
minimal-span channel, which only captures the near-wall flow by restricting the
spanwise channel width to be of the order of a few hundred viscous units.
Recently, Chung et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 773, 2015, pp. 418-431) showed
that a minimal-span channel can accurately characterise the hydraulic behaviour
of roughness. Following this, we aim to investigate the fundamental dynamics of
the minimal-span channel framework with an eye towards further improving
performance. The streamwise domain length of the channel is investigated with
the minimum length found to be three times the spanwise width or 1000 viscous
units, whichever is longer. A half-height (open) channel with slip wall is
shown to reproduce the near-wall behaviour seen in a standard channel, but with
half the number of grid points. Next, a forcing model is introduced into the
outer layer of a half-height channel to reduce the high streamwise velocity.
Finally, an investigation is conducted to see if varying the roughness Reynolds
number with time is a feasible method for obtaining the full hydraulic
behaviour of a rough surface. An empirical costing argument is developed to
determine the cost in terms of CPU hours of minimal-span channel simulations a
priori. This argument involves counting the number of eddy lifespans in the
channel, which is then related to the statistical uncertainty of the streamwise
velocity. For a given statistical uncertainty in the roughness function, this
can then be used to determine the simulation run time. Following this, a
finite-volume code with a body-fitted grid is used to determine the roughness
function for square-based pyramids using the above insights. Good agreement
with the literature for the same roughness geometry is observed.

spectrum of cosmological curvature perturbations due to the effect of a thin
atmosphere accreting into our 3-brane. The spectrum is scale-invariant on small
scales and red on intermediate scales, but becomes blue on scales larger than
the height of the atmosphere. While this behaviour is broadly consistent with
the non-parametric measurements of the primordial scalar power spectrum, it is
marginally disfavoured relative to a simple power law (at 2.7$\sigma$ level).
Furthermore, we find that the best fit nucleation temperature of our 3-brane is
at least 3 orders of magnitude larger than the 5D Planck mass, suggesting an

peaked at absolute $M_g=-17.2$ mag. The maximum bolometric luminosity (from
optical and UV) was $L_p~\simeq~(1.0\,\pm\,0.15) \times 10^{43}$ erg/s, an
order of magnitude fainter than any other optical TDE discovered so far. The
luminosity in the first 60 days is consistent with an exponential decay, with
$L \propto e^{-(t-t_0)/\tau}$, where $t_0$=~57631.0 (MJD) and $\tau\simeq 15$
days. The X-ray shows a marginal detection at $L_X=2.4^{1.9}_{-1.1}\times

detected down to 3$\sigma$, providing upper limits for monochromatic radio
luminosity of $\nu L_{\nu} < 2.3\times10^{36}$ erg/s and $\nu L_{\nu}<1.7\times
10^{37}$ erg/s (VLA, 6.1 and 22 GHz). The blackbody temperature, obtained from
combined \textit{Swift} UV and optical photometry, shows a constant value of
19,000 K. The transient spectrum at peak is characterized by broad He II and
H$\alpha$ emission lines, with an FWHM of about 14,000 km/s and 10,000 km/s

The spectrum of the host is dominated by strong Balmer absorption lines, which
are consistent with a post-starburst (E+A) galaxy with an age of $\sim$650 Myr
and solar metallicity. The characteristics of iPTF16fnl make it an outlier on
both luminosity and decay timescales, as compared to other optically selected
TDEs. The discovery of such a faint optical event suggests a higher rate of
tidal disruptions, as low luminosity events may have gone unnoticed in previous

whose components are resonantly coupled by a standing optical wave, as well as
in terms of the bimodal light propagation in periodically twisted fibers. The
system supports various types of gap solitons (GSs), which are constructed, and
their stability is investigated, in the first two finite bandgaps of the
underlying spectrum. These include on- and off-site-centered solitons (the GSs
of the off-site type are additionally categorized as spatially even and odd
ones), which may be symmetric or antisymmetric, with respect to the coupled
components. The GSs are chiefly stable in the first finite bandgap, and
unstable in the second one. In addition to that, there are narrow regions near
the right edge of the first bandgap, and in the second one, which feature
intricate alternation of stability and instability. Unstable solitons evolve
into robust breathers or spatially confined turbulent modes. On-site-centered
GSs are also considered in a version of the system which is made asymmetric by
the Zeeman effect, or by birefringence of the optical fiber. A region of
alternate stability is found in the latter case too. In the limit of strong
asymmetry, GSs are obtained in a semi-analytical approximation, which reduces
two coupled GPEs to a single one with an effective lattice potential.

attention due to the dependency structure that often appears in real datasets.
To construct a dGEV model, a natural approach is to assume that some parameters
in the model are time-varying. A previous study has shown that a dependent
Gumbel process can be naturally incorporated into a GEV model. The model is a
nonlinear state space model with a hidden state that follows a Markov process,
with its innovation following a Gumbel distribution. Inference may be made for
the model using Bayesian methods, sampling the hidden process from a mixture
normal distribution, used to approximate the Gumbel distribution. Thus the
response follows an approximate GEV model. We propose a new model in which each
marginal distribution is an exact GEV distribution. We use a variable
transformation to combine the marginal CDF of a Gumbel distribution with the
standard normal copula. Then our model is a nonlinear state space model in
which the hidden state equation is Gaussian. We analyze this model using
Bayesian methods, and sample the elements of the state vector using particle
Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS). The PGAS algorithm turns out to be very
efficient in solving nonlinear state space models. We also show our model is
flexible enough to incorporate seasonality.

extensile flows by consuming a chemical fuel. We first describe the system
through a Doi-Onsager kinetic theory based on microscopic modeling. This theory
captures the active stresses produced by the particles that can drive
hydrodynamic instabilities, as well as the steric interactions of rod-like
particles that lead to nematic alignment. This active nematic system yields
complex flows and disclination defect dynamics very similar to phenomenological
Landau-deGennes Q-tensor theories for active nematic fluids, as well as by more
complex Doi-Onsager theories for polar microtubule/motor-protein systems. We
apply the quasi-equilibrium Bingham closure, used to study suspensions of
passive microscopic rods, to develop a non-standard Q-tensor theory. We
demonstrate through simulation that this ""BQ-tensor"" theory gives an excellent
analytical and statistical accounting of the suspension's complex dynamics, at
a far reduced computational cost. Finally, we apply the BQ-tensor model to
study the dynamics of Extensor suspensions in circular and bi-concave domains.
In circular domains, we reproduce previous results for systems with weak
nematic alignment, but for strong alignment find novel dynamics with
activity-controlled defect production and absorption at the boundaries of the

bid reduction capacity into the wholesale electricity market by asking their
customers under contract to temporarily reduce their consumption in exchange
for a monetary incentive. To contribute to the analysis of consumer behavior in

expectation-maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, is used to infer the
ratio of photons-to-neutrons in each measurement. Therefore, the probability
space adapts to data with varying photon-to-neutron ratios. A time-correlated
measurement of Am-Be and separate measurements of $^{137}$Cs, $^{60}$Co and

imaginary part of conductivity, $\mathrm{Im}[\sigma ]$, diverges as $\omega
\rightarrow 0$. For the massive gravity, we find that $\mathrm{Im}[\sigma ]$ is
zero at $\omega =0$ and becomes larger as $q$\ increases (temperature
decreases), which is in contrast to the massless gravity. Interestingly, we
observe that in contrast to the massless case, $\mathrm{Re}[\sigma ]$ has a
maximum value at $\omega =0$ (known as the Drude peak) for $p=\left( n+1\right)

the prices in the first stage. In the second stage, consumers decide on their

maximize their utility. To this end, we derive theoretical statements under

models for a wide range of applications. In previous work, learning on such
models has been dominated by contrastive divergence~(CD) and its variants.
Belief propagation~(BP) algorithms are believed to be slow for structured
prediction on conditional RBMs~(e.g., Mnih et al. [2011]), and not as good as
CD when applied in learning~(e.g., Larochelle et al. [2012]). In this work, we
present a matrix-based implementation of belief propagation algorithms on
CRBMs, which is easily scalable to tens of thousands of visible and hidden
units. We demonstrate that, in both maximum likelihood and max-margin learning,
training conditional RBMs with BP as the inference routine can provide
significantly better results than current state-of-the-art CD methods on
structured prediction problems. We also include practical guidelines on
training CRBMs with BP, and some insights on the interaction of learning and
inference algorithms for CRBMs.

of Distributions Differences (ODD). The algorithm aims to find a transformation
from the feature space to a new space where the instances in the same class are

multiobjective optimization problem that is solved by a hybrid of an
evolutionary strategy and the Quasi-Newton method. The choice of the

show that the algorithm can outperform 6 other state-of-the-art classification

analysis, multi-layer perceptrons, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors, in
12 standard classification datasets. Our results show that the method is less
sensitive to the imbalanced number of instances comparing to these methods. We
also show that ODD maintains its performance better than other classification

  UTV factorization",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This manuscript describes the randomized algorithm randUTV for computing a so
called UTV factorization efficiently. Given a matrix $A$, the algorithm
computes a factorization $A = UTV^{*}$, where $U$ and $V$ have orthonormal
columns, and $T$ is triangular (either upper or lower, whichever is preferred).
The algorithm randUTV is developed primarily to be a fast and easily
parallelized alternative to algorithms for computing the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). randUTV provides accuracy very close to that of the SVD
for problems such as low-rank approximation, solving ill-conditioned linear
systems, determining bases for various subspaces associated with the matrix,
etc. Moreover, randUTV produces highly accurate approximations to the singular
values of $A$. Unlike the SVD, the randomized algorithm proposed builds a UTV
factorization in an incremental, single-stage, and non-iterative way, making it
possible to halt the factorization process once a specified tolerance has been
met. Numerical experiments comparing the accuracy and speed of randUTV to the
SVD are presented. These experiments demonstrate that in comparison to column
pivoted QR, which is another factorization that is often used as a relatively
economic alternative to the SVD, randUTV compares favorably in terms of speed
while providing far higher accuracy.

spin density wave (SDW) ordering that occurs in these systems at temperatures
$T\sim$ (120 - 140) K, in close vicinity to a tetragonal/orthorhombic
transition, produces significant modifications in their magneto-transport
properties. While in the magnetically ordered phase the MR is positive and its
magnitude increases with decreasing temperatures, in the paramagnetic regime
the MR becomes vanishingly small. Above the spin density wave transition
temperature ($T_{\text{SDW}}$) the Hall coefficient $R_H$ is negative, small
and weakly temperature dependent, but a remarkable change of slope occurs in
the $R_H$ versus $T$ curves at $T = T_{\text{SDW}}$. The Hall coefficient
amplitude, while remaining negative, increases steadily and significantly as
the temperature is decreased below $T_{\text{SDW}}$ and down to $T =$ 20 K. The
qualitative behavior of both MR and Hall coefficient is weakly dependent on the
chemical substitution in the studied limit. The experiments provide strong
evidence that scattering of charge carriers by magnetic excitations has to be
taken into account to explain the behavior of the resistivity,
magnetoresistance and Hall effect in the ordered phase of the studied
compounds. Effects of multiple band conduction also must be considered for a
complete interpretation of the results.

Intelligent transportation network management systems. Understanding how the
traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to

and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current
traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing
component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the
information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems
are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a
decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term
congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes.
  We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node
accurately predicts its own congestion state in real-time based on the
congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from
the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more
suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance,
we introduce a regularized Euclidean loss function that favors high congestion
samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced
training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the
traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California.
Extensive experiments conducted on the designed benchmark reflect a successful

problem in computational social science. This paper presents an in-depth study
of popularity dynamics under external promotions, especially in predicting
popularity jumps of online videos, and determining effective and efficient
schedules to promote online content. The recently proposed Hawkes Intensity
Process (HIP) models popularity as a non-linear interplay between exogenous
stimuli and the endogenous reactions. Here, we propose two novel metrics based
on HIP: to describe popularity gain per unit of promotion, and to quantify the
time it takes for such effects to unfold. We make increasingly accurate
forecasts of future popularity by including information about the intrinsic
properties of the video, promotions it receives, and the non-linear effects of
popularity ranking. We illustrate by simulation the interplay between the
unfolding of popularity over time, and the time-sensitive value of resources.
Lastly, our model lends a novel explanation of the commonly adopted periodic
and constant promotion strategy in advertising, as increasing the perceived
viral potential. This study provides quantitative guidelines about setting
promotion schedules considering content virality, timing, and economics.

pure pyrochlore compounds to ambient pressure. These results indicate the high

Langevin heat baths at unequal temperatures are connected to the ends of the
one dimensional lattice via short-range harmonic interactions that drive the
system away from thermal equilibrium. In the nonequilibrium steady state the
heat current, thermal conductivity and temperature profiles are computed by
solving the equations of motion numerically. It is found that the conductivity
$\kappa$ has an interesting non-monotonic dependence with $\delta$ with a
maximum at $\delta = 2.0$ for this model. Moreover, at $\delta = 2.0$, $\kappa$
diverges almost linearly with system size $N$ and the temperature profile has a
negligible slope, as one expects in ballistic transport for an integrable
system. We demonstrate that the non-monotonic behavior of the conductivity and
the nearly ballistic thermal transport at $\delta = 2.0$ obtained under
nonequilibrium conditions can be explained consistently by studying the
variation of largest Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_{max}$ with $\delta$, and
excess energy diffusion in the equilibrium microcanonical system.

synthetic spectra from the BT-Settl13 model atmospheres gives an effective

  Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making (RLDM) 2017",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to evaluate a policy it is
common, given a large state space, to introduce some form of approximation
architecture for the value function (VF). The exact form of this architecture
can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the VF estimate, however, and
determining a suitable approximation architecture can often be a highly complex
task. Consequently there is a large amount of interest in the potential for
allowing RL algorithms to adaptively generate approximation architectures.
  We investigate a method of adapting approximation architectures which uses
feedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited certain states
to guide which areas of the state space to approximate with greater detail.
This method is ""unsupervised"" in the sense that it makes no direct reference to
reward or the VF estimate. We introduce an algorithm based upon this idea which
adapts a state aggregation approximation architecture on-line.
  A common method of scoring a VF estimate is to weight the squared Bellman
error of each state-action by the probability of that state-action occurring.
Adopting this scoring method, and assuming $S$ states, we demonstrate
theoretically that - provided (1) the number of cells $X$ in the state
aggregation architecture is of order $\sqrt{S}\log_2{S}\ln{S}$ or greater, (2)
the policy and transition function are close to deterministic, and (3) the
prior for the transition function is uniformly distributed - our algorithm,
used in conjunction with a suitable RL algorithm, can guarantee a score which
is arbitrarily close to zero as $S$ becomes large. It is able to do this
despite having only $O(X \log_2S)$ space complexity and negligible time
complexity. The results take advantage of certain properties of the stationary
distributions of Markov chains.

of such two types of hadronic molecules within the effective Lagrangian

$\bar{D}^* \Lambda_c$ channel with a branching ratio by 2 orders of magnitude
larger than to $\bar{D}\Lambda_c$, the $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ molecule decays to
these two channels with a difference of less than a factor of 2. Our results
show that the total decay width of $P_c(4380)$ as the spin-parity-${\frac32}^-$

corresponding value for the $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ molecule. It suggests that the

distributed supervisory control of discrete-event systems.Decomposition is
employed to reduce the number of events and localization is used to reduce the

observation and control scopes are restricted, whereas in localization only
control authority is restricted to the corresponding local controller. In this
paper, we propose a decomposition method by defining coparanormality property,
and by using relative observability property of a monolithic supervisor.
Coparanormality is a coobservation property defined based on paranormality
property for a set of natural projections.It is shown that each supervisor can
be coparanormal, provided a set of appropriate natural projections exist.
Moreover, it is proved that relative observability is a sufficient condition
for decomposition of a supervisor. Furthermore, the supervisor localization
procedure is generalized to find a set of local controllers for any partition
ofthe controllable events set. The implementation of such local controllers may
become easier in industrial systems.

numerous applications in ranking and personalization tasks such as link
prediction and tie strength detection. A common manifestation of user
similarity is based upon network structure: each user is represented by a
vector that represents the user's network connections, where pairwise cosine
similarity among these vectors defines user similarity. The predominant task
for user similarity applications is to discover all similar pairs that have a
pairwise cosine similarity value larger than a given threshold $\tau$. In
contrast to previous work where $\tau$ is assumed to be quite close to 1, we
focus on recommendation applications where $\tau$ is small, but still
meaningful. The all pairs cosine similarity problem is computationally
challenging on networks with billions of edges, and especially so for settings
with small $\tau$. To the best of our knowledge, there is no practical solution
for computing all user pairs with, say $\tau = 0.2$ on large social networks,
even using the power of distributed algorithms.
  Our work directly addresses this challenge by introducing a new algorithm ---
WHIMP --- that solves this problem efficiently in the MapReduce model. The key
insight in WHIMP is to combine the ""wedge-sampling"" approach of Cohen-Lewis for
approximate matrix multiplication with the SimHash random projection techniques
of Charikar. We provide a theoretical analysis of WHIMP, proving that it has
near optimal communication costs while maintaining computation cost comparable
with the state of the art. We also empirically demonstrate WHIMP's scalability
by computing all highly similar pairs on four massive data sets, and show that
it accurately finds high similarity pairs. In particular, we note that WHIMP
successfully processes the entire Twitter network, which has tens of billions
of edges.

show that this \textbf{ACVENN} class of states forms a set which is convex and

do not possess any memory besides their classical input and they take turns
performing unitary operations on a pure quantum state that they exchange
between them. Most known quantum protocols are of this type and recently a deep
connection between memoryless protocols and Bell inequality violations has been
explored recently by Buhrman et al. We study the information cost of memoryless
quantum protocols by looking at a canonical problem: bounded-round quantum
communication protocols for the one-bit AND function. We prove directly a tight
lower bound of $\Theta(\log(k) / k)$ for the information cost of AND for
$k$-round memoryless quantum protocols and for the input distribution needed
for the Disjointness function. It is not clear if memoryless protocols allow
for a reduction between AND and Disjointness, due to the absence of private
workspaces. We enhance the model by allowing the players to keep in their
private classical workspace apart from their input also some classical private
coins. Surprisingly, we show that every quantum protocol can be transformed
into an equivalent quantum protocol with private coins that is perfectly
private, i.e. the players only learn the value of the function and nothing
more. Last, we consider the model where the players are allowed to use one-shot
coins, i.e. private coins that can be used only once during the protocol. While
in the classical case, private coins and one-shot coins are equivalent, in the
quantum case, we prove that they are not. More precisely, we show that every
quantum memoryless protocol with one-bit inputs that uses one-shot coins can be
transformed into a memoryless quantum protocol without private coins and
without increasing too much its information cost. Hence, while private coins

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, generalizations of Bernstein bridges and
Bernstein loops, whose laws may evolve in space in a non trivial way.
Specifically, I examine in detail the time development of the probability of

the volume coarsely behaves like the minima of the $L^1$-energy of maps from
$(S,h)$ to $(S,h')$.
  The study of $L^p$-type energies had been suggested by Thurston, in contrast
with the well-studied Lipschitz distance. A corollary of our result shows that
the volume of maximal globally hyperbolic Anti-de Sitter manifolds is bounded
from above by the exponential of (any of the two) Thurston's Lipschitz
asymmetric distances, up to some explicit constants. Although there is no such
bound from below, we provide examples in which this behavior is actually
realized. We prove instead that the volume is bounded from below by the
exponential of the Weil-Petersson distance.
  The proof of the main result uses more precise estimates on the behavior of
the volume, which is proved to be coarsely equivalent to the length of the
(left or right) measured geodesic lamination of earthquake from $(S,h)$ to

the southeastern end of the LMC, which hosts the young massive cluster R136 and
$\sim$400 O/WR stars (Doran et al. 2013) including the progenitor of SN1987A.
The collision is possibly evidenced by bridge features connecting the two HI
components and complementary distributions between them. We frame a hypothesis
that the collision triggered the formation of R136 and the surrounding
high-mass stars as well as the HI & Molecular Ridge. Fujimoto & Noguchi (1990)
advocated that the last tidal interaction between the LMC and the SMC about 0.2
Gyr ago induced collision of the L- and D-components. This model is consistent
with numerical simulations (Bekki & Chiba 2007b). We suggest that a dense HI
partly CO cloud of 10$^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$, a precursor of R136, was formed at the
shock-compressed interface between the colliding L- and D-components. We
suggest that part of the low-metalicity gas from the SMC was mixed in the tidal
interaction based on the $Planck/IRAS$ data of dust optical depth (Planck

when combined with equal temperaments. Fractals and the golden ratio appear
surprisingly on the way. The sequence of physical harmonics is an increasingly
enumerable submonoid of (R+,+) whose pairs of consecutive terms get arbitrarily
close as they grow. These properties suggest the definition of a new
mathematical object which we denote a tempered monoid. Mapping the elements of
the tempered monoid of physical harmonics from R to N may be considered
tantamount to defining equal temperaments. The number of equal parts of the
octave in an equal temperament corresponds to the multiplicity of the related
numerical semigroup. Analyzing the sequence of musical harmonics we derive two
important properties that tempered monoids may have: that of being
product-compatible and that of being fractal. We demonstrate that, up to
normalization, there is only one product-compatible tempered monoid, which is
the logarithmic monoid, and there is only one nonbisectional fractal monoid
which is generated by the golden ratio. The example of half-closed cylindrical
pipes imposes a third property to the sequence of musical harmonics, the
so-called odd-filterability property. We prove that the maximum number of equal
divisions of the octave such that the discretizations of the golden fractal
monoid and the logarithmic monoid coincide, and such that the discretization is
odd-filterable is 12. This is nothing else but the number of equal divisions of
the octave in classical Western music.

(RO-based) Vernier TDC using carry chains was reported by our team. The method
is very promising due to its low linearity error and low resource cost.
However, the implementation complexity is rather high especially when moving to
multi-channels TDC designs, since this method calls for a manual intervention
to the initial fitting results of the compilation software. In this paper, we
elaborate the key points toward implementing high performance multi-channels
TDCs of this kind while keeping the least implementation complexity.
Furthermore, we propose an efficient fine time interpolator construction method
called the period difference recording which only needs at most 31 adjustment
trials to obtain a targeted TDC resolution. To validate the techniques proposed
in this paper, we built a 32-channels TDC on a Stratix III FPGA chip and fully
evaluated its performance. Code density tests show that the obtained resolution
results lie in the range of (23 ps ~ 37 ps), the differential nonlinearity

Due to imperfect knowledge about the agent's behavior and the environment, it
is often the case that there are multiple hypotheses about an agent's plans
that are consistent with the observations, though only one of these hypotheses
is correct. This paper addresses the problem of how to disambiguate between
hypotheses, by querying the acting agent about whether a candidate plan in one
of the hypotheses matches its intentions. This process is performed
sequentially and used to update the set of possible hypotheses during the
recognition process. The paper defines the sequential plan recognition process
(SPRP), which seeks to reduce the number of hypotheses using a minimal number
of queries. We propose a number of policies for the SPRP which use maximum
likelihood and information gain to choose which plan to query. We show this
approach works well in practice on two domains from the literature,
significantly reducing the number of hypotheses using fewer queries than a

overall good fit to this important statistical descriptor of the galaxy

made a systematic study of this function applied to several samples drawn from
the SDSS. We show the effective ways to deal with incompleteness of the sample

estimate the errors in the calculation. We test four different distribution
functions to find the best fit: the Gravitational Quasi-Equilibrium
distribution, the Negative Binomial Distribution, the Log Normal distribution
and the Log Normal Distribution including a bias parameter. In the two latter
cases, we apply a shot-noise correction to the distributions assuming the local
Poisson model. We show that the best fit for the Counts-in-Cells distribution
function is provided by the Negative Binomial distribution. In addition, at
large scales the Log Normal distribution modified with the inclusion of the
bias term also performs a satisfactory fit of the empirical values of $f_V(N)$.
Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of a bias term in the Log Normal

experiencing an aspherical collapse. Here we review micro-jets of different
origins, scales and appearances, and propose a unified framework to describe
their dynamics by using an anisotropy parameter $\zeta$, representing a
dimensionless measure of the liquid momentum at the collapse point (Kelvin
impulse). This parameter is rigorously defined for various jet drivers,
including gravity and nearby boundaries. Combining theoretical considerations
with hundreds of high-speed visualisations of bubbles collapsing near a rigid
surface, near a free surface or in variable gravity, we classify the jets into
three distinct regimes: weak, intermediate and strong. Weak jets
($\zeta<10^{-3}$) hardly pierce the bubble, but remain within it throughout the
collapse and rebound. Intermediate jets ($10^{-3}<\zeta<0.1$) pierce the
opposite bubble wall close to the last collapse phase and clearly emerge during
the rebound. Strong jets ($\zeta>0.1$) pierce the bubble early during the
collapse. The dynamics of the jets is analysed through key observables, such as
the jet impact time, jet speed, bubble displacement, bubble volume at jet
impact and vapour-jet volume. We find that, upon normalising these observables
to dimensionless jet parameters, they all reduce to straightforward functions
of $\zeta$, which we can reproduce numerically using potential flow theory. An
interesting consequence of this result is that a measurement of a single
observable, such as the bubble displacement, suffices to estimate any other
parameter, such as the jet speed. Remarkably, the dimensionless parameters of
intermediate and weak jets only depend on $\zeta$, not on the jet driver. In
the same regime, the jet parameters are found to be well approximated by
power-laws of $\zeta$, which we explain through analytical arguments.

take a forward modelling approach and compare our models to the observed
spatial distribution of emission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading
effects of seeing and spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not
limited to particular emission lines or instruments. We test the model through
comparison to synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby
galaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the model
to real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our testing we show
that the inferred metallicity gradients and central metallicities are fairly
insensitive to the assumptions made in the model and that they are reliably
recovered for galaxies with sizes approximately equal to the half width at half
maximum of the point-spread function. However, we also find that the presence
of star forming clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of
metallicity gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore
we emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved
observations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved galaxies.

a list of recommended items for an active user based on the ratings of similar
users. This paper presents a novel approach to CF by first finding the set of
users similar to the active user by adopting self-organizing maps (SOM),
followed by k-means clustering. Then, the ratings for each item in the cluster
closest to the active user are mapped to the frequency domain using the
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The power spectra of the mapped ratings are
generated, and a new similarity measure based on the coherence of these power
spectra is calculated. The proposed similarity measure is more time efficient
than current state-of-the-art measures. Moreover, it can capture the global
similarity between the profiles of users. Experimental results show that the
proposed approach overcomes the major problems in existing CF algorithms as
follows: First, it mitigates the scalability problem by creating clusters of
similar users and applying the time-efficient similarity measure. Second, its
frequency-based similarity measure is less sensitive to sparsity problems
because the DFT performs efficiently even with sparse data. Third, it
outperforms standard similarity measures in terms of accuracy.

an enhancement in power conversion efficiency to the increased lifetime of the
photo-excited excitons. Essentially, a Ho3+ ion accelerates the phenomenon of
the spin rephasing or the intersystem crossing of the excitons in a
photosensitizer. Increase in the absorbance and decrease in the
photoluminescence intensity suggests a decrease in the recombination rate,
hinting an enhanced charge transport and is in accordance with our
electrochemical impedance spectra and the J V characteristics. From the above
we strongly believe that enhanced efficiency of the device is due to increased
intersystem crossing which would accelerate the exciton dissociation. On top of
spin orbit interaction, a configuration where the electric and magnetic fields
are perpendicular to each other helped in enhancing the efficiency by 16
percent, suggesting that the Lorentz force also plays a dominant role in
controlling the charge transport of the photo-generated charge carriers. We
strongly believe that this simple and novel strategy of improving the
efficiency may pave the way for realizing higher efficiency dye sensitized

Einstein-Cartan-fermion system, and find that its explicit expression is
formally independent of the coupling constant between torsion and axial
current. This seemingly topological nature is unexpected and is reminiscent of
similar nature of quantum Hall effect and topological insulator. However, the
coupling dependence does enter when evaluating it on-shell, and thus the
topological nature is pseudo. Based on the expression of the quasi-local
energy, we evaluate it for a particular solution on the entanglement wedge and
find the agreement with the holographic relative entropy obtained before. This
shows that the equivalence of these two quantities in the
Einstein-Cartan-fermion system. Moreover, the quasi-local energy in this case
is not always positive definite so that it provides an example of swampland in
torsion gravity. Based on the covariant Noether charge, we also derive the
nonzero fermion effect on Komar angular momentum. The implication of our
results to the tests of torsion gravity in the future gravitational wave
astronomy is also discussed.

cardiac devices through closed loop validation. To communicate with a virtual
heart, devices have been driven by cardiac signals at specific sites. As a
result, only the action potentials of these sites are sensed. However, the real
device implanted in the heart will sense a complex combination of near and
far-field extracellular potential signals. Therefore many device functions,
such as blanking periods and refractory periods, are designed to handle these
unexpected signals. To represent these signals, we develop an intracardiac
electrogram (IEGM) model as an interface between the virtual heart and the
device. The model can capture not only the local excitation but also far-field
signals and pacing afterpotentials. Moreover, the sensing controller can
specify unipolar or bipolar electrogram (EGM) sensing configurations and
introduce various oversensing and undersensing modes. The simulation results
show that the model is able to reproduce clinically observed sensing problems,
which significantly extends the capabilities of the virtual heart model in the

however, this approach often requires inextricable fabrication processes.
Alternatively, it is intriguing to explore methods to control transport

challenging because of the ubiquitous presence of adsorbents, which can lead to
charged-impurity scattering sites, charge traps, and recombination centers.
Here, we show that the short-circuit photocurrent originated from the built-in

attributed to the characteristic of the diffusion current that is associated
with the gradient of carrier density. Conversely, the photocurrent with bias
exhibits typical persistent photoconductivity and greatly depends on the
gaseous environment. The observation of environment-insensitive short-circuit

propagation. These phases, in turn, are due to the varying optical path length
seen by light at different transverse positions relative to the lens centre. A
similar lensing behavior can however be obtained when the optical phases are
introduced by an entirely different mechanism. Here, we consider the ""geometric
phases"" that arise from the polarization transformations occurring in
anisotropic optical media, named after Pancharatnam and Berry. The medium
anisotropy axis is taken to be space-variant in the transverse plane and the
resulting varying geometric phases give rise to the wavefront reshaping and
lensing effect, which however depends also on the input polarization. We
describe the realization and characterization of a cylindrical geometric-phase
lens that is converging for a given input circular polarization state and
diverging for the orthogonal one, which provides one of the simplest possible
examples of optical element based on geometric phases. The demonstrated lens is
flat and only few microns thick (not including the supporting substrates);
moreover, its working wavelength can be tuned and the lensing can be switched

one of the powerful ways to reduce the scan time of MR imaging with performance
guarantee. However, the computational costs are usually expensive. This paper
aims to propose a computationally fast and accurate deep learning algorithm for
the reconstruction of MR images from highly down-sampled k-space data.
  Theory: Based on the topological analysis, we show that the data manifold of
the aliasing artifact is easier to learn from a uniform subsampling pattern
with additional low-frequency k-space data. Thus, we develop deep aliasing
artifact learning networks for the magnitude and phase images to estimate and
remove the aliasing artifacts from highly accelerated MR acquisition.
  Methods: The aliasing artifacts are directly estimated from the distorted
magnitude and phase images reconstructed from subsampled k-space data so that
we can get an aliasing-free images by subtracting the estimated aliasing
artifact from corrupted inputs. Moreover, to deal with the globally distributed
aliasing artifact, we develop a multi-scale deep neural network with a large
receptive field.
  Results: The experimental results confirm that the proposed deep artifact
learning network effectively estimates and removes the aliasing artifacts.
Compared to existing CS methods from single and multi-coli data, the proposed
network shows minimal errors by removing the coherent aliasing artifacts.
Furthermore, the computational time is by order of magnitude faster.
  Conclusion: As the proposed deep artifact learning network immediately
generates accurate reconstruction, it has great potential for clinical
applications.

group activity selection problems on social networks (gGASP): a group of
players can engage in the same activity if the members of the group form a
connected subset of the underlying communication structure. Igarashi et al.
have primarily focused on Nash stable outcomes, and showed that many associated
algorithmic questions are computationally hard even for very simple networks.
In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of gGASP with respect to
the number of activities as well as with respect to the number of players, for
several solution concepts such as Nash stability, individual stability and core
stability. The first parameter we consider in the number of activities. For
this parameter, we propose an FPT algorithm for Nash stability for the case
where the social network is acyclic and obtain a W[1]-hardness result for
cliques (i.e., for classic GASP); similar results hold for individual
stability. In contrast, finding a core stable outcome is hard even if the
number of activities is bounded by a small constant, both for classic GASP and
when the social network is a star. Another parameter we study is the number of
players. While all solution concepts we consider become polynomial-time
computable when this parameter is bounded by a constant, we prove W[1]-hardness
results for cliques (i.e., for classic GASP).

multiscale (or compound) asymptotics, the "" functional analytic approach "" of
Lanza de Cristoforis (Analysis 28, 2008) allows to prove convergence of
expansions around interior small holes of size $\epsilon$ for solutions of
elliptic boundary value problems. Using the method of layer potentials, the
asymptotic behavior of the solution as $\epsilon$ tends to zero is described
not only by asymptotic series in powers of $\epsilon$, but by convergent power
series. Here we use this method to investigate the Dirichlet problem for the
Laplace operator where holes are collapsing at a polygonal corner of opening
$\omega$. Then in addition to the scale $\epsilon$ there appears the scale
$\eta = \epsilon^{\pi/\omega}$. We prove that when $\pi/\omega$ is irrational,
the solution of the Dirichlet problem is given by convergent series in powers
of these two small parameters. Due to interference of the two scales, this
convergence is obtained, in full generality, by grouping together integer
powers of the two scales that are very close to each other. Nevertheless, there
exists a dense subset of openings $\omega$ (characterized by Diophantine
approximation properties), for which real analyticity in the two variables
$\epsilon$ and $\eta$ holds and the power series converge unconditionally. When
$\pi/\omega$ is rational, the series are unconditionally convergent, but
contain terms in log $\epsilon$.

the development of dissolution-driven convection in partially miscible
stratifications, when they impact the density profile in the host fluid phase.
We numerically analyze the dynamics of this reactive convective dissolution in
the fully developed non-linear regime for a phase A dissolving into a host
layer containing a dissolved reactant B. We show that for a general
A+B$\rightarrow$C reaction in solution, the dynamics vary with the Rayleigh
numbers of the chemical species, i.e. with the nature of the chemicals in the
host phase. Depending on whether the reaction slows down, accelerates or is at
the origin of the development of convection, the spatial distributions of
species A, B or C, the dissolution flux and the reaction rate are different. We
show that chemical reactions enhance the steady-state flux as they consume A
and can induce more intense convection than in the absence of reactions. This
result is important in the context of CO$_2$ geological sequestration where
quantifying the storage rate of CO$_2$ dissolving into the host oil or aqueous
phase is crucial to assess the efficiency and the safety of the project.

we show that the following three problems are equivalent: (i) determining a
finite Blaschke product from its critical points, (ii) finding the equilibrium
position of moveable point charges interacting with a special configuration of
fixed charges, (iii) solving a moment problem for the canonical representation
of power moments on the real axis. These equivalences are not only of
theoretical interest, but also open up new perspectives for the design of
algorithms. For instance, the second problem is closely linked to the
determination of certain Stieltjes and Van Vleck polynomials for a second order

a deep net is capable of generating a descriptive language of unprecedented

within a trained CNN model (in the case of image data), and reusing it for
other purposes is a field of interest, as it provides access to the visual
descriptors previously learnt by the CNN after processing millions of images,
without requiring an expensive training phase. Contributions to this field
(commonly known as feature representation transfer or transfer learning) have
been purely empirical so far, extracting all CNN features from a single layer
close to the output and testing their performance by feeding them to a
classifier. This approach has provided consistent results, although its
relevance is limited to classification tasks. In a completely different
approach, in this paper we statistically measure the discriminative power of
every single feature found within a deep CNN, when used for characterizing
every class of 11 datasets. We seek to provide new insights into the behavior
of CNN features, particularly the ones from convolutional layers, as this can
be relevant for their application to knowledge representation and reasoning.
Our results confirm that low and middle level features may behave differently
to high level features, but only under certain conditions. We find that all CNN
features can be used for knowledge representation purposes both by their
presence or by their absence, doubling the information a single CNN feature may
provide. We also study how much noise these features may include, and propose a
thresholding approach to discard most of it. All these insights have a direct
application to the generation of CNN embedding spaces.

Solution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides
the position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated
using Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. Aims. We
investigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by
means of the astrometric data for open clusters. Methods. Mean cluster parallax
and proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations
within the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the
internal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects
of the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of
the TGAS data is assessed. Results. Values given for standard uncertainties are
still inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of
least squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster
parallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with
earlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the
Pleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that
discrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the
cluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether
those potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the
clusters. Conclusions. The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters
far beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership
assessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows
the same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly
increased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.

solution, which is proven to be unique. Second, we establish uniform (with
respect to the size of the meshes and the time step) L2 -bounds for the space
and time translates; this proves, by the Kolmogorov theorem, the relative
compactness of any sequence of solutions obtained through a sequence of
discretizations the time and space steps of which tend to zero; the limits of
converging subsequences are then shown to be a solution to the continuous
problem. Estimates of time translates of the discrete solutions are obtained
through the formalization of a generic argument, interesting for its own sake.

  Resonance in Medicine",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The radial k-space trajectory is a well-established sampling
trajectory used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging. However, the
radial k-space trajectory requires a large number of radial lines for
high-resolution reconstruction. Increasing the number of radial lines causes
longer acquisition time, making it more difficult for routine clinical use. On
the other hand, if we reduce the number of radial lines, streaking artifact
patterns are unavoidable. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep
learning approach with domain adaptation to restore high-resolution MR images
from under-sampled k-space data.
  Methods: The proposed deep network removes the streaking artifacts from the
artifact corrupted images. To address the situation given the limited available
data, we propose a domain adaptation scheme that employs a pre-trained network
using a large number of x-ray computed tomography (CT) or synthesized radial MR
datasets, which is then fine-tuned with only a few radial MR datasets.
  Results: The proposed method outperforms existing compressed sensing
algorithms, such as the total variation and PR-FOCUSS methods. In addition, the
calculation time is several orders of magnitude faster than the total variation
and PR-FOCUSS methods.Moreover, we found that pre-training using CT or MR data
from similar organ data is more important than pre-training using data from the
same modality for different organ.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate the possibility of a domain-adaptation when only a
limited amount of MR data is available. The proposed method surpasses the
existing compressed sensing algorithms in terms of the image quality and
computation time.

interest in sequence learning, for which a basic problem is how to measure the
distance between sequences. Dynamic time warping (DTW) aligns two sequences by
nonlinear local warping and returns a distance value. DTW shows superior
ability in many applications, e.g. video, image, etc. However, in DTW, two
points are paired essentially based on point-to-point Euclidean distance (ED)
without considering the autocorrelation of sequences. Thus, points with
different semantic meanings, e.g. peaks and valleys, may be matched providing
their coordinate values are similar. As a result, DTW is sensitive to noise and
poorly interpretable. This paper proposes an efficient and flexible sequence
alignment algorithm, dynamic state warping (DSW). DSW converts each time point
into a latent state, which endows point-wise autocorrelation information.
Alignment is performed by using the state sequences. Thus DSW is able to yield
alignment that is semantically more interpretable than that of DTW. Using one
nearest neighbor classifier, DSW shows significant improvement on
classification accuracy in comparison to ED (70/85 wins) and DTW (74/85 wins).
We also empirically demonstrate that DSW is more robust and scales better to
long sequences than ED and DTW.

the on-site Coulomb interaction by less that a factor of two. Finally, we
calculate the full plasmon spectrum of few-layer BP and discuss the effects

destruction-free investigation of nanostructured surfaces. However, due to the
shallow incidence angles, the footprint of the X-ray beam is significantly
elongated, limiting GISAXS to samples with typical target lengths of several
millimetres. For many potential applications, the production of large target
areas is impractical, and the targets are surrounded by structured areas.
Because the beam footprint is larger than the targets, the surrounding
structures contribute parasitic scattering, burying the target signal. In this
paper, GISAXS measurements of isolated as well as surrounded grating targets in
Si substrates with line lengths from $50\,{\rm\mu m}$ down to $4\,{\rm\mu m}$
are presented. For the isolated grating targets, the changes in the scattering
patterns due to the reduced target length are explained. For the surrounded
grating targets, the scattering signal of a $15\,{\rm\mu

scattering signal of $100\,{\rm\mu m}\,\times\,100\,{\rm\mu m}$ nanostructured
surroundings by producing the target with a different orientation with respect
to the predominant direction of the surrounding structures. The described
technique allows to apply GISAXS, e.g. for characterization of metrology fields

was discovered in the structure search. The stability of bistable P42/nnm
ZrH1.5 structures and I4/mmm ZrH2 structures are also revisited. We find that
the P42/nnm (c/a > 1) ZrH1.5 is dynamically unstable, while the I4/mmm (c/a =
1.57) ZrH2 is dynamically stable.The P42/nnm (c/a < 1) ZrH1.5 might be a key
intermediate phase for the transition of {\gamma}->{\delta}->{\epsilon} phases.
Additionally, by using the thermal dynamic simulations, we find that
{\delta}-ZrH1.5 is the most stable structure at high temperature while ZrH2 is
the most stable hydride at low temperature. Slow cooling process will promote
the formation of {\delta}-ZrH1.5, and fast cooling process will promote the
formation of {\gamma}-ZrH. These results may help to understand the phase
transitions of zirconium hydrides.

The first defines global dynamics of the closure defect of the surface, with
two basic toy-models, either a dissipative dynamics relaxing towards the
closure constraint or a Hamiltonian dynamics precessing the closure defect. The
second class of dynamics describes the isolated regime, when both area and
closure defect are conserved throughout the evolution. The surface dynamics is
implemented through U(N) transformations and generalizes to a Bose-Hubbard

a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks Lorentz
invariance. They provide an alternative way of exploring the similarities
between theories with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and gauge theories.
The equivalence between bumblebee models with suitable conditions and standard
electrodynamics in a non-linear gauge $A_\mu A^\mu-b^2=0$ is taken for granted;
however, this point is very subtle and has not yet been fully addressed. The
main goal of this paper is to fill in this gap. More precisely, here we study
the relation between a bumblebee model, with a smooth potential of the form
$V(B _{\mu}) = V (B _{\mu} B ^{\mu} - b ^{2})$, and standard electrodynamics in
the non-linear gauge $A _{\mu} A ^{\mu} - b ^{2} = 0$, both at the classical
and quantum levels. Using the Dirac's method we show that after introducing
Dirac brackets with suitable initial conditions, the classical dynamics of the
bumblebee model corresponds to that of standard electrodynamics in the
aforementioned non-linear gauge. In the quantum case we demonstrate that
perturbative calculations of Feynman amplitudes to any physical process in each
model are indistinguishable. To do this, we show that the Feynman rules and
propagators of standard electrodynamics in the non-linear gauge and those
describing the bumblebee model are the same.

viscoelasticity, which is a system coupling a Navier-Stokes equation with a
transport equation for the deformation tensor. The existence of global smooth
solutions near the equilibrium with a fixed positive viscosity was known since
the work of F. H. Lin, C. Liu, and P. Zhang in ""On hydrodynamics of
viscoelastic fluids"". The inviscid case was solved recently by the second
author Z. Lei. in ""Global well-posedness of incompressible elastodynamics in
two dimensions"". While the latter was solely based on the techniques from the
studies of hyperbolic equations, and hence the 2D problem is in general more
challenge than that in higher dimensions, the former was relied crucially upon
a dissipative mechanism. Indeed, after a symmetrization and a linearization
around the equilibrium, the system of the incompressible viscoelasticity
reduces to an incompressible system of damped wave equations for both the fluid
velocity and the deformation tensor. These two approaches are not compatible.
In this paper, we prove global existence of solutions, uniformly in both time
$t \in [0, \infty)$ and viscosity $\mu \geq 0$. This allows us to justify in
particular the vanishing viscosity limit for all time. In order to overcome
difficulties coming from the incompatibility between the purely hyperbolic
limiting system and the systems with additional parabolic viscous
perturbations, we introduce in this paper a rather robust method which may
apply to a wide class of physical systems of similar nature. Roughly speaking,
the method works in two dimensional case whenever the hyperbolic system
satisfies intrinsically a ""Strong Null Condition"". For dimensions not less than
three, the usual null condition is sufficient for this method to work.

model after accounting for the clustering bias of the 2MRS galaxies. We also
quantify the polar and azimuthal anisotropies and identify two directions
$(l,b)=(150^{\circ}, -15^{\circ})$, $(l,b)=(310^{\circ},-15^{\circ})$ which are
significantly anisotropic compared to the other directions in the sky. We
suggest that their preferential orientations on the sky may indicate a possible
alignment of the Local Group with two nearby large scale structures. Despite
the differences in the degree of anisotropy on small scales, we find that the
galaxy distributions in both the 2MRS and the $\Lambda$CDM model are isotropic
on a scale of $90 \, h^{-1}\, {\rm Mpc}$.

The
fast cooling electrons behind the shocks can generate a position-dependent
inhomogeneous electron distribution if they do not have enough time to mix
homogeneously. This would lead to a very different synchrotron spectrum in
low-frequency bands to that in the homogeneous case due to the synchrotron
absorption. In this paper, we calculate the synchrotron spectrum in the
inhomogeneous case in a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Both the forward shock and the
reverse shock are considered. We find for the reverse shock dominated case, we
would expect a ""reverse shock bump"" in the low-frequency spectrum. The spectral
bump is due to the combination synchrotron absorption in both the forward and
reverse shock regions. In the forward shock spectrum in the low frequencies has
two unconventional segments with spectral slopes of $\lesssim1$ and $11/8$. The
slope of $11/8$ has been found by some authors, while the slope of $\lesssim1$
is new, which is due to the approximately constant electron temperature in the
optically thick region. In the future, simultaneous observations in multiple
bands (especially in the low frequency bands) in the GRB early afterglow or
prompt emission phases will possibly reveal these spectral characteristics and
enable us to identify the reverse shock component and distinguish between the
forward and reverse shock emissions. This also may be a method with which to
diagnose the electron distribution status (homogeneous or inhomogeneous) after
fast cooling in the relativistic shock region.

be quite good for moderate values of the momentum transfer $q\gtrsim k_F$. The
second approximation involves using in the ""frozen"" meson-exchange currents

resulting ""frozen nucleon approximation"", the inclusive 2p-2h responses are
accurately calculated with only a one-dimensional integral over the emission

for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. It is generally accepted
that this is due to the large value of the eccentricity of its orbit. However,
the mathematical model originally introduced to study its spin-orbit evolution
proved not to be entirely convincing, because of the expression commonly used
for the tidal torque. Only recently, in a series of papers mainly by Efroimsky
and Makarov, a different model for the tidal torque has been proposed, which
has the advantages of being more realistic, and of providing a higher
probability of capture in the 3:2 resonance with respect to the previous
models. On the other hand, a drawback of the model is that the function
describing the tidal torque is not smooth and consists of a superposition of
kinks, so that both analytical and numerical computations turn out to be rather
delicate: indeed, standard perturbation theory based on power series expansion
cannot be applied and the implementation of a fast algorithm to integrate the
equations of motion numerically requires a high degree of care. In this paper,
we make a detailed study of the spin-orbit dynamics of Mercury, as predicted by
the realistic model: In particular, we present numerical and analytical results
about the nature of the librations of Mercury's spin in the 3:2 resonance. The
results provide evidence that the librations are quasi-periodic in time.

The temperature evolution of the BO order parameters was analyzed on the basis
of the multicritical scaling theory (MCST). Our results confirmed the validity
of the MCST in the whole temperature range of existence of the hexatic phase

We found that the temperature dependence of higher order harmonics of the BO

experienced strong radiative cooling resulting in post-shock compressions of {

Presburger arithmetic, is decidable in double exponential time. Adding an
uninterpreted unary predicate to the language leads to an undecidable theory.
We sharpen the known boundary between decidable and undecidable in that we show
that the purely universal fragment of the extended theory is already
undecidable. Our proof is based on a reduction of the halting problem for
two-counter machines to unsatisfiability of sentences in the extended language
of Presburger arithmetic that does not use existential quantification. On the
other hand, we argue that a single $\forall\exists$ quantifier alternation
turns the set of satisfiable sentences of the extended language into a
$\Sigma^1_1$-complete set. Some of the mentioned results can be transfered to
the realm of linear arithmetic over the ordered real numbers. This concerns the
undecidability of the purely universal fragment and the $\Sigma^1_1$-hardness
for sentences with at least one quantifier alternation. Finally, we discuss the
relevance of our results to verification. In particular, we derive
undecidability results for quantified fragments of separation logic, the theory
of arrays, and combinations of the theory of equality over uninterpreted

Wall (EW) problem has to be resolved. It is caused by an exponential increase
of the number of configurations with increasing electron number N. There are
different routes one may follow. One is to characterize a many-electron
wavefunction by a vector in Liouville space with a cumulant metric rather than
in Hilbert space. This removes the EW problem. Another is to model the solid by
an {\it impurity} or {\it fragment} embedded in a {\it bath} which is treated
at a much lower level than the former. This is the case in Density Matrix
Embedding Theory (DMET) or Density Embedding Theory (DET). The latter are
closely related to a Schmidt decomposition of a system and to the determination
of the associated entanglement. We show here the connection between the two
approaches. It turns out that the DMET (or DET) has an identical active space

of the International Atomic Time (TAI), with stated accuracies of around
$3\times 10^{-16}$. They have also been the references for a number of absolute
measurements of clock transition frequencies in various optical frequency
standards in view of a future redefinition of the second. The phase coherent
optical frequency transfer via a stabilized telecom fiber link enables far
better resolution than any other means of frequency transfer based on satellite
links. The agreement for each pair of distant fountains compared is well within
the combined uncertainty of a few 10$^{-16}$ for all the comparisons, which
fully supports the stated PFSs' uncertainties. The comparison also includes a
rubidium fountain frequency standard participating in the steering of TAI and
enables a new absolute determination of the $^{87}$Rb ground state hyperfine
transition frequency with an uncertainty of $3.1\times 10^{-16}$.

enable them to achieve simple facts and figures. Furthermore, from the results

education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of
the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological
innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private
academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical
and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital
education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).
However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the
majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the
promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.)
that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and
research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise,
