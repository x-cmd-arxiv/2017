acid sequences, while their three-dimensional folded structure and their
biological function remain remarkably conserved. Thanks to modern sequencing
techniques, sequence data accumulate at unprecedented pace. This provides large
sets of so-called homologous, i.e.~evolutionarily related protein sequences, to
which methods of inverse statistical physics can be applied. Using sequence
data as the basis for the inference of Boltzmann distributions from samples of
microscopic configurations or observables, it is possible to extract
information about evolutionary constraints and thus protein function and
structure. Here we give an overview over some biologically important questions,
and how statistical-mechanics inspired modeling approaches can help to answer
them. Finally, we discuss some open questions, which we expect to be addressed
over the next years.

physiological conditions, intracellular mixtures can phase separate into
spatially distinct regions with differing compositions. In this paper we
present numerical evidence indicating that such spontaneous
compartmentalization exploits general features of the phase diagram of a
multicomponent biomolecular mixture. In particular, we show that demixed
domains are likely to segregate when the variance in the inter-molecular
interaction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold. Multiple distinct
phases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can
then be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor
adjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the
inter-molecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different
domains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust
mechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this
functionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in
the system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical
reasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of
demixing phase transitions.

smooth trajectories with relatively little demand on the vehicle dynamics to
ensure passenger comfort and driving safety. However, the occurrence of
unexpected events may require vehicles to perform aggressive maneuvers, near
the limits of their dynamic capacities. In order to ensure the occupant's
safety in these situations, the ability to plan controllable but near-limits
trajectories will be of very high importance. One of the main issues in
planning aggressive maneuvers lies in the high complexity of the vehicle
dynamics near the handling limits, which effectively makes state-of-the-art
methods such as Model Predictive Control difficult to use. This article studies
a highly precise model of the vehicle body to derive a simpler, constrained
second-order integrator dynamic model which remains precise even near the
handling limits of the vehicle. Preliminary simulation results indicate that
our model provides better accuracy without increasing computation time compared
to a more classical kinematic bicycle model. The proposed model can find
applications for contingency planning, which may require aggressive maneuvers,
or for trajectory planning at high speed, for instance in racing applications.

This scenario would call for a helicity-0 dominance, which were at odds with
the properties of a conventional tensor charmonium, but might be compatible
with some exotic structure of the $\chi_{c2}(3930)$. In this paper, we
investigate, if such a scenario is compatible with the assumption that the
$\chi_{c2}(3930)$ is a $D^*\bar D^*$ molecular state - a spin partner of the
$X(3872)$ treated as a shallow bound state. We demonstrate that for a tensor
molecule the helicity-0 component vanishes for vanishing binding energy and
accordingly for a shallow bound state a helicity-2 dominance would be natural.
However, for the $\chi_{c2}(3930)$, residing about 100 MeV below the $D^*\bar
D^*$ threshold, there is no a priori reason for a helicity-2 dominance and thus
the proposal formulated in the above mentioned reference might indeed point at
a molecular structure of the tensor state. Nevertheless, we find that the
experimental data currently available favour a dominant contribution of the
helicity-2 amplitude also in this scenario, if spin symmetry arguments are
employed to relate properties of the molecular state to those of the X(3872).

quantity is related to the fourth moment of the trace of the energy momentum
tensor correlator for theories which are conformal at both ends. Subtleties
arise for non-conformal fixed points as might be the case for infrared fixed

science, there is an increasing need to move to high accuracy schemes for
computational astrophysics. Hence the need for a specialized review on higher
order schemes for computational astrophysics.
  The focus here is on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes,
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and PNPM schemes. WENO schemes are higher
order extensions of traditional second order finite volume schemes which are
already familiar to most computational astrophysicists. DG schemes, on the
other hand, evolve all the moments of the solution, with the result that they
are more accurate than WENO schemes. PNPM schemes occupy a compromise position
between WENO and PNPM schemes. They evolve an Nth order spatial polynomial,
while reconstructing higher order terms up to Mth order. As a result, the
timestep can be larger.
  Time-dependent astrophysical codes need to be accurate in space and time.
This is realized with the help of SSP-RK (strong stability preserving
Runge-Kutta) schemes and ADER (Arbitrary DERivative in space and time) schemes.
The most popular approaches to SSP-RK and ADER schemes are also described.

of hyperbolic systems and one-dimensional Riemann solvers. Such an
understanding can be acquired from a sequence of prepackaged lectures available
from http://www.nd.edu/~dbalsara/Numerical-PDE-Course. We then build on this
understanding to give the reader a practical introduction to the schemes
described here. The emphasis is on computer-implementable ideas, not
necessarily on the underlying theory, because it was felt that this would be
most interesting to most computational astrophysicists.

studies which identify quasi-periodic variables using the false alarm

attractive alternative. Here, we investigate homo-oligomeric interfaces by
tracing residue coevolution via the global statistical Direct Coupling Analysis
(DCA). DCA can accurately infer spatial adjacencies between residues. These
adjacencies can be included as constraints in structure-prediction techniques
to predict high-resolution models. By taking advantage of the on-going
exponential growth of sequence databases, we go significantly beyond anecdotal
cases of a few protein families and apply DCA to a systematic large-scale study
of nearly 2000 PFAM protein families with sufficient sequence information and
structurally resolved homo-oligomeric interfaces. We find that large interfaces
are commonly identified by DCA. We further demonstrate that DCA can
differentiate between subfamilies of different binding modes within one large
PFAM family. Sequence derived contact information for the subfamilies proves
sufficient to assemble accurate structural models of the diverse
protein-oligomers. Thus, we provide an approach to investigate oligomerization
for arbitrary protein families leading to structural models complementary to
often difficult experimental methods. Combined with ever more abundant
sequential data, we anticipate that this study will be instrumental to allow
the structural description of many hetero-protein complexes in the future.

subtraction of inactive templates enabled us to measure the line fluxes for
several diagnostics of both chromospheric activity and accretion. We found that
all Class-III sources have H$\alpha$ fluxes compatible with a pure
chromospheric activity, while objects with disks lie mostly above the boundary
between chromospheres and accretion. YSOs with transitional disks displays both
high and low H$\alpha$ fluxes. We found that the line fluxes per unit surface
are tightly correlated with the accretion luminosity ($L_{\rm acc}$) derived
from the Balmer continuum excess. This rules out that the relationships between
$L_{\rm acc}$ and line luminosities found in previous works are simply due to
calibration effects. We also found that the CaII-IRT flux ratio,
$F_{8542}/F_{8498}$, is always small, indicating an optically thick emission
source. The latter can be identified with the accretion shock near the stellar
photosphere. The Balmer decrement reaches instead, for several accretors, high

select a state as an action at each time step to minimize the total expected
cost. The decision-maker is faced with asymmetries both in cost and
observation: in case the selected state is less than the actual state of the
Markovian process, an under-utilization cost occurs and only partial
observation about the actual state is revealed; otherwise, the decision incurs
an over-utilization cost and reveals full information about the actual state.
We can formulate this problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
which can be expressed as a dynamic program based on the last full observed
state and the time of full observation. This formulation determines the
sequence of actions to be taken between any two consecutive full observations
of the actual state. However, this DP grows exponentially in the number of
states, with little hope for a computationally feasible solution. We present an
interesting class of computationally tractable policies with a percentile
structure. A generalization of binary search, this class of policies attempt at
any given time to reduce the uncertainty by a given percentage. Among all
percentile policies, we search for the one with the minimum expected cost. The
result of this search is a heuristic policy which we evaluate through numerical
simulations. We show that it outperforms the myopic policies and under some
conditions performs close to the optimal policies. Furthermore, we derive a
lower bound on the cost of the optimal policy which can be computed with low
complexity and give a measure for how close our heuristic policy is to the
optimal policy.

an operationally motivated asymmetry quantifier in the resource theory of
asymmetry. We study the convexity and monotonicity properties of asymmetry
weight and focus on its interplay with the corresponding semidefinite

Since the SDP form of asymmetry weight is closely related to asymmetry

witnesses can be viewed as a special case of an asymmetry witness --- which
indicates a potential connection between asymmetry and entanglement. We also
provide an operationally meaningful coherence measure, which we term
$coherence~weight$, and investigate its relationship to other coherence
measures like the robustness of coherence and the $l_1$ norm of coherence. In
particular, we show that for Werner states in any dimension $d$, all three

representation of the nonrelativistic time-independent wave operator is
tridiagonal and symmetric. Consequently, the matrix wave equation becomes a
symmetric three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the
wavefunction in this basis. The recursion relation is then solved exactly in
terms of orthogonal polynomials in the energy. Some of these polynomials are
not found in the mathematics literature. The asymptotics of these polynomials
give the phase shift of the continuous energy scattering states and the
spectrum for the discrete energy bound states. Depending on the space and
boundary conditions, the basis functions are written in terms of either the
Laguerre or Jacobi polynomials. The tridiagonal requirement limits the number
of potential functions that yield exact solutions of the wave equation.
Nonetheless, the class of exactly solvable problems in this approach is larger

between the degrees-of-freedom of complex semi-autonomous systems and the

are required to close this gap and allow for better collaboration between
humans and machines on complex tasks. To better inform the design of concurrent

both control and feedback signals to interactively train an actor-critic

human delivered control signals, 2) reward-shaping feedback signals, and 3)
simultaneous control and feedback. Our results suggest that subjects provide
less feedback when simultaneously delivering feedback and control signals and
that control signal quality is not significantly diminished. Our data suggest
that subjects may also modify when and how they provide feedback. Through
algorithmic development and tuning informed by this study, we expect
semi-autonomous actions of robotic agents can be better shaped by human
feedback, allowing for seamless collaboration and improved performance in

propagation, and abrupt shifts where patches of vegetation vanish at once, are
a possibility in dryland ecosystems due to their emergent spatial
heterogeneity. However, recent theoretical work has suggested that the final
step of desertification - the transition from spotted vegetation to bare soil -
occurs only as an abrupt shift, but the generality of this result, and its
underlying origin, remain unclear. We investigate two models that detail the

detect how much she paid to any single project. Though it is still possible to
confidentially exchange any part of an investment between any pair of
investors, such that market liquidity is unaffected by the system. On top, our
framework allows a privacy-preserving return of a multiple of all the held
investments (e.g. interest payments or dividends) to the indivdual investors
while still revealing nothing else than the sum of all returns for every
investor. We provide reasonable security guarantees for this framework that are
based on common notions from the Secure Multi-Party Computation literature. As
instantiation for this framework we present Investcoin. It is a proper
combination of three cryptographic protocols, namely a Private Stream
Aggregation scheme, a Commitment scheme and a Range test and it is usable in
connection with any existing currency. The security of these protocols is based
on the DDH assumption. By a composition theorem from the SMPC literature, the
security of the resulting Investcoin protocol is also based on the DDH
assumption. Furthermore, we provide a simple decentralised key generation
protocol for Investcoin supporting dynamic join/leave and fault-tolarance of
investors and moreover achieves some security guarantees against malicious
investors.

introduce a two-layer erasure-coded fault-tolerant distributed storage system
offering atomic access for read and write operations. In edge computing,
clients interact with an edge-layer of servers that is geographically near; the
edge-layer in turn interacts with a back-end layer of servers. The edge-layer
provides low latency access and temporary storage for client operations, and
uses the back-end layer for persistent storage. Our algorithm, termed Layered
Data Storage (LDS) algorithm, offers several features suitable for
edge-computing systems, works under asynchronous message-passing environments,
supports multiple readers and writers, and can tolerate $f_1 < n_1/2$ and $f_2
< n_2/3$ crash failures in the two layers having $n_1$ and $n_2$ servers,
respectively. We use a class of erasure codes known as regenerating codes for
storage of data in the back-end layer. The choice of regenerating codes,
instead of popular choices like Reed-Solomon codes, not only optimizes the cost
of back-end storage, but also helps in optimizing communication cost of read
operations, when the value needs to be recreated all the way from the back-end.
The two-layer architecture permits a modular implementation of atomicity and
erasure-code protocols; the implementation of erasure-codes is mostly limited
to interaction between the two layers. We prove liveness and atomicity of LDS,
and also compute performance costs associated with read and write operations.
Further, in a multi-object system running $N$ independent instances of LDS,
where only a small fraction of the objects undergo concurrent accesses at any
point during the execution, the overall storage cost is dominated by that of
persistent storage in the back-end layer, and is given by $\Theta(N)$.

computer vision. The key problem is to simultaneously infer the exact object
locations in the training images and train the object detectors, given only the
training images with weak image-level labels. Intuitively, by simulating the
selective attention mechanism of human visual system, saliency detection
technique can select attractive objects in scenes and thus is a potential way
to provide useful priors for WOD. However, the way to adopt saliency detection
in WOD is not trivial since the detected saliency region might be possibly
highly ambiguous in complex cases. To this end, this paper first
comprehensively analyzes the challenges in applying saliency detection to WOD.
Then, we make one of the earliest efforts to bridge saliency detection to WOD
via the self-paced curriculum learning, which can guide the learning procedure
to gradually achieve faithful knowledge of multi-class objects from easy to
hard. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can
successfully bridge saliency detection and WOD tasks and achieve the
state-of-the-art object detection results under the weak supervision.

charged particles using storage rings, demand for an understanding of the spin
dynamics with unprecedented accuracy. The ultimate aim is to measure the
electric dipole moments with a sensitivity up to 15 orders in magnitude better
than the magnetic dipole moment of the stored particles. This formidable task
requires an understanding of the background to the signal of the electric
dipole from rotations of the spins in the spurious magnetic fields of a storage
ring. One of the observables, especially sensitive to the imperfection magnetic
fields in the ring is the angular orientation of stable spin axis. Up to now,
the stable spin axis has never been determined experimentally, and in addition,
the JEDI collaboration for the first time succeeded to quantify the background
signals that stem from false rotations of the magnetic dipole moments in the
horizontal and longitudinal imperfection magnetic fields of the storage ring.
To this end, we developed a new method based on the spin tune response of a
machine to artificially applied longitudinal magnetic fields. This novel
technique, called \textit{spin tune mapping}, emerges as a very powerful tool
to probe the spin dynamics in storage rings. The technique was experimentally
tested in 2014 at the cooler synchrotron COSY, and for the first time, the
angular orientation of the stable spin axis at two different locations in the
ring has been determined to an unprecedented accuracy of better than
$2.8\mu$rad.

is well fitted with a $t^{-5/3}$ decay, and we constrain the rise-time to peak
to be $<$49 rest-frame days after disruption, which is roughly consistent with
the fallback timescale expected for the $\sim 5\times$10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$ black
hole inferred from the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. The UV
and optical spectral energy distribution (SED) is well described by a constant
blackbody temperature of T$\sim$ 3$\times$10$^4$ K over the monitoring period,
with an observed peak luminosity of 1.1$\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The
optical spectra are characterized by a strong blue continuum and broad HeII and
H$\alpha$ lines characteristic of TDEs. We compare the photometric and
spectroscopic signatures of iPTF16axa with 11 TDE candidates in the literature
with well-sampled optical light curves. Based on a single-temperature fit to
the optical and near-UV photometry, most of these TDE candidates have peak
luminosities confined between log(L [erg s$^{-1}$]) = 43.4-44.4, with constant
temperatures of a few $\times 10^{4}$ K during their power-law declines,
implying blackbody radii on the order of ten times the tidal disruption radius,
that decrease monotonically with time. For TDE candidates with hydrogen and
helium emission, the high helium-to-hydrogen ratios suggest that the emission
arises from high-density gas, where nebular arguments break down. We find no
correlation between the peak luminosity and the black hole mass, contrary to
the expectations for TDEs to have $\dot{M} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$.

section condition also generalises the one known from exceptional field theory.
Even with the section condition, the E11 duality equation for gravity is known
to miss the trace component of the spin connection. We propose an extended
scheme based on an infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra, called the tensor
hierarchy algebra, that incorporates the section condition and resolves the
above issue. The tensor hierarchy algebra defines a generalised differential

bonus for a DQN agent and combined with a mixed Monte Carlo update was
sufficient to achieve state of the art on the Atari 2600 game Montezuma's

requiring no special apparatus. We combine PixelCNN pseudo-counts with
different agent architectures to dramatically improve the state of the art on

which is insufficient to support (critical) applications that need to be
deployed across multiple trust domains, while enforcing diverse security
requirements. This paper addresses this limitation by presenting a novel
solution for the central resource allocation problem of network virtualization
-- the virtual network embedding, which aims to find efficient mappings of
virtual network requests onto the substrate network. We improve over the
state-of-the-art by considering security as a first-class citizen of virtual
networks, while enhancing the substrate infrastructure with resources from
multiple cloud providers. Our solution enables the definition of flexible
policies in three core elements: on the virtual links, where alternative
security compromises can be explored (e.g., encryption); on the virtual
switches, supporting various degrees of protection and redundancy if necessary;
and on the substrate infrastructure, extending it across multiple clouds,
including public and private facilities, with their inherently diverse trust
levels associated. We propose an optimal solution to this problem formulated as
a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The results of our evaluation give
insight into the trade-offs associated with the inclusion of security demands
into network virtualization. In particular, they provide evidence that
enhancing the user's virtual networks with security does not preclude high
acceptance rates and an efficient use of resources, and allows providers to
increase their revenues.

algorithms has been a longstanding goal in reinforcement learning. As a primary
example, TD($\lambda$) elegantly unifies one-step TD prediction with Monte
Carlo methods through the use of eligibility traces and the trace-decay
parameter $\lambda$. Currently, there are a multitude of algorithms that can be
used to perform TD control, including Sarsa, $Q$-learning, and Expected Sarsa.
These methods are often studied in the one-step case, but they can be extended
across multiple time steps to achieve better performance. Each of these
algorithms is seemingly distinct, and no one dominates the others for all
problems. In this paper, we study a new multi-step action-value algorithm
called $Q(\sigma)$ which unifies and generalizes these existing algorithms,
while subsuming them as special cases. A new parameter, $\sigma$, is introduced
to allow the degree of sampling performed by the algorithm at each step during
its backup to be continuously varied, with Sarsa existing at one extreme (full
sampling), and Expected Sarsa existing at the other (pure expectation).
$Q(\sigma)$ is generally applicable to both on- and off-policy learning, but in
this work we focus on experiments in the on-policy case. Our results show that
an intermediate value of $\sigma$, which results in a mixture of the existing
algorithms, performs better than either extreme. The mixture can also be varied
dynamically which can result in even greater performance.

(RBC) into rouleaux, which are responsible for the pronounced shear thinning
behavior of blood, control the erythro- cyte sedimentation rate (ESR) a common
hematological test and are involved in many situations of physiological
relevance such as structuration of blood in the microcirculation or clot
formation in pathological situations. Confocal microscopy is used to
characterize the shape of RBCs within rouleaux at equilibrium as a function of
macromolecular concentration, revealing the diversity of contact zone
morphology. Three different configurations that have only been partly predicted
before are identified, namely parachute, male-female and sigmoid shapes, and
quantitatively recovered by numerical simulations. A detailed experimental and
theoretical analysis of clusters of two cells shows that the deformation
increases nonlinearly with the interaction energy. Models indicate a forward
bifurcation in which the contacting membrane undergoes a buckling instability
from a flat to a de- formed contact zone at a critical value of the interaction
energy. These results are not only relevant for the understanding of the
morphology and stability of RBC aggregates, but also for a whole class of
interacting soft deformable objects such as vesicles, capsules or cells in
tissues.

improve the efficiency of anonymous fingerprinting for the legal distribution
of copyrighted multimedia contents in P2P systems. The recombination idea is
inspired by the principles of mating, recombination and heredity of the DNA
sequences of living beings, but applied to binary sequences, like in genetic
algorithms. However, the existing recombination-based fingerprinting systems do
not provide a convenient solution for collusion resistance, since they require
double-layer fingerprinting codes, making the practical implementation of such
systems a challenging task. In fact, collusion resistance is regarded as the
most relevant requirement of a fingerprinting scheme, and the lack of any
acceptable solution to this problem would possibly deter content merchants from
deploying any practical implementation of the recombination approach. In this
paper, this drawback is overcome by introducing two non-trivial improvements,
paving the way for a future real-life application of recombination-based
systems. First, Nuida et al.'s collusion-resistant codes are used in
segment-wise fashion for the first time. Second, a novel version of the
traitor-tracing algorithm is proposed in the encrypted domain, also for the
first time, making it possible to provide the buyers with security against
framing. In addition, the proposed method avoids the use of public-key
cryptography for the multimedia content and expensive cryptographic protocols,
leading to excellent performance in terms of both computational and
communication burdens. The paper also analyzes the security and privacy
properties of the proposed system both formally and informally, whereas the
collusion resistance and the performance of the method are shown by means of
experiments and simulations.

convex body in the plane whose densest lattice packing has the smallest density
is a smoothed octagon. This conjecture is still open. We formulate the
Reinhardt Conjecture as a problem in optimal control theory. The smoothed
octagon is a Pontryagin extremal trajectory with bang-bang control. More
generally, the smoothed regular $6k+2$-gon is a Pontryagin extremal with
bang-bang control. The smoothed octagon is a strict (micro) local minimum to
the optimal control problem. The optimal solution to the Reinhardt problem is a
trajectory without singular arcs. The extremal trajectories that do not meet
the singular locus have bang-bang controls with finitely many switching times.
Finally, we reduce the Reinhardt problem to an optimization problem on a
five-dimensional manifold. (Each point on the manifold is an initial condition
for a potential Pontryagin extremal lifted trajectory.) We suggest that the
Reinhardt conjecture might eventually be fully resolved through optimal control
theory. Some proofs are computer-assisted using a computer algebra system.

cells produce, secrete, and respond to a threshold level of an autoinducer (AI)
molecule, thereby modulating gene expression. However, the biology of QS
remains incompletely understood in heterogeneous communities, where variant
bacterial strains possess distinct QS systems that produce chemically unique
AIs. AI molecules bind to 'cognate' receptors, but also to 'non-cognate'
receptors found in other strains, resulting in inter-strain crosstalk.
Understanding these interactions is a prerequisite for deciphering the
consequences of crosstalk in real ecosystems, where multiple AIs are regularly
present in the same environment. As a step towards this goal, we map crosstalk
in a heterogeneous community of variant QS strains onto an artificial neural
network model. This formulation allows us to systematically analyze how
crosstalk regulates the community's capacity for flexible decision making, as
quantified by the Boltzmann entropy of all QS gene expression states of the
system. In a mean-field limit of complete cross-inhibition between variant
strains, the model is exactly solvable, allowing for an analytical formula for
the number of variants that maximize capacity as a function of signal kinetics
and activation parameters. An analysis of previous experimental results on the
Staphylococcus aureus two-component Agr system indicates that the observed
combination of variant numbers, gene expression rates and threshold
concentrations lies near this critical regime of parameter space where capacity
peaks. The results are suggestive of a potential evolutionary driving force for
diversification in certain QS systems.

subformula property. Many different proof formalisms have been introduced (e.g.
sequent, nested sequent, labelled sequent formalisms) in order to provide such
calculi for the many logics of interest. The nested sequent formalism was
recently generalised to indexed nested sequents in order to yield proof calculi
with the subformula property for extensions of the modal logic K by
(Lemmon-Scott) Geach axioms. The proofs of completeness and cut-elimination
therein were semantic and intricate. Here we show that derivations in the
labelled sequent formalism whose sequents are `almost treelike' correspond
exactly to indexed nested sequents. This correspondence is exploited to induce
syntactic proofs for indexed nested sequent calculi making use of the elegant
proofs that exist for the labelled sequent calculi. A larger goal of this work
is to demonstrate how specialising existing proof-theoretic transformations
alleviate the need for independent proofs in each formalism. Such coercion can
also be used to induce new cutfree calculi. We employ this to present the first
indexed nested sequent calculi for intermediate logics.

binary-input DMC for three different covertness metrics and under maximum
probability of error constraint. When covertness is measured in terms of the
relative entropy between the channel output distributions induced with and
without communication, we characterize the exact first- and second-order
asymptotics of the number of bits that can be reliably transmitted with a
maximum probability of error less than $\epsilon$ and a relative entropy less
than $\delta$. When covertness is measured in terms of the variational distance
between the channel output distributions or in terms of the probability of
missed detection for fixed probability of false alarm, we establish the exact
first-order asymptotics and bound the second-order asymptotics. PPM achieves
the optimal first-order asymptotics for all three metrics, as well as the
optimal second-order asymptotics for relative entropy. The main conceptual
contribution of this paper is to clarify how the choice of a covertness metric
impacts the information-theoretic limits of covert communications. The main

new products and services. But how do economies learn? And who do they learn
from? The literature on economic geography and economic development has
emphasized two learning channels: inter-industry learning, which involves
learning from related industries; and inter-regional learning, which involves
learning from neighboring regions. Here we use 25 years of data describing the
evolution of China's economy between 1990 and 2015--a period when China
multiplied its GDP per capita by a factor of ten--to explore how Chinese
provinces diversified their economies. First, we show that the probability that
a province will develop a new industry increases with the number of related
industries that are already present in that province, a fact that is suggestive
of inter-industry learning. Also, we show that the probability that a province
will develop an industry increases with the number of neighboring provinces
that are developed in that industry, a fact suggestive of inter-regional
learning. Moreover, we find that the combination of these two channels exhibit
diminishing returns, meaning that the contribution of either of these learning
channels is redundant when the other one is present. Finally, we address
endogeneity concerns by using the introduction of high-speed rail as an
instrument to isolate the effects of inter-regional learning. Our
differences-in-differences (DID) analysis reveals that the introduction of high
speed-rail increased the industrial similarity of pairs of provinces connected
by high-speed rail. Also, industries in provinces that were connected by rail
increased their productivity when they were connected by rail to other
provinces where that industry was already present. These findings suggest that
inter-regional and inter-industry learning played a role in China's great
economic expansion.

statically detect anomalous, hence likely buggy, program behavior. The
distinctive insight here is to build a statistical model that correlates all
specifications hidden inside a corpus with the syntax and observed behavior of
programs that implement these specifications. During the analysis of a
particular program, this model is conditioned into a posterior distribution
that prioritizes specifications that are relevant to this program. This allows
accurate program analysis even if the corpus is highly heterogeneous. The
problem of finding anomalies is now framed quantitatively, as a problem of
computing a distance between a ""reference distribution"" over program behaviors
that our model expects from the program, and the distribution over behaviors
that the program actually produces.
  We present a concrete embodiment of our framework that combines a topic model
and a neural network model to learn specifications, and queries the learned
models to compute anomaly scores. We evaluate this implementation on the task
of detecting anomalous usage of Android APIs. Our encouraging experimental
results show that the method can automatically discover subtle errors in
Android applications in the wild, and has high precision and recall compared to
competing probabilistic approaches.

Making use of a population game model and the well-known Chung-Lu random graph
model, we study how one could encourage selfish agents to invest more in
security by internalizing the externalities produced by their security
investments.
  To this end, we first establish an interesting relation between the local
minimizers of social cost and the Nash equilibria of a population game with
slightly altered costs. Secondly, under a mild technical assumption, we
demonstrate that there exists a unique minimizer of social cost and it
coincides with the unique Nash equilibrium of the population game. This finding
tells us how to modify the private cost functions of selfish agents in order to
enhance the overall security and reduce social cost. In addition, it reveals
how the sensitivity of overall security to security investments of agents
influences their externalities and, consequently, penalties or taxes that
should be imposed for internalization of externalities. Finally, we illustrate
how the degree distribution of agents influences their security investments and
overall security at both the NEs of population games and social optima.

iterative methods require extensive calculations but can not deliver
satisfactory results. Based on the observation that the artifacts from limited

a novel multi-scale wavelet domain residual learning architecture, which

a direct residual learning approach on directional wavelet domain to solve this

the new network estimates the noise of each input wavelet transform, and then
the de-noised wavelet coefficients are obtained by subtracting the noise from

favors in building mutual interactions. High reciprocity has been widely
observed in many directed social media networks such as following relations in
Twitter and Tumblr. Therefore, reciprocal relations between users are often
regarded as a basic mechanism to create stable social ties and play a crucial
role in the formation and evolution of networks. Each reciprocity relation is
formed by two parasocial links in a back-and-forth manner with a time delay.
Hence, understanding the delay can help us gain better insights into the
underlying mechanisms of network dynamics. Meanwhile, the accurate prediction
of delay has practical implications in advancing a variety of real-world
applications such as friend recommendation and marketing campaign. For example,
by knowing when will users follow back, service providers can focus on the
users with a potential long reciprocal delay for effective targeted marketing.
This paper presents the initial investigation of the time delay in reciprocal
relations. Our study is based on a large-scale directed network from Tumblr
that consists of 62.8 million users and 3.1 billion user following relations
with a timespan of multiple years (from 31 Oct 2007 to 24 Jul 2013). We reveal
a number of interesting patterns about the delay that motivate the development
of a principled learning model to predict the delay in reciprocal relations.
Experimental results on the above mentioned dynamic networks corroborate the
effectiveness of the proposed delay prediction model.

possible to reconstruct the geometry of an unknown environment using sparse and
incomplete depth measurements? Reconstruction from incomplete data is not
possible in general, but when the robot operates in man-made environments, the
depth exhibits some regularity (e.g., many planar surfaces with only a few
edges); we leverage this regularity to infer depth from a small number of
measurements. Our first contribution is a formulation of the depth
reconstruction problem that bridges robot perception with the compressive
sensing literature in signal processing. The second contribution includes a set
of formal results that ascertain the exactness and stability of the depth
reconstruction in 2D and 3D problems, and completely characterize the geometry
of the profiles that we can reconstruct. Our third contribution is a set of
practical algorithms for depth reconstruction: our formulation directly
translates into algorithms for depth estimation based on convex programming. In
real-world problems, these convex programs are very large and general-purpose
solvers are relatively slow. For this reason, we discuss ad-hoc solvers that
enable fast depth reconstruction in real problems. The last contribution is an
extensive experimental evaluation in 2D and 3D problems, including Monte Carlo
runs on simulated instances and testing on multiple real datasets. Empirical
results confirm that the proposed approach ensures accurate depth

diffeological spaces such that the diffeological counterpart \Lambda^1(X) of
the cotangent bundle, the so-called pseudo-bundle of values of differential
1-forms, has bounded dimension. The operator is defined as the composition of
the Levi-Civita connection on the exterior algebra pseudo-bundle
\bigwedge(\Lambda^1(X)) with the standardly defined Clifford action by
\Lambda^1(X); the latter is therefore assumed to admit a pseudo-metric for
which there exists a Levi-Civita connection. Under these assumptions, the
definition is fully analogous the standard case, and our main conclusion is
that this is the only way to define the De Rham operator on a diffeological
space, since we show that there is not a straightforward counterpart of the
definition of the De Rham operator as the sum d+d^* of the exterior
differential with its adjoint. We show along the way that other connected
notions do not have full counterparts, in terms of the function they are
supposed to fulfill, either; this regards, for instance, volume forms, the
Hodge star, and the distinction between the $k$-th exterior degree of

its non-uniform Fourier samples using a convex matrix completion algorithm. We
assume the discontinuities/edges of the image are localized to the zero
levelset of a bandlimited function. This assumption induces linear dependencies
between the Fourier coefficients of the image, which results in a two-fold
block Toeplitz matrix constructed from the Fourier coefficients being low-rank.
The proposed algorithm reformulates the recovery of the unknown Fourier
coefficients as a structured low-rank matrix completion problem, where the
nuclear norm of the matrix is minimized subject to structure and data
constraints. We show that exact recovery is possible with high probability when
the edge set of the image satisfies an incoherency property. We also show that
the incoherency property is dependent on the geometry of the edge set curve,
implying higher sampling burden for smaller curves. This paper generalizes
recent work on the super-resolution recovery of isolated Diracs or signals with
finite rate of innovation to the recovery of piecewise constant images.

rotation frequency enhances the creation of giant vortices for the initially
miscible BECs, while it can lead to the formation of semiring density patterns
with irregular hidden vortex structures for the initially immiscible BECs.
Without rotation, strong 2D isotropic SOC yields a heliciform-stripe phase for
the initially immiscible BECs. Combined effects of rotation, SOC, and
interatomic interactions on the vortex structures and typical spin textures of
the ground state of the system are discussed systematically. In particular, for
fixed rotation frequency above the critical value, the increasing isotropic SOC
favors a visible vortex ring in each component which is accompanied by a hidden
giant vortex plus a (several) hidden vortex ring(s) in the central region. In
the case of 1D anisotropic SOC, large SOC strength results in the generation of
hidden linear vortex string and the transition from initial phase separation
(phase mixing) to phase mixing (phase separation). Furthermore, the peculiar
spin textures including skyrmion lattice, skyrmion pair and skyrmion string are

causes this large discrepancy, and how does nature speed up contact by 2 orders

substrates by either coating a liquid film on glass or using a freshly cleaved

Interestingly, we discover two distinct speed-up approaches: (1) droplet
skidding due to even minute perturbations breaks rotational symmetry and
produces early contact at the thinnest gap location, and (2) for the
unperturbed situation with rotational symmetry, a previously unnoticed boundary
flow around only 0.1 mm/s expedites air drainage by over 1 order of magnitude.
Together, these two mechanisms universally explain general contact phenomena on

""exact"" phase diagram of the XYZ spin chain. First we identify the Ising order
along $\hat x$ or $\hat y$ as attractive renormalization group fixed points of
the Kitaev chain. Then in a global phase space composed of the anisotropy
$\lambda$ of the XY interaction and the coupling $\Delta$ of the
$\Delta\sigma^z\sigma^z$ interaction we find that the above fixed points remain
attractive in the two dimesional parameter space. We therefore classify the
gapped phases of the XYZ spin chain as: (1) either attracted to the Ising limit
of the Kitaev-chain which in turn is characterized by winding number $\pm 1$
depending whether the Ising order parameter is along $\hat x$ or $\hat y$
directions; or (2) attracted to the Mott phases of the underlying Jordan-Wigner
fermions which is characterized by zero winding number. We therefore establish
that the exact phase boundaries of the XYZ model in Baxter's solution indeed
correspond to topological phase transitions. The topological nature of the
phase transitions of the XYZ model justifies why our analytical solution of the
three-site problem which is at the core of the renormalization group treatment
is able to produce the exact phase diagram of Baxter's solution. We argue that
the distribution of the winding numbers between the three Ising phases is a
matter of choice of the coordinate system, and therefore the Mott-Ising phase
is entitled to host apprpriate form of zero modes. We further observe that the
renormalization group flow can be cast into a geometric progression of a
properly identified parameter. We show that this new parameter is actually the
size of the (Majorana) zero modes.

with the detection of three Earth-sized planets transiting (i.e. passing in

transiting configuration of these planets with the Jupiter-like size of their
host star - named TRAPPIST-1 - makes possible in-depth studies of their
atmospheric properties with current and future astronomical facilities. Here we
report the results of an intensive photometric monitoring campaign of that star

that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to the Earth revolve
around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain such that
their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.21, 12.35 days) are near
ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed
farther from the star and migrated inward. The seven planets have equilibrium

relatively, easy-to-build ecosystems nature inherited from the web and the
capacity for building end-to-end solutions. At the WoT connecting physical
devices such as sensors, RFID tags or any devices that can send data through
the Internet using the Web is almost automatic. The WoT shared data can be used
to build smarter solutions that offer business services in the form of IoT
applications. In this chapter, we review the main WoT challenges, with
particular interest on highlighting those that rely on combining heterogeneous
IoT data for the design of smarter services and applications and that benefit
from data interoperability. Semantic web technologies help for overcoming with
such challenges by addressing, among other ones the following objectives: 1)
semantically annotating and unifying heterogeneous data, 2) enriching semantic
WoT datasets with external knowledge graphs, and 3) providing an analysis of
data by means of reasoning mechanisms to infer meaningful information. To
overcome the challenge of building interoperable semantics-based IoT
applications, the Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) semantic engine has been
designed to semantically annotate WoT data, build the logic of smarter services

negligible contribution. The high lattice thermal conductivity is due to large
group velocities, small Gr$\mathrm{\ddot{u}}$neisen parameters, and long phonon
lifetimes. The size effects on lattice thermal conductivity are considered by
cumulative thermal conductivity with respect to phonon mean free path(MFP). To
significantly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, the characteristic

challenging due to requiring oscillator synchronization for all nodes, a
problem further exacerbated by Doppler shift. This work develops a noncoherent

produces soft outputs suitable for use with capacity-approaching channel codes

the formulation is the presence of an infinite summation in the received symbol

truncated summation contains a sufficient number of terms. Bit error rate
performance is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation, considering modulation
orders two, four and eight, channel coded and uncoded operation, and with and

critically important in the determination of many transport properties of
matter in supernovae and the crust of neutron stars. Using a set of
self-consistent microscopic nuclear energy density functionals we present the
first results of large scale quantum simulations of pasta phases at baryon
densities $0.03 \leq \rho \leq 0.10$ fm$^{-3}$, proton fractions $0.05 \leq Y_p
\leq 0.40$, and zero temperature. The full quantum simulations, in particular,
allow us to thoroughly investigate the role and impact of the nuclear symmetry
energy on pasta configurations. We use the Sky3D code that solves the Skyrme
Hartree-Fock equations on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid. For the nuclear
interaction we use the state of the art UNEDF1 parametrization, which was
introduced to study largely deformed nuclei, hence is suitable for studies of
the nuclear pasta. Density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is
simulated by tuning two purely isovector observables that are insensitive to
the current available experimental data. We find that a minimum total number of
nucleons $A=2000$ is necessary to prevent the results from containing spurious
shell effects and to minimize finite size effects. We find that a variety of
nuclear pasta geometries are present in the neutron star crust and the result
strongly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy. The impact of the nuclear
symmetry energy is less pronounced as the proton fractions increase. Quantum
nuclear pasta calculations at $T=0$ MeV are shown to get easily trapped in
meta-stable states, and possible remedies to avoid meta-stable solutions are

recommendation systems, where the so-called implicit consumer data is modeled
by a factorized Poisson distribution. There are many variants of Poisson
factorization methods who show state-of-the-art performance on real-world
recommendation tasks. However, most of them do not explicitly take into account
the temporal behavior and the recurrent activities of users which is essential
to recommend the right item to the right user at the right time. In this paper,
we introduce Recurrent Poisson Factorization (RPF) framework that generalizes
the classical PF methods by utilizing a Poisson process for modeling the
implicit feedback. RPF treats time as a natural constituent of the model and
brings to the table a rich family of time-sensitive factorization models. To
elaborate, we instantiate several variants of RPF who are capable of handling
dynamic user preferences and item specification (DRPF), modeling the
social-aspect of product adoption (SRPF), and capturing the consumption
heterogeneity among users and items (HRPF). We also develop a variational
algorithm for approximate posterior inference that scales up to massive data
sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate RPF's superior performance over many
state-of-the-art methods on synthetic dataset, and large scale real-world
datasets on music streaming logs, and user-item interactions in M-Commerce
platforms.

QECKRocchio. We conduct three experiments to evaluate our QECK technique and

parameter is small (e.g. small noise), deviations from the deterministic case
are well described by the Freidlin-Wentzell theory. In particular, escapes over
the potential barrier are very rare events. When the parameter is large (e.g.
large noise), such events become typical. Unlike pure noise-induced
transitions, the distribution of the escape time is peaked around a value which
is asymptotically predicted by an adiabatic approximation. We show that the two

$\kappa$-dependent temperature of the suprathermal (halo) electrons for any

distributional shifts caused by these changes. Traditionally, this problem has
been addressed via the collection of labelled data in multiple domains or by
imposing priors on the type of shift between both domains. We frame the problem
in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation and develop a framework for
applying adversarial techniques to adapt popular, state-of-the-art network
architectures with the additional objective to align features across domains.
Moreover, as adversarial training is notoriously unstable, we first perform an
extensive ablation study, adapting many techniques known to stabilise
generative adversarial networks, and evaluate on a surrogate classification
task with the same appearance change. The distilled insights are applied to the
problem of free-space segmentation for motion planning in autonomous driving.

  Equations",,,"10.1140/epjd/e2017-80327-y",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article is part of a series of articles trying to establish the concept
Molecular Field. The theory that induced us to introduce this novel concept is
based on the Born-Huang expansion as applied to the Schroedinger equation that
describes the interaction of a molecular system with an external electric
field. Assuming the molecular system is made up of two coupled adiabatic states
the theory leads from a single spatial Curl Equation, two space-time Curl
equations and one single space-time Divergent equation to a pair of decoupled
Wave Equations usually encountered within the theory of fields. In the present
study the Wave Equations are derived for an external field having two features:
(a) its intensity is high enough; (b) its duration is short enough. For this
situation the study reveals that the just described interaction creates two
fields that coexist within a molecule: one is a novel vectorial field formed
via the interaction of the external field with the Born-Huang non-adiabatic
coupling terms (NACT) and the other is an ordinary, scalar, electric field
essentially identical to the original external field. Part of the present study
is devoted to the visualization of the outcomes via two intersecting
Jahn-Teller cones which contain NACTs that become singular at their
intersection point, also known as the point of Conical Intersection. This
description is reminiscent of a metaphoric cosmic Black-Hole which swallows one
type of an electric field and creates a new type. Finally, the fact that
eventually we are facing a kind of a cosmic situation may bring us to speculate
that singular NACTs are a result of cosmic phenomena. Thus, if indeed this
singularity is somehow connected to reality then, like other singularities in
physics, it is formed at (or immediately after) the Big Bang (and because of
that, eventually the ability to form molecules).

nuclei with realistic single-particle energies in which two configurations with
Pauli blocking of nucleon-pair orbits due to the formation of the s-bosons is
taken into account. When the nucleon-pair orbits are considered to be
independent of the s-bosons, the BCS-BEC crossover becomes smooth with the
number of the s-bosons noticeably more than that of the nucleonpairs near the
half-shell point, a feature that is demonstrated in the pf-shell for several
values of the standard pairing interaction strength. As a further test of the
robustness of the BCS-BEC coexistence and crossover phenomena in nuclei,
results are given for B(E2; 0^{+}_{g}->2^{+}_1) values of even-even 102-130Sn

molecular system perturbed by an external field yields a set of decoupled
vectorial Wave Equations, just like in Electromagnetism. This finding led us to
declare on the existence of a new type of Fields, which were termed Molecular
Fields. The fact that such fields exist implies that at the vicinity of conical
intersections exist a mechanism that transforms a passing-by electric beam into
a field which differs from the original electric field. This situation is
reminiscent of what is encountered in astronomy where Black Holes formed by
massive stars may affect the nature of a near-by beam of light. Thus if the
NonAdiabatic-Coupling-Terms (NACT) with their singular points may affect the
nature of such a beam (see the above two publications) then it would be
interesting to know to what extend NACTs (and consequently also the BH
equation) will be affected by the special theory of relativity as introduced by
Dirac. Indeed while applying the Dirac approach we derived the relativistic
affected NACTs as well as the corresponding BH equation.

applications such as light emitters compatible with CMOS technology or
frequency converter systems for photovoltaic cells. In this study, amorphous
Tb3+ ion doped nitrogen-rich silicon oxynitride (NRSON) thin films were
fabricated using a reactive magnetron co-sputtering method, with various N2
flows and annealing conditions, in order to study their structural and emission
properties. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements and refractive index
values confirmed the silicon oxynitride nature of the films. An electron
microscopy analysis conducted for different annealing temperatures (T A) was
also performed up to 1200 {\textdegree}C. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images revealed two different sublayers. The top layer showed porosities
coming from a degassing of oxygen during deposition and annealing, while in the
region close to the substrate, a multilayer-like structure of SiO2 and Si3N4
phases appeared, involving a spinodal decomposition. Upon a 1200 {\textdegree}C
annealing treatment, a significant density of Tb clusters was detected,
indicating a higher thermal threshold of rare earth (RE) clusterization in
comparison to the silicon oxide matrix. With an opposite variation of the N2
flow during the deposition, the nitrogen excess parameter (Nex) estimated by
RBS measurements was introduced to investigate the Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrum behavior and emission properties. Different vibration modes of
the Si--N and Si--O bonds have been carefully identified from the FTIR spectra
characterizing such host matrices, especially the 'out-of-phase' stretching
vibration mode of the Si--O bond. The highest Tb3+ photoluminescence (PL)
intensity was obtained by optimizing the N incorporation and the annealing
conditions. In addition, according to these conditions, the integrated PL
intensity variation confirmed that the silicon nitride-based host matrix had a
higher thermal threshold of rare earth clusterization than its silicon oxide
counterpart. Analysis of time-resolved PL intensity versus T A showed the
impact of Tb clustering on decay times, in agreement with the TEM observations.
Finally, PL and PL excitation (PLE) experiments and comparison of the related
spectra between undoped and Tb-doped samples were carried out to investigate
the impact of the band tails on the excitation mechanism of Tb3+ ions.

ingredient in the context of smart grid (SG). Nevertheless, the rising concerns
over privacy issues raised by customers subscribed to these programs constitute
a major threat towards their effective deployment and utilization. This has
driven extensive research to resolve the hindrance confronted, resulting in a
number of methods being proposed for preserving customers' privacy. While these
methods provide stringent privacy guarantees, only limited attention has been
paid to their computational efficiency and performance quality. Under the
paradigm of differential privacy, this paper initiates a systematic empirical
study on quantifying the trade-off between privacy and optimality in
centralized DR systems for maximizing cumulative customer utility. Aiming to
elucidate the factors governing this trade-off, we analyze the cost of privacy
in terms of the effect incurred on the objective value of the DR optimization
problem when applying the employed privacy-preserving strategy based on Laplace
mechanism. The theoretical results derived from the analysis are complemented
with empirical findings, corroborated extensively by simulations on a 4-bus MG
system with up to thousands of customers. By evaluating the impact of privacy,
this pilot study serves DR practitioners when considering the social and
economic implications of deploying privacy-preserving DR programs in practice.
Moreover, it stimulates further research on exploring more efficient approaches
with bounded performance guarantees for optimizing energy procurement of MGs
without infringing the privacy of customers on demand side.

of the survey, including host-galaxy reference images and updated data
processing and host-galaxy reference subtraction. SweetSpot will provide a
well-calibrated sample that will help improve our ability to standardize
distance measurements to SNe Ia, examine the intrinsic optical-NIR colors of
SNe Ia at different epochs, explore nature of dust in other galaxies, and act
as a stepping stone for more distant, potentially space-based surveys.

of reactivity worth measurement. The inverse kinetics method has been used to
measure the reactivity worth of {\phi}20mmx9mm Au, V and Be samples at the
