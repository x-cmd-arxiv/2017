decades, however, literature on non-monetary metrics that reveal the status of
China's regional economic development are still lacking. In this paper, we fill
this gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through
analyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic
complexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'
ECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic
development and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of
ECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare
different measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with
monetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the
non-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have
stronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate
regressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other
socioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better
understanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary
macroeconomic indicators.

desirable in terms of efficiency. Here we show that restart may have profound
consequences on the splitting probabilities of a Bernoulli-like first-passage
process, i.e. of a process which can end with one of two outcomes. Particularly
intriguing in this respect is the class of problems where a carefully adjusted
restart mechanism maximizes probability that the process will complete in a

of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires
mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to
address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has
proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to
our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For
Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the
Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches
traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed,
because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the
computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because
AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic
illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that
replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only
one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable
topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.

not likely to follow linear evolutionary paths. To estimate the significance of
sensitivity selection effects we perform a Monte Carlo sensitivity simulation

tetrads and spin-connections is perhaps the best theory candidate for
gravitation to be unified with the other three elementary forces of nature.
There is a clear analogy between local frame in PGG and local internal symmetry
space in the Standard Model. As a result, the spin-connection fields, gauging
the local frame Lorentz symmetry group SO(1,3)_{LF}, appear in PGG much as
photons and gluons appear in SM. We propose that such an analogy may follow
from their common emergent nature allowing to derive PGG in the same way as
conventional gauge theories. In essence, we start with an arbitrary theory of
some vector and fermion fields which possesses only global spacetime
symmetries, such as Lorentz and translational invariance, in flat Minkowski
space. The two vector field multiplets involved are proposed to belong,
respectively, to the adjoint (A_{{\mu}}^{ij}) and vector (e_{{\mu}}^{i})
representations of the starting global Lorentz symmetry. We show that if these
prototype vector fields are covariantly constrained,
A_{{\mu}}^{ij}A_{ij}^{{\mu}}=M_{A} and e_{{\mu}}^{i}e_{i}^{{\mu}}=M_{e}, thus
causing a spontaneous violation of the accompanying global symmetries (M_{A,e}
are their proposed violation scales), then the only possible theory compatible
with these length-preserving constraints is turned out to be the gauge
invariant PGG, while the corresponding massless (pseudo)Goldstone modes are
naturally collected in the emergent gauge fields of tetrads and
spin-connections. In a minimal theory case being linear in a curvature we
unavoidably come to the Einstein-Cartan theory. The extending theories with
propagating spin-connection and tetrad modes are also considered and their
possible unification with the Standard Model is briefly discussed.

amplification (WVA) and related parameter estimation methods in the presence of
temporally correlated noise. WVA is a special instance of a general measurement
strategy that involves sorting data into separate subsets based on the outcome
of a second ""partitioning"" measurement. Using a simplified noise model that can
be analyzed exactly together with optimal statistical estimators, we compare
WVA to a conventional measurement method. We find that introducing WVA indeed
yields a much lower variance of the parameter of interest than does the
conventional technique, optimized in the absence of any partitioning
measurements. In contrast, a statistically optimal analysis that employs
partitioning measurements, incorporating all partitioned results and their
known correlations, is found to yield an improvement -- typically slight --
over the noise reduction achieved by WVA. This is because the simple WVA
technique is not tailored to a given noise environment and therefore does not
make use of correlations between the different partitions. We also compare WVA
to traditional background subtraction, a familiar technique where measurement
outcomes are partitioned to eliminate unknown offsets or errors in calibration.
Surprisingly, in our model background subtraction turns out to be a special
case of the optimal partitioning approach in the balanced case, possessing a
similar typically slight advantage over WVA. These results give deeper insight
into the role of partitioning measurements, with or without post-selection, in
enhancing measurement precision, which some have found puzzling. We finish by
presenting numerical results to model a more realistic laboratory situation of
time-decaying correlations, showing our conclusions hold for a wide range of
statistical models.

randomization of the structure of dispersal network in a metapopulation model
of prey and predator increases the species persistence via clustering,
prolonged transient dynamics, and amplitudes of population fluctuations. In
this paper, by contrast, we show that a deterministic network topology in a
metapopulation can also favor asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics if
species dispersal obeys a long-range interaction governed by a
distance-dependent power-law. To explore the effects of power-law coupling, we
take a realistic ecological model, namely the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in
each patch (node) of the network of oscillators, and show that the coupled
system is driven from synchrony to asynchrony with an increase in the power-law
exponent. Moreover, to understand the relationship between species persistence
and variations in power-law exponent, we compute correlation coefficient to
characterize cluster formation, synchrony order parameter and median predator
amplitude. We further show that smaller metapopulations with less number of
patches are more vulnerable to extinction as compared to larger metapopulations

(genomic, medical data, etc.) and wants to run intensive computations on it, as
part of a machine learning algorithm for example. The master wants to
distribute these computations to untrusted workers who have volunteered or are
incentivized to help with this task. However, the data must be kept private (in
an information theoretic sense) and not revealed to the individual workers. The
workers may be busy, or even unresponsive, and will take a random time to
finish the task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the aggregate
delay experienced by the master. We focus on linear computations as an
essential operation in many iterative algorithms. A known solution is to use a
linear secret sharing scheme to divide the data into secret shares on which the
workers can compute. We propose to use instead new secure codes, called
Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the authors. We study the
delay induced by Staircase codes which is always less than that of secret
sharing. The reason is that secret sharing schemes need to wait for the
responses of a fixed fraction of the workers, whereas Staircase codes offer
more flexibility in this respect. For instance, for codes with rate $R=1/2$
Staircase codes can lead to up to $40\%$ reduction in delay compared to secret
sharing.

distribution used to compute corrected $p$-values that provide strong control
of false positives. In neuroimaging, however, the computational burden of
running such an algorithm can be significant. We find that by viewing the
permutation testing procedure as the construction of a very large permutation
testing matrix, $T$, one can exploit structural properties derived from the
data and the test statistics to reduce the runtime under certain conditions. In
particular, we see that $T$ is low-rank plus a low-variance residual. This
makes $T$ a good candidate for low-rank matrix completion, where only a very
small number of entries of $T$ ($\sim0.35\%$ of all entries in our experiments)
have to be computed to obtain a good estimate. Based on this observation, we
present RapidPT, an algorithm that efficiently recovers the max null
distribution commonly obtained through regular permutation testing in
voxel-wise analysis. We present an extensive validation on a synthetic dataset
and four varying sized datasets against two baselines: Statistical
NonParametric Mapping (SnPM13) and a standard permutation testing
implementation (referred as NaivePT). We find that RapidPT achieves its best
runtime performance on medium sized datasets ($50 \leq n \leq 200$), with
speedups of 1.5x - 38x (vs. SnPM13) and 20x-1000x (vs. NaivePT). For larger

increased by 46.4 % when compared to Fe50Pt50. The increase in magnetic
properties in Fe50-xMnxPt50 is due to the tetragonal distortion as experimental
c/a ratio is larger than the expected c/a ratio for ferromagnetically ordered

achieve large coercivity in Mn doped FePt as it leads to tetragonal distortion.

of the behavior of the squeezing function near the boundary, the behavior of
the holomorphic sectional curvature of the Bergman metric near the boundary, or
any other reasonable measure of the complex geometry near the boundary. The
first characterization gives a partial answer to a question of Forn{\ae}ss and

pseudoconvex domain is also strongly pseudoconvex.

proposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I
sources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of
evolution than Group II. Disk evolution can be constrained from the comparison
of disks with different properties. A first attempt of disk taxonomy is now
possible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig
Ae/Be stars becoming available. Near-IR images of six Group II disks in
scattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in Polarimetric Differential
Imaging, which is the most efficient technique to image the light scattered by
the disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of
this sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the
literature. Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in
the disk of HD163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure
with a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (less than
100 AU) disk is detected around HD142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17
Herbig Ae/Be sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II
is due to the presence or absence of a large disk cavity (larger than 5 AU).
There is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group I to Group II. Group
II are not evolved version of the Group I. Within the Group II disks, very
different geometries (both self-shadowed and compact) exist. HD163296 could be
the primordial version of a typical Group I. Other Group II, like AK Sco and
HD142666, could be smaller counterpart of Group I unable to open cavities as
large as those of Group I.

wind variability of the O9.5Iab star HD 188209 from Kepler space photometry and
long-term high-resolution spectroscopy. We used Kepler scattered-light
photometry obtained by the nominal mission during 1460d to deduce the
photometric variability of this O-type supergiant. In addition, we assembled
and analysed high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopy taken with four
spectrographs during some 1800d to interpret the temporal spectroscopic
variability of the star. The variability of this blue supergiant derived from
the scattered-light space photometry is in full in agreement with the one found
in the ground-based spectroscopy. We find significant low-frequency variability
that is consistently detected in all spectral lines of HD 188209. The
photospheric variability propagates into the wind, where it has similar
frequencies but slightly higher amplitudes. The morphology of the frequency
spectra derived from the long-term photometry and spectroscopy points towards a
spectrum of travelling waves with frequency values in the range expected for an
evolved O-type star. Convectively-driven internal gravity waves excited in the
stellar interior offer the most plausible explanation of the detected
variability.

long, untrimmed video consisting of multiple action instances and complex
background contents, we need not only to recognize their action categories, but
also to localize the start time and end time of each instance. Many
state-of-the-art systems use segment-level classifiers to select and rank
proposal segments of pre-determined boundaries. However, a desirable model
should move beyond segment-level and make dense predictions at a fine
granularity in time to determine precise temporal boundaries. To this end, we
design a novel Convolutional-De-Convolutional (CDC) network that places CDC
filters on top of 3D ConvNets, which have been shown to be effective for
abstracting action semantics but reduce the temporal length of the input data.
The proposed CDC filter performs the required temporal upsampling and spatial
downsampling operations simultaneously to predict actions at the frame-level
granularity. It is unique in jointly modeling action semantics in space-time
and fine-grained temporal dynamics. We train the CDC network in an end-to-end
manner efficiently. Our model not only achieves superior performance in
detecting actions in every frame, but also significantly boosts the precision
of localizing temporal boundaries. Finally, the CDC network demonstrates a very
high efficiency with the ability to process 500 frames per second on a single
GPU server. We will update the camera-ready version and publish the source
codes online soon.

equal to linear or nonlinear mixtures of the state variables of two or more
statistically independent subsystems. First, the local distributions of
measurement velocities are processed in order to derive vectors at each point
in x-space. If the data are separable, each of these vectors must be directed
along a subspace of x-space that is traversed by varying the state variable of
one subsystem, while all other subsystems are kept constant. Because of this
property, these vectors can be used to construct a small set of mappings, which
must contain the unmixing function, if it exists. Therefore, nonlinear blind
source separation can be performed by examining the separability of the data
after it has been transformed by each of these mappings. The method is
analytic, constructive, and model-independent. It is illustrated by blindly
recovering the separate utterances of two speakers from nonlinear combinations

devices across a Home Area Network (HAN). Those systems tend to rely on the

vendors tend to trust all devices connected to the HAN. This treatment exposes
them to the attack from malicious apps, particularly those running on

confirmed in our measurement study. Mitigating this threat cannot solely rely
on IoT manufacturers, which may need to change the hardware on the devices to
support encryption, increasing the cost of the device, or software developers
who we need to trust to implement security correctly.
  In this work, we present a new technique to control the communication between
the IoT devices and their apps in a unified, backward-compatible way. Our
approach, called Hanguard, does not require any changes to the IoT devices
themselves, the IoT apps or the OS of the participating phones. Hanguard
achieves a fine-grained, per-app protection through bridging the OS-level
situation awareness and the router-level per-flow control: each phone runs a
non-system userspace Monitor app to identify the party that attempts to access
the protected IoT device and inform the router through a control plane of its
access decision; the router enforces the decision on the data plane after
verifying whether the phone should be allowed to talk to the device. Hanguard
uses a role-based access control (RBAC) schema which leverages type enforcement
(TE) and multi-category security (MCS) primitives to define highly flexible
access control rules. We implemented our design over both Android and iOS (>95%
of mobile OS market share) and a popular router. Our study shows that Hanguard
is both efficient and effective in practice.

fields, for molecular simulation is the inclusion of explicit polarisation,
which represents the induction effects of charged or polar molecules on
polarisable electron clouds. Polarisation can be included through fluctuating
charges, induced multipoles or Drude dipoles. This work uses Drude dipoles and
is focused on room-temperature ionic liquids, for which fixed-charge models
predict too slow dynamics. The aim of this study is to devise a strategy to
adapt existing non-polarisable force fields upon addition of polarisation,
because induction was already contained to an extent, implicitly, due to
parametrisation against empirical data. Therefore, a fraction of the van der
Waals interaction energy should be subtracted so that the Lennard-Jones terms
only account for dispersion and the Drude dipoles for induction.
Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is used to resolve the dispersion
and induction terms in dimers and to calculate scaling factors to reduce the
Lennard-Jones terms from the non-polarisable model. Simply adding Drude dipoles
to an existing fixed-charge model already improves the prediction of transport
properties, increasing diffusion coefficients and lowering the viscosity.
Scaling down the Lennard-Jones terms leads to still faster dynamics and to
densities that match experiment extremely well. The concept developed here
improves the prediction of density and transport properties and can be adapted
to other models and systems. The inclusion of polarisation and the down-scaling
of Lennard-Jones terms affects onyl slightly the ordering of the first shell of
counterions, leading to small decreases in coordination numbers. The effect of
polarisation is major beyond first neighbours, weakening spatial correlations,
a structural effect related to the faster dynamics of polarisable models.

typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using

in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both
its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity
(DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this
regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series

gravitational fragmentation problem as well as an accretion problem. Molecular
cloud structure can be understood as a fragmentation process driven by the
interplay of turbulence, magnetic fields, and gravity (acting on either a
dynamical or ambipolar-diffusion time scale). This results in a natural way to
understand filamentary structure as magnetic ribbons that have an apparent
width that scales differently than the Jeans length. Recent work also shows
that stellar mass accretion through a disk is episodic. We show through
numerical simulations that bursts of FU Ori type may be clustered, since the

consistent with an expectation of a larger number of substellar objects than

accelerate the calculation of energy differences of relevance to chemical

ionization potentials and electron affinities of the atoms contained in the G2

fixed-geometry processes with correlated sampling-based AFQMC and relaxation
energies via MP2, to compute the ionization potential, deprotonation
free-energy, and the O-H bond disocciation energy of methanol, all to within
chemical accuracy. We show that the efficiency of correlated sampling relative
to uncorrelated calculations increases with system and basis set size, and that
correlated sampling greatly reduces the required number of random walkers to
achieve a target statistical error. This translates to CPU-time speed-up
factors of 55, 25, and 24 for the the ionization potential of the K atom, the
deprotonation of methanol, and hydrogen abstraction from the O-H bond of

transmission efficiency during peak traffic times, has recently become quite
popular among the coding community. Generally rate can be measured to the
transmission in the peak traffic times, i.e., this efficiency increases with
the decreasing of rate. In order to implement a coded caching scheme, each file
in the library must be split in a certain number of packets. And this number
directly reflects the complexity of a coded caching scheme, i.e., the
complexity increases with the increasing of the packet number. However there
exists a tradeoff between the rate and packet number. So it is meaningful to
characterize this tradeoff and design the related Pareto-optimal coded caching
schemes with respect to both parameters.
  Recently, a new concept called placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed to
characterize the coded caching scheme. However as far as we know no one has yet
proved that one of the previously known PDAs is Pareto-optimal. In this paper,
we first derive two lower bounds on the rate under the framework of PDA.
Consequently, the PDA proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen is Pareto-optimal, and
a tradeoff between rate and packet number is obtained for some parameters.
Then, from the above observations and the view point of combinatorial design,
two new classes of Pareto-optimal PDAs are obtained. Based on these PDAs, the
schemes with low rate and packet number are obtained. Finally the performance
of some previously known PDAs are estimated by comparing with these two classes
of schemes.

a viable mechanism for superconductivity in these cuprates via an unusual
lattice vibration in which an electron is predominantly interacting with a
nonlinear $Q_2$ mode of the oxygen clusters in the CuO$_2$ planes. It is shown
that the interaction has explicit d-wave symmetry and leads to an indirect
coupling of d-wave symmetry between electrons. As a follow-up of
\cite{Lee:JSNM09}, in this paper, we report detailed derivation of the
superconducting gap equation and numerical solutions for the transition
temperature as inherently integrated into the so-called Extended Hubbard Model
(EHM). A unique feature in the EHM is that the transition temperature has an
inherent k-dependence. In addition, superconducting gap solutions are
restrained to specific regions in the first Brillouin zone (1BZ). It is very
feasible to expect that the EHM naturally inherits a huge parameter space in
which experimentally measured results, such as the well-known superconducting
dome and the phase diagram from electronic Raman scattering \cite{Sacuto:RPP13}
can be accommodated. The EHM model hence offers a viable venue to search for or
confirm any signature in k-point-sensitive experimental measurements.

attention to effects of BH mass function on the total mass and mass ratio

populations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from
models with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass
functions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low
metallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we
consider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore
stellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity. Our results imply
that most BH binary mergers take place after they get ejected from the cluster.
Also, mass ratios of dynamically formed binaries should be close to one or
likely to be less than 2:1. Since the binary formation efficiency is larger for
higher-mass BHs, it is likely that a BH mass function sampled by
gravitational-wave observations would be weighed toward higher masses than the
mass function of single BHs for a dynamically formed population. Applying
conservative assumptions regarding globular cluster populations such as small
BH mass fraction and no primordial binaries, the merger rate of BH binaries
originated from globular clusters is estimated to be at least 6.5 per yr per

different dependences of the signal (cosmic magnification) and contamination

directly on the measured cross galaxy angular power spectra between different

conventional cylindrical hohlraum configuration are the two daunting challenges
on the approach to ignition in indirectly driven inertial confinement fusion.
Recently, near-vacuum cylindrical hohlraum (NVCH), octahedral spherical
hohlraum (SH) and novel three-axis cylindrical hohlraum (TACH) were proposed to
mitigate these issues. While the coupling efficiency might still be a critical
risk. In this paper, an advanced three-axis elliptical hohlraum (TAEH) is
proposed to make a compromise among these hohlraum performance. Preliminary
simulations indicate that the TAEH (with a case-to-capsule ratio, CCR=2.8)
could provide excellent radiation symmetry during the thorough laser pulse of
the high-foot drive, comparable to the ones inside the SH (CCR=5.1) and TACH
(CCR=2.2). The filling time of plasma affecting the LPIs is between those of SH
and TACH, and about 1.5 times of that in the ignition hohlraum Rev5-CH of NIC
and close to the one inside the NVCH (CCR=3.4). In particular, the coupling
efficiency is about 22%, 29% and 17% higher than the one inside the NVCH, SH
and TACH, respectively. It would be envisioned that the proposed hohlraum
configuration merits consideration as an alternative route to indirect-drive
ignition, complementary to the traditional cylindrical hohlraum and the
proposed recently novel hohlraums.

sources. Conventionally, the effective source size is estimated from the extent
of the experimental biprism interference pattern created on the detector by
applying the van Cittert Zernike theorem. Previously reported experimental
intensity distributions on the detector exhibit Gaussian distribution and our
simulations show that this is an indication that such electron sources must be
at least partially coherent. This, in turn means that strictly speaking the Van
Cittert Zernike theorem cannot be applied, since it assumes an incoherent
source. The approach of applying the van Cittert Zernike theorem is examined in
more detail by performing simulations of interference patterns for the electron
sources of different size and different coherence length, evaluating the
effective source size from the extent of the simulated interference pattern and
comparing the obtained result with the pre-defined value. The intensity
distribution of the source is assumed to be Gaussian distributed, as it is
observed in experiments. The visibility or the contrast in the simulated
holograms is found to be always less than 1 which agrees well with previously
reported experimental results and thus can be explained solely by the Gaussian
intensity distribution of the source. The effective source size estimated from

mission, the near-Earth binary asteroid 65803 Didymos represents a special
class of binary asteroids, those whose primaries are at risk of rotational
disruption. To gain a better understanding of these binary systems and to
support the AIDA mission, this paper investigates the creep stability of the
Didymos primary by representing it as a cohesionless self-gravitating granular
aggregate subject to rotational acceleration. To achieve this goal, a
soft-sphere discrete element model (SSDEM) capable of simulating granular
systems in quasi-static states is implemented and a quasi-static spin-up
procedure is carried out. We devise three critical spin limits for the
simulated aggregates to indicate their critical states triggered by reshaping
and surface shedding, internal structural deformation, and shear failure,
respectively. The failure condition and mode, and shear strength of an
aggregate can all be inferred from the three critical spin limits. The effects
of arrangement and size distribution of constituent particles, bulk density,
spin-up path, and interparticle friction are numerically explored. The results
show that the shear strength of a spinning self-gravitating aggregate depends
strongly on both its internal configuration and material parameters, while its
failure mode and mechanism are mainly affected by its internal configuration.
Additionally, this study provides some constraints on the possible physical
properties of the Didymos primary based on observational data and proposes a
plausible formation mechanism for this binary system. With a bulk density
consistent with observational uncertainty and close to the maximum density
allowed for the asteroid, the Didymos primary in certain configurations can
remain geo-statically stable without including cohesion.

semi-parametric cascade that first aligns a parametric shape, then captures
more fine-grained deformations of an explicit shape. For the purpose of
learning shape updates at each cascade stage, we introduce a deep greedy neural

bars in galaxies with log (M_{star}/M_{sun}) >~ 10.4 have B/P bulges, while
only 12% of those in lower-mass galaxies do. (We find a similar dependence in

strong trends with other galaxy parameters -- e.g., Hubble type: 77% of S0-Sbc
bars, but only 15% of Sc-Sd bars, have B/P bulges -- but these appear to be
side effects of the correlations of these parameters with stellar mass. In
particular, despite indications from models that a high gas content can
suppress bar buckling, we find no evidence that the (atomic) gas mass ratio
M_{atomic}/M_{star} affects the presence of B/P bulges, once the stellar-mass
dependence is controlled for.
  The semi-major axes of B/P bulges range from one-quarter to three-quarters of

  Contour Extraction",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current face alignment algorithms can robustly find a set of landmarks along
face contour. However, the landmarks are sparse and lack curve details,
especially in chin and cheek areas where a lot of concave-convex bending
information exists. In this paper, we propose a local to global seam cutting
and integrating algorithm (L2GSCI) to extract continuous and accurate face
contour. Our method works in three steps with the help of a rough initial
curve. First, we sample small and overlapped squares along the initial curve.
Second, the seam cutting part of L2GSCI extracts a local seam in each square
region. Finally, the seam integrating part of L2GSCI connects all the redundant
seams together to form a continuous and complete face curve. Overall, the
proposed method is much more straightforward than existing face alignment
algorithms, but can achieve pixel-level continuous face curves rather than
discrete and sparse landmarks. Moreover, experiments on two face benchmark
datasets (i.e., LFPW and HELEN) show that our method can precisely reveal
concave-convex bending details of face contours, which has significantly
improved the performance when compared with the state-ofthe- art face alignment
approaches.

probability modulated (TPM) bounded smoothness condition into the general
CMAB-T framework, and show that many applications such as influence
maximization bandit and combinatorial cascading bandit satisfy this TPM
condition. As a result, we completely remove the factor of $1/p^*$ from the
regret bounds, achieving significantly better regret bounds for influence
maximization and cascading bandits than before. Finally, we provide lower bound
results showing that the factor $1/p^*$ is unavoidable for general CMAB-T
problems, suggesting that the TPM condition is crucial in removing this factor.

the non-convex optimization problem for each SBS is transformed into an
