emergence of traders' swarm behavior, even when each has a subjective
prediction of the market driven by a limit order book. Using a nonlinear Markov
model, we analyze the dynamics of traders who select a favorable order price
taking into account the waiting cost incurred by others. We find swarm behavior
emerges because of the delay in trader reactions to the market, and the
direction of the swarm is decided by the current market position and the
intensity of zero-intelligent random behavior, rather than subjective trader
predictions.

approach is based on a specific combination of reflection and synchronous
coupling of two solutions of the Langevin equation. It yields contractions in a
particular Wasserstein distance, and it provides rather precise bounds for
convergence to equilibrium at the borderline between the overdamped and the
underdamped regime. In particular, we are able to recover kinetic behavior in
terms of explicit lower bounds for the contraction rate. For example, for a
rescaled double-well potential with local minima at distance $a$, we obtain a
lower bound for the contraction rate of order $\Omega (a^{-1})$ provided the

graphene, as well as the TR broken Haldane model are explored. Spin singlet
superconducting order is studied where the $s$, $d+id$, and $d-id$ wave orders
are the irreducible representations of the hexagonal lattice. For small
quenches, the $d$-wave order parameter grows the fastest, a result also
expected when the system is in thermal equilibrium. For the TR symmetry
preserving case, the growth rate of the two $d$-wave orders is identical, while
the TR-broken case prefers one of the chiral $d$-wave orders over the other,
leading to a TR broken topological superconductor. As the interaction quench
becomes larger, a smooth crossover is found where eventually the growth rate of
the $s$-wave becomes the largest. Thus for large interaction quenches, the
$s$-wave is preferred over the $d$-wave for both TR preserving and TR broken
systems. This result is explained in terms of the high energy quasi-particles
responsible for the dynamics as the interaction quench amplitude grows. The
results are relevant for time-resolved measurements that can probe the symmetry

Laplacian (the adjoint of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator), as a map on the
boundary surface $\Gamma$ of a domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with conical points.
The spectrum of this operator directly reflects the well-posedness of related
transmission problems across $\Gamma$. In particular, if the domain is
understood as an inclusion with complex permittivity $\epsilon$, embedded in a
background medium with unit permittivity, then the polarizability tensor of the
domain is well-defined when $(\epsilon+1)/(\epsilon-1)$ belongs to the
resolvent set in energy norm. We study surfaces $\Gamma$ that have a finite
number of conical points featuring rotational symmetry. On the energy space, we
show that the essential spectrum consists of an interval. On $L^2(\Gamma)$,
i.e. for square-integrable boundary data, we show that the essential spectrum
consists of a countable union of curves, outside of which the Fredholm index
can be computed as a winding number with respect to the essential spectrum. We
provide explicit formulas, depending on the opening angles of the conical
points. We reinforce our study with very precise numerical experiments,
computing the energy space spectrum and the spectral measures of the
polarizability tensor in two different examples. Our results indicate that the
densities of the spectral measures may approach zero extremely rapidly in the
continuous part of the energy space spectrum.

during Run I of LHC. This proceedings are divided into two sections, the first
part will cover the search for the lepton number violating decay
${B}\rightarrow {\pi^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{-}}$ while the second part will cover the
search for a low mass dark boson in the decay $B^0 \rightarrow K^{*0}\chi$,
with $\chi \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ and $K^{*0} \rightarrow K^+\pi^-$. The data
used in these searches correspond to integrated luminosities of 1.0 and $2.0$
fb$^{-1}$ collected in $pp$ collisions at centre of mass energies of
$\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV in $pp$ collisions with the LHCb detector.

  Vassilevska Williams","Conditional Hardness for Sensitivity Problems","Appeared in ITCS'17",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years it has become popular to study dynamic problems in a
sensitivity setting: Instead of allowing for an arbitrary sequence of updates,
the sensitivity model only allows to apply batch updates of small size to the
original input data. The sensitivity model is particularly appealing since
recent strong conditional lower bounds ruled out fast algorithms for many
dynamic problems, such as shortest paths, reachability, or subgraph
connectivity.
  In this paper we prove conditional lower bounds for sensitivity problems. For
example, we show that under the Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture
combinatorial algorithms cannot compute the (4/3 - {\epsilon})-approximate
diameter of an undirected unweighted dense graph with truly subcubic
preprocessing time and truly subquadratic update/query time. This result is
surprising since in the static setting it is not clear whether a reduction from
BMM to diameter is possible. We further show under the BMM conjecture that many
problems, such as reachability or approximate shortest paths, cannot be solved
faster than by recomputation from scratch even after only one or two edge
insertions. We give more lower bounds under the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis and the All Pairs Shortest Paths Conjecture. Many of our lower
bounds also hold for static oracle data structures where no sensitivity is
required. Finally, we give the first algorithm for the (1 +
{\epsilon})-approximate radius, diameter, and eccentricity problems in directed
or undirected unweighted graphs in case of single edges failures. The algorithm
has a truly subcubic running time for graphs with a truly subquadratic number
of edges; it is tight w.r.t. the conditional lower bounds we obtain.

frequency-division multiplexing (NOFDM) scheme for visible light communications

cosine transform (IFrCT)/FrCT. Different to the common fractional Fourier
transform-based NOFDM (FrFT-NOFDM) signal, FrCT-based NOFDM (FrCT-NOFDM) signal
is real-valued which can be directly applied to the VLC systems without the
expensive upconversion. Thus, FrCT-NOFDM is more suitable for the
cost-sensitive VLC systems. Meanwhile, under the same transmission rate,
FrCT-NOFDM signal occupies smaller bandwidth compared to OFDM signal. When the
bandwidth compression factor $\alpha$ is set to $0.8$, $20\%$ bandwidth saving
can be obtained. Therefore, FrCT-NOFDM has higher spectral efficiency and
suffers less high-frequency distortion compared to OFDM, which benefits the
bandwidth-limited VLC systems. As the simulation results show, bit error rate
(BER) performance of FrCT-NOFDM with $\alpha$ of $0.9$ or $0.8$ is better than
that of OFDM. Moreover, FrCT-NOFDM has a superior security performance. In
conclusion, FrCT-NOFDM shows great potential for application in the future VLC

earlier. The enhancement is explained by the counter-convective motion of the
dye solution in response to the diffusiophoretic motion of the nanoparticles
towards a higher concentration of the dye. The velocity of the dye front agrees
with the theoretical estimate obtained from the diffusiophoretic velocity of
alumina nanoparticles in a gradient of fluorescein di-sodium electrolyte

variability amplitudes for most of nights are less than 10\% and four nights
more than 20\%. When considering the nights with time spans $>4$ hours, the
value of duty cycle (DC) is 14.17 per cent. Over the twelve years, the overall
magnitude and color index variabilities are $\bigtriangleup I=0^{\rm m}.67$,
$\bigtriangleup R=0^{\rm m}.72$, $\bigtriangleup V=0^{\rm m}.68$, and
$\bigtriangleup (V-R)=0^{\rm m}.25$ respectively. The largest clear IDV has an

3C 273 and appears at different flux levels on intraday timescales. The BWB
trend exists for short-term timescales and intermediate-term timescales but
different timescales have different correlations. There is no BWB trend for our
whole time-series data sets. A significant anti-correlation between BWB trend

white dwarfs (ELM WDs, mass $M \lesssim 0.17\, M_\odot$) which likely have WD
companions, this paper discusses binary formation models for these systems.
Formation of an ELM WD by unstable mass transfer (MT) or a common envelope (CE)
event is unlikely. Stable Roche-lobe overflow with conservative MT produces
only $M \gtrsim 0.2\, M_\odot$. This paper discusses the formation of ELM WD
using angular momentum losses by magnetic braking. The initially more massive
star becomes the companion WD through a CE event. The initially less massive
star becomes the ELM WD as an evolved donor in a Cataclysmic Variable binary.
Evolutionary models are constructed using the Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), with ELM WD progenitors in the range
$M_d=1.0-1.5\, M_\odot$ and WD companions in the range $M_{\rm a} \simeq
0.4-0.9\, M_\odot$. A prescription to reduce magnetic braking for thin surface
convection zones is included. Upon the thinning of the evolved donor's
envelope, the donor star shrinks out of contact and MT ceases, revealing the
ELM WD. Systems with small masses have previously been suggested as possible AM
CVN's. Systems with large masses, up to the limit $M \simeq 0.18\, M_\odot$ at
which shell flashes occur on the WD cooling track, will tend to expand out to
orbital periods $P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 15\, {\rm hr}$. In between this range, ELM
WD may become pulsators both as pre-WD and on the WD cooling track. Brickhill's
criterion for convective mode driving is used to estimate the location of the
blue edge of the g-mode instability strip.

entitlements. Fair allocation has been the subject of many studies in both
divisible and indivisible settings. Our emphasis is on the case where the goods
are indivisible and agents have unequal entitlements. This problem is a
generalization of the work by Procaccia and Wang wherein the agents are assumed
to be symmetric with respect to their entitlements. Although Procaccia and Wang
show an almost fair (constant approximation) allocation exists in their
setting, our main result is in sharp contrast to their observation. We show
that, in some cases with $n$ agents, no allocation can guarantee better than
$1/n$ approximation of a fair allocation when the entitlements are not
necessarily equal. Furthermore, we devise a simple algorithm that ensures a
$1/n$ approximation guarantee. Our second result is for a restricted version of
the problem where the valuation of every agent for each good is bounded by the
total value he wishes to receive in a fair allocation. Although this assumption
might seem w.l.o.g, we show it enables us to find a $1/2$ approximation fair
allocation via a greedy algorithm. Finally, we run some experiments on
real-world data and show that, in practice, a fair allocation is likely to
exist. We also support our experiments by showing positive results for two
stochastic variants of the problem, namely stochastic agents and stochastic
items.

on an equal footing. The sum of these currents is the source of the high-order
harmonic radiation, and does not depend on the particular electromagnetic gauge

$\mathbb{R}^d$ based on observations of points uniformly distributed over the

a class is assumed to be intersection stable. No further hypotheses on the
boundary of the set are imposed; in particular, the convex sets and the
so-called weakly-convex sets are covered by the framework. The approach rests
upon a homogeneous Poisson point process model. We introduce the so-called
wrapping hull, a generalization of the convex hull, and prove that it is a
sufficient and complete statistic. The proposed estimator of the volume is
simply the volume of the wrapping hull scaled with an appropriate factor. It is
shown to be consistent for all classes of sets satisfying the axiom and mimics
an unbiased estimator with uniformly minimal variance. The construction and
proofs hinge upon an interplay between probabilistic and geometric arguments.
The tractability of the framework is numerically confirmed in a variety of
examples.

transformation and a positive-operator valued measure (POVM), the receiver can
recreate the state of the original qubit. An important advantage of the

to study the growth and decay of the enstrophy and helicity. Negative helicity
density ($h<0$) plays several roles. First, sheets of oppositely-signed
helicity dissipation of equal magnitude on either side of the maximum of the
enstrophy dissipation allow the global helicity ${\cal H}$ to be preserved
through the first reconnection, as suggested theoretically (Laing et al 2015)
and observed experimentally (Scheeler et al. 2014). Next, to maintain the
growth of the enstrophy and positive helicity within the trefoil while ${\cal
H}$ is preserved, $h<0$ forms in the outer parts of the trefoil so long as the
periodic boundaries do not interfere. To prevent that, the domain size $\ell$
is increased as the viscosity $\nu\to0$. Combined, this allows two sets of
trefoils to form a new scaling regime with linearly decreasing
$(\sqrt{\nu}Z(t))^{-1/2}$ up to common $\nu$-independent times $t_x$ that the
graphics show is when the first reconnection ends. During this phase there is
good correspondence between the evolution of the simulated vortices and the
reconnecting experimental trefoil of Kleckner and Irvine (2013) when time is
scaled by their respective nonlinear timescales $t_f$. The timescales $t_f$ are
based upon by the radii $r_f$ of the trefoils and their circulations $\Gamma$,
so long as the strong camber of the experimental hydrofoil models is used to
correct the published experimental circulations $\Gamma$ that use only the
flat-plate approximation.

Gradient Descent (SGD), and employ it to develop novel generalization bounds.
This is in contrast to previous distribution-free algorithmic stability results
for SGD which depend on the worst-case constants. By virtue of the
data-dependent argument, our bounds provide new insights into learning with SGD
on convex and non-convex problems. In the convex case, we show that the bound
on the generalization error depends on the risk at the initialization point. In
the non-convex case, we prove that the expected curvature of the objective
function around the initialization point has crucial influence on the
generalization error. In both cases, our results suggest a simple data-driven
strategy to stabilize SGD by pre-screening its initialization. As a corollary,
our results allow us to show optimistic generalization bounds that exhibit fast
convergence rates for SGD subject to a vanishing empirical risk and low noise

relative astrometry across its 500~Mpix, 3 deg^2 science field of view, and
across 4 years of operation. This is done using internal comparisons of ~4x10^7
measurements of high-S/N stellar images obtained in repeat visits to fields of
moderate stellar density, with the telescope dithered to move the sources
around the array. An empirical astrometric model includes terms for: optical
distortions; stray electric fields in the CCD detectors; chromatic terms in the
instrumental and atmospheric optics; shifts in CCD relative positions of up to
~10 um when the DECam temperature cycles; and low-order distortions to each
exposure from changes in atmospheric refraction and telescope alignment. Errors
in this astrometric model are dominated by stochastic variations with typical
amplitudes of 10-30 mas (in a 30 s exposure) and 5-10 arcmin coherence length,
plausibly attributed to Kolmogorov-spectrum atmospheric turbulence. The size of
these atmospheric distortions is not closely related to the seeing. Given an
astrometric reference catalog at density ~0.7 arcmin^{-2}, e.g. from Gaia, the
typical atmospheric distortions can be interpolated to 7 mas RMS accuracy (for
30 s exposures) with 1 arcmin coherence length for residual errors. Remaining
detectable error contributors are 2-4 mas RMS from unmodelled stray electric
fields in the devices, and another 2-4 mas RMS from focal plane shifts between
camera thermal cycles. Thus the astrometric solution for a single DECam
exposure is accurate to 3-6 mas (0.02 pixels, or 300 nm) on the focal plane,
plus the stochastic atmospheric distortion.

compact detectors operating at surface level and close to a nuclear reactor.
This paper presents a new detector concept based on a composite solid
scintillator technology. The detector target uses cubes of polyvinyltoluene
interleaved with $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) phosphor screens to detect the products of the
inverse beta decay reaction. A multi-tonne detector system built from these
individual cells can provide precise localisation of scintillation signals,
making efficient use of the detector volume. Monte Carlo simulations indicate
that a neutron capture efficiency of over 70% is achievable with a sufficient
number of $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens per cube and that an appropriate segmentation
enables a measurement of the positron energy which is not limited by gamma-ray
leakage. First measurements of a single cell indicate that a very good
neutron-gamma discrimination and high neutron detection efficiency can be
obtained with adequate triggering techniques. The light yield from positron
signals has been measured, showing that an energy resolution of
14%/$\sqrt{E({\mathrm{MeV}})}$ is achievable with high uniformity. A
preliminary neutrino signal analysis has been developed, using selection
criteria for pulse shape, energy, time structure and energy spatial
distribution and showing that an antineutrino efficiency of 40% can be
achieved. It also shows that the fine segmentation of the detector can be used
to significantly decrease both correlated and accidental backgrounds.

bootstrapping to assess a linear property model linking the 57Fe Moessbauer

set of 44 molecular iron compounds. The contact electron density is calculated
with twelve density functionals across Jacob's ladder (PWLDA, BP86, BLYP, PW91,
PBE, M06-L, TPSS, B3LYP, B3PW91, PBE0, M06, TPSSh). We provide systematic-error

uncertainties of 0.06-0.08 mm/s and 0.04-0.05 mm/s, respectively, the latter
being close to the average experimental uncertainty of 0.02 mm/s. Furthermore,
we show that both model parameters and prediction uncertainty depend
significantly on the composition and number of reference data points.
Accordingly, we suggest that rankings of density functionals based on
performance measures (e.g., the coefficient of correlation, r2, or the
root-mean-square error, RMSE) should not be inferred from a single data set.
This study presents the first statistically rigorous calibration analysis for

model (DIAMETER-TREE for short) introduced by Wirth and Steffan (2001). In this
problem, given an undirected edge-colored graph $G$, reload costs on a path
arise at a node where the path uses consecutive edges of different colors. The
objective is to find a spanning tree of $G$ of minimum diameter with respect to
the reload costs. We initiate a systematic study of the parameterized
complexity of the DIAMETER-TREE problem by considering the following
parameters: the cost of a solution, and the treewidth and the maximum degree
$\Delta$ of the input graph. We prove that DIAMETER-TREE is para-NP-hard for
any combination of two of these three parameters, and that it is FPT
parameterized by the three of them. We also prove that the problem can be
solved in polynomial time on cactus graphs. This result is somehow surprising
since we prove DIAMETER-TREE to be NP-hard on graphs of treewidth two, which is
best possible as the problem can be trivially solved on forests. When the
reload costs satisfy the triangle inequality, Wirth and Steffan (2001) proved
that the problem can be solved in polynomial time on graphs with $\Delta = 3$,
and Galbiati (2008) proved that it is NP-hard if $\Delta = 4$. Our results
show, in particular, that without the requirement of the triangle inequality,
the problem is NP-hard if $\Delta = 3$, which is also best possible. Finally,
in the case where the reload costs are polynomially bounded by the size of the
input graph, we prove that DIAMETER-TREE is in XP and W[1]-hard parameterized
by the treewidth plus $\Delta$.

therefore a viable future pathway to quantum computation. We first detail how
broadband PDC processes lead directly to a series of orthogonal supermodes that
are linear combinations of the original frequency modes. We then calculate the
total squeezing of the multimode entangled states when they are assumed to be
measured by an ideal homodyne detection in which all supermodes of the states
are detected by an optimally shaped local oscillator (LO) pulse. For
comparison, squeezing of the same entangled states are calculated when measured
by a lower-complexity homodyne detection scheme that exploits an unshaped LO
pulse. Such calculations illustrate the cost, in the context of squeezing, of
moving from higher complexity (harder to implement) homodyne detection to
lower-complexity (easier-to-implement) homodyne detection. Finally, by studying
the degradation in squeezing of the supermodes under photonic loss, multimode
entangled state evolution through an attenuation channel is determined. The
results reported here push us towards a fuller understanding of the real-world

and its geospatially contiguous neighbors and rank ordered diseases in terms of
their degree of geospatial variation as quantified by the NB2 method.
  We show that this method yields results in good agreement with established

Moreover, the NB2 method can be tuned to identify both large area and small
area geospatial variations. This method also applies more generally in any
parameter space that can be partitioned to consist of regions and their
neighbors.

result in more reliable evaluation of viewpoint quality. Specifically, we
collect a set of photographs for each of 15 world famous architectures as well

out through an image-model registration process, after which a newly proposed
viewpoint clustering strategy is exploited to validate users' viewpoint

perform viewpoint recommendation by learning from both 2D and 3D features using
a specifically designed SVM-2K multi-view learner, achieving superior
performance over using solely 2D or 3D features. We show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach through extensive experiments. The experiments also
demonstrate that our system can be used to recommend viewpoints for rendering

achieving sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key
difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the
agent to optimize. Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to
overcome this problem. Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend
to require that demonstrations are supplied in the first-person: the agent is
provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it
should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited
by the relatively hard problem of collecting first-person demonstrations.
Humans address this problem by learning from third-person demonstrations: they
observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same
task themselves.
  In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation
learning. Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a
simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a
teacher achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and
unsupervised refers to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person
demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and
student states. Our methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain
confusion can be utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial
during the training process. To validate our approach, we report successful
experiments on learning from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain,
a reacher domain, and inverted pendulum.

from one layer to the next one of such tree. We call this problem Layer
Dissemination. We study Layer Dissemination under a generalized model of
interference, called affectance. The affectance model subsumes previous models,
such as Radio Network and Signal to Inteference-plus-Noise Ratio. We present
randomized and deterministic protocols for Layer Dissemination. These protocols
are based on a combinatorial object that we call Affectance-selective Families.
Our approach combines an engineering solution with theoretical guarantees. That
is, we provide a method to characterize the network with a global measure of
affectance based on measurements of interference in the specific deployment
area. Then, our protocols distributedly produce an ad-hoc transmissions
schedule for dissemination. In the randomized protocol only the network
characterization is needed, whereas the deterministic protocol requires full
knowledge of affectance. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on
schedule length. We also present simulations of a real network-deployment area
contrasting the performance of our randomized protocol, which takes into
account affectance, against previous work for interference models that ignore
some physical constraints. The striking improvement in performance shown by our
simulations show the importance of utilizing a more physically-accurate model

ramified cover of an algebraic variety $\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$ over a

arithmetic structure: the Frobenius action on the fiber over $x$. For example,
in the case of the Vieta cover of polynomials over $F_q$ this structure
describes a polynomial's irreducible decomposition type.
  Furthermore, the distribution of these Frobenius actions is encoded in the
cohomology of $\widetilde{X}$ via the Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula.
This note presents a version of the trace formula that is suited for studying
the distribution in the context of representation stability: for certain
sequences of varieties $(\widetilde{X}_n)$ the cohomology, and therefore the
distribution of the Frobenius actions, stabilizes in a precise sense.
  We conclude by fully working out the example of the Vieta cover of the

decompositions on cosets of Young subgroups of the symmetric group, which might

curvature $k=0$ of four dimensional Gauss-Bonnet models are characterized. The
main assumption is that the scalar field $\phi$ which is coupled to the
Gauss-Bonnet term has no potential [50]-[51]. Some singular and some eternal
solutions are described. The evolution of the universe is given in terms of a
curve $\gamma=(H(\phi), \phi)$ which is the solution of a polynomial equation
$P(H^2, \phi)=0$ with $\phi$ dependent coefficients. In addition, it is shown
that the initial conditions in these models put several restrictions on the
evolution. For instance, an universe initially contracting will be contracting
always for future times and an universe that is expanding was always expanding
at past times. Thus, there are no cyclic cosmological solutions for this model.
These results are universal, that is, independent on the form of the coupling
$f(\phi)$ between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet term. In addition, a
proof that at a turning point $\dot{\phi}\to0$ a singularity necessarily
emerges is presented. This is valid unless the Hubble constant $H\to 0$ at this
point. This proof is based on the Raychaudhuri equation for the model. The
description presented here is in part inspired in the works [32]-[34]. However,
the mathematical methods that are implemented are complementary of those in
these references, and they may be helpful for study more complicated situations
in a future.

studied in different mean-field models. Recently, there is a controversy about
whether the $\Lambda$ hyperon is more tightly bound in the normal deformed (ND)
states than that in the superdeformed (SD) states.[Purpose] This article is
aimed to provide a beyond-mean-field study of the low-lying states of
hypernuclei with shape coexistence and to shed some light on the
controversy.[Method] The models of relativistic mean-field and beyond based on
a relativistic point-coupling energy functional are adopted to study the
low-lying states of both $^{37}_\Lambda$Ar and $^{36}$Ar. The wavefunctions of
low-lying states are constructed as a superposition of a set of relativistic
mean-field states with different values of quadrupole deformation parameter.
The projections onto both particle number and angular momentum are
considered.[Results] The $\Lambda$ binding energies in both ND and SD states of
$^{37}_{\Lambda}$Ar are studied in the case of the $\Lambda$ hyperon occupying
$s, p$, or $d$ state in the spherical limit, respectively. For comparison, four
sets of nucleon-hyperon point-coupling interactions are used respectively.
Moreover, the spectra of low-lying states in $^{36}$Ar and
$^{37}_{\Lambda_s}$Ar are calculated based on the same nuclear energy density
functional. The results indicate that the SD states exist in
$^{37}_{\Lambda}$Ar for all the four effective interactions. Furthermore, the
$\Lambda_s$ reduces the quadrupole collectivity of ND states to a greater
extent than that of SD states. For $^{37}_{\Lambda}$Ar, the beyond-mean-field
decreases the $\Lambda_s$ binding energy of the SD state by 0.17 MeV, but it
almost has no effect on that of the ND state. [Conclusions] In
$^{37}_{\Lambda_s}$Ar, the $\Lambda_p$ and $\Lambda_d$ binding energies of the

reproducing kernels to define a closed-form kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD)
computable by summing kernel evaluations across pairs of sample points. We
develop a theory of weak convergence for KSDs based on Stein's method,
demonstrate that commonly used KSDs fail to detect non-convergence even for
Gaussian targets, and show that kernels with slowly decaying tails provably
determine convergence for a large class of target distributions. The resulting
convergence-determining KSDs are suitable for comparing biased, exact, and
deterministic sample sequences and simpler to compute and parallelize than
alternative Stein discrepancies. We use our tools to compare biased samplers,
select sampler hyperparameters, and improve upon existing KSD approaches to
one-sample hypothesis testing and sample quality improvement.

multimodal content, we must also account for context: timing effects, community
preferences, and social factors (e.g., which authors are already popular) also
affect the amount of feedback and reaction that social-media posts receive. In

encourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content

methodology to enhance the process of retrieving data from a DDW as results are

materialized views, the level of dynamicity that can be provided at the MV
access layer is restricted. As a result, the collection of materialized views
is not compatible with ever-changing reporting requirements. It is important
that the MV collection is consistent with current and upcoming queries. The
solution to the above problem must consider the following aspects: (a) MV must
be matched against an OLAP query in order to recognize whether the MV can
answer the query, (b) enable scalability in the MV collection, an intuitive
mechanism to prune it and retrieve closely matching MVs must be incorporated,
(c) MV collection must be able to evolve in correspondence to the regularly

to explore these aspects and provide a well-rounded solution for the MV access

beginning of its quiescence. A theoretical model with crustal heating indicates
that an additional shallow heat source of Qshallow > 6 MeV per accreted nucleon
is required in the shallow outer crust with respect to the deeper star crust by
considering the observed decline in accretion rate at the end of outburst.
However, the physical source of this shallow heating is still unclear. In the
present investigation, we performed stellar evolutionary calculations, adopting
the effects of outburst behavior of the accretion rate. As a consequence, we
find that the quiescent light curve of MAXI J0556-332 can be well explained by
the nuclear energy generation due to the hot CNO cycle.

interactions between the radio jets and their intra-cluster environment, the
general consensus on the morphology origin of head-tail sources is that radio
jets are bent by violent intra-cluster weather. We demonstrate in this paper
that such strong interactions provide a great opportunity to study the jet
properties and also the dynamics of intra-cluster medium (ICM). By
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we analyse the detailed
bending process of a magnetically dominated jet, based on the magnetic tower
jet model. We use stratified atmospheres modulated by wind/shock to mimic the
violent intra-cluster weather. Core sloshing is found to be inevitable during
the wind-cluster core interaction, which induces significant shear motion and
could finally drive ICM turbulence around the jet, making it difficult for jet
to survive. We perform detailed comparison between the behaviour of pure
hydrodynamical jets and magnetic tower jet, and find that the jet-lobe
morphology could not survive against the violent disruption in all of our pure
hydrodynamical jet models. On the other hand, the head-tail morphology is well
reproduced by using a magnetic tower jet model bent by wind, in which
hydrodynamical instabilities are naturally suppressed and the jet could always
keep its integrity under the protection of its internal magnetic fields.
Finally, we also check the possibility for jet bending by shock only. We find
that shock could not bend jet significantly, so could not be expected to
explain the observed long tails in head-tail radio galaxies.

Poisson's ratio of $s$-triazine is half the value to that of graphene.
Additionally, the calculated values of the two critical strains (elastic and

that for heptazine which was calculated using MD simulations in the literature.
It is also demonstrated that $s$-triazine sheet can withstand larger tension in
the plastic region. These results established a stable mechanical property for

bi-axial tensile strain within the harmonic elastic region. The reduced steric
repulse of the lone pairs ($\mathrm{p}_x$-, $\mathrm {p}_y$-) causes the

of Mercury remains poorly understood. We investigated terrestrial planet
formation by performing 110 high-resolution N-body simulation runs using more
than 100 embryos and 6000 disk planetesimals representing a primordial
protoplanetary disk. To investigate the formation of Mercury, these simulations
considered an inner region of the disk at 0.2-0.5 au (the Mercury region) and
disks with and without mass enhancements beyond the ice line location, aIL, in
the disk, where aIL = 1.5, 2.25, and 3.0 au were tested. Although Venus and
Earth analogs (considering both orbits and masses) successfully formed in the
majority of the runs, Mercury analogs were obtained in only nine runs. Mars
analogs were also similarly scarce. Our Mercury analogs concentrated at orbits
with a ~ 0.27-0.34 au, relatively small eccentricities/inclinations, and median
mass m ~ 0.2 Earth masses. In addition, we found that our Mercury analogs
acquired most of their final masses from embryos/planetesimals initially
located between 0.2 and ~1-1.5 au within 10 Myr, while the remaining mass came
from a wider region up to ~3 au at later times. Although the ice line was
negligible in the formation of planets located in the Mercury region, it
enriched all terrestrial planets with water. Indeed, Mercury analogs showed a
wide range of water mass fractions at the end of terrestrial planet formation.

the GDR lineshape is fragmented into two prominent peaks at high J ($\sim$

consortium, in which the public outsources the construction and the maintenance
of an equipment (hospital, university, prison...). One drawback of this
contract is that the public may not be able to observe the effort of the
consortium but only its impact on the social welfare of the project. We aim to
characterize the optimal contract for a PPP in this setting of asymmetric
information between the two parties. This leads to a stochastic control under
partial information and it is also related to principal-agent problems with
moral hazard. Considering a wider set of information for the public and using
martingale arguments in the spirit of Sannikov, the optimization problem can be
reduced to a standard stochastic control problem, that is solved numerically.
We then prove that for the optimal contract, the effort of the consortium is
explicitly characterized. In particular, it is shown that the optimal rent is
not a linear function of the effort, contrary to some models of the economic
literature on PPP contracts.

In most cases, it requires a larger number of data to train a robust deep
learning model, which contains a lot of parameters to fit training data.
However, both data of user ratings and social networks are facing critical
sparse problem, which makes it not easy to train a robust deep neural network
model. Towards this problem, we propose a novel Correlative Denoising
Autoencoder (CoDAE) method by taking correlations between users with multiple
roles into account to learn robust representations from sparse inputs of
ratings and social networks for recommendation. We develop the CoDAE model by
utilizing three separated autoencoders to learn user features with roles of
rater, truster and trustee, respectively. Especially, on account of that each
input unit of user vectors with roles of truster and trustee is corresponding
to a particular user, we propose to utilize shared parameters to learn common
information of the units that corresponding to same users. Moreover, we propose
a related regularization term to learn correlations between user features that
learnt by the three subnetworks of CoDAE model. We further conduct a series of
experiments to evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets for Top-N
recommendation task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on rank-sensitive metrics of MAP

trapped in optical (or magnetic) lattices appear to be a promising platform for
the realization of a scalable quantum computer. Two-qubit conditional gates
between nearest-neighbor qubits in the array can be implemented by exploiting
the Rydberg blockade mechanism, as was shown by D. Jaksch et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 85, 2208 (2000)]. However, the energy shift due to dipole-dipole
interactions causing the blockade falls off rapidly with the interatomic
distance and protocols based on direct Rydberg blockade typically fail to
operate between atoms separated by more than one lattice site. In this work, we
propose an extension of the protocol of Jaksch \emph{et al.}\ for controlled-Z
and controlled-NOT gates which works in the general case where the qubits are
not nearest-neighbor in the array. Our proposal relies on the Rydberg
excitation hopping along a chain of ancilla non-coding atoms connecting the
qubits on which the gate is to be applied. The dependence of the gate fidelity
on the number of ancilla atoms, the blockade strength and the decay rates of
the Rydberg states is investigated. A comparison between our implementation of
distant controlled-NOT gate and one based on a sequence of nearest-neighbor
two-qubit gates is also provided.

method relies on a recent procedure which allows to compute such approximations
online, i.e. as the observations are received, and with a computational
complexity growing linearly with the number of Monte Carlo samples. This online
smoother cannot be used directly in the case of partially observed stochastic
differential equations since the transition density of the latent data is
usually unknown. We prove that a similar algorithm may still be defined for
partially observed continuous processes by replacing this unknown quantity by
an unbiased estimator obtained for instance using general Poisson estimators.

unprecedented opportunity to quantify the geometry and topology of the cosmic
web, in particular in the vicinity of lensing clusters. Aims. Understanding the
connectivity of the cosmic web with unbiased mass tracers, such as weak
lensing, is of prime importance to probe the underlying cosmology, seek
dynamical signatures of dark matter, and quantify environmental effects on
galaxy formation. Methods. Mock catalogues of galaxy clusters are extracted
from the N-body PLUS simulation. For each cluster, the aperture multipolar
moments of the convergence are calculated in two annuli (inside and outside the
virial radius). By stacking their modulus, a statistical estimator is built to
characterise the angular mass distribution around clusters. The moments are
compared to predictions from perturbation theory and spherical collapse.
Results. The main weakly chromatic excess of multipolar power on large scales
is understood as arising from the contraction of the primordial cosmic web
driven by the growing potential well of the cluster. Besides this boost, the
quadrupole prevails in the cluster (ellipsoidal) core, while at the outskirts,
harmonic distortions are spread on small angular modes, and trace the
non-linear sharpening of the filamentary structures. Predictions for the signal
amplitude as a function of the cluster-centric distance, mass, and redshift are
presented. The prospects of measuring this signal are estimated for current and
future lensing data sets. Conclusions. The Euclid mission should provide all
the necessary information for studying the cosmic evolution of the connectivity
of the cosmic web around lensing clusters using multipolar moments and probing
unique signatures of, for example, baryons and warm dark matter.

$N$ and i.i.d. arrival rates $X_1, \dots, X_N$, we focus on the evaluation of
$P_N(A)$, the probability that the scaled number of arrivals exceeds $NA$.
Relying on elementary techniques, we derive the exact asymptotics of $P_N(A)$:
For $a< \frac{1}{3}$ and $a > 3$ we identify (in closed-form) a function
$\tilde{P}_N(A)$ such that $P_N(A) / P_N(A)$ tends to $1$ as $N \to \infty$.
For $a \in [\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ and $a\in [2, 3)$ we find a partial
solution in terms of an asymptotic lower bound. For the special case that the
$X_i$s are gamma distributed, we establish the exact asymptotics across all $a>
0$. In addition, we set up an asymptotically efficient importance sampling
procedure that produces reliable estimates at low computational cost. The
second part of the paper considers an infinite-server queue assumed to be fed
by such a mixed Poisson arrival process. Applying a scaling similar to the one
in the definition of $P_N(A)$, we focus on the asymptotics of the probability
that the number of clients in the system exceeds $NA$. The resulting
approximations can be useful in the context of staffing. Our numerical
experiments show that, astoundingly, the required staffing level can actually
decrease when service times are more variable.

exhibited by the XXZ model, and $\sigma_c = 2$ in the gapless XY ferromagnetic
phase), sharing the same properties as those of finite-range interactions
($\alpha=\infty$); 2) a long-range regime $\alpha < d$, sharing the same
properties as those of the infinite-range interactions ($\alpha=0$) in the
thermodynamic limit; and 3) a most intriguing medium-range regime for $d <
\alpha < d+\sigma_c$, continuously interpolating between the finite-range and
the infinite-range behavior. The latter regime is characterized by elementary
excitations with a long-wavelength dispersion relation $\omega \approx \Delta_g

exhibiting a continuously varying dynamical exponent $z = (\alpha - d) /

control the scaling of fluctuations, the decay of correlations, and a universal
sub-dominant term in the entanglement entropy, leading to a very rich palette
of behaviors for ground-state quantum correlations beyond what is known for

$\varepsilon$ of dust grains and two coefficients - $\bar b_1$ and $\bar b_2$,

Rayleigh scattering slope in the optical. We conducted an optical transmission
spectroscopy project to assess the impacts of stellar activity and to determine
whether or not GJ 3470b hosts a hydrogen-rich gas envelop. Methods. We observed
three transits with the low-resolution OSIRIS spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran
Telescopio Canarias, and one transit with the high-resolution UVES spectrograph
at the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope. Results. From the high-resolution data, we
find that the difference of the Ca II H+K lines in- and out-of-transit is only
0.67 +/- 0.22%, and determine a magnetic filling factor of about 10-15%. From
the low-resolution data, we present the first optical transmission spectrum in
the 435-755 nm band, which shows a slope consistent with Rayleigh scattering.
Conclusions. After exploring the potential impacts of stellar activity in our
observations, we confirm that Rayleigh scattering in an extended
hydrogen/helium atmosphere is currently the best explanation. Further
high-precision observations that simultaneously cover optical and infrared
bands are required to answer whether or not clouds and hazes exist at

as to maximize their growth. Here, we generalize this framework to single cell
level using maximum entropy models from statistical physics. We define and
compute, for the core metabolism of Escherichia coli, a joint distribution over
all fluxes that yields the experimentally observed growth rate. This solution,
containing FBA as a limiting case, provides a better match to the measured
fluxes in the wild type and several mutants. We find that E. coli metabolism is
close to, but not at, the optimality assumed by FBA. Moreover, our model makes
a wide range of predictions: (i) on flux variability, its regulation, and flux
correlations across individual cells; (ii) on the relative importance of
stoichiometric constraints vs. growth rate optimization; (iii) on quantitative
scaling relations for singe-cell growth rate distributions. We validate these
scaling predictions using data from individual bacterial cells grown in a
microfluidic device at different sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations.
Under mild dynamical assumptions, fluctuation-response relations further
predict the autocorrelation timescale in growth data and growth rate adaptation
times following an environmental perturbation.

out globally in recent years. The mass popularity is primarily driven by
cost-effective distribution of content, also giving rise to piracy. An end user
(buyer/peer) of a P2P content distribution system does not want to reveal
his/her identity during a transaction with a content owner (merchant), whereas
the merchant does not want the buyer to further distribute the content
illegally. To date, different P2P distribution systems have been proposed that
provide copyright and privacy protection at a cost of high computational burden
at the merchants and/or at the buyer's end and thus, making these systems
impractical. In this paper, we propose PSUM, a P2P content distribution system
which allows efficient distribution of large-sized multimedia content while
preserving the security and privacy of merchants and buyers. The security of
PSUM is ensured by using an asymmetric fingerprinting protocol based on
collusion-resistant codes. In addition, PSUM enables buyers to obtain digital
contents anonymously, but this anonymity can be revoked as soon as he/she is
found guilty of copyright violation. The paper presents a thorough performance
analysis of PSUM, through different experiments and simulations, and also

  Impedance Tomography","16 pages",,,,"math.AP q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides functional images of an
electrical conductivity distribution inside the human body. Since the 1980s,
many potential clinical applications have arisen using inexpensive portable EIT
devices. EIT acquires multiple trans-impedance measurements across the body
from an array of surface electrodes around a chosen imaging slice. The
conductivity image reconstruction from the measured data is a fundamentally
ill-posed inverse problem notoriously vulnerable to measurement noise and
artifacts. Most available methods invert the ill-conditioned sensitivity or
Jacobian matrix using a regularized least-squares data-fitting technique. Their
performances rely on the regularization parameter, which controls the trade-off
between fidelity and robustness. For clinical applications of EIT, it would be
desirable to develop a method achieving consistent performance over various
uncertain data, regardless of the choice of the regularization parameter. Based
on the analysis of the structure of the Jacobian matrix, we propose a
fidelity-embedded regularization (FER) method and a motion artifact removal
filter. Incorporating the Jacobian matrix in the regularization process, the
new FER method with the motion artifact removal filter offers stable
reconstructions of high-fidelity images from noisy data by taking a very large
regularization parameter value. The proposed method showed practical merits in
experimental studies of chest EIT imaging.

3FGL unassociated sources (case A). Second, to determine the BL Lac or FSRQ
nature of the blazar candidates, including those determined as such in this
work and the blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) that are already present
in the 3FGL catalogue (case B).
  For this purpose, multivariate classifiers were trained using samples of
labelled sources with no caution flag from the 3FGL catalogue and carefully
chosen discriminant parameters. The decisions of the classifiers were combined
in order to obtain a high level of source identification along with well
controlled numbers of expected false associations. Specifically for case A,
dedicated classifications were generated for high and low galactic latitude
sources, in addition, the application of classifiers to samples of sources with
caution flag was considered separately, and specific performance metrics were
estimated.
  We obtained a sample of 595 blazar candidates among the unassociated sources

observational data, including astrometry and physical properties. We selected
25 asteroids with the best determined orbital elements. We studied their
dynamical evolution in the past and future for $\pm$ 100 My ($\pm$ 1 Gy for
three particular cases).
  We first used orbit determination and cloning to produce swarms of test
particles. These swarms were then input into long-term numerical integrations
and orbital elements were averaged. Next, we collected the available thermal
properties of our objects and used them in an enhanced dynamical model with
Yarkovsky forces. We also used a gravitational model for comparison. Finally,
we estimated the median lifetimes of 25 asteroids.
  We found three objects whose retrograde orbits were stable with a dynamical
lifetime $\tau \sim 10 \div 100$ My. A large portion of the objects studied
displayed smaller values of $\tau$ ($\tau \sim 1$ My). In addition, we studied
the possible influence of the Yarkovsky effect on our results.
  We found that the Yarkovsky effect can have a significant influence on the
lifetimes of asteroids in retrograde orbits. Due to the presence of this
effect, it is possible that the median lifetimes of these objects are extended.
Additionally, the changes in orbital elements, caused by Yarkovsky forces,
appear to depend on the integration direction. To explain this more precisely,
the same model based on new physical parameters, determined from future
observations, will be required.

yields a generalisation to higher-dimensional systems of the relation $T_2 \leq

preservation and transfer. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between
ergodicity and the ability of Markovian dynamics to indefinitely sustain a
superposition of different energy states. Finally, we establish a formal

engineering and resource strategy enables a multidisciplinary research approach
to identify specific risks within the value chain, aggregated as the so-called
resource criticality. Here, we demonstrate a step-by-step criticality
assessment in the sector of basic materials research for multifunctional
hexagonal manganite YMnO3, which can be a candidate for future electronic

reduced supply risk and enhanced environmental sustainability of new

processes, through several visual and non-visual retinal phototransduction
channels whose basic features are being unveiled by recent research. The
growing body of evidence on the significance of these effects has sparked a
renewed interest in the determination of the light field at the entrance pupil
of the eye in indoor spaces. Since photic interactions are strongly
wavelength-dependent, a significant effort is being devoted to assess the
relative merits of the spectra of the different types of light sources
available for use at home and in the workplace. The spectral content of the
light reaching the observer eyes in indoor spaces, however, does not depend
exclusively on the sources: it is partially modulated by the spectral
reflectance of the walls and surrounding surfaces, through the multiple
reflections of the light beams along all possible paths from the source to the
observer. This modulation can modify significantly the non-visual photic inputs
that would be produced by the lamps alone, and opens the way for controlling
-to a certain extent- the subject's exposure to different regions of the
optical spectrum. In this work we evaluate the expected magnitude of this
effect and we show that, for factorizable sources, the spectral modulation can
be conveniently described in terms of a set of effective filter-like functions
that provide useful insights for lighting design and light pollution
assessment. The radiance field also provides a suitable bridge between indoor
and outdoor light pollution studies.

momentum to generate twisted excitons with well-defined quasi-angular momenta

of a paraxial approximation for the light beam. A sequence of absorption events
can thus be used to create a range of excitonic angular momenta. Subsequent
decay can produce radiation with a single angular momentum equal to that
accumulated. Such molecules can thus be viewed as mediators for changing the
angular momentum of light. This sidesteps the need to exploit nonlinear
light-matter interactions based on higher-order susceptibilities. A
tight-binding paradigm is used to verify angular momentum conservation and
demonstrate how it can be exploited to change the angular momentum of light.

comprise the instance are revealed one by one in a stream and the goal is to
solve the problem by making one or few passes over the stream while maintaining
a sublinear space $o(mn)$ in the input size; here $m$ denotes the number of the

concerned with the space requirement of the algorithms and hence do not

  Our main result is a resolution of the space-approximation tradeoff for the
streaming set cover problem: we show that any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm
for the set cover problem requires $\widetilde{\Omega}(mn^{1/\alpha})$ space,
even if it is allowed polylog${(n)}$ passes over the stream, and even if the
sets are arriving in a random order in the stream. This space-approximation
tradeoff matches the best known bounds achieved by the recent algorithm of
Har-Peled et.al. (PODS 2016) that requires only $O(\alpha)$ passes over the
stream in an adversarial order, hence settling the space complexity of
approximating the set cover problem in data streams in a quite robust manner.
Additionally, our approach yields tight lower bounds for the space complexity
of $(1- \epsilon)$-approximating the streaming maximum coverage problem studied

  The subalgebra of ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$-invariants in

of invariant theory for ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$.
  We show that the above mentioned superalgebra homomorphism is an isomorphism

monomial basis for the subalgebra of invariants in this case. When the
homomorphism is not injective, we give a representation theoretical description
of the generating elements of the kernel associated to the partition
$((m+1)^{n+1})$, producing the second fundamental theorem of invariant theory

  We consider two applications of our results. A complete treatment of the
non-commutative polynomial version of invariant theory for ${\rm{

explicit SFT is proved, which we believe to be new. The FFT and SFT of the

into n bundles, and then receive a minimum valued bundle. Since maximin fair
allocations (i.e., allocations in which each agent gets at least her maximin

that aim to find allocations in which the value of the bundle allocated to each
agent is (multiplicatively) as close to her maximin share as possible. In
particular, Procaccia and Wang (2014) along with Amanatidis et al. (2015) have
shown that under additive valuations a 2/3-approximate maximin fair allocation
always exists and can be found in polynomial time. We complement these results
by developing a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves the same
approximation guarantee.
  Furthermore, we initiate the study of approximate maximin fair division under
submodular valuations. Specifically, we show that when the valuations of the
agents are nonnegative, monotone, and submodular, then a 0.21-approximate
maximin fair allocation is guaranteed to exist. In fact, we show that such an
allocation can be efficiently found by using a simple round-robin algorithm. A
technical contribution of the paper is to analyze the performance of this
combinatorial algorithm by employing the concept of multilinear extensions.

debris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at
multiple scales. We aim at studying the likelihood of a scenario where the
planet formed closer to the stars in the disk, underwent inward disk-induced
migration, and got scattered away by the binary star before being stabilized by
a close encounter (fly-by). We performed semi-analytical calculations and
numerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the
planet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We
studied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,
and therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to
determine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)
onto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion
resonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet. Nonetheless,
we estimate that the fly-by hypothesis decreases the scenario probability to
less than $10^{-7}$ for a derived local density of stars of 0.11
stars/pc$^{3}$. We show that the concomitant effect of the planet and stars
trajectories induce spiral-features in the disk which may correspond to the
observed asymmetries. Moreover, the present disk shape suggests that the planet
is on an eccentric orbit. The scenario we explored is a natural hypothesis if
the planet formed within a disk. Conversely, its low probability of occurrence
and the fact that HD 106906 b shares some characteristics with other systems in

  Election in Radio Networks",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study two fundamental communication primitives: broadcasting and leader
election in the classical model of multi-hop radio networks with unknown
topology and without collision detection mechanisms.
  It has been known for almost 20 years that in undirected networks with n
nodes and diameter D, randomized broadcasting requires Omega(D log n/D + log^2
n) rounds in expectation, assuming that uninformed nodes are not allowed to
communicate (until they are informed). Only very recently, Haeupler and Wajc
(PODC'2016) showed that this bound can be slightly improved for the model with
spontaneous transmissions, providing an O(D log n loglog n / log D + log^O(1)
n)-time broadcasting algorithm. In this paper, we give a new and faster
algorithm that completes broadcasting in O(D log n/log D + log^O(1) n) time,
with high probability. This yields the first optimal O(D)-time broadcasting
algorithm whenever D is polynomial in n.
  Furthermore, our approach can be applied to design a new leader election
algorithm that matches the performance of our broadcasting algorithm.
Previously, all fast randomized leader election algorithms have been using
broadcasting as their subroutine and their complexity have been asymptotically
strictly bigger than the complexity of broadcasting. In particular, the fastest
previously known randomized leader election algorithm of Ghaffari and Haeupler
(SODA'2013) requires O(D log n/D min{loglog n, log n/D} + log^O(1) n)-time with
high probability. Our new algorithm requires O(D log n / log D + log^O(1) n)
time with high probability, and it achieves the optimal O(D) time whenever D is
polynomial in n.

recombination lines (RLs). The RL C/O ratio indicates that this PN is O-rich,
which is also supported by the detection of the broad 9/18 um bands from
amorphous silicate grain. The observed elemental abundances can be explained by
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis models for initially 1-1.5 Msun
stars with Z = 0.008. The Ne overabundance might be due to the enhancement of
22Ne isotope in the He-rich intershell. By using the spectrum of the central
star synthesized by Tlusty as the ionization/heating source of the PN, we
constructed the self-consistent photoionization model with Cloudy to the
observed quantities, and we derived the gas and dust masses, dust-to-gas mass
ratio, and core-mass of the central star. About 80 % of the total dust mass is
from warm-cold dust component beyond ionization front. Comparison with other
Galactic PNe indicates that Hen3-1357 is an ordinary amorphous silicate rich
and O-rich gas PN. Among other studied PNe, IC4846 shows many similarities in
properties of the PN to Hen3-1357, although their post-AGB evolution is quite
different from each other. Further monitoring observations and comparisons with

plane quartic curve. Moreover, he also proved that there is no Hurwitz curve of
genus $g=2,4,5,6$. Later, in 1965, Macbeath proved the existence, up to
isomorphisms, of a unique Hurwitz curve of genus $g=7$; this known as the
Fricke-Macbeath curve. Equations were also provided; that being the fiber
product of suitable three elliptic curves. In the same year, Edge constructed
such a genus seven Hurwitz curve by elementary projective geometry. Such a
construction was provided by first constructing a $4$-dimensional family of
closed Riemann surfaces $S_{\mu}$ admitting a group $G_{\mu} \cong {\mathbb

zero. In this paper we discuss the above curves in terms of fiber products of

both a coulomb and a time-dependent laser electric fields, the so-called
Coulomb-Volkov (CV) state, is addressed. Despite its derivation for continuum
states does not exhibit any particular problem within the framework of the
standard theory of quantum mechanics (QM), difficulties arise when considering
an initially bound atomic state. Indeed the natural way of translating the
unperturbed momentum by the laser vector potential is no longer possible since
a bound state does not exhibit a plane wave form including explicitely a
momentum. The use of a fractal space permits to naturally define a momentum for
a bound wave function. Within this framework, it is shown how the derivation of
laser-dressed bound states can be performed. Based on a generalized eikonal
approach, a new expression for the laser-dressed states is also derived, fully
symmetric relative to the continuum or bound nature of the initial unperturbed
wave function. It includes an additional crossed term in the Volkov phase which
was not obtained within the standard theory of quantum mechanics. The
derivations within this fractal framework have highlighted other possible ways
to derive approximate laser-dressed states in QM. After comparing the various
obtained wave functions, an application to the prediction of the ionization
probability of hydrogen targets by attosecond XUV pulses within the sudden
approximation is provided. This approach allows to make predictions in various
regimes depending on the laser intensity, going from the non-resonant

problems, tradition models for the stochastic user equilibrium problem are
designed as mathematical programming problems. In this article, a
Physarum-inspired model for the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium
problem is proposed. There are two main contributions of our work. On the one
hand, the origin Physarum model is modified to find the shortest path in
traffic direction networks with the properties of two-way traffic
characteristic. On the other hand, the modified Physarum-inspired model could
get the equilibrium flows when traveller's perceived transportation cost
complies with normal distribution. The proposed method is constituted with a
two-step procedure. First, the modified Physarum model is applied to get the
auxiliary flows. Second, the auxiliary flows are averaged to obtain the
equilibrium flows. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method, which is compared with the Method of
Successive Average method.

cold fronts, implies that the intracluster medium was recently disturbed. We
analyze the properties of the intracluster medium using multiple Chandra
observations of Abell 2204. We find a density ratio $n_{\rm in}/n_{\rm out} =
2.05\pm0.05$ and a temperature ratio $T_{\rm out}/T_{\rm in} = 1.91\pm0.27$

together with the spiral pattern observed in the cluster core, supports the
sloshing scenario for Abell 2204. No Kelvin-Helmholtz eddies are observed along
the cold front surfaces, indicating that they are effectively suppressed by
some physical mechanism. We argue that the suppression is likely facilitated by
the magnetic fields amplified in the sloshing motion, and deduce from the
measured gas properties that the magnetic field strength should be greater than
$24\pm6$ $\mu$G and $32\pm8$ $\mu$G along the west and east cold fronts,

Here we set out to better understand the repeatability of evolution. We
explored experimentally the effect of mutation supply and the strength of
selective pressure on the repeatability of selection from standing genetic
variation. Different sizes of mutant libraries of an antibiotic resistance
gene, TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase in Escherichia coli, were subjected to different
antibiotic concentrations. We determined whether populations went extinct or
survived, and sequenced the TEM gene of the surviving populations. The
distribution of mutations per allele in our mutant libraries- generated by
error-prone PCR- followed a Poisson distribution. Extinction patterns could be
explained by a simple stochastic model that assumed the sampling of beneficial
mutations was key for survival. In most surviving populations, alleles
containing at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present.
These genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to
describe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations.
Hence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational
fitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear
trends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all
mutations present. However, when only known large-effect mutations were
considered, the outcome of selection is less repeatable for large libraries, in
contrast to expectations. Furthermore, we show experimentally that alleles
carrying multiple mutations selected from large libraries confer higher
resistance levels relative to alleles with only a known large-effect mutation,
suggesting that the scarcity of high-resistance alleles carrying multiple
mutations may contribute to the decrease in repeatability at large library
sizes.

previous approaches to support information seeking are task-specific, thus
understanding engineers' seeking behavior in specific tasks is fundamental. We

behavior, and that some do not consider traceability particularly useful when
conducting CIA. Furthermore, we observe a tendency for engineers to prefer less
rigid types of support rather than formal approaches, i.e., engineers value
support that allows flexibility in how to practically conduct CIA. Finally, due
to diverse information seeking behavior, we argue that future CIA support
should embrace individual preferences to identify change impact by empowering
several seeking alternatives, including searching, browsing, and tracing.

several advantages over simulating them on conventional computers, particularly
in terms of speed and energy consumption. However, this usually comes at the
cost of reduced control over the dynamics of the emulated networks. In this
paper, we demonstrate how iterative training of a hardware-emulated network can
compensate for anomalies induced by the analog substrate. We first convert a
deep neural network trained in software to a spiking network on the BrainScaleS
wafer-scale neuromorphic system, thereby enabling an acceleration factor of 10
000 compared to the biological time domain. This mapping is followed by the
in-the-loop training, where in each training step, the network activity is
first recorded in hardware and then used to compute the parameter updates in
software via backpropagation. An essential finding is that the parameter
updates do not have to be precise, but only need to approximately follow the
correct gradient, which simplifies the computation of updates. Using this
approach, after only several tens of iterations, the spiking network shows an
accuracy close to the ideal software-emulated prototype. The presented
techniques show that deep spiking networks emulated on analog neuromorphic
devices can attain good computational performance despite the inherent
variations of the analog substrate.

their cluster synchronization. Radial cluster emerges when the nodes are
synchronized along a ray, while circular cluster is formed by nodes without
immediate connections but located on identical distances to the hub. By its
nature the circular synchronization is a new manifestation of so called remote
synchronization [Phys. Rev. E 85 (2012), 026208]. We report its long-range form
when the synchronized nodes interact through at least three intermediate nodes.
Forms of long-range remote synchronization are elements of scenario of
transition to the total synchronization of the network. We observe that the far
ends of rays synchronize first. Then more circular clusters appear involving
closer to hub nodes. Subsequently the clusters merge and, finally, all network
become synchronous. Behavior of the extended starlike networks is found to be
strongly determined by the ray length, while varying the number of rays
basically affects fine details of a dynamical picture. Symmetry of the star
also extensively influences the dynamics. In an asymmetric star circular
cluster mainly vanish in favor of radial ones, however, long-range remote

two ways of handling the problem are used. The first class of methods employs a
distance measure on time series (e.g. Euclidean, Dynamic Time Warping) and a
clustering technique (e.g. k-means, k-medoids, hierarchical clustering) to find
natural groups in the dataset. It is, however, often not clear whether these
distance measures effectively take into account the specific temporal
correlations in these time series. The second class of methods uses the
input/output data to identify a dynamic system using an identification scheme,
and then applies a model norm-based distance (e.g. H2, H-infinity) to find out
which systems are similar. This, however, can be very time consuming for large
amounts of long time series data. We show that the new distance measure
presented in this paper performs as good as when every input/output pair is
modelled explicitly, but remains computationally much less complex. The
complexity of calculating this distance between two time series of length N is
O(N logN).

In this
paper, we introduce a technique for speeding up multi-agent learning by
exploiting concurrent and incremental experience sharing. This solution
adaptively identifies opportunities to transfer experiences between agents and
allows for the rapid acquisition of appropriate policies in large-scale,
stochastic, homogeneous multi-agent systems. We introduce an online,
distributed, supervisor-directed transfer technique for constructing high-level
characterizations of an agent's dynamic learning environment---called
contexts---which are used to identify groups of agents operating under
approximately similar dynamics within a short temporal window. A set of
supervisory agents computes contextual information for groups of subordinate
agents, thereby identifying candidates for experience sharing. Our method uses
a tiered architecture to propagate, with low communication overhead, state,
action, and reward data amongst the members of each dynamically-identified
information-sharing group. We applied this method to a large-scale distributed
task allocation problem with hundreds of information-sharing agents operating
in an unknown, non-stationary environment. We demonstrate that our approach
results in significant performance gains, that it is robust to noise-corrupted
or suboptimal context features, and that communication costs scale linearly
with the supervisor-to-subordinate ratio.

sampling (RT-MWCS) method to facilitate efficient realization of sub-Nyquist
rate compressive sampling systems for sparse wideband signals. Under the
assumption that the signal is repetitively (not necessarily periodically)
triggered, RT-MWCS uses random modulation to obtain measurements of the signal
at randomly chosen positions. It uses multiple measurement vector method to
estimate the non-zero supports of the signal in the frequency domain. Then, the
signal spectrum is solved using least square estimation. The distinct ability
of estimating sparse multiband signal is facilitated with the use of level
triggering and time to digital converter devices previously used in random
equivalent sampling (RES) scheme. Compared to the existing compressive sampling
(CS) techniques, such as modulated wideband converter (MWC), RT-MWCS is with
simple system architecture and can be implemented with one channel at the cost
of more sampling time. Experimental results indicate that, for sparse multiband
signal with unknown spectral support, RT-MWCS requires a sampling rate much
lower than Nyquist rate, while giving great quality of signal reconstruction.

the monogamy laws of entanglement. Although the monogamy relation has been
explored extensively in the last decade, it is still not clear to what extent a

known related results at first. Consequently, we propose the monogamy power of
an entanglement measure and the polygamy power for its dual quantity, the
assisted entanglement, and show that both the monogamy power and the polygamy

formalize exactly for the first time when an entanglement measure and an

novel dataset of prices and ratings. The market is a black market, and so
contracts cannot be enforced. We study the role that reputation plays in
alleviating adverse selection in this market. We document the following
stylized facts: (i) There is a positive relationship between the price and the
rating of a seller. This effect is increasing in the number of reviews left for
a seller. A mature highly-rated seller charges a 20% higher price than a mature
low-rated seller. (ii) Sellers with more reviews charge higher prices
regardless of rating. (iii) Low-rated sellers are more likely to exit the
market and make fewer sales. We show that these stylized facts are explained by
a dynamic model of adverse selection, ratings, and exit, in which buyers form
rational inferences about the quality of a seller jointly from his rating and
number of sales. Sellers who receive low ratings initially charge the same
price as highly-rated sellers since early reviews are less informative about
quality. Bad sellers exit rather than face lower prices in the future. We
provide conditions under which our model admits a unique equilibrium. We
estimate the model, and use the result to compute the returns to reputation in
the market. We find that the market would have collapsed due to adverse
selection in the absence of a rating system.

compact star model having a spherically symmetric metric of embedding class
one. Here we have assumed an arbitrary form of metric function and solved the
Einstein relativistic field equations with the help of Karmarkar condition for
an anisotropic matter distri- bution. The physical properties of our model such
as pressure, density, mass function, surface red-shift, gravitational red-shift
are investigated and the stability of the stellar configuration is discussed in
details. Our model is free from central singularities and satisfies all energy
conditions. The model we present here satisfy the static stability criterion.

the concrete and the neutronics, in particular it's relevance to modern
spallation neutron sources, such as the European Spallation Source (ESS),
currently under construction in Lund, Sweden. The new concrete exhibits a 15%
lower mass density, a compressible strength of 50% relative to a standard
concrete and a significant increase in performance of shielding against MeV
neutrons and lower energies. The concrete could find application at the ESS in
for example common shielding components, individual beamline shielding and
instrument caves. Initial neutronic tests of the concrete, carried out at Lund
University, have also verified the performance in the MeV neutron energy range
and the results are presented.

in fractional quantum mechanics have an unexpected space dependence:
propagating fields may have non-transverse components, and the distinction
between near-field zone and wave zone is blurred. We employ an extension of
Maxwell theory, Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics, which is compatible with
currents $j^\nu$ conserved globally but not locally, we have derived in another
work the field equation $\partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu}=j^\nu+i^\nu$, where $i^\nu$
is a non-local function of $j^\nu$, called ""secondary current"". Y.\ Wei has
recently proved that the probability current in fractional quantum mechanics is
in general not locally conserved. We compute this current for a Gaussian wave
packet with fractional parameter $a=3/2$ and find that in a suitable limit it
can be approximated by our simplified dipolar source. Currents which are not
locally conserved may be present also in other quantum systems whose wave
functions satisfy non-local equations. The combined electromagnetic effects of
such sources and their secondary currents are very interesting both
theoretically and for potential applications.

measure the twisting of the time axis. This single assumption, and simple
construction, gives rise to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, the
Lorentz force law and the Einstein-Maxwell equations for electromagnetism
coupled to General relativity. The derivations follow the Kaluza Klein theory,
but with the constraints required for connections on a U(1) bundle rather than
five spacetime dimensions. The non time orientability is seen to justify and
constrain Kaluza Klein theories exactly as required to unify gravitation with
electromagnetism. Unlike any other schemes, apparent net electric charges arise
naturally because the direction of the electric field reverses along a time
reversing path. The boundary of a time reversing region can therefore have a
net electric flux and appear exactly as a region containing an electric charge.
The treatment is purely classical, but motivated by links between acausal
structures and quantum theory.

molecular kinetic theory is developed for the systematic description of the

microscopic empirical law of traders' trend-following behavior by tracking the
trajectories of all individuals, which quantifies the collective motion of HFTs
but has not been captured in conventional order-book models. We next introduce
the corresponding microscopic model of HFTs and present its theoretical
solution paralleling molecular kinetic theory: Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like
equations are derived from the microscopic dynamics via the
Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. Our model is the first
microscopic model that has been directly validated through data analysis of the
microscopic dynamics, exhibiting quantitative agreements with mesoscopic and
macroscopic empirical results.

or a high frequency signal (HFS) respectively on an excitable uni-junction
transistor relaxation oscillator (UJT-RO) is presented here. When the
perturbation by a WPS modulated with the noise is optimum, the UJT-RO has been
observed to produce regular dynamics that mimics the WPS maximum, which is
termed as stochastic resonance (SR). Interestingly, when the noise component is
replaced by a HFS, the system shows the same SR kind of behavior, which is
called vibrational resonance (VR). Here the system produces the dynamics that
