"1703.01939","Michael Elkin","Michael Elkin","Distributed Exact Shortest Paths in Sublinear Time",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distributed single-source shortest paths problem is one of the most
fundamental and central problems in the message-passing distributed computing.
Classical Bellman-Ford algorithm solves it in $O(n)$ time, where $n$ is the
number of vertices in the input graph $G$. Peleg and Rubinovich (FOCS'99)
showed a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(D + \sqrt{n})$ for this problem, where
$D$ is the hop-diameter of $G$.
  Whether or not this problem can be solved in $o(n)$ time when $D$ is
relatively small is a major notorious open question. Despite intensive research
\cite{LP13,N14,HKN15,EN16,BKKL16} that yielded near-optimal algorithms for the
approximate variant of this problem, no progress was reported for the original
problem.
  In this paper we answer this question in the affirmative. We devise an
algorithm that requires $O((n \log n)^{5/6})$ time, for $D = O(\sqrt{n \log
n})$, and $O(D^{1/3} \cdot (n \log n)^{2/3})$ time, for larger $D$. This
running time is sublinear in $n$ in almost the entire range of parameters,
specifically, for $D = o(n/\log^2 n)$. For the all-pairs shortest paths
problem, our algorithm requires $O(n^{5/3} \log^{2/3} n)$ time, regardless of
the value of $D$.
  We also devise the first algorithm with non-trivial complexity guarantees for
computing exact shortest paths in the multipass semi-streaming model of
computation.
  From the technical viewpoint, our algorithm computes a hopset $G""$ of a
skeleton graph $G'$ of $G$ without first computing $G'$ itself. We then conduct
a Bellman-Ford exploration in $G' \cup G""$, while computing the required edges
of $G'$ on the fly. As a result, our algorithm computes exactly those edges of
$G'$ that it really needs, rather than computing approximately the entire $G'$.

technology for measurement of rock fragmentation without placement of scale
objects in the scene to determine image scale. Commonly practiced image-based
rock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a rock pile, place
a scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D
images. Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire
real-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results;
however, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale
objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is
planar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves
our UAV-based approach to enable rock fragmentation measurement without
placement of scale objects and without the assumption of planarity. This is
achieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images,
taking into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking
2D images for fragmentation analysis. This work represents an important step
towards automating post-blast rock fragmentation analysis. In experiments, a
rock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with and
without using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects,
a point cloud of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale.
Comparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based
method enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy
(within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.

by introducing a novel method from the perspective of distance metric learning.
Our approach enables a robot to reason about the similarity between pairwise

measurements. In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the
temporal dynamics of such data, it is essential to understand the relationships
between the different entities and how these relationships evolve over time. In
this paper, we introduce the time-varying graphical lasso (TVGL), a method of
inferring time-varying networks from raw time series data. We cast the problem
in terms of estimating a sparse time-varying inverse covariance matrix, which
reveals a dynamic network of interdependencies between the entities. Since
dynamic network inference is a computationally expensive task, we derive a
scalable message-passing algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in an efficient way. We also discuss
several extensions, including a streaming algorithm to update the model and
incorporate new observations in real time. Finally, we evaluate our TVGL
algorithm on both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results
and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both accuracy and
scalability.

used by large numbers of Internet services. If they follow recommended
practice, users are faced with the almost insuperable problem of generating and
managing a large number of site-unique and strong (i.e. non-guessable)
passwords. One way of addressing this problem is through the use of a password
generator, i.e. a client-side scheme which generates (and regenerates)
site-specific strong passwords on demand, with the minimum of user input. This
paper provides a detailed specification and analysis of AutoPass, a password
generator scheme previously outlined as part of a general analysis of such
schemes. AutoPass has been designed to address issues identified in previously
proposed password generators, and incorporates novel techniques to address
these issues. Unlike almost all previously proposed schemes, AutoPass enables
the generation of passwords that meet important real-world requirements,
including forced password changes, use of pre-specified passwords, and
generation of passwords meeting site-specific requirements.

The direct solution to such problems requires grids that are small enough to
resolve this fine scale variability which unavoidably requires the repeated
solution of very large systems of algebraic equations. We establish a
physically inspired, data-driven coarse-grained model which learns a low-
dimensional set of microstructural features that are predictive of the
fine-grained model (FG) response. Once learned, those features provide a sharp
distribution over the coarse scale effec- tive coefficients of the PDE that are
most suitable for prediction of the fine scale model output. This ultimately
allows to replace the computationally expensive FG by a generative proba-
bilistic model based on evaluating the much cheaper CG several times. Sparsity
enforcing pri- ors further increase predictive efficiency and reveal
microstructural features that are important in predicting the FG response.
Moreover, the model yields probabilistic rather than single-point predictions,
which enables the quantification of the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty that
is present due to the information loss that occurs during the coarse-graining
process.

when the system is complex with uncertain information or state space is not

combining Dempster-Shafer evidence theory with Markov chain. In our model, the
uncertain data is allowed to be handle in the form of interval number and the
basic probability assignment(BPA) is generated based on the distance between
interval numbers. The new belief Markov chain model overcomes the shortcomings
of classical Markov chain and has an efficient ability in dealing with

a quantum particle is supposed to spend is a specified region of space $\Om$.
By construction, the result is a real positive number, and the method seems to
avoid the difficulty of introducing complex time parameters, which arises in
the Feynman paths approach. However, it tells little about about the particle's
motion. We investigate this matter further, and show that the SWP clock, like
any other Larmor clock, correlates the rotation of its angular momentum with
the durations, $\tau$, which the Feynman paths spend in $\Om$, thereby
destroying interference between different durations. An inaccurate weakly
coupled clock leaves the interference almost intact, and the need to resolve
the resulting ""which way?"" problem is one of the main difficulties at the
centre of the ""tunnelling time"" controversy. In the absence of a probability
distribution for the values of $\tau$, the SWP results are expressed in terms
of moduli of the ""complex times"", given by the weighted sums of the
corresponding probability amplitudes. It is shown that over-interpretation of
these results, by treating the SWP times as physical time intervals, leads to
paradoxes and should be avoided. We also analyse various settings of the SWP
clock, different calibration procedures, and the relation between the SWP
results and the quantum dwell time. The cases of stationary tunnelling and
tunnel ionisation are considered in some detail. Although our detailed analysis
addresses only one particular definition of the duration of a tunnelling
process, it also points towards the impossibility of uniting various time
parameters, which may occur in quantum theory, within the concept of a single

for guaranteeing generalization in adaptive data analysis. Specifically, if a
differentially private analysis is applied on a sample S of i.i.d. examples to
select a low-sensitivity function f, then w.h.p. f(S) is close to its
expectation, although f is being chosen based on the data.
  Very recently, Steinke and Ullman observed that these generalization
guarantees can be used for proving concentration bounds in the non-adaptive
setting, where the low-sensitivity function is fixed beforehand. In particular,
they obtain alternative proofs for classical concentration bounds for
low-sensitivity functions, such as the Chernoff bound and McDiarmid's
Inequality.
  In this work, we set out to examine the situation for functions with
high-sensitivity, for which differential privacy does not imply generalization
guarantees under adaptive analysis. We show that differential privacy can be
used to prove concentration bounds for such functions in the non-adaptive
setting.

mathematical model of a dielectrophoretic force for model-based feedback
micromanipulation. Any such model is expected to sufficiently accurately relate
the voltages (electric potentials) applied to the electrodes to the resulting
forces exerted on microparticles at given locations in the workspace. This
model also has to be computationally simple enough to be used in real time as
required by model-based feedback control. Most existing models involve solving
two- or three-dimensional mixed boundary value problems. As such, they are
usually analytically intractable and have to be solved numerically instead. A
numerical solution is, however, infeasible in real time, hence such models are
not suitable for feedback control. We present a novel approximation of the
boundary value data for which a closed-form analytical solution is feasible; we
solve a mixed boundary value problem numerically off-line only once, and based
on this solution we approximate the mixed boundary conditions by Dirichlet
boundary conditions. This way we get an approximated boundary value problem
allowing the application of the analytical framework of Green's functions. Thus
obtained closed-form analytical solution is amenable to real-time use and
closely matches the numerical solution of the original exact problem.

do so, we propose a closed-loop control framework based on the
users(subjective) feedbacks to learn the QoE function and optimize it at the

operates on subsets of the system Hilbert space by constructing approximations

numerically, finding similar performance to DMRG in the case of a gapped

identify candidate states having large overlap with ground and low-energy

electron-phonon interaction are common in highly polarizable and disordered
materials such as amorphous chalcogenides, but there is no direct evidence for
them in large-band-gap insulators. Here we report how such negative-$U$ centers
are responsible for widespread insulator-to-metal transitions in amorphous
HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ thin films with a 10$^9$-fold resistance drop.
Triggered by a static hydraulic pressure or a 0.1 ps impulse of magnetic
pressure, the transition can proceed at such low pressure that there is very
little overall deformation (strain~10$^{-5}$). Absent a significant energy
change overall, the transition is attributed to the reversal of localized
electron-phonon interaction: By reversing the sign of $U$, trapped electrons
are destabilized and released, thus clearing conduction paths previously
blocked by charged traps. The results also suggest that Mott insulators when
disordered may become Anderson insulators with strong electron-phonon
interactions regulating incipient conduction paths, a novel finding of
technological significance for electronic devices.

Typical density functional theory calculations, especially those using local

we develop a new fully self-consistent predictive scheme to accurately compute
level alignment at certain classes of complex heterogeneous molecule-metal

Starting from a highly accurate description of the gas-phase electronic

polarization effects via tuning of the long-range screened exchange in a
range-separated hybrid in a non-empirical and system-specific manner. We
implement this functional in a plane-wave code and apply it to several
physisorbed and chemisorbed molecule-metal interface systems. Our results are
in quantitative agreement with experiments, both the level alignment and work

this seminal contribution, over the years, many studies have investigated the
existence and form of scaling in Internet traffic. This contribution aims first
at presenting a methodology, combining multiscale analysis (wavelet and wavelet
leaders) and random projections (or sketches), permitting a precise, efficient
and robust characterization of scaling which is capable of seeing through
non-stationary anomalies. Second, we apply the methodology to a data set
spanning an unusually long period: 14 years, from the MAWI traffic archive,
thereby allowing an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the form, nature and
evolutions of scaling in Internet traffic, as well as network mechanisms
producing them. We also study a separate 3-day long trace to obtain
complementary insight into intra-day behavior. We find that a biscaling (two
ranges of independent scaling phenomena) regime is systematically observed:
long-range dependence over the large scales, and multifractal-like scaling over
the fine scales. We quantify the actual scaling ranges precisely, verify to
high accuracy the expected relationship between the long range dependent
parameter and the heavy tail parameter of the flow size distribution, and
relate fine scale multifractal scaling to typical IP packet inter-arrival and

acquired by a low-complexity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with $1$-bit
output resolution and an unknown quantization threshold is considered.
Single-comparator ADCs are energy-efficient and can be operated at ultra-high
sampling rates. For analysis of such systems, a fixed and known quantization
threshold is usually assumed. In the symmetric case, i.e., zero hard-limiting
offset, it is known that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime the
signal processing performance degrades moderately by ${2}/{\pi}$ ($-1.96$ dB)
when comparing to an ideal $\infty$-bit converter. Due to hardware
imperfections, low-complexity $1$-bit ADCs will in practice exhibit an unknown
threshold different from zero. Therefore, we study the accuracy which can be
obtained with receive data processed by a hard-limiter with unknown
quantization level by using asymptotically optimal channel estimation
algorithms. To characterize the estimation performance of these nonlinear
algorithms, we employ analytic error expressions for different setups while
modeling the offset as a nuisance parameter. In the low SNR regime, we
establish the necessary condition for a vanishing loss due to missing offset
knowledge at the receiver. As an application, we consider the estimation of
single-input single-output wireless channels with inter-symbol interference and
validate our analysis by comparing the analytic and experimental performance of
the studied estimation algorithms. Finally, we comment on the extension to
multiple-input multiple-output channel models.

bi-stable nondegenerate on-site potential. If one adopts linear coupling in the
chain and piecewise linear on-site force, then it is possible to develop
well-known exact solutions for the front and accompanying oscillatory tail. We
demonstrate that these solutions are essentially non-robust. Various
approximations for the on-site potential with the same basic parameters (height
and coordinate of the potential barrier, energy effect and distance between the
potential wells) lead to substantially different front velocities. Besides,
inclusion of even weak nearest neighbor nonlinearity drastically modifies the
front structure and parameters. The energy concentration in the front zone
leads to a dominance of the nonlinear term. It turns out that the dynamics can
be efficiently studied in terms of an equivalent model with a single degree of
freedom. This estimation leads to accurate prediction of the front velocity and
parameters of the oscillatory tail. Moreover, it turns out that the solution is
robust - exact shape of the on-site potential weakly effects the front
parameters. This finding also conforms to the simplified model, since the
latter invokes only the general shape characteristics of the on-site potential.

across the interface that peaked at small momentum transfers. In this paper, we
examine the implications of such a coupling on the phononic properties of the

of phonon lineshape, which may result in charge instabilities at
long-wavelengths. However, we further find that the inclusion of Coulombic
screening significantly reduces the phonon broadening. Our results show that

Importantly, our simulation of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) encapsulated within
DNA icosahedra revealed enhanced stability of the AuNP loaded DNA icosahedra
compared to empty icosahedra. This is consistent with experimental results that
show high yields of cargo-encapsulated DNA icosahedra that have led to its
diverse applications for precision targeting. These studies reveal that the
stabilizing interactions between the cargo and the DNA scaffold powerfully
positions DNA polyhedra as targetable nanocapsules for payload delivery. These
insights can be exploited for precise molecular display for diverse biological
applications.

the baryon fraction in cluster of galaxies. In this proposal we need a
configuration in which a supernova Type Ia resides in a brightest cluster
galaxy of intermediate redshift clusters. We show this supernova Type Ia can be
used to measure the bulk velocity of a galaxy cluster. We assert that the
redshift range of $0.4<z<0.6$ is suitable for this proposal. The main
contribution to the deviation of standard candles distance modulus from
cosmological background prediction in this redshift range comes from peculiar
velocity of the host galaxy and gravitational lensing. In this work we argue
that by the knowledge of the bulk flow of the galaxy cluster and the cosmic
microwave background photons temperature change due to kinematic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich, we can constrain the baryon fraction of galaxy cluster. The
probability of this configuration for clusters is obtained. We estimate in a
conservative parameter estimation the large synoptic survey telescope can find
spectroscopically followed $\sim 4500$ galaxy clusters with a bright cluster
galaxy which hosts a type Ia Supernova each year. Finally, we show the
improving of the distance modulus measurement is the key improvement in future
surveys which will be crucial to detect the baryon fraction of cluster with the
proposed method.

with conformal Markov property and symmetry. We give the complete
classification of such curves: conformal Markov property and symmetry single
out a two-parameter family of random curves---Hypergeometric SLE---denoted by
hSLE$_{\kappa}(\nu)$ for $\kappa\in (0,4]$ and $\nu<\kappa-6$. The proof relies
crucially on Dub\'edat's commutation relation [Dub07] and a uniqueness result
proved in [MS16b]. The classification indicates that hypergeometric SLE is the
only possible scaling limit of the interfaces in critical lattice models
(conjectured or proved to be conformal invariant) in topological rectangles
with alternating boundary conditions.
  We also prove various properties of hSLE: continuity, reversibility,
target-independence, and conditional law characterization. As by-products, we
give two applications of these properties. The first one is about the critical
Ising interfaces. We prove the convergence of the Ising interface in rectangles
with alternating boundary conditions. This result was first proved by Izyurov
in [Izy15], but our proof is new which is based on the properties of hSLE. The
second application is the existence of the so-called pure partition functions
of multiple SLEs. Such existence was proved for $\kappa\in (0,8)\setminus
\mathbb{Q}$ in [KP16], and it was later proved for $\kappa\in (0,4]$ in [PW17].
We give a new proof of the existence for $\kappa\in (0,6]$ using the properties
of hSLE.

that the onset of heating occurs due to the creation of vortex-antivortex

shows good agreement, if a systematic shift of the critical phase-space density

the condensate and the thermal wings, which were used in the experiment to
extract the temperature. We expand on this observation by studying the full

make progress in the study of the evolution of the correlation between the mass
of supermassive black holes ($\mathcal M_{BH}$) and their host galaxy
luminosity ($L_{host}$). We demonstrate the power of lensing by analyzing two
systems for which state-of-the-art lens modelling techniques have been applied
to Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. We use i) the reconstructed images to
infer the total and bulge luminosity of the host and ii) published broad-line
spectroscopy to estimate $\mathcal M_{BH}$ using the so-called virial method.
We then enlarge our sample with new calibration of previously published
measurements to study the evolution of the correlation out to z~4.5. Consistent
with previous work, we find that without taking into account passive luminosity
evolution, the data points lie on the local relation. Once passive luminosity
evolution is taken into account, we find that BHs in the more distant Universe
reside in less luminous galaxies than today. Fitting this offset as $\mathcal
M_{BH}$/$L_{host}$ $\propto$ (1+z)$^{\gamma}$, and taking into account
selection effects, we obtain $\gamma$ = 0.6 $\pm$ 0.1 and 0.8$\pm$ 0.1 for the
case of $\mathcal M_{BH}$-$L_{bulge}$ and $\mathcal M_{BH}$-$L_{total}$,

also consider a reduced sample that is homogeneous in data quality. We find
consistent results but with considerably larger uncertainty due to the more

0.2$\pm$ 0.5 for $\mathcal M_{BH}$-$L_{bulge}$ and $\mathcal

and the structure of the ISM. Structure can most directly be observed by
extensive spectroscopic surveys, including surveys of stars where DIBs are
especially important, as they are conveniently found in all observed bands.
Large surveys lack the quality of spectra to detect weak DIBs, so many spectra
from small regions on the sky have to be combined before a sufficient
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved. However, the clumpiness of the DIB
clouds is unknown, which poses a problem, as the measured properties can end up
being averaged over a too large area. We use a technique called Gaussian
processes to accurately measure profiles of interstellar absorption lines in
145 high SNR and high resolution spectra of hot stars. Together with Bayesian
MCMC approach we also get reliable estimates of the uncertainties. We derive
scales at which column densities of 18 DIBs, CH, CH$^+$, Ca I, and Ca II show
some spatial correlation. This correlation scale is associated with the size of
the ISM clouds. Scales expressed as the angle on the sky vary significantly
from DIB to DIB between $\sim0.23^\circ$ for the DIB at 5512 {\AA} and
3.5$^\circ$ for the DIB at 6196 {\AA}, suggesting that different DIB carriers
have different clumpiness but occupy the same general space. Our study includes
lines-of-sight all over the northern Milky Way, as well as out of the Galactic
plane, covering regions with different physical conditions. The derived
correlation scales therefore represent a general image of the Galactic ISM on

compact (30 pc effective radius) stellar systems separated by ~300pc, after
correcting for lensing amplification. We measured several rest-frame
ultraviolet and optical narrow (\sigma_v <~ 25 km/s) high-ionization lines.
These features may be the signature of very hot (T>50000 K) stars within dense
stellar clusters, whose dynamical mass is likely dominated by the stellar
component. Remarkably, the ultraviolet metal lines are not accompanied by Lya
emission (e.g., CIV / Lya > 15), despite the fact that the Lya line flux is
expected to be 150 times brighter (inferred from the Hbeta flux). A
spatially-offset, strongly-magnified (\mu>50) Lya emission with a spatial
extent <~7.6 kpc^2 is instead identified 2 kpc away from the system. The origin
of such a faint emission can be the result of fluorescent Lya induced by a
transverse leakage of ionizing radiation emerging from the stellar systems
and/or can be associated to an underlying and barely detected object (with m_uv
> 34 de-lensed). This is the first confirmed metal-line emitter at such
low-luminosity and redshift without Lya emission, suggesting that, at least in
some cases, a non-uniform covering factor of the neutral gas might hamper the
Lya detection.

velocity fields from observed radial peculiar velocities. This paper aims at
identifying the optimal design of peculiar velocity surveys within the WF
framework. The prime goal is to test the dependence of the quality of the
reconstruction on the distribution and nature of data points. Mock datasets,
extending to 250 Mpc/h, are drawn from a constrained simulation that mimics the
local Universe to produce realistic mock catalogs. Reconstructed fields
obtained with these mocks are compared to the reference simulation.
Comparisons, including residual distributions, cell-to-cell and bulk
velocities, imply that the presence of field data points is essential to
properly measure the flows. The fields reconstructed from mocks that consist
only of galaxy cluster data points exhibit poor quality bulk velocities. In
addition, the quality of the reconstruction depends strongly on the grouping of
individual data points into single points to suppress virial motions in high
density regions. Conversely, the presence of a Zone of Avoidance hardly affects
the reconstruction. For a given number of data points, a uniform sample does
not score any better than a sample with decreasing number of data points with
the distance. The best reconstructions are obtained with a grouped survey
containing field galaxies: Assuming no error, they differ from the simulated
field by less than 100 km/s up to the extreme edge of the catalogs or up to a
distance of three times the mean distance of data points for non-uniform
catalogs. The overall conclusions hold when errors are added.

be turbulent, because of magnetohydrodynamics instability activated at scales
too small to be resolved in simulations. To study the large-scale impact of
these instabilities, we develop a new formalism, based on the large-eddy
simulation technique, for the modeling of subgrid-scale turbulent transport in
general relativity. We apply it, for the first time, to the simulation of the
late-inspiral and merger of two NSs. We find that turbulence can significantly
affect the structure and survival time of the merger remnant, as well as its
gravitational-wave (GW) and neutrino emissions. The former will be relevant for
GW observation of merging neutron stars. The latter will affect the composition
of the outflow driven by the merger and might influence its nucleosynthetic
yields. The accretion rate after black-hole formation is also affected.
Nevertheless, we find that, for the most likely values of the turbulence mixing
efficiency, these effects are relatively small and the GW signal will be
affected only weakly by the turbulence. Thus, our simulations provide a first
validation of all existing post-merger GW models.

for topological superconductors: (i) spinful p-wave, and (ii) spin-split
spin-orbit-coupled s-wave. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the
zero-temperature dc current $I$ and differential conductance $dI/dV$ of
voltage-biased junctions with or without Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The
presence of an MZM necessarily gives rise to two tunneling conductance peaks at
voltages $eV = \pm \Delta_{\mathrm{lead}}$, i.e., the voltage at which the
superconducting gap edge of the lead aligns with the MZM. We find that the MZM
conductance peak probed by a superconducting lead $without$ a BCS singularity
has a non-universal value which decreases with decreasing junction
transparency. This is in contrast to the MZM tunneling conductance measured by
a superconducting lead $with$ a BCS singularity, where the conductance peak in
the tunneling limit takes the quantized value $G_M = (4-\pi)2e^2/h$ independent
of the junction transparency. We also discuss the ""subharmonic gap structure"",
a consequence of multiple Andreev reflections, in the presence and absence of
MZMs. Finally, we show that for finite-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs), the
conductance peaks shift away from the gap bias voltage $eV = \pm

two-point real-space correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ for four volume-limited
stellar mass and four luminosity, M$_{UV}$ absolute magnitude selected,
sub-samples. We find that the scale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$
significantly increases with increasing luminosity and stellar mass indicating
a strong galaxy clustering dependence on these properties. This corresponds to
a strong relative bias between these two sub-samples of $\Delta$b/b$^*$=0.43.
Fitting a 5-parameter HOD model we find that the most luminous and massive
galaxies occupy the most massive dark matter haloes with
$\langle$M$_h$$\rangle$ = 10$^{12.30}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. Similar to the
trends observed at lower redshift, the minimum halo mass M$_{min}$ depends on
the luminosity and stellar mass of galaxies and grows from M$_{min}$
=10$^{9.73}$ h$^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ to M$_{min}$=10$^{11.58}$ h$^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$
from the faintest to the brightest among our galaxy sample, respectively. We
find the difference between these halo masses to be much more pronounced than
is observed for local galaxies of similar properties. Moreover, at z~3, we
observe that the masses at which a halo hosts, on average, one satellite and
one central galaxy is M$_1$$\approx$4M$_{min}$ over all luminosity ranges,
significantly lower than observed at z~0 indicating that the halo satellite
occupation increases with redshift. The luminosity and stellar mass dependence
is also reflected in the measurements of the large scale galaxy bias, which we
model as b$_{g,HOD}$($>$L)=1.92+25.36(L/L$^*$)$^{7.01}$. We conclude our study
with measurements of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR).

MBL phase. It is further supported by numerical calculations of level
statistics which changes from Wigner-Dyson ($r$$<$$r_c$) to Poisson
($r$$>$$r_c$) distributions. Note that no subdiffusive phase intervenes between
diffusive and MBL phases. Moreover, the critical exponent $\nu$=0, violating
the Harris criterion. Our higher-dimensional SYK model may provide a promising

prominent sites of star-formation and dust obscuration. However, spiral
structure can take many forms: from galaxies displaying two strong `grand
design' arms, to those with many `flocculent' arms. We investigate how these
different arm types are related to a galaxy's star-formation and gas properties
by making use of visual spiral arm number measurements from Galaxy Zoo 2. We
combine UV and mid-IR photometry from GALEX and WISE to measure the rates and
relative fractions of obscured and unobscured star formation in a sample of
low-redshift SDSS spirals. Total star formation rate has little dependence on
spiral arm multiplicity, but two-armed spirals convert their gas to stars more
efficiently. We find significant differences in the fraction of obscured
star-formation: an additional $\sim 10$ per cent of star-formation in two-armed
galaxies is identified via mid-IR dust emission, compared to that in many-armed
galaxies. The latter are also significantly offset below the IRX-$\beta$
relation for low-redshift star-forming galaxies. We present several
explanations for these differences versus arm number: variations in the spatial
distribution, sizes or clearing timescales of star-forming regions (i.e.,
molecular clouds), or contrasting recent star-formation histories.

terms of the axion branching ratios. We show that MEP strongly constrains the
axion mass taking into account the current experimental bounds on the neutrinos
masses. Assuming that the axion is massive enough to decay into all the three
neutrinos and that MEP fixes all the free parameters of the model, the inferred
axion mass is in the interval $0.1\ $eV$\ <m_{A}<0.2$ eV, which can be tested
by forthcoming experiments such as IAXO. However, even in the case where MEP
fixes just the axion mass and no other parameter, we found that $0.1$ eV $< m_A
< 6.3$ eV in the DFSZ model with right-handed neutrinos. Moreover, a light
axion, allowed to decay to photons and the lightest neutrino only, is
determined by MEP as a viable dark matter candidate.

B, whereby any function realized by B could be replicated by A, but there
exists functions realized by A, which cannot be replicated by B unless its size
grows significantly larger. For example, it is known that deep networks are
exponentially efficient with respect to shallow networks, in the sense that a
shallow network must grow exponentially large in order to approximate the
functions represented by a deep network of polynomial size. In this work, we
extend the study of expressive efficiency to the attribute of network
connectivity and in particular to the effect of ""overlaps"" in the convolutional
process, i.e., when the stride of the convolution is smaller than its filter
size (receptive field). To theoretically analyze this aspect of network's
design, we focus on a well-established surrogate for ConvNets called
Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvACs), and then demonstrate empirically
that our results hold for standard ConvNets as well. Specifically, our analysis
shows that having overlapping local receptive fields, and more broadly denser
connectivity, results in an exponential increase in the expressive capacity of
neural networks. Moreover, while denser connectivity can increase the
expressive capacity, we show that the most common types of modern architectures
already exhibit exponential increase in expressivity, without relying on
fully-connected layers.

redshifts for all galaxies in the population targeted. The missing galaxies are
often clustered, commonly leading to a lower proportion of successful
observations in dense regions. One example is the close-pair issue for SDSS
spectroscopic galaxy surveys, which have a deficit of pairs of observed
galaxies with angular separation closer than the hardware limit on placing
neighbouring fibers. Spatially clustered missing observations will exist in the
next generations of surveys. Various schemes have previously been suggested to
mitigate these effects, but none works for all situations. We argue that the
solution is to link the missing galaxies to those observed with statistically
equivalent clustering properties, and that the best way to do this is to rerun
the targeting algorithm, varying the angular position of the observations.
Provided that every pair has a non-zero probability of being observed in one
realisation of the algorithm, then a pair-upweighting scheme linking targets to
successful observations, can correct these issues. We present such a scheme,
and demonstrate its validity using realisations of an idealised simple survey
strategy.

design of energy-efficient and fast signal processing systems. As its
complexity grows exponentially with the number of output bits, significant
savings are possible when resorting to a minimum resolution of a single bit.
However, then the nonlinear effect which is introduced by the A/D converter
results in a pronounced performance loss, in particular for the case when the
receiver is operated outside the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. By
trading the A/D resolution for a moderately faster sampling rate, we show that
for time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation under any SNR level it is possible to
obtain a low-complexity $1$-bit receive system which features a smaller
performance degradation then the classical low SNR hard-limiting loss of
$2/\pi$ ($-1.96$ dB). Key to this result is the employment of a lower bound for
the Fisher information matrix which enables us to approximate the estimation
performance for coarsely quantized receivers with correlated noise models in a
pessimistic way.

hypotheses about many outcomes or many treatments. To be credible an
observational study that tests many causal hypotheses must demonstrate that its
conclusions are neither artifacts of multiple testing nor of small biases from
nonrandom treatment assignment. In a sense that needs to be defined carefully,
hidden within a sensitivity analysis for nonrandom assignment is an enormous
correction for multiple testing: in the absence of bias, it is extremely
improbable that multiple testing alone would create an association insensitive
to moderate biases. We propose a new strategy called ""cross-screening"",
different from but motivated by recent work of Bogomolov and Heller on
replicability. Cross-screening splits the data in half at random, uses the
first half to plan a study carried out on the second half, then uses the second
half to plan a study carried out on the first half, and reports the more
favorable conclusions of the two studies correcting using the Bonferroni
inequality for having done two studies. If the two studies happen to concur,
then they achieve Bogomolov-Heller replicability; however, importantly,
replicability is not required for strong control of the family-wise error rate,
and either study alone suffices for firm conclusions. In randomized studies
with a few hypotheses, cross-split screening is not an attractive method when
compared with conventional methods of multiplicity control, but it can become
attractive when hundreds or thousands of hypotheses are subjected to
sensitivity analyses in an observational study. We illustrate the technique by
comparing 46 biomarkers in individuals who consume large quantities of fish

  Extraction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","This manuscripts has been submitted to TMI",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain extraction or whole brain segmentation is an important first step in
many of the neuroimage analysis pipelines. The accuracy and robustness of brain
extraction, therefore, is crucial for the accuracy of the entire brain analysis
process. With the aim of designing a learning-based, geometry-independent and
registration-free brain extraction tool in this study, we present a technique
based on an auto-context convolutional neural network (CNN), in which intrinsic
local and global image features are learned through 2D patches of different
window sizes. In this architecture three parallel 2D convolutional pathways for
three different directions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) implicitly learn 3D
image information without the need for computationally expensive 3D
convolutions. Posterior probability maps generated by the network are used
iteratively as context information along with the original image patches to
learn the local shape and connectedness of the brain, to extract it from
non-brain tissue.
  The brain extraction results we have obtained from our algorithm are superior
to the recently reported results in the literature on two publicly available
benchmark datasets, namely LPBA40 and OASIS, in which we obtained Dice overlap
coefficients of 97.42% and 95.40%, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the
performance of our algorithm in the challenging problem of extracting
arbitrarily-oriented fetal brains in reconstructed fetal brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. In this application our algorithm performed
much better than the other methods (Dice coefficient: 95.98%), where the other
methods performed poorly due to the non-standard orientation and geometry of
the fetal brain in MRI. Our CNN-based method can provide accurate,
geometry-independent brain extraction in challenging applications.

magnetic field strength and structure, assuming the polarization of the lines
originates from the Zeeman effect, and that of the dust originates from aligned
dust grains. We also discuss other effects that could give rise to the observed
polarization.
  We detect, for the first time, significant polarization (~3%) of the
circumstellar dust emission at millimeter wavelengths. The polarization is
uniform with an electric vector position angle of $\sim8^\circ$. Varying levels
of linear polarization are detected for the J=4-3 28SiO v=0, 1, 2, and 29SiO
v=0, 1 lines, with the strongest polarization fraction of ~30% found for the
29SiO v=1 maser. The linear polarization vectors rotate with velocity,
consistent with earlier observations. We also find significant (up to ~1%)
circular polarization in several lines, consistent with previous measurements.
We conclude that the detection is robust against calibration and regular
instrumental errors, although we cannot yet fully rule out non-standard
instrumental effects.
  Emission from magnetically aligned grains is the most likely origin of the
observed continuum polarization. This implies that the dust is embedded in a
magnetic field >13 mG. The maser line polarization traces the magnetic field
structure. The magnetic field in the gas and dust is consistent with an
approximately toroidal field configuration, but only higher angular resolution
observations will be able to reveal more detailed field structure. If the
circular polarization is due to Zeeman splitting, it indicates a magnetic field
strength of ~1-3 Gauss, consistent with previous maser observations.

theoretical study is presented that analytically proves the correlation between
the localization error and the number of connected vehicles in two cases of

simultaneously estimate temporal variations in both the dispersion measure (DM)
and scattering, together with a model for the pulse profile that includes
smooth evolution as a function of frequency, and the pulsar's timing model. We
show that fixing the scattering timescales when forming time-of-arrival
estimates, as has been suggested in the context of traditional pulsar timing
analysis, can significantly underestimate the uncertainties in both DM, and the
arrival time of the pulse, leading to bias in the timing parameters. We apply
our method using a new, publicly available, GPU accelerated code, both to
simulations, and observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1643$-$1224. This
pulsar is known to exhibit significant scattering variability compared to
typical millisecond pulsars, and we find including low-frequency ($< 1$ GHz)
data without a model for these scattering variations leads to significant
periodic structure in the DM, and also biases the astrometric parameters at the
$4\sigma$ level, for example, changing proper motion in right ascension by
$0.50 \pm 0.12$. If low frequency observations are to be included when
significant scattering variations are present, we conclude it is necessary to
not just model those variations, but also to sample the parameters that
describe the variations simultaneously with all other parameters in the model,

no longer valid in its usual form. A contribution related to microscopic spin
should be considered. 2)The electromagnetic dipolar energy density contributes
to the inertia of matter and should be incorporated covariantly to the the
energy-momentum tensor of matter. Then there is an electromagnetic component in
matter's momentum density whose variation explains the results of the only
experiment which supports Abraham's force. 3)Averaging the microscopic
Lorentz's force results in the unambiguos expression for the force density
exerted by the field. This force density is consistent with all the
experimental evidence. 4)Momentum conservation determines the electromagnetic
energy-momentum tensor. This tensor is different from Abraham's and Minkowski's
tensors, but one recovers Minkowski's expression for the momentum density. The
energy density is different from Poynting's expression but Poynting's vector
remains the same. Our tensor is non-symmetric which allows the field to exert a
distributed torque on matter. We use our results to discuss momentum and
angular momentum exchange in various situations of physical interest. We find
complete consistency of our equations in the description of the systems
considered. We also show that several alternative expressions of the field
energy-momentum tensor and force-density cannot be successfully used in all our

observations of the 2013 outburst of the black hole candidate X-ray binary
system J1908+094, using data from the VLBA and EVN. We show that following a
hard-to-soft state transition, we detect moving jet knots that appear
asymmetric in morphology and brightness, and expand to become laterally
resolved as they move away from the core, along an axis aligned approximately
$-11$\degree\ east of north. We initially see only the southern component,
whose evolution gives rise to a 15-mJy radio flare and generates the observed
radio polarization. This fades and becomes resolved out after 4 days, after
which a second component appears to the north, moving in the opposite
direction. From the timing of the appearance of the knots relative to the X-ray
state transition, a 90\degree\ swing of the inferred magnetic field
orientation, the asymmetric appearance of the knots, their complex and evolving
morphology, and their low speeds, we interpret the knots as working surfaces
where the jets impact the surrounding medium. This would imply a substantially
denser environment surrounding XTE J1908+094 than has been inferred to exist
around the microquasar sources GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40.

  non-homogeneous Poisson process models","cleaned up figures and text",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data of the form of event times arise in various applications. A simple model
for such data is a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) which is specified by
a rate function that depends on time. We consider the problem of having access
to multiple independent observations of event time data, observed on a common
interval, from which we wish to classify or cluster the observations according
to their rate functions. Each rate function is unknown but assumed to belong to
a finite number of rate functions each defining a distinct class. We model the
rate functions using a spline basis expansion, the coefficients of which need
to be estimated from data. The classification approach consists of using
training data for which the class membership is known, to calculate maximum
likelihood estimates of the coefficients for each group, then assigning test
observations to a group by a maximum likelihood criterion. For clustering, by
analogy to the Gaussian mixture model approach for Euclidean data, we consider
mixtures of NHPP and use the expectation-maximisation algorithm to estimate the
coefficients of the rate functions for the component models and group
membership probabilities for each observation. The classification and
clustering approaches perform well on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

applications. In the spatio-temporal setting, several families of covariance
functions exist to accommodate a wide variety of dependence structures arising
in different applications. These parametric families can be restrictive and are
insufficient in some situations. In contrast, process convolutions represent a
flexible, interpretable approach to defining the covariance of a Gaussian
process and have modest requirements to ensure validity. We introduce a
generalization of the process convolution approach that employs multiple
convolutions sequentially to form a ""process convolution chain."" In our
proposed multi-stage framework, complex dependencies that arise from a
combination of different interacting mechanisms are decomposed into a series of
interpretable kernel smoothers. We demonstrate an application of process
convolution chains to model killer whale movement, in which the paths taken by
multiple individuals are not independent, but reflect dynamic social
interactions within the population. Our proposed model for dependent movement
provides inference for the latent dynamic social structure in the study
population. Additionally, by leveraging the positive dependence among
individual paths, we achieve a reduction in uncertainty for the estimated
locations of the whales, compared to a model that treats paths as independent.

effects is deemed to be impossible. We argue that this ""impossibility"" can
indeed be resolved by employing a new approach which consists of
reparametrization of effects and exploitation of effect non-orthogonality. This
approach is successfully applied to three classes of designs: regular and
nonregular two-level fractional factorial designs, and three-level fractional
factorial designs. For reparametrization, the notion of conditional main
effects (cme's) is employed for two-level regular designs, while the
linear-quadratic system is used for three-level designs. For nonregular
two-level designs, reparametrization is not needed because the partial aliasing
of their effects already induces non-orthogonality. The approach can be
extended to general observational data by using a new bi-level variable
selection technique based on the cme's. A historical recollection is given on
how these ideas were discovered.

support a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution. The results
agree with experimental data and compare very well to solutions of the phonon
Boltzmann transport equation in the diffusive and weakly quasi-ballistic

incorrectly. However, symmetry-projected mean-field wave functions do not

in terms of low-order ones is guided by symmetry projection and is not
exponential, and combine them with coupled cluster theory in order to model the
ground state of the Agassi Hamiltonian. This model has two separate channels of

a fleet of shared vehicles that can be automatically positioned in response to
customer demand. Recent approaches to MOD systems have focused on environments
where customers can only request rides through an app or by waiting at a
station. This paper develops MOD fleet management approaches for ride hailing,
where customers may instead request rides simply by hailing a passing vehicle,
an approach of particular importance for campus MOD systems. The challenge for
ride hailing is that customer demand is not explicitly provided as it would be
with an app, but rather customers are only served if a vehicle happens to be
located at the arrival location. This work focuses on maximizing the number of
served hailing customers in an MOD system by learning and utilizing customer
demand. A Bayesian framework is used to define a novel customer demand model
which incorporates observed pedestrian traffic to estimate customer arrival
locations with a quantification of uncertainty. An exploration planner is
proposed which routes MOD vehicles in order to reduce arrival rate uncertainty.
A robust ride hailing fleet management planner is proposed which routes
vehicles under the presence of uncertainty using a chance-constrained
formulation. Simulation of a real-world MOD system on MIT's campus demonstrates
the effectiveness of the planners. The customer demand model and exploration
planner are demonstrated to reduce estimation error over time and the ride
hailing planner is shown to improve the fraction of served customers in the
system by 73\% over a baseline exploration approach.

governed by the magnetic field while the neutral particles can only feel the
magnetic field's Lorentz force indirectly through collisions with ions. The
drift in the velocity between ionized and neutral species plays a key role in
modifying important physical processes like magnetic reconnection, damping of
magnetohydrodynamic waves, transport of angular momentum in plasma through the
magnetic field, and heating. This paper investigates the differences between
Doppler velocities of calcium ions and neutral hydrogen in a solar prominence
to look for velocity differences between the neutral and ionized species. We
simultaneously observed spectra of a prominence over an active region in H I
397 nm, H I 434 nm, Ca II 397 nm, and Ca II 854 nm using a high dispersion
spectrograph of the Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida observatory, and compared
the Doppler velocities, derived from the shift of the peak of the spectral
lines presumably emitted from optically-thin plasma. There are instances when
the difference in velocities between neutral atoms and ions is significant,
e.g. 1433 events (~ 3 % of sets of compared profiles) with a difference in
velocity between neutral hydrogen atoms and calcium ions greater than 3sigma of
the measurement error. However, we also found significant differences between
the Doppler velocities of two spectral lines emitted from the same species, and
the probability density functions of velocity difference between the same
species is not significantly different from those between neutral atoms and
ions. We interpreted the difference of Doppler velocities as a result of
motions of different components in the prominence along the line of sight,
rather than the decoupling of neutral atoms from plasma.

already achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement, we
performed an independent set of human performance measurements on two

M$_{\odot}$/yr and the stellar mass of ~10$^{10}$-10$^{11.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We
homogeneously derive Re(FIR) and FIR luminosity L_FIR of our ALMA sources via
the same uv-visibility method with the exponential disk fitting, carefully

Re(FIR) and L_FIR at the >99% significance level. The best-fit power-law
function, Re(FIR) $\propto$ L_FIR$^{\alpha}$, provides $\alpha=0.28+/-0.07$,

redshifts. The best-fit $\alpha$ and the redshift evolution of Re(FIR) are
similar to those of the galaxy effective radius in the rest-frame UV (optical)
wavelength Re(UV) (Re(Opt.)) revealed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) studies.
We identify that our ALMA sources have significant trends of Re(FIR) <~ Re(UV)

Moreover, Re(FIR) of our ALMA sources is comparable to Re(Opt.) of quiescent
galaxies at z~1-3 as a function of stellar mass, supporting the evolutionary
connection between these two galaxy populations. We also investigate rest-frame
UV and optical morphologies of our ALMA sources with deep HST images, and find
that ~30-40% of our ALMA sources are classified as major mergers. This
indicates that dusty starbursts are triggered not only by the major mergers but

eavesdropper. Stochastic encryption is employed as a counter measure that flips
the quantization bits at each sensor according to certain probabilities, and
the flipping probabilities are only known to the legitimate fusion center (LFC)
but not the eavesdropping fusion center (EFC). As a result, the LFC employs the
optimal sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for sequential detection
whereas the EFC employs a mismatched SPRT (MSPRT). We characterize the
asymptotic performance of the MSPRT in terms of the expected sample size as a
function of the vanishing error probabilities. We show that when the detection
error probabilities are set to be the same at the LFC and EFC, every symmetric
stochastic encryption is ineffective in the sense that it leads to the same
expected sample size at the LFC and EFC. Next, in the asymptotic regime of
small detection error probabilities, we show that every stochastic encryption
degrades the performance of the quantized sequential detection at the LFC by
increasing the expected sample size, and the expected sample size required at
the EFC is no fewer than that is required at the LFC. Then the optimal
stochastic encryption is investigated in the sense of maximizing the difference
between the expected sample sizes required at the EFC and LFC. Although this
optimization problem is nonconvex, we show that if the acceptable tolerance of
the increase in the expected sample size at the LFC induced by the stochastic
encryption is small enough, then the globally optimal stochastic encryption can
be analytically obtained; and moreover, the optimal scheme only flips one type
of quantized bits (i.e., 1 or 0) and keeps the other type unchanged.

upon existing motif methods in terms of the discriminative utility of the

Compared to their contextless counterparts, these contextual motifs led to
better predictions of hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Our results suggest that

of mobile LiDAR point clouds. We perform the hierarchical clustering on
unorganized point clouds based on a proximity matrix. The dissimilarity measure
in the proximity matrix is calculated by the Euclidean distances between
clusters and the difference of normal vectors at given points. The main
contribution of this paper is that we succeed to optimize the combination of
clusters in the hierarchical clustering. The combination is obtained by
achieving the matching of a bipartite graph, and optimized by solving the
minimum-cost perfect matching. Results show that the proposed optimal
hierarchical clustering (OHC) succeeds to achieve the segmentation of multiple
individual objects automatically and outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR
point cloud segmentation approaches.

Therefore, it is essential to have a flexible access control model,
incorporating dynamically changing context information. Towards this end, this
paper introduces a policy framework for context-aware access control (CAAC)
applications that extends the role-based access control model with both dynamic
associations of user-role and role-permission capabilities. We first present a
formal model of CAAC policies for our framework. Using this model, we then
introduce an ontology-based approach and a software prototype for modelling and
enforcing CAAC policies. In addition, we evaluate our policy ontology model and
framework by considering (i) the completeness of the ontology concepts,
specifying different context-aware user-role and role-permission assignment
policies from the healthcare scenarios; (ii) the correctness and consistency of
the ontology semantics, assessing the core and domain-specific ontologies
through the healthcare case study; and (iii) the performance of the framework
by means of response time. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility
of our framework and quantify the performance overhead of achieving
context-aware access control to information resources.

Raman form-factors $\gamma(\vec k)$. In a BCS superconductor, a bare Raman
bubble is non-zero for any $\gamma(\vec k)$ and diverges at $\Omega = 2\Delta

The bending structure is composed of sub-wavelength unit cells with perforated
plates and side pipes, whose mass density and bulk modulus can be tuned
simultaneously. So the refraction index and the impedance of the acoustic bend
can be modulated simultaneously to guarantee both the bending effect and the
high transmission. The simulation results of sound pressure field distribution
show that the bending effect of the impedance matching acoustic bend is very
good. Transmission spectra of the impedance matching acoustic bend and the
acoustic bend composed of perforated plates only are both calculated for
comparison. The results indicate that the impedance matching acoustic bend is
successful in improving the impedance ratio and increasing the transmission

persistent compositional interfaces presents challenges, even to
state-of-the-art numerical methodology. For example, some numerical algorithms
for advecting the compositional interface cannot maintain a sharp compositional
boundary as the fluid migrates and distorts with time dependent fingering due
to the numerical diffusion that has been added in order to maintain the upper

thermally driven, compositional fields in mantle convection problems; namely,
an approach based on a high-order accurate finite element method advection
algorithm that employs an artificial viscosity technique to maintain the upper

advection algorithm and the advection of particles that carry a scalar quantity
representing the location of each compositional field. All four of these

spots$^{1,2}$. Meanwhile, strong electron localization$^{3}$ that endows
unparalleled electrical breakdown strengths to amorphous insulators is easily
compromised by local defects that promote inelastic tunneling over a variable
range$^{4,5}$. Here we report how metallic conduction can overcome strong
localization in amorphous insulators of small dimensions, and how local
structures can manifest their spectacular influence on such conduction. In
amorphous Si, nanoscale electrons are so coherent that they exhibit robust
quantum interferences reminiscent of the mesoscopic phenomena seen in weakly
localized metal crystals$^{6}$. Yet ultrasoft Si bonds emerge as the key local
structures whose extraordinarily strong electron-phonon interaction coerces
itinerant electrons into moving slowly at low temperature, even becoming
trapped at all temperature when Si-O/N sites are provided. The local structures
can be manipulated by a voltage or pressure to regulate charge storage, charge
flow and metal-insulator transition. Also made of Ge and oxides and nitrides,
nanostructured amorphous conductors could offer opportunities for new

layers, which are involved in deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional
neural networks (CNN), may not accurately characterize the local information of
speech signals, particularly with high frequency components, we employed fully
convolutional layers to model the waveform. More specifically, FCN consists of
only convolutional layers and thus the local temporal structures of speech
signals can be efficiently and effectively preserved with relatively few
weights. Experimental results show that DNN- and CNN-based models have limited
capability to restore high frequency components of waveforms, thus leading to
decreased intelligibility of enhanced speech. By contrast, the proposed FCN

the $U=\infty$ Hubbard model. We study three densities $n=.75,.8,.85$ that
correspond to a range between the overdoped and optimally doped Mott insulating
state. We delineate four distinct regimes characterized by different behaviors
of the resistivity $\rho$. We find at the lowest $T$ a Gutzwiller Correlated
Fermi Liquid regime with $\rho \propto T^2$ extending up to an effective Fermi
temperature that is dramatically suppressed from the non-interacting value.
This is followed by a Gutzwiller Correlated Strange Metal regime with $\rho
\propto (T-T_0)$, i.e. a linear resistivity extrapolating back to $\rho=0$ at a
positive $T_0$. At a higher $T$ scale, this crosses over into the Bad Metal
regime with $\rho \propto (T+T_1)$ extrapolating back to a finite resistivity
at $T=0$, and passing through the Ioffe-Regel-Mott value where the mean free
path is a few lattice constants. This regime finally gives way to the High $T$
Metal regime, where we find $\rho \propto T$. The present work emphasizes the
first two, where the availability of an analytical ECFL theory is of help in
identifying the changes in related variables entering the resistivity formula
that accompany the onset of linear resistivity, and the numerically exact DMFT
helps to validate the results. We also examine thermodynamic variables such as
the magnetic susceptibility, compressibility, heat capacity and entropy, and
correlate changes in these with the change in resistivity. This exercise casts
valuable light on the nature of charge and spin correlations in the strange
metal regime, which has features in common with the physically relevant strange
metal phase seen in strongly correlated matters.

to the termination of star formation in these galaxies and depletion of their
interstellar medium remain largely conjectural. In particular, there are
currently no direct measurements of the amount of residual gas that might be
still present in newly quiescent spheroids at high redshift. Here we show that
quiescent ETGs at z~1.8, close to their epoch of quenching, contained 2-3
orders of magnitude more dust at fixed stellar mass than local ETGs. This
implies the presence of substantial amounts of gas (5-10%), which was however
consumed less efficiently than in more active galaxies, probably due to their
spheroidal morphology, and consistently with our simulations. This lower star
formation efficiency, and an extended hot gas halo possibly maintained by
persistent feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN), combine to keep ETGs

$p$-orbitals inevitably generate a biquadratic coupling between the spins of
the $d$-orbitals. The key point revealed by our classical Monte Carlo
simulations and large-$N$ calculations is that the biquadratic term favors
local stripe-like magnetic fluctuations, which result in an enhanced nematic
susceptibility that onsets at a temperature scale determined by the effective
Heisenberg exchange $J$. We discuss the impact of this type of nematic order on
the magnetic spectrum and outline possible implications on our understanding of
nematicity in the cuprates.

extracting semantically related candidate queries from the original query and
(b) processing candidate queries and retrieving the top-k semantically related

with candidate keywords obtained from an ontological knowledge base. Candidate
results are scored using their cohesiveness and their similarity to the

on our pruning techniques. Further, we exploit a property of the candidate
queries to propose a technique for processing multiple queries in batch, which
improves the performance substantially. Extensive experiments on two real

classical ions, and the products of water autoionization, H$_3$O$^+$OH$^-$, or
water ions. We find that for both ion classes, the microscopic mechanism of
charge separation, including water's collective role in the process, is
conserved between the bulk liquid and the electrode interface. Despite this,
the thermodynamic and kinetic details of the process differ between these two
environments in a way that depends on ion type. In the case of the classical
ion pairs, a higher free energy barrier to charge separation and a smaller flux
over that barrier at the interface, results in a rate of dissociation that is
40x slower relative to the bulk. For water ions, a slightly higher free energy
barrier is offset by a higher flux over the barrier from longer lived hydrogen
bonding patters at the interface, resulting in a rate of association that is
similar both at and away from the interface. We find that these differences in
rates and stabilities of charge separation are due to the altered ability of
water to solvate and reorganize in the vicinity of the metal interface.

real-life observations that opinions are always diversified with no global or

themselves from dissenters. In this article, we show that, a simple model
integrating consensus formation, link rewiring and opinion change allows
complex system dynamics to emerge, driving the system into a dynamic
equilibrium with co-existence of diversified opinions. Specifically, similar
opinion holders may form into communities yet with no strict community
consensus; and rather than being separated into disconnected communities,
different communities remain to be interconnected by non-trivial proportion of
inter-community links. More importantly, we show that the complex dynamics may
lead to different numbers of communities at steady state with a given tolerance
between different opinion holders. We construct a framework for theoretically
analyzing the co-evolution process. Theoretical analysis and extensive
simulation results reveal some useful insights into the complex co-evolution
process, including the formation of dynamic equilibrium, the phase transition

exchange spectra of a valued cluster quiver and its full valued subquivers. The
key point is to find some invariants from the spectrum theory under mutations

quivers and give a characterization of $2$-maximal cluster quivers via the
classification of oriented graphs of its mutation equivalence. Finally, as an

are charged leptons and $i\neq j$. This has been done in a model independent
(MI) way as well as in supersymmetric high scale seesaw models, in particular
Type I see-saw model. Lepton flavour violation (LFV) is generated by
non-diagonal entries in the mass matrix of the sleptons. In a first step we use
the model independent approach where LFV (off-diagonal entries in the mass
matrix) is introduced by hand while respecting the direct search constraints
from the charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) processes. In the second step
we use high scale see-saw models where LFV is generated via renormalization
group equations (RGE) from the grand unification scale (GUT) down to
electroweak scale. cLFV decays are the most restrictive ones and exclude a
large part of the parameter space for the MI as well as the high scale see-saw
scenarios. Due to very strict constraints from cLFV, it is difficult to find
large corrections to LFVHD. This applies in particular to $h \rightarrow \tau
\mu$ where hints of an excess have been observed. If this signal is confirmed,
it could not be explained with the models under investigation.

topic in astrophysics and plasma physics. In the past several authors have
explored the influence of along-field adiabatic focusing on parallel diffusion
of charged energetic particles. In this paper by using the Unified NonLinear
Transport (UNLT) theory developed by Shalchi (SH2010) and the method of He and
Schlickeiser (HS2014) we derive a new nonlinear perpendicular diffusion
coefficient for non-uniform background magnetic field. This formula
demonstrates that particle perpendicular diffusion coefficient is modified by
along-field adiabatic focusing. For isotropic pitch-angle scattering and weak
adiabatic focusing limit the derived perpendicular diffusion coefficient is
independent of the sign of adiabatic focusing characteristic length. For
two-component model we simplify the perpendicular diffusion coefficient up to
second order of the power series of adiabatic focusing characteristic quantity.
We find that the first order modifying factor is equal to zero and the sign of
the second one is determined by the energy of particles.

  Astron. Soc. Japan",,"10.1093/pasj/psx022",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In incorporating the effect of atmospheric turbulence in the broadening of
spectral lines, the so-called radial-tangential macroturbulence (RTM) model has
been widely used in the field of solar-type stars, which was devised from an
intuitive appearance of granular velocity field of the Sun. Since this model
assumes that turbulent motions are restricted to only radial and tangential
directions, it has a special broadening function with notably narrow width due
to the projection effect, the validity of which has not yet been confirmed in
practice. With an aim to check whether this RTM model adequately represents the
actual solar photospheric velocity field, we carried out an extensive study on
the non-thermal velocity dispersion along the line-of-sight (V_los) by
analyzing spectral lines at various points of the solar disk based on
locally-averaged as well as high spatial-resolution spectra, and found the
following results. First, the center-to-limb run of V_los derived from
ground-based low-resolution spectra is simply monotonic with a slightly
increasing tendency, which contradicts the specific trend (an appreciable peak
at theta~45 deg) predicted from RTM. Second, the V_los values derived from a
large number of spectra based on high-resolution space observation revealed to
follow a nearly normal distribution, without any sign of peculiar distribution
expected for the RTM case. These two observational facts indicate that the
actual solar velocity field is not such simply dichotomous as assumed in RTM,
but directionally more chaotic. We thus conclude that RTM is not an adequate
model at least for solar-type stars, which would significantly overestimate the
turbulent velocity dispersion by a factor of ~2. The classical Gaussian
macroturbulence model should be more reasonable in this respect.

of a novel instantiation of the C-TMLE template where the covariates are
pre-ordered. Its time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(p)$ as opposed to the original
$\mathcal{O}(p^2)$, a remarkable gain. We propose two pre-ordering strategies
and suggest a rule of thumb to develop other meaningful strategies. Because it
is usually unclear a priori which pre-ordering strategy to choose, we also
introduce another implementation/instantiation called SL-C-TMLE algorithm that
enables the data-driven choice of the better pre-ordering strategy given the

computational burden and relative performance of these algorithms were compared
in simulation studies involving fully synthetic data or partially synthetic

Google DeepMind, end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) is collecting
attentions. Although little is known, the author's group has propounded this
framework for around 20 years and already has shown various functions that
emerge in a neural network (NN) through RL. In this paper, they are introduced
again at this timing.
  ""Function Modularization"" approach is deeply penetrated subconsciously. The
inputs and outputs for a learning system can be raw sensor signals and motor
commands. ""State space"" or ""action space"" generally used in RL show the
existence of functional modules. That has limited reinforcement learning to
learning only for the action-planning module. In order to extend reinforcement
learning to learning of the entire function on a huge degree of freedom of a
massively parallel learning system and to explain or develop human-like
intelligence, the author has believed that end-to-end RL from sensors to motors
using a recurrent NN (RNN) becomes an essential key. Especially in the higher
functions, this approach is very effective by being free from the need to
decide their inputs and outputs.
  The functions that emerge, we have confirmed, through RL using a NN cover a
broad range from real robot learning with raw camera pixel inputs to
acquisition of dynamic functions in a RNN. Those are (1)image recognition,
(2)color constancy (optical illusion), (3)sensor motion (active recognition),
(4)hand-eye coordination and hand reaching movement, (5)explanation of brain
activities, (6)communication, (7)knowledge transfer, (8)memory, (9)selective
attention, (10)prediction, (11)exploration. The end-to-end RL enables the
emergence of very flexible comprehensive functions that consider many things in
parallel although it is difficult to give the boundary of each function
clearly.

determine efficiency and effectiveness. Two fundamental building blocks or
generating functions (GFs) for invariants are discovered, which are dot product
and vector product of point vectors in Euclidean space. The primitive
invariants (PIs) can be derived by carefully selecting different products of
GFs and calculating the corresponding multiple integrals, which translates
polynomials of coordinates of point vectors into geometric moments. Then the
invariants themselves are expressed in the form of product of moments. This

that Hu's seven well known GMIs in computer vision have a more deep structure,

uses, low order independent GMIs are of particular interest. In this paper, a

comparatively evaluates malware classification using both closed set and open

to much of the previous work, we employ a fine-grained recognition protocol, in
which the dataset is loosely open set -- i.e., recognizing individual intrusion
types -- e.g., ""sendmail"", ""snmp guess"", ..., etc., rather than more general
attack categories (e.g., ""DoS"",""Probe"",""R2L"",""U2R"",""Normal""). We also employ
two different classifier types -- Gaussian RBF kernel SVMs, which are not
theoretically guaranteed to bound open space risk, and W-SVMs, which are

offers superior performance under the open set regime, particularly as the cost
of misclassifying unknown classes at query time (i.e., classes not present in

cost of unknown as well as discussion of the ramifications of these findings in

world. Just recently, former President Obama accused the Russian government of
the leaking emails to Wikileaks and declared that the U.S. might be forced to
respond. While Russia denied involvement, it is clear that the U.S. has to take
some defensive measures to protect its data infrastructure. Insider threats
have been the cause of other sensitive information leaks too, including the
infamous Edward Snowden incident. Most of the recent leaks were in the form of
text. Due to the nature of text data, security classifications are assigned
manually. In an adversarial environment, insiders can leak texts through
E-mail, printers, or any untrusted channels. The optimal defense is to
automatically detect the unstructured text security class and enforce the
appropriate protection mechanism without degrading services or daily tasks.
Unfortunately, existing Data Leak Prevention (DLP) systems are not well suited
for detecting unstructured texts. In this paper, we compare two recent
approaches in the literature for text security classification, evaluating them
on actual sensitive text data from the WikiLeaks dataset.

focusing techniques have been developed, these systems require sophisticated
artificial structures, which limit their practical applications. This is
because the spatial control of acoustic phonon waves is not as straightforward
as photonics so there is a strong demand for an alternative approach. Here we
demonstrate a phononic time lens in a dispersive one-dimensional phononic
crystal waveguide, which enables the temporal control of phonon wave
propagation. Pulse focusing is realized at a desired time and position with
chirped input pulses that agree perfectly with the theoretical prediction. This
technique can be applied to arbitrary systems and will offer both an
improvement in time and spatial sensing resolution and allow the creation of a
highly intense strain field, enabling the investigation of novel nonlinear
phononic phenomena such as phononic solitons and rogue waves.

uniform space (gus) is a set X equipped with a family of generalised metrics on

reals satisfying zero self-distance law and triangle inequality.
  For a symmetric generalised uniform space, the localic completion lifts its
generalised uniform structure to a point-free generalised uniform structure.
This point-free structure induces a complete generalised uniform structure on
the set of formal points of the localic completion that gives the standard
completion of the original gus with Cauchy filters.
  We extend the localic completion to a full and faithful functor from the
category of locally compact uniform spaces into that of overt locally compact
completely regular formal topologies. Moreover, we give an elementary
characterisation of the cover of the localic completion of a locally compact
uniform space that simplifies the existing characterisation for metric spaces.

cannot explain its peaking at a specific composition. Our results reveal that
the high value of piezoelectric response for the MPB compositions in PSZT at

composition. The softening of elastic modulus facilitates the generation of
large piezoelectric strain and polarization on approaching the MPB composition

the emission characteristics of a given light source don't necessarily comply

the transformation of a given light distribution into a customized one. This is
achieved by secondary optical elements often sporting elaborate designs, where
the actual light source takes up only a small fraction of the system's volume.
Such designs limit the final light source to one permanent operation mode,
which can only be overcome by employing mechanically-adjustable optical
elements. Here, we show that organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) make
real-time regulation of a beam-shape possible, without relying on secondary

continuous tuning between strongly forward and strongly sideward emission,

In combination with additional optical elements, customizable and tunable

of a WG cavity coupled with an ultrathin fiber (500-700nm) may exhibit both
Lorentzian dips and peaks, depending on the gap between the fiber and the
microcavity. By considering the large scattering loss of off-resonant light
from the fiber within the coupling region, this phenomenon can be attributed to
partially resonant light bypassing the lossy scattering region via WG modes,
allowing it to be coupled both to and from the cavity, thence manifesting as
Lorentzian peaks within the transmission spectra, which implies the system
could be implemented within a bandpass filter framework.

forward as the standard counterexample: namely the Penrose room, the Livshits

a large class of planar billiard obstacles, not necessarily featuring ellipses,
that have dark regions, hidden sets, or a divided phase space. The main result
is that for any convex set $\mathcal{H}$, we can construct a convex, everywhere
differentiable billiard table $K$ (at any distance from $\mathcal{H}$) such
that trajectories leaving $\mathcal{H}$ always return to $\mathcal{H}$ after
one reflection. This billiard generalises the Bunimovich mushroom. As

Transfer (WPT) technology. To tackle this problem, either enlarging the

intuitively proposed way. However, the drastically important issue on the user
exposure of electromagnetic radiation is rarely considered while we try to
improve the efficiency of WPT. In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power
Beacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed
on a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation
level (SERL) requirement. In this model, three key questions are intended to be
answered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at
the users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of
WPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain
than the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of
DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation
power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL
published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the
closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user
in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order
to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed
antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the
typical value $2$ and $4$. For comparison, the CA-PB is also analyzed as a
benchmark. Simulation results verify our derived theoretical results. And it is
shown that the proposed DA-PB indeed achieves larger average harvested DC power
than CA-PB and can improve the efficiency of WPT.

experimental data with the results of a theoretical Floquet model. The utilized
60$D_J$ fine structure Floquet levels exhibit $J$- and $m_j$-dependent AC Stark
shifts and splittings, and develop even-order RF-modulation sidebands. The
Floquet map of cesium 60$D_J$ fine structure states exhibits a series of exact
crossings between states of different $m_j$, which are not RF-coupled. These
exact level crossings are employed to perform a rapid and precise ($\pm 0.5\%$)
calibration of the RF electric field. We also map out three series of narrow
avoided crossings between fine structure Floquet levels of equal $m_j$ and
different $J$, which are weakly coupled by the RF field via a Raman process.
The coupling leads to narrow avoided crossings that can also be applied as
spectroscopic markers for RF field calibration. We further find that the

semi-supervised learning (SSL). However, existing GANs in SSL have two
problems: (1) the generator and the discriminator (i.e. the classifier) may not
be optimal at the same time; and (2) the generator cannot control the semantics
of the generated samples. The problems essentially arise from the two-player
formulation, where a single discriminator shares incompatible roles of
identifying fake samples and predicting labels and it only estimates the data
without considering the labels. To address the problems, we present triple
generative adversarial net (Triple-GAN), which consists of three players---a
generator, a discriminator and a classifier. The generator and the classifier
characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels, and the
discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. We design
compatible utilities to ensure that the distributions characterized by the
classifier and the generator both converge to the data distribution. Our
results on various datasets demonstrate that Triple-GAN as a unified model can
simultaneously (1) achieve the state-of-the-art classification results among
deep generative models, and (2) disentangle the classes and styles of the input

possibility that the material of the ring originated in the disruption of a
satellite that had reached a critical distance from the centaur. We discuss the
conditions for the putative satellite to approach the centaur as a consequence
of tidal interaction. A three-body encounter is also considered as a transport
mechanism. In addition, we study the case in which the ring is formed by the
ejecta of a cratering collision on the centaur and we constrain the collision
parameters and the size of the resulting crater of the event. Finally, we
consider that the ring material originates from a catastrophic collision
between a background object and a satellite located at a distance corresponding
to the the current location of the ring. We compute the typical timescales for
these scenarios. We estimate that in order to be tidally disrupted a satellite
would have had to be larger than approximately 6.5 km at the location of the
rings. However the tidal interaction is rather weak for objects of the size of
outer solar system bodies at the ring location, therefore we considered other
more effective mechanisms by which a satellite migt have approached the
centaur. Collisonal scenarios are both physically plausible for the formation,
but semianalytical estimations indicate that the probability of the
corresponding collisions is low under current conditions

fundamental aspect of astronomical image processing. The presence of noise in
observed images makes deconvolution a nontrivial task that necessitates the use
of regularisation. This task is particularly difficult when the PSF varies
spatially as is the case for the Euclid telescope. New surveys will provide
images containing thousand of galaxies and the deconvolution regularisation
problem can be considered from a completely new perspective. In fact, one can
assume that galaxies belong to a low-rank dimensional space. This work
introduces the use of the low-rank matrix approximation as a regularisation
prior for galaxy image deconvolution and compares its performance with a
standard sparse regularisation technique. This new approach leads to a natural
way to handle a space variant PSF. Deconvolution is performed using a Python
code that implements a primal-dual splitting algorithm. The data set considered
is a sample of 10 000 space-based galaxy images convolved with a known
spatially varying Euclid-like PSF and including various levels of Gaussian
additive noise. Performance is assessed by examining the deconvolved galaxy
image pixels and shapes. The results demonstrate that for small samples of
galaxies sparsity performs better in terms of pixel and shape recovery, while
for larger samples of galaxies it is possible to obtain more accurate estimates
of the galaxy shapes using the low-rank approximation.

of finite temperature properties of solids. Here we use machine-learning
techniques to efficiently predict $F_{vib}$ and $S_{vib}$ of crystalline
compounds in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. By employing descriptors
based simply on the chemical formula and using a training set of only 300
compounds, mean absolute errors of less than 0.04 meV/K/atom (15 meV/atom) are
achieved for $S_{vib}$ ($F_{vib}$), whose values are distributed within a range
of 0.9 meV/K/atom (300 meV/atom.) In addition, for training sets containing
fewer than 2,000 compounds the chemical formula alone is shown to perform as
well as, if not better than, four other more complex descriptors previously
used in the literature. The accuracy and simplicity of the approach mean that
it can be advantageously used for the fast screening of phase diagrams or
chemical reactions at finite temperatures.

applying mechanically the chain rule to obtain an exact value for the desired
derivative. It has a cost in memory and cpu consumption. For participants of
financial markets (banks, insurances, financial intermediaries, etc), computing
derivatives is needed to obtain the sensitivity of its exposure to well-defined

increases the three different regimes previously reported in the literature are
recovered: homogeneous expansion of the bed, fluidized cavity in which
fluidization starts developing above the injection area, and finally the
chimney of fluidized grains when the fluidization zone reaches the free
surface. The analytical approach is at the continuum scale, based on Darcy's
law and Therzaghi's effective stress principle. It provides a good description
of the phenomenon as long as the porosity of the granular assembly remains
relatively homogeneous, i.e. for small injection rates. The numerical approach
is at the particle scale based on the coupled DEM-PFV method. It tackles the
more heterogeneous situations which occur at larger injection rates. The
results from both methods are in qualitative agreement with data published
independently. A more quantitative agreement is achieved by the numerical
model. A direct link is evidenced between the occurrence of the different
regimes of fluidization and the injection aperture. While narrow apertures let
the three different regimes be distinguished clearly, larger apertures tend to
produce a single homogeneous fluidization regime. In the former case, it is
found that the transition between the cavity regime and the chimney regime for
an increasing injection rate coincides with a peak in the evolution of inlet
pressure. Finally, the occurrence of the different regimes is defined in terms
of the normalized flux and aperture.

homological algebra in categories such as the category of sheaves of idempotent
modules over a topos. In the analogy with the development of homological
algebra for abelian categories the present paper should be viewed as the
analogue of the development of homological algebra for abelian groups. Our
selected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B
is the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the
semi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for
abelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the
conceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter
category Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution
and as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.
The three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with
the natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,
homological category in the sense of M. Grandis. Second, there is a far
reaching analogy between Bmod^s and the category of operators in Hilbert space,
and in particular results relating null kernel and injectivity for morphisms.
The third fundamental result is that, even for finite objects of Bmod^s the
resulting homological algebra is non-trivial and gives rise to a computable Ext
functor. We determine explicitly this functor in the case provided by the
diagonal morphism of the Boolean semiring into its square.

broadcasted by an access point (AP) in the downlink (DL). The node stores the

data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We investigate two simple online
transmission policies for the EH node, namely a best-effort policy and an
on-off policy, which do not require knowledge of the EH profile nor channel
knowledge. In particular, for both policies, the EH node transmits in each time
slot with a constant desired power if sufficient energy is available in its
energy buffer. Otherwise, the node transmits with the maximum possible power in
the best-effort policy and remains silent in the on-off policy. For both
policies, we use the theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to
analyze the limiting distribution of the stored energy for finite- and
infinite-size energy buffers. We provide this limiting distribution in closed
form for a Nakagami-m fading DL channel and analyze the outage probability for
a Nakagami-m fading UL channel. All derived analytical results are not limited
to EH via RF WPT but are applicable for any independent and identically
distributed EH process, originating from e.g. solar and wind energy. Our
results reveal that, for low outage probabilities, the best-effort policy is
superior to the on-off policy and the optimal constant UL transmit power of the
EH node that minimizes the outage probability is always less than the average
harvested power but increases with the capacity of the energy buffer. The
opposite behaviour is observed for high outage probabilities. Furthermore, we
show that the minimum outage probability of the two proposed policies closely
approaches the outage probability of the optimal offline power allocation

techniques such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are increasingly
being adopted. One of the main disadvantages of ABC in practical situations,
however, is that parameter inference must generally rely on summary statistics
of the data. This is particularly the case for problems involving
high-dimensional data, such as biological imaging experiments. However, some
summary statistics contain more information about parameters of interest than
others, and it is not always clear how to weight their contributions within the
ABC framework. We address this problem by developing an automatic, adaptive
algorithm that chooses weights for each summary statistic. Our algorithm aims
to maximize the distance between the prior and the approximate posterior by
automatically adapting the weights within the ABC distance function.
Computationally, we use a nearest neighbour estimator of the distance between
distributions. We justify the algorithm theoretically based on properties of
the nearest neighbour distance estimator. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm, we apply it to a variety of test problems, including several
stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks, and a spatial model of
diffusion, and compare our results with existing algorithms.

  We also study the randomness cost of our protocol in both one-shot and

regimes are predicted for different combinations of multiphoton absorption and

in the presence of the (necessary) linear gain. The solitons are stable too
against a certain (realistic) level of noise. Another essential finding is that
the quintic gain in the form of three-photon emission (3PE) offers an
alternative mechanism for supporting stable solitons, provided that it is not
too strong. The DSs coexist in low- and high amplitude forms, for a given value
of their width. The low-amplitude DS is stable, while its high-amplitude

to ensure the practical asymptotic and exponential stability. In contrast to

present here data from the archival plates of the Asiago Observatory, showing
the Orion field where the three EXors V1118, V1143, and NY are located. A total
of 484 plates were investigated, providing a total of more than 1000 magnitudes
for the three stars, which cover a period of about 35 yrs between 1959 to 1993.
We then compared our data with literature data. Apart from a newly discovered
flare-up of V1118, we identify the same outbursts already known, but we provide
two added values: (i) a long-term sampling of the quiescence phase; and (ii)
repeated multi-colour observations (BVRI bands). The former allows us to give a
reliable characterisation of the quiescence, which represents a unique
reference for studies that will analyze future outbursts and the physical
changes induced by these events. The latter is useful for confirming whether
the intermittent increases of brightness are accretion-driven (as in the case
of V1118), or extinction-driven (as in the case of V1143). Accordingly, doubts
arise about the V1143 classification as a pure EXor object. Finally, although
our plates do not separate NY Ori and the star very close to it, they indicate
that this EXor did not undergo any major outbursts during our 40 yrs of
monitoring.

Hence, in events of network component (node/link) failures, communication

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc., occur at
different places around the world, causing severe communication service
disruptions due to network component failures. Most of the previous works on
optical network survivability assume that the failures are going to occur in
future, and the network is made survivable to ensure connectivity in events of

are becoming more accurate. Earthquakes have been a major cause of
telecommunication service disruption in the past. Hence, the information
provided by the meteorological departments and other similar agencies of
different countries may be helpful in designing networks that are more robust
against earthquakes. In this work, we consider the actual information provided

occurred in the past in India, and propose a scheme to improve the

exerted by the cyclic dynamo magnetic field of the Sun penetrating over a skin
depth below the turbulent convection zone. Our goal is to assess under which
conditions (turbulence level in the tachocline, strength of the
dynamo-generated field, spreading mechanism) this scenario can be realized in
the solar tachocline. We develop a simplified 1D model of the upper tachocline
under the influence of an oscillating magnetic field imposed from above. The
turbulent transport is parametrized with enhanced turbulent diffusion (or
anti-diffusion) coefficients. Two main processes that thicken the tachocline
are considered; either turbulent viscous spreading or radiative spreading. An
extensive parameter study is carried out to establish the physical parameter
regimes under which magnetic confinement of the tachocline that is due to a
surface dynamo field can be realized. We have explored a large range of
magnetic field amplitudes, viscosities, ohmic diffusivities and thermal
diffusivities. We find that, for large but still realistic magnetic field
strengths, the differential rotation can be suppressed in the upper radiative
zone (and hence the tachocline confined) if weak turbulence is present (with an
enhanced ohmic diffusivity of $\eta > 10^{7-8} \, cm^2/s$), even in the

of two orthogonal modes excited at the two ports of the antenna. This means
that the antenna may simultaneously support two orthogonal channels, which
represents an interesting polarization diversity characteristics for wireless
communications. The double asymmetric (DA) unit cell combines a circularly

provides equal radiation in the series and shunt modes while the latter

devise a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation

made of early-type stars able to accelerate particles up to relativistic
velocities. The relativistic particles can interact with different fields
(magnetic or radiation) in the colliding-wind region and produce non-thermal
emission. In many cases, non-thermal synchrotron radiation might be observable
and thus constitute an indicator of the existence of a relativistic particle
population in these multiple systems. To date, the catalogue of PACWBs includes
about 40 objects spread over many stellar types and evolutionary stages, with
no clear trend pointing to privileged subclasses of objects likely to
accelerate particles. This paper aims at discussing critically some criteria
for selecting new candidates among massive binaries. The subsequent search for
non-thermal radiation in these objects is expected to lead to new detections of
particle accelerators. On the basis of this discussion, some broad ideas for
observation strategies are formulated. At this stage of the investigation of
PACWBs, there is no clear reason to consider particle acceleration in massive
binaries as an anomaly or even as a rare phenomenon. We therefore consider that
several PACWBs will be detected in the forthcoming years, essentially using
sensitive radio interferometers which are capable of measuring synchrotron
emission from colliding-wind binaries. Prospects for high-energy detections are
also briefly addressed.

constrain mass accretion rates ($\mdot$) onto supermassive black holes in the
centre of the Milky Way and in the centre of M87. We constructed general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models for these sources that qualitatively
well describe their spectra and radio/mm images invoking a coupled jet-disk
system. Using general relativistic polarized radiative transfer, we now also
model the observed mm rotation measure (RM) of M87. The models are tied to the
observed radio flux, however, electron temperature and accretion rate are
degenerate parameters and are allowed to vary. For the inferred low viewing
angles of the M87 jet, the RM is low even as the black hole $\mdot$ increases
by a factor of $\simeq100$. In jet-dominated models, the observed linear
polarization is produced in the forward-jet, while the dense accretion disk
depolarizes the bulk of the near-horizon scale emission which originates in the
counter-jet. In the jet-dominated models, with increasing $\mdot$ and
increasing Faraday optical depth one is progressively sensitive only to
polarized emission in the forward-jet, keeping the measured RM relatively
constant. The jet-dominated model reproduces a low net-polarization of
$\simeq1$ per cent and RMs in agreement with observed values due to Faraday
depolarization, however, with $\mdot$ much larger than the previously inferred
limit of $9\times10^{-4}\,\mdotu$. All jet-dominated models produce much higher
RMs for inclination angles $i\gtrsim30^\circ$, where the line-of-sight passes

recognition tasks, as a vast amount of data with noisy labels are relatively
easy to obtain. Traditionally, the label noises have been treated as
statistical outliers, and approaches such as importance re-weighting and
bootstrap have been proposed to alleviate the problem. According to our
observation, the real-world noisy labels exhibit multi-mode characteristics as
the true labels, rather than behaving like independent random outliers. In this
work, we propose a unified distillation framework to use side information,
including a small clean dataset and label relations in knowledge graph, to
""hedge the risk"" of learning from noisy labels. Furthermore, unlike the
traditional approaches evaluated based on simulated label noises, we propose a
suite of new benchmark datasets, in Sports, Species and Artifacts domains, to
evaluate the task of learning from noisy labels in the practical setting. The
empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method in all
the domains.

magnetic fields to a lower energy state, and is manifested in several forms,
including bulk kinetic energy of the coronal mass ejection, acceleration of
electrons and ions, and enhanced thermal energy that is ultimately radiated
away across the electromagnetic spectrum from optical to X-rays. Using an
unprecedented set of coordinated observations, from a suite of instruments, we
here report on a hitherto largely overlooked energy component -- the kinetic
energy associated with small-scale turbulent mass motions. We show that the
spatial location of, and timing of the peak in, turbulent kinetic energy
together provide persuasive evidence that turbulent energy may play a key role
in the transfer of energy in solar flares. Although the kinetic energy of
turbulent motions accounts, at any given time, for only $\sim (0.5-1)$\% of the
energy released, its relatively rapid ($\sim$$1-10$~s) energization and
dissipation causes the associated throughput of energy (i.e., power) to rival
that of major components of the released energy in solar flares, and thus
presumably in other astrophysical acceleration sites.

the underlying aspects of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based
localization in UNB long-range IoT networks such as Sigfox. Firstly, the RSSI
has been used for fingerprinting localization where RSSI measurements of GPS
anchor nodes have been used as landmarks to classify other nodes into one of
the GPS nodes classes. Through measurements we show that a location
classification accuracy of 100% is achieved when the classes of nodes are
isolated. When classes are approaching each other, our measurements show that
we can still achieve an accuracy of 85%. Furthermore, when the density of the
GPS nodes is increasing, we can rely on peer-to-peer triangulation and thus
improve the possibility of localizing nodes with an error less than 20m from
20% to more than 60% of the nodes in our measurement scenario. 90% of the nodes
is localized with an error of less than 50m in our experiment with
non-optimized anchor node locations.

Methods. We obtained interferometric observations for three RGB stars with the
MIRC instrument mounted at the CHARA interfer- ometer. We looked for
asymmetries on the stellar surfaces using limb-darkening models. Results. We
measured the apparent diameters of HD197989 (Epsilon Cyg) = 4.61+-0.02 mas,
HD189276 (HR7633) = 2.95+-0.01 mas, and HD161096 (Beta Oph) = 4.43+-0.01 mas.
We detected departures from the centrosymmetric case for all three stars with
the tendency of a greater effect for lower logg of the sample. We explored the
causes of this signal and conclude that a possible explanation to the
interferometric signal is the convection-related and/or the magnetic-related
surface activity. However, it is necessary to monitor these stars with new
observations, possibly coupled with spectroscopy, in order to firmly establish
the cause.

hyperuniform (isotropic) disordered two-dimensional (2D) phononic structures of
Pb cylinders in epoxy matrix. The phononic band gaps in hyperuniform disordered
phononic structures are comparable to band gaps of similar periodic structures,
for both out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations. A large number of localized
modes is identified near the band edges, as well as, diffusive transmission
throughout the rest of the frequency spectrum. Very high-Q cavity modes for
both out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations are formed by selectively removing
a single cylinder out of the structure. Efficient waveguiding with almost 100%
transmission trough waveguide structures with arbitrary bends is also
presented. We expand our results to thin three-dimensional layers of such
structures and demonstrate effective band gaps related to the respective 2D
band gaps. Moreover, the drop in the Q factor for the three-dimensional

particle systems from a microscopic viewpoint. In particular we discuss two
different discrete geometric constructions. We apply both of them to determine
non reversible transition rates corresponding to a fixed invariant measure. The
first one uses the equivalence of this problem with the construction of
divergence free flows on the transition graph. Since divergence free flows are
characterized by cyclic decompositions we can generate families of models from
elementary cycles on the configuration space. The second construction is a
functional discrete Hodge decomposition for translational covariant discrete
vector fields. According to this, for example, the instantaneous current of any
interacting particle system on a finite torus can be canonically decomposed in
a gradient part, a circulation term and an harmonic component. All the three
components are associated to functions on the configuration space. This
decomposition is unique and constructive. The stationary condition can be
interpreted as an orthogonality condition with respect to an harmonic discrete
vector field and we use this decomposition to construct models having a fixed
invariant measure.

models. There is no closed-form solution available for this problem, implying
that we are forced to use approximations. In this tutorial we will provide a
self-contained introduction to one of the state-of-the-art methods---the
particle Metropolis--Hastings algorithm---which has proven to offer a practical
approximation. This is a Monte Carlo based method, where the particle filter is
used to guide a Markov chain Monte Carlo method through the parameter space.
One of the key merits of the particle Metropolis--Hastings algorithm is that it
is guaranteed to converge to the ""true solution"" under mild assumptions,
despite being based on a particle filter with only a finite number of
particles. We will also provide a motivating numerical example illustrating the
method using a modeling language tailored for sequential Monte Carlo methods.
The intention of modeling languages of this kind is to open up the power of
sophisticated Monte Carlo methods---including particle
Metropolis--Hastings---to a large group of users without requiring them to know

growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in an oscillating coronal
loop. Methods - We modelled a standing kink wave in a density-enhanced loop
with the three dimensional (3-D), resistive magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d.
We conducted a parameter study on the viscosity and resistivity coefficients to
examine the effects of dissipation on the KHI. Results - Enhancing the
viscosity and resistivity acts to suppress the KHI. Larger values delay the
formation of the instability and, in some cases, prevent the onset completely.
This leads to the earlier onset of heating for smaller values of the transport
coefficients. We note that viscosity has a greater effect on the development of
the KHI than resistivity. Furthermore, when using anomalous resistivity, the
Ohmic heating rate associated with the KHI may be greater than that associated
with the phase mixing that occurs in an instability-suppressed regime (using
uniform resistivity). Conclusions - From our study, it is clear that the
heating rate crucially depends on the formation of small length scales
(influenced by the numerical resolution) as well as the values of resistivity
and viscosity. As larger values of the transport coefficients suppress the KHI,
the onset of heating is delayed but the heating rate is larger. As increased
numerical resolution allows smaller length scales to develop, the heating rate
will be higher even for the same transport coefficients.

equivalent descriptions of deconfined QCPs, and use these to address the
possibility of enlarged emergent symmetries in the low energy limit. The

several dualities for the deconfined QCP with ${\mathrm{SU}(2)}$ spin symmetry
which together make natural the emergence of a previously suggested $SO(5)$
symmetry rotating the N\'eel and VBS orders. These emergent symmetries are
implemented anomalously. The associated infra-red theories can also be viewed
as surface descriptions of 3+1D topological paramagnets, giving further insight

important challenge that must be addressed in, e.g., tracking scenarios with

filter (KF) can deteriorate in such applications because of the close relation
to the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, this paper describes the use of
Student's t distribution to develop robust, scalable, and simple filtering and
smoothing algorithms.
  After a discussion of Student's t distribution, exact filtering in linear
state-space models with t noise is analyzed. Intermediate approximation steps
are used to arrive at filtering and smoothing algorithms that closely resemble
the KF and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother except for a nonlinear
measurement-dependent matrix update. The required approximations are discussed
and an undesirable behavior of moment matching for t densities is revealed. A
favorable approximation based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler
divergence is presented. Because of its relation to the KF, some properties and
algorithmic extensions are inherited by the t filter. Instructive simulation

essential for the brain to be able to function optimally. In this paper we
study synchronization of phase oscillators on the most basic example of such a
network, namely, the hierarchical lattice. Each site of the lattice carries an
oscillator that is subject to noise. Pairs of oscillators interact with each
other at a strength that depends on their hierarchical distance, modulated by a
sequence of interaction parameters. We look at block averages of the
oscillators on successive hierarchical scales, which we think of as block
communities. In the limit as the number of oscillators per community tends to
infinity, referred to as the hierarchical mean-field limit, we find a
separation of time scales, i.e., each block community behaves like a single
oscillator evolving on its own time scale. We argue that the evolution of the
block communities is given by a renormalized mean-field noisy Kuramoto
equation, with a synchronization level that depends on the hierarchical scale
of the block community. We find three universality classes for the
synchronization levels on successive hierarchical scales, characterized in
terms of the sequence of interaction parameters.
  What makes our model specifically challenging is the non-linearity of the
interaction betweenthe oscillators. The main results of our paper therefore
come in three parts: (I) a conjecture about the nature of the renormalisation
transformation connecting successive hierarchical scales; (II) a truncation
approximation that leads to a simplified renormalization transformation; (III)
a rigorous analysis of the simplified renormalization transformation. We
provide compelling arguments in support of (I) and (II), but a full
verification remains an open problem.

strong nearest-neighbour correlations that lead to a strong reduction of active

physicochemical properties, and secondary structure. Secondly, hierarchical
features dimensionality reduction strategies were employed to improve the
performance furthermore. Currently, Pretata achieves 92.92% TATA- binding

threats of ever increasing sophistication. It is though surprisingly difficult
and costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to
the variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in
full. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of
labels can thus be seen as prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to
detect infected computers by observing their HTTP(S) traffic collected from
network sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while
relying on only minimal human input in model training phase. We propose a
discriminative model that makes decisions based on all computer's traffic
observed during predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is
trained on collected traffic samples over equally sized time window per large
number of computers, where the only labels needed are human verdicts about the
computer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training
the model itself recognizes discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to
individual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of
them. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, while the
learned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. In the
following we implement the discriminative model as a neural network with
special structure reflecting two stacked multi-instance problems. The main
advantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and
ability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types
(together with their detectors) which are typically visited by infected

have a simple model that could be developed into a quantitative theory. A
central issue in the understanding of liquids is to estimate the energy state
of liquids. Here, on the basis of our recent studies on crystal melting, we
show that the energy sate of liquids may be reasonably approximated by the
energy and volume of a vacancy. Consequently, estimation of the liquid state
energy is significantly simplified comparing with previous methods that
inevitably invoke many-body interactions. Accordingly, a possible equation of
state for liquids is proposed. On this basis, it seems that a simple model for
liquids is in sight.

study proposes a method to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of

generated from GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data.
The Vieilledent's AGB map of Madagascar was established using optical images,
with parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, climatic
variables, and field inventories. In the present study, first, GLAS LiDAR data
were used to obtain a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation)
estimation of AGB (GLAS AGB) covering Madagascar forested areas, with a density
of 0.52 footprint/km 2. Second, the difference between the AGB from the
Vieilledent's AGB map and GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location was
calculated, and additional spatially distributed correction factors were
obtained. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed by taking
into account the spatial structure of these additional correction factors to
provide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the
correction factor maps were summed to improve the Vieilledent's AGB map. The
results showed that the integration of GLAS data improves the precision of
Vieilledent's AGB map by approximately 7 t/ha. By integrating GLAS data, the
RMSE on AGB estimates decreases from 81 t/ha (R 2 = 0.62) to 74.1 t/ha (R 2 =
0.71). Most importantly, we showed that this approach using LiDAR data avoids
underestimating high biomass values (new maximum AGB of 650 t/ha compared to
550 t/ha with the first approach).

study the Casimir interactions between dielectric wires in a compact
formulation of Abelian gauge theory in two spatial dimensions. The model
possesses topological defects, instanton-like monopoles, which are known to be
responsible for nonperturbative generation of a mass gap and for a linear
confinement of electrically charged probes. Despite the model has no matter
fields, the Casimir energy depends on the value of the gauge coupling constant.
We show, both analytically and numerically, that in the strong coupling regime
the Abelian monopoles make the Casimir forces short-ranged. Simultaneously,
their presence increases the interaction strength between the wires at short
distances for certain range of values of the gauge coupling. The wires suppress
monopole density in the space between them compared to the density outside the
wires. In the weak coupling regime the monopoles become dilute and the Casimir
potential reduces to a known theoretical result which does not depend on the
gauge coupling.

the best decoding algorithm which effectively improves forward error correction
performance. HoweverViterbi decoder enhanced with NTCs is not yet designed to
work in storage media devices. Currently Reed Solomon (RS) Algorithm is almost
the dominant algorithm used in correcting error in storage media. Conversely,
recent studies show that there still exist low reliability of data in storage
media while the demand for storage media increases drastically. This study
proposes a design of the Soft Viterbi Algorithm decoder enhanced with
Non-transmittable Codewords (SVAD-NTCs) to be used in storage media for error
correction. Matlab simulation was used in this design in order to investigate
behavior and effectiveness of SVAD-NTCs in correcting errors in data retrieving
from storage media.Sample data of one million bits are randomly generated,
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) was used as data distortion model and
Binary Phase- Shift Keying (BPSK) was applied for simulation modulation.
Results show that,behaviors of SVAD-NTC performance increase as you increase
the NTCs, but beyond 6NTCs there is no significant change and SVAD-NTCs design
drastically reduce the total residual error from 216,878 of Reed Solomon to
23,900.

wireless channel is considered. The transmitter is capable of sensing the
current channel state, albeit at the cost of both energy and transmission time.
The EH transmitter aims to maximize its long-term throughput by choosing one of
the following actions: $i)$ defer its transmission to save energy for future
use, $ii)$ transmit reliably at a low rate, $iii)$ transmit at a high rate, and
$iv)$ sense the channel to reveal the channel state at a cost of energy and
transmission time, and then decide to defer or to transmit. The problem is
formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process with a belief on
the channel state. The optimal policy is shown to exhibit a threshold behavior
on the belief state, with battery-dependent threshold values. The optimal
threshold values and performance are characterized numerically via the value
iteration algorithm as well as a policy search algorithm that exploits the
threshold structure of the optimal policy. Our results demonstrate that,
despite the associated time and energy cost, sensing the channel intelligently
to track the channel state improves the achievable long-term throughput
significantly as compared to the performance of those protocols lacking this
ability as well as the one that always senses the channel.

injected into the adjacent layers. If the adjacent layer is a material with a
high spin orbit coupling, a considerable amount of charge voltage can be
generated via inverse spin Hall effect, allowing spin detection. Here we
develop the spin circuit representation of spin pumping. We then combine it

of materials with high spin-orbit coupling from spin pumping experiments. For
designing functional devices, it is important to determine the spin diffusion
length with sufficient accuracy from experimental results. An inaccurate
estimation of spin diffusion length also affects the estimation of other
parameters (e.g., spin mixing conductance, spin Hall angle) concomitantly. The
spin diffusion length for platinum (Pt) has been reported in literature in a
wide range of 0.5 - 14 nm, and particularly it is a constant value independent
of Pt's thickness. Here, the key reasonings behind such wide range of reported
values of spin diffusion length have been identified comprehensively.
Particularly, it is shown here that a thickness-dependent conductivity and spin
diffusion length is necessary to simultaneously match the experimental results
of effective spin mixing conductance and inverse spin Hall voltage due to spin
pumping. Such thickness-dependent spin diffusion length is tantamount to
Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism, which bodes well for transitional
metals. This conclusion is not altered even when there is significant
interfacial spin memory loss. Furthermore, the variations in the estimated
parameters are also studied, which is important for technological applications.

for both fundamental studies and potential technological applications. Here, we
review the recent developments on electric field-induced magnetization
switching in multiferroic heterostructures. Particularly, we study the dynamics
of magnetization switching between the two stable states in a shape-anisotropic
single-domain nanomagnet using stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation in the presence of thermal fluctuations. For magnetostrictive
nanomagnets in strain-coupled multiferroic composites, such study of
magnetization dynamics, contrary to steady-state scenario, revealed intriguing
new phenomena on binary switching mechanism. While the traditional method of
binary switching requires to tilt the potential profile to the desired state of
switching, we show that no such tilting is necessary to switch successfully
since the magnetization's excursion out of magnet's plane can generate a
built-in asymmetry during switching. We also study the switching dynamics in
multiferroic heterostructures having magnetoelectric coupling at the interface
and magnetic exchange coupling that can facilitate to maintain the direction of
switching with the polarity of the applied electric field. We calculate the
performance metrics like switching delay and energy dissipation during
switching while simulating LLG dynamics. The performance metrics turn out to be
very encouraging for potential technological applications.
