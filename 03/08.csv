stars in or near the stellar habitable zones, it has recently been suggested
that moons the size of Mars could offer abundant surface habitats beyond the
solar system. Several searches for such exomoons are now underway, and the
exquisite astronomical data quality of upcoming space missions and ground-based
extremely large telescopes could make the detection and characterization of
exomoons possible in the near future. Here we explore the effects of tidal
heating on the potential of Mars- to Earth-sized satellites to host liquid
surface water, and we compare the tidal heating rates predicted by tidal
equilibrium model and a viscoelastic model. In addition to tidal heating, we
consider stellar radiation, planetary illumination and thermal heat from the
planet. However, the effects of a possible moon atmosphere are neglected. We
map the circumplanetary habitable zone for different stellar distances in
specific star-planet-satellite configurations, and determine those regions
where tidal heating dominates over stellar radiation. We find that the
`thermostat effect' of the viscoelastic model is significant not just at large
distances from the star, but also in the stellar habitable zone, where stellar
radiation is prevalent. We also find that tidal heating of Mars-sized moons
with eccentricities between 0.001 and 0.01 is the dominant energy source beyond
3--5 AU from a Sun-like star and beyond 0.4--0.6 AU from an M3 dwarf star. The
latter would be easier to detect (if they exist), but their orbital stability
might be under jeopardy due to the gravitational perturbations from the star.

crystal temperature has been developed for the new I23 beamline at the Diamond
Light Source, a facility dedicated to macromolecular crystallography (MX) with
long-wavelength X-rays. The temperature is derived from the
temperature-dependant decay time constant of luminescence from a minuscule
scintillation sensor (0.05 mm3) located in very close proximity to the sample
under test. In this work we present the underlying principle of cryogenic
luminescence lifetime thermometry, discuss the features of the detection
method, the choice of temperature sensor and demonstrate how the temperature
monitoring system was integrated within the viewing system of the end-station
used for the visualisation of protein crystals. The thermometry system was
characterised using a Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) crystal scintillator that exhibits good
responsivity of the decay time constant as function of temperature over a wide
range (8-270 K). The scintillation sensor was calibrated and the uncertainty of
the temperature measurements over the primary operation temperature range of
the beamline (30-150 K) was assessed to be +-1.6 K. It has been shown that the
temperature of the sample holder, measured using the luminescence sensor,
agrees well with the expected value. The technique was applied to characterise
the thermal performance of different sample mounts that have been used in MX
experiments at the I23 beamline. The thickness of the mount is shown to have
the greatest impact upon the temperature distribution across the sample mount.
Altogether these tests and findings demonstrate the usefulness of the
thermometry system in highlighting the challenges that remain to be addressed
for the in-vacuum MX experiment to become a reliable and indispensable tool for
structural biology

demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of accurately detecting simple
buffer overruns. We also present in-depth analyses on how a memory network can
learn to understand the semantics in programming languages solely from raw

learning. This extends previous work that was for denoising only. The original
double sparsity dictionary learning algorithm is modified to track the traces
with missing data by defining a masking operator that is integrated into the
sparse representation of the dictionary. A weighted low-rank approximation
algorithm is adopted to handle the dictionary updating as a sparse recovery
optimization problem constrained by the masking operator. Compared to
traditional sparse transforms with fixed dictionaries that lack the ability to
adapt to complex data structures, the double-sparsity dictionary learning
method learns the signal adaptively from selected patches of the corrupted
seismic data while preserving compact forward and inverse transform operators.
Numerical experiments on synthetic seismic data indicate that this new method
preserves more subtle features in the dataset without introducing pseudo-Gibbs
artifacts when compared to other directional multiscale transform methods such

local $B-L$ symmetry breaking, there is a phenomenologically allowed range of
parameters where the Higgs field responsible for $B-L$ symmetry breaking leaves
a physical real scalar field with mass around GeV scale. This particle (denoted
here by $H_3$) is weakly mixed with the Standard Model Higgs field ($h$) with
mixing $\theta_1\lesssim m_{H_3}/m_h$, barring fine-tuned cancellation. In the
specific case when the $B-L$ symmetry is embedded into the TeV scale left-right
seesaw scenario, we show that the bounds on the $h-H_3$ mixing $\theta_1$
become further strengthened due to low energy flavor constraints, thus forcing
the light $H_3$ to be long lived, with displaced vertex signals at the LHC. The
property of left-right TeV scale seesaw models are such that they make the
$H_3$ decay to two photons as the dominant mode. This is in contrast with a
generic light scalar that mixes with the SM Higgs boson, which could also have
leptonic and hadronic decay modes with comparable or larger strength. We
discuss the production of this new scalar field at the LHC and show that it
leads to testable displaced vertex signals of collimated photon jets, which is
a new distinguishing feature of the left-right seesaw model. We also study a
simpler version of the model where the $SU(2)_R$ breaking scale is much higher
than the ${\cal O}$(TeV) $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scale, in which case the
production and decay of $H_3$ proceed differently, but its long lifetime
feature is still preserved for a large range of parameters. Thus, the search
for such long-lived light scalar particles provides a new way to probe TeV
scale seesaw models for neutrino masses at colliders.

confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering

contagion process. In particular, in case of uncorrelated and positive

facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between

between the two competing processes effect of reconnections and the chiral

excluded volume repulsion and interact with long and short range forces. When
an explicit Euler-Maruyama integration step is performed to take into account
the pairwise forces and Brownian motion, particle overlaps can appear. The
excluded volume property brings up the need for correcting these overlaps as
they happen, since predicting them is not feasible due to the random
displacement of Brownian particles. The proposed solution handles, at each time
step, a Delaunay triangulation of the particle positions because it allows us
to efficiently solve overlaps between particles by checking just their
neighborhood. The algorithm starts by generating a Delaunay triangulation of
the particle initial positions on CPU, but after that the triangulation is
always kept on GPU memory. We used a parallel edge-flip implementation to keep
the triangulation updated during each time step, checking previously that the
triangulation was not rendered invalid due to the particle displacements. The
algorithm is validated with two models of active colloidal particles. Upon
testing the parallel implementation of a long range forces simulation, the
results show a performance improvement of up to two orders of magnitude when

polyadic decomposition.
  We first show that the involved tensors are related by a linear
transformation, and that their CP decompositions and uniqueness properties are
closely related. This connection provides a way to better assess which of the
methods should be favored in certain problem settings, and may be a starting
point to unify the two approaches. Second, we show that taking into account the

the uniqueness properties of the decompositions and thus enlarges the

reaction we have chosen the hydrogenation of reduced graphite ($KC_8$) with
$H_2O$ and compared it with the corresponding exposure to $H_2$ and $O_2$. The
early stages of graphene hydrogenation are accompanied by the evolution of a
series of so far undiscovered D-bands ($D_1$-$D_5$). Using quantum mechanical

lattice vibrations in the neighborhood of the covalently bound addend.
Interestingly, the exposure of $KC_8$ to $H_2$ and $O_2$ didn't cause covalent
binding, but intercalation of molecular $H_2$ or partial oxidation,
respectively. A combination of $H_2O$ and $O_2$ treatment led to the formation
of additional hydroxyl (-OH) functionalities. The latter reaction represents a
very suitable model for the decomposition of graphenides under ambient

random orthogonal systems to quickly mix together the columns of a matrix

factorization which forgoes expensive pivoted QR steps in exchange for mixing
in advance, followed by a cheaper, unpivoted QR factorization. The mixing step
typically reduces the variability of the column norms, and in certain
experiments, allows us to compute an accurate factorization where a plain,
unpivoted QR performs poorly. We experiment with linear least-squares,
rank-revealing factorizations, and the QLP approximation, and conclude that our
randomized URV factorization behaves comparably to a similar randomized
rank-revealing URV factorization, but at a fraction of the computational cost.
Our experiments provide evidence that our proposed factorization might be

gravity. We use the holographically dual two-dimensional CFT on the torus and
the related modular symmetry in order to treat bulk black holes and conical

of the entanglement of the AdS_3 vacuum, (ii) scaling as area/volume of the
leading term of the perturbative expansion of S_E, (iii) exponential/periodic
behaviour of S_E, (iv) presence of unaccessible regions in the

analytics for the Internet of Things (IoT) has become the main force behind
many innovative solutions for our society's problems. This paper provides
practical explanations for the question ""why is the number of Big Data
applications that succeed and have an effect on our daily life so limited,

with examples taken from Smart Grids. We argue that ""noninvariants"" are the
most challenging issues in IoT applications, which can be easily revealed if we
use the term ""invariant"" to replace the more common terms such as
""information"", ""knowledge"", or ""insight"" in any Big Data for IoT research. From
our experience with developing Smart Grid applications, we produced a list of
""noninvariants"", which we believe to be the main causes of the gaps between Big
Data in a laboratory and in practice in IoT applications. This paper also
proposes Graph of Virtual Actors (GOVA) as a Big Data analytics architecture
for IoT applications, which not only can solve the noninvariants issues, but
can also quickly scale horizontally in terms of computation, data storage,
caching requirements, and programmability of the system.

photographer.
  Methods A deep learning framework was trained to grade the images
automatically. A large representative set of 7000 color fundus images were used
for the experiment which were obtained from the EyePACS that were made
available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis
experts were employed to categorize these images into Accept and Reject classes
based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR. A deep
learning framework was trained using 3428 images.
  Results A total of 3572 images were used for the evaluation of the proposed
method. The method shows an accuracy of 100% to successfully categorise Accept
and Reject images.
  Conclusion Image quality is an essential prerequisite for the grading of DR.
In this paper we have proposed a deep learning based automated image quality
assessment method in the context of DR. The method can be easily incorporated
with the fundus image capturing system and thus can guide the photographer
whether a recapture is necessary or not.

  viscosity and vertical diffusivity",,,,,"math.AP physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the 3D primitive equations of oceanic and
atmospheric dynamics with only horizontal eddy viscosities in the horizontal
momentum equations and only vertical diffusivity in the temperature equation.
Global well-posedness of strong solutions is established for any initial data
such that the initial horizontal velocity $v_0\in H^2(\Omega)$ and the initial
temperature $T_0\in H^1(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\Omega)$ with $\nabla_HT_0\in
L^q(\Omega)$, for some $q\in(2,\infty)$. Moreover, the strong solutions enjoy
correspondingly more regularities if the initial temperature belongs to
$H^2(\Omega)$. The main difficulties are the absence of the vertical viscosity
and the lack of the horizontal diffusivity, which, interact with each other,
thus causing the ""\,mismatching\,"" of regularities between the horizontal
momentum and temperature equations. To handle this ""mismatching"" of
regularities, we introduce several auxiliary functions, i.e., $\eta, \theta,
\varphi,$ and $\psi$ in the paper, which are the horizontal curls or some
appropriate combinations of the temperature with the horizontal divergences of
the horizontal velocity $v$ or its vertical derivative $\partial_zv$. To
overcome the difficulties caused by the absence of the horizontal diffusivity,
which leads to the requirement of some $L^1_t(W^{1,\infty}_\textbf{x})$-type a
priori estimates on $v$, we decompose the velocity into the
""temperature-independent"" and temperature-dependent parts and deal with them in
different ways, by using the logarithmic Sobolev inequalities of the
Br\'ezis-Gallouet-Wainger and Beale-Kato-Majda types, respectively.
Specifically, a logarithmic Sobolev inequality of the limiting type, introduced
in our previous work [12], is used, and a new logarithmic type Gronwall
inequality is exploited.

varieties. It has a simple basis (over Q) from projective spaces and its rank
is equal to the number of Chern invariants. As an application we study the
number of singular subvarieties satisfying given tangent conditions with a
fixed smooth divisor, where the subvariety is the zero locus of a section of a
vector bundle. We prove that the generating series gives a homomorphism from
the algebraic cobordism group to the power series ring. This implies that the
number of singular subvarieties with tangency conditions is governed by
universal polynomials of Chern numbers, when the vector bundle is sufficiently
ample. This result combines and generalizes the Caporaso-Harris and Vakil's
recursive formulae, Gottsche's conjecture, De Jonquiere's Formula and relative
node polynomials from tropical geometry.
  In the revised version, we allow the tangency conditions to be at assigned
and unassigned points and prove the existence of universal polynomials and a
formula for generating series. This completes the most general case of such
enumeration of singular varieties for any dimension. We also correct the proof
in Section 5, 6 when the divisor D is not irreducible, and Theorem 2.2. Typos

candidate for quantum emitter due to their narrow emission line resulting in
their indistinguishability. While many different quantum emitters have already
been used for excitation of various propagating plasmonic modes, the
corresponding exploitation of SiV centers remained so far uncharted territory.
Here, we report on excitation of surface plasmon modes supported by silver
nanowires using SiV centers in nanodiamonds. The coupling of SiV center
fluorescence to surface plasmons is observed, when a nanodiamond situated close
to a nanowire is illuminated by the pump, as radiated emission from the distal
nanowire end. The effect of coupling is also seen as a change in the SiV center
lifetime. Finally, we discuss possible avenues for strengthening the SiV center
coupling to surface plasmon modes.

(DFT) on Euclidean lattices in $\R^n$, that generalizes the $n$-th fold DFT of
the integer lattice $\Z^n$ to arbitrary lattices. This definition is not
applicable for every lattice, but can be defined on lattices known as
Systematic Normal Form (SysNF) introduced in \cite{ES16}. Systematic Normal
Form lattices are sets of integer vectors that satisfy a single homogeneous
modular equation, which itself satisfies a certain number-theoretic property.
Such lattices form a dense set in the space of $n$-dimensional lattices, and
can be used to approximate efficiently any lattice. This implies that for every
lattice $L$ a DFT can be computed efficiently on a lattice near $L$.
  Our proof of the statement above uses arguments from quantum computing, and
as an application of our definition we show a quantum algorithm for sampling
from discrete distributions on lattices, that extends our ability to sample
efficiently from the discrete Gaussian distribution \cite{GPV08} to any
distribution that is sufficiently ""smooth"". We conjecture that studying the
eigenvectors of the newly-defined lattice DFT may provide new insights into the
structure of lattices, especially regarding hard computational problems, like
the shortest vector problem.

specific hypotheses have been advanced about the relative difficulty of
particular kinds of opaque processes (Kiparsky 1971, 1973), and the kind of

this paper, we present a computationally implemented learning theory for one

opaque French tense-lax vowel alternations and the opaque interaction of
diphthong raising and flapping in Canadian English. We find that the difficulty
of opacity can be influenced by evidence for stratal affiliation: the Canadian
English case is easier if the learner encounters application of raising outside
the flapping context, or non-application of raising between words (i.e., <life>
with a raised vowel; <lie for> with a non-raised vowel).

superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit interactions, when a Zeeman magnetic
field breaks time-reversal symmetry. Their existence and robustness against
adiabatic changes is deeply related, via a bulk-edge correspondence, to
topological properties of the band structure. The present paper shows that the
spin-orbit may be responsible for topological transitions when the
superconducting system has an underlying sublattice structure, as it appears in
a dimerized Peierls chain, graphene, and phosphorene. These systems, which
belong to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes class D, are found to have an extra symmetry
that plays the role of the parity. It enables the characterization of the
topology of the particle-hole symmetric band structure in terms of band
inversions. The topological phase diagrams this leads to are then obtained
analytically and exactly. They reveal that, because of the underlying
sublattice structure, the existence of topological superconducting phases
requires a minimum doping fixed by the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit.
Majorana boundary quasiparticles are finally predicted to emerge when the Fermi
level lies in the vicinity of the bottom (top) of the conduction (valence) band
in semiconductors such as the dimerized Peierls chain and phosphorene. In a
two-dimensional topological superconductor based on (stretched) graphene, which
is semimetallic, Majorana quasiparticles cannot emerge at zero and low doping,
that is, when the Fermi level is close to the Dirac points. Nevertheless, they
are likely to appear in the vicinity of the van Hove singularities.

high redshifts to date. One high-redshift LoBAL QSO, J0122+1216, was recently
discovered at the Lijiang 2.4-m Telescope with an initial redshift
determination of 4.76. Aiming to investigate its physical properties, we
carried out follow-up observations in the optical and near-IR spectroscopy.
Near-IR spectra from UKIRT and P200 confirms that it is a LoBAL, with a new
redshift determination of $4.82\pm0.01$ based on the \mgii~ emission-line. The
new \mgii~ redshift determination reveals strong blueshifts and asymmetry of
the high-ionization emission lines. We estimated a black hole mass of $\sim
2.3\times 10^9 M_\odot$ and Eddington ratio of $\sim 1.0$ according to the
empirical \mgii-based single-epoch relation and bolometric correction factor.
It is possible that strong outflows are the result of an extreme quasar
environment driven by the high Eddington ratio. A lower limit on the outflowing
kinetic power ($>0.9\% L_{Edd}$) was derived from both emission and absorption
lines, indicating these outflows play a significant role in the feedback
process to regulate the growth of its black hole as well as host galaxy
evolution.

applying a state-of-the-art object detector in real time (i.e., 30+ frames per

NoScope, a system for querying videos that can reduce the cost of neural
network video analysis by up to three orders of magnitude via
inference-optimized model search. Given a target video, object to detect, and
reference neural network, NoScope automatically searches for and trains a
sequence, or cascade, of models that preserves the accuracy of the reference
network but is specialized to the target video and are therefore far less
computationally expensive. NoScope cascades two types of models: specialized
models that forego the full generality of the reference model but faithfully
mimic its behavior for the target video and object; and difference detectors
that highlight temporal differences across frames. We show that the optimal
cascade architecture differs across videos and objects, so NoScope uses an
efficient cost-based optimizer to search across models and cascades. With this
approach, NoScope achieves two to three order of magnitude speed-ups
(265-15,500x real-time) on binary classification tasks over fixed-angle webcam

evolution of proximity zone sizes with redshift, and argued that this provides
evidence for a rapidly evolving intergalactic medium (IGM) neutral fraction
during reionization, we measure a much shallower trend $\propto(1+z)^{-1.44}$.
We compare our measured proximity zone sizes to predictions from hydrodynamical
simulations post-processed with one-dimensional radiative transfer, and find
good agreement between observations and theory irrespective of the ionization
state of the ambient IGM. This insensitivity to IGM ionization state has been
previously noted, and results from the fact that the definition of proximity
zone size as the first drop of the smoothed quasar spectrum below the $10\%$
flux transmission level probes locations where the ionizing radiation from the
quasar is an order of magnitude larger than the expected ultraviolet ionizing
background that sets the neutral fraction of the IGM. Our analysis also
uncovered three objects with exceptionally small proximity zones (two have $R_p
< 1$proper Mpc), which constitute outliers from the observed distribution and
are challenging to explain with our radiative transfer simulations. We consider
various explanations for their origin, such as strong absorption line systems

explain the layer- decoupling effect observed in the compound
La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ at $x=1/8$ (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 127003). In this state
the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, in contrast with
the usual superconducting (SC) state where the order parameter is uniform. In
this work, we study the properties of the amplitude (Higgs) modes in a
unidirectional PDW state. To this end we consider a phenomenological model of
PDW type states coupled to a Fermi surface of fermionic quasiparticles. In
contrast to conventional superconductors that have a single Higgs mode,
unidirectional PDW superconductors have two Higgs modes. While in the PDW state
the Fermi surface largely remains gapless, we find that the damping of the PDW
Higgs modes into fermionic quasiparticles requires exceeding an energy
threshold. We show that this suppression of damping in the PDW state is due to
kinematics. As a result, only one of the two Higgs modes is significantly
damped. In addition, motivated by the experimental phase diagram, we discuss
the mixing of Higgs modes in the coexistence regime of the PDW and uniform SC
states. These results should be observable directly in a Raman spectroscopy, in
momentum resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, and in resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering, thus providing evidence of the PDW states.

photon signals from dark matter annihilation or decay for dark matter particle
masses above $\sim1$ GeV. However, due to the lacking sensitivity of current
experiments at MeV-GeV energies, sometimes dubbed the 'MeV gap', dark matter
models with MeV to sub-GeV particle masses have received little attention so
far. Various proposed MeV missions (like, e.g., e-ASTROGAM or AMEGO) are aimed
at closing this gap in the mid- or long-term future. This, and the absence of
clear dark matter signals in the GeV-TeV range, makes it relevant to carefully
reconsider the expected experimental instrumental sensitivities in this mass
range. The most common two-body annihilation channels for sub-GeV dark matter
are to neutrinos, electrons, pions or directly to photons. Among these, only
the electron channel has been extensively studied, and almost exclusively in
the context of the 511 keV line. In this work, we study the prospects for
detecting MeV dark matter annihilation in general in future MeV missions, using
e-ASTROGAM as reference, and focusing on dark matter masses in the range 1
MeV-3 GeV. In the case of leptonic annihilation, we emphasise the importance of
the often overlooked bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation spectral
features, which in many cases provide the dominant gamma-ray signal in this

dust distribution in this galaxy. We discuss possible implications of this
difference in terms of star formation efficiency and mass build-up at the
galaxy centre. Conversely, we do not detect any CO(5-4) emission from the
UV-bright clumps. This might imply that clumps have a high star formation
efficiency (although they do not display unusually high specific star formation
rates) and are not entirely gas dominated, with gas fractions no larger than
that of their host galaxy (~50%). Stellar feedback and disk instability torques
funnelling gas towards the galaxy centre could contribute to the relatively low
gas content. Alternatively, clumps could fall in a more standard star formation
efficiency regime if their actual star-formation rates are lower than generally
assumed. We find that clump star-formation rates derived with several

hole population is sourced by remnants of stellar evolution. Using the observed
relationship between galaxy mass and stellar metallicity, we predict the black
hole count as a function of galaxy stellar mass. We show, for example, that a
galaxy like the Milky Way should host millions of $\sim 30~M_\odot$ black holes
and dwarf satellite galaxies like Draco should host $\sim 100$ such remnants,
with weak dependence on the assumed IMF and stellar evolution model. Most
low-mass black holes ($\sim10 M_\odot$) typically reside within massive
galaxies ($M_\star \simeq 10^{11} M_\odot$) while massive black holes ($\sim
50~M_\odot$) typically reside within dwarf galaxies ($M_\odot \simeq 10^9
M_\odot$) today. If roughly $1\%$ of black holes are involved in a binary black
hole merger, then the reported merger rate densities from Advanced LIGO can be
accommodated for a range of merger timescales, and the detection of mergers
with $> 50~M_\odot$ black holes should be expected within the next decade.
Identifying the host galaxy population of the mergers provides a way to
constrain both the binary neutron star or black hole formation efficiencies and
the merger timescale distributions; these events would be primarily localized
in dwarf galaxies if the merger timescale is short compared to the age of the
universe and in massive galaxies otherwise. As more mergers are detected, the
prospect of identifying the host galaxy population, either directly through the
detection of electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star mergers or
indirectly through the anisotropy of the events, will become a realistic
possibility.

attractor a corre- sponding classical chaotic attractor can always be found. We
provide with a general way to locate them, rooted in the structure of the
parameter space (which is typically bidimensional, accounting for the forcing
strength and dissipation parameters). In the cases where an approximate point
like quantum distribution is found, it can be associated to exceptionally large
regular structures. Moreover, supposedly anomalous quantum chaotic behaviour
can be very well reproduced by the classical dynamics plus Gaussian noise of
the size of an effective Planck constant $\hbar_{\rm eff}$. We give support to
our conjectures by means of two paradigmatic examples of quantum chaos and
transport theory. In particular, a dissipative driven system becomes
fundamental in order to extend their validity to generic cases.

complex magnetic field structures in the massive dense cores with sizes of 0.1

The major axes of the massive dense cores appear to be aligned either parallel
or perpendicular to the magnetic fields of the filament, indicating that the
parsec-scale magnetic fields play an important role in the formation of the
massive dense cores. However, the correlation between the major axes of the
cores and the magnetic fields of the cores is less significant, suggesting that
during the core formation, the magnetic fields below 0.1 pc scales become less
important than the magnetic fields above 0.1 pc scales in supporting a core
against gravity. Our analysis of the angular dispersion functions of the
observed polarization segments yields the plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths
of 0.4--1.7 mG of the massive dense cores. We estimate the kinematic, magnetic,

parameters show that in the filament, the gravitational energy is dominant over
magnetic and kinematic energies, while in the cores, the kinematic energy is

descendant galaxies through an evolving cumulative number density selection.
This procedure can reproduce the expected evolution of the median stellar mass
from abundance matching. However, models predict an increasing scatter in main
progenitor masses at higher redshifts, which makes galaxy selection at the
median mass unrepresentative. Consequently, there is no guarantee that the
evolution of other galaxy properties deduced from this selection are reliable.
Despite this concern, we show that this procedure approximately reproduces the
evolution of the average stellar density profile of main progenitors of M =
10^11.5 Msun galaxies, when applied to the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. At
z > 3.5 the aperture masses disagree by about a factor two, but this
discrepancy disappears when we include the expected scatter in cumulative
number densities. The evolution of the average density profile in EAGLE broadly
agrees with observations from UltraVISTA and CANDELS, suggesting an inside-out
growth history for these massive galaxies over 0 < z < 5. However, for z < 2
the inside-out growth trend is stronger in EAGLE. We conclude that cumulative
number density matching gives reasonably accurate results when applied to the
evolution of the mean density profile of massive galaxies.

implementation of data-intensive computing systems. This is particularly true
in the design of database management systems (DBMS), which was found to be the
major consumer of energy in the software stack of modern data centers. Among
all database components, the storage system is one of the most power-hungry
elements. In previous work, dynamic power management (DPM) techniques that make
real-time decisions to transition the disks to low-power modes are normally
used to save energy in storage systems. In this paper, we tackle the
limitations of DPM proposals in previous contributions. We introduced a DPM
optimization model integrated with model predictive control (MPC) strategy to
minimize power consumption of the disk-based storage system while satisfying
given performance requirements. It dynamically determines the state of disks
and plans for inter-disk data fragment migration to achieve desirable balance
between power consumption and query response time. Via analyzing our
optimization model to identify structural properties of optimal solutions, we
propose a fast-solution heuristic DPM algorithm that can be integrated in
large-scale disk storage systems for efficient state configuration and data
migration. We evaluate our proposed ideas by running simulations using
extensive set of synthetic workloads based on popular TPC benchmarks. Our
results show that our solution significantly outperforms the best existing
algorithm in both energy savings and response time.

the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko requires conceptual and quantitative
advances in the understanding of surface and outgassing processes. We show here
that vapor flow emitted by the comet around its perihelion spreads laterally in
a surface layer, due to the strong pressure difference between zones
illuminated by sunlight and those in shadow. For such thermal winds to be dense
enough to transport grains -- ten times greater than previous estimates --
outgassing must take place through a surface porous granular layer, and that
layer must be composed of grains whose roughness lowers cohesion consistently
with contact mechanics. The linear stability analysis of the problem, entirely
tested against laboratory experiments, quantitatively predicts the emergence of
bedforms in the observed wavelength range, and their propagation at the scale
of a comet revolution. Although generated by a rarefied atmosphere, they are
paradoxically analogous to ripples emerging on granular beds submitted to
viscous shear flows. This quantitative agreement shows that our understanding
of the coupling between hydrodynamics and sediment transport is able to account
for bedform emergence in extreme conditions and provides a reliable tool to
predict the erosion and accretion processes controlling the evolution of small
solar system bodies.

performing computer simulations of two available versions of oxDNA, a
coarse-grained model of nucleic acids, we investigate the microscopic origin of
twist-bend coupling. We show that this interaction is negligible in the oxDNA
version with symmetric grooves, while it appears in the oxDNA version with
asymmetric grooves. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the covariance
matrix of equilibrium deformations, from which the stiffness parameters are
obtained. The estimated twist-bend coupling coefficient from oxDNA simulations
is $G=30\pm1$~nm. The groove asymmetry induces a novel twist length scale and
an associated renormalized twist stiffness $\kappa_{\rm t} \approx 80$~nm,
which is different from the intrinsic torsional stiffness $C \approx 110$~nm.
This naturally explains the large variations on experimental estimates of the
intrinsic stiffness performed in the past.

study the kinetics of excited carriers in pentacene-MoS2 p-n type-II

that the dissociation of MoS2 excitons occurs by hole transfer to pentacene on
the time scale of 6.7 ps. In addition, the charge-separated state lives for 5.1
ns, up to an order of magnitude longer than the recombination lifetimes from
previously reported 2D material heterojunctions. By studying the fractional
amplitudes of the MoS2 decay processes, the hole transfer yield from MoS2 to
pentacene is found to be approximately 50 percent, with the remaining holes
undergoing trapping due to surface defects. Overall, the ultrafast charge

analyze the simulated subhalos associated with Milky Way-sized dark halos and
find that the values of their surface densities, $\Sigma_{V_{\rm max}}$, are in
good agreement with those for the observed dwarf spheroidal satellites even
without employing any fitting procedures. This implies that this surface
density would not be largely affected by any baryonic feedbacks and thus
universal. Moreover, all subhalos on the small scales of dwarf satellites are
expected to obey the relation $\Sigma_{V_{\rm max}}\propto V_{\rm max}$,
irrespective of differences in their orbital evolutions, host halo properties,
and observed redshifts. Therefore, we find that the universal scaling relation
for dark halos on dwarf galaxy mass scales surely exists and provides us
important clues to understanding fundamental properties of dark halos. We also
investigate orbital and dynamical evolutions of subhalos to understand the
origin of this universal dark halo relation and find that most of subhalos
evolve generally along the $r_{\rm max}\propto V_{\rm max}$ sequence, even

conductivity of charged domain walls (CDWs) in insulating ferroelectrics,
predicted in 1970s6 and detected recently,[7-10] is especially attractive for
applications. This important effect is still in its infancy. The electric
currents are small, the access to the conductivity is hampered by contact
barriers, and stability is low because of sophisticated domain structures
and/or proximity of the Curie point. Here, we report on giant and accessible
persistent CDW conductivity in lithium niobate (LN) crystals (LiNbO3) - a vital
material for photonics. [12] Our results are by far superior to the data known

magnitude owing to CDWs, access to the effect via Ohmic and semi-Ohmic
contacts, and its high stability for temperatures of up to 70 {\deg}C are

simple ferroelectric materials, possessing only two allowed orientations of the
spontaneous polarization, far from the Curie point. Also, CDW functionalities

previous X-ray observations. The mean redshift of the cluster core is found to

the entire cluster and related structures are $1337^{+67}_{-67}$ kms$^{-1}$ and

nodes based on provided labels of a small set of seed nodes. Classic methods
capture the graph structure through some underlying diffusion process that
propagates through the graph edges. Spectral diffusion, which includes
personalized page rank and label propagation, propagates through random walks.
Social diffusion propagates through shortest paths. A common ground to these
diffusions is their {\em linearity}, which does not distinguish between
contributions of few ""strong"" relations and many ""weak"" relations.
  Recently, non-linear methods such as node embeddings and graph convolutional
networks (GCN) demonstrated a large gain in quality for SSL tasks. These
methods introduce multiple components and greatly vary on how the graph
structure, seed label information, and other features are used.
  We aim here to study the contribution of non-linearity, as an isolated
ingredient, to the performance gain. To do so, we place classic linear graph
diffusions in a self-training framework. Surprisingly, we observe that SSL
using the resulting {\em bootstrapped diffusions} not only significantly
improves over the respective non-bootstrapped baselines but also outperform
state-of-the-art non-linear SSL methods. Moreover, since the self-training
wrapper retains the scalability of the base method, we obtain both higher
quality and better scalability.

precipitates, is a commonly utilized technique for strengthening structural
alloys. Structural alloys are commonly strengthened through a high density of
small size intermetallic precipitates. At high temperatures, however, the
precipitates coarsen to reduce the excess energy of the interface, resulting in
a significant reduction in the strengthening provided by the precipitates. In
certain ternary alloys, the secondary solute segregates to the interface and
results in the formation of a high density of nanosize precipitates that
provide enhanced strength and are resistant to coarsening. To understand the
chemical effects involved, and to identify such systems, we develop a
thermodynamic model using the framework of the regular nanocrystalline solution
model. For various global compositions, temperatures and thermodynamic
parameters, equilibrium configuration of Mg-Sn-Zn alloy is evaluated by
minimizing the Gibbs free energy function with respect to the region-specific
(bulk solid-solution, interface and precipitate) concentrations and sizes. The
results show that Mg$_2$Sn precipitates can be stabilized to nanoscale sizes
through Zn segregation to Mg/Mg$_2$Sn interface, and the precipitates can be
stabilized against coarsening at high-temperatures by providing a larger Zn
concentration in the system. Together with the inclusion of elastic strain
energy effects and the input of computationally informed interface
thermodynamic parameters in the future, the model is expected to provide a more

subgraph counting, we show how edge sampling weights can be chosen so as to
minimize the estimation variance of counts of specified sets of subgraphs. In
distinction with many prior graph sampling schemes, GPS separates the functions
of edge sampling and subgraph estimation. We propose two estimation frameworks:
(1) Post-Stream estimation, to allow GPS to construct a reference sample of
edges to support retrospective graph queries, and (2) In-Stream estimation, to
allow GPS to obtain lower variance estimates by incrementally updating the
subgraph count estimates during stream processing. Unbiasedness of subgraph
estimators is established through a new Martingale formulation of graph stream
order sampling, which shows that subgraph estimators, written as a product of
constituent edge estimators are unbiased, even when computed at different
points in the stream. The separation of estimation and sampling enables
significant resource savings relative to previous work. We illustrate our
framework with applications to triangle and wedge counting. We perform a
large-scale experimental study on real-world graphs from various domains and

wedge counting, while storing a small fraction of the graph with average update

astronomy is the Einstein cross, which is an astronomical phenomenon in which a
single quasar is observed as four distinct sky objects (due to gravitational
lensing) when captured by earth telescopes. Finding such crosses, as well as
other geometric patterns, is a challenging problem as the potential number of
sets of elements that compose shapes is exponentially large in the size of the

constellation queries and propose algorithms to find them in large data

unindexed join processing to discover sets of points that match a geometric
pattern within some additive factor on the pairwise distances. Our distributed
experiments show that the choice of composition algorithm (matrix

Finally, solving the problem for relative distances requires a novel

dominance, and (ii) an upper bound on error-CDFs. We prove that an algorithm
that optimizes any distance based cost function is not stochastically dominated
by any other algorithm. This suggests that in lieu of the search for a
universally best localization algorithm, the community should focus on finding
the best algorithm for a given well-defined objective.

tackle this challenge, we introduce CMU DeepLens, a new fully automated

machine learning approach does not require any tuning after the training step
which only requires realistic image simulations of strongly lensed systems. We
train and validate our model on a set of 20,000 LSST-like mock observations

non-lenses of 99%, a completeness of 90% can be achieved for lenses with
Einstein radii larger than 1.4"" and S/N larger than 20 on individual $g$-band
LSST exposures. Finally, we emphasize the importance of realistically complex

the performance of models of significantly different complexities cannot be

single-shot fidelity and limiting mechanisms for two variations of an enhanced
latching readout. We achieve average single-shot readout fidelities > 99.3% and
> 99.86% for the conventional and enhanced readout respectively, the latter
being the highest to date for spin blockade. The signal amplitude is enhanced
to a full one-electron signal while preserving the readout speed. Furthermore,
layout constraints are relaxed because the charge sensor signal is no longer
dependent on being aligned with the conventional (2, 0) - (1, 1) charge dipole.
Silicon donor-quantum-dot qubits are used for this study, for which the dipole
insensitivity substantially relaxes donor placement requirements. One of the
readout variations also benefits from a parametric lifetime enhancement by
replacing the spin-relaxation process with a charge-metastable one. This
provides opportunities to further increase the fidelity. The relaxation
mechanisms in the different regimes are investigated. This work demonstrates a
readout that is fast, has one-electron signal and results in higher fidelity.
It further predicts that going beyond 99.9% fidelity in a few microseconds of
measurement time is within reach.

feature among intermediate-age clusters (1--3 Gyr) in the Magellanic Clouds.
Multiple-generation star formation and stellar rotation or interacting binaries
have been proposed to explain the feature. However, it remains controversial in
the field of stellar populations. Here we present the main results of an
ongoing star formation among older star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
Cross-matching the positions of star clusters and young stellar objects has
yielded 15 matches with 7 located in the cluster center. We demonstrate that
this is not by chance by estimating local number densities of young stellar
objects for each star cluster. This method is not based on isochrone fitting,
which leads to some uncertainties in age estimation and methods of background
subtraction. We also find no direct correlation between atomic hydrogen and the
clusters. This suggests that gas accretion for fueling the star formation must
be happening in situ. These findings support for the multiple-generations
scenario as a plausible explanation for the extended main-sequence turn-off.

large number of graph models. In general, prevalent methods for structural data
recognition have two shortcomings: 1) Only a single model is used to capture
structural variation. 2) Naive recognition methods are used, such as the
nearest neighbor method. In this paper, we propose strengthening the
recognition performance of these models as well as their ability to capture
structural variation. The proposed method constructs a large number of graph
models and trains decision trees using the models. This paper makes two main
contributions. The first is a novel graph model that can quickly perform
calculations, which allows us to construct several models in a feasible amount
of time. The second contribution is a novel approach to structural data
recognition: graph model boosting. Comprehensive structural variations can be
captured with a large number of graph models constructed in a boosting
framework, and a sophisticated classifier can be formed by aggregating the
decision trees. Consequently, we can carry out structural data recognition with
powerful recognition capability in the face of comprehensive structural
variation. The experiments shows that the proposed method achieves impressive
results and outperforms existing methods on datasets of IAM graph database

mother to daughter cells during cell differentiation. When de novo chromatin
modifications (establishment or erasure of, respectively, new or pre-existing
DNA methylations and/or histone modifications) are made in a daughter cell,
however, it has a different epigenome than its mother cell. Although de novo
chromatin modifications are an important event that comprises elementary
processes of cell differentiation, its molecular mechanism remains poorly
understood. We argue in this Letter that a key to solving this problem lies in
understanding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)- a type of RNA that is
becoming increasingly prominent in epigenetic studies. Many studies show that
lncRNAs form ribonucleo-protein complexes in the nucleus and are involved in
chromatin modifications. However, chromatin-modifying enzymes lack the
information about genomic positions on which they act. It is known, on the
other hand, that a single-stranded RNA in general can bind to a double-stranded
DNA to form a triple helix. If each lncRNA forms a ribonucleo-protein complex
with chromatin-modifying enzymes on one hand and, at the same time, a triple
helix with a genomic region based on its specific nucleotide sequence on the
other hand, it can induce de novo chromatin modifications at specific sites.
Thus, the great variety of lncRNAs can be explained by the requirement for the
diversity of ""genomic address codes"" specific to their cognate genomic regions
where de novo chromatin modifications take place.

on ""intrinsic properties"" of the group such as the purpose of the pedestrians,
their personal relation, their gender, age, and body size. In this work we
quantitatively study the dynamical properties of pedestrian dyads by analysing
a large data set of automatically tracked pedestrian trajectories in an
unconstrained ""ecological"" setting (a shopping mall), whose relational group
properties have been coded by three different human observers. We observed that
females walk slower and closer than males, that workers walk faster, at a
larger distance and more abreast than leisure oriented people, and that inter
group relation has a strong effect on group structure, with couples walking
very close and abreast, colleagues walking at a larger distance, and friends
walking more abreast than family members. Pedestrian height (obtained
automatically through our tracking system) influences velocity and abreast
distance, both growing functions of the average group height. Results regarding
pedestrian age show as expected that elderly people walk slowly, while active
age adults walk at the maximum velocity. Groups with children have a strong
tendency to walk in a non abreast formation, with a large distance (despite a
low abreast distance). A cross-analysis of the interplay between these
intrinsic features, taking in account also the effect of extrinsic crowd
density, confirms these major effects but reveals also a richer structure. An
interesting and unexpected result, for example, is that the velocity of groups
with children {\it increases} with density, at least in the low-medium density
range found under normal conditions in shopping malls. Children also appear to
behave differently according to the gender of the parent.

a meson or a baryon depending on the distance to its coalescence partner(s). We

population is $\alpha=-0.52$, which is typical of most SNRs. However, our
estimates show a clear flattening of the synchrotron $\alpha$ as the remnants
age. As predicted, our CC SNRs sample are significantly brighter radio emitters

correlation tests in the presence of non-linearity, and takes $O(pn)$ time for

absorption troughs can be divided into two components of blueshift velocities
of $\sim$700 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$1400 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the quasar
rest-frame. The former component shows rare Balmer absorption, which is an
indicator of high density absorbing gas, thus the quasar is worth follow-up
spectroscopic observations. Our follow-up optical and near-infrared spectra
using MMT, YFOSC, TripleSpec and DBSP reveal that the strengths of the
absorption lines vary for both of the two components, while the velocities do
not change. We reproduce all of the spectral data by assuming that only the
ionization state of the absorbing gas is variable and that all other physical
properties are invariable. The variation of ionization is consistent with the
variation of optical continuum from the V-band light-curve. Additionally, we
can not interpret the data by assuming that the variability is due to a
movement of the absorbing gas. Therefore, our analysis strongly indicates that
the absorption line variability in LBQS 1206+1052 is photoionization-driven. As
shown from photo-ionization simulations, the absorbing gas with blueshift
velocity of $\sim$700 km s$^{-1}$ has a density in the range of $10^9$ to

be used to establish a static or dynamic root of trust in embedded and
cyber-physical systems. It can also be used as a building block for other
security services and primitives, such as software updates and patches,
verifiable deletion and memory resetting. There are three major classes of RA
designs: hardware-based, software-based, and hybrid, each with its own set of
benefits and drawbacks. This paper presents the first hybrid RA design, called
HYDRA, that builds upon formally verified software components that ensure
memory isolation and protection, as well as enforce access control to memory
and other resources. HYDRA obtains these properties by using the formally
verified seL4 microkernel. (Until now, this was only attainable with purely
hardware-based designs.) Using seL4 requires fewer hardware modifications to
the underlying microprocessor. Building upon a formally verified software
component increases confidence in security of the overall design of HYDRA and
its implementation. We instantiate HYDRA on two commodity hardware platforms
and assess the performance and overhead of performing RA on such platforms via
experimentation; we show that HYDRA can attest 10MB of memory in less than
500msec when using a Speck-based message authentication code (MAC) to compute a
cryptographic checksum over the memory to be attested.

aggregation algorithm, Priority-Based Aggregation (PBA). While order sampling
is a powerful and e cient method for weighted sampling from a stream of
uniquely keyed items, there is no current algorithm that realizes the benefits
of order sampling in the context of stream aggregation over non-unique keys. A
naive approach to order sample regardless of key then aggregate the results is
hopelessly inefficient. In distinction, our proposed algorithm uses a single
persistent random variable across the lifetime of each key in the cache, and
maintains unbiased estimates of the key aggregates that can be queried at any

approach represents a considerable reduction in computational complexity

We present Scylla, a scheme that deploys a new technique for in-place code
encryption to hide the code layout of a randomized binary, and restricts the
control flow to a benign execution path. This allows us to i) implicitly
restrict control-flow targets to basic block entries without requiring the

legitimate basic blocks, and iii) hide the underlying code layout under
malicious read access to the program. Our analysis demonstrates that Scylla is

With the help of careful symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations,
we can make a systematic assignment for the observed Raman modes in both
phases. The significant changes in line-width and the continuous evolution of
Raman frequencies with temperatures were observed for the E$_g$ modes around
the transition temperature, which suggests that the ferroelectric-like
structural transition is a continuous order-disorder transition. The result
sheds light on the coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity in the

have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL).
However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap
between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches
fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data
scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g.,
due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control
methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test
scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper
proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we
train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that
applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is
reinforced -- that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We
formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function.
Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah,
Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a)
improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test
conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the
adversary.

learns multiple searching policies through maximizing the long-term reward that

Allowing multiple near-optimal policies, Tree-RL offers more diversity in
search paths and is able to find multiple objects with a single feed-forward

chromospheric activity. However, phase-resolved spectroscopy is needed to
verify this assumption. We briefly consider other chromospherically active

in-memory system. However, distributed transactions complicate the dependency
resolution, and therefore, an effective transaction partitioning strategy is
essential to reduce expensive multi-node distributed transactions. During
failure recovery, log must be examined from the last checkpoint onwards and the
affected transactions are re-executed based on the way they are partitioned and
executed. Existing approaches treat both transaction management and recovery as
two separate problems, even though recovery is dependent on the sequence in
which transactions are executed.
  In this paper, we propose to treat the transaction management and recovery
problems as one. We first propose an efficient Distributed Dependency Graph
based Concurrency Control (DistDGCC) protocol for handling transactions
spanning multiple nodes, and propose a new novel and efficient logging protocol
called Dependency Logging that also makes use of dependency graphs for
efficient logging and recovery. DistDGCC optimizes the average cost for each
distributed transaction by processing transactions in batch. Moreover, it also
reduces the effects of thread blocking caused by distributed transactions and
consequently improves the runtime performance. Further, dependency logging
exploits the same data structure that is used by DistDGCC to reduce the logging
overhead, as well as the logical dependency information to improve the recovery
parallelism. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of
our proposed technique against state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental
results show that DistDGCC is efficient and scalable, and dependency logging
supports fast recovery with marginal runtime overhead. Hence, the overall
system performance is significantly improved as a result.

  Two algorithms that are faster approximations to the greedy forward selection
were introduced recently ([Mirzasoleiman et al. 2013, 2015]). They achieve
better performance by exploiting distributed computation and stochastic
evaluation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance guarantees
for submodular functions.
  In this paper we show that divergent from previously held opinion,
submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees for these two
algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak
submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our
result extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of
functions. Furthermore, we show that a bounded submodularity ratio can be used
to provide data dependent bounds that can sometimes be tighter also for
submodular functions. We empirically validate our work by showing superior
performance of fast greedy approximations versus several established baselines
on artificial and real datasets.

inherits the difficulties and complexities from both components and makes it a
challenging problem, which calls for new methodology. We propose a novel
profile B-spline method to estimate the parameters by approximating the unknown
nonparametric link function in the single-index component part with B-spline,
while the linear slope function in the functional component part is estimated
by the functional principal component basis. The consistency and asymptotic
normality of the parametric estimators are derived, and the global convergence
of the proposed estimator of the linear slope function is also established.
More excitingly, the latter convergence is optimal in the minimax sense. A
two-stage procedure is implemented to estimate the nonparametric link function,
and the resulting estimator possesses the optimal global rate of convergence.
Furthermore, the convergence rate of the mean squared prediction error for a
predictor is also obtained. Empirical properties of the proposed procedures are
studied through Monte Carlo simulations. A real data example is also analyzed

lower the transmit powers of SUs, we employ multi-hop transmission with time
division multiple access, by which SUs first harvest energy from the RF signals
of PUs and then transmit data in the allocated time concurrently with PUs, all
in the licensed spectrum. In this way, the available transmit energy of each SU
mainly depends on the harvested energy before the turn to transmit, namely
energy causality. Meanwhile, the transmit powers of SUs must be strictly
controlled to protect PUs from harmful interference. Thus, subject to the

clouds. In contrast to the uncertainty of the spectral line observation itself,
the uncertainty of the analysis method to derive the magnetic field strength
from these observations is not been well characterized so far.
  Aims. We investigate the impact of several physical quantities on the
uncertainty of the analysis method, which is used to derive the line-of-sight
(LOS) magnetic field strength from Zeeman split spectral lines.
  Methods. We simulate the Zeeman splitting of the 1665 MHz OH line with the 3D
radiative transfer (RT) extension ZRAD. This extension is based on the line RT
code Mol3D (Ober et al. 2015) and has been developed for the POLArized
RadIation Simulator POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016).
  Results. Observations of the OH Zeeman effect in typical molecular clouds are
not significantly affected by the uncertainty of the analysis method. We
derived an approximation to quantify the range of parameters in which the
analysis method works sufficiently accurate and provide factors to convert our
results to other spectral lines and species as well. We applied these
conversion factors to CN and found that observations of the CN Zeeman effect in
typical molecular clouds are neither significantly affected by the uncertainty
of the analysis method. In addition, we found that the density has almost no
impact on the uncertainty of the analysis method, unless it reaches values
higher than those typically found in molecular clouds. Furthermore, the
uncertainty of the analysis method increases, if both the gas velocity and the
magnetic field show significant variations along the line-of-sight. However,
this increase should be small in Zeeman observations of most molecular clouds
considering typical velocities of ~1 km/s.

Hall junction are analyzed. We investigate the evolution of the electric and
thermal two-terminal conductances, $G$ and $G^Q$, with system size $L$ and
temperature $T$. This is done both for the case of strong interaction between
the 1 and 1/ 3 modes (when the low-temperature physics of the interacting
segment of the device is controlled by the vicinity of the strong-disorder
Kane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point) and for relatively weak interaction, for
which the disorder is irrelevant at $T=0$ in the renormalization-group sense.
The transport properties in both cases are similar in several respects. In
particular, $G(L)$ is close to 4/3 (in units of $e^2/h$) and $G^Q$ to 2 (in
units of $\pi T / 6 \hbar$) for small $L$, independently of the interaction
strength. For large $L$ the system is in an incoherent regime, with $G$ given
by 2/3 and $G^Q$ showing the Ohmic scaling, $G^Q\propto 1/L$, again for any
interaction strength. The hallmark of the strong-disorder fixed point is the
emergence of an intermediate range of $L$, in which the electric conductance
shows strong mesoscopic fluctuations and the thermal conductance is $G^Q=1$.
The analysis is extended also to a device with floating 1/3 mode, as studied in
a recent experiment [A. Grivnin et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 266803 (2014)].

Majorana neutrinos and there are experimental observations pointing toward the
existence of sterile neutrinos in addition to the three weakly interacting

  Bolometers and calorimeters are low temperature detectors used in many

has been great technical progress on low temperature detectors since they were
proposed for neutrino physics experiments in 1984. This general detector

subsystems of a bipartite system, the dynamics of the entanglement in the

Here we study the dynamics of a two-level system interacting with an

two-level quantum systems. Our model can be seen as a close approximation to
the `spin bath' model at low temperatures. We analyze the Markovian nature of
the dynamics, as we change the coupling between the system and the environment.
We find the Kraus operators of the dynamics for certain classes of couplings.
We show that any form of time-independent or time-polynomial coupling gives

parameter values of time-exponential coupling. Moreover, we study the

states of vortices form after a transition period. We calculate the
incompressible part of the kinetic-energy spectrum of the BEC. In the
transition period, a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum appears in the infrared
regime with the wave number $k$, $k<\zeta^{-1}$, where $\zeta$ is the healing

as $k^{-3}$. On the other hand in the steady states, another scaling low
appears. We find a relationship between the above mentioned kinetic-energy

of a few created vortices develops the Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum.

the mathematical representation of the mechanism of transmission of the

Two specific examples are discussed, which have been the subject of intensive

mathematical methods, and has even posed new non trivial mathematical problems,
as one can realize from the list of references. One of the most relevant
problems posed by the authors, i.e. regional control, has been emphasized here:
the public health concern consists of eradicating the disease in the relevant
population, as fast as possible. On the other hand, very often the entire
domain of interest for the epidemic, is either unknown, or difficult to manage
for an affordable implementation of suitable environmental programmes. For
regional control instead it might be sufficient to implement such programmes
only in a given subregion conveniently chosen so to lead to an effective
(exponentially fast) eradication of the epidemic in the whole habitat; it is
evident that this practice may have an enormous importance in real cases with

investigate if chromium can form stable bound configurations with vacancies in

The binding energy of a cluster containing a single vacancy and from one to
eight Cr atoms can be well described by a linear function of the number of
chromium atoms in the second, third and fifth nearest neighbour coordination.
The magnetic origin of the binding energy trend is confirmed by a correlation
between the average value of the magnetic moment of a Cr atom and the binding
energy. Similar trends are also found for di-vacancy-Cr clusters, confirming
that they likely also characterise larger systems not yet accessible to ab

increased more than twice in the di-vacancy case in comparison with a single

supremacy over classical correlations has been demonstrated in numerous

entanglement in Bayesian game theory, particularly in social welfare solution
(SWS), a strategy which the players follow to maximize the sum of their
payoffs. Given a multi-partite quantum state as an advice, players can come up
with several correlated strategies by performing local measurements on their
parts of the quantum state. A quantum strategy is called quantum-SWS if it is
advantageous over a classical equilibrium (CE) strategy in the sense that none
of the players has to sacrifice their CE-payoff rather some have incentive and
at the same time it maximizes the sum of all players' payoffs over all possible
quantum advantageous strategies. Quantum state yielding such a quantum-SWS is
called a quantum social welfare advice (SWA). We show that any two-qubit pure
entangled state, even if it is arbitrarily close to a product state, can serve
as quantum-SWA in some Bayesian game. Our result, thus, gives cognizance to the
fact that every two-qubit pure entanglement is the best resource for some
operational task.

magnetic rather than the conventional electron-phonon origin. Interest in such
exotic pairing was initiated by the 1979 discovery of heavy-fermion
superconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, which exhibits strong antiferromagnetic
fluctuations. A hallmark of unconventional pairing by anisotropic repulsive
interactions is that the superconducting energy gap changes sign as a function
of the electron momentum, often leading to nodes where the gap goes to zero.
Here, we report low-temperature specific heat, thermal conductivity and
magnetic penetration depth measurements in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, demonstrating the
absence of gap nodes at any point on the Fermi surface. Moreover,
electron-irradiation experiments reveal that the superconductivity survives
even when the electron mean free path becomes substantially shorter than the
superconducting coherence length. This indicates that superconductivity is
robust against impurities, implying that there is no sign change in the gap
function. These results show that, contrary to long-standing belief, heavy
electrons with extremely strong Coulomb repulsions can condense into a
fully-gapped s-wave superconducting state, which has an on-site attractive
pairing interaction.

task onto the automata, and a recurrent architecture for handling the

behavior of the solutions as $t\to +\infty$. We then deduce results on the long
time behavior of the associated branching process, with state space the set of
all finite configurations of $\mathbf{R}^d$, under the assumption that
$\sum_{k\geq 1} k^2q_k<\infty$. It turns out that the distribution of the
branching process behaves when the time tends to infinity like that of the
Brownian motion on the set of all finite configurations of $\mathbf{R}^d$.
However, due to the lack of conservation of the total mass of the initial non
linear equation, a deformation with a multiplicative coefficient occurs.
Finally, we establish asymptotic properties of the occupation time of this
branching process.

One
proposed model for the transport and release of mechanical energy generated in
the sub-phorospheric layers and photosphere is the nanoflare model that
incorporates Ohmic heating which releases a part of the energy stored in the
magnetic field via magnetic reconnection. The problem with the verification of
this model is that we cannot resolve observationally small scale events.
Histograms of observable characteristics of flares, show powerlaw behavior, for
both energy release rate, size and total energy. Depending on the powerlaw
index of the energy release, nanoflares might be an important candidate for
coronal heating; we seek to find that index. In this paper, we employ a
numerical 3D-MHD simulation produced by the numerical code Bifrost, and a new
technique to identify the 3D heating events at a specific instant. The quantity
we explore is the Joule heating, which is explicitly correlated with the
magnetic reconnection because depends on the curl of the magnetic field. We are
able to identify 4136 events in a volume $24 \times 24 \times 9.5 \
\textrm{Mm}^3$ (i.e. $768 \times 786 \times 331$ grid cells) of a specific
snapshot. We find a powerlaw slope of the released energy per second, and two
powerlaw slopes of the identified volume. The identified energy events do not
represent all the released energy, but of the identified events, the total
energy of the largest events dominate the energy release. Most of the energy
release happens in the lower corona, while heating drops with height. We find
that with a specific identification method that large events can be resolved
into smaller ones, but at the expense of the total identified energy releases.
The energy release which cannot be identified as an event favours a low energy
release mechanism.

the susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signal in white matter
(WM), with application to demyelination.
  Methods: Previous work has modeled susceptibility-weighted signals under the
assumption that axons are cylindrical. In this work, we explore the
implications of this assumption by considering the effect of more realistic
geometries. A three-compartment WM model incorporating relevant properties
based on literature was used to predict the MR signal. Myelinated axons were
modeled with several cross-sectional geometries of increasing realism: nested
circles, warped/elliptical circles and measured axonal geometries from electron
micrographs. Signal simulations from the different microstructural geometries
were compared to measured signals from a Cuprizone mouse model with varying
degrees of demyelination.
  Results: Results from simulation suggest that axonal geometry affects the MR
signal. Predictions with realistic models were significantly different compared
to circular models under the same microstructural tissue properties, for
simulations with and without diffusion.
  Conclusion: The geometry of axons affects the MR signal significantly.
Literature estimates of myelin susceptibility, which are based on fitting
biophysical models to the MR signal, are likely to be biased by the assumed
geometry, as will any derived microstructural properties.

build correlation functions $C(\theta; z_1, z_2)$ on and between shells which

the faster the change. This apparently self-evident proposition, however, is
derived under the assumption that genetic variation within a population is
primarily supplied by mutation (i.e.\ mutation-driven evolution). Here, we show
that this proposition does not actually hold for recombination-driven
evolution, i.e.\ evolution in which genetic variation is primarily created by
recombination rather than mutation. By numerically investigating population
genetics models of recombination, migration and selection, we demonstrate that
stronger selection can slow down evolution on a perfectly smooth fitness
landscape. Through simple analytical calculation, this apparently
counter-intuitive result is shown to stem from two opposing effects of natural
selection on the rate of evolution. On the one hand, natural selection tends to
increase the rate of evolution by increasing the fixation probability of fitter
genotypes. On the other hand, natural selection tends to decrease the rate of
evolution by decreasing the chance of recombination between immigrants and
resident individuals. As a consequence of these opposing effects, there is a
finite selection pressure maximizing the rate of evolution. Hence, stronger
selection can imply slower evolution if genetic variation is primarily supplied
by recombination.

translate the matching problem into a generalized constraint satisfaction

filtering techniques based on local consistency checking. Such filtering
techniques can a priori refute a large percentage of generalized constraint

adaptation can be combined with every matching algorithm. The techniques

that biaxial strain, both tensile and compressive, can be applied and released

dichalcogenides monolayers deposited on polymeric substrates. We can control
the amount of biaxial strain applied by letting the substrate expand or
compress. To do this we change the substrate temperature and choose materials
with a large thermal expansion coefficient. After the investigation of the
substrate-dependent strain transfer, we performed micro-differential
spectroscopy of four transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers (MoS2, MoSe2,
WS2, WSe2) under the application of biaxial strain and measured their optical
properties. For tensile strain we observe a redshift of the bandgap that
reaches a value as large as 95 meV/% in the case of single-layer WS2 deposited

extension/compression follow the order MoSe2 < MoS2 < WSe2 < WS2. Theoretical

potential energies between atoms and molecules with mutual distances ranging
from a few tens to a few hundreds Bohr radii. The involved energies are much
smaller than the usual chemical bond energies. However, they are comparable
with the typical kinetic energies of particles in an ultracold gas ($T\ll 1K$),
so that the long-range interactions play a central role in its dynamics. The
progress of research devoted to ultracold gases shed a new light on the
well-established topic of long-range interactions, because: (i) the interacting
atoms and molecules can be prepared in a well-defined quantum (electronic,
vibrational, rotational, fine or hyper-fine), ground or excited level; and (ii)
long-range interactions can be tailored at will using external electromagnetic
fields.
  In this chapter, we present the essential concepts and mathematical relations
to calculate long-range potential energies. We start with deriving the
multipolar expansion of the electrostatic interaction energy between classical
charge distributions, both in Cartesian coordinates for pedagogical purpose,
and in spherical coordinates for practical use. Then we combine multipolar
expansion and quantum perturbation theory, to obtain the general first- and
second-order energy corrections, including the well-known van der Waals energy.
We consider two central examples in the current context of ultracold gases: (i)
a pair of alkali-metal atoms and (ii) a pair of alkali-metal heteronuclear
diatomic molecules submitted to an electric field. We highlight the key role of
the total angular momenta of the interacting particles and of the complex,

well understood. In particular, it is not clear which mechanisms operate, in
addition to fast rotation, to produce the observed variable ejection of matter.
The star Achernar is a privileged laboratory to probe these additional
mechanisms because it is close, presents B-Be phase variations on timescales
ranging from 6 yr to 15 yr, a companion star was discovered around it, and
probably presents a polar wind or jet. Aims. Despite all these previous
studies, the disk around Achernar was never directly imaged. Therefore we seek
to produce an image of the photosphere and close environment of the star.
Methods. We used infrared long-baseline interferometry with the PIONIER/VLTI
instrument to produce reconstructed images of the photosphere and close
environment of the star over four years of observations. To study the disk
formation, we compared the observations and reconstructed images to previously
computed models of both the stellar photosphere alone (normal B phase) and the
star presenting a circumstellar disk (Be phase). Results. The observations
taken in 2011 and 2012, during the quiescent phase of Achernar, do not exhibit
a disk at the detection limit of the instrument. In 2014, on the other hand, a
disk was already formed and our reconstructed image reveals an extended H-band
continuum excess flux. Our results from interferometric imaging are also
supported by several H-alpha line profiles showing that Achernar started an
emission-line phase sometime in the beginning of 2013. The analysis of our
reconstructed images shows that the 2014 near-IR flux extends to 1.7 - 2.3
equatorial radii. Our model-independent size estimation of the H-band continuum
contribution is compatible with the presence of a circumstellar disk, which is
in good agreement with predictions from Be-disk models.

The maximal jet model was used to derive a 1-D hydrodynamical model of jets in

mistakes made in the derivation of the 1-D Euler equation and relax the maximal

the jet has a small opening angle and a small terminal Lorentz factor. We find
that the major conclusion from the maximal jet model, the jet-disk symbiosis,
can be generally applied to astrophysical jets. We also show that isothermal

attraction of vortices to the edges of the junction. The work focuses on the
dynamics of vortices in Josephson junctions in thin films where the effects of
Josephson nonlocality dominate but London screening is negligible. We obtained
an exact solution for a vortex driven by an arbitrary time-dependent current in
an overdamped junction where the vortex turns into a phase slip if the length
of the junction is shorter than a critical length which depends on current. Our
analytical and numerical results show that the dynamic behavior of vortices
depends crucially on the ohmic damping parameter. In overdamped junctions
vortices expand as they move faster and turn into phase slips as current
increases. In underdamped junctions vortices entering from the edges produce
Cherenkov radiation generating cascades of expanding vortex-antivortex pairs,
which ultimately drive the entire junction into a resistive phase slip state.
Simulations revealed a variety of complex dynamic states of vortices under dc
and ac currents which can manifest themselves in hysteretic current-voltage
characteristics with jumps and regions with negative differential resistance
resulting from transitions from oscillating to ballistic propagation of
vortices, their interaction with pinning centers and standing nonlinear waves

agents acting independently from each other. This note shows how this
assumption is crucial in the definition of Rational Choice Theory. It explains
how a consistent Alternate Rational Choice Theory, as suggested by Jean-Pierre
Dupuy, can be built on the exact opposite assumption, and how it provides a
viable account for alternate, actually observed behavior of rational agents
that is based on correlations between their decisions.
  The end goal of this note is three-fold: (i) to motivate that the Perfect
Prediction Equilibrium, implementing Dupuy's notion of projected time and
previously called ""projected equilibrium"", is a reasonable approach in certain
real situations and a meaningful complement to the Nash paradigm, (ii) to
summarize common misconceptions about this equilibrium, and (iii) to give a

frequency by steering Area Control Errors (ACEs) to zero. Existing methods are
a form of integral control with the characteristic that large control gain
coefficients introduce an overshoot and small ones result in a slow convergence
to a steady state. In order to deal with the large frequency deviation problem,
which is the main concern of the power system integrated with a large number of
renewable energy, a faster convergence is critical. In this paper, we propose a
secondary frequency control method named Power-Imbalance Allocation Control
(PIAC) to restore the nominal frequency with a minimized control cost,in which
a coordinator estimates the power imbalance and dispatches the control inputs
to the controllers after solving an economic power dispatch problem. The power
imbalance estimation converges exponentially in PIAC, both overshoots and large
frequency deviations are avoided. In addition, when PIAC is implemented in a
multi-area controlled network, the controllers of an area are independent of
the disturbance of the neighbor areas, which allows an asynchronous control in
the multi-area network. A Lyapunov stability analysis shows that PIAC is
locally asymptotically stable and simulation results illustrates that it
effectively eliminates the drawback of the traditional integral control based
methods.

rotate through random hardware addresses in order to prevent observers from
singling out their traffic or physical location from other nearby devices.
Adoption of this technology, however, has been sporadic and varied across
device manufacturers. In this paper, we present the first wide-scale study of
MAC address randomization in the wild, including a detailed breakdown of
different randomization techniques by operating system, manufacturer, and model
of device.
  We then identify multiple flaws in these implementations which can be
exploited to defeat randomization as performed by existing devices. First, we
show that devices commonly make improper use of randomization by sending
wireless frames with the true, global address when they should be using a
randomized address. We move on to extend the passive identification techniques
of Vanhoef et al. to effectively defeat randomization in ~96% of Android
phones. Finally, we show a method that can be used to track 100% of devices
using randomization, regardless of manufacturer, by exploiting a previously
unknown flaw in the way existing wireless chipsets handle low-level control
frames.

consider the case of a perfect mirror, which is free to move around an

quantum mechanically. We investigate how the quantum fluctuations of the
mirror's position affect vacuum field fluctuations for both a one-dimensional
scalar and electromagnetic field, showing that the effect is particularly
significant in the proximity of the moving mirror. This result can be also
relevant for possible gravitational effects, since the field energy density
couples to gravity. We stress that this interaction-induced modification of the
vacuum field fluctuations can be probed through the Casimir-Polder interaction
with a polarizable body, thus allowing to detect the effect of the mirror's
quantum position fluctuations. We then consider the effect of an environment
such as an isotropic photonic crystal or a metallic waveguide, on the resonance
interaction between two entangled identical atoms, one excited and the other in
the ground state. We discuss the strong dependence of the resonance interaction
with the relative position of the atomic transition frequency with the gap of
the photonic crystal in the former case, and with the cut-off frequency of
waveguide in the latter.

to date, based on the extreme adaptive optics of the SPHERE focal instrument
implemented on the ESO/VLT and operated in its IRDIS imaging mode. Stacking-up
a few hundreds of short exposures in J and Ks spectral bands over a FoV of
10.9""x12.3"" centered on the R136a1 stellar component, enabled us to carry a
refined photometric analysis of the core of R136. We detected 1110 and 1059
sources in J and Ks images respectively with 818 common sources. Thanks to
better angular resolution and dynamic range, we found that more than 62.6%
(16.5%) of the stars, detected both in J and Ks data, have neighbours closer
than 0.2"" (0.1""). Among resolved and detected sources R136a1 and R136c have
visual companions and R136a3 is resolved as two stars separated by 59mas. The
new set of detected sources were used to re-assess the age and extinction of
R136 based on 54 spectroscopically stars that have been recently studied with
HST slit-spectroscopy. Over 90% of these 54 sources identified visual
companions (closer than 0.2""). We found the most probable age and extinction
for these sources within the photometric and spectroscopic error-bars.
Additionally, using PARSEC evolutionary isochrones and tracks, we estimated the
stellar mass range for each detected source (common in J and K data) and
plotted the generalized histogram of mass (MF with error-bars). Using SPHERE
data, we have gone one step further and partially resolved and studied the IMF
covering mass range of (3-300) Msun at the age of 1 and 1.5 Myr. The density in
the core of R136 is estimated and extrapolated in 3D and larger radii (up to
6pc). We show that the stars in the core are still unresolved due to crowding,
and the results we obtained are upper limits. Higher angular resolution is
mandatory to overcome these difficulties.

generation in microresonators can be modelled in the frequency domain using
coupled mode equations, and has also recently been successfully described in
the time domain using a nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation known as the
Lugiato-Lefever equation. Though time-domain approaches have brought many
interesting insights for the understanding of microcombs, an intuitive

frequency-domain model of microcombs that describes the overall structure of
the spectra in terms of a few collective excitations of groups of neighboring
comb lines, which we term ""superoscillators"". This approach ties in nicely with
the recently-developed time-domain model based on soliton crystals, and links
the microcomb generation process with frequency response theory.

atoms in vacuum, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. We first
investigate the van der Waals/Casimir-Polder dispersion and resonance
interactions between two uniformly accelerated atoms in vacuum. We show that
the atomic acceleration significantly affects the van der Waals force, yielding
a different scaling of the interaction with the interatomic distance and an
explicit time dependence of the interaction energy. We argue how these results
could allow for an indirect detection of the Unruh effect through dispersion
interactions between atoms. We then consider the resonance interaction between
two accelerated atoms, prepared in a correlated Bell-type state, and
interacting with the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state, separating
vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction contributions, both in the
free-space and in the presence of a perfectly reflecting plate. We show that
nonthermal effects of acceleration manifest in the resonance interaction,
yielding a change of the distance dependence of the resonance interaction
energy. This suggests that the equivalence between temperature and acceleration
does not apply to all radiative properties of accelerated atoms. To further
explore this aspect, we evaluate the resonance interaction between two atoms in
non inertial motion in the coaccelerated (Rindler) frame and show that in this
case the assumption of an Unruh temperature for the field is not required for a
complete equivalence of locally inertial and coaccelerated points of views.

We show that there is a line of fixed-points in the renormalization group flow

undergoes a strong increase with respect to the noninteracting theory, as a
consequence of the unconventional screening of the Coulomb and disorder-induced

matter, $\alpha$DM can have a large Jeans length which could resolve the
cusp-core and substructure problems faced by standard cold dark matter.
$\alpha$DM also has an appealing tracker property which enables it to converge
to the late-time dark matter asymptote, $\langle w\rangle \simeq 0$, from a
wide range of initial conditions. It thus avoids the enormous fine-tuning

  Biology to Epidemiology","48 pages, 12 figures, 2 calculations, 5 tables",,,,"q-bio.TO physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Zika virus has been found in individual cases but has not been confirmed
as the cause of in the large number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil in
2015-6. Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly
across geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here
we consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking
water might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile
hormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat
soluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin
A, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development
has been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone
analog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause
developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing
microcephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.
We review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually
found some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and
arhinencephaly in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is
unprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale.
Claims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not
been documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly
cases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different
states across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim
that Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular
mechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend
that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal
link to microcephaly is investigated further.

ambitions to be ""lean"", in other words, avoid waste and re-engineering by
making sure that the process is customer-driven and rational. Emphasis is on
efficiency rather than effectiveness. This set-up poses new demands to the

an alternative to Gaussian quadrature for stochastic collocation. The key idea
is to use cluster centers as the nodes for collocation. In this way, we can
extend the use of collocation methods to uncertainty propagation with
multivariate, dependent input, in which the output approximation is piecewise
constant on the clusters. The approach is particularly useful in situations
where the probability distribution of the input is unknown, and only a sample
from the input distribution is available. We examine several clustering methods
and assess the convergence of collocation based on these methods both
theoretically and numerically. We demonstrate good performance of the proposed
methods, most notably for the challenging case of nonlinearly dependent inputs
in higher dimensions. Numerical tests with input dimension up to 16 are
included, using as benchmarks the Genz test functions and a test case from
computational fluid dynamics (lid-driven cavity flow).

  http://yenchenlin.me/adversarial_attack_RL/",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce two tactics to attack agents trained by deep reinforcement
learning algorithms using adversarial examples, namely the strategically-timed
attack and the enchanting attack. In the strategically-timed attack, the
adversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by only attacking the agent at
a small subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity to
this subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a
novel method to determine when an adversarial example should be crafted and
applied. In the enchanting attack, the adversary aims at luring the agent to a
designated target state. This is achieved by combining a generative model and a
planning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the
planning algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the
agent. A sequence of adversarial examples is then crafted to lure the agent to
take the preferred sequence of actions. We apply the two tactics to the agents
trained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm including
DQN and A3C. In 5 Atari games, our strategically timed attack reduces as much
reward as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at every time step) does by
attacking the agent 4 times less often. Our enchanting attack lures the agent
toward designated target states with a more than 70% success rate. Videos are

scalars in wall-bounded flows. The relations equate the dissipation rate for
either passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs from the
initial values, boundary values, and internal sources, as those are sampled
backward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic
concepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the
boundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are
imposed and the boundary first hitting-time at points where scalar values are
imposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the
problem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of
channel-flow flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing
properties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the
fluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the
relation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous
stochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle
trajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. In the first
paper of this series, we showed that spontaneous stochasticity is the only
possible mechanism for anomalous dissipation of passive or active scalars, away
from walls. Here it is shown that this remains true when there are no scalar
fluxes through walls. Simple examples show, on the other hand, that a distinct
mechanism of non-vanishing scalar dissipation can be thin scalar boundary
layers near the walls. Nevertheless, we prove for general wall-bounded flows
that spontaneous stochasticity is another possible mechanism of anomalous
scalar dissipation.

work to describe the dissipation rate of advected scalars, both passive and
active, in wall-bounded flows. We apply this relation here to develop a
Lagrangian description of thermal dissipation in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection in a right-cylindrical cell of arbitrary cross-section, with either
imposed temperature difference or imposed heat-flux at the top and bottom
walls. We obtain an exact relation between the steady-state thermal dissipation
rate and the time for passive tracer particles released at the top or bottom
wall to mix to their final uniform value near those walls. We show that an
""ultimate regime"" with the Nusselt-number scaling predicted by Spiegel (1971)
or, with a log-correction, by Kraichnan (1962) will occur at high Rayleigh
numbers, unless this near-wall mixing time is asymptotically much longer than
the free-fall time, or almost the large-scale circulation time. We suggest a
new criterion for an ultimate regime in terms of transition to turbulence of a
thermal ""mixing zone"", which is much wider than the standard thermal boundary
layer. Kraichnan-Spiegel scaling may, however, not hold if the intensity and
volume of thermal plumes decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing Rayleigh
number. To help resolve this issue, we suggest a program to measure the
near-wall mixing time, which we argue is accessible both by laboratory
experiment and by numerical simulation.
