dynamics, containing behaviors separated by tens of orders of magnitude in
scale. While direct simulations have made large strides toward understanding
geophysical systems, such models still inhabit modest ranges of the governing
parameters that are difficult to extrapolate to planetary settings. The
canonical problem of rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection provides an
alternate approach - isolating the fundamental physics in a reduced setting.
Theoretical studies and asymptotically-reduced simulations in rotating
convection have unveiled a variety of flow behaviors likely relevant to natural
systems, but still inaccessible to direct simulation. In lieu of this, several
new large-scale rotating convection devices have been designed to characterize
such behaviors. It is essential to predict how this potential influx of new
data will mesh with existing results. Surprisingly, a coherent framework of
predictions for extreme rotating convection has not yet been elucidated. In
this study, we combine asymptotic predictions, laboratory and numerical
results, and experimental constraints to build a heuristic framework for
cross-comparison between a broad range of rotating convection studies. We
categorize the diverse field of existing predictions in the context of
asymptotic flow regimes. We then consider the physical constraints that
determine the points of intersection between flow behavior predictions and
experimental accessibility. Applying this framework to several upcoming devices
demonstrates that laboratory studies may soon be able to characterize
geophysically-relevant flow regimes. These new data may transform our
understanding of geophysical and astrophysical turbulence, and the conceptual
framework developed herein should provide the theoretical infrastructure needed
for meaningful discussion of these results.

nodal, if it vanishes for a direction in momentum space, or gapful if it does
not. Each class can be topologically nontrivial if Andreev bound states are
formed at the edges of the superconductor. Non-magnetic impurities in the
superconductor affect the formation of Andreev bound states and can drastically
change the tunneling spectra for small voltages. Here, we investigate the mean
current and its fluctuations for two-dimensional tunnel junctions between a
normal-metal and unconventional superconductors by solving the quasi-classical
Eilenberger equation self-consistently, including the presence of non-magnetic
impurities in the superconductor. As the impurity strength increases, we find
that superconductivity is suppressed for almost all order parameters since (i)
at zero applied bias, the effective transferred charge calculated from the
noise-current ratio tends to the electron charge $e$ and (ii) for finite bias,
the current-voltage characteristics follows that of a normal state junction.
There are notable exceptions to this trend. First, gapful nontrivial (chiral)
superconductors are very robust against impurity scattering due to the linear
dispersion relation of their surface Andreev bound states. Second, for nodal
nontrivial superconductors, only p_x-wave pairing is almost immune to the
presence of impurities due to the emergence of odd-frequency s-wave Cooper
pairs near the interface. Owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave
vector, impurity scattering is an effective pair breaking mechanism for the
rest of nodal superconductors. All these behaviors are neatly captured by the
noise-current ratio, providing a useful guide to find experimental signatures
for unconventional superconductivity.

common objects in the computer graphics or topological data analysis

question for applications, where it matters to quantify the extent by which two
given Reeb graphs differ. Recent contributions emphasize this aspect, proposing
novel distances such as {\em functional distortion} or {\em interleaving} that
are provably more discriminative than the so-called {\em bottleneck distance},
being true metrics whereas the latter is only a pseudo-metric. Their main
drawback compared to the bottleneck distance is to be comparatively hard (if at
all possible) to evaluate. Here we take the opposite view on the problem and
show that the bottleneck distance is in fact good enough {\em locally}, in the
sense that it is able to discriminate a Reeb graph from any other Reeb graph in
a small enough neighborhood, as efficiently as the other metrics do. This
suggests considering the {\em intrinsic metrics} induced by these distances,
which turn out to be all {\em globally} equivalent. This novel viewpoint on the
study of Reeb graphs has a potential impact on applications, where one may not
only be interested in discriminating between data but also in interpolating

applications. Moreover, colloids exhibit a wide range of structures under
confinement that could considerably alter the viscosity. Here, we use a
combination of experiments and simulations to elucidate how confinement induced
structures alter the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and repulsive
forces to produce up to a ten fold change in the viscosity. We use a custom
built confocal rheoscope to image the particle configurations of a colloidal
suspension while simultaneously measuring the viscosity. We find a
non-monotonic trend to the viscosity under confinement that is strongly
correlated with the microstructure. As the gap decreases below 15 particle
diameters, the viscosity first decreases from its bulk value, shows
fluctuations with the gap, and then sharply increases for gaps below three
particle diameters. Further, we compare our experimental results to two
simulations techniques that enables us to determine the relative contributions
of hydrodynamic and short range repulsive stresses. The first method uses the
lubrication approximation to find the hydrodynamic stress and includes a short
range repulsive force between the particles and the second is a Stokesian
dynamics simulation that calculates the full hydrodynamic stress in the
suspension. We find that the decrease in the viscosity at moderate confinements
has a significant contribution from both the hydrodynamic and repulsive forces
whereas the increase in viscosity at gaps less than three particle diameters
arises primarily from short range repulsive forces. These results provide new
insights to the unique rheological behavior of confined suspensions and further
enable us to tune the viscosity by changing properties such as the gap,
polydispersity, and the volume fraction.

associated with one of the n possible contacting body parts. During execution,
the policy corresponding to the highest value function will be executed while
the associated body part will be the next contact with the ground. With this
mixture of actor-critic architecture, the discrete contact sequence planning is
solved through the selection of the best critics while the continuous control

extending the phenomenologically viable parameter space beyond the highly

easing away from the vanishing SUSY breaking terms enables a more broad mass
range of vector-like particles, dubbed flippons, including flippons less than 1
TeV that could presently be observed at the LHC2, as well as a lighter gluino
mass and SUSY spectrum overall. This presents heightened odds that the General

The phenomenology comprises both bino and higgsino dark matter, including a
Higgs funnel region. Particle states emerging from the SUSY cascade decays are

field is expected from theoretical predictions and self-consistent
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to be present in the specific case of
protostellar outflows. Hence, such an outflow environment is the perfect for
our study. Methodes: We present synthetic polarisation maps in the infrared and
millimeter regime of protostellar outflows performed with the newly developed
RT and polarisation code POLARIS. The code, as the first, includes a
self-consistent description of various alignement mechanism like the imperfect
Davis-Greenstein (IDG) and the radiative torque (RAT) alignment. We investigate
for which effects the grain size distribution, and applied alignement mechanism
have. Results: We find that the IDG mechanism cannot produce any measurable
polarization degree (< 1 %) whereas RAT alignment produced polarization degrees
of a few 1 %. Furthermore, we developed a method to identify the origin of the
polarization. We show that the helical magnetic field in the outflow can only
be observed close to the outflow axis and at its tip, whereas in the
surrounding regions the hourglass field in the foreground dominates the
polarization. Furthermore, the polarization degree in the outflow lobe is lower
than in the surroundings in agreement with observations. We also find that the
orientation of the polarization vector flips around a few 100 micron due to the
transition from dichroic extinction to thermal re-emission. Hence, in order to
avoid ambiguities when interpreting polarization data, we suggest to observed
in the far-infrared and mm regime. Finally, we show that with ALMA it is
possible to observe the polarization emerging from protostellar outflows.

interaction with another system. We study bar formation in disky dwarf galaxies
orbiting a Milky Way-like galaxy. We employ $N$-body simulations to study the
impact of initial orbital parameters: the size of the dwarf galaxy orbit and
the inclination of its disc with respect to the orbital plane. In all cases a
bar develops in the center of the dwarf during the first pericenter on its
orbit around the host. Between subsequent pericenter passages the bars are
stable, but at the pericenters they are usually weakened and shortened. The
initial properties and details of the further evolution of the bars depend
heavily on the orbital configuration. We find that for the exactly prograde
orientation, the strongest bar is formed for the intermediate-size orbit. On
the tighter orbit, the disc is too disturbed and stripped to form a strong bar.
On the wider orbit, the tidal interaction is too weak. The dependence on the
disc inclination is such that weaker bars form in more inclined discs. The bars
experience either a very weak buckling or none at all. We do not observe any
secular evolution, possibly because the dwarfs are perturbed at each pericenter
passage. The rotation speed of the bars can be classified as slow
($R_\mathrm{CR}/l_\mathrm{bar}\sim2-3$). We attribute this to the loss of a
significant fraction of the disc's rotation during the encounter with the host
galaxy.

a local copy of some dynamical system (internal model). Synchronization of

to sophisticated dynamical (and, in general, nonlinear) controllers. At the
same time, passive heterogeneous agents can be synchronized by a very simple
linear protocol, which is used for consensus of first-order integrators. A
natural question arises whether analogous algorithms are applicable to
synchronization of agents that do not satisfy the passivity condition. In this
paper, we study the synchronization problem for heterogeneous agents that are
not passive but satisfy a weaker input feedforward passivity (IFP) condition.
We show that such agents can also be synchronized by a simple linear protocol,
provided that the interaction graph is strongly connected and the couplings are
sufficiently weak. We demonstrate how stability of cooperative adaptive cruise
control algorithms and some microscopic traffic flow models reduce to
synchronization of heterogeneous IFP agents.

preventing any secondary inference on the data, we introduce Siamese
fine-tuning. We evaluate the privacy benefits of this approach based on the
information exposed to the cloud service. We also assess the local inference
cost of different layers on a modern handset. Our evaluations show that by
using Siamese fine-tuning and at a small processing cost, we can greatly reduce

simple observation: if we pick an edge uniformly at random in the network, this
edge is more likely to connect two nodes of the same community than two nodes
of distinct communities. We exploit this idea to build communities by local
changes at each edge arrival. Using theoretical arguments, we relate the
ability of SCoDA to detect communities to usual quality metrics of these
communities like the conductance. Experimental results performed on massive
real-life networks ranging from one million to more than one billion edges
shows that SCoDA runs more than ten times faster than existing algorithms and
leads to similar or better detection scores on the largest graphs.

galactic nuclei is still unclear. I propose that condensations form in the
warm, radiation pressure driven, accretion disk wind of quasars creating the
BEL clouds and uniting them with the other two manifestations of cool, 10,000
K, gas in quasars, the low ionization phase of the warm absorbers (WAs) and the
clouds causing X-ray eclipses. The cool clouds will condense quickly (days to
years), before the WA outflows reach escape velocity (which takes months to
centuries). Cool clouds form in equilibrium with the warm phase of the wind
because the rapidly varying X-ray quasar continuum changes the force
multiplier, causing pressure waves to move gas into stable locations in
pressure-temperature space. The narrow range of 2-phase equilibrium densities
may explain the scaling of the BELR size with the square root of luminosity,
while the scaling of cloud formation timescales could produce the Baldwin
effect. These dense clouds have force multipliers of order unity and so cannot
be accelerated to escape velocity. They fall back on a dynamical timescale
(months to centuries), producing an inflow that rains down toward the central
black hole. As they soon move at Mach ~40 with respect to the WA outflow, these
'raindrops' will be rapidly destroyed within months. This rain of clouds may
produce the elliptical BELR orbits implied by velocity resolved reverberation
mapping in some objects, and can explain the opening angle and destruction
timescale of the narrow 'cometary' tails of the clouds seen in X-ray eclipse
observations. Some consequences and challenges of this 'quasar rain' model are
presented along with several avenues for theoretical investigation.

resolution so far ($0\rlap.""12\times0\rlap.""09$, or 14 au$\times$11 au, at 7
mm). Our 7 and 9 mm images show a narrow ring of emission at a radius of
$\sim25$ au tracing the outer edge of the inner gap. This ring presents an
asymmetric morphology that could be produced by dynamical interactions between
the disk and forming planets. Additionally, the azimuthally averaged radial
intensity profiles of the 7 and 9 mm images confirm the presence of the
previously reported gap at $\sim45$ au, and reveal a new gap at $\sim85$ au. We
analyzed archival DCO$^+$(3-2) and C$^{18}$O(2-1) ALMA observations, showing
that the CO snowline is located very close to this third outer gap. This
suggests that growth and accumulation of large dust grains close to the CO
snowline could be the mechanism responsible for this proposed outer gap.
Finally, a compact source of emission is detected at 7 mm, 9 mm, and 3 cm
toward the center of the disk. Its flux density and spectral index indicate
that it is dominated by free-free emission from ionized gas, which could be

Here, we address the pioneering minimum-error (ME) measurement and give the
first experimental demonstration of its application for discriminating
nonorthogonal states in high dimensions. Our scheme is designed to distinguish
symmetric pure states encoded in the transverse spatial modes of an optical
field; the optimal measurement is performed by a projection onto the Fourier
transform basis of these modes. For dimensions ranging from D = 2 to D = 21 and
nearly 14000 states tested, the deviations of the experimental results from the
theoretical values range from 0.3% to 3.6% (getting below 2% for the vast

measurement is a building block for high-dimensional implementations of many
quantum communication protocols, including probabilistic state discrimination,
dense coding with nonmaximal entanglement, and cryptographic schemes.

extending the logistic growth model in its usual r - K parametrization to a

to as the ""perfect mixing paradox"". This led the authors to recommend using the
Verhulst r - {\alpha} parametrization of the logistic model instead and
abandoning the term ""carrying capacity"" in the context of population dynamics.
In this study we show that the use of the logistic equation in its traditional
r - K parametrization is appropriate for representing the dynamics of
populations in a simple spatial context with passive migration among patches.
Furthermore, we show that the conclusions of the mentioned paper depend on the
specific functional form for migration rates used for their analyses. In
addition, we suggest that their specific migration model was not the best
choice since biologically realistic options exist. Moreover, these alternatives
require the same number of parameters. The model we present here is free of the
paradoxical behaviors presented previously. This allows us to conclude that the
logistic growth in its usual r - K parametrization is useful in a spatial
context if extended appropriately to a multi-patch scenario and consequently
there are no reasons to abandon the concept of carrying capacity. Ecologists
should pay great attention when using models in scenarios that are more complex
or just different from the ones for which the models were created.

enhanced dense gas fraction, the subthermal gas excitation, and the lower than
expected star formation efficiency of the dense molecular gas in EGS 13004291

element Na; $\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, Ca, Ti; Fe-peak and heavy elements Sc, V,

systematic errors) agrees well with the values from individual, low-resolution
measurements of individual stars, but it is lower than previous high-resolution
results of a small number of stars in the literature. Comparison with Galactic
halo stars and other disrupted and unperturbed GCs renders Pal~5 a typical
representative of the Milky Way halo population, as has been noted before,
emphasizing that the early chemical evolution of such clusters is decoupled
from their later dynamical history. We also performed a test as to the
detectability of light element variations in this co-added abundance analysis

a broad range in sodium of $\sim$0.6 dex, a value typically found in the old

chemical distinctions of their multiple stellar populations is still best

generalising the study of Jones et al (2012), we demonstrate that this
parameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of
evolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of
outside in clearing by external photoevaporation. We use this result to assess
the reliability of disc mass estimates derived from CO isotopologues and submm
continuum emission by examining the distribution of accretion efficiencies in
regions which are not subject to external photoevaporation. We find that while
dust based mass estimates produce results compatible with theoretical
expectations assuming canonical dust/gas ratio, the systematically lower CO
based estimates yield accretion efficiencies significantly above unity in
contrast with the theory. This finding provides additional evidence that CO
based disc masses are an under-estimate, in line with arguments that have been
made on the basis of chemical modelling of relatively small samples. On the
other hand, we demonstrate that dust based mass estimates are sufficiently
accurate to reveal distinctly higher accretion efficiencies in the Trapezium
cluster, where this result is expected given the evident importance of external
photoevaporation. We therefore propose the dimensionless accretion parameter as
a new diagnostic of external photoevaporation in other star forming regions.

photometric and kinematic properties of the sample bulges to study their
location in the Fundamental Plane, Kormendy, and Faber-Jackson relations
defined for ellipticals and large bulges. We found that our sample bulges
satisfy some of the photometric and kinematic prescriptions for being
considered disk-like bulges such as small sizes and masses with nearly
exponential light profiles, small bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, low stellar
velocity dispersions, and ongoing star formation. However, each of them follows
the same scaling relations of ellipticals, massive bulges, and compact
early-type galaxies so they cannot be classified as disk-like systems. We find
a single population of galaxy spheroids that follow the same scaling relations,

mass spectrum, which turn out to be comparable in size to those coming from the
Sommerfeld enhancement. We apply the calculation to three scenarios: bino-stop
and bino-sbottom co-annihilations in supersymmetry, and a vector dark matter
co-annihilating with a fermionic top partner. In addition, we confront our
analysis of the relic abundance with recent direct detection experiments and
collider searches at the LHC, which have important implications in the
bino-stop and bino-sbottom scenarios. In particular, in the bino-stop case
recent LHC limits have excluded regions of parameter with a direct detection
rate that is above the neutrino floor.

II has presented the most difficulty in revealing its dynamical status. Kirby

with a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius of 3600 +3500 -2100
M_sun/L_sun. On the other hand, Martin et al. (2016) measured an outer velocity
dispersion that is 3.5 +/- 2.1 times larger than the central velocity
dispersion, suggesting that the system might not be in equilibrium. From new
multi-epoch Keck/DEIMOS measurements of 13 member stars in Triangulum II, we
constrain the velocity dispersion to be sigma_v < 3.4 km/s (90% C.L.). Our
previous measurement of sigma_v, based on six stars, was inflated by the
presence of a binary star with variable radial velocity. We find no evidence
that the velocity dispersion increases with radius. The stars display a wide
range of metallicities, indicating that Triangulum II retained supernova ejecta
and therefore possesses or once possessed a massive dark matter halo. However,
the detection of a metallicity dispersion hinges on the membership of the two
most metal-rich stars. The stellar mass is lower than galaxies of similar mean
stellar metallicity, which might indicate that Triangulum II is either a star
cluster or a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy. Detailed abundances of one star
show heavily depressed neutron-capture abundances, similar to stars in most
other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies but unlike stars in globular clusters.

properties of the lens and the lensing model obtained with LENSTOOL. The
rest-frame optical morphology of this system is strongly dominated by the lens,
while the Ruby itself is highly obscured, and contributes less than 10% to the

NB964 for the superb large-area Dark-Energy Camera (DECam) on the NOAO/CTIO 4m
Blanco telescope, LAGER has collected 34 hours NB964 narrowband imaging data in
the 3 deg$^2$ COSMOS field. We have identified 23 Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE)
candidates at $z$ = 6.9 in the central 2-deg$^2$ region, where DECam and public
COSMOS multi-band images exist. The resulting luminosity function can be
described as a Schechter function modified by a significant excess at the
bright end (4 galaxies with $L_{Ly\alpha} \sim $ 10$^{43.4\pm0.2}$ erg
s$^{-1}$). The number density at $L_{Ly\alpha}\sim$ 10$^{43.4\pm0.2}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ is little changed from z= 6.6, while at fainter $L_{Ly\alpha}$ it is
substantially reduced. Overall, we see a fourfold reduction in Ly$\alpha$
luminosity density from $z$ = 5.7 to 6.9. Combined with a more modest evolution
of the continuum UV luminosity density, this suggests a factor of $\sim 3$
suppression of Ly$\alpha$ by radiative transfer through the $z \sim$ 7
intergalactic medium (IGM). It indicates an IGM neutral fraction $x_{HI}$
$\sim$ 0.4--0.6 (assuming Ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets of 100-200 km s$^{-1}$).
The changing shape of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function between $z\lesssim
6.6$ and $z=6.9$ supports the hypothesis of ionized bubbles in a patchy
reionization at $z\sim$ 7.

recent experiments. We provide an analytic solution for the zero modes in a
continuous nematic vortex. In lattice, crystalline anisotropy can pin the
two-component order parameter along high-symmetry directions. We show that a
discrete nematic vortex, which forms when three nematic domains meet, also
supports a TR pair of Majorana modes. Finally, we discuss possible experiments

focuses on local observables. Thermodynamic entropy can also be recovered as
the entanglement entropy of small subsystems. When the size of the subsystem
increases, however, quantum correlations break the correspondence and cause a
correction to this simple volume-law. To elucidate the size dependence of the
entanglement entropy is of essential importance in linking quantum physics with
thermodynamics, and in addressing recent experiments in ultra-cold atoms. Here
we derive an analytic formula of the entanglement entropy for a class of pure
states called cTPQ states representing thermal equilibrium. We further find
that our formula applies universally to any sufficiently scrambled pure states
representing thermal equilibrium, i.e., general energy eigenstates of
non-integrable models and states after quantum quenches. Our universal formula
can be exploited as a diagnostic of chaotic systems; we can distinguish
integrable models from chaotic ones and detect many-body localization with high
accuracy.

directly image exoplanets. Among these designs, the vector vortex coronagraphs
provide theoretically perfect starlight cancellation along with small inner
working angles when deployed on telescopes with unobstructed pupils. However,
current and planned space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes
present complex pupil geometries, including secondary mirror central
obscurations, that prevent vortex coronagraphs from rejecting on-axis sources
entirely. Recent solutions combining the vortex phase mask with a ring-apodized
pupil have been proposed to circumvent this issue, but provide a limited
throughput for vortex charges $>2$. We present a family of pupil plane
apodizations that compensate for pupil geometries with circularly symmetric
central obstructions caused by on-axis secondary mirrors for charge 2, 4, and 6
vector vortex coronagraphs. These apodizations are derived analytically and
allow the vortex coronagraph to retain theoretically perfect nulling in the
presence of central obscurations. For a charge 4 vortex, we design polynomial
apodization functions assuming a greyscale apodizing filter that represent a
substantial gain in throughput over the ring-apodized vortex coronagraph
design, while for a charge 6 vortex, we design polynomial apodized vortex
coronagraphs that have $\gtrsim 70\%$ total energy throughput for the entire
range of central obscuration sizes studied. We propose methods for optimizing
apodizations produced with either greyscale apodizing filters or shaped
mirrors. We conclude by demonstrating how this design may be combined with
apodizations numerically optimized for struts and segment gaps in telescope
pupils to design terrestrial exoplanet imagers for complex pupils.

emitting plasma heats and then cools. Although accurately modeling this
evolution has been historically difficult, especially for empirical
relationships, it is important for understanding processes at the Sun, as well
as for their influence on planetary atmospheres. With a goal to improve
empirical flare models, a new simple empirical expression is derived to predict
how cool emissions will evolve based on the evolution of a hotter emission.
This technique is initially developed by studying 12 flares in detail observed
by the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). Then, over 1100 flares observed by EVE are analyzed to validate these
relationships. The Cargill and Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops
(EBTEL) flare cooling models are used to show that this empirical relationship
implies the energy radiated by a population of hotter formed ions is
approximately proportional to the energy exciting a population of cooler formed
ions emitting when the peak formation temperatures of the two lines are up to
72% of each other and above 2 MK. These results have practical implications for
improving flare irradiance empirical modeling and for identifying key emission
lines for future monitoring of flares for space weather operations; and also
provide insight into the cooling processes of flare plasma.

matrix $A$ with low rank expectation $E(A) = XSY^T$ and independent Poisson
elements. This allows for quickly sampling from a broad class of stochastic
blockmodel graphs (degree-corrected, mixed membership, overlapping) all of
which are specific parameterizations of the generalized random product graph
model defined in Section 2.2. The basic idea of fastRG is to first sample the
number of edges $m$ and then sample each edge. The key insight is that because
of the the low rank expectation, it is easy to sample individual edges. The
naive ""element-wise"" algorithm requires $O(n^2)$ operations to generate the
$n\times n$ adjacency matrix $A$. In sparse graphs, where $m = O(n)$, ignoring
log terms, fastRG runs in time $O(n)$. An implementation in fastRG is available
on github. A computational experiment in Section 2.4 simulates graphs up to
$n=10,000,000$ nodes with $m = 100,000,000$ edges. For example, on a graph with
$n=500,000$ and $m = 5,000,000$, fastRG runs in less than one second on a 3.5

Heat-bath algorithmic cooling has been shown to purify qubits by controlled
redistribution of entropy and multiple contact with a bath, not only for
ensemble implementations but also for technologies with strong but imperfect
measurements. However, an implicit restriction about the interaction with the
bath has been assumed in previous work. In this paper, we show that better
purification can be achieved by removing that restriction. More concretely, we
include correlations between the system and the bath, and we take advantage of
these correlations to pump entropy out of the system into the bath. We
introduce a tool for cooling algorithms, which we call ""state-reset"", obtained
when the coupling to the environment is generalized from individual-qubits
relaxation to correlated-qubit relaxation. We present improved cooling
algorithms which lead to an increase of purity beyond all the previous work,

the CO luminosity, $\alpha_{\rm CO}$. For the Milky Way value of $\alpha_{\rm

consistent with previous claims of star formation being induced in Minkowski's

of metals. Electrochemical oxidation lowers the effective interfacial tension
of a gallium-based liquid metal alloy to values approaching zero, thereby
inducing drastic shape changes, including the formation of fractals. The
measured fractal dimension ($D = 1.3 \pm 0.05$) places the instability in a
different universality class than other fingering instabilities. By
characterizing changes in morphology and dynamics as a function of droplet
volume and applied electric potential, we identify the three main forces
involved in this process: interfacial tension, gravity, and oxidative stress.
Importantly, we find that electrochemical oxidation can generate compressive
interfacial forces that oppose the tensile forces at a liquid interface. Thus,
the surface oxide layer not only induces instabilities, but ultimately provides
a physical barrier that halts the instabilities at larger positive potentials.
Controlling the competition between surface tension and oxidative (compressive)
stresses at the interface is important for the development of reconfigurable
electronic, electromagnetic, and optical devices that take advantage of the

constraints can be placed on the SN ejecta mass and explosion energy, which
appear to require a stripped envelope (Type Ib/c) SN and/or a very energetic
explosion. A third FRB from this location would be even more constraining,
allowing the component of the DM due to the SNR to be separated from the
unchanging DM components due to the host galaxy and intergalactic medium. In
the future, if more FRBs are found to repeat, the sort of arguments presented
here can be used to test the young neutron star progenitor hypothesis for FRBs.

Kogan, Zijia Li","Degree-optimal moving frames for rational curves","Edited introduction",,,,"math.AG math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $\mathit{\text{moving frame}}$ at a rational curve is a basis of vectors
moving along the curve. When the rational curve is given parametrically by a
row vector $\mathbf{a}$ of univariate polynomials, a moving frame with
important algebraic properties can be defined by the columns of an invertible
polynomial matrix $P$, such that $\mathbf{a} P=[\gcd(\mathbf{a}),0\ldots,0]$. A
$\mathit{\text{degree-optimal moving frame}}$ has column-wise minimal degree,
where the degree of a column is defined to be the maximum of the degrees of its
components. Algebraic moving frames are closely related to the univariate
versions of the celebrated Quillen-Suslin problem, effective Nullstellensatz
problem, and syzygy module problem. However, this paper appears to be the first
devoted to finding an efficient algorithm for constructing a degree-optimal
moving frame, a property desirable in various applications. We compare our
algorithm with other possible approaches, based on already available
algorithms, and show that it is more efficient. We also establish several new
theoretical results concerning the degrees of an optimal moving frame and its
components. In addition, we show that any deterministic algorithm for computing
a degree-optimal algebraic moving frame can be augmented so that it assigns a
degree-optimal moving frame in a $GL_n(\mathbb{K})$-equivariant manner. This
crucial property of classical geometric moving frames, in combination with the
algebraic properties, can be exploited in various problems.

the edge region from a multiscale neoclassical and turbulent XGC1 gyrokinetic
simulation in a DIII-D like tokamak geometry, here excluding neutrals and
collisions. For an H-mode type plasma with steep pedestal, it is found that the
electron density fluctuations increase towards the separatrix, and stay high
well into the SOL, reaching a maximum value of $\delta n_e / \bar{n}_e \sim
0.18$. Blobs are observed, born around the magnetic separatrix surface and
propagate radially outward with velocities generally less than 1 km/s. Strong
poloidal motion of the blobs is also present, near 20 km/s, consistent with $E
\times B$ rotation. The electron density fluctuations show a negative skewness
in the closed field line pedestal regions, consistent with the presence of
""holes"", followed by a transition to strong positive skewness across the
separatrix and into the SOL. These simulations indicate that not only
neoclassical phenomena, but also turbulence, including the blob-generation
mechanism, can remain important in the steep H-mode pedestal and SOL.
Qualitative comparisons will be made to experimental observations.

Centers (OFCs) facilitate these structures through low taxation and lenient

avoidance. Therefore, the identification of OFC jurisdictions has become a
politicized and contested issue. We introduce a novel data-driven approach for
identifying OFCs based on the global corporate ownership network, in which over
98 million firms (nodes) are connected through 71 million ownership relations.
This granular firm-level network data uniquely allows identifying both
sink-OFCs and conduit-OFCs. Sink-OFCs attract and retain foreign capital while
conduit-OFCs are attractive intermediate destinations in the routing of
international investments and enable the transfer of capital without taxation.
We identify 24 sink-OFCs. In addition, a small set of five countries -- the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland -- canalize
the majority of corporate offshore investment as conduit-OFCs. Each conduit
jurisdiction is specialized in a geographical area and there is significant
specialization based on industrial sectors. Against the idea of OFCs as exotic
small islands that cannot be regulated, we show that many sink and conduit-OFCs
are highly developed countries.

users may eventually need to pay to get additional features and-or remove ads.
While paid apps have clear market values, their ads-supported versions are not

  In this paper, first, we perform an exploratory study about ads-supported and
paid apps to understand their differences in terms of implementation and
development process. We analyze 40 Android apps and we observe that (i)
ads-supported apps are preferred by users although paid apps have a better
rating, (ii) developers do not usually offer a paid app without a corresponding
free version, (iii) ads-supported apps usually have more releases and are

ads-supported apps use more resources than their corresponding paid versions

Convolutional Networks (GCN) for brain analysis in populations, combining

its vertices are associated with image-based feature vectors and the edges
encode phenotypic information. This structure was used to train a GCN model on
partially labelled graphs, aiming to infer the classes of unlabelled nodes from
the node features and pairwise associations between subjects. We demonstrate
the potential of the method on the challenging ADNI and ABIDE databases, as a
proof of concept of the benefit from integrating contextual information in
classification tasks. This has a clear impact on the quality of the
predictions, leading to 69.5% accuracy for ABIDE (outperforming the current

pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity
by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of

resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the

models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control
using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes
of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is
shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent
control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a
superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically
observed corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows
straightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing
one-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological
psychology traditions. Empirical observations from a driving simulator provide
support for some of the framework assumptions: It is shown that human steering
control, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better
described as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as
continuous control. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steering
adjustments are well predicted by a compound visual cue signalling steering
error, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue
is affected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumulation is shown to
explain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and
adjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold
mechanisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent
control.

Chemical reactions at the catalytic spheres that convert fuel to product

momentum conservation in the microscopic dynamics. The collective behavior of
the many-body system is influenced by direct intermolecular interactions among
the motors, chemotactic effects due to chemical gradients, hydrodynamic

We show how the causality paradox is resolved in the fuzzball paradigm. One
needs to distinguish between two kinds of Rindler spaces: (a) Rindler space
obtained by choosing accelerating coordinates in Minkowski space and (b)
`pseudo-Rindler' space, which describes the region near the surface of a
fuzzball. These two spaces differ in their vacuum fluctuations. While low
energy waves propagate the same way on both spaces, infalling objects with
energies $E\gg T$ suffer an `entropy enhanced tunneling' in the pseudo-Rindler
spacetime (b); this leads to the nucleation of a fuzzball before the infalling
object gets trapped inside a horizon.

OPF, that is, obtaining near optimal primal solutions as well as high quality

out impact simulations of gravity-dominated planetesimals for a wide range of
specific impact energy (Q_R) from disruptive collisions (Q_R ~ Q_RD^*) to
erosive ones (Q_R << Q_RD^*) using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method.
We found that the ejected mass normalized by the total mass (M_ej/M_tot)
depends on the numerical resolution, the target radius (R_tar) and the impact
velocity (v_imp), as well as on Q_R, but that it can be nicely scaled by Q_RD^*
for the parameter ranges investigated (R_tar = 30-300 km, v_imp = 2-5 km/s).
This means that M_ej/M_tot depends only on Q_R/Q_RD^* in these parameter
ranges. We confirmed that the collision outcomes for much less erosive
collisions (Q_R < 0.01 Q_RD^*) converge to the results of an impact onto a
planar target for various impact angles and that M_ej/M_tot = C * QR/QRD*
holds. For disruptive collisions (Q_R ~ Q_RD^*), the curvature of the target
has a significant effect on Mej/Mtot. We also examined the angle-averaged value
of M_ej/M_tot and found that the numerically obtained relation between
angle-averaged M_ej/M_tot and Q_R/Q_RD^* is very similar to the cases for
45-degree impacts. We proposed a new erosion model based on our numerical
simulations for future research on planet formation with collisional erosion.

detection, computers still struggle to understand the interdependency of
objects in the scene as a whole, e.g., relations between objects or their
attributes. Existing methods often ignore global context cues capturing the
interactions among different object instances, and can only recognize a handful
of types by exhaustively training individual detectors for all possible
relationships. To capture such global interdependency, we propose a deep
Variation-structured Reinforcement Learning (VRL) framework to sequentially
discover object relationships and attributes in the whole image. First, a
directed semantic action graph is built using language priors to provide a rich
and compact representation of semantic correlations between object categories,
predicates, and attributes. Next, we use a variation-structured traversal over
the action graph to construct a small, adaptive action set for each step based
on the current state and historical actions. In particular, an ambiguity-aware
object mining scheme is used to resolve semantic ambiguity among object
categories that the object detector fails to distinguish. We then make
sequential predictions using a deep RL framework, incorporating global context
cues and semantic embeddings of previously extracted phrases in the state
vector. Our experiments on the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) dataset and
the large-scale Visual Genome dataset validate the superiority of VRL, which
can achieve significantly better detection results on datasets involving
thousands of relationship and attribute types. We also demonstrate that VRL is
able to predict unseen types embedded in our action graph by learning
correlations on shared graph nodes.

representation via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks over
hierarchal graph structures. Instead of learning LSTM models over the pre-fixed
structures, we propose to further learn the intermediate interpretable
multi-level graph structures in a progressive and stochastic way from data
during the LSTM network optimization. We thus call this model the
structure-evolving LSTM. In particular, starting with an initial element-level
graph representation where each node is a small data element, the
structure-evolving LSTM gradually evolves the multi-level graph representations
by stochastically merging the graph nodes with high compatibilities along the
stacked LSTM layers. In each LSTM layer, we estimate the compatibility of two
connected nodes from their corresponding LSTM gate outputs, which is used to
generate a merging probability. The candidate graph structures are accordingly
generated where the nodes are grouped into cliques with their merging
probabilities. We then produce the new graph structure with a
Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, which alleviates the risk of getting stuck in
local optimums by stochastic sampling with an acceptance probability. Once a
graph structure is accepted, a higher-level graph is then constructed by taking
the partitioned cliques as its nodes. During the evolving process,
representation becomes more abstracted in higher-levels where redundant
information is filtered out, allowing more efficient propagation of long-range
data dependencies. We evaluate the effectiveness of structure-evolving LSTM in
the application of semantic object parsing and demonstrate its advantage over
state-of-the-art LSTM models on standard benchmarks.

interacting measure-valued random processes which describes a large population

resampling on all hierarchical scales simultaneously. Upon resampling, a random
positive fraction of the population in a block of colonies inherits the type of
a random single individual in that block, which is why we refer to our system
as the hierarchical Cannings process.
  In the present paper, we study a version of the hierarchical Cannings process
in random environment, namely, the resampling measures controlling the change
of type of individuals in different blocks are chosen randomly with a given
mean and are kept fixed in time (= the quenched setting). We give a necessary
and sufficient condition under which a multi-type equilibrium is approached (=
coexistence) as opposed to a mono-type equilibrium (= clustering). Moreover, in
the hierarchical mean-field limit $N \to \infty$, with the help of a
renormalization analysis, we obtain a full picture of the space-time scaling
behaviour of block averages on all hierarchical scales simultaneously. We show
that the $k$-block averages are distributed as the superposition of a
Fleming-Viot diffusion with a deterministic volatility constant $d_k$ and a
Cannings process with a random jump rate, both depending on $k$. In the random
environment, $d_k$ turns out to be smaller than in the homogeneous environment
of the same mean. We investigate how $d_k$ scales with $k$. This leads to five
universality classes of cluster formation in the mono-type regime. We find that
if clustering occurs, then the random environment slows down the growth of the
clusters, i.e., enhances the diversity of types.

evaluate the minima of the normalized forms of both the product and sum of such
variances, as well as that of a regularized sum. Making use of Simon's
separability criterion, which is based on the condition of positivity of the
partial transpose (PPT) of the density matrix [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84}, 2726

right. They appear to quantify the greatest amount of EPR-like correlations
that can be created in a two-mode Gaussian state by means of local operations.
Furthermore, we reconsider the EPR-like approach to the separability of
two-mode Gaussian states which was developed by Duan {\em et al.} with no
reference to the PPT condition. By optimizing the regularized form of their
EPR-like uncertainty sum, we derive a separability indicator for any two-mode
Gaussian state. We prove that the corresponding EPR-like condition of
separability is manifestly equivalent to Simon's PPT one. The consistency of
these two distinct approaches (EPR-like and PPT) affords a better understanding
of the examined separability problem, whose explicit solution found long ago by
Simon covers all situations of interest.

the required pressure for metallization was far greater, in the 400-500 GPa
range. Until now the observation of the WE transition in diamond anvil cells
(DACs) has been prevented by one problem: the diamonds break before a
sufficiently high pressure has been achieved. This has driven the high-pressure
community to improve DACs and experimental methods to understand and overcome
the conditions that limited the performance of diamonds and the pressure. In
our experiment, with increasing pressure, we observed a clear transition from a
transparent sample of solid molecular hydrogen to an opaque black sample to a
shiny reflective sample of MH, as determined by reflectance measurements. There
is no doubt that MH was produced at the highest pressures. Yet there have been

parsed into small dictionaries of stereotyped behavioral modes, studies of
collective behavior largely ignored these findings; instead, their focus was on
inferring single, mode-independent social interaction rules that reproduced
macroscopic and often qualitative features of group behavior. Here we bring
these two approaches together to predict individual swimming patterns of adult
zebrafish in a group. We show that fish alternate between an active mode in
which they are sensitive to the swimming patterns of conspecifics, and a
passive mode where they ignore them. Using a model that accounts for these two
modes explicitly, we predict behaviors of individual fish with high accuracy,
outperforming previous approaches that assumed a single continuous computation
by individuals and simple metric or topological weighing of neighbors behavior.
At the group level, switching between active and passive modes is uncorrelated
among fish, yet correlated directional swimming behavior still emerges. Our
quantitative approach for studying complex, multi-modal individual behavior
jointly with emergent group behavior is readily extensible to additional
behavioral modes and their neural correlates, as well as to other species.

in 123-type iron chalcogenides. This material is the first reported iron-based
two-leg ladder superconductor, as opposed to the prevailing two-dimensional
layered structures of the iron superconductors family. Once the hydrostatic
pressure exceeds $11$ GPa, BaFe$_2$S$_3$ changes from a semiconductor to a
superconductor below $24$~K. Although previous calculations correctly explained
its ground state magnetic state and electronic structure, the pressure induced
phase transition was not successfully reproduced. In this work, our first
principles calculations find that with increasing pressure the lattice
constants as well as local magnetic moments are gradually suppressed, followed
by a first-order magnetic transition at a critical pressure, with local
magnetic moments dropping to zero suddenly. Our calculations suggests that the
self-doping caused by electrons transferred from S to Fe may play a key role in
this transition. The development of a nonmagnetic metallic phase at high
pressure may pave the way to superconductivity. As extensions of this effort,
two other 123-type iron chalcogenides, KFe$_2$S$_3$ and KFe$_2$Se$_3$, have
also been investigated. KFe$_2$S$_3$ also displays a first-order transition
with increasing pressure, but KFe$_2$Se$_3$ shows instead a second-order, or
weakly first-order, transition. The required pressures for KFe$_2$S$_3$ and
KFe$_2$Se$_3$ to quench the magnetism are higher than for BaFe$_2$S$_3$.
Further experiments can confirm the predicted first-order nature of the
transition in BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and KFe$_2$S$_3$, as well as the possible

pairs of algebras. The notion of B-$(\ell, r)$-cumulants is defined via a
bi-Boolean moment-cumulant formula over the lattice of bi-interval partitions,
and it is demonstrated that bi-Boolean independence is equivalent to the
vanishing of mixed B-$(\ell, r)$-cumulants. Furthermore, some of the simplest
bi-Boolean convolutions are considered, and a bi-Boolean partial
$\eta$-transform is constructed for the study of limit theorems and infinite
divisibility with respect to the additive bi-Boolean convolution. In
particular, a bi-Boolean L\'{e}vy-Hin\v{c}in formula is derived in perfect
analogy with the bi-free case, and some Bercovici-Pata type bijections are
provided. Additional topics considered include the additive bi-Fermi

of memory and computation, which limits its deployment on embedded devices. To
alleviate these problems to some extent, prior research utilize low precision
fixed-point numbers to represent the CNN weights and activations. However, the
minimum required data precision of fixed-point weights varies across different

propose using floating-point numbers for representing the weights and
fixed-point numbers for representing the activations. We show that using
floating-point representation for weights is more efficient than fixed-point
representation for the same bit-width and demonstrate it on popular large-scale
CNNs such as AlexNet, SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet and VGG-16. We also show that such
a representation scheme enables compact hardware multiply-and-accumulate (MAC)

weight storage by up to 36% and power consumption of the hardware multiplier by
up to 50%.

phases to non-Hermitian systems, a finite system in a non-trivial topological
phase displays surface states with exponentially long life times. In this work
we explore the possibility of exploiting such non-Hermitian topological phases
to enhance the quantum coherence of a fiducial qubit embedded in a dissipative
environment. We first show that a network of qubits interacting with lossy
cavities can be represented, in a suitable super-one-particle sector, by a
non-Hermitian ""Hamiltonian"" of the desired form. We then study, both
analytically and numerically, one-dimensional geometries with up to three sites
per unit cell, and up to a topological winding number $W=2$. For finite-size
systems the number of edge modes is a complicated function of $W$ and the
system size $N$. However we find that there are precisely $W$ modes localized
at one end of the chain. In such topological phases the quibt's coherence
lifetime is exponentially large in the system size. We verify that, for $W>1$,
at large times, the Lindbladian evolution is approximately a non-trivial
unitary. For $W=2$ this results in Rabi-like oscillations of the qubit's
coherence measure.

media that may result from mass-loss enhancement of the progenitors shortly
before their explosions. Previous light-curve studies suggest that the
mass-loss rates are enhanced up to ~ 0.1 Msun/yr, assuming a constant wind
velocity. However, density of circumstellar media at the immediate stellar
vicinity can be much higher than previously inferred for a given mass-loss rate
if wind acceleration is taken into account. We show that the wind acceleration
has a huge impact when we estimate mass-loss rates from early light curves of
Type IIP supernovae by taking SN 2013fs as an example. We perform numerical
calculations of the interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar
media with a constant mass-loss rate but with a beta-law wind velocity profile.
We find that the mass-loss rate of the progenitor of SN 2013fs shortly before
the explosion, which was inferred to be ~ 0.1 Msun/yr with a constant wind
velocity of 10 km/s by a previous light-curve modeling, can be as low as ~ 1e-3
Msun/yr with the same terminal wind velocity of 10 km/s but with a wind
velocity profile with beta ~ 5. In both cases, the mass of the circumstellar
medium is similar (~ 0.5 Msun). Therefore, the beginning of the progenitor's
mass-loss enhancement in our interpretation is ~ 100 years before the
explosion, not several years. Our result indicates that the immediate dense
environment of Type II supernova progenitors may be significantly influenced by
wind acceleration.

boulders by modeling their response to diurnal thermal forcing. Our results
reveal a bimodal, spatiotemporally-complex stress response. During sunrise,
stresses occur in the boulders' interiors that are associated with large-scale
temperature gradients developed due to overnight cooling. During sunset,
stresses occur at the boulders' exteriors due to the cooling and contraction of
the surface. Both kinds of stresses are on the order of 10 MPa in 1 m boulders
and decrease for smaller diameters, suggesting that larger boulders break down
more quickly. Boulders <30 cm exhibit a weak response to thermal forcing,
suggesting a threshold below which crack propagation may not occur. Boulders of
any size buried by regolith are shielded from thermal breakdown. As boulders
increase in size (>1 m), stresses increase to several 10s of MPa as the
behavior of their surfaces approaches that of an infinite halfspace. As the
thermal wave loses contact with the boulder interior, stresses become limited
to the near-surface. This suggests that the survival time of a boulder is not
only controlled by the amplitude of induced stress, but also by its diameter as
compared to the diurnal skin depth. While stresses on the order of 10 MPa are
enough to drive crack propagation in terrestrial environments, crack
propagation rates in vacuum are not well constrained. We explore the
relationship between boulder size, stress, and the direction of crack
propagation, and discuss the implications for the relative breakdown rates and
estimated lifetimes of boulders on airless body surfaces.

common to use an advection-dispersion equation (ADE) with a retardation factor,
or retarded ADE. This is commonly referred to as making the local equilibrium
assumption. Assuming local equilibrium (LE), Eulerian textbook treatments
derive the retarded ADE, ostensibly exactly. However, other authors have
presented rigorous mathematical derivations of the dispersive effect of mass
transfer, applicable even in the case of arbitrarily fast mass transfer. First,
we resolve the apparent contradiction between these seemingly exact derivations
by adopting a Lagrangian point of view. We show that LE constrains the expected
time immobile, whereas the retarded ADE actually embeds a stronger,
nonphysical, constraint: that all particles spend the same amount of every time
increment immobile. Eulerian derivations of the retarded ADE thus silently
commit the gambler's fallacy, leading them to ignore dispersion due to mass
transfer that is correctly modeled by other approaches. Second, we present a
numerical particle tracking study of transport in a heterogeneous aquifer
subject to first-order MIMT. Transport is modeled (a) exactly, and then (b)
approximated with the retarded ADE. Strikingly different results are obtained,
even though quasi-LE is maintained at all times by the exact MIMT simulation.
We thus observe that use of the phrase local equilibrium assumption to refer to
ADE validity is not correct. We highlight that solute remobilization rate is
the true control on retarded ADE validity, and note that classic ""local
equilibrium assumption"" (i.e., ADE validity) criteria actually test for
insignificance of MIMT-driven dispersion relative to hydrodynamic dispersion,
rather than for local equilibrium.

systematic biases which cannot be encapsulated by an unbiased ""observation

Bayesian formulations. Despite its importance, model error is difficult to
encapsulate systematically and is often neglected. Here, model error is
considered for a hydrogeologically important class of inverse problems that
includes interpretation of hydraulic transients and contaminant source history
inference: reconstruction of a time series that has been convolved against a
transfer function (i.e., impulse response) that is only approximately known.
Using established harmonic theory along with two results established here

derived for the effect of systematic model error on time series recovery for

Nonlinearity in the resonance behavior of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)
has only lately attracted significant interest. Most recently, cubic-order
nonlinearity has been used to explain anomalies in the resonance frequency
behaviors in the frequency domain. Particularly, such nonlinearities were
explained using cubic nonlinearity in the restoring force (Duffing
nonlinearity) or damping (van der Pol nonlinearity). Understanding the limits
of linear resonant behavior is particularly important in NEMS, as they are
frequently studied for their potential in ultrasensitive sensing and detection,
applications that most commonly assume a linear behavior to transduce motion
into a detected signal. In this paper, we report that even at low excitation,
cubic nonlinearity is insufficient to explain nonlinearity in graphene NEMS.
Rather, we observe that higher order, in particular, the fifth order effects
need to be considered even for systems at room temperature with modest quality
factors. These are particularly important results that could determine the
limits of linear detection in such systems and quite possibly present
unconventional avenues for ultrasensitive detection paradigms using nonlinear
dynamics. Such intriguing possibilities, however, hinge crucially on a superior
understanding and exploitation of these inherent nonlinearities as opposed to
modeling them as approximated linear or cubic systems.

tube-MPC and nominal robust MPC (NRMPC). In tube-MPC, the control signal
consists of a control action and a nonlinear feedback law based on the
deviation of the actual states from the states of a nominal system. It renders
the actual trajectory within a tube centered along the optimal trajectory of
the nominal system. Recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are
established and the constraints are ensured by tightening the input domain and
the terminal region. While in NRMPC, an optimal control sequence is obtained by
solving an optimization problem based on the current state, and the first
portion of this sequence is applied to the real system in an open-loop manner
during each sampling period. The state of nominal system model is updated by
the actual state at each step, which provides additional a feedback. By
introducing a robust state constraint and tightening the terminal region,
recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are guaranteed. Simulation

models have revealed an inner disk radius of $13.8_{-1.8}^{+3.0}\ R_{g}$ (where
$R_{g} = GM/c^{2}$) for the low flux spectrum and $23.4_{-5.4}^{+15.6}\ R_{g}$

truncated by a boundary layer surrounding the neutron star or the
magnetosphere. Based on the measured luminosity and using the accretion
efficiency for a disk around a neutron star, we estimate that the theoretically
expected size for the boundary layer would be $\sim0.9-1.1 \ R_{g}$ from the

recently led to the realisation of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), a
unique phase of quantum matter. These materials are of great interest, since
they may support electrical currents that flow without resistance via edge
channels, even at zero magnetic field. To date, the QAHE has been investigated
using low-frequency transport measurements. However, transport requires
contacting the sample and results can be difficult to interpret due to the
presence of parallel conductive paths, via either the bulk or surface, or
because additional non-chiral edge channels may exist. Here, we move beyond
transport measurements by probing the microwave response of a magnetised disk
of Cr-(Bi,Sb)2Te3. We identify features associated with chiral edge
magnetoplasmons (EMPs), a signature that robust edge-channels are indeed
intrinsic to this material system. Our results provide a measure of the

scalable. In big data settings, most literature focuses on reducing the
computing time per iteration, with less focused on reducing the number of
iterations needed in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This article focuses on
data augmentation MCMC (DA-MCMC), a widely used technique. DA-MCMC samples tend
to become highly autocorrelated in large data samples, due to a miscalibration
problem in which conditional posterior distributions given augmented data are
too concentrated. This makes it necessary to collect very long MCMC paths to
obtain acceptably low MC error. To combat this inefficiency, we propose a
family of calibrated data augmentation algorithms, which appropriately adjust
the variance of conditional posterior distributions. A Metropolis-Hastings step
is used to eliminate bias in the stationary distribution of the resulting
sampler. Compared to existing alternatives, this approach can dramatically
reduce MC error by reducing autocorrelation and increasing the effective number
of DA-MCMC samples per computing time. The approach is simple and applicable to
a broad variety of existing data augmentation algorithms, and we focus on three
popular models: probit, logistic and Poisson log-linear. Dramatic gains in
computational efficiency are shown in applications.

high-harmonic extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy and
ultrafast electron diffraction. XUV absorption from 45 eV to 62 eV measures
transitions from the iodine 4d core level to the conduction band density of
states. Photoexcitation at 400 nm creates separate and distinct transient
absorption signals for holes and electrons, separated in energy by the 2.4 eV
band gap of the semiconductor. The shape of the conduction band and therefore
the XUV absorption spectrum is temperature dependent, and nonradiative
recombination converts the initial electronic excitation to thermal excitation
within picoseconds. Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is used to measure the
lattice temperature and confirm the recombination mechanism. The XUV and UED
results support a 2nd-order recombination model with a rate constant of
2.5x10-9 cm3/s.

method for both classical and quantum systems. The algorithm substantially
alleviates critical slowing down and reduces the dynamic critical exponents of
various classical systems. It is crucial to improve the algorithm and push the
boundary of the Monte Carlo method for physical systems. We here propose a
directed worm algorithm that significantly improves computational efficiency.
We use the geometric allocation approach to optimize the worm scattering
process: worm backscattering is averted, and forward scattering is favored. Our
approach successfully enhances the diffusivity of the worm head (kink), which
is evident in the probability distribution of the relative position of the two
kinks. Performance improvement is demonstrated for the Ising model at the
critical temperature by measurement of exponential autocorrelation times and
asymptotic variances. The present worm update is approximately 25 times as
efficient as the conventional worm update for the simple cubic lattice model.
Surprisingly, our algorithm is even more efficient than the Wolff cluster
algorithm, which is one of the best update algorithms. We estimate the dynamic
critical exponent of the simple cubic lattice Ising model to be $z \approx
0.27$ in the worm update. The worm and the Wolff algorithms produce different
exponents of the integrated autocorrelation time of the magnetic susceptibility
estimator but the same exponent of the asymptotic variance. We also discuss how
to quantify the computational efficiency of the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of physical systems, such
as the $| \phi |^4$ model, the Potts model, the O($n$) loop model, and lattice
QCD.

turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) over rough plates with
pyramid-shaped and periodically distributed roughness elements. Using a
parameter $\lambda$ defined as the height of a roughness element over its base
width, the heat transport, the flow dynamics and local temperatures are
measured for the Rayleigh number range $7.50\times 10^{7} \leq Ra\leq
1.31\times 10^{11}$, and the Prandtl number $Pr$ from 3.57 to 23.34 at four
values of $\lambda$. It is found that the heat transport scaling, i.e. $Nu\sim
Ra^{\alpha}$ where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number, may be classified into three
regimes. In Regime I, the system is in a dynamically smooth state. The heat
transport scaling is the same as that in a smooth cell. In Regimes II and III,
the heat transport enhances. When $\lambda$ is increased from 0.5 to 4.0,
$\alpha$ increases from 0.36 to 0.59 in Regime II, and it increases from 0.30
to 0.50 in Regime III. The experiment demonstrates the heat transport scaling
in turbulent RBC can be manipulated using $\lambda$. Previous studies suggest
that the transition from Regime I to Regime II, occurs when the thermal
boundary layer (BL) thickness becomes smaller than the roughness height $h$.
Direct measurements of the viscous BL in the present study suggest that the
transition from Regime II to Regime III is likely a result of the viscous BL
thickness becoming smaller $h$. The scaling exponent of the Reynolds number
$Re$ vs. $Ra$ changes from 0.471 to 0.551 when $\lambda$ is increased from 0.5
to 4.0. It is also found that increasing $\lambda$ increases the clustering of
thermal plumes which effectively increases the plumes lifetime that are
ultimately responsible for the enhanced heat transport.

  We present ""InsideOut"", a dynamic programming algorithm, to evaluate an FAQ.
The algorithm rewrites the input query into a set of easier-to-compute FAQ
sub-queries. Each sub-query is then evaluated using a worst-case optimal
relational join algorithm. The topic of designing algorithms to optimally
evaluate the classic multiway join problem has seen exciting developments in
the past few years. Our framework tightly connects these new ideas in database
theory with a vast number of application areas in a coherent manner, showing
potentially that a good database engine can be a general-purpose constraint

Yet, in spite of solving an extremely general problem, its runtime either is as
good as or improves upon the best known algorithm for the applications that FAQ
specializes to. These corollaries include computational tasks in graphical
model inference, matrix/tensor operations, relational joins, and logic. Better
yet, InsideOut can be used within any database engine, because it is basically
a principled way of rewriting queries. Indeed, it is already part of the

sub-class of the general schemes we introduce a soliton orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (SOFDM) method. This method is based on the choice of
identical imaginary parts of the N-soliton solution eigenvalues, corresponding
to equidistant soliton frequencies making it similar to the conventional OFDM
scheme, thus, allowing use of the efficient fast Fourier transform algorithm to
recover the data. Then, we demonstrate how to use this new approach to control
signal parameters in the case of the continuous spectrum.

in many engineering, environmental, mining, and petroleum applications.
Microseismic signals recorded at the surface, suffer from excessive noise that
complicates first-break picking and subsequent data processing and analysis.
This study presents a new first-break picking algorithm that employs concepts
from seismic interferometry and time-frequency (TF) analysis. The algorithm
first uses a TF plot to manually pick a reference first-break and then iterates
the steps of cross-correlation, alignment, and stacking to enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio of the relative first breaks. The reference first-break
is subsequently used to calculate final first breaks from the relative ones.
Testing on synthetic and real data sets at high levels of additive noise shows
that the algorithm enhances the first-break picking considerably. Furthermore,
results show that only two iterations are needed to converge to the true first
breaks. Indeed, iterating more can have detrimental effects on the algorithm
due to increasing correlation of random noise.

the optimum of selection of genotypes that maximizes genetic gain. The key
constraint in the optimal selection is a convex quadratic constraint that
ensures genetic diversity, therefore, the optimal selection can be cast as a
second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Yamashita et al. (2015) exploits
the structural sparsity of the quadratic constraints and reduces the
computation time drastically while attaining the same optimal solution.
  This paper is concerned with the special case of equal deployment (ED), in
which we solve the optimal selection problem with the constraint that
contribution of genotypes must either be a fixed size or zero. This involves a
nature of combinatorial optimization, and the ED problem can be described as a
mixed-integer SOCP problem.
  In this paper, we discuss conic relaxation approaches for the ED problem
based on LP (linear programming), SOCP, and SDP (semidefinite programming). We
analyze theoretical bounds derivedfrom the SDP relaxation approaches using the
work of Tseng (2003) and show that the theoretical bounds are not quite sharp
for tree breeding problems. We propose a steepest-ascent method that combines
the solution obtained from the conic relaxation problems with a concept from
discrete convex optimization in order to acquire an approximate solution for
the ED problem in a practical time. From numerical tests, we observed that
among the LP, SOCP, and SDP relaxation problems, SOCP gave a suitable solution
from the viewpoints of the optimal values and the computation time. The
steepest-ascent method starting from the SOCP solution provides high-quality
solutions much faster than an existing method that has been widely used for the
optimal selection problems and a branch-and-bound method.

results of SED simulations for a system with a 0.8 $M_{\odot}$ central object

disc. We use a solution to the one-dimensional radiative transfer equation to
calculate the protoplanetary disc flux density and assume, that the companion
moves along a circular orbit and clears a gap. The width of the gap is assumed
to be the diameter of the brown dwarf Hill sphere. Our modelling shows that the
presence of such a gap can initiate an additional minimum in the SED profile of
a protoplanetary disc at $\lambda = 10 - 100$ $\mu$m. We show that the depth of
this minimum and the wavelength of the maximum difference between the SEDs of
the system with and without a companion are related to the companion mass and
its proximity to the star. We found that it is possible to detect signatures of
the companion when it is located within 10 AU, even when it is as small as 3
$M_J$. We also analyse how the disc parameters (the inner radius and the
temperature profile) change the maximum difference between the SEDs for the
same systems with and without a companion. The SED of a protostellar disc with
a massive fragment might have a similar double peaked profile to the SED of a
more evolved disc that contains a gap. However, in this case, it will be caused
by the presence of an additional maximum at shorter wavelengths and will be
similar only when the massive fragment is relatively cold ($\sim$400 K).

iron-based superconductors. Among these systems, the iron selenides hold the
record for highest superconducting transition temperature and pose especially
striking puzzles regarding the nature of superconductivity. The pairing state
of the alkaline iron selenides appears to be of $d$-wave type based on the
observation of a resonance mode in neutron scattering, while it seems to be of
$s$-wave type from the nodeless gaps observed everywhere on the Fermi surface
(FS). Here we propose an orbital-selective pairing state, dubbed $s \tau_{3}$,
as a natural explanation of these disparate properties. The pairing function,
containing a matrix $\tau_{3}$ in the basis of $3d$-electron orbitals, does not
commute with the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian. This dictates the existence
of both intraband and interband pairing terms in the band basis. A spin
resonance arises from a $d$-wave-type sign change in the intraband pairing
component whereas the quasiparticle excitation is fully gapped on the FS due to
an $s$-wave-like form factor associated with the addition in quadrature of the
intraband and interband pairing terms. We demonstrate that this pairing state
is energetically favored when the electron correlation effects are orbitally
selective. More generally, our results illustrate how the multiband nature of
correlated electrons affords unusual types of superconducting states, thereby
shedding new light not only on the iron-based materials but also on a broad
range of other unconventional superconductors such as heavy fermion and organic
systems.

traditional linear zero-forcing (ZF) precoder, we propose a generalized ZF
(GZF) precoder in conjunction with successive dirty-paper coding (DPC) for

stands for \lq{}dirty-paper\rq{}. The GZF-DP precoder is designed to generate a
band-shaped and lower-triangular effective channel $\vec{F}$ such that only the
entries along the main diagonal and the $\nu$ first lower-diagonals can take
non-zero values. Utilizing the successive DPC, the known non-causal inter-user
interferences from the other (up to) $\nu$ users are canceled through
successive encoding. We analyze optimal GZF-DP precoder designs both for
sum-rate and minimum user-rate maximizations. Utilizing Lagrange multipliers,
the optimal precoders for both cases are solved in closed-forms in relation to
optimal power allocations. For the sum-rate maximization, the optimal power
allocation can be found through water-filling, but with modified water-levels
depending on the parameter $\nu$. While for the minimum user-rate maximization
that measures the quality of the service (QoS), the optimal power allocation is
directly solved in closed-form which also depends on $\nu$. Moreover, we
propose two low-complexity user-ordering algorithms for the GZF-DP precoder
designs for both maximizations, respectively. We show through numerical results
that, the proposed GZF-DP precoder with a small $\nu$ ($\leq\!3$) renders
significant rate increments compared to the previous precoder designs such as
the linear ZF and user-grouping based DPC (UG-DP) precoders.

investigate the top-site adatom on trilayer graphene (TLG) by solving the
Anderson impurity model via self-consistent mean field method. The influence of
the stacking order, the adsorption site and external electric field are
carefully considered. We find that, due to its unique electronic structure, the
situation of the TLG is drastically different from that of the monolayer
graphene. Firstly, the adatom on rhombohedral stacked TLG (r-TLG) can have a
Fano-shaped impurity spectral density, instead of the normal Lorentzian-like
one, when the impurity level is around the Fermi level. Secondly, the impurity
level of the adatom on r-TLG can be tuned into an in-gap state by an external
electric field, which strongly depends on the direction of the applied electric
field and can significantly affect the local magnetic moment formation.
Finally, we systematically calculate the impurity magnetic phase diagrams,
considering various stacking orders, adsorption sites, doping and electric
field. We show that, because of the in-gap state, the impurity magnetic phase
of r-TLG will obviously depend on the direction of the applied electric field
as well. All our theoretical results can be readily tested in experiment, and
may give a comprehensive understanding about the local magnetic moment of
adatom on TLG.

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer(BCS) theory has a very peculiar prediction: at zero

penetration depth). Very recently, this prediction was challenged by directly
measuring the penetration depth upon doping in overdoped cuprates. (Bozovic et

is not right. The key point is to disentangle two fundamental concepts in
superconductors: plasma frequency and superfluid density, which were thought to
be equal for more than half a century. In our theory, superfluid density is
determined only by paired electrons while plasma frequency by all electrons. As
a consequence, the widely used technique to obtain superfluid density through
optical conductivity, based on Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule, measures only
plasma frequency but not superfluid density. Our theory has been evidenced by

  The cross section of 17O(p,g)18F is characterized by a complicated resonance
structure at low energies. Experimental data, however, is scarce in a wide
energy range which increases the uncertainty of the low energy extrapolations.
The purpose of the present work is therefore to provide consistent and precise
cross section values in a wide energy range.
  The cross section is measured using the activation method which provides
directly the total cross section. With this technique some typical systematic
uncertainties encountered in in-beam gamma-spectroscopy experiments can be
avoided.
  The cross section was measured between 500 keV and 1.8 MeV proton energies
with a total uncertainty of typically 10%. The results are compared with
earlier measurements and it is found that the gross features of the 17O(p,g)18F
excitation function is relatively well reproduced by the present data.
Deviation of roughly a factor of 1.5 is found in the case of the total cross
section when compared with the only one high energy dataset. At the lowest
measured energy our result is in agreement with two recent datasets within one
standard deviation and deviates by roughly two standard deviations from a third
one. An R-matrix analysis of the present and previous data strengthen the
reliability of the extrapolated zero energy astrophysical S-factor.
  Using an independent experimental technique, the literature cross section
data of 17O(p,g)18F is confirmed in the energy region of the resonances while
lower direct capture cross section is recommended at higher energies. The
present dataset provides a constraint for the theoretical cross sections.

Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) has led to a new paradigm for band structure
engineering with atomic precision. Due to the weak interlayer couplings, the
band structures of the individual 2D crystals are largely preserved upon
formation of the heterostructure. However, regardless of the details of the
interlayer hybridisation, the size of the 2D crystal band gaps are always
reduced due to the enhanced dielectric screening provided by the surrounding
layers. The effect can be on the order of electron volts, but its precise
magnitude is non-trivial to predict because of the non-local nature of the
screening in quasi-2D materials, and it is not captured by effective
single-particle methods such as density functional theory. Here we present an
efficient and general method for calculating the band gap renormalization of a
2D material embedded in an arbitrary vdWH. The method evaluates the change in
the GW self-energy of the 2D material from the change in the screened Coulomb
interaction. The latter is obtained using the quantum-electrostatic
heterostructure (QEH) model. We benchmark the G$\Delta$W method against full
first-principles GW calculations and use it to unravel the importance of
screening-induced band structure renormalisation in various vdWHs. A main
result is the observation that the size of the band gap reduction of a given 2D
material when inserted into a heterostructure scales inversely with the
polarisability of the 2D material. Our work demonstrates that dielectric
engineering \emph{via} van der Waals heterostructuring represents a promising
strategy for tailoring the band structure of 2D materials.

different contexts, showing that it plays a central role in highly dynamic
networks, although the problem is defined in terms of classical (static) graph
theory. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of {\em maximal independent
sets} (MIS). Following the above definition, a MIS is said to be {\em robust}
(RMIS) if it remains a valid MIS in all connected spanning subgraphs of the
original graph. We characterize the class of graphs in which {\em all} possible
MISs are robust. We show that, in these particular graphs, the problem of
finding a robust MIS is {\em local}; that is, we present an RMIS algorithm
using only a sublogarithmic number of rounds (in the number of nodes $n$) in
the ${\cal LOCAL}$ model. On the negative side, we show that, in general
graphs, the problem is not local. Precisely, we prove a $\Omega(n)$ lower bound
on the number of rounds required for the nodes to decide consistently in some
graphs. This result implies a separation between the RMIS problem and the MIS
problem in general graphs. It also implies that any strategy in this case is
asymptotically (in order) as bad as collecting all the network information at
one node and solving the problem in a centralized manner. Motivated by this
observation, we present a centralized algorithm that computes a robust MIS in a

Applying a non-axisymmetric external magnetic perturbation is one technique
that is studied in order to mitigate or suppress large edge localized modes
which accompany the high confinement regime in tokamaks. The external magnetic
perturbation brakes the axisymmetry of a tokamak and leads to a 2D heat flux
pattern on the divertor target. The 2D heat flux pattern at the outer divertor
target is studied on ASDEX Upgrade in stationary L-Mode discharges. The
amplitude of the 2D characteristic of the heat flux depends on the alignment
between the field lines at the edge and the vacuum response of the applied
magnetic perturbation spectrum. The 2D characteristic reduces with increasing
density. The increasing divertor broadening $S$ with increasing density is
proposed as the main actuator. This is supported by a generic model using field
line tracing and the vacuum field approach that is in quantitative agreement
with the measured heat flux. The perturbed heat flux, averaged over a full
toroidal rotation of the magnetic perturbation, is identical to the
non-perturbed heat flux without magnetic perturbation. The transport
qualifiers, power fall-off length $\lambda_q$ and divertor broadening $S$, are
the same within the uncertainty compared to the unperturbed reference. No
additional cross field transport is observed.

semantics in logic. We embed a finite model M in first-order logic with N
entities in N-dimensional Euclidean space R^N by mapping entities of M to N
dimensional one-hot vectors and k-ary relations to order-k adjacency tensors
(multi-way arrays). Second given a logical formula F in prenex normal form, we
compile F into a set Sigma_F of algebraic formulas in multi-linear algebra with
a nonlinear operation. In this compilation, existential quantifiers are
compiled into a specific type of tensors, e.g., identity matrices in the case
of quantifying two occurrences of a variable. It is shown that a systematic
evaluation of Sigma_F in R^N gives the truth value, 1(true) or 0(false), of F
in M. Based on this framework, we also propose an unprecedented way of
computing the least models defined by Datalog programs in linear spaces via
matrix equations and empirically show its effectiveness compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

crystallization annealing. Increasing the boron content from 20 to 30\%
increases the crystallization temperature, thereby postponing the onset of
elemental diffusion within the free layer. This reduction of the interdiffusion
of the Ta atoms helps maintaining the Gilbert damping at a low level of 0.009
without any penalty on the anisotropy and the magneto-transport properties up
to the 400$^\circ$C annealing required in CMOS back-end of line processing. In
addition, we show that dual MgO free layers of composition
MgO/FeCoB/Ta/FeCoB/MgO have a substantially lower damping than their
MgO/FeCoB/Ta counterparts, reaching damping parameters as low as 0.0039 for a 3
\r{A} thick Tantalum spacer. This confirms that the dominant channel of damping
is the presence of Ta impurities within the FeCoB alloy. On optimized tunnel
junctions, we then study the duration of the switching events induced by
spin-transfer-torque. We focus on the sub-threshold thermally activated
switching in optimal applied field conditions. From the electrical signatures
of the switching, we infer that once the nucleation has occurred, the reversal
proceeds by a domain wall sweeping though the device at a few 10 m/s. The
smaller the device, the faster its switching. We present an analytical model to
account for our findings. The domain wall velocity is predicted to scale
linearly with the current for devices much larger than the wall width. The wall
velocity depends on the Bloch domain wall width, such that the devices with the
lowest exchange stiffness will be the ones that host the domain walls with the
slowest mobilities.

The research on computer-aided design software for dental splints is rarely
reported. Our purpose is to develop a novel special software named EasySplint
to design the dental splints conveniently and efficiently. The design can be
divided into two steps, which are the generation of initial splint base and the
Boolean operation between it and the maxilla-mandibular model. The initial
splint base is formed by ruled surfaces reconstructed using the manually picked
points. Then, a method to accomplish Boolean operation based on the distance
filed of two meshes is proposed. The interference elimination can be conducted
on the basis of marching cubes algorithm and Boolean operation. The accuracy of
the dental splint can be guaranteed since the original mesh is utilized to form
the result surface. Using EasySplint, the dental splints can be designed in
about 10 minutes and saved as a stereo lithography (STL) file for 3D printing
in clinical applications. Three phantom experiments were conducted and the
efficiency of our method was demonstrated.

recognizable features in their spectra (no emission and Hd in absorption) and
are called post starburst (PSB) galaxies. By studying their stellar population
properties and their location within the clusters, we obtain valuable insights
on the physical processes responsible for star formation quenching. We present
the first complete characterization of PSB galaxies in clusters at 0.04 < z <
0.07, based on WINGS and OmegaWINGS data, and contrast their properties to
those of passive (PAS) and emission line (EML) galaxies. For V < 20, PSBs
represent 7.2 +/- 0.2% of cluster galaxies within 1.2 virial radii. Their
incidence slightly increases from the outskirts toward the cluster center and
from the least toward the most luminous and massive clusters, defined in terms
of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The phase-space analysis and
velocity dispersion profile suggest that PSBs represent a combination of
galaxies with different accretion histories. Moreover, PSBs with the strongest
Hd are consistent with being recently accreted. PSBs have stellar masses,
magnitudes, colors and morphologies intermediate between PAS and EML galaxies,
typical of a population in transition from being star forming to passive.
Comparing the fraction of PSBs to the fraction of galaxies in transition on
longer timescales, we estimate that the short timescale star-formation
quenching channel contributes two times more than the long timescale one to the
growth of the passive population. Processes like ram-pressure stripping and
galaxy-galaxy interactions are more efficient than strangulation in affecting
star formation.

are stabilized at high temperatures by the magnetic entropy even at pressures

calculate the free energy of systems with strongly anharmonic atomic

method to study, from first-principles, the anharmonic properties of solids.
The free energy as a function of average atomic positions (centroids) can be
used to study quantum or thermal lattice instability. In particular the
centroids are order parameters in second-order structural phase transitions
such as, e.g., charge-density-waves or ferroelectric instabilities. According
to Landau's theory, the knowledge of the second derivative of the free energy
(i.e. the curvature) with respect to the centroids in a high-symmetry
configuration allows the identification of the phase-transition and of the
instability modes. In this work we derive the exact analytic formula for the
second derivative of the free energy in the self-consistent harmonic
approximation for a generic atomic configuration. The analytic derivative is
expressed in terms of the atomic displacements and forces in a form that can be
evaluated by a stochastic technique using importance sampling. Our approach is
particularly suitable for applications based on first-principles
density-functional-theory calculations, where the forces on atoms can be
obtained with a negligible computational effort compared to total energy
determination. Finally we propose a dynamical extension of the theory to
calculate spectral properties of strongly anharmonic phonons, as probed by
inelastic scattering processes. We illustrate our method with a numerical
application on a toy model that mimics the ferroelectric transition in
rock-salt crystals such as SnTe or GeTe.

predict a remarkable change of the electronic structure of FeSe which is
accompanied by a complete reconstruction of the Fermi surface topology
(Lifshitz transition) upon a moderate expansion of the lattice volume. The
phase transition results in a change of the in-plane magnetic nesting wave
vector from $(\pi,\pi)$ to $(\pi,0)$ and is associated with a transition from
itinerant to orbital-selective localized magnetic moments. We attribute this
behavior to a correlation-induced shift of the van Hove singularity of the Fe
$t_{2}$ bands at the M-point across the Fermi level. Our results reveal a
strong orbital-selective renormalization of the effective mass $m^*/m$ of the
Fe $3d$ electrons upon expansion. The largest effect occurs in the Fe $xy$
orbital, which gives rise to a non-Fermi-liquid-like behavior above the
transition. The behavior of the momentum-resolved magnetic susceptibility
$\chi({\bf q})$ demonstrates that magnetic correlations are also characterized
by a pronounced orbital selectivity, suggesting a spin-fluctuation origin of
the nematic phase of paramagnetic FeSe. We conjecture that the anomalous
behavior of FeSe upon expansion is associated with the proximity of the Fe
$t_{2}$ van Hove singularity to the Fermi level and the sensitive dependence of
its position on external conditions.

important in the subsequent evolution of the components. Such exchanges produce
several observational signatures such as asynchronous rotation and altered
chemical compositions, that remain after the stars detach again. We
investigated these effects for the close O-star binary LSS 3074 (O4 f + O6-7
:(f):), which is a good candidate for a past Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) episode
because of its very short orbital period, P = 2.185 days, and the luminosity
classes of both components. We determined a new orbital solution for the
system. We studied the photometric light curves to determine the inclination of
the orbit and Roche lobe filling factors of both stars. Using phase-resolved
spectroscopy, we performed the disentangling of the optical spectra of the two
stars. We then analysed the reconstructed primary and secondary spectra with
the CMFGEN model atmosphere code to determine stellar parameters, such as the
effective temperatures and surface gravities, and to constrain the chemical
composition of the components. We confirm the apparent low stellar masses and
radii reported in previous studies. We also find a strong overabundance in
nitrogen and a strong carbon and oxygen depletion in both primary and secondary
atmospheres, together with a strong enrichment in helium of the primary star.
We propose several possible evolutionary pathways through a RLOF process to
explain the current parameters of the system. We confirm that the system is
apparently in overcontact configuration and has lost a significant portion of
its mass to its surroundings. We suggest that some of the discrepancies between
the spectroscopic and photometric properties of LSS 3074 could stem from the

be envy-proof if each player cannot gain a competitive edge with respect to the
change in utility over the other players by deviation. Together with Nash
equilibrium and another stability notion called immunity, we show how these

considered, with spins located in the nodes and edges corresponding to
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions between them. Critical
temperatures for the spin glass and ferromagnetic transitions are evaluated for
the layers in the form of random Erd\""os-R\'enyi graphs or heterogeneous
scale-free networks using the replica method, from the replica symmetric
solution. For the Ising model on multiplex networks with scale-free layers it
is shown that the critical temperature is finite if the distributions of the
degrees of nodes within both layers have a finite second moment, and that
depending on the model parameters the transition can be to the ferromagnetic or
spin glass phase. It is also shown that the correlation between the degrees of
nodes within different layers significantly influences the critical
temperatures for both transitions and thus the phase diagram. The scaling
behavior for the spin glass order parameter is determined by a semi-analytic
procedure and it is shown that for the Ising model on multiplex networks with

Abelian gauge groups. In this paper, we investigate the gauge kinetic mixing in
the framework of $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM. It enlarges the viable
parameter space, and has an important effect on the particle mass spectrum as
well as the $Z_2$ coupling with matters. The SM-like Higgs boson mass can be
enhanced with a nonzero kinetic mixing parameter and the muon $g-2$ tension is
slightly less severe than in the case of no mixing. We present the results from
both benchmark analysis and global parameter scan. Various theoretical and
phenomenological constraints have been considered. The recent LHC searches for
the $Z_2$ boson are important for the case of large positive kinetic mixing
where the $Z_2$ coupling is enhanced, and severely constrain scenarios with
$M_{Z_2} < 2.8$ TeV. The viable dark matter candidate predicted by the model is
either the neutralino or the right-handed sneutrino. Cosmological constraints
from dark matter searches play a significant role in excluding the parameter
space. Portions of the parameter space with relatively low sparticle mass
spectrum can be successfully explored in the LHC run-2 as well as future linear
colliders and dark matter searches.

We have measured the full three-dimensional photoelectron momentum
distributions (3D PMDs) with velocity map imaging and tomographic
reconstruction. The ellipticity-dependent 3D-PMD measurements revealed an
unexpected sharp, thin line-shaped ridge structure in the polarization plane
for low momentum photoelectrons. With classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC)
simulations and analytical methods we identified the associated ionization
dynamics for this sharp ridge to be due to Coulomb focusing of slow
recollisions of electrons with a momentum approaching zero. This ridge is
another example of the many different ways how the Coulomb field of the parent
ion influences the different parts of the momentum space of the ionized
electron wave packet. Building on this new understanding of the PMD, we extend
our studies on the role played by the magnetic field component of the laser
beam when operating beyond the long-wavelength limit of the dipole
approximation. In this regime, we find that the PMD exhibits an
ellipticity-dependent asymmetry along the beam propagation direction: the peak
of the projection of the PMD onto the beam propagation axis is shifted from
negative to positive values with increasing ellipticity. This turnover occurs
rapidly once the ellipticity exceeds $\sim$0.1. We identify the sharp, thin
line-shaped ridge structure in the polarization plane as the origin of the
ellipticity-dependent PMD asymmetry in the beam propagation direction. These
results yield fundamental insights into strong-field ionization processes, and
should increase the precision of the emerging applications relying on this
technique, including time-resolved holography and molecular imaging.

advances in semantic segmentation. Here, we tackle this problem by leveraging
the respective strengths of these advances. That is, we formulate a conditional
random field over a four-connected graph as end-to-end trainable convolutional

Importantly, our model learns not only unary potentials but also pairwise
potentials, while aggregating multi-scale contexts and controlling higher-order

exchanges during 2016. This report describes the proceedings and outcomes of
the team's efforts.
  Many of the defensive activities in the fields of cyber warfare and
information assurance rely on essentially ad hoc techniques. The cyber
community recognizes that comprehensive, systematic, principle-based modeling
and simulation are more likely to produce long-term, lasting, reusable
approaches to defensive cyber operations.
  A model-driven paradigm is predicated on creation and validation of
mechanisms of modeling the organization whose mission is subject to assessment,
the mission (or missions) itself, and the cyber-vulnerable systems that support
the mission. This by any definition is a complex socio-technical system (of
systems), and the level of detail of this class of problems ranges from the
level of host and network events to the systems' functions up to the function
of the enterprise. Solving this class of problems is of medium to high
difficulty and can draw in part on advances in Systems Engineering (SE). Such
model-based approaches and analysis could be used to explore multiple
alternative mitigation and work-around strategies and to select the optimal
course of mitigating actions. Furthermore, the model-driven paradigm applied to
cyber operations is likely to benefit traditional disciplines of cyber defense
such as security, vulnerability analysis, intrusion prevention, intrusion
detection, analysis, forensics, attribution, and recovery.

mass, we must first accept that gravity is described by a gravitomagnetic
theory just like the electromagnetic theory with the gravitational mass as a
Lorentz invariant, and secondly the fundamental idea of the relativity of all
kinds of motion. By doing this we can prove that:
  1. The external inertial forces, felt by an accelerating body, are inductive
effects of the entire Universe while the internal inertial forces depend on the
internal structure of the body. When a body moves freely in a gravitational
field, its internal structure plays no role and the body feels only the
external inertial forces. That is why all bodies fall at the same rate in a
gravitational field.
  2. The inertial rest mass of a body depends on the distribution of the matter
in the Universe and this seems very important for dark matter and dark energy.
The inertial mass of a charged particle depends on the distribution of the
other charges in its neighborhood and this effect turns out to be important in
the subatomic world.
  3. The gravitational field affects the geometry of space-time which is a
Finsler-Randers space-time and all the freely moving bodies in a gravitational
field follow geodesics of this space-time.

challenge to identify cancer genes among the large lists of mutations typically
generated in NGS experiments. The ability to prioritize these variants is
therefore of paramount importance. To address this issue we developed
OncoScore, a text-mining tool that ranks genes according to their association
with cancer, based on available biomedical literature. Receiver operating
characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) metrics on manually
curated datasets confirmed the excellent discriminating capability of OncoScore
(OncoScore cut-off threshold = 21.09; AUC = 90.3%, 95% CI: 88.1-92.5%),
indicating that OncoScore provides useful results in cases where an efficient
prioritization of cancer-associated genes is needed.
