An exact transparent boundary condition (TBC) is developed to reduce the
problem equivalently into a boundary value problem in a bounded domain. The
perfectly matched layer (PML) technique is adopted to truncate the unbounded
physical domain into a bounded computational domain. The well-posedness and
exponential convergence of the solution are established for the truncated PML
problem by using a PML equivalent TBC. An a posteriori error estimate based
adaptive finite element method is developed to solve the scattering problem.

during the first ~2 weeks of the nova's evolution. The radio spectral energy
distribution was consistent with thermal emission from week 2 to week 6.
Starting in week 7, the radio emission again showed evidence of synchrotron
emission and there was an increase in X-ray emission, indicating a second shock
event. The optical spectra show evidence for at least two separate outflows,
with the faster outflow possibly having a bipolar morphology. The optical and
near infrared light curves and the X-ray measurements of the hydrogen column

general recommendation is to take $1/n$ as mutation rate. In this work, we
discuss whether this is really justified for multimodal functions. Taking jump
functions and the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm as the simplest example, we
observe that larger mutation rates give significantly better runtimes. For the
$\jump_{m,n}$ function, any mutation rate between $2/n$ and $m/n$ leads to a
speed-up at least exponential in $m$ compared to the standard choice.
  The asymptotically best runtime, obtained from using the mutation rate $m/n$
and leading to a speed-up super-exponential in $m$, is very sensitive to small
changes of the mutation rate. Any deviation by a small $(1 \pm \eps)$ factor
leads to a slow-down exponential in $m$. Consequently, any fixed mutation rate
gives strongly sub-optimal results for most jump functions.
  Building on this observation, we propose to use a random mutation rate
$\alpha/n$, where $\alpha$ is chosen from a power-law distribution. We prove
that the $(1+1)$ EA with this heavy-tailed mutation rate optimizes any
$\jump_{m,n}$ function in a time that is only a small polynomial (in~$m$)
factor above the one stemming from the optimal rate for this $m$.
  Our heavy-tailed mutation operator yields similar speed-ups (over the best
known performance guarantees) for the vertex cover problem in bipartite graphs
and the matching problem in general graphs.
  Following the example of fast simulated annealing, fast evolution strategies,

a heavy-tailed mutation operator \emph{fast genetic algorithms}.

covariance estimators lead to biased estimates of the covariance, due to
underestimating the super-sample covariance (SSC). This includes the jackknife
and bootstrap methods as estimators for the full survey area, and subsampling
as an estimator of the covariance of subsamples. The limitations of the
jackknife covariance have been previously presented in the literature because
it is effectively a rescaling of the covariance of the subsample area. However
we point out that subsampling is also biased, but for a different reason: the
subsamples are not independent, and the corresponding lack of power results in
SSC underprediction. We develop the formalism in the case of cluster counts
that allows the bias of each covariance estimator to be exactly predicted. We
find significant effects for a small-scale area or when a low number of
subsamples is used, with auto-redshift biases ranging from 0.4% to 15% for
subsampling and from 5% to 75% for jackknife covariance estimates. The
cross-redshift covariance is even more affected; biases range from 8% to 25%
for subsampling and from 50% to 90% for jackknife. Owing to the redshift
evolution of the probe, the covariances cannot be debiased by a simple
rescaling factor, and an exact debiasing has the same requirements as the full
SSC prediction. These results thus disfavour the use of internal covariance
estimators on data itself or a single simulation, leaving analytical prediction
and simulations suites as possible SSC predictors.

a more powerful wireless device with a buffer and multiple antennas, while a
set of intermediate less powerful devices are used as relays to reach the
destination. The main target is to recover the multiplexing loss of the network
by having the source and a relay to simultaneously transmit their information
to another relay and the destination, respectively. Successive transmissions in
such a cooperative network, however, cause inter-relay interference (IRI).
First, by assuming global channel state information (CSI), we show that the
detrimental effect of IRI can be alleviated by precoding at the source,
mitigating or even fully cancelling the interference. A cooperative relaying
policy is proposed that employs a joint precoding design and relay-pair
selection. Note that both fixed rate and adaptive rate transmissions can be
considered. For the case when channel state information is only available at
the receiver side (CSIR), we propose a relay selection policy that employs a
phase alignment technique to reduce the IRI. The performance of the two
proposed relay pair selection policies are evaluated and compared with other
state-of-the-art relaying schemes in terms of outage and throughput. The
results show that the use of a powerful source can provide considerable
performance improvements.

$\sim 8$ eV, while higher $T$ can be addressed ${\it via}$ the NPA. The
high-$T_e$ phonon calculations raise the question of UFM lattice stability and
surface ablation in thin UFM samples. The ablation forces in a UFM slab are
used to define an ""ablation time"" competing with phonon formation times in thin
UFM samples. Excellent agreement for all properties is found between NPA and
standard DFT codes, even for Li where a strongly non-local pseudopotential is
used in DFT codes. The need to use pseudopotentials appropriate to the

$\Gamma$ as an index $n$ subgroup, so that $f$ is induced by the inclusion of
$\Gamma <G$. The uniformization is uniquely determined by $(S,f)$, up to
conjugation by holomorphic automorphisms of ${\mathbb D}$, and it permits to
provide natural complex orbifold structures on the Hurwitz spaces parametrizing
(twisted) isomorphic classes of pairs topologically equivalent to $(S,f)$. In
order to produce certain compactifications of these Hurwitz spaces, one needs
to consider the so called stable $(\gamma,n)$-gonal pairs, which are natural
geometrical deformations of $(\gamma,n)$-gonal pairs. Due to the above, it
seems interesting to search for uniformizations of stable $(\gamma,n)$-gonal
pairs, in terms of certain class of Kleinian groups. In this paper we review
such uniformizations by using noded Fuchsian groups, which are (geometric)
limits of quasiconformal deformations of Fuchsian groups, and which provide
uniformizations of stable Riemann orbifolds. These uniformizations permit to
obtain a compactification of the Hurwitz spaces with a complex orbifold

over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation
process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing

smaller groups or isolated galaxies. During the infall into the centre of a
cluster, the properties of accreted galaxies change. In particular, both
observations and numerical simulations suggest that its dark matter halo is
stripped by the tidal forces of the host.
  We use galaxy-galaxy weak lensing to measure the average mass of dark matter
haloes of satellite galaxies as a function of projected distance to the centre
of the host, for different stellar mass bins. Assuming that the stellar
component of the galaxy is less disrupted by tidal stripping, stellar mass can
be used as a proxy of the infall mass. We study the stellar to halo mass
relation of satellites as a function of the cluster-centric distance to measure
tidal stripping.
  We use the shear catalogues of the DES science verification archive, the
CFHTLenS and the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) surveys, and we select satellites from
the redMaPPer catalogue of clusters. For galaxies located in the outskirts of
clusters, we find a stellar to halo mass relation in good agreement with the
theoretical expectations from \citet{moster2013} for central galaxies. In the
centre of the cluster, we find that this relation is shifted to smaller halo
mass for a given stellar mass. We interpret this finding as further evidence

A15 and fcc forms of Cs$_3$C$_{60}$ exhibit superconducting states varying
under hydrostatic pressure with highest transition temperatures at $T_\textrm
{C}$$^\textrm {meas}$ = 38.3 and 35.2 K, respectively. Herein it is argued that
these two compounds under pressure represent the optimal materials of the
$\textit {A}$$_3$C$_{60}$ family, and that the C$_{60}$-associated
superconductivity is mediated through Coulombic interactions with charges on
the alkalis. A derivation of the interlayer Coulombic pairing model of
high-$T_\textrm {C}$ superconductivity employing non-planar geometry is
introduced, generalizing the picture of two interacting layers to an
interaction between charge reservoirs located on the C$_{60}$ and alkali ions.
The optimal transition temperature follows the algebraic expression, $T_\textrm
{C0}$ = (12.474 nm$^2$ K)/$\ell$${\zeta}$, where $\ell$ relates to the mean
spacing between interacting surface charges on the C$_{60}$ and ${\zeta}$ is
the average radial distance between the C$_{60}$ surface and the neighboring Cs
ions. Values of $T_\textrm {C0}$ for the measured cation stoichiometries of
Cs$_{3-\textrm{x}}$C$_{60}$ with x $\approx$ 0 are found to be 38.19 and 36.88
K for the A15 and fcc forms, respectively, with the dichotomy in transition
temperature reflecting the larger ${\zeta}$ and structural disorder in the fcc
form. In the A15 form, modeled interacting charges and Coulomb potential
e$^2$/${\zeta}$ are shown to agree quantitatively with findings from
nuclear-spin relaxation and mid-infrared optical conductivity. In the fcc form,
suppression of $T_\textrm {C}$$^\textrm {meas}$ below $T_\textrm {C0}$ is
ascribed to native structural disorder. Phononic effects in conjunction with
Coulombic pairing are discussed.

to dissipation and a non-trivial coherent long-range exchange interaction whose
form goes beyond a simple power-law. The far-field terms of the potential --
which are particularly relevant for atomic separations comparable to the atomic
transition wavelength -- can give rise to energy spectra with one-sided
divergences in the Brillouin zone. The long-ranged character of the
interactions has another important consequence: it can break of the standard
bulk-boundary relation in topological insulators. We show that topological
properties such as the transport of an excitation along the edge of the lattice

latter is of particular relevance as dissipation and coherent interactions are
inevitably connected in our setting.

motion to the orientation of its candidate bow shock. Although these stars are
saturated in our imaging, we assess their motion by the shifts required to
minimize residuals in their Airy rings. The results limit the direction of each
star's motion to sectors less than 90 degrees wide. None of the five stars are
moving away from the Carina Nebula's central clusters as runaway stars would
be, confirming that a candidate bow shock is not necessarily indicative of a
runaway star. Two of the five stars are moving tangentially relative to the
orientation of their candidate bow shocks, both of which point at the OB
cluster Trumpler 14. In these cases, the large-scale flow of the interstellar
medium, powered by feedback from the cluster, appears to dominate over the
motion of the star in producing the observed candidate bow shock. The remaining
three stars all have some component of motion toward the central clusters,
meaning that we cannot distinguish whether their candidate bow shocks are
indicators of stellar motion, of the flow of ambient gas, or of density
gradients in their surroundings. In addition, these stars' lack of outward
motion hints that the distributed massive-star population in Carina's South
Pillars region formed in place, rather than migrating out from the
association's central clusters.

central sources of braiding errors are found to be the fidelity loss due to the
incomplete adiabaticity of the braiding operation as well as the hybridization
of the MBS. The explicit extraction of the braiding phase in the low-energy
Majorana sector from the full many-particle Hilbert space allows us to analyze
the breakdown of the independent-particle picture of Majorana braiding.

agents walking in a knowledge space. Recent studies proposed more realistic
dynamics, including the possibility of agents being influenced by others with
higher visibility or by their own memory. However, rather than dealing with
these two concepts separately, as previously approached, in this study we
propose a multi-agent random walk model for knowledge acquisition that
incorporates both concepts. More specifically, we employed the true self
avoiding walk alongside a new dynamics based on jumps, in which agents are
attracted by the influence of others. That was achieved by using a L\'evy
flight influenced by a field of attraction emanating from the agents. In order
to evaluate our approach, we use a set of network models and two real networks,
one generated from Wikipedia and another from the Web of Science. The results
were analyzed globally and by regions. In the global analysis, we found that
most of the dynamics parameters do not significantly affect the discovery
dynamics. The local analysis revealed a substantial difference of performance
depending on the network regions where the dynamics are occurring. In
particular, the dynamics at the core of networks tend to be more effective. The
choice of the dynamics parameters also had no significant impact to the
acquisition performance for the considered knowledge networks, even at the

perspective of studying diffusion phenomena in irregular structures.
  We have asked ourselves the following question: given a continuous function u

to associate to u a function Delta u which is, in the weak sense, its Laplacian
?
  We present, in the following, the results obtained by following the approach

enable us the, subject to its existence, to define the Laplacian of a
continuous function on this graph. This Laplacian appears as the renormalized
limit of a sequence of discrete Laplacians on a sequence of graphs which
converge to the one of the Weierstrass function. The normalization constants
related to each graph Laplacian are obtained thanks Dirichlet forms. The
spectrum of the Laplacian thus built is obtained through spectral decimation.

optimization (MBO), also known as Bayesian optimization, which addresses the
problem of expensive black-box optimization by approximating the given
objective function through a surrogate regression model. It is designed for
both single- and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous,
categorical and conditional parameters. Additional features include multi-point
batch proposal, parallelization, visualization, logging and error-handling.
mlrMBO is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can be
easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases, e.g., any
regression learner from the mlr toolbox for machine learning can be used, and
infill criteria and infill optimizers are easily exchangeable. We empirically
demonstrate that mlrMBO provides state-of-the-art performance by comparing it
on different benchmark scenarios against a wide range of other optimizers,
including DiceOptim, rBayesianOptimization, SPOT, SMAC, Spearmint, and
Hyperopt.

between photons and atoms. A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based
on such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed
by atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments
of atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs
independently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn
gives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum
memories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In
particular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be
significantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the
physics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it
have not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive
treatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free
space, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes
that are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends
of the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in
the many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective
radiance. Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all
optical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously
radiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired
channels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show
that these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic
structures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such
states. We find that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage
error that scales exponentially better with number of atoms than previously
known bounds.

loyalty is encouraged by certain community characteristics.
  In this paper we operationalize loyalty as a user-community relation: users
loyal to a community consistently prefer it over all others; loyal communities
retain their loyal users over time. By exploring this relation using a large
dataset of discussion communities from Reddit, we reveal that loyalty is
manifested in remarkably consistent behaviors across a wide spectrum of
communities. Loyal users employ language that signals collective identity and
engage with more esoteric, less popular content, indicating they may play a
curational role in surfacing new material. Loyal communities have denser
user-user interaction networks and lower rates of triadic closure, suggesting
that community-level loyalty is associated with more cohesive interactions and
less fragmentation into subgroups. We exploit these general patterns to predict
future rates of loyalty. Our results show that a user's propensity to become
loyal is apparent from their first interactions with a community, suggesting
that some users are intrinsically loyal from the very beginning.

bipartite system that are perfectly distinguishable via general entangled
measurements yet almost indistinguishable under LOCC, is a distinctive
signature of nonclassicality. The relevant figure of merit is the maximal ratio
(called data hiding ratio) between the distinguishability norms associated with
the two sets of measurements we are comparing, typically all measurements vs
LOCC protocols. For a bipartite $n\times n$ quantum system, it is known that
the data hiding ratio scales as $n$, i.e. the square root of the real dimension
of the local state space of density matrices. We show that for bipartite
$n_A\times n_B$ systems the maximum data hiding ratio against LOCC protocols is
$\Theta\left(\min\{n_A,n_B\}\right)$. This scaling is better than the
previously obtained upper bounds $O\left(\sqrt{n_A n_B}\right)$ and
$\min\{n_A^2, n_B^2\}$, and moreover our intuitive argument yields constants
close to optimal. In this paper, we investigate data hiding in the more general
context of general probabilistic theories (GPTs), an axiomatic framework for
physical theories encompassing only the most basic requirements about the
predictive power of the theory. The main result of the paper is the
determination of the maximal data hiding ratio obtainable in an arbitrary GPT,
which is shown to scale linearly in the minimum of the local dimensions. We
exhibit an explicit model achieving this bound up to additive constants,
finding that the quantum mechanical data hiding ratio is only of the order of
the square root of the maximal one. Our proof rests crucially on an unexpected
link between data hiding and the theory of projective and injective tensor
products of Banach spaces. Finally, we develop a body of techniques to compute
data hiding ratios for a variety of restricted classes of GPTs that support
further symmetries.

Numerical simulations attempting to understand turbulence are crucial for
guiding the design of future reactors. We investigate ion-scale turbulence via
gyrokinetic simulations in the outer core of the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak
(MAST). We perform a parameter scan in the values of the ITG and the flow
shear. We show that nonlinear simulations reproduce the experimental ion heat
flux and that the experimental values of the ITG and the flow shear lie close
to the turbulence threshold. We demonstrate that the system is subcritical in
the presence of flow shear, i.e., the system is formally stable, but
transitions to a turbulent state given a large enough initial perturbation. We
propose a scenario for the transition to turbulence previously unreported in
tokamak plasmas: close to the threshold, the plasma is dominated by a low
number of coherent long-lived structures; as the system is taken away from the
threshold into the more unstable regime, the number of these structures
increases until they fill the domain and a more conventional turbulence
emerges. We make comparisons of correlation properties between our simulations
and experimental measurements of density fluctuations from the MAST BES
diagnostic. We apply a synthetic diagnostic to our simulation data and find
reasonable agreement of the correlation properties of the simulated and
experimental turbulence, most notably of the correlation time. We show that the
properties of turbulence are essentially functions of the ion heat flux. We
find that turbulence close to the threshold is strongly affected by flow shear,

result is achieved making use of a coordinate transformation and simultaneously
accounting for lensing magnification. The calculation includes both local
corrections and terms that have been integrated along the line of sight. Our
fast implementation allows the production of many realizations that can be used
to forecast the performance of forthcoming wide-angle surveys and to estimate
the covariance matrix of the observables. To facilitate this use, we also
present a variant of LIGER designed for large-volume simulations with low mass
resolution. In this case, the galaxy distribution on large scales is obtained
by biasing the matter-density field. Finally, we present two sample
applications of LIGER. First, we discuss the impact of weak gravitational
lensing onto the angular clustering of galaxies in a Euclid-like survey. In
agreement with previous analytical studies, we find that magnification bias can
be measured with high confidence. Second, we focus on two generally neglected
Doppler-induced effects: magnification and the change of number counts with
redshift. We show that the corresponding redshift-space distortions can be

disc expected to be irradiated by only a weak external radiation field (at
least 10$^4$ times lower than the UV field irradiating the Orion Nebula Cluster
proplyds). We find that material at large radii ($>400$AU) in this disc is
sufficiently weakly gravitationally bound that significant mass loss can be
induced. Given the estimated values of the disc mass and accretion rate, the
viscous timescale is long ($\sim10$Myr) so the main evolutionary behaviour for
the first Myr of the disc's lifetime is truncation of the disc by
photoevaporation, with only modest changes effected by viscosity. We also
produce approximate synthetic observations of our models, finding substantial
emission from the flow which can explain the CO halo observed about IM Lup out
to $\geq1000$AU. Solutions that are consistent with the extent of the observed
CO emission generally imply that IM Lup is still in the process of having its
disc outer radius truncated. We conclude that IM Lup is subject to substantial
external photoevaporation, which raises the more general possibility that
external irradiation of the largest discs can be of significant importance even

slope (and its evolution) during a very bright flare from Sgr A*, the
supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center. Our study arises from
ambitious multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and
SINFONI. The average multi-wavelength spectrum is well reproduced by a broken
power-law with $\Gamma_{NIR}=1.7\pm0.1$ and $\Gamma_X=2.27\pm0.12$. The
difference in spectral slopes ($\Delta\Gamma=0.57\pm0.09$) strongly supports
synchrotron emission with a cooling break. The flare starts first in the NIR
with a flat and bright NIR spectrum, while X-ray radiation is detected only
after about $10^3$ s, when a very steep X-ray spectrum
($\Delta\Gamma=1.8\pm0.4$) is observed. These measurements are consistent with
synchrotron emission with a cooling break and they suggest that the high energy
cut-off in the electron distribution ($\gamma_{max}$) induces an initial
cut-off in the optical-UV band that evolves slowly into the X-ray band. The
temporal and spectral evolution observed in all bright X-ray flares are also in
line with a slow evolution of $\gamma_{max}$. We also observe hints for a
variation of the cooling break that might be induced by an evolution of the
magnetic field (from $B\sim30\pm8$ G to $B\sim4.8\pm1.7$ G at the X-ray peak).
Such drop of the magnetic field at the flare peak would be expected if the
acceleration mechanism is tapping energy from the magnetic field, such as in
magnetic reconnection. We conclude that synchrotron emission with a cooling
break is a viable process for Sgr A*'s flaring emission.

eclipse-related phenomena are usually described from an Earth-centric
perspective. Space missions to different parts of the Solar system, as well as
the mounting number of known exo-planets in habitable zones and the possibility
of sending featherweight robot spacecraft to them, prompt broader
considerations. Here, we derive the geometry of eclipses, transits and
occultations from a primarily exo-Earth viewpoint, and apply the formulation to
the Solar system and three types of three-body extrasolar planetary systems:
with 1 star and 2 planets (Case I), with 2 stars and 1 planet (Case II), and
with 1 planet, 1 star and 1 moon (Case III). We derive the general conditions
for total, partial and annular eclipses to occur at exo-syzygy, and implement
them in each case in concert with stability criteria. We then apply the
formalism to the TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-444 and Kepler-77 systems -- the first of
which contains multiple potentially habitable planets -- and provide reference
tables of both Solar system and TRAPPIST-1 syzygy properties. We conclude by
detailing a basic algebraic algorithm which can be used to quickly characterize
eclipse properties in any three-body system.

over other seesaw models since the potential new physics can be produced at the
TeV scale. We propose a model that generates the inverse seesaw mechanism via
spontaneous breaking of the lepton number, by extending the Standard Model with
two scalar singlets and two fermion singlets both charged under lepton number.
The model gives rise to a massless Majoron and a massive pseudoscalar which we
dub as massive Majoron, which corresponds to the Nambu-Goldstone boson of the
breaking of lepton number. If the massive Majoron is stable in cosmological
time, it might play the role of a suitable Dark Matter candidate. In this
scenario, we examine the model with a massive Majoron in the keV range. In this
regime, its decay mode to neutrinos is sensitive to the ratio between the vevs
of the new scalars ($\omega$), and it vanishes when $ \omega \simeq
\sqrt{2/3}$, which is valid within a large region in the parameter space. On
the other hand, the cosmological lifetime for the Dark Matter candidate places
constraints on its mass via scalar decays. In addition, simple mechanisms that
explain the Dark Matter relic abundance within this context and plausible
modifications to the proposed setup are briefly discussed.

galaxies are a challenging piece of the puzzle of galaxy formation in the near
Universe. These SEDs show some particular features in the submillimeter to
far-infrared wavelength range compared to normal, larger, and metal-richer
galaxies that cannot be explained by the current models. These can be
summarized as: a broadening of the IR peak, which implies a warmer dust
component; an excess of emission in the submm ($\sim$500 $\mu$m), that causes a
flattening of the submm/FIR slope; and a very low intensity of PAH emission
features. With the aim of explaining these emission patterns, the SEDs of a
sample of 27 simulated dwarf galaxies were calculated using the GRASIL-3D
radiation transfer code. This code has the particularity that it separately
treats the radiative transfer through dust grains within molecular clouds and
within the cirrus, the dense and diffuse components of the gas phase,
respectively. The simulated galaxies have stellar masses ranging from
10$^6$-10$^9$ M$_\odot$, and were obtained from a single simulation run within
a Local Group environment with initial conditions from the CLUES project. We
report a study of the IRAS, Spitzer and Herschel bands luminosities, and of the

agreement with observational data, with GRASIL-3D naturally reproducing the

  33","10.3847/1538-4357/aa9d3f",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observations reveal massive amounts of OVI around star-forming $L_*$
galaxies, with covering fractions of near unity extending to the host halo's
virial radius. This OVI absorption is typically kinematically centered upon
photoionized gas, with line widths that are suprathermal and kinematically
offset from the galaxy. We discuss various scenarios and whether they could
result in the observed phenomenology (cooling gas flows, boundary layers,
shocks, virialized gas, photoionized clouds in thermal equilibrium). If
predominantly collisionally ionized, as we argue is most probable, the OVI
observations require that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $L_*$ galaxies
holds nearly all the associated baryons within a virial radius ($\sim
10^{11}M_\odot$) and hosts massive flows of cooling gas with
$\approx30[nT/30{\rm~cm^{-3}K}]~M_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$, which must be largely
prevented from accreting onto the host galaxy. Cooling and feedback energetics
considerations require $10 <\langle nT\rangle<100{\rm~cm^{-3}K}$ for the warm
and hot halo gases. We argue that virialized gas, boundary layers, hot winds,
and shocks are unlikely to directly account for the bulk of the OVI.
Furthermore, we show that there is a robust constraint on the number density of
many of the photoionized $\sim10^4$K absorption systems that yields upper
bounds in the range $n<(0.1-3)\times10^{-3}(Z/0.3)$cm$^{-3}$, where $Z$ is the
metallicity, suggestive that the dominant pressure in some photoionized clouds
is nonthermal. This constraint, which requires minimal ionization modeling, is
in accord with the low densities inferred from more complex photoionization
modeling. The large amount of cooling gas that is inferred could re-form these
clouds in a fraction of the halo dynamical time, as some arguments require, and
it requires much of the feedback energy available from supernovae and stellar
winds to be dissipated in the CGM.

narrow emission line luminosity based on the detailed spectral energy
distributions of 53 bright quasars at low to moderate redshift
($0.0345<z<1.0002$). We adopted two functional forms to calculate
$L_{\textrm{iso}}$, the bolometric luminosity determined under the assumption
of isotropy: $L_{\textrm{iso}}=A\,L_{[O\,III]}$ for comparison with the
literature and log$(L_{iso})=B+C\,$log$(L_{[O\,III]})$, which better
characterizes the data. We also explored whether ""Eigenvector 1"", which
describes the range of quasar spectral properties and quantifies their
diversity, introduces scatter into the $L_{[O\,III]}-L_{iso}$ relationship. We
found that the [O III] bolometric correction can be significantly improved by
adding a term including the equivalent width ratio $R_{Fe\,II}\equiv
EW_{Fe\,II}/EW_{H\beta}$, which is an Eigenvector 1 indicator. Inclusion of
$R_{Fe\,II}$ in predicting $L_{iso}$ is significant at nearly the $3\sigma$
level and reduces the scatter and systematic offset of the luminosity
residuals. Typically, [O III] bolometric corrections are adopted for Type 2
sources where the quasar continuum is not observed and in these cases,
$R_{Fe\,II}$ cannot be measured. We searched for an alternative measure of
Eigenvector 1 that could be measured in the optical spectra of Type 2 sources
but were unable to identify one. Thus, the main contribution of this work is to
present an improved [O III] bolometric correction based on measured bolometric
luminosities and highlight the Eigenvector 1 dependence of the correction in
Type 1 sources.

a preferred local direction for the small-scale dynamics, altering the
statistics of turbulence from the isotropic case. This happens even in the
absence of a total magnetic flux, since MHD turbulence forms randomly oriented
large-scale domains of strong magnetic field. It is therefore customary to
study small-scale magnetic plasma turbulence by assuming a strong background
magnetic field relative to the turbulent fluctuations. This is done, for
example, in reduced models of plasmas, such as reduced MHD, reduced-dimension
kinetic models, gyrokinetics, etc., which make theoretical calculations easier
and numerical computations cheaper. Recently, however, it has become clear that
the turbulent energy dissipation is concentrated in the regions of strong
magnetic field variations. A significant fraction of the energy dissipation may
be localized in very small volumes corresponding to the boundaries between
strongly magnetized domains. In these regions the reduced models are not
applicable. This has important implications for studies of particle heating and
acceleration in magnetic plasma turbulence. The goal of this work is to
systematically investigate the relationship between local magnetic field
variations and magnetic energy dissipation, and to understand its implications
for modeling energy dissipation in realistic turbulent plasmas.

Since the sum of a cocoercive and a monotone-Lipschitz operator is monotone and

implementing both operators twice per iteration and without taking into

these factors modulate how frequency information is encoded and produced, but
only the production-side modulations result in regularization (i.e. cause
learners to eliminate variation from the observed input). We formalize the

generate predictions for the amount of regularity that would develop in each

can become more complex when put into the context of cultural evolution:

cortical activity recorded in monkeys. Despite its success, a clear

to better understand how the transitions between delayed to anticipated
synchronization and anticipated synchronization to phase-drift regimes occur.
We construct a map based on the PRC method to predict the phase-locking regimes

simultaneously for the inputs from sender and interneuron into the receiver, is
essential to reproduce the numerical results obtained using a Hodgkin-Huxley
model for the neurons. On the contrary, the typical approximation that
considers a sum of two independent single-variable PRCs fails for intermediate

particular, it looses the delayed-synchronization to

The proposed re-formulation of the path integral coincides with the familiar
formulation whenever the path integral is well-defined. In particular, it is
consistent with respect to lattice formulations and Wick rotations, i.e., it
can be used in Euclidean and Minkowskian space-time. The path integral
regularization is introduced through the generalized Kontsevich-Vishik trace,
that is, the extension of the classical trace to Fourier Integral Operators.
Physically, we are replacing the time-evolution semi-group by a holomorphic
family of operator families such that the corresponding path integrals are
well-defined in some half space of $\mathbb{C}$. The regularized path integral
is, thus, defined through analytic continuation. This regularization can be
performed by means of stationary phase approximation or computed analytically
depending only on the Hamiltonian and the observable (i.e., known a priori). In
either case, the computational effort to evaluate path integrals or
expectations of observables reduces to the evaluation of integrals over
spheres. Furthermore, computations can be performed directly in the continuum
and applications (analytic computations and their implementations) to a number

measure the $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ ratio. The measurements are motivated by the low
helium ionization observed in the warm ionized medium (WIM) and in the inner
Galaxy diffuse ionized regions (DIR). Our data indicate that the helium is not
uniformly ionized in the three observed sources. Helium lines are not detected
toward a few observed positions in sources G10.15-0.34 \& G23.46-0.20 and the
upper limits of the $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ ratio obtained are 0.03 and 0.05

indicated by helium line detection toward the bright radio continuum emission
from the sources with mean $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ value 0.06$\pm$0.02. Our data
thus show that helium in diffuse gas located a few pc away from the young
massive stars embedded in the observed regions is not fully ionized.We
investigate the origin of the non-uniform helium ionization and rule out the
possibilities : (a) that the helium is doubly ionized in the observed regions
and (b) that the low $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ values are due to additional hydrogen
ionizing radiation produced by accreting low-mass stars (Smith 2014). We find
that selective absorption of ionizing photons by dust can result in low helium

  Evaluation",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evaluating a policy by deploying it in the real world can be risky and
costly. Off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) algorithms use historical data
collected from running a previous policy to evaluate a new policy, which
provides a means for evaluating a policy without requiring it to ever be
deployed. Importance sampling is a popular OPE method because it is robust to
partial observability and works with continuous states and actions. However,
the amount of historical data required by importance sampling can scale
exponentially with the horizon of the problem: the number of sequential
decisions that are made. We propose using policies over temporally extended
actions, called options, and show that combining these policies with importance
sampling can significantly improve performance for long-horizon problems. In
addition, we can take advantage of special cases that arise due to
options-based policies to further improve the performance of importance
sampling. We further generalize these special cases to a general covariance
testing rule that can be used to decide which weights to drop in an IS
estimate, and derive a new IS algorithm called Incremental Importance Sampling
that can provide significantly more accurate estimates for a broad class of
domains.

underlying features within a data set, but inference in such models can be
slow. Inferring underlying features using Markov chain Monte Carlo either
relies on an uncollapsed representation, which leads to poor mixing, or on a
collapsed representation, which leads to a quadratic increase in computational
complexity. Existing attempts at distributing inference have introduced
additional approximation within the inference procedure. In this paper we
present a novel algorithm to perform asymptotically exact parallel Markov chain
Monte Carlo inference for Indian Buffet Process models. We take advantage of
the fact that the features are conditionally independent under the
beta-Bernoulli process. Because of this conditional independence, we can
partition the features into two parts: one part containing only the finitely
many instantiated features and the other part containing the infinite tail of
uninstantiated features. For the finite partition, parallel inference is simple
given the instantiation of features. But for the infinite tail, performing
uncollapsed MCMC leads to poor mixing and hence we collapse out the features.
The resulting hybrid sampler, while being parallel, produces samples
asymptotically from the true posterior.

powerful solutions for this problem. In this thesis, we first describe the
Yao's protocol in detail, and include the complete list of optimizations over

We also look into generic Yao implementations (including garbled RAM) to

cover the specific real-world applications for further illustration. Moreover,
in some scenarios, the functionality itself may also need to be kept private

the parameter to be estimated is imprinted on the initial state by a

been shown that one cannot improve the channel quantum Fisher information by
adding ancillas and letting the system interact with them. Here we investigate
the general case, where the Hamiltonian is not necessarily a phase shift, and
show that in this case in general it \emph{is} possible to increase the quantum
channel information and to reach an upper bound. This can be done by adding a
term proportional to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, or by subtracting a
term to the original Hamiltonian. Both methods do not make use of any ancillas
and show therefore that for quantum channel estimation with arbitrary
parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, entanglement with an ancillary system is not
necessary to reach the best possible sensitivity. By adding an operator to the
Hamiltonian we can also modify the time scaling of the channel quantum Fisher
information. We illustrate our techniques with NV-center magnetometry and the
estimation of the direction of a magnetic field in a given plane using a single

neutron stars, are among the main targets of current detectors like Advanced
LIGO and Virgo. In the case of sources, like pulsars, which rotational
parameters are measured through electromagnetic observations, typical searches
assume that the gravitational wave frequency is at a given known fixed ratio
with respect to the star rotational frequency. For instance, for a neutron star
rotating around one of its principal axis of inertia the gravitational signal
frequency would be exactly two times the rotational frequency of the star. It
is possible, however, that this assumption is wrong. This is why search
algorithms able to take into account a possible small mismatch between the
gravitational waves frequency and the frequency inferred from electromagnetic
observations have been developed. In this paper we present an improved pipeline
to perform such narrow-band searches for continuous gravitational waves from
neutron stars, about three orders of magnitude faster than previous
implementations. The algorithm that we have developed is based on the {\it
5-vectors} framework and is able to perform a fully coherent search over a
frequency band of width $\mathcal{O}$(Hertz) and for hundreds of spin-down
values running a few hours on a standard workstation. This new algorithm opens
the possibility of long coherence time searches for objects which rotational

beamforming vector that maximizes the transmission rate. For frequency-division
duplex, a transmitter is not able to estimate CSI directly and has to obtain a
quantized transmit beamforming vector from the receiver via a rate-limited
feedback channel. We assume that time evolution of MIMO channels is modeled as
a Gauss-Markov process parameterized by a temporal-correlation coefficient.
Since feedback rate is usually low, we assume rank-one transmit beamforming or
transmission with single data stream. For given feedback rate, we analyze the
optimal feedback interval that maximizes the average received power of the
systems with two transmit or two receive antennas. For other system sizes, the
optimal feedback interval is approximated by maximizing the rate difference in
a large system limit. Numerical results show that the large system

equation in a 'box', defined through periodic boundary conditions. The DNS
flows live in a compact space and they are not isotropic in their large scales.
The investigation of important phenomena of isotropic turbulence, such as
anomalous scaling, through the DNS is affected by large scale effects. In this
work we put isotropic turbulence - or better, the associated formal theory - in
a 'box', through imposing periodicity at the level of the correlations
functions. We offer a framework where one may investigate isotropic
theories/models through the data of DNS in a formally consistent manner. We
work at the level of the Karman-Howarth equation. Unlike the Navier-Stokes
equation, infinitely smooth periodicity is obstructed in this theory, a fact
expressed by a sequence of relations obeyed by the normal modes of the
Karman-Howarth equation. Similar relations are imparted to the two-point
functions under the condition that the energy spectrum and energy transfer
function are realizable. Naturally constructed closures scheme for the
Karman-Howarth equation do not conform to such relations, thereby destroying
realizability. A closure can be made to conform to a finite number of them by
adding corrective terms, in a procedure which possesses certain analogies with
the renormalization of quantum field theory. The spectrum becomes unphysical
(through sign-changing oscillations) for infinitely large wavenumbers, but we
can controllably extend the regime where the spectrum remains physical deep
enough in the dissipation range so that to be realistically adequate. We show
that one or two such 'regularity relations' are needed at most for comparisons

interpolation of fractional samples. The video coding standards usually adopt
fixed interpolation filters that are derived from the signal processing theory.
However, as video signal is not stationary, the fixed interpolation filters may
turn out less efficient. Inspired by the great success of convolutional neural

interpolation filter (CNNIF) for video coding. Different from previous studies,
one difficulty for training CNNIF is the lack of ground-truth since the
fractional samples are actually not available. Our solution for this problem is
to derive the ""ground-truth"" of fractional samples by smoothing high-resolution

increasing amounts of context to better predict events and user behaviors,
requiring rich records of users' or devices' spatiotemporal histories.
Maintaining these rich histories requires frequent sampling and indexed storage
of spatiotemporal data that pushes the limits of resource-constrained mobile
devices. Today's apps offload processing and storing contextual information,
but this increases response time, often relies on the user's data connection,
and runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper
we motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and
introduce PACO (Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading), an
architecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while
allowing flexibility in storing additional context. The PACO API's innovations
enable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices'
resource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for
Android, we demonstrate that PACO can support expressive application queries
entirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses PACO's energy
consumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, PACO
facilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also
supports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the
cloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.

increases during discharge if a constant pressure is applied to the free

investigated by taking into consideration the bandgap formed by interfacial
charge transfer at the metal contacts. Our results show that a charge injection
barrier (Schottky barrier) does not contribute to the contact resistance
because the BLG under the contacts is always degenerately doped. We also showed
that the contact-doping-induced increase in the density of states (DOS) of BLG
under the metal contacts decreases the contact resistance owing to enhanced
charge carrier tunnelling at the contacts. The contact doping can be enhanced
by inserting molecular dopant layers into the metal contacts. However, carrier
tunnelling through the insertion layer increases the contact resistance, and
thus, alternative device structures should be employed. Finally, we showed that
the inter-band transport by variable range hopping via in-gap states is the
largest contributor to contact resistance when the carrier type of the gated
channel is opposite to the contact doping carrier type. This indicates that the
strategy of contact resistance reduction by the contact-doping-induced increase
in the DOS is effective only for a single channel transport branch (n- or
p-type) depending on the contact doping carrier type.

wavenumber-dependent expansion coefficients constitute a characteristic

a long-standing problem in polymer physics regarding the molecular relaxation
in entangled polymers after a large step deformation. The classical tube theory
of Doi and Edwards predicts a fast chain retraction process immediately after
the deformation, followed by a slow orientation relaxation through the
reptation mechanism. This chain retraction hypothesis, which is the keystone of
the tube theory for macromolecular flow and deformation, was critically
examined by analyzing the fine features of the two-dimensional anisotropic

storage space, opens a new research area on how to utilize these resources at
the edge network to improve users' quality of experience (QoE) (e.g., a short
startup delay and smooth playback). One important research interest in this
area is content prefetching, which predicts and accurately fetches contents
ahead of users' requests to shift the traffic away during peak periods.
However, in practice, the different video watching patterns among users, and
the varying network connection status lead to the time-varying server load,
which eventually makes the content prefetching problem challenging. To
understand this challenge, this paper first performs a large-scale measurement
study on users' AP connection and TV series watching patterns using
real-traces. Then, based on the obtained insights, we formulate the content
prefetching problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The objective is to
strike a balance between the increased prefetching&storage cost incurred by
incorrect prediction and the reduced content download delay because of
successful prediction. A learning-based approach is proposed to solve this
problem and another three algorithms are adopted as baselines. In particular,
first, we investigate the performance lower bound by using a random algorithm,
and the upper bound by using an ideal offline approach. Then, we present a
heuristic algorithm as another baseline. Finally, we design a reinforcement
learning algorithm that is more practical to work in the online manner. Through
extensive trace-based experiments, we demonstrate the performance gain of our
design. Remarkably, our learning-based algorithm achieves a better precision
and hit ratio (e.g., 80%) with about 70% (resp. 50%) cost saving compared to
the random (resp. heuristic) algorithm.

responses of the primary as forced linear oscillations, as a function of the
tidal forcing frequency $\omega_{\rm tide}=2(\Omega_{\rm orb}-\Omega)$, where
$\Omega_{\rm orb}$ is the mean orbital angular velocity and $\Omega$ is the
angular velocity of rotation of the primary star. The amplitude of the tidal
responses is proportional to the parameter $f_0\propto (M_2/M)(a_{\rm
orb}/R)^{-3}$, where $M$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the primary and companion
stars, $R$ is the radius of the primary and $a_{\rm orb}$ is the mean orbital
separation between the stars. For a given $f_0$, the amplitudes depend on
$\omega_{\rm tide}$ and become large when $\omega_{\rm tide}$ is in resonance
with natural frequencies of the star. Using the tidal responses, we calculate
axisymmetric mean flows, assuming that the mean flows are non-oscillatory flows
driven via non-linear effects of linear tidal responses. We find that the
$\phi$-component of the mean flow velocity dominates. We also find that the
amplitudes of the mean flows are large only in the surface layers where
non-adiabatic effects are significant and that the amplitudes are confined to
the equatorial regions of the star. Depending on $M_2/M$ and $a_{\rm orb}/R$,
the amplitudes of mean flows at the surface become significant.

consider the context and sensor signals. It also needs to decide what
information is communicated and how it is represented in or understood from
signals. Therefore, communication should be realized comprehensively together
with its purpose and other functions.
  The recent successful results in end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) show
the importance of comprehensive learning and the usefulness of end-to-end RL.
Although little is known, we have shown that a variety of communications emerge
through RL using a (recurrent) neural network (NN). Here, three of them are
introduced.
  In the 1st one, negotiation to avoid conflicts among 4 randomly-picked agents
was learned. Each agent generates a binary signal from the output of its
recurrent NN (RNN), and receives 4 signals from the agents three times. After
learning, each agent made an appropriate final decision after negotiation for
any combination of 4 agents. Differentiation of individuality among the agents
also could be seen.
  The 2nd one focused on discretization of communication signal. A sender agent
perceives the receiver's location and generates a continuous signal twice by
its RNN. A receiver agent receives them sequentially, and moves according to
its RNN's output to reach the sender's location. When noises were added to the
signal, it was binarized through learning and 2-bit communication was
established.
  The 3rd one focused on end-to-end comprehensive communication. A sender
receives 1,785-pixel real camera image on which a real robot can be seen, and
sends two sounds whose frequencies are computed by its NN. A receiver receives
them, and two motion commands for the robot are generated by its NN. After
learning, though some preliminary learning was necessary for the sender, the
robot could reach the goal from any initial location.

$\boldsymbol{e}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{e}_j$ are the directions of spins in this
bond, and $\boldsymbol{\cal P}_{ij}$ is the pseudovector containing all the
information about the crystallographic symmetry of the considered system. The
expression describes the ferroelectric activity in various magnets with
noncollinear but otherwise nonpolar magnetic structures, which would yield no
polarization without SO interaction, including the magnetoelectric (ME) effect,
caused by the ferromagnetic canting of spins in the external magnetic field,
and spin-spiral multiferroics. The abilities of this theory are demonstrated
for the the analysis of linear ME effect in Cr$_2$O$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$ and
properties multiferroic MnWO$_4$ and $\beta$-MnO$_2$. In all considered
examples, the theory perfectly describes the symmetry properties of the induced
polarization. However, in some cases, the values of this polarization are
underestimated, suggesting that other effects, besides the spin and electronic
ones, can also play an important role.

for CPR methods and the systems arising from the PC approach. Due to the usage
of split-forms, the major challenge is to construct entropy stable numerical
fluxes. For the first time, such numerical fluxes are constructed for all

tests, we verify our results and show also the advantage of the given ansatz
using CPR methods. Moreover, one of the simulations, i.e. Burgers' equation
equipped with an initial shock, demonstrates quite fascinating observations.
The behaviour of the numerical solutions from several methods (finite volume,
finite difference, CPR) differ significantly from each other. Through careful

the system to varying dissipation. Furthermore, it should be stressed that the

dwarf nova outbursts observed in cataclysmic variables. When, as in
intermediate polars (IP), the accreting white dwarf is magnetized, the disc is
truncated at the magnetospheric radius, but for mass-transfer rates
corresponding to the thermal-viscous instability such systems should still
exhibit dwarf-nova outbursts. Yet, the majority of intermediate polars in which
the magnetic field is not large enough to completely disrupt the accretion
disc, seem to be stable, and the rare observed outbursts, in particular in
systems with long orbital periods, are much shorter than normal dwarf-nova
outbursts. We investigate the predictions of the disc instability model for
intermediate polars in order to determine which of the observed properties of
these systems can be explained by the DIM. We use our numerical code for the
time evolution of accretion discs, modified to include the effects of the
magnetic field, with constant or variable mass transfer from the secondary
star. We show that intermediate polars have mass transfer low enough and
magnetic fields large enough to keep the accretion disc stable on the cold
equilibrium branch. We show that the infrequent and short outbursts observed in
long period systems, such as e.g., TV Col, cannot be attributed to the
thermal-viscous instability of the accretion disc, but instead have to be
triggered by an enhanced mass-transfer from the secondary, or, more likely, by
some instability coupling the white dwarf magnetic field with that generated by
the magnetorotational instability operating in the accretion disc. Longer
outbursts (a few days) could result from the disc instability.

better fits the real-word applications. Both image-text and text-image

testing sets are identical. That is, it is usually assumed that the query falls
into some pre-defined classes. However, in practice, the content of a query
image/text may vary extensively, and the retrieval system does not necessarily
know in advance the class label of a query. Considering the inconsistency
between the real-world applications and laboratory assumptions, we think that
the existing protocol that works under identical train/test classes can be
modified and improved.
  This work is dedicated to addressing this problem by considering the protocol
under an extendable scenario, \ie, the training and testing classes do not
overlap. We provide extensive benchmarking results obtained by the existing
protocol and the proposed new protocol on several commonly used datasets. We
demonstrate a noticeable performance drop when the testing classes are unseen
during training. Additionally, a trivial solution, \ie, directly using the
predicted class label for cross-media retrieval, is tested. We show that the
trivial solution is very competitive in traditional non-extendable retrieval,
but becomes less so under the new settings. The train/test split, evaluation
code, and benchmarking results are publicly available on our website.

time of a wide range of boolean data structure problems, most notably, on the
query time of dynamic range counting over $\mathbb{F}_2$ ([Pat07]). Proving an

the pulse profiles with Gaussian functions to determine the phase of each

phase estimation algorithm given the matrix exponential of the Hamiltonian,
$exp(-i\mathcal{H})$. The difficulty of this exponentiation impedes the
applications of the phase estimation algorithm particularly when $\mathcal{H}$
is composed of non-commuting terms. In this paper, we present a method to use
the Hamiltonian matrix directly in the phase estimation algorithm by using an
ancilla based framework: In this framework, we also show how to find the power
of the Hamiltonian matrix-which is necessary in the phase estimation
algorithm-through the successive applications. This may eliminate the necessity
of matrix exponential for the phase estimation algorithm and therefore provide
an efficient way to estimate the eigenvalues of particular Hamiltonians. The
classical and quantum algorithmic complexities of the framework are analyzed
for the Hamiltonians which can be written as a sum of simple unitary matrices
and shown that a Hamiltonian of order $2^n$ written as a sum of $L$ number of
simple terms can be used in the phase estimation algorithm with $(n+1+logL)$
number of qubits and $O(2^anL)$ number of quantum operations, where $a$ is the
number of iterations in the phase estimation. In addition, we use the
Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule as an example system and present the
simulation results for finding its ground state energy.

of graph mining applications. However, the problem has a drawback; it may
happen that the obtained subset is too large or too small in comparison with
the size desired in the application at hand. In this study, we address the size
issue of the densest subgraph problem by generalizing the density of
$S\subseteq V$. Specifically, we introduce the $f$-density of $S\subseteq V$,
which is defined as $w(S)/f(|S|)$, where $f:\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow

maximizes the $f$-density $w(S)/f(|S|)$. Although $f$-DS does not explicitly
specify the size of the output subset of vertices, we can handle the above size
issue using a convex/concave size function $f$ appropriately. For $f$-DS with
convex function $f$, we propose a nearly-linear-time algorithm with a provable
approximation guarantee. On the other hand, for $f$-DS with concave function
$f$, we propose an LP-based exact algorithm, a flow-based $O(|V|^3)$-time exact
algorithm for unweighted graphs, and a nearly-linear-time approximation

dataset is complete enough to detect stars down to 0.2~M$_\odot$, which is the
deepest optical observations so far for the cluster. We identified 384
candidate young stellar objects (YSOs; 101 Class I/II and 283 Class III) within
the cluster using various colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams. We
inferred the mean age of the identified YSOs to be $\sim$ 2.5 Myr and mass in
the range 0.3 - 2.5 M$_\odot$. The mass function of our YSO sample has a power
law index of -1.23 $\pm$ 0.23, close to the Salpeter value (-1.35), and
consistent with those of other star-forming complexes. We explored the disk
evolution of the cluster members and found that the diskless sources are
relatively older compared to the disk bearing YSO candidates. We examined the
effect of high-mass stars on the circumstellar disks and found that within
uncertainties, the influence of massive stars on the disk fraction seems to be
insignificant. We also studied the spatial correlation of the YSOs with the
distribution of gas and dust of the complex to conclude that IC 1805 would have
formed in a large filamentary cloud.

finite set of kinematically feasible motion primitives. These motion primitives
are then used to create a regular state lattice that can be searched for a
solution using standard graph-search algorithms. To make this graph-search

in this area were focused on transmitting an individual information stream to
each user by constructing weighted linear combinations of symbol blocks

by: i) transmitting distinct data streams to groups of users and ii) applying
precoding on a symbol-per-symbol basis. In this context, the current survey
presents a unified view and classification of precoding techniques with respect
to two main axes: i) the switching rate of the precoding weights, leading to
the classes of block- and symbol-level precoding, ii) the number of users that
each stream is addressed to, hence unicast-/multicast-/broadcast- precoding.
Furthermore, the classified techniques are compared through representative
numerical results to demonstrate their relative performance and uncover
fundamental insights. Finally, a list of open theoretical problems and

to the radio auroral emission of Earth and Jupiter. We predict the radio
emission from V830 Tau b, the youngest (2 Myr) detected exoplanet to date. We
model the host star wind using 3DMHD simulations that take into account its
surface magnetism. With this, we constrain the local conditions around V830 Tau
b that we use to then compute its radio emission. We estimate average radio
flux densities of 6 to 24mJy, depending on the assumed radius of the planet
(one or two Rjupiter). These radio fluxes are present peaks that are up to
twice the average values. We show here that these fluxes are weakly dependent
(a factor of 1.8) on the assumed polar planetary magnetic field (10 to 100G),
opposed to the maximum frequency of the emission, which ranges from 18 to
240MHz. We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By
comparing our results with VLA and VLBA observations of the system, we
constrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be <3e-9 Msun/yr, with likely values
between ~1e-12 and 1e-10 Msun/yr. The frequency-dependent extension of the
radio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of
275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar,
could be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically
thick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so. Planetary emission can only
propagate in the stellar wind plasma if the frequency of the cyclotron emission
exceeds the stellar wind plasma frequency. For that, we find that for planetary
radio emission to propagate through the host star wind, planetary magnetic
field strengths larger than ~1.3 to 13 G are required. The V830 Tau system is a
very interesting system for conducting radio observations from both the
perspective of radio emission from the planet as well as from the host star's
wind.

by Hu, Liu and Nualart in order to generalize the classical Euler scheme for

modified Euler scheme to the rough case $\frac13<H<\frac12$. Namely, we show a
convergence rate of order $n^{\frac12-2H}$ for the scheme, and we argue that
this rate is exact. We also derive a central limit theorem for the renormalized
error of the scheme, thanks to some new techniques for asymptotics of weighted
random sums. Our main idea is based on the following observation: the triple of
processes obtained by considering the fBm, the scheme process and the
normalized error process, can be lifted to a new rough path. In addition, the
H\""older norm of this new rough path has an estimate which is independent of
the step-size of the scheme.

with period shorter than 100 days orbit 30-50\% of Sun-like type stars. Their
orbital configuration -- measured as the period ratio distribution of adjacent
planets in multi-planet systems -- is a strong constraint for formation models.
Here we use N-body simulations with synthetic forces from an underlying
evolving gaseous disk to model the formation and long-term dynamical evolution
of super-Earth systems. While the gas disk is present, planetary embryos grow
and migrate inward to form a resonant chain anchored at the inner edge of the
disk. These resonant chains are far more compact than the observed super-Earth
systems. Once the gas dissipates resonant chains may become dynamically
unstable. They undergo a phase of giant impacts that spreads the systems out.
Disk turbulence has no measurable effect on the outcome. Our simulations match
observations if a small fraction of resonant chains remain stable, while most
super-Earths undergo a late dynamical instability. Our statistical analysis
restricts the contribution of stable systems to less than $25\%$. Our results
also suggest that the large fraction of observed single planet systems does not
necessarily imply any dichotomy in the architecture of planetary systems.
Finally, we use the low abundance of resonances in Kepler data to argue that,
in reality, the survival of resonant chains happens likely only in $\sim 5\%$
of the cases. This leads to a mystery: in our simulations only 50-60\% of
resonant chains became unstable whereas at least 75\% (and probably 90-95\%)
must be unstable to match observations.

metric spaces. Kakeya sets in Euclidean spaces are sets of zero Lebesgue
measure containing a segment of length one in every direction. A famous
conjecture, known as Kakeya conjecture, states that the Hausdorff dimension of
any Kakeya set should equal the dimension of the space. It was proved only in
the plane, whereas in higher dimensions both geometric and arithmetic
combinatorial methods were used to obtain partial results. In the first part of
the thesis we define generalized Kakeya sets in metric spaces satisfying
certain axioms. These allow us to prove some lower bounds for the Hausdorff
dimension of generalized Kakeya sets using two methods introduced in the
Euclidean context by Bourgain and Wolff. With this abstract setup we can deal
with many special cases in a unified way, recovering some known results and
proving new ones. In the second part we present various applications. We
recover some of the known estimates for the classical Kakeya and Nikodym sets
and for curved Kakeya sets. Moreover, we prove lower bounds for the dimension
of sets containing a segment in a line through every point of a hyperplane and
of an (n-1)-rectifiable set. We then show dimension estimates for Furstenberg
type sets (already known in the plane) and for the classical Kakeya sets with
respect to a metric that is homogeneous under non-isotropic dilations and in
which balls are rectangular boxes with sides parallel to the coordinate axis.
Finally, we prove lower bounds for the classical bounded Kakeya sets and a
natural modification of them in Carnot groups of step two whose second layer
has dimension one, such as the Heisenberg group. On the other hand, if the
dimension is bigger than one we show that we cannot use this approach.

rate of inclusive $B$ hadron production ($pp\to BX$) at both 7 and 13~TeV
centre-of-mass (CoM) energies. As part of this measurement, the ratio of these
two cross section measurements has been presented differentially in $B$ hadron
pseudorapidity within the range of $\eta_B \in [2.0,5.0]$. A large tension
($4\sigma$) is observed for the ratio measurement in the lower pseudorapidity
range of $\eta_B \in [2.0,3.0]$, where the data is observed to exceed
theoretical predictions, while consistency is found at larger $\eta_B$ values.
This behaviour is not expected within perturbative QCD, and can only be
achieved by introducing ad-hoc features into the structure of the
non-perturbative gluon PDF within the region of $x\in[10^{-3},10^{-4}]$.
Specifically, the gluon PDF must grow extremely quickly with decreasing $x$
within this kinematic range, closely followed by a period of decelerated
growth. However, such behaviour is highly disfavoured by global fits to proton
structure. Further studies of the available LHCb $B$ and $D$ hadron cross

tension in the (pseudo)rapidity region of $[2.0,2.5]$.

future fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems is challenging due
to its high hardware cost and power consumption. One promising solution to
address this challenge is to adopt the low-resolution analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) architecture. However, the practical implementation of such
architecture is challenging due to the required complex signal processing to
compensate the coarse quantization caused by low-resolution ADCs. Therefore,
few high-resolution ADCs are reserved in the recently proposed mixed-ADC
architecture to enable low-complexity transceiver algorithms. In contrast to
previous works over Rayleigh fading channels, we investigate the performance of
mixed-ADC massive MIMO systems over the Rician fading channel, which is more
general for the 5G scenarios like Internet of Things (IoT). Specially, novel
closed-form approximate expressions for the uplink achievable rate are derived
for both cases of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). With
the increasing Rician $K$-factor, the derived results show that the achievable
rate will converge to a fixed value. We also obtain the power-scaling law that
the transmit power of each user can be scaled down proportionally to the
inverse of the number of base station (BS) antennas for both perfect and
imperfect CSI. Moreover, we reveal the trade-off between the achievable rate
and energy efficiency with respect to key system parameters including the
quantization bits, number of BS antennas, Rician $K$-factor, user transmit
power, and CSI quality. Finally, numerical results are provided to show that
the mixed-ADC architecture can achieve a better energy-rate trade-off compared
with the ideal infinite-resolution and low-resolution ADC architectures.

of the space around the particles into separate Voronoi cells, e.g. applicable
to granular materials. A generalization of the conventional Voronoi diagram for
points or monodisperse spheres is the Set Voronoi diagram, also known as
navigational map or tessellation by zone of influence. In this construction, a
Set Voronoi cell contains the volume that is closer to the surface of one
particle than to the surface of any other particle. This is required for
aspherical or polydisperse systems.
  Pomelo is designed to be easy to use and as generic as possible. It directly
supports common particle shapes and offers a generic mode, which allows to deal
with any type of particles that can be described mathematically. Pomelo can
create output in different standard formats, which allows direct visualization

measured whole-surface temperatures, combined with a survey of gamma-ray, X-ray

Fermi LAT pulsars have significant outer-gap pair creation. For radio-loud
pulsars with positive polar-cap corotational charge density and an ion-proton
plasma there must be an outward flow of electrons from some other part of the
magnetosphere to maintain a constant net charge on the star. In the absence of

network perimeter. To secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating
components must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be
allowed to send and receive messages. This is achieved using an authentication
framework. Cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties
and provide secure communication channels (e.g., Internet communication).
However, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict
the types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used. In
particular, asymmetric cryptography is computationally infeasible during
vehicle operation.
  In this work, we address the challenges of designing authentication protocols
for automotive systems. We present Lightweight Authentication for Secure
Automotive Networks (LASAN), a full lifecycle authentication approach. We
describe the core LASAN protocols and show how they protect the internal
vehicle network while complying with the real-time constraints and low
computational resources of this domain. Unlike previous work, we also explain
how this framework can be integrated into all aspects of the automotive
lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates.
We evaluate LASAN in two different ways: First, we analyze the security
properties of the protocols using established protocol verification techniques
based on formal methods. Second, we evaluate the timing requirements of LASAN
and compare these to other frameworks using a new highly modular discrete event
simulator for in-vehicle networks, which we have developed for this evaluation.

the 1.2 mm band at a sub-arcsecond resolution with ALMA. An infalling-rotating
envelope is traced by the CS line, while a very compact component with a broad
velocity width is observed for the CS, SO, HNCO, NH$_2$CHO, and HCOOCH$_3$
lines. Although this source is regarded as the warm carbon-chain chemistry
(WCCC) candidate source at a 1000 au scale, complex organic molecules
characteristic of hot corinos such as NH$_2$CHO and HCOOCH$_3$ are detected in
the vicinity of the protostar. Thus, both hot corino chemistry and WCCC are
seen in L483. Although such a mixed chemical character source has been
recognized as an intermediate source in previous single-dish observations, we
here report the first spatially-resolved detection. A kinematic structure of
the infalling-rotating envelope is roughly explained by a simple ballistic
model with the protostellar mass of 0.1--0.2 $M_\odot$ and the radius of the
centrifugal barrier (a half of the centrifugal radius) of 30--200 au, assuming
the inclination angle of 80\degr\ (0\degr\ for a face-on). The broad line
emission observed in the above molecules most likely comes from the disk
component inside the centrifugal barrier. Thus, a drastic chemical change is
seen around the centrifugal barrier.

its genome. For this purpose, experimental techniques such as Hi-C detecting
chromosomal contacts are used to probe the three-dimensional genomic structure.
These experiments yield topological information, consistently showing a
hierarchical subdivision of the genome into self-interacting domains across
many organisms. Current methods for detecting these domains using the Hi-C
contact matrix, i.e. a doubly-stochastic matrix, are mostly based on the
assumption that the domains are distinct, thus non-overlapping. For overcoming
this simplification and for being able to unravel a possible nested domain
structure, we developed a probabilistic graphical model that makes no a priori
assumptions on the domain structure. Within this approach, the Hi-C contact
matrix is analyzed using an Ising like probabilistic graphical model whose
coupling constant is proportional to each lattice point (entry in the contact
matrix). The results show clear boundaries between identified domains and the
background. These domain boundaries are dependent on the coupling constant, so
that one matrix yields several clusters of different sizes, which show the
self-interaction of the genome on different scales.

modern automobile systems. However, the current automotive safety standard ISO
26262 does not specify clearly the methods for safety analysis. Different
methods are recommended for this purpose. FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and FMEA
(Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) are used in the most recent ISO 26262
applications to identify component failures, errors and faults that lead to
specific hazards (in the presence of faults). However, these methods are based
on reliability theory, and they are not adequate to address new hazards caused
by dysfunctional component interactions, software failure or human error. A
holistic approach was developed called STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process
Analysis) which addresses more types of hazards and treats safety as a dynamic
control problem rather than an individual component failure. STPA also
addresses types of hazardous causes in the absence of failure. Accordingly,
there is a need for investigating hazard analysis techniques like STPA. In this
paper, we present a concept on how to use STPA to extend the safety scope of
ISO 26262 and support the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessments (HARA) process.
We applied the proposed concept to a current project of a fully automated
vehicle at Continental. As a result, we identified 24 system- level accidents,
176 hazards, 27 unsafe control actions, and 129 unsafe scenarios. We conclude
that STPA is an effective and efficient approach to derive detailed safety
constraints. STPA can support the functional safety engineers to evaluate the
architectural design of fully automated vehicles and build the functional
safety concept.

coherence in noise on the error threshold without any approximation. The result
shows that the error threshold becomes one third when noise is fully coherent.
Our scheme is also applicable to the surface code undergoing a specific
coherent noise model. The dependence of the error threshold on noise coherence
can be explained with a leading-order analysis with respect to coherence terms
in the noise map. We expect that this analysis is also valid for the surface
code since it is a two-dimensional extension of the one-dimensional repetition
code. Moreover, since the obtained threshold is accurate, our results can be
used as a benchmark for approximation or heuristic schemes for non-Clifford
noise.

a poor local optima due to its non-convex and multiple local minima

solve the DED-VPE without transmission loss, yielding a good initial point for
IPM to improve the quality of the solution. Simulation results demonstrate the

  Control","Submitted to IEEE Control Systems Letters",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider distributed control of double-integrator networks, where agents
are subject to stochastic disturbances. We study performance of such networks
in terms of coherence, defined through an H2 norm metric that represents the
variance of nodal state fluctuations. Specifically, we address known
performance limitations of the standard consensus protocol, which cause this
variance to scale unboundedly with network size for a large class of networks.
We propose distributed proportional integral (PI) and proportional derivative
(PD) controllers that relax these limitations and achieve bounded variance, in
cases where agents can access an absolute measurement of one of their states.
This case applies to, for example, frequency control of power networks and
vehicular formation control with limited sensing. We discuss optimal tuning of
the controllers with respect to network coherence and demonstrate our results
in simulations.

instability includes umklapp scattering, leading to an energy gap not only in
the single particle spectrum but also in the pair spectrum. As a result the

horizon by a reflective surface. Objects with these properties are prone to the
so-called ergoregion instability when they spin sufficiently fast. We
investigate in detail a simple model consisting of scalar perturbations of a
Kerr geometry with a reflective surface near the horizon. The instability
depends on the spin, on the compactness, and on the reflectivity at the
surface. The instability time scale increases only logarithmically in the
black-hole limit and, for a perfectly reflecting object, this is not enough to
prevent the instability from occurring on dynamical time scales. However, we
find that an absorption rate at the surface as small as 0.4% (reflectivity
coefficient as large as $|{\cal R}|^2=0.996$) is sufficient to quench the
instability completely. Our results suggest that exotic compact objects are not
necessarily ruled out by the ergoregion instability.

understanding the solar dynamo. In this paper, we validate a recently developed
method for obtaining sensitivity functions (kernels) for travel-time
measurements to solar interior flows using the Born approximation in spherical
geometry, which is expected to be more accurate than the classical ray
approximation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical approach to efficiently
compute a large number of kernels based on the separability of the
eigenfunctions into their horizontal and radial dependence. The validation is
performed using a hydrodynamic simulation of linear wave propagation in the
Sun, which includes a standard single-cell meridional flow profile. We show
that, using the Born approximation, it is possible to accurately model
observational quantities relevant for time-distance helioseismology such as the
mean power spectrum, disc-averaged cross-covariance functions, and travel times
in the presence of a flow field. In order to closely match the model to
observations, we show that it is beneficial to use mode frequencies and damping
rates which were extracted from the measured power spectrum. Furthermore, the
contribution of the radial flow to the total travel time is found to reach 20%
of the contribution of the horizontal flow at travel distances over $40^\circ$.
Using the Born kernels and a 2D SOLA inversion of travel times, we can recover
most features of the input meridional flow profile. The Born approximation is
thus a promising method for inferring large-scale solar interior flows.

Namely, define the eigenvalue as real first, and, meanwhile, open the boundary

in meaning. This eigenfunction is generally divergent, and the extent and
direction of divergence are closely linked to the energy. It was noted that
these divergent behaviors can be well described by their energy-space

unstable and will certainly exchange energy with the outside. The mechanism of
energy exchange is just in the energy-space uncertainty relation, which will
benefit dynamic simulation, the many-body problem, and so on. There is no

down both the classical and the quantum synchronizations from an angle of
quantum control. The classical synchronization and the relevant dynamics of
measure synchronization, the quantum synchronization and two different types of

and the microscopic signatures of synchronized behaviors in a closed quantum

fluctuations beyond the classical mean-value dynamics due to long-lasting mode
coherence discriminates the quantum synchronization from the classical one,
which not only excludes the possibilities of an exact synchronization and a
perfect density overlap in phase space, but also leads to upper limitations to
Mari measure and large unceasing fluctuations to mutual information between two
scattering modes. We reveal a close dynamic connection between Mari measure and
the mutual information of two nonlinear momentum modes in closed BEC systems by
demonstrating an opposite mean-value behavior but a similar fluctuation
variation with respect to their respective evolutionary scales.

Universe, which evolves to an ekpyrotic phase. After the bounce the Universe
enters in the expanding phase, where the orbits leave the ekpyrotic regime
going to a kination (also named deflationary) regime. Moreover, this scenario
supports the production of heavy massive particles conformally coupled with
gravity, which reheats the universe at temperatures compatible with the
nucleosynthesis bounds and also the production of massless particles
non-conformally coupled with gravity leading to very high reheating
temperatures but ensuring the nucleosynthesis success. Dealing with
cosmological perturbations, these background dynamics produce a nearly scale

Recent work on explanations for black-box models has produced tools (e.g. LIME)

models are right for the wrong reasons. However, these methods do not scale to
explaining entire datasets and cannot correct the problems they reveal. We
introduce a method for efficiently explaining and regularizing differentiable

provide a normal to the decision boundary. We apply these penalties both based

columns of the periodic table form body centered cubic (BCC) structures.
Elements from the Ti column are noteworthy because they take the BCC structure
at high temperature but undergo a shear instability and transform to the
hexagonal (HCP) structure at low temperature. We show that the instability of
these elements impacts the properties of the HEAs that contain them. In
particular, the shear moduli are greatly reduced, causing increased dynamic
contributions to lattice distortion. Relatively large size differences between
elements of the BCC/HCP column compared with the regular BCC columns create
additional static contributions to lattice distortion. These findings are
supported by direct evaluation of elastic constants and lattice distortion in
four representative HEAs. Comparing moduli of HEAs with those of
compositionally averaged pure elements verifies the impact of BCC/HCP elements
and allows us to estimate the compositions at which the BCC phases become
elastically unstable, predictions that could be useful in material design.

light curves, which reveal the first detection of mid-IR variability from a
ULX, is determined to arise primarily from dust emission rather than from a jet
or an accretion disk outflow. We derived the evolution of the dust temperature
($T_\mathrm{d}\sim600 - 800$ K), IR luminosity ($L_\mathrm{IR}\sim3\times10^4$

attribute the mid-IR variability of X-1 to increased heating of dust located in
a circumbinary torus. It is unclear what physical processes are responsible for
the increased dust heating; however, it does not appear to be associated with
the X-ray flux from the ULX given the constant X-ray luminosities provided by
serendipitous, near-contemporaneous X-ray observations around the first mid-IR

described as volume- and gradient-energy contributions of the set of fields,
respectively. Time and space are formulated as background-independent dynamic
variables. The evolution equations of the body of the universe are derived from
first principles of thermodynamics. Gravitational interaction emerges from
quantum fluctuations in finite space. Application to a large number of fields
predicts scale separation in space and repulsive action of masses distant
beyond a marginal distance. The predicted marginal distance is compared to the
size of the voids in the observable universe.

a way solving the hierarchy problem. For this, the SM effective action in flat
spacetime is adapted to curved spacetime via not only the general covariance
but also the gauge invariance. For the latter, gauge field hard masses, induced
by loops at the UV scale $\Lambda$, are dispelled by construing $\Lambda$ as
the constant value assigned to curvature. This gives way to an unprecedented
mechanism for incorporating gravity into the SM in that the hierarchy problem
is solved by transmutation of the Higgs boson $\Lambda^2$--mass into the
Higgs-curvature coupling, and the cosmological constant problem is alleviated
by metamorphosis of the vacuum $\Lambda^4$--energy into the Einstein-Hilbert
term. Gravity emerges correctly if the SM is accompanied by a secluded dark
sector sourcing non-interacting dark matter, dark energy and dark radiation.
Physics beyond the SM, containing Higgs-phobic scalars that resolve the strong
CP problem, flavor problem, baryogenesis and inflation, respects the hierarchy.
Majorana neutrinos are naturally incorporated if $\Lambda$ lies at the see-saw
scale. This mechanism, in general, leaves no compelling reason to anticipate
new particles at the LHC or higher-energy colliders.

spin motions, separating the octonion angular momentum of a proton into six
components, elucidating the proton angular momentum in the proton spin puzzle,
especially the proton spin, decomposition, quarks and gluons, and polarization
and so forth. J. C. Maxwell was the first to use the quaternions to study the
electromagnetic fields. Subsequently the complex octonions are utilized to
depict the electromagnetic field, gravitational field, and quantum mechanics
and so forth. In the complex octonion space, the precessional equilibrium
equation infers the angular velocity of precession. The external
electromagnetic strength may induce a new precessional motion, generating a new
term of angular momentum, even if the orbital angular momentum is zero. This
new term of angular momentum can be regarded as the spin angular momentum, and
its angular velocity of precession is different from the angular velocity of
revolution. The study reveals that the angular momentum of the proton must be
separated into more components than ever before. In the proton spin puzzle, the
orbital angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment are independent of each
other, and they should be measured and calculated respectively.

of the electron (eEDM) is presented. The approach uses a (two-component)
complex generalized Hartree-Fock (cGHF) and a complex generalized Kohn-Sham
(cGKS) scheme within the zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA). In
applications to select heavy-elemental polar diatomic molecular radicals, which
are promising candidates for an eEDM experiment, the method is compared to
relativistic four-component electron-correlation calculations and confirms
values for the effective electrical field acting on the unpaired electron for
RaF, BaF, YbF and HgF. The calculations show that purely relativistic effects,
involving only the lower component of the Dirac bi-spinor, are well described
by treating only the upper component explicitly.

Schwinger effect when the pair moves transverse to the plasma wind rather than

induced by the intense THz pulse. P-doped CVD graphene with the initial Fermi
energy of about 200 meV was used, optical photons was detected in the
wavelength range of 340-600 nm. Emission started when THz field amplitude
exceeded 100 kV/cm. For THz fields from 200 to 300 kV/cm the temperature of
optical radiation was constant, while the number of emitted photons increased
several dozen times. This fact clearly indicates multiplication of
electron-hole pairs induced by an external field itself and not due to electron
heating. The experimental data are in a good agreement with the theory of
Landau-Zener interband transitions. It is shown theoretically that Landau-Zener
transitions are possible even in the case of heavily doped graphene because the
strong THz field removes quasiparticles from the region of interband
transitions during several femtoseconds, which cancels the Pauli blocking
effect.

complex networks that are based on the presence of certain substructures
composed of specific nodes. Rich-club ordering represents the tendency of
highly connected and important elements to form tight communities with other
central elements. The dyadic effect denotes the tendency of nodes that share a
common property to be much more interconnected than expected. In this study, we
consider the interrelation between these two phenomena, which until now have
always been studied separately. We contribute with a new formulation of the
rich-club measures in terms of the dyadic effect. Moreover, we introduce
certain measures related to the analysis of the dyadic effect, which are useful
in confirming the presence and relevance of rich-clubs in complex networks. In
addition, certain computational experiences show the usefulness of the
introduced quantities with regard to different classes of real networks.
