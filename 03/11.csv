  faster algorithms","To appear in SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications",,,,"cs.SC cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For matrices with displacement structure, basic operations like
multiplication, inversion, and linear system solving can all be expressed in
terms of the following task: evaluate the product $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{B}$, where
$\mathsf{A}$ is a structured $n \times n$ matrix of displacement rank $\alpha$,
and $\mathsf{B}$ is an arbitrary $n\times\alpha$ matrix. Given $\mathsf{B}$ and
a so-called ""generator"" of $\mathsf{A}$, this product is classically computed
with a cost ranging from $O(\alpha^2 \mathscr{M}(n))$ to $O(\alpha^2
\mathscr{M}(n)\log(n))$ arithmetic operations, depending on the type of
structure of $\mathsf{A}$; here, $\mathscr{M}$ is a cost function for
polynomial multiplication. In this paper, we first generalize classical
displacement operators, based on block diagonal matrices with companion
diagonal blocks, and then design fast algorithms to perform the task above for
this extended class of structured matrices. The cost of these algorithms ranges
from $O(\alpha^{\omega-1} \mathscr{M}(n))$ to $O(\alpha^{\omega-1}
\mathscr{M}(n)\log(n))$, with $\omega$ such that two $n \times n$ matrices over
a field can be multiplied using $O(n^\omega)$ field operations. By combining
this result with classical randomized regularization techniques, we obtain
faster Las Vegas algorithms for structured inversion and linear system solving.

detection of topological edge states arising at the boundary because the
distortion fuses the edge states into the bulk. We propose experimentally
feasible protocols to probe localized edge states and dimerization of ultracold
fermions. By confining cold-atoms in a ring lattice and changing the boundary
condition from periodic to open using an off-resonant laser sheet to cut open
the ring, topological edge states can be generated. A lattice in a topological
configuration can trap a single particle released at the edge as the system
evolves in time. Alternatively, depleting an initially filled lattice away from
the boundary reveals the occupied edge states. Signatures of dimerization in
the presence of contact interactions can be found in selected correlations as
the system boundary suddenly changes from periodic to open and exhibit memory
effects of the initial state distinguishing different configurations or phases.

operation was maintained for a total of 126.6 days. By applying time
information to emulsion films, various results were obtained. Time resolutions
of 5.3 to 14.7 s were evaluated in an operation spanning 46.9 days (time
resolved numbers of 3.8--1.4$\times10^{5}$). By using timing and spatial

multiplicity events and vertex events, including neutrino events was performed.
Emulsion events were matched to events observed by INGRID, one of near

analysis was established via use of the multi-stage shifter. The results
demonstrate that the multi-stage shifter is feasible for use in neutrino

assumed vertical location of the CH$_3$OH molecular layer. In this study, we
use a thermo-chemical model of the TW Hya disc, coupled with the ALCHEMIC
gas-grain chemical model, assuming laboratory-motivated, fast diffusivities of
the surface molecules to interpret the CH$_3$OH detection. Based on this disc
model, we performed radiative transfer calculations with the LIME code and
simulations of the observations with the CASA simulator. We found that our
model allows to reproduce the observations well. The CH$_3$OH emission in our
model appears as a ring with radius of $\sim60$ au. Synthetic and observed line
flux densities are equal within the rms noise level of observations. The
synthetic CH$_3$OH spectra calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium

strongest lines, the differences between LTE and non-LTE flux densities are
very small and practically negligible. Variations in the diffusivity of the

catalogues. It is crucial that the correct objects be paired, and that their
photometry does not suffer from any spurious additional flux. We compare the
positions of sources in WISE, IPHAS, 2MASS, and APASS with Gaia DR1 astrometric
positions. We find that the separations are described by a combination of a
Gaussian distribution, wider than naively assumed based on their quoted
uncertainties, and a large wing, which some authors ascribe to proper motions.
We show that this is caused by flux contamination from blended stars not
treated separately. We provide linear fits between the quoted Gaussian
uncertainty and the core fit to the separation distributions.
  We show that at least one in three of the stars in the faint half of a given
catalogue will suffer from flux contamination above the 1% level when the
density of catalogue objects per PSF area is above approximately 0.005. This
has important implications for the creation of composite catalogues. It is
important for any closest neighbour matches as there will be a given fraction
of matches that are flux contaminated, while some matches will be missed due to
significant astrometric perturbation by faint contaminants. In the case of
probability-based matching, this contamination affects the probability density
function of matches as a function of distance. This effect results in up to 50%
fewer counterparts being returned as matches, assuming Gaussian astrometric
uncertainties for WISE-Gaia matching in crowded Galactic plane regions,

  Evaluation",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Five year post-transplant survival rate is an important indicator on quality
of care delivered by kidney transplant centers in the United States. To provide
a fair assessment of each transplant center, an effect that represents the
center-specific care quality, along with patient level risk factors, is often
included in the risk adjustment model. In the past, the center effects have
been modeled as either fixed effects or Gaussian random effects, with various
pros and cons. Our numerical analyses reveal that the distributional
assumptions do impact the prediction of center effects especially when the
effect is extreme. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, we propose
to model the transplant center effect as a latent random variable with a finite
Gaussian mixture distribution. Such latent Gaussian mixture models provide a
convenient framework to study the heterogeneity among the transplant centers.
To overcome the weak identifiability issues, we propose to estimate the latent
Gaussian mixture model using a penalized likelihood approach, and develop
sequential locally restricted likelihood ratio tests to determine the number of

secure against quantum adversaries is not a straightforward transposition of
the classical case, among other reasons due to the difficulty to use rewinding
in the quantum realm. We introduce a Quantum Computation Cut-and-Choose (QC-CC)
technique which is a generalisation of the classical Cut-and-Choose in order to
build quantum protocols secure against quantum covert adversaries. Such
adversaries can deviate arbitrarily provided that their deviation is not
detected. As an application of the QC-CC we give a protocol for securely
performing two-party quantum computation with classical input/output. As basis
we use secure delegated quantum computing (Broadbent et al 2009), and in
particular the garbled quantum computation of (Kashefi et al 2016) that is
secure against only a weak specious adversaries, defined in (Dupuis et al
2010). A unique property of these protocols is the separation between classical
and quantum communications and the asymmetry between client and server, which
enables us to sidestep the quantum rewinding issues. This opens the prospect of
using the QC-CC to other quantum protocols with this separation. In our proof
of security we adapt and use (at different parts) two quantum rewinding
techniques, namely Watrous' oblivious q-rewinding (Watrous 2009) and Unruh's
special q-rewinding (Unruh 2012). Our protocol achieves the same functionality
as in previous works (e.g. Dupuis et al 2012), however using the QC-CC
technique on the protocol from (Kashefi et al 2016) leads to the following key
improvements: (i) only one-way offline quantum communication is necessary ,
(ii) only one party (server) needs to have involved quantum technological
abilities, (iii) only minimal extra cryptographic primitives are required,
namely one oblivious transfer for each input bit and quantum-safe commitments.

  semiconductors: illumination as a method to enhance p-type doping",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Undesired unintentional doping and doping limits in semiconductors are
typically caused by compensating defects with low formation energies. Since the
formation energy of a charged defect depends linearly on the Fermi level,
doping limits can be especially pronounced in wide bandgap semiconductors where
the Fermi level can vary substantially. Introduction of non-equilibrium carrier
concentrations during growth or processing alters the chemical potentials of
band carriers and thus provides the possibility of modifying populations of
charged defects in ways impossible at thermal equilibrium. Herein we
demonstrate that, for an ergodic system with excess carriers, the rates of
carrier capture and emission involving a defect charge transition level
rigorously determine the admixture of electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels
determining the formation energy of non-zero charge states of that defect type.
To catalog the range of possible responses to excess carriers, we investigate
the behavior of a single donor-like defect as functions of extrinsic doping and
energy of the charge transition level. The technologically most important
finding is that excess carriers will increase the formation energy of
compensating defects for most values of the charge transition level in the
bandgap. Thus, it may be possible to overcome limitations on doping imposed by
native defects. Cases also exist in wide bandgap semiconductors in which the
concentration of defects with the same charge polarity as the majority dopant
is either left unchanged or actually increases. The causes of these various
behaviors are rationalized in terms of the capture and emission rates and
guidelines for carrying out experimental tests of this model are given.

equilibrium properties of the bath can be well-defined, even when the system is
arbitrarily far from equilibrium and correlated with the bath. These states,
which retain a notion of temperature, take the form of conditional equilibrium
distributions. For out-of-equilibrium processes we show that the average
entropy production quantifies the extent to which the system-bath state is
driven away from the conditional equilibrium distribution. In addition, we show
that the stochastic entropy production satisfies a generalised Crooks relation
and can be used to quantify time-asymmetry of correlated non-equilibrium
processes. These results naturally extend the familiar properties of entropy
production in weakly-coupled systems to the strong coupling regime.
Experimental measurements of the entropy production at strong coupling could be
pursued using optomechanics or trapped ion systems, which allow strong coupling

simultaneously also determine the concentrations of the permeating ions inside

these and the independent variables are not taken into account, and the
intracellular concentrations are treated like additional independent variables.
The ""causal"" theory presented here leads to a simple formula for the resting

Na,K-pump and carrier transport) and the membrane permeabilities for sodium and
potassium ions. In addition it leads to two results not obtained in the

the BPHZ R-operation, which subtracts both ultraviolet and infrared divergences
of euclidean Feynman graphs with non-exceptional external momenta. It can be
used to compute the divergent parts of such Feynman graphs from products of
simpler Feynman graphs of lower loops. In this paper we extend the R*-operation
to Feynman graphs with arbitrary numerators, including tensors. We also provide
a novel way of defining infrared counterterms which closely resembles the
definition of its ultraviolet counterpart. We further express both infrared and
ultraviolet counterterms in terms of scaleless vacuum graphs with a logarithmic
degree of divergence. By exploiting symmetries, integrand and integral
relations, which the counterterms of scaleless vacuum graphs satisfy, we can
vastly reduce their number and complexity. A FORM implementation of this method
was used to compute the five loop beta function in QCD for a general gauge
group. To illustrate the procedure, we compute the poles in the dimensional
regulator of all top-level propagator graphs at five loops in four dimensional
phi^3 theory.

from biophysical phenomena. In most vertebrate systems, precise functions are
assigned at the level of neural populations, while single-neurons are deemed
unreliable and redundant. Here we challenge this view and show that many
single-neuron quantities, including voltages, firing thresholds, excitation,
inhibition, and spikes, acquire precise functional meaning whenever a network
learns to transmit information parsimoniously and precisely to the next layer.
Based on the hypothesis that neural circuits generate precise population codes
under severe constraints on metabolic costs, we derive synaptic plasticity
rules that allow a network to represent its time-varying inputs with maximal
accuracy. We provide exact solutions to the learnt optimal states, and we
predict the properties of an entire network from its input distribution and the
cost of activity. Single-neuron variability and tuning curves as typically
observed in cortex emerge over the course of learning, but paradoxically
coincide with a precise, non-redundant spike-based population code. Our work
suggests that neural circuits operate far more accurately than previously
thought, and that no spike is fired in vain.

CO$_2$, CO, and solar induced fluorescence (SIF) are ingested into a
4D-variational assimilation system driven by carbon cycle models to infer
spatially resolved carbon fluxes including net ecosystem exchange, biomass
burning, and gross primary productivity (GPP). The global net carbon flux
tendency, which is the flux difference 2011-2010 and is positive for net fluxes
into the atmosphere, was estimated to be -1.60 PgC between 2011-2010 while the
Brazilian tendency was -0.24 $\pm$ 0.11 PgC. This estimate is broadly within
the uncertainty of previous aircraft based estimates restricted to the
Amazonian basin. The biomass burning tendency in Brazil was -0.24 $\pm$ 0.036
PgC, which implies a near-zero change of the net ecosystem production (NEP).
The near-zero change of the NEP is the result of quantitatively comparable
increase in GPP (0.34 $\pm$ 0.20) and respiration in Brazil. Comparisons of the
component fluxes in Brazil to the global fluxes show a complex balance between
regional contributions to individual carbon fluxes such as biomass burning, and
their net contribution to the global carbon balance, i.e., the Brazilian
biomass burning tendency is a significant contributor to the global biomass
burning tendency but the Brazilian net flux tendency is not a dominant
contributor to the global tendency. These results show the potential of
multiple satellite observations to help quantify the spatially resolved
response of productivity and respiration fluxes to climate variability.

performed ultrafast femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy on thin film black
phosphorus mechanically exfoliated on a glass substrate. Carriers (electrons
and holes) were excited to high energy levels and the process of carrier
relaxation through phonon emission and recombination was probed. We used a wide
range of probing wavelengths up to and across the band gap to study the
evolution of the relaxation dynamics at different energy levels. Our
experiments revealed a plethora of important physical phenomena. The fast
relaxation time constants, associated with carrier-phonon scattering, steadily
increase as the energy of the probe beam approaches the band gap energy, which
was determined to be 0.31 eV, and the carrier recombination rate was obtained
when the probe wavelength was tuned to match the band gap energy. The
carrier-phonon scattering rates were found to be similar along the armchair and
zigzag directions, therefore, the anisotropic carrier mobility reported in
literature is mainly due to the difference in effective mass of carriers along
different directions. The ultrafast spectroscopy data further revealed the
oxidation induced surface charges. Our results highlight the importance of
using the spectroscopy technique, in this case, in the mid-IR range, to uncover

scalar degree of freedom, can be conveniently described within the framework of
the Effective Theory of Dark Energy, based on the unitary gauge where the
scalar field is uniform. We extend this effective approach by allowing the
Lagrangian in unitary gauge to depend on the time derivative of the lapse
function. Although this dependence generically signals the presence of an extra
scalar degree of freedom, theories that contain only one propagating scalar
degree of freedom, in addition to the usual tensor modes, can be constructed by
requiring the initial Lagrangian to be degenerate. Starting from a general
quadratic action, we derive the dispersion relations for the linear
perturbations around Minkowski and a cosmological background. Our analysis
directly applies to the recently introduced Degenerate Higher-Order
Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories. For these theories, we find that one cannot
recover a Poisson-like equation in the static linear regime except for the
subclass that includes the Horndeski and so-called ""beyond Horndeski"" theories.
We also discuss Lorentz-breaking models inspired by Horava gravity.

forming the massive black holes powering bright quasars observed in the early

massive) Population III stars be avoided - this can be achieved by destroying
H$_2$ via Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation (E$_{\rm{LW}}$ = 12.6 eV). We find that
two conditions must be met in the proto-galaxy that will host the DCBH. First,
prior star formation must be delayed; this can be achieved with a background LW
flux of J$_{\rm BG} \gtrsim 100\ J_{21}$. Second, an intense burst of LW
radiation from a neighbouring star-bursting proto-galaxy is required, just
before the gas cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, to finally suppress star
formation completely. We show here for the first time using high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulations, including full radiative transfer, that this
low-level background, combined with tight synchronisation and irradiation of a
secondary proto-galaxy by a primary proto-galaxy, inevitably moves the
secondary proto-galaxy onto the isothermal atomic cooling track, without the
deleterious effects of either photo-evaporating the gas or polluting it by
heavy elements. These, atomically cooled, massive proto-galaxies are expected
to ultimately form a DCBH of mass $10^4 - 10^5 M_{\odot}$.

for typical dark matter halos in $\Lambda$CDM. Cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations have recently reproduced this similarity in large galaxy samples by
including strong galactic winds, but the exact mechanism that achieves this is
not yet clear. Here we present an analysis of key aspects contributing to this
relation: angular momentum selection and evolution of Lagrangian mass elements
as they accrete onto dark matter halos, condense into Milky Way-scale galaxies,
and join the $z=0$ stellar phase. We contrast this evolution in the Illustris
simulation with that in a simulation without galactic winds, where the $z=0$
angular momentum is $\approx0.6$ dex lower. We find that winds induce
differences between these simulations in several ways: increasing angular
momentum, preventing angular momentum loss, and causing $z=0$ stars to sample
the accretion-time angular momentum distribution of baryons in a biased way. In
both simulations, gas loses on average $\approx0.4$ dex between accreting onto
halos and first accreting onto central galaxies. In Illustris, this is followed
by $\approx0.2$ dex gains in the `galactic wind fountain' and no further net
evolution past the final accretion onto the galaxy. Without feedback, further
losses of $\approx0.2$ dex occur in the gas phase inside the galaxies. An
additional $\approx0.15$ dex difference arises from feedback preferentially
selecting higher angular momentum gas at accretion by expelling gas that is
poorly aligned. These and additional effects of similar magnitude are
discussed, suggesting a complex origin of the similarity between the specific
angular momenta of galactic disks and typical halos.

it is unlikely based on imaging, integral-field spectroscopy, and high-$z$
massive galaxy pair statistics. We argue that the gas seen in absorption
against the QSO was likely ejected from the galaxy J1439B and therefore
provides a unique observational probe of AGN feedback in the distant universe.

can alleviate the Too Big To Fail problem (TBTF) for late-type galaxies, which
states that isolated dwarf galaxy kinematics imply that dwarfs live in
lower-mass halos than is expected in a {\Lambda}CDM universe. Furthermore, we
want to explain this apparent tension between theory and observations. To do
this, we use the MoRIA suite of dwarf galaxy simulations to investigate whether
observational effects are involved in TBTF for late-type field dwarf galaxies.
To this end, we create synthetic radio data cubes of the simulated MoRIA
galaxies and analyse their HI kinematics as if they were real, observed
galaxies. We find that for low-mass galaxies, the circular velocity profile
inferred from the HI kinematics often underestimates the true circular velocity
profile, as derived directly from the enclosed mass. Fitting the HI kinematics
of MoRIA dwarfs with a theoretical halo profile results in a systematic
underestimate of the mass of their host halos. We attribute this effect to the
fact that the interstellar medium of a low-mass late-type dwarf is continuously
stirred by supernova explosions into a vertically puffed-up, turbulent state to
the extent that the rotation velocity of the gas is simply no longer a good
tracer of the underlying gravitational force field. If this holds true for real
dwarf galaxies as well, it implies that they inhabit more massive dark matter
halos than would be inferred from their kinematics, solving TBTF for late-type
field dwarf galaxies.

diagnostics (R23 and O3N2 for metallicity and N2O2 for N/O) and referencing to
the effective (half-light) radius ($\rm R_e$), we find that the metallicity
gradient steepens with stellar mass, lying roughly flat among galaxies with
$\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 9.0$ but exhibiting slopes as steep as -0.14 dex
$\rm R_e^{-1}$ at $\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.5$ (using R23, but equivalent
results are obtained using O3N2). At higher masses, these slopes remain typical
in the outer regions of our sample ($\rm R > 1.5 ~R_e$), but a flattening is
observed in the central regions ($\rm R < 1~ R_e$). In the outer regions ($\rm
R > 2.0 ~R_e$) we detect a mild flattening of the metallicity gradient in
stacked profiles, although with low significance. The N/O ratio gradient
provides complementary constraints on the average chemical enrichment history.
Unlike the oxygen abundance, the average N/O profiles do not flatten out in the
central regions of massive galaxies. The metallicity and N/O profiles both
depart significantly from an exponential form, suggesting a disconnect between
chemical enrichment and stellar mass surface density on local scales. In the
context of inside-out growth of discs, our findings suggest that central
regions of massive galaxies today have evolved to an equilibrium metallicity,
while the nitrogen abundance continues to increase as a consequence of delayed
secondary nucleosynthetic production.

state: In these systems, the charge pumped during each pumping cycle is
quantized and coincides with the Chern invariant. However, differently from
quantum Hall insulators, quantum pumps can exhibit novel phenomena such as the
fractional quantization of the charge transport, as a consequence of their
distinctive symmetries in parameter space. Here, we report the analogous
fractional quantization of the spin transport in a topological spin pump
realized in a one-dimensional lattice via a periodically modulated Zeeman
field. In the proposed model, which is a spinfull generalization of the
Harper-Hofstadter model, the amount of spin current pumped during well-defined
fractions of the pumping cycle is quantized as fractions of the spin Chern
number. This fractional quantization of spin is topological, and is a direct
consequence of the additional symmetries ensuing from the commensuration of the
periodic field with the underlying lattice.

produces a cascade of first- and second- order phase transitions between the
paramagnetic and the spiral states upon temperature decreasing. Depending on
system parameters, the following intermediate phases can arise: an
incommensurate and a commensurate sinusoidally modulated states, spiral phases
in which perpendicular spin components have different amplitudes and are
modulated with the same and with different wave vectors. We distinguish six
possible sequences of phase transitions upon temperature decreasing at least
four of which were observed before experimentally in specific compounds. It is
found that the action of dipolar forces cannot always be modeled even
qualitatively by small one-ion anisotropic spin interactions. We demonstrate
that the dipolar interaction is responsible for successive phase transitions in
the triangular-lattice multiferroic MnI$_2$: almost all available experimental
findings are described quantitatively within the mean-field theory by taking
into account the exchange, the dipolar and small symmetry-allowed anisotropic
spin interactions.

and depth of field (DOF). To increase resolution, high numerical apertures (NA)
are needed, but the associated large angular uncertainty results in a limited
range of depths that can be put in sharp focus. Plenoptic imaging was
introduced a few years ago to remedy this trade off. To this aim, plenoptic
imaging reconstructs the path of light rays from the lens to the sensor.
However, the improvement offered by standard plenoptic imaging is practical and
not fundamental: the increased DOF leads to a proportional reduction of the
resolution well above the diffraction limit imposed by the lens NA. In this
paper, we demonstrate that correlation measurements enable pushing plenoptic
imaging to its fundamental limits of both resolution and DOF. Namely, we
demonstrate to maintain the imaging resolution at the diffraction limit while
increasing the depth of field by a factor of 7. Our results represent the
theoretical and experimental basis for the effective development of the
promising applications of plenoptic imaging.

spin ice (QSI) by means of inelastic light scattering. In particular, we are
interested in the Raman response of the fractionalized U(1) spin liquid
realized in the XXZ QSI. We show that the low-energy Raman intensity is
dominated by spinon and gauge fluctuations. We find that the Raman response in
the QSI state of that model appears only in the $T_{2g}$ polarization channel.
We show that the Raman intensity profile displays a broad continuum from the
spinons and coupled spinon and gauge fluctuations, and a low-energy peak
arising entirely from gauge fluctuations. Both features originate from the
exotic interaction between photon and the fractionalized excitations of QSI.
Our theoretical results suggest that inelastic Raman scattering can in
principle serve as a promising experimental probe of the nature of a U(1) spin
liquid in QSI.

variations in the $g$-factors of one-electron and three-electron spin qubits

likely due to their varying sensitivity to charge noise, resulting from

that by employing the anisotropic nature of the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in

previous works (Formaggia et al. 2013, Porta et al., 2014) we assumed a
simplified depositional history with only one material, in this work we
consider multi-layered basins, in which each layer is characterized by a
different material, and hence by different properties. This setting requires
several improvements with respect to our earlier works, both concerning the
deterministic solver and the stochastic discretization. On the deterministic
side, we replace the previous fixed-point iterative solver with a more
efficient Newton solver at each step of the time-discretization. On the
stochastic side, the multi-layered structure gives rise to discontinuities in
the dependence of the state variables on the uncertain parameters, that need an
appropriate treatment for surrogate modeling techniques, such as sparse grids,
to be effective. We propose an innovative methodology to this end which relies
on a change of coordinate system to align the discontinuities of the target
function within the random parameter space. The reference coordinate system is
built upon exploiting physical features of the problem at hand. We employ the
locations of material interfaces, which display a smooth dependence on the
random parameters and are therefore amenable to sparse grid polynomial
approximations. We showcase the capabilities of our numerical methodologies
through two synthetic test cases. In particular, we show that our methodology
reproduces with high accuracy multi-modal probability density functions

integrable stochastic interacting particle system on the continuous half line

of arbitrary spatial inhomogeneity on the half line which does not break the
integrability. We completely characterize the macroscopic limit shape and
asymptotic fluctuations of the height function (= integrated current) in the
model. In particular, we explain how the presence of inhomogeneity may lead to
macroscopic phase transitions in the limit shape such as shocks or traffic
jams. Away from these singularities the asymptotic fluctuations of the height
function around its macroscopic limit shape are governed by the GUE Tracy-Widom
distribution. A surprising result is that while the limit shape is
discontinuous at a traffic jam caused by a macroscopic slowdown in the
inhomogeneity, fluctuations on both sides of such a traffic jam still have the
GUE Tracy-Widom distribution (but with different non-universal normalizations).
  The integrability of the model comes from the fact that it is a degeneration
of the inhomogeneous stochastic higher spin six vertex models studied earlier
in arXiv:1601.05770 [math.PR]. Our results on fluctuations are obtained via an
asymptotic analysis of Fredholm determinantal formulas arising from contour
integral expressions for the q-moments in the stochastic higher spin six vertex
model. We also discuss ""product-form"" translation invariant stationary
distributions of the exponential jump model which lead to an alternative
hydrodynamic-type heuristic derivation of the macroscopic limit shape.

a complex network of interactions among individual elements probabilistically

of the stochastic rules, the ability to predict system configurations is
generally characterized by a large uncertainty. Selecting a fraction of the

unobserved nodes. However, choosing these points of observation in an optimal
way is a highly nontrivial task, depending on the nature of the stochastic

quasioptimal solutions to the problem. The method leverages network sparsity to
reduce computational complexity from exponential to almost quadratic, thus
allowing the straightforward application of the method to mid-to-large-size

different networks are designed to perform depth estimation, each of them
suitable for a feature level. Networks with different pooling sizes determine
different feature levels. After designing a set of networks, these models may

This ""Semi Parallel Deep Neural Network (SPDNN)"" eliminates duplicated common

facilitate accurate visualization and localization of tumors. Typically, such
markers are used to aid daily patient positioning and to verify the target's
position during treatment. This work introduces a novel, automated method for
identifying fiducial markers in planar x-ray imaging.
  Methods: In brief, the method consists of automated filtration and
reconstruction steps that generate 3D templates of marker positions. The
normalized cross-correlation was the used to identify fiducial markers in
projection images. To quantify the accuracy of the technique, a phantom study
was performed. 75 pre-treatment CBCT scans of 15 pancreatic cancer patients
were analyzed to test the automated technique under real life conditions,
including several challenging scenarios for tracking fiducial markers.
  Results: In phantom and patient studies, the method automatically tracked
visible marker clusters in 100% of projection images. For scans in which a
phantom exhibited 0D, 1D, and 3D motion, the automated technique showed median
errors of 39 $\mu$m, 53 $\mu$m, and 93 $\mu$m, respectively. Human precision
was worse in comparison. Automated tracking was performed accurately despite
the presence of other metallic objects. Additionally, transient differences in
the cross-correlation score identified instances where markers disappeared from
view.
  Conclusions: A novel, automated method for producing dynamic templates of
fiducial marker clusters has been developed. Production of these templates
automatically provides measurements of tumor motion that occurred during the
CBCT scan that was used to produce them. Additionally, using these templates
with intra-fractional images could potentially allow for more robust real-time
target tracking in radiotherapy.

advantage of Cassini's presence at ~10 AU to explore the importance of
whistler-mode waves in a parameter regime typically characterized by higher
Mach number (median of ~14) shocks, as well as a significantly different IMF
structure, compared to near Earth. We identify electromagnetic precursors
preceding a small subset of bow shock crossings with properties which are
consistent with whistler-mode waves. We find these monochromatic,
low-frequency, circularly-polarized waves to have a typical frequency range of
0.2 - 0.4 Hz in the spacecraft frame. This is due to the lower ion and electron
cyclotron frequencies near Saturn, between which whistler waves can develop.
The waves are also observed as predominantly right-handed in the spacecraft
frame, the opposite sense to what is typically observed near Earth. This is
attributed to the weaker Doppler shift, owing to the large angle between the
solar wind velocity and magnetic field vectors at 10 AU. Our results on the low

between the activity cycle length and the orbital period, as well as an
estimate for the modulation of the mass transfer rate. The latter is based on
Applegate's scenario, implying cyclic changes in the radius of the donor star
and thus in the mass transfer rate as a result of magnetic activity. Our model
is applied to a sample of 17 systems with known physical parameters, 10 also
with known orbital periods. In spite of the uncertainties of our simplified
framework, the results show a reasonable agreement, indicating that a dynamo
interpretation is potentially feasible. At the same time, we note that the
orbital period variations resulting from Applegate's model are sufficiently
small to be consistent with the data. We conclude that both larger samples with
known physical parameters as well as potential direct probes of the magnetism
of the donor star, including cold spots as well as polarization, will be
valuable to further constrain the nature of these systems.

have deep roots in the nature of the antinodal quasiparticles, the elementary
excitations with wavevector parallel to the Cu-O bonds. These electronic states
are most affected by the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations and charge
instabilities and they host the maximum of the anisotropic superconducting gap
and pseudogap. In this work, we use time-resolved extreme-ultra-violet (EUV)
photoemission with proper photon energy (18 eV) and time-resolution (50 fs) to
disclose the ultrafast dynamics of the antinodal states in a prototypical HTSC
cuprate. After photoinducing a non-thermal charge redistribution within the Cu
and O orbitals, we reveal a dramatic momentum-space differentiation of the
transient electron dynamics. While the nodal quasi-particle distribution is
heated up as in a conventional metal, new quasiparticle states transiently
emerge at the antinodes, similarly to what is expected for a photoexcited Mott
insulator, where the frozen charges can be released by an impulsive excitation.
This transient antinodal metallicity is mapped into the dynamics of the O-2$p$
bands thus directly demonstrating the intertwining between the low- and
high-energy scales that is typical of correlated materials. Our results suggest
that the correlation-driven freezing of the electrons moving along the Cu-O
bonds, analogous to the Mott localization mechanism, constitutes the starting
point for any model of high-$T_c$ superconductivity and other exotic phases of
HTSC cuprates.

and the high frequency tail of the source functions. As the upper bound of

can be overcome by using multi-frequency data. The method is based on integral

paradox is explained in part by the use of retweets to quote the original
content creator out of the message's original temporal context, for humor and
criticism purposes. As a consequence, messages diffused on online media can
have their polarity reversed over time, what poses challenges for social and
computer scientists aiming to classify and track opinion groups on online

antagonism in social platforms, and that surges of out-of-context retweets
correlate with sentiment drifts triggered by real-world events. We also discuss

of step-length and waiting time as well as mean square displacements and
entropies, we analyze three different click-through logs that contain the

Notable differences between the different logs reveal an increased efficiency

that online searches overwhelmingly yield local searches (i.e. on one page of

processes are a combination of local searches and relocation phases that are
power law distributed. Our investigation of click logs of search engines
therefore highlights the presence of intermittent search processes (where
phases of local explorations are separated by power law distributed relocation
jumps) in online searches. It follows that good search engines enable the users
to find the information they are looking for through a local exploration of a
single page with search results, whereas for poor search engines users are
often forced to do a broader exploration of different pages.

determined at a point in time earlier in the quantum annealing process. We also
find that the effective temperatures at different programming cycles fluctuate
greatly, with the effect worsening with problem size. We discuss the

facilitate the mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei.
We measure the torques exerted on accreting SMBH binaries, using 2D,
isothermal, moving-mesh, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary
accretion discs. Our computational domain includes the entire inner region of
the circumbinary disk with the individual black holes (BHs) included as point
masses on the grid and a sink prescription to model accretion onto each BH. The
BHs each acquire their own well-resolved accretion discs (""minidiscs""). We
explore a range of mass removal rates for the sink prescription removing gas
from the central regions of the minidiscs. We find that the torque exerted on
the binary is primarily gravitational, and dominated by the gas orbiting close
behind and ahead of the individual BHs. The torques from the distorted
circumbinary disc farther out and from the direct accretion of angular momentum
are subdominant. The torques are sensitive to the sink prescription: slower
sinks result in more gas accumulating near the BHs and more negative torques,
driving the binary to merger more rapidly. For faster sinks, the torques are
less negative and eventually turn positive (for unphysically fast sinks). When
the minidiscs are modeled as standard alpha discs, our results are insensitive
to the choice of sink radius. Scaling the simulations to a binary orbital
period tbin = 1yr and background disc accretion rate Mdot = 0.3MEdd in
Eddington units, the binary inspirals on a timescale of 3X10^6 years,
irrespective of the SMBH masses. For binaries with total mass <10^7Msun, this
is shorter than the inspiral time due to gravitational wave (GW) emission
alone, implying that gas discs will have a significant impact on the SMBH

the successive variational method for nuclear many-body problem. We apply TOAMD
to finite nuclei to be described by the central interaction with strong
short-range repulsion, and compare the results with the unitary correlation
operator method (UCOM). In TOAMD, the pair-type correlation functions and their
multiple products are operated to the AMD wave function. We show the results of
TOAMD using the Malfliet-Tjon central potential containing the strong
short-range repulsion. Adding the double products of the correlation functions
in TOAMD, the binding energies are converged quickly to the exact values of the
few-body calculations for s-shell nuclei. This indicates the high efficiency of
TOAMD for treating the short-range repulsion in nuclei. We also employ the
s-wave configurations of nuclei with the central part of UCOM, which reduces
the short-range relative amplitudes of nucleon pair in nuclei to avoid the
short-range repulsion. In UCOM, we further perform the superposition of the
s-wave configurations with various size parameters, which provides a
satisfactory solution of energies close to the exact and TOAMD values.

R(x) = (3x+1)/2^m (where 2^m is the larger power of 2 that divides 3x+1). The
conjecture is: Starting from any odd positive integer and repeating R(x) we
eventually get to 1.
  In a previous paper of the author the set of odd positive integers x such
that R^k(x) = 1 has been characterized as the set of odd integers whose binary
representation belongs to a set of strings G_k. Each string in G_k is the
concatenation of k strings z_k z_{k-1} ... z_1 where each z_i is a finite and
contiguous extract from some power of a string s_i of length 2x3^{i-1} (the
seed of order i). Clearly Collatz conjecture will be true if the binary
representation of any odd integer belongs to some G_k. Lately Patrick Chisan
Hew showed that seeds s_i are the repetends of 1/3^i.
  Here two contributions to Collatz conjecture are given:
  - Collatz conjecture is expressed in terms of a function \rho(y) that
operates on the set of all rational numbers 1/2 <= y < 1 having finite binary
representation. The main advantage of \rho(y) with respect to R(x) is that the
denominator can be only 2 or 4 (unlike R(x) whose denominator can be any power
of 2).
  - We show that the binary representation of each odd positive integer x is a
prefix of a power of infinitely many seeds s_i and we give an upper bound for
the minimum i in terms of the length n of the binary representation of x.

recent decades for its potential applications in robotics. However, there still
remains challenges when we aim at detecting multiple objects while retaining
low false positive rate in cluttered environments. This paper proposes a robust
3D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on RGB-D images, which
can detect multiple objects simultaneously while reducing false positives.
Detection begins with template matching and yields a set of template matches. A
clustering algorithm then groups templates of similar spatial location and
produces multiple-object hypotheses. A scoring function evaluates the
hypotheses using their associated templates and non-maximum suppression is
adopted to remove duplicate results based on the scores. Finally, a combination
of point cloud processing algorithms are used to compute objects' 3D poses.
Existing object hypotheses are verified by computing the overlap between model
and scene points. Experiments demonstrate that our approach provides
competitive results comparable to the state-of-the-arts and can be applied to
robot random bin-picking.

reconfigurability and versatility. A new modular robot can be built for a
specific task by using modules as building blocks. However, constructing a
kinematic model for a newly conceived robot requires significant work. Due to
the finite size of module-types, models of all module-types can be built
individually and stored in a database beforehand. With this priori knowledge,
the model construction process can be automated by detecting the modules and
their corresponding interconnections. Previous literature proposed theoretical
frameworks for constructing kinematic models of modular robots, assuming that
such information was known a priori. While well-devised mechanisms and built-in
sensors can be employed to detect these parameters automatically, they
significantly complicate the module design and thus are expensive. In this
paper, we propose a vision-based method to identify kinematic chains and
automatically construct robot models for modular robots. Each module is affixed
with augmented reality (AR) tags that are encoded with unique IDs. An image of
a modular robot is taken and the detected modules are recognized by querying a
database that maintains all module information. The poses of detected modules
are used to compute: (i) the connection between modules and (ii) joint angles
of joint-modules. Finally, the robot serial-link chain is identified and the
kinematic model constructed and visualized. Our experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our approach. While implementation with only our RMR is
shown, our method can be applied to other RMRs where self-identification is not
possible.

the nature of the resulting functional equation of $ I_{3,1} $.
  Finally, we apply the method to $ I_{1,1,1,1,1} $ at weight 5 to first
produce a reduction to depth $ \leq 3 $ integrals. Using some functional
equations from our thesis, we further reduce this to $ I_{3,1,1} $, $ I_{3,2} $

expected to be spinning with spin angular momenta misaligned with the orbital
angular momentum, causing the orbital plane to precess. This precession adds
rich structure to the gravitational waves, introducing such complexity that an
analytic closed-form description has been unavailable until now. We here
construct the first closed-form frequency- domain gravitational waveforms that
are valid for generic spin-precessing quasicircular compact binary inspirals.
We first construct time-domain gravitational waves by solving the
post-Newtonian precession equations of motion with radiation reaction through
multiple scale analysis. We then Fourier transform these time-domain waveforms
with the method of shifted uniform asymptotics to obtain closed-form
expressions for frequency-domain waveforms. We study the accuracy of these
analytic, frequency-domain waveforms relative to waveforms obtained by
numerically evolving the post-Newtonian equations of motion and find that they
are suitable for unbiased parameter estimation for 99.2%(94.6%) of the binary
configurations we studied at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10(25). These new
frequency-domain waveforms could be used for detection and parameter estimation

of their mass-luminosity and mass-radius relations, both crucial in
characterizing exoplanet-host stars and, in turn, their planetary systems. The

investigate the general model of ""quantum-Zeno-like"" IFM, whose optics setup is
a Mach-Zehnder like interferometer utilizing the quantum Zeno effect, where the
object to be detected is semitransparent and the interrogation cycle number $N$
is finite. And we define two important probabilities $P_{\rm loss}$ and $P_{\rm
error}$ to evaluate the IFM process, which describe the photon loss rate and
the error of discriminating the presenece/absence of the object respectively.
The minimum values of these two probabilities and the corresponding initial
input states to reach them are attained via this model. And we find that when
the interrogation cycle $N$ approaches infinity, the object can be perfectly
detected, where the minimum values of these two probabilities are both zero and
the initial input state to reach them becomes the same state $|1\rangle$ in our
system. In addition, we also study whether quantum correlation can benefit IFM
or not, but the answer is no, in the sense that the entangled photon input
state cannot minimize $P_{\rm loss}$, $P_{\rm error}$ more than single photon
input state. Our work provides principal theoretic support for the practical
realization of IFM and the employed analysis technique can be applied to other
quantum facilitating scenarios.

electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions in the two-orbital Hubbard-Holstein model
at half filling using the dynamical mean field theory. We find that the e-ph
interaction, even at weak couplings, strongly modifies the phase diagram of
this model and introduces an orbital-selective Peierls insulating phase (OSPI)
that is analogous to the widely studied orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP). At
small e-e and e-ph coupling, we find a competition between the OSMP and the
OSPI, while at large couplings, a competition occurs between Mott and
charge-density-wave (CDW) insulating phases. We further demonstrate that the
Hund's coupling influences the OSPI transition by lowering the energy
associated with the CDW. Our results explicitly show that one must be cautious
when neglecting the e-ph interaction in multiorbital systems, where multiple
electronic interactions create states that are readily influenced by perturbing
interactions.

emission abruptly at some radius, its high-latitude emission would obey the
relation of $\hat{\alpha}$ (the temporal index) = $2 + \hat{\beta}$ (the
spectral index). However, this relation is violated by the X-ray fares in some
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), whose $\hat{\alpha}$ is much more steeper. We show
that the synchrotron radiation should be anisotropic when the angular
distribution of accelerated electrons has preferable orientation, and this
anisotropy would naturally lead to the steeper decay for the high-latitude
emission if the the intrinsic emission is limb-brightened. We use our simple
toy model to reproduce the temporal and the spectral evolution of the X-ray
flares. We show that our model can well interpret the steep decay of the X-ray
flares in the three GRBs selected as example. Recent simulations on particle
acceleration may support the specific anisotropic distribution of the electrons
adopted in our work. Reversely, confirmation of the anisotropy in the radiation
would give meaningful clues to the details of electron acceleration in the
emitting region.

  Low-Dimensional Controller Retrofit Approach",,,,,"cs.SY math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a method of designing low-dimensional retrofit
controllers for interconnected linear systems. In the proposed method, by
retrofitting an additional low-dimensional controller to a preexisting control
system, we aim at improving transient responses caused by spatially local state
deflections, which can be regarded as a local fault occurring at a specific
subsystem. It is found that a type of state-space expansion, called
hierarchical state-space expansion, is the key to systematically designing a
low-dimensional retrofit controller, whose action is specialized to controlling
the corresponding subsystem. Furthermore, the state-space expansion enables
theoretical clarification of the fact that the performance index of the
transient response control is improved by appropriately tuning the retrofit
controller. The efficiency of the proposed method is shown through a motivating
example of power system control where we clarify the trade-off relation between
the dimension of a retrofit controller and its control performance.

real four-dimensional space-time via a field of orthonormal tetrads with an
enlarged covariance group. This new group, called the conservation group,
contains the group of diffeomorphisms as a proper subgroup and we hypothesize
that it is the foundational group for quantum geometry. Using the curvature
vector, $C_\mu$, we find a free-field Lagrangian density $C^\mu C_\mu
\sqrt{-g}\,$. When massive objects are present a source term is added to this
Lagrangian density. Spherically symmetric solutions for both the free field and
the field with sources have been derived. The field equations require nonzero
stress-energy tensors in regions where no source is present and thus may bring
in dark matter and dark energy in a natural way. A simple model for a galaxy is
given which satisfies our field equations. This model includes flat rotation
curves. In this paper we compare our results with recently reported results of
McGaugh, Lelli and Schombert which exhibit a new law between the observed
radial acceleration and the baryonic radial acceleration. We find a slightly
different model which relates these accelerations. In conjunction with our
model, the McGaugh, Lelli and Schombert relation imply a new critical baryonic
acceleration. When applied to bulge-dominated galaxies, this critical baryonic
acceleration may be used to predict the radial velocity curve value by using
the radius of the bulge.

cosmology \cite{Ntampaka16Dynamical,Ravanbakhsh16ICML1}. Our main theorem
characterizes the permutation invariant functions and provides a family of
functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong.
This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a
deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on
a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning
tasks. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for permutation
equivariance in deep models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on
population statistic estimation, point cloud classification, set expansion, and
outlier detection.

  Microarchitectures",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time variation during program execution can leak sensitive information. Time
variations due to program control flow and hardware resource contention have
been used to steal encryption keys in cipher implementations such as AES and
RSA. A number of approaches to mitigate timing-based side-channel attacks have
been proposed including cache partitioning, control-flow obfuscation and
injecting timing noise into the outputs of code. While these techniques make
timing-based side-channel attacks more difficult, they do not eliminate the
risks. Prior techniques are either too specific or too expensive, and all leave
remnants of the original timing side channel for later attackers to attempt to
exploit.
  In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art techniques in timing
side-channel protection, which limit timing leakage but do not eliminate it,
still have significant vulnerabilities to timing-based side-channel attacks. To
provide a means for total protection from timing-based side-channel attacks, we
develop Ozone, the first zero timing leakage execution resource for a modern
microarchitecture. Code in Ozone execute under a special hardware thread that
gains exclusive access to a single core's resources for a fixed (and limited)
number of cycles during which it cannot be interrupted. Memory access under
Ozone thread execution is limited to a fixed size uncached scratchpad memory,
and all Ozone threads begin execution with a known fixed microarchitectural
state. We evaluate Ozone using a number of security sensitive kernels that have
previously been targets of timing side-channel attacks, and show that Ozone
eliminates timing leakage with minimal performance overhead.
