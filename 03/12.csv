multiple signals into one signal and transmit over a shared medium.
Multiplexing can increase the channel capacity by requiring more resources on
the transmission medium. For instance, the space-division multiplexing
accomplished through the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme achieves
significant capacity increase by the realized parallel channel, but it requires
expensive hardware resources. Here, we present a novel multiplexing
methodology, named meta-multiplexing, which allows ordinary modulated signals
overlap together to form a set of ""artificial"" parallel channels, meanwhile, it
only requires similar resources as ordinary modulation schemes. We prove the
capacity law for the meta-multiplexing system and disclose that under broad
conditions, the capacity of a single channel increases linearly with the signal
to noise ratio (SNR), which breaks the conventional logarithmic growth of the
capacity over SNR. Numerous simulation studies verify the capacity law and
demonstrate the high efficiency of meta-multiplexing. Through proof-of-concept
hardware experiments, we tested the proposed method in communication practices
and achieved a spectral efficiency of 81.7 bits/s/Hz over a single channel,
which is significantly higher than the efficiency of any existing communication
system.

downstream flow (determined by the wedge angle that is less or larger than the

different categories. Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows
when we can reliably separate hate speech from other offensive language and
when this differentiation is more difficult. We find that racist and homophobic
tweets are more likely to be classified as hate speech but that sexist tweets
are generally classified as offensive. Tweets without explicit hate keywords
are also more difficult to classify.

additional spatial inhomogeneity introduced by the demagnetizing field. This
modifies spin wave dispersion, makes the band structure of magnonic crystals
strongly dependent on shape of the inclusions and type of the lattice. The
inhomogeneity of the internal magnetic field becomes unimportant for magnonic

(FE) area on electron emission characteristics of uniform semimetallic
nitrogen-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond ((N)UNCD) field emitters. To
obtain the actual FE area, imaging experiments were carried out in a vacuum
system in a parallel-plate configuration with a specialty anode phosphor
screen. Electron emission micrographs were taken concurrently with $I$-$V$
characteristics measurements. It was found that in uniform (N)UNCD films the
field emitting site distribution is not uniform across the surface, and that
the actual FE area depends on the applied electric field.
  To quantify the actual FE area dependence on the applied electric field, a
novel automated image processing algorithm was developed. The algorithm
processes extensive imaging datasets and calculates emission area per image. By
doing so, it was determined that the emitting area was always significantly
smaller than the FE cathode surface area of 0.152 cm$^2$ available. Namely, the
actual FE area would change from $5\times10^{-3}$ \% to 1.5 \% of the total
cathode area with the applied electric field increased.
  Finally and most importantly, it was shown that when $I$-$E$ curves as
measured in the experiment were normalized by the field-dependent emission
area, the resulting $j$-$E$ curves demonstrated a strong kink and significant
deviation from Fowler-Nordheim (FN) law, and eventually saturated at a current
density of $\sim$100 mA/cm$^2$. This value was nearly identical for all studied
(N)UNCD films, regardless of the substrate.

solutions for the ghost and gluon propagators, which correspond to nontrivial
infrared fixed points. The decoupling fixed point is infrared stable and weakly
coupled, while the scaling fixed point is unstable and generically strongly

$2\alpha_F=2-d$ and $2\alpha_G=d$ at all orders of perturbation theory in the

investigate brain organization through networks of brain regions that

from observed fMRI using data-driven analytic methods such as independent
component analysis (ICA). A notable limitation of these FC methods is that they
do not provide any information on the underlying structural connectivity (SC),
which is believed to serve as the basis for interregional interactions in brain
activity. We propose a new statistical measure of the strength of SC (sSC)
underlying FC networks obtained from data-driven methods. The sSC measure is
developed using information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and can
be applied to compare the strength of SC across different FC networks.
Furthermore, we propose a reliability index for data-driven FC networks to
measure the reproducibility of the networks through re-sampling the observed
data. To perform statistical inference such as hypothesis testing on the sSC,
we develop a formal variance estimator of sSC based a spatial semivariogram
model with a novel distance metric. We demonstrate the performance of the sSC
measure and its estimation and inference methods with simulation studies. For
real data analysis, we apply our methods to a multimodal imaging study with
resting-state fMRI and DTI data from 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with
major depressive disorder. Results show that well-known resting state networks
all demonstrate higher SC within the network as compared to the average
structural connections across the brain. We also found that sSC is positively
associated with the reliability index, indicating that the FC networks that
have stronger underlying SC are more reproducible across samples.

such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like
crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well
studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with
stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems
target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on
top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple
platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned.
However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different
systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can
be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing
platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly
improve their platforms.
  In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework
for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for
different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design
choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs
and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart
contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms
of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use
BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private
blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate
that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in
traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in
performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices
at different layers of the software stack.

millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, where the number of radio frequency (RF)
chains is much less than the number of antennas equipped at each transceiver.
The proposed mmWave channel estimation algorithm first exploits multiple
frequency tones to estimate the strongest angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) at both base
station (BS) and user sides for the design of analog beamforming matrices. Then
all the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the BS along the directions
of the estimated strongest AoAs in order to estimate the channel. The estimated
channel will be adopted to design the digital zero-forcing (ZF) precoder at the
BS for the multi-user downlink transmission. The proposed channel estimation
algorithm is applicable to both nonsparse and sparse mmWave channel
environments. Furthermore, we derive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the
digital ZF precoding with the proposed channel estimation algorithm scheme. Our
analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme obtains a
considerable achievable rate of fully digital systems, where the number of RF
chains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas.
Besides, by taking into account the effect of various types of errors, i.e.,
random phase errors, transceiver analog beamforming errors, and equivalent
channel estimation errors, we derive a closed-form approximation for the
achievable rate of the considered scheme. We illustrate the robustness of the
proposed channel estimation and multi-user downlink precoding scheme against
the system imperfection.

  (CVPR'17)",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, DNN model compression based on network architecture design, e.g.,
SqueezeNet, attracted a lot attention. No accuracy drop on image classification
is observed on these extremely compact networks, compared to well-known models.
An emerging question, however, is whether these model compression techniques
hurt DNN's learning ability other than classifying images on a single dataset.
Our preliminary experiment shows that these compression methods could degrade
domain adaptation (DA) ability, though the classification performance is
preserved. Therefore, we propose a new compact network architecture and
unsupervised DA method in this paper. The DNN is built on a new basic module
Conv-M which provides more diverse feature extractors without significantly
increasing parameters. The unified framework of our DA method will
simultaneously learn invariance across domains, reduce divergence of feature
representations, and adapt label prediction. Our DNN has 4.1M parameters, which
is only 6.7% of AlexNet or 59% of GoogLeNet. Experiments show that our DNN
obtains GoogLeNet-level accuracy both on classification and DA, and our DA
method slightly outperforms previous competitive ones. Put all together, our DA
strategy based on our DNN achieves state-of-the-art on sixteen of total
eighteen DA tasks on popular Office-31 and Office-Caltech datasets.

solution to enhancing the system performance. Motivated by this, we revisit a
full-duplex base station (FD-BS) aided OFDMA system, which consists of one BS,
several uplink/downlink users and multiple subcarriers. A joint 3-dimensional
(3D) mapping scheme among subcarriers, down-link users (DUEs), uplink users
(UUEs) is considered as well as an associated power allocation optimization. In
detail, we first decompose the complex 3D mapping problem into three
2-dimensional sub ones and solve them by using the iterative Hungarian method,
respectively. Then based on the Lagrange dual method, we sequentially solve the
power allocation and 3- dimensional mapping problem by fixing a dual point.
Finally, the optimal solution can be obtained by utilizing the sub-gradient
method. Unlike existing work that only solves either 3D mapping or power
allocation problem but with a high computation complexity, we tackle both of
them and have successfully reduced computation complexity from exponential to
polynomial order. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed
scheme.

effective Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) equations. We next investigate the
behavior of $S$-matrix poles near the threshold when two-body and three-body
thresholds are degenerate. We solve the eigenvalue equations of the kernel of
AGS equations instead of AGS equations themselves to obtain the $S$-matrix pole
energy. We then face a problem of unphysical singularity: though the physical
transition amplitudes have physical singularities only, the kernel of AGS
equations have unphysical singularities. We show, however, that these
unphysical singularities can be removed by appropriate reorganization of the
scattering equations and mass renormalization. The behavior of $S$-matrix poles
near the degenerate threshold is found to be universal in the sense that the
complex pole energy, $E$, is determined by a real parameter, $c$, as $c - E
\log{\left( - E \right)} = 0$, or equivalently, ${\rm Im} E = - \pi {\rm Re} E
/ \log{\mid {\rm Re} E \mid}$. This behavior is different from that of either

square lattice with near resonance frequencies, i.e., tuned close to the energy
separation between $s$-band and the $p$-bands. First, we derive a
time-independent four-band effective Hamiltonian in the non-interacting limit.
Diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian yields a quasi-energy spectrum
consistent with the full numerical Floquet solution that includes all higher
bands. In particular, we find that the hybridized $s$-band develops multiple
minima and therefore non-trivial Fermi surfaces at different fillings. We then
obtain the effective interactions for atoms in the hybridized $s$-band
analytically and show that they acquire momentum dependence on the Fermi
surface even though the bare interaction is contact-like. We apply the theory
to find the phase diagram of fermions with weak attractive interactions and
demonstrate that the pairing symmetry is $s+d$-wave. Our theory is valid for a
range of shaking frequencies near resonance, and it can be generalized to other
phases of interacting fermions in shaken lattices.

ungrammatical sentence ""The key to the cabinet are on the table"". One
explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account:
the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to
the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis
& Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is
misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion
process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural

facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number,
it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to
keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first
sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We
show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite
mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical
Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We
show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding
to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature
percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.

projection algorithm to uncover country and product communities. Contrary to
past endeavors, our methodology, based on information theory, creates
monopartite projections in an unbiased and analytically tractable way. Single
links between countries or products represent statistically significant
signals, which are not accounted for by null-models such as the Bipartite
Configuration Model. We find stable country communities reflecting the
socioeconomic distinction in developed, newly industrialized, and developing
countries. Furthermore, we observe product clusters based on the aforementioned
country groups. Our analysis reveals the existence of a complicate structure in
the bipartite International Trade Network: apart from the diversification of
export baskets from the most basic to the most exclusive products, we observe a
statistically significant signal of an export specialization mechanism towards
more sophisticated products.

shape originates from quantum interference between direct and indirect
transition pathways in continuum-bound coupled systems, and is a ubiquitous
phenomenon in atomic, molecular, nuclear and solid-state physics. In optical
nanoscale structures, the Fano effect has wide-ranging applications that
include optical filtering, sensing, all-optical switching, quantum
interferometry and nonlinear optics, and this opens new avenues for photonic
devices. The emergent area of ultracold atomic and molecular gases presents an
ideal platform for studying Fano resonances, since the physical parameters of
these gases can be extensively tuned with high precision using external fields.
However, an experimental demonstration of the Fano effect in hybridized
atom-molecular coupled systems has remained elusive. Here, we report on
observations of the Fano effect in molecular spectra obtained by
photoassociation near a d-wave Feshbach resonance. This effect occurs due to
quantum interference in PA transitions involving the continuum of atom-atom
scattering states, the underlying Feshbach and photoassociated excited bound
molecular states. We measure the variation in atom loss rate with an external
magnetic field close to the Feshbach resonance in the presence of PA laser, and
thereby clearly demonstrate the Fano effect. Our results further reveal that
the Fano effect has significant influence on spectral shifts. Based on Fano's
method, we develop a theory that explains the observed experimental results
relatively well. Our theoretical formulation takes into account quantum
interference between or among multiple transition pathways and between
inelastic channels. Our results present a novel method for tuning the
collisional interaction strength with laser light using Fano resonance.

an understanding of how the models will behave in the future, and how to

about what a DNN actually does due to its opaque or black-box nature. To
address this issue, we propose a novel technique to improve the

extract a set of semantically meaningful topics from the human descriptions
that cover a wide range of visual concepts, and integrate them into the model

algorithm to interpret the learned features of each neuron. Experimental
results demonstrate its effectiveness in video captioning using the
interpretable features, which can also be transferred to video action
recognition. By clearly understanding the learned features, users can easily
revise false predictions via a human-in-the-loop procedure.

in today's device engineering, such as capacitors and memories. Their physical
properties are further enriched by suppressing the long-range polar order, as
is exemplified by quantum paraelectrics with giant piezoelectric and dielectric
responses at low temperatures. Likewise in metals, a polar lattice distortion
has been theoretically predicted to give rise to various unusual physical
properties. So far, however, a ""ferroelectric""-like transition in metals has
seldom been controlled and hence its possible impacts on transport phenomena
remain unexplored. Here we report the discovery of anomalous enhancement of
thermopower near the critical region between the polar and nonpolar metallic
phases in 1T'-Mo$_{1-x}$Nb$_{x}$Te$_2$ with a chemically tunable polar
transition. It is unveiled from the first-principles calculations and
magnetotransport measurements that charge transport with strongly
energy-dependent scattering rate critically evolves towards the boundary to the
nonpolar phase, resulting in large cryogenic thermopower. Such a significant
influence of the structural instability on transport phenomena might arise from
the fluctuating or heterogeneous polar metallic states, which would pave a
novel route to improving thermoelectric efficiency.

convergent in the Cesaro sense. In particular, we deduce that the limiting
distribution is uniform if the transition matrix is symmetric. In the cases of
non-symmetric Markov chain, we exemplify that the limiting distribution of the
quantum walk is not necessarily identical with the stationary distribution of
the underlying irreducible Markov chain. The Szegedy scheme can be extended to
infinite state Markov chains (random walks). In the second part, we formulate
the quantum walk induced from a lazy random walk on the line. We then obtain

the two users are equal, two operating conditions are considered with
uncoded-QPSK relaying. In the first condition, both users are completely
synchronized in phase and transmit power, and in the second condition, phase is
not synchronized. The peak power constraint imposed by the satellite amplifier
is considered and the error performance bounds are derived for both the
conditions. The simulation results for end-to-end Bit Error Rate (BER) and

designing accurate nonlinear activation functions, which have a significant

existing SC computing blocks. In this paper, we design and optimize SC based
neurons, and we propose highly accurate activation designs for the three most
frequently used activation functions in software DCNNs, i.e, hyperbolic

using MNIST dataset demonstrate that compared with a binary ASIC hardware DCNN,
the DCNN with the proposed SC neurons can achieve up to 61X, 151X, and 2X
improvement in terms of area, power, and energy, respectively, at the cost of
small precision degradation.In addition, the SC approach achieves up to 21X and
41X of the area, 41X and 72X of the power, and 198200X and 96443X of the

estimation. Current adaptation techniques often use linear size or linear
similarity adjustment mechanisms which are often not suitable for datasets that
have complex structure with many categorical attributes. Furthermore, the use
of nonlinear adaptation technique such as neural network and genetic algorithms
needs many user interactions and parameters optimization for configuring them
(such as network model, number of neurons, activation functions, training
functions, mutation, selection, crossover, ... etc.). Aims: In response to the
abovementioned challenges, the present paper proposes a new adaptation strategy
using Model Tree based attribute distance to adjust estimation by analogy and
derive new estimates. Using Model Tree has an advantage to deal with
categorical attributes, minimize user interaction and improve efficiency of
model learning through classification. Method: Seven well known datasets have
been used with 3-Fold cross validation to empirically validate the proposed
approach. The proposed method has been investigated using various K analogies
from 1 to 3. Results: Experimental results showed that the proposed approach
produced better results when compared with those obtained by using estimation
by analogy based linear size adaptation, linear similarity adaptation,
'regression towards the mean' and null adaptation. Conclusions: Model Tree
could form a useful extension for estimation by analogy especially for complex
data sets with large number of categorical attributes.
