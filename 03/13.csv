understanding the final fate of gravitational collapse of massive bodies once
some prescriptions for the behaviour of gravity in the strong field regime are
provided. The general picture arising from most of these scenarios is that the
classical singularity at the end of collapse is replaced by a bounce. The most
striking consequence of the bounce is that the black hole horizon may live for
only a finite time. The possible implications for astrophysics are important
since, if these models capture the essence of the collapse of a massive star,
an observable signature of quantum gravity may be hiding in astrophysical
phenomena. One intriguing idea that is implied by these models is the possible
existence of exotic compact objects, of high density and finite size, that may
not be covered by an horizon. The present article outlines the main features of
these collapse models and some of the most relevant open problems. The aim is
to provide a comprehensive (as much as possible) overview of the current status
of the field from the point of view of astrophysics. As a little extra, a new
toy model for collapse leading to the formation of a quasi static compact
object is presented.

The key technical barrier preventing exact incentive compatibility in prior

typically #P-hard to compute. Reductions that instead estimate the output
distribution by sampling inevitably suffer from sampling error, which typically

  We overcome this barrier by employing and generalizing the computational

that of an ""output coin"", and the challenge is to efficiently simulate the

switchable structural phase. Strain engineering is widely accepted as a clean
and flexible method, however, cannot be achieved in engineering monolayer MoS2
phase transition because the critical biaxial strain required (~15%) is much
larger than measured elastic limit (~11%). In this study, employing density
functional theoretical calculations, it has been found out that with the
forming of heterostructure between MoS2 with buckled 2D materials such as
silicence, germanene and stanene, only a small strain can trigger the phase
transition. As being suggested by the constructed phase stability diagram,
biaxial deformation as low as 3% in MoS2/silicene and MoS2/stanene sandwich
structure, would be sufficient to induce the structural phase transition in
MoS2 lattice. This strain falls well within experimental elastic limit, thus
would be feasible to realize in experiment. The origin of such behavior can be
understood as strain induced interlayer covalent bond formation, which finally
make MoS2 lattice more sensitive to external strain. This theoretical work
provides one realistic route for achieving flexible phase stabilities in

  We propose an inexpensive and feasible strategy for network elicitation using
Aggregated Relational Data (ARD) -- responses to questions of the form ""How
many of your social connections have trait k?"" Our method uses ARD to recover
the parameters of a general network formation model, which in turn, permits the
estimation of any arbitrary node- or graph-level statistic. The method works
well in simulations and in matching a range of network characteristics in
real-world graphs from 75 Indian villages. Moreover, we replicate the results
of two field experiments that involved collecting network data. We show that
the researchers would have drawn similar conclusions using ARD alone. Finally,
using calculations from J-PAL fieldwork, we show that in rural India, for
example, ARD surveys are 80% cheaper than full network surveys.

finding the ground state in a glassy energy landscape with an exponential

Green's function to acoustic impedance. The approximation is simple, fast to
compute and has become a standard part of seismic theory. The present paper
re-examines this classical approximation in light of new results concerning the

that the classical approximation can be substantially improved. We derive an
alternate formula, called the refined impedance transform, that retains the
simplicity and speed of computation of the classical estimate, but which is
qualitatively more accurate and applicable to a wider range of recorded data.
The refined impedance transform can be applied to recorded data directly

of an arbitrary slab of unknown structure. The results are illustrated with

design and implement a two-phase approach for leak event identification, which
leverages dynamic data from multiple information sources including IoT sensing

human inputs (tweets posted on Twitter). In the approach, a high order
Conditional Random Field (CRF) is constructed that enforces predictions based
on IoT observations consistent with human inputs to improve the performance of

  Considering the physical water network as a graph, a CRF model is built and
learned by the Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM) using node features
such as water pressure and flow rate. After that, we built the high order CRF
system by enforcing twitter leakage detection information. An optimal inference
algorithm is proposed for the adapted high order CRF model. Experimental

have been successfully used over the years and have provided a significant
increase on a wireless link's capacity by enabling the transmission of multiple
data streams. Assuming channel knowledge at the transmitter, the maximization
of the mutual information of a MIMO link is achieved by finding the optimal
power allocation under a given sum-power constraint, which is in turn obtained
by the water-filling (WF) algorithm. However, in spectrum sharing setups, such
as Licensed Shared Access (LSA), where a primary link (PL) and a secondary link
(SL) coexist, the power transmitted by the SL transmitter may induce harmful
interference to the PL receiver. While such co-existing links have been
considered extensively in various spectrum sharing setups, the mutual
information of the SL under a constraint on the interference it may cause to
the PL receiver has, quite astonishingly, not been evaluated so far. In this
paper, we solve this problem, find its unique optimal solution and provide the
power allocation policy and corresponding precoding solution that achieves the
optimal capacity under the imposed constraint. The performance of the optimal
solution and the penalty due to the interference constraint are evaluated over
some indicative Rayleigh fading channel conditions and interference thresholds.
We believe that the obtained results are of general nature and that they may
apply, beyond spectrum sharing, to a variety of applications that admit a

in biology. They are considered in textbooks as simple filaments with larger
stiffness. Recent observations of flagellar counterbend, however, show that
induction of curvature in one section of a passive flagellum instigates a
compensatory counter-curvature elsewhere, exposing the intricate role of the
diminutive cross-linking proteins at large-scales. We show that this effect, a
material property of the cross-linking mechanics, modifies the bundle dynamics
non-trivially, and induces a bimodal $L^2-L^3$ length-dependent material
response that departs from the Euler-Bernoulli theory. Hence, the use of
simpler theories to analyse experiments can result in paradoxical
interpretations. Remarkably, the counterbend dynamics instigates counter-waves
in opposition to driven oscillations in distant parts of the bundle, with
potential impact on the regulation of flagellar bending waves. These results
have a range of physical and biological applications, including the empirical
disentanglement of material quantities via counterbend dynamics.

  Log-Squared Nondecimated Wavelet Coefficients",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-frequency measurements and images acquired from various sources in the
real world often possess a degree of self-similarity and inherent regular
scaling. When data look like a noise, the scaling exponent may be the only
informative feature that summarizes such data. Methods for the assessment of
self-similarity by estimating Hurst exponent often involve analysis of rate of
decay in a spectrum defined in various multiresolution domains. When this
spectrum is calculated using discrete non-decimated wavelet transforms, due to
increased autocorrelation in wavelet coefficients, the estimators of $H$ show
increased bias compared to the estimators that use traditional orthogonal
transforms. At the same time, non-decimated transforms have a number of
advantages when employed for calculation of wavelet spectra and estimation of
Hurst exponents: the variance of the estimator is smaller, input signals and
images could be of arbitrary size, and due to the shift-invariance, the local
scaling can be assessed as well. We propose two methods based on robust
estimation and resampling that alleviate the effect of increased
autocorrelation while maintaining all advantages of non-decimated wavelet
transforms. The proposed methods extend the approaches in existing literature
where the logarithmic transformation and pairing of wavelet coefficients are
used for lowering the bias. In a simulation study we use fractional Brownian
motions with a range of theoretical Hurst exponents. For such signals for which
""true"" $H$ is known, we demonstrate bias reduction and overall reduction of the
mean-squared error by the two proposed estimators. For fractional Brownian
motions, both proposed methods yield estimators of $H$ that are asymptotically
normal and unbiased.

  citation/bibliography style",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An elementary biostatistical theory based on a selectivity-variability
principle is proposed to address a question raised by Charles Darwin, namely,
how one sex of a sexually dimorphic species might tend to evolve with greater
variability than the other sex. Briefly, the theory says that if one sex is
relatively selective then from one generation to the next, more variable
subpopulations of the opposite sex will generally tend to prevail over those
with lesser variability. Moreover, the perhaps less intuitive converse also
holds: if a sex is relatively non-selective, then less variable subpopulations
of the opposite sex will prevail over those with greater variability. This
theory requires certain regularity conditions on the distributions, but makes
no assumptions about differences in means between the sexes, nor does it
presume that one sex is selective and the other non-selective. Two mathematical
models of the selectivity-variability principle are presented: a discrete-time
one-step probabilistic model of short-term behavior with an example using
normally distributed perceived fitness values; and a continuous-time
deterministic model for the long-term asymptotic behavior of the expected sizes
of the subpopulations with an example using exponentially distributed fitness
levels.

world and has a considerable mortality rate. Early diagnosis is particularly
important since melanoma can be cured with prompt excision. Dermoscopy images
play an important role in the non-invasive early detection of melanoma [1].
However, melanoma detection using human vision alone can be subjective,
inaccurate and poorly reproducible even among experienced dermatologists. This
is attributed to the challenges in interpreting images with diverse
characteristics including lesions of varying sizes and shapes, lesions that may
have fuzzy boundaries, different skin colors and the presence of hair [2].
Therefore, the automatic analysis of dermoscopy images is a valuable aid for
clinical decision making and for image-based diagnosis to identify diseases
such as melanoma [1-4]. Deep residual networks (ResNets) has achieved
state-of-the-art results in image classification and detection related problems
[5-8]. In this ISIC 2017 skin lesion analysis challenge [9], we propose to
exploit the deep ResNets for robust visual features learning and

wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating over small cell networks
(SCNs). In order to capture the VR users' quality-of-service (QoS) in SCNs, a
novel VR model, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is proposed. This
model jointly accounts for VR metrics such as tracking accuracy, processing
delay, and transmission delay. In this model, the small base stations (SBSs)
act as the VR control centers that collect the tracking information from VR
users over the cellular uplink. Once this information is collected, the SBSs
will then send the three dimensional images and accompanying surround stereo
audio to the VR users over the downlink. Therefore, the resource allocation
problem in VR wireless networks must jointly consider both the uplink and
downlink. This problem is then formulated as a noncooperative game and a
distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state
networks (ESNs) is proposed to find the solution of this game. The use of the
proposed ESN algorithm enables the SBSs to predict the VR QoS of each SBS and
guarantees the convergence to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. The analytical
result shows that each user's VR QoS jointly depends on both VR tracking
accuracy and wireless resource allocation. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm yields significant gains, in terms of total utility value of
VR QoS, that reach up to 22.2% and 37.5%, respectively, compared to Q-learning
and a baseline proportional fair algorithm. The results also show that the
proposed algorithm has a faster convergence time than Q-learning and can
guarantee low delays for VR services.

the parsing results lose rich context around entities in the patterns, and the

We propose an efficient framework, called MetaPAD, which discovers meta
patterns from massive corpora with three techniques: (1) it develops a
context-aware segmentation method to carefully determine the boundaries of
patterns with a learnt pattern quality assessment function, which avoids costly
dependency parsing and generates high-quality patterns; (2) it identifies and
groups synonymous meta patterns from multiple facets---their types, contexts,
and extractions; and (3) it examines type distributions of entities in the
instances extracted by each group of patterns, and looks for appropriate type
levels to make discovered patterns precise. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed framework discovers high-quality typed textual patterns efficiently

synchrotron and Compton emission from an intrabinary shock (IBS). We find that
a simple one-zone model is inadequate to explain the IBS emission, but that
beamed Synchrotron-self Compton radiation from adiabatically accelerated plasma
in the shocked pulsar wind can reproduce the complex multiband light curves,
including the variable X-ray spike coincident with the gamma-ray maximum. The
model requires inclination $\sim$50$^\circ$ and orbital eccentricity
$\sim$0.35, consistent with the limited constraints from existing optical
observations. This picture motivates searches for pulsations from the energetic
young pulsar powering the wind shock.

from user provided ratings. In particular, the proposed R2P model can achieve
the following: 1. Correctly integrate user ratings into model training. 2.Infer
multiple demographic attributes of users simultaneously, capturing the
underlying relevance between different demographic attributes. 3. Train its two
components, i.e. feature extractor and classifier, in an integrated manner
under a supervised learning paradigm, which effectively helps to discover
useful hidden patterns from highly sparse ratings data. We introduce how to
incorporate user ratings data into the research field of cognitive inference of
user demographic data, and detail the model development and optimization
process for the proposed R2P. Extensive experiments are conducted on two
real-world ratings datasets against various compared state-of-the-art methods,
and the results from multiple aspects demonstrate that our proposed R2P model
can significantly improve on the cognitive inference performance of user
demographic data.

electronic and optoelectronic applications. This work explores and exhibits,
for the first time for visible light, a clear evidence of the zero-biased
optoelectronic switching in randomly dispersed Ge and Si NW networks. The test
bench, on which the NWs were dispersed for optoelectronic characterization, was
fabricated using standard CMOS fabrication process, and utilized metal contacts
with dissimilar work functions - Al and Ni. The randomly dispersed NWs respond
to light by exhibiting substantial photocurrents and, most remarkably,
demonstrate zero-bias photo-switching. The magnitude of the photocurrent is
dependent on the NW material, as well as the channel length. The photocurrent
in randomly dispersed GeNWs was found to be higher by orders of magnitude
compared to SiNWs. In both of these material systems, when the length of the
NWs was comparable to the channel length, the currents in sparse NW networks
were found to be higher than that in dense NW networks, which can be explained
by considering various possible arrangements of NWs in these devices.

variables across a set of subjects whose observations do not align naturally.
For example, when modeling medical features across a set of patients, the
number and duration of treatments may vary widely in time, meaning there is no
meaningful way to align their clinical records across time points for analysis
purposes. To handle such data, the state-of-the-art tensor model is the
so-called PARAFAC2, which yields interpretable and robust output and can
naturally handle sparse data. However, its main limitation up to now has been
the lack of efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale datasets.
  In this work, we fill this gap by developing a scalable method to compute the
PARAFAC2 decomposition of large and sparse datasets, called SPARTan. Our method
exploits special structure within PARAFAC2, leading to a novel algorithmic
reformulation that is both fast (in absolute time) and more memory-efficient
than prior work. We evaluate SPARTan on both synthetic and real datasets,
showing 22X performance gains over the best previous implementation and also
handling larger problem instances for which the baseline fails. Furthermore, we
are able to apply SPARTan to the mining of temporally-evolving phenotypes on
data taken from real and medically complex pediatric patients. The clinical
meaningfulness of the phenotypes identified in this process, as well as their
temporal evolution over time for several patients, have been endorsed by
clinical experts.

cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should
minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an
acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and
power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system.
Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher

hierarchical framework for solving the overall resource allocation and power

framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and
a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated

problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are
adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the

power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free

dynamics of gapless quantum antiferromagnets described by the spin-rotation
invariant Heisenberg Hamiltonian ($H$). Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
we propagate an initial state with maximal order parameter $m^z_s$ (the
staggered magnetization) in the $z$ spin direction and monitor the expectation
value $\langle m^z_s\rangle $ as a function of the time $\tau$. Different
system sizes of lengths $L$ exhibit an initial size-independent relaxation of
$\langle m^z_s\rangle$ toward its value the spontaneously symmetry-broken
state, followed by a size-dependent final decay to zero. We develop a generic
finite-size scaling theory which shows that the relaxation time diverges
asymptotically as $L^z$ where $z$ is the dynamic exponent of the low energy
excitations. We use the scaling theory to develop a way of extracting the
dynamic exponent from the numerical finite-size data. We apply the method to
spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnets on two different lattice geometries; the
two-dimensional (2D) square lattice as well as a site-diluted square lattice at
the percolation threshold. In the 2D case we obtain $z=2.001(5)$, which is
consistent with the known value $z=2$, while for the site-dilutes lattice we
find $z=3.90(1)$. This is an improvement on previous estimates of $z\approx
3.7$. The scaling results also show a fundamental difference between the two
cases: In the 2D system the data can be collapsed onto a common scaling
function even when $\langle m^z_s\rangle$ is relatively large, reflecting the
Anderson tower of quantum rotor states with a common dynamic exponent $z=2$.
For the diluted lattice, the scaling works only for small $\langle
m^z_s\rangle$, indicating a mixture of different relaxation time scaling
between the low energy states.

  The main reason for the dominance of these algorithms is their good

are not just failures of computer codes, but may be real. The existence of one

indicate dark neutron star formation without a supernova or supernova remnant.

throughout the porous material, based on thermodynamic parameters derived from
Rosetta observations. Two possibilities are considered: either, to account for
its bilobate shape, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was assembled from two primordial
~2 kilometer-sized planetesimals, or it resulted from the disruption of a
larger parent body with a size corresponding to that of comet Hale-Bopp (~70
km). To fully preserve its volatile content, we find that either
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's formation was delayed between ~2.2 and 7.7 Myr
after that of Ca-Al-rich Inclusions in the protosolar nebula or the comet's

change can be both discrete and instantaneous, or continuous over time. In
addition, it is required that each state on the trajectory induced by the
execution of plans complies with a given set of global constraints. We approach
the computation of plans for such domains as the problem of searching over a
deterministic state model. In this model, some of the successor states are
obtained by solving numerically the so-called initial value problem over a set
of ordinary differential equations (ODE) given by the current plan prefix.
These equations hold over time intervals whose duration is determined
dynamically, according to whether zero crossing events take place for a set of
invariant conditions. The resulting planner, FS+, incorporates these features
together with effective heuristic guidance. FS+ does not impose any of the
syntactic restrictions on process effects often found on the existing
literature on Hybrid Planning. A key concept of our approach is that a clear
separation is struck between planning and simulation time steps. The former is
the time allowed to observe the evolution of a given dynamical system before
committing to a future course of action, whilst the later is part of the model
of the environment. FS+ is shown to be a robust planner over a diverse set of
hybrid domains, taken from the existing literature on hybrid planning and

measurement. In the model, the scalar potential has two minima where the scalar
field has vacuum expectation values of 246 GeV and the Planck mass $\simeq
2.44\times 10^{18}$ GeV, the latter of which is realized by considering a
classically scale invariant setup and requiring that the scalar quartic
coupling and its beta function vanish at the Planck scale. The Standard Model
Higgs field is a mixture of an elementary scalar and composite scalars in a new
strongly-coupled gauge theory, and the strong dynamics gives rise to the
negative mass for the SM Higgs field, and at the same time, causes separation
of the SM Higgs quartic coupling and the quartic coupling for the elementary
scalar, which leads to the vanshing of the latter quartic coupling and its beta
function at the Planck scale. The model predicts new scalar particles with
about 300 GeV mass possessing electroweak charges and Yukawa-type couplings
with Standard Model fermions, and a new light gauge boson that couples to
Standard Model fermions.

shape our understanding on amorphous (a-) networks. Based on ab-intio
calculations and reverse Monte Carlo simulations of experiments, we
surprisingly find that even though the severe chemical disorder in a-GeTe
undermined the prevailing medium range order (MRO) picture, it is responsible
for the experimentally observed MRO. That this thing could happen depends on a
novel atomic packing scheme. And this scheme results in a kind of homopolar
bond chain-like polyhedral clusters. Within this scheme, the formation of
homopolar bonds can be well explained by an electron-counting model and further
validated by quantitative bond energy analysis based. Our study suggests that
the underlying physics for chemical disorder in a-GeTe is intrinsic and
universal to all severely chemically disordered covalent glasses.

January 2000 to June 2016.
  Methods: The correlations between GBS, dengue, Multivariate El Nino Southern
Oscillation Index (MEI) and local meteorological data were explored by the
Spearman Rank correlations and cross-correlations between these time series.
Poisson regression models were fitted to identify nonlinear associations
between MEI and dengue. Cross wavelet analysis was applied to infer potential
non-stationary oscillating associations among MEI, dengue and GBS.
  Findings : An increasing trend was found for both GBS cases and imported
dengue cases in Hong Kong. We found a weak but statistically significant
negative correlation between GBS and local meteorological factors. MEI
explained over 12\% of dengue's variations from Poisson regression models.
Wavelet analyses showed that there is possible non-stationary oscillating

gradual process, the proposed network can simplify the direct SR problem to
multistep easier upsampling tasks with very small magnification factor in each

proposed training process, an initial network can be easily trained with

contrast dark field (DF) within the science image to a high degree of precision
(10^-10). Current approaches aimed at establishing the DF, such as electric
field conjugation (EFC), have been demonstrated in the lab and have proven
capable of high contrast DF generation. The same approaches have been
considered for the maintenance of the DF as well. However, these methods rely
on phase diversity measurements which require field modulation; this interrupts
the DF and consequently competes with the science acquisition. In this paper,
we introduce and demonstrate spatial linear dark field control (LDFC) as an
alternative technique by which the high contrast DF can be maintained without
modulation. Once the DF has been established by conventional EFC, spatial LDFC
locks the high contrast state of the DF by operating a closed-loop around the
linear response of the bright field (BF) to wavefront variations that modify
both the BF and the DF. We describe here the fundamental operating principles
of spatial LDFC and provide numerical simulations of its operation as a DF
stabilization technique that is capable of wavefront correction within the DF
without interrupting science acquisition.

we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference

rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in
the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a
variational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's
applicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our
experimental results show that our method converges much faster than the

Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) show connections of EBs and IRIS bombs (IBs),
implying that EBs might be heated to a much higher temperature ($8\times10^{4}$
K) than previous results. Here we perform a spectral analysis of the EBs
simultaneously observed by the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) and IRIS.
The observational results show clear evidence of heating in the lower
atmosphere, indicated by the wing enhancement in H$\alpha$, Ca II 8542 \r{A}
and Mg II triplet lines, and also by brightenings in the images of 1700 \r{A}
and 2832 \r{A} ultraviolet continuum channels. Additionally, the Mg II triplet
line intensity is correlated with that of H$\alpha$ when the EB occurs,
indicating the possibility to use the triplet as an alternative way to identify
EBs. However, we do not find any signal in IRIS hotter lines (C II and Si IV).
For further analysis, we employ a two-cloud model to fit the two chromospheric
lines (H$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 \r{A}) simultaneously, and obtain a temperature
enhancement of 2300 K for a strong EB. This temperature is among the highest of
previous modeling results while still insufficient to produce IB signatures at
ultraviolet wavelengths.

The results of such investigations, presented here, indicates that for cobalt

solving large scattered data interpolation problems. However, in order to
achieve a good accuracy, the question about how many points we have to consider

answered. Moreover, it is well-known that also the shape parameter affects the
accuracy of the local RBF approximants and, as a consequence, of the PU

evident from extensive numerical experiments and applications provided in the

understanding the critical behaviors and underlying mechanism of discontinuous
percolation transitions induced by cascade dynamics. When the contagion spreads
from a single seed, a cluster of infected and recovered nodes grows without any
cluster merging process. However, when the contagion starts from multiple seeds
of $O(N)$ where $N$ is the system size, a node weakened by a seed can be
infected more easily when it is in contact with another node infected by a
different pathogen seed. This contagion process can be viewed as a cluster
merging process in a percolation model. Here, we show analytically and
numerically that when the density of infectious seeds is relatively small but
$O(1)$, the epidemic transition is hybrid, exhibiting both continuous and
discontinuous behavior, whereas when it is sufficiently large and reaches a
critical point, the transition becomes continuous. We determine the full set of
critical exponents describing the hybrid and the continuous transitions. Their
critical behaviors differ from those in the single-seed case.

particular, the ""database-as-a-service"" paradigm has become mainstream. While
existing multi-tenant data management systems focus on single-tenant query
processing, we believe that it is time to rethink how queries can be processed
across multiple tenants in such a way that we do not only gain more valuable
insights, but also at minimal cost. As we will argue in this paper, standard
SQL semantics are insufficient to process cross-tenant queries in an
unambiguous way, which is why existing systems use other, expensive means like
ETL or data integration. We first propose MTSQL, a set of extensions to
standard SQL, which fixes the ambiguity problem. Next, we present MTBase, a
query processing middleware that efficiently processes MTSQL on top of SQL. As
we will see, there is a canonical, provably correct, rewrite algorithm from
MTSQL to SQL, which may however result in poor query execution performance,
even on high-performance database products. We further show that with
carefully-designed optimizations, execution times can be reduced in such ways
that the difference to single-tenant queries becomes marginal.

that a large superconducting gap associated with the interfacial

sample of 88 main-sequence and evolved stars to reveal signatures of
Jupiter-mass planets in the solar-age and solar-metallicity open cluster M67.
We aim at studying the frequency of giant planets in this cluster with respect
to the field stars. In addition, our sample is also ideal to perform a
long-term study to compare the chemical composition of stars with and without
giant planets in detail. We analyzed precise radial velocity (RV) measurements
obtained with five different instruments. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations
to estimate the occurrence rate of giant planets in our radial velocity survey.
All the planets previously announced in this RV campaign with their properties
are summarized here: 3 hot Jupiters around the main-sequence stars YBP1194,
YBP1514, and YBP401, and 1 giant planet around the evolved star S364. Two
additional planet candidates around the stars YBP778 and S978 are also analyzed
in the present work. We discuss stars that exhibit large RV variability or
trends individually. For 2 additional stars, long-term trends are compatible
with new binary candidates or substellar objects, which increases the total
number of binary candidates detected in our campaign to 14. Based on the
Doppler-detected planets discovered in this survey, we find an occurrence of
giant planets of ~18.0%(+12.0/-8.0%) in the selected period-mass range. This
frequency is slightly higher but consistent within the errors with the estimate
for the field stars, which leads to the general conclusion that open cluster
and field statistics agree. However, we find that the rate of hot Jupiters in
the cluster (~5.7%(+5.5/-3.0%)) is substantially higher than in the field.

Reflecting all these facets and at the same time measuring everything related

  We investigate if and to what extent it is possible to build a focused
quality model with similar evaluation results as a comprehensive quality model
but with far less measures needed to be collected and, hence, reduced effort.
We make quality evaluations with the comprehensive Quamoco base quality model
and build focused quality models based on the same set of measures and data
from over 2,000 open source systems. We analyse the ability of the focused
model to predict the results of the Quamoco model by comparing them with a
random predictor as a baseline. We calculate the standardised accuracy measure
SA and effect sizes.
  We found that for the Quamoco model and its 378 automatically collected
measures, we can build a focused model with only 10 measures but an accuracy of
61% and a medium to high effect size. We conclude that we can build focused
quality models to get an impression of a system's quality similar to
comprehensive models. However, when including manually collected measures, the
accuracy of the models stayed below 50%. Hence, manual measures seem to have a
high impact and should therefore not be ignored in a focused model.

could be modeled as a node's discoverability on some properly defined network,
and all of the previously mentioned phenomena can be commonly stated as a
target node wants to be discovered easily by the other nodes in the network. In
this work, we explicitly define a node's discoverability in a network, and
formulate a general node discoverability optimization problem, where the goal
is to create a budgeted set of incoming edges to the target node so as to
optimize the target node's discoverability in the network. Although the
optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard, we find that the defined
discoverability measures have good properties that enable us to use a greedy
algorithm to find provably near-optimal solutions. The computational complexity
of a greedy algorithm is dominated by the time cost of an oracle call, i.e.,
calculating the marginal gain of a node. To scale up the oracle call over large
networks, we propose an estimation-and-refinement approach, that provides a
good trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.
Experiments conducted on real-world networks demonstrate that our method is
thousands of times faster than an exact method using dynamic programming,
thereby allowing us to solve the node discoverability optimization problem on
large networks.

thought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and non-relativistic dark
matter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and its dark matter halo.
In the local Universe, the mass of dark matter within a galactic disk increases
with disk radius, becoming appreciable and then dominant in the outer, baryonic
regions of the disks of star-forming galaxies. This results in rotation
velocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or
increasing with disk radius. Comparison between the dynamical mass and the sum
of stellar and cold gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation, inferred
from ancillary data, suggest high baryon factions in the inner, star-forming
regions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than
in the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (stellar initial mass
function, calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in
terms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves for the outer
disks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation
velocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this
trend arises because of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the
massive, high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon dominated, with
dark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the
large velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial
pressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing
radius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift.
Qualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early Universe
efficiently condensed at the centres of dark matter halos when gas fractions
were high, and dark matter was less concentrated. [Abridged]

Mechanics, canonical transformations in Quantum Field Theory are mathematically
more subtle due to the existence of unitarily inequivalent representations of
canonical commutation relations. When one works with functional integrals, it
is not immediately clear how this algebraic feature manifests itself in the
formalism. Here we attack this issue by considering the canonical
transformations in the context of coherent-state functional integrals.
Specifically, in the case of linear canonical transformations, we derive the
general functional-integral representations for both transition amplitude and
partition function phrased in terms of new canonical variables. By means of
this, we show how in the infinite-volume limit the canonical transformations
induce a transition from one representation of canonical commutation relations
to another one and under what conditions the representations are unitarily
inequivalent. We also consider the partition function and derive the energy gap
between statistical systems described in two different representations which,
among others, allows to establish a connection with continuous phase
transitions. We illustrate the inner workings of the outlined mechanism by
discussing two prototypical systems: the van Hove model and the Bogoliubov
model of weakly interacting Bose gas.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to its adoption as an integral
component in many applications, including banking, medical diagnosis, and
driverless cars. To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services
offered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service
tools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to
adversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the
classifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that
adversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another
classifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different
architectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is
known as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box
systems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and
transferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to
protect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block
their transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the
input is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on
the original label and instead predicts that the input is ""invalid"". In
essence, we augment the output class set with a NULL label and train the
classifier to reject the adversarial examples by classifying them as NULL. In
experiments, we apply a wide range of attacks based on adversarial examples on
the black-box systems. We show that a classifier trained with the proposed
method effectively resists against the adversarial examples, while maintaining
the accuracy on clean data.

and highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGN). We used all available
archival \textit{XMM-Newton} data, and estimated the time-lags following
Epitropakis \& Papadakis (2016). By performing extensive numerical simulations,
we arrived at useful guidelines for computing intrinsic coherence estimates
that are minimally biased, have known errors, and are (approximately) Gaussian
distributed. Owing to the way we estimated the time-lags and intrinsic
coherence, we were able to do a proper model fitting to the data. Regarding the
continuum time-lags, we are able to demonstrate that they have a power-law
dependence on frequency, with a slope of $-1$, and that their amplitude scales
with the logarithm of the light-curve mean-energy ratio. We also find that
their amplitude increases with the square root of the X-ray Eddington ratio.
Regarding the intrinsic coherence, we found that it is approximately constant
at low frequencies. It then decreases exponentially at frequencies higher than
a characteristic `break frequency.' Both the low-frequency constant
intrinsic-coherence value and the break frequency have a logarithmic dependence
on the light-curve mean-energy ratio. Neither the low-frequency constant
intrinsic-coherence value, nor the break frequency exhibit a universal scaling
with either the central black hole mass, or the the X-ray Eddington ratio. Our

low-luminosity young objects, comprising (proto-)brown dwarfs, first

bolometric luminosities lower than 0.4 L$_\odot$. Water maser emission is a
good tracer of energetic processes, such as mass-loss and/or accretion, and is
a useful tool to study this processes with very high angular resolution. This
type of emission has been confirmed in objects with L$_{\rm bol}\ge 1$
L$_\odot$. Objects with lower luminosities also undergo mass-loss and
accretion, and thus, are prospective sites of maser emission. Our sensitive
single-dish observations provided a single detection when pointing toward the
FHC L1448 IRS 2E. However, follow-up interferometric observations showed water
maser emission associated with the nearby YSO L1448 IRS 2 { (a Class 0
protostar of L$_{\rm bol}\simeq 3.6-5.3$ L$_\odot$)}, and did not find any
emission toward L1448 IRS 2E. The upper limits for water maser emission
determined by our observations are one order of magnitude lower than expected
from the correlation between water maser luminosities and bolometric
luminosities found for YSOs. This suggests that this correlation does not hold
at the lower end of the (sub)stellar mass spectrum. Possible reasons are that
the slope of this correlation is steeper at L$_{\rm bol}\le 1$ L$_\odot$, or
that there is an absolute luminosity threshold below which water maser emission
cannot be produced. Alternatively, if the correlation still stands at low
luminosity, the detection rates of masers would be significantly lower than the
values obtained in higher-luminosity Class 0 protostars.

powerful line of argument in favour of quantum gravity considers models of
hybrid systems consisting of coupled quantum-classical sectors. The conclusion
is that such models are inconsistent: either the quantum sector's defining
properties necessarily spread to the classical sector, or they are violated.
These arguments have a long history, starting with the debates about the
quantum nature of the electromagnetic fields in the early days of quantum
theory. Yet, they have limited scope because they rely on particular dynamical
models obeying restrictive conditions, such as unitarity. In this paper we
propose a radically new, more general argument, relying on less restrictive
assumptions. The key feature is an information-theoretic characterisation of
both sectors, including their interaction, via constraints on copying
operations. These operations are necessary for the existence of observables in
any physical theory, because they constitute the most general representation of
measurement interactions. Remarkably, our argument is formulated without
resorting to particular dynamical models, thus being applicable to any hybrid
system, even those ruled by ""post-quantum"" theories. Its conclusion is also
compatible with partially quantum systems, such as those that exhibit features
like complementarity, but may lack others, such as entanglement. As an example,
we consider a hybrid system of qubits and rebits. Surprisingly, despite the
rebit's lack of complex amplitudes, the signature quantum protocols such as
teleportation are still possible.

intuitively one assumes that features which are good for reconstruction will
also lead to high classification accuracy. Indeed, it became research practice
and is a suggested strategy by introductory books. However, we prove that this
is not always the case. We thoroughly investigate the quality of features
produced by Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoders when trained to reconstruct

and classification capabilities of the network, if we were to use the same
features for both tasks. Experimental results suggest that in fact, there is no
correlation between the reconstruction score and the quality of features for a
classification task. This means, more formally, that the sub-dimension
representation space learned from the Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (while
being trained for input reconstruction) is not necessarily better separable
than the initial input space. Furthermore, we show that the reconstruction
error is not a good metric to assess the quality of features, because it is
biased by the decoder quality. We do not question the usefulness of
pre-training, but we conclude that aiming for the lowest reconstruction error

density and redshift, we applied weighting to normalise the corresponding
distributions of galaxy populations in each bin. After the normalisation with
respect to environment density and redshift, several residual dependencies of
galaxy properties still remain. Most notable is the trend of morphology
transformations, resulting in a higher elliptical-to-spiral ratio while moving
from voids towards filament spines, bringing along a corresponding increase in
the $g-i$ colour index and a decrease in star formation rate. After separating
elliptical and spiral subsamples, some of the colour index and star formation
rate evolution still remains. The mentioned trends are characteristic only for
galaxies brighter than about $M_{r} = -20$ mag. Unlike some other recent
studies, we do not witness an increase in the galaxy stellar mass while
approaching filaments. The detected transformations can be explained by an
increase in the galaxy-galaxy merger rate and/or the cut-off of extragalactic
gas supplies (starvation) near and inside filaments. Unlike voids, large-scale
galaxy filaments are not a mere density enhancement, but have their own
specific impact on the constituent galaxies, reducing the star formation rate
and raising the chances of elliptical morphology also at a fixed environment
density level.

a successful treatment outcome for patients in a clinical trial by skewing the
allocation probability towards better performing treatments as data
accumulates. There is considerable interest in using RAR designs in drug
development for rare diseases, where traditional designs are not feasible or
ethically objectionable. In this paper we discuss and address a major criticism
of RAR: the undesirable type I error inflation due to unknown time trends in
the trial. Time trends can appear because of changes in the characteristics of
recruited patients - so-called ""patient drift"". Patient drift is a realistic
concern for clinical trials in rare diseases because these typically recruit
patients over a very long period of time. We compute by simulations how large
the type I error inflation is as a function of the time trend magnitude in
order to determine in which contexts a potentially costly correction is
actually necessary. We then assess the ability of different correction methods
to preserve type I error in this context and their performance in terms of
other operating characteristics, including patient benefit and power. We make
recommendations of which correction methods are most suitable in the rare
disease context for several RAR rules, differentiating between the two-armed
and the multi-armed case. We further propose a RAR design for multi-armed
clinical trials, which is computationally cheap and robust to several time
trends considered.

hospitalization and mortality. Influenza vaccination has shown substantial
protective effectiveness in the United States. We investigated state-level
patterns of coverage rates of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination,
among the overall population in the U.S. and specifically among children and
the elderly, from 2009/10 to 2014/15, and associations with ecological factors.
Methods and Findings: We obtained state-level influenza vaccination coverage
rates from national surveys, and state-level socio-demographic and health data
from a variety of sources. We employed a retrospective ecological study design,
and used mixed-model regression to determine the levels of ecological
association of the state-level vaccinations rates with these factors, both with
and without region as a factor for the three populations. We found that
health-care access is positively and significantly associated with mean
influenza vaccination coverage rates across all populations and models. We also
found that prevalence of asthma in adults are negatively and significantly
associated with mean influenza vaccination coverage rates in the elderly
populations. Conclusions: Health-care access has a robust, positive association
with state-level vaccination rates across different populations. This
highlights a potential population-level advantage of expanding health-care
access.

The second stage, comprised of a fully-convolutional deep network, exploits the
local context in the localised lumbar region to segment and label the lumbar
vertebrae in one go. Aided with practical data augmentation for training, our
approach is highly generalisable, capable of successfully segmenting both
healthy and abnormal vertebrae (fractured and scoliotic spines). We
consistently achieve an average Dice coefficient of over 90 percent on a

  The present study provides more robust and universal characterisation of
breaking in transitional water than the empirical non-dimensionalisation of
Nelson (1994). The limiting wave height to water depth ratios of marginally
breaking deep and intermediate water waves remain within 10 % of Nelson's
values. However, it is shown that the effect of wave grouping can produce waves
in shallower water that are at least 30 % greater in height than the limit
proposed by Nelson (1994). The present study supports use of limits based on
McCowan (1894) and Miche (1944) for coastal engineering design for marginal
breaking waves. Three-dimensional and more strongly breaking waves in shallower
water may yield wave heights higher than those measured during this study.

understand their formation. These models have widely used dry and/or moist
adiabats to extrapolate temperatures from the measured values in the upper
troposphere down to the level where the thermochemical equilibrium between
H$_2$O and CO is established. The mean molecular mass gradient produced by the
condensation of H$_2$O stabilizes the atmosphere against convection and results
in a vertical thermal profile and H$_2$O distribution that departs
significantly from previous estimates. We revisit O/H estimates using an
atmospheric structure that accounts for the inhibition of the convection by

satisfy both these new estimates of the thermal profile and the observations.

processes, cooperating to control the same cognitive system, assist each other
in overcoming bottlenecks encountered during their internal processing.
Cognitive synergy has been posited as a key feature of real-world general
intelligence, and has been used explicitly in the design of the OpenCog
cognitive architecture. Here category theory and related concepts are used to
give a formalization of the cognitive synergy concept.
  A series of formal models of intelligent agents is proposed, with increasing
specificity and complexity: simple reinforcement learning agents; ""cognit""
agents with an abstract memory and processing model; hypergraph-based agents
(in which ""cognit"" operations are carried out via hypergraphs); hypergraph
agents with a rich language of nodes and hyperlinks (such as the OpenCog
framework provides); ""PGMC"" agents whose rich hypergraphs are endowed with
cognitive processes guided via Probabilistic Growth and Mining of Combinations;
and finally variations of the PrimeAGI design, which is currently being built
on top of OpenCog.
  A notion of cognitive synergy is developed for cognitive processes acting
within PGMC agents, based on developing a formal notion of ""stuckness,"" and
defining synergy as a relationship between cognitive processes in which they
can help each other out when they get stuck. It is proposed that cognitive
processes relating to each other synergetically, associate in a certain way
with functors that map into each other via natural transformations. Cognitive
synergy is proposed to correspond to a certain inequality regarding the
relative costs of different paths through certain commutation diagrams.
  Applications of this notion of cognitive synergy to particular cognitive
phenomena, and specific cognitive processes in the PrimeAGI design, are
discussed.

shift interpretation that favored a single-fluid scenario will be reviewed, as
well as recent experiments that reported its failure. Thereafter, based on
literature shift data for planar Cu a contrasting shift phenomenology for
cuprate superconductors is developed, which is very different from the early
view while being in agreement with all published data. For example, it will be
shown that the hitherto used hyperfine scenario is inadequate as a large
isotropic shift component is discovered. Furthermore, the changes of the
temperature dependences of the shifts above and below the superconducting
transitions temperature proceed according to a few rules that were not
discussed before. It appears that there can be substantial spin shift at the
lowest temperature if the magnetic field lies in the CuO$_2$ plane, which
points to a localization of spin in the $3d(x^2-y^2)$ orbital. A simple model
is presented based on the most fundamental findings. The analysis must have new

anonymous, identical finite state agents. A protocol is well-specified if from
every initial configuration, all fair executions reach a common consensus. The
central verification question for population protocols is the
well-specification problem: deciding if a given protocol is well-specified.
Esparza et al. have recently shown that this problem is decidable, but with
very high complexity: it is at least as hard as the Petri net reachability
problem, which is EXPSPACE-hard, and for which only algorithms of non-primitive
recursive complexity are currently known.
  In this paper we introduce the class WS3 of well-specified strongly-silent
protocols and we prove that it is suitable for automatic verification. More
precisely, we show that WS3 has the same computational power as general
well-specified protocols, and captures standard protocols from the literature.
Moreover, we show that the membership problem for WS3 reduces to solving
boolean combinations of linear constraints over N. This allowed us to develop
the first software able to automatically prove well-specification for all of

natural language, logical semantics, perception and action are represented
categorically, and symbol grounding is modeled via the composition of morphisms
between the relevant categories. This model gives conceptual insight into the
fundamentally systematic nature of symbol grounding, and also connects
naturally to practical real-world AI systems in current research and commercial
use. Specifically, it is argued that the structure of linguistic syntax can be
modeled as a certain asymmetric monoidal category, as e.g. implicit in the link
grammar formalism; the structure of spatiotemporal relationships and action
plans can be modeled similarly using ""image grammars"" and ""action grammars"";
and common-sense logical semantic structure can be modeled using
dependently-typed lambda calculus with uncertain truth values. Given these
formalisms, the grounding of linguistic descriptions in spatiotemporal
perceptions and coordinated actions consists of following morphisms from
language to logic through to spacetime and body (for comprehension), and vice
versa (for generation). The mapping is indicated between the spatial
relationships in the Region Connection Calculus and Allen Interval Algebra and
corresponding entries in the link grammar syntax parsing dictionary. Further,
the abstractions introduced here are shown to naturally model the structures

stabilization term which provides control of the jumps in the derivatives of
the finite element functions across faces in the vicinity of the boundary. We
then develop the basic theoretical results including error estimates and
estimates of the condition number of the mass and stiffness matrices. We apply
the method to the standard displacement problem, the frequency response
problem, and the eigenvalue problem. We present several numerical examples
including studies of thin bending dominated structures relevant for engineering
applications. Finally, we develop a cut finite element method for fibre
reinforced materials where the fibres are modeled as a superposition of a truss
and a Euler-Bernoulli beam. The beam model leads to a fourth order problem
which we discretize using the restriction of the bulk finite element space to
the fibre together with a continuous/discontinuous finite element formulation.
Here the bulk material stabilizes the problem and it is not necessary to add
additional stabilization terms.

this mechanism, we demonstrate how an existing vortex with a specific
topological charge can be inverted to the oppositely charged state, and how the
charge state of one reference vortex can be copied to a neighboring vortex.
This way we can optically encode any set of binary information onto a chain of

the possibility to address and manipulate each vortex in the chain

together by magnetic forces and able to perform two minimal mechanical
operations (or movements): \emph{rotate} around a neighbor and \emph{slide}
over a line. In terms of modeling, there are $n$ nodes arranged in a
2-dimensional grid and forming some initial \emph{shape}. The goal is for the
initial shape $A$ to \emph{transform} to some target shape $B$ by a sequence of
movements. Most of the paper focuses on \emph{transformability} questions,
meaning whether it is in principle feasible to transform a given shape to
another. We first consider the case in which only rotation is available to the
nodes. Our main result is that deciding whether two given shapes $A$ and $B$
can be transformed to each other, is in $\mathbf{P}$. We then insist on
rotation only and impose the restriction that the nodes must maintain global
connectivity throughout the transformation. We prove that the corresponding
transformability question is in $\mathbf{PSPACE}$ and study the problem of
determining the minimum \emph{seeds} that can make feasible, otherwise
infeasible transformations. Next we allow both rotations and slidings and prove
universality: any two connected shapes $A,B$ of the same order, can be
transformed to each other without breaking connectivity. The worst-case number
of movements of the generic strategy is $\Omega(n^2)$. We improve this to
$O(n)$ parallel time, by a pipelining strategy, and prove optimality of both by
matching lower bounds. In the last part of the paper, we turn our attention to
distributed transformations. The nodes are now distributed processes able to
perform communicate-compute-move rounds. We provide distributed algorithms for

systems in which robustness against inclusion of new elements is an essential
feature. A recently proposed simple model has revealed a general mechanism by
which such systems can become robust against inclusion of elements with random
interactions when the elements have a moderate number of links. This happens as
a result of two opposing effects such that while the inclusion of elements with
more interactions makes each individual element more robust against
disturbances, it also increases the net impact of the loss of any element in
the system. The interaction is, however, in many systems often intrinsically
bidirectional like for mutual symbiosis, competition in ecology, and the
action-reaction law of Newtonian mechanics, etc. This study reports the strong
reinforcement effect of the bidirectionality of the interactions on the
robustness of evolving systems. We show that the system with purely
bidirectional interactions can grow with two-fold average degree, in comparison
with the purely unidirectional system. This drastic shift of the transition
point comes from the reinforcement of each node, not from a change in structure
of the emergent system. For systems with partially bidirectional interactions
we find that the area of the growing phase gets expanded. In the dense
interaction regime, there exists an optimum proportion of bidirectional
interactions for the growth rate at around $1/3$. In the sparsely connected
systems, small but finite fraction of bidirectional links can change the
system's behaviour from non-growing to growing behaviour.

persistence homology to detect and quantify topological patterns that appear in

point cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect
transient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence.
This is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a 'persistence
landscapes'. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via
their $L^p$-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series
generated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in
the vicinity of financial meltdowns, the $L^p$-norms exhibit strong growth
prior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the
average spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of $L^p$-norms
of the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250

dispersion is generally different from the dispersion associated with the

obtained with an arbitrarily low energy dissipation, in contrast to the

achievement, we provide an exact expression for the dispersion related to the

on a NaCl(001) surface within the nearly non-invasive region by a qPlus-based
noncontact atomic force microscopy. Comparison with theoretical simulations
reveals that the key lies in probing the weak high-order electrostatic force
between the quadrupole-like CO-terminated tip and the polar water molecules at
large tip-water distances. This interaction allows the imaging and structural
determination of the weakly bonded water clusters and even of their metastable
states without inducing any disturbance. This work may open up new possibility
of studying the intrinsic structure and electrostatics of ice or water on bulk
insulating surfaces, ion hydration and biological water with atomic precision.

dimensional confined active viscoelastic gel. We show that the dynamics of a
point inclusion can be described by a Langevin equation with a confining
potential and multiplicative noise. Using a systematic adiabatic elimination
over the fast variables, we arrive at an overdamped equation with a proper
definition of the multiplicative noise. To highlight various features and to
appeal to different biological contexts, we treat the inclusion in turn as a
rigid extended element, an elastic element and a viscoelastic (Kelvin-Voigt)
element. The dynamics for the shape and position of the extended inclusion can
be described by coupled Langevin equations. Deriving exact expressions for the
corresponding steady state probability distributions, we find that the active
noise induces an attraction to the edges of the confining domain. In the
presence of a competing centering force, we find that the shape of the
probability distribution exhibits a sharp transition upon varying the amplitude
of the active noise. Our results could help understanding the positioning and
deformability of biological inclusions, eg. organelles in cells, or nucleus and

opportunities to study solar flares over a range of wavelengths. Significant
advances in our understanding of flare physics often come from coordinated
observations between multiple instruments. Consequently, considerable efforts
have been, and continue to be made to coordinate observations among instruments
(e.g. through the Max Millennium Program of Solar Flare Research). However,
there has been no study to date that quantifies how many flares have been
observed by combinations of various instruments. Here we describe a technique
that retrospectively searches archival databases for flares jointly observed by
RHESSI, SDO/EVE (MEGS-A and -B), Hinode/(EIS, SOT, and XRT), and IRIS. Out of
the 6953 flares of GOES magnitude C1 or greater that we consider over the 6.5
years after the launch of SDO, 40 have been observed by six or more instruments
simultaneously. Using each instrument's individual rate of success in observing
flares, we show that the numbers of flares co-observed by three or more
instruments are higher than the number expected under the assumption that the
instruments operated independently of one another. In particular, the number of
flares observed by larger numbers of instruments is much higher than expected.
Our study illustrates that these missions often acted in cooperation, or at
least had aligned goals. We also provide details on an interactive widget now
available in SSWIDL that allows a user to search for flaring events that have
been observed by a chosen set of instruments. This provides access to a broader
range of events in order to answer specific science questions. The difficulty
in scheduling coordinated observations for solar-flare research is discussed
with respect to instruments projected to begin operations during Solar Cycle
25, such as DKIST, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe.

effective, we first introduce the concept of higher-order bit-flips, and
propose a new metric to determine the bit-flips that are more likely to correct
the trajectory of the SC decoding. We then propose a generalized SCFlip
decoding algorithm, referred to as Dynamic-SCFlip (D-SCFlip), which dynamically
builds a list of candidate bit-flips, while guaranteeing that extra decoding
attempts are performed by decreasing probability of success. Simulation results
show that D-SCFlip is an effective alternative to SC-List decoding of polar
codes, by providing very good error correcting performance, with an average
computation complexity close to the one of the SC decoder.

interest as the coupling of the heavy states to the Standard Model, that are
integrated out to generate neutrino masses, are through flavour space vectors

systematically developed as a perturbation around the unknown eigenvectors
diagonalizing the charged lepton mass matrix using the fact that these
eigenvectors also form a basis of $\mathbb{C}^3$. This point holds in seesaw
models and can also be applied to other models of neutrino mass generation to
develop systematic expansions. We develop the algebra for this flavour space

key component of many quantum information experiments. One key limitation which
has not been well predicted by theory is the gain saturation behavior which
determines its ability to process large amplitude signals. The typical
explanation for this behavior in phase-preserving amplifiers based on
three-wave mixing is pump depletion, in which the consumption of pump photons
to produce amplification results in a reduction in gain. However, in this work
we present experimental data and theoretical calculations showing that the
fourth-order Kerr nonlinearities inherent in the Josephson junctions are the
dominant factor in the Josephson Parametric Converter (JPC). The Kerr-based
theory has the unusual property of causing saturation to both lower and higher
gains, depending on bias conditions. This work presents a new methodology for
optimizing device performance in the presence of Kerr nonlinearities while
retaining device tunability, and points to the necessity of controlling
higher-order Hamiltonian terms to make further improvements in parametric
devices.

quasiparticles: excitations in strongly interacting matter behaving like weakly
interacting particles in free space. Quasiparticles in metals are very robust
objects. Yet, when a system's ground state undergoes a qualitative change at a
quantum critical point (QCP), the quasiparticles may disintegrate and give way
to an exotic quantum-fluid state of matter. The nature of this breakdown is
intensely debated, because the emergent quantum fluid dominates the material
properties up to high temperature and might even be related to the occurence of
superconductivity in some compounds. Here we trace the dynamics of
heavy-fermion quasiparticles in CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_{x}$ and monitor their
evolution towards the QCP in time-resolved experiments, supported by many-body
calculations. A terahertz pulse disrupts the many-body heavy-fermion state.
Under emission of a delayed, phase-coherent terahertz reflex the heavy-fermion
state recovers, with a coherence time 100 times longer than typically
associated with correlated metals. The quasiparticle weight collapses towards
the QCP, yet its formation temperature remains constant -- phenomena believed
to be mutually exclusive. Coexistence in the same experiment calls for
revisions in our view on quantum criticality.

We use an optimal control formulation, in which the velocity field of a
hyperbolic PDE needs to be found such that the distance between the final state
of the system (the transformed/transported template image) and the observation
(the reference image) is minimized. Our solver supports both stationary and
non-stationary (i.e., transient or time-dependent) velocity fields. As
transformation models, we consider both the transport equation (assuming
intensities are preserved during the deformation) and the continuity equation
(assuming mass-preservation).
  We consider the reduced form of the optimal control problem and solve the
resulting unconstrained optimization problem using a discretize-then-optimize
approach. A key contribution is the elimination of the PDE constraint using a
Lagrangian hyperbolic PDE solver. Lagrangian methods rely on the concept of
characteristic curves that we approximate here using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta
method. We also present an efficient algorithm for computing the derivatives of
final state of the system with respect to the velocity field. This allows us to
use fast Gauss-Newton based methods. We present quickly converging iterative
linear solvers using spectral preconditioners that render the overall
optimization efficient and scalable. Our method is embedded into the image
registration framework FAIR and, thus, supports the most commonly used
similarity measures and regularization functionals. We demonstrate the

always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not

can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The

continuous global optimization problem inside $[0,1]^n$, for example in
physical realizations like adiabatic quantum computers. However, the number of
local minima usually grows exponentially. Reducing to degree 2 polynomial plus
constraints of being in $\{0,1\}^n$, we get geometric formulations as the
question if plane or sphere intersects with $\{0,1\}^n$. There will be also

for these decays can be achieved in an extended MSSM model with an additional
vector like quark generation. Specifically we show that in the extended model
one can achieve branching ratios for $t\to h^0 c$ and $t\to h^0 u$ as large as
the current experimental upper limits given by the ATLAS and the CMS

again one finds that the branching ratio for these decays can be as large as
$O(1)\%$. The analysis is done with inclusion of the CP phases in the Higgs
sector, and the effect of CP phases on the branching ratios is investigated.
Specifically the Higgs sector spectrum and mixings are computed involving
quarks and mirror quarks, squarks and mirror squarks in the loops consistent
with the Higgs boson mass constraint. The resulting effective Lagrangian with
inclusion of the vector like quark generation induce flavor violating decays at
the tree level. The test of the branching ratios predicted could come with

been capable of achieving impressive results in a variety of application areas

translation. However this success in modelling short term dependencies has not
successfully transitioned to application areas such as trajectory prediction,
which require capturing both short term and long term relationships. In this
paper, we propose a Tree Memory Network (TMN) for modelling long term and short
term relationships in sequence-to-sequence mapping problems. The proposed
network architecture is composed of an input module, controller and a memory
module. In contrast to related literature, which models the memory as a
sequence of historical states, we model the memory as a recursive tree
structure. This structure more effectively captures temporal dependencies
across both short term and long term sequences using its hierarchical
structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed TMN
in two practical problems, aircraft trajectory modelling and pedestrian
trajectory modelling in a surveillance setting, and in both cases we outperform
the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we perform an in depth analysis on
the evolution of the memory module content over time and provide visual
evidence on how the proposed TMN is able to map both long term and short term
relationships efficiently via a hierarchical structure.

its maintenance (or homeostasis) over time are still largely unknown. In this
paper, we investigate this question on adipose tissue. Adipose tissue can
represent 20 to 50% of the body weight. Its investigation is key to overcome a
large array of metabolic disorders that heavily strike populations worldwide.
Adipose tissue consists of lobular clusters of adipocytes surrounded by an
organized collagen fiber network. By supplying substrates needed for
adipogenesis, vasculature was believed to induce the regroupment of adipocytes
near capillary extremities. This paper shows that the emergence of these
structures could be explained by simple mechanical interactions between the
adipocytes and the collagen fibers. Our assumption is that the fiber network
resists the pressure induced by the growing adipocytes and forces them to
regroup into clusters. Reciprocally, cell clusters force the fibers to merge
into a well-organized network. We validate this hypothesis by means of a
two-dimensional Individual Based Model (IBM) of interacting adipocytes and
extra-cellular-matrix fiber elements. The model produces structures that
compare quantitatively well to the experimental observations. Our model seems
to indicate that cell clusters could spontaneously emerge as a result of simple
mechanical interactions between cells and fibers and surprisingly, vasculature
is not directly needed for these structures to emerge.

derive from a single one: violation of conservation of energy in the standard
paradigm. Standard cosmology satisfies conservation of local energy, however
disregards the inherent global aspect of energy. We therefore explore
conservation of the quasi-local Misner-Sharp energy within the causal horizon,
which, as we argue, is necessarily an apparent horizon. Misner-Sharp energy
assumes the presence of arbitrary mass-energy. Its conservation, however,
yields ""empty"" de Sitter (open, flat, closed) as single cosmological solution,
where Misner-Sharp total energy acts as cosmological constant and where the
source of curvature energy is unidentified. It is argued that de Sitter is only
apparently empty of matter. That is, total matter energy scales as curvature
energy in open de Sitter, which causes evolution of the cosmic potential and
induces gravitational time dilation. Curvature of time accounts completely for
the extrinsic curvature, i.e., renders open de Sitter spatially flat. This
explains the well known, surprising, spatial flatness of Misner-Sharp energy,
even if extrinsic curvature is non-zero. The general relativistic derivation
from Misner-Sharp energy is confirmed by a Machian equation of recessional and
peculiar energy, which explicitly assumes the presence of matter. This
relational model enhances interpretation. Time-dilated open de Sitter is
spatially flat, dynamically close to $\Lambda$CDM, and is shown to be without
the conceptual problems of concordance cosmology.

theory on a generic background, including the Weyl and super-Weyl anomalies.
Moreover, we show that these anomalies satisfy the Wess-Zumino consistency
condition. The super-Weyl anomaly implies that the fermionic operators of the
dual field theory, such as the supercurrent, do not transform as tensors under
rigid supersymmetry on backgrounds that admit a conformal Killing spinor, and
their anticommutator with the conserved supercharge contains anomalous terms.
This property is explicitly checked for a toy model. Finally, using the
anomalous transformation of the supercurrent, we obtain the anomaly-corrected
supersymmetry algebra on curved backgrounds admitting a conformal Killing
spinor.

energy in homoepitaxy. The PDE is motivated both by an atomistic broken-bond

the PDE, we demonstrate the lack of symmetry in the evolution of top and bottom
facets in periodic surface profiles. Our explicit, analytical solution is
