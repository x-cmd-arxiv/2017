theory in curved space-time and the propagation of perturbations in certain
condensed matter systems. But not every curved space-time can be simulated in
such a way, because one does not only need a condensed matter system that
generates the desired metric tensor, but that system then also has to obey its
own equations of motion. And specifying the metric tensor that one wishes to
realize usually overdetermines the underlying condensed matter system, such
that its equations of motion are in general not fulfilled, in which case the
desired metric does not have an analogue.
  Here, we show that the class of metrics that have an analogue is bigger than
what a first cursory consideration might suggest. This is due to the analogue
metric only being defined up to a choice of parametrization of the perturbation
in the underlying condensed matter system. In this way, the class of analogue
gravity models can be vastly expanded. In particular, we demonstrate how this
freedom of choice can be used to insert an intermediary conformal factor. Then,
as a corollary, we find that any metric conformal to a Painlev\'e--Gullstrand
type line element can, potentially, result as an analogue of a perturbation
propagating in a non-viscous, barotropic fluid.

each component of the metric tensor when visiting different entropic states of
the system. Simulations show that the geometric deformations induced by the

reversible for an increase of the same amount, provided there is significant
variation in the system entropy: the process of taking a system from a lower
entropy state A to a higher entropy state B and then bringing it back to A,
induces a natural intrinsic one-way direction of evolution. In this context,
Fisher curves resemble mathematical models of hysteresis in which the natural
orientation is pointed by an arrow of time.

obstacles with a total of $n$ vertices in the plane, we study the problem of
computing bicriteria rectilinear shortest paths between two points $s$ and $t$
in $\mathcal{P}$. Three types of bicriteria rectilinear paths are considered:
minimum-link shortest paths, shortest minimum-link paths, and minimum-cost
paths where the cost of a path is a non-decreasing function of both the number
of edges and the length of the path. The one-point and two-point path queries
are also considered. Algorithms for these problems have been given previously.
Our contributions are threefold. First, we find a critical error in all
previous algorithms. Second, we correct the error in a not-so-trivial way.
Third, we further improve the algorithms so that they are even faster than the
previous (incorrect) algorithms when $h$ is relatively small. For example, for
the minimum-link shortest paths, we obtain the following results. Our algorithm
computes a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path in $O(n+h\log^{3/2} h)$ time. For
the one-point queries, we build a data structure of size $O(n+ h\log h)$ in
$O(n+h\log^{3/2} h)$ time for a source point $s$, such that given any query
point $t$, a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path can be determined in $O(\log

preprocessing, a minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path can be determined in
$O(\log n+\log^2 h)$ time for any two query points $s$ and $t$; alternatively,
with $O(n+h^2\cdot \log^{2} h \cdot 4^{\sqrt{\log h}})$ time and $O(n+h^2\cdot

However, the combination of current data coming from oscillation experiments,
neutrinoless double beta decay searches, and cosmological surveys, can provide
interesting constraints for such unknowns in the sub-eV mass range, down to
O(0.1) eV in some cases. We discuss current limits on absolute neutrino mass
observables by performing a global data analysis, that includes the latest
results from oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay bounds
from the KamLAND-Zen experiment, and constraints from representative
combinations of Planck measurements and other cosmological data sets. In
general, NO appears to be somewhat favored with respect to IO at the level of
~2 sigma, mainly by neutrino oscillation data (especially atmospheric),
corroborated by cosmological data in some cases. Detailed constraints are
obtained via the chi^2 method, by expanding the parameter space either around
separate minima in NO and IO, or around the absolute minimum in any ordering.

resulting inhomogeneities in the accretion flow, play a significant role in the
fragmentation process. Filaments which experience a weakly turbulent accretion
flow fragment in a two-tier hierarchical fashion, similar to the fragmentation
pattern seen in the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. Increasing the energy in
the turbulent velocity field results in more sub-structure within the
filaments, and one sees a shift from gravity-dominated fragmentation to
turbulence-dominated fragmentation. The sub-structure formed in the filaments
is elongated and roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the filament,
similar to the fibres seen in observations of Taurus, and suggests that the
fray and fragment scenario is a possible mechanism for the production of
fibres. We show that the formation of these fibre-like structures is linked to
the vorticity of the velocity field inside the filament and the filament's
accretion from an inhomogeneous medium. Moreover, we find that accretion is
able to drive and sustain roughly sonic levels of turbulence inside the
filaments, but is not able to prevent radial collapse once the filaments become
supercritical. However, the supercritical filaments which contain fibre-like
structures do not collapse radially, suggesting that fibrous filaments may not
necessarily become radially unstable once they reach the critical line-density.

involving the study and design of detection techniques capable of efficiently
identifying ever-evolving spammers. Recently, a new wave of social spambots has
emerged, with advanced human-like characteristics that allow them to go
undetected even by current state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we show
that efficient spambots detection can be achieved via an in-depth analysis of
their collective behaviors exploiting the digital DNA technique for modeling
the behaviors of social network users. Inspired by its biological counterpart,
in the digital DNA representation the behavioral lifetime of a digital account
is encoded in a sequence of characters. Then, we define a similarity measure
for such digital DNA sequences. We build upon digital DNA and the similarity
between groups of users to characterize both genuine accounts and spambots.
Leveraging such characterization, we design the Social Fingerprinting
technique, which is able to discriminate among spambots and genuine accounts in
both a supervised and an unsupervised fashion. We finally evaluate the
effectiveness of Social Fingerprinting and we compare it with three
state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Among the peculiarities of our approach
is the possibility to apply off-the-shelf DNA analysis techniques to study
online users behaviors and to efficiently rely on a limited number of
lightweight account characteristics.

remarkable among ultracool dwarfs for being the most luminous radio emitter
over the widest frequency range. Masses and luminosities are at first sight
consistent with the system being coeval at age ~80 Myr according to standard

develop a model able to retrieve the intrinsic energy gap leading to a value
which is in rough agreement with other experiments, bridging the apparent
contradiction. At doping $x \approx 5 \%$ we further observe circular features
in the conductance layers that point to the emergence of a significant density

superconducting qubit in a circuit-QED architecture. Based on
measurement-induced dephasing, this technique allows the measurement of modes
that have a high quality factor (Q) and may be difficult to detect through
standard transmission and reflection measurements at the device ports. In this
scheme the qubit itself acts as a sensitive phase meter, revealing modes that
couple to it through measurements of its coherence time. Such modes are
indistinguishable from EM modes that do not couple to the qubit using a vector
network analyzer. Moreover, this technique provides useful characterization
parameters including the quality factor and the coupling strength of the
unwanted resonances. We demonstrate the method for detecting both high-Q
coupling resonators in planar devices as well as spurious modes produced by a
3D cavity.

Although extensively researched, from single cells to demographic scales, a

that such an expanding colony self-organizes into a ""mosaic"" of microdomains

by two competing forces: the steric forces between neighboring cells, which
favor cell alignment, and the extensile stresses due to cell growth that tend
to reduce the local orientational order and thereby distort the system. This
interplay results in an exponential distribution of the domain areas and sets a
characteristic length scale proportional to the square root of the ratio
between the system orientational stiffness and the magnitude of the extensile
active stress. Our theoretical predictions are finally compared with
experiments with freely growing E. coli microcolonies, finding quantitative
agreement.

grows in intensity upon reducing the field and overlaps with the one-magnon

find that the low and high field regions are smoothly connected with no sharp

fits to an extensive data set we re-evaluate the spin Hamiltonian finding

process controlling the evolution of galaxies. Understanding the star formation

challenge for theoretical models. Here we simulate a kiloparsec region of a
disk, following the evolution of self-gravitating molecular clouds down to
subparsec scales, as they form stars that then inject feedback energy by
dissociating and ionizing UV photons and supernova explosions. We assess the
relative importance of each feedback mechanism. We find that $\rm
H_2$-dissociating feedback results in the largest absolute reduction in star
formation compared to the run with no feedback. Subsequently adding
photoionization feedback produces a more modest reduction. Our fiducial models
that combine all three feedback mechanisms yield, without fine-tuning, star
formation rates that are in excellent agreement with observations, with $\rm
H_2$-dissociating photons playing a crucial role. Models that only include
supernova feedback---a common method in galaxy evolution simulations---settle
to similar star formation rates, but with very different temperature and
chemical states of the gas, and with very different spatial distributions of
young stars.

performed with the Swift/XRT telescope in the soft X-ray band (0.5-10 keV)

expected transition to the propeller regime was not observed. However, the
transitions between different regimes of accretion were detected. In
particular, after an outburst the source entered a stable accretion state
characterised by the accretion rate of ~10^14-10^15 g/s. We associate this
state with accretion from a cold (low-ionised) disc of temperature below ~6500

H$\alpha$-EW distribution is much broader (10--500 \AA) than can easily be
explained by a simple monotonic SFH with a standard Salpeter-slope IMF. Though
this discrepancy is somewhat alleviated when it is assumed that there is no
relative attenuation difference between stars and nebular lines, the result is
robust against observational biases, and no single IMF (i.e. non-Salpeter
slope) can reproduce the data. We show using both spectral stacking and Monte
Carlo simulations that starbursts cannot explain the EW distribution. We
investigate other physical mechanisms including models with variations in
stellar rotation, binary star evolution, metallicity, and the IMF upper-mass
cutoff. IMF variations and/or highly rotating extreme metal poor stars
(Z~0.1Z$_\odot$) with binary interactions are the most plausible explanations
for our data. If the IMF varies, then the highest H$\alpha$-EWs would require
very shallow slopes ($\Gamma$>-1.0) with no one slope able to reproduce the
data. Thus, the IMF would have to vary stochastically. We conclude that the
stellar populations at z~2 show distinct differences from local populations and
there is no simple physical model to explain the large variation in
H$\alpha$-EWs at z~2.

for the first time a hybridization of interface states across layers. In this
way, our heterostructure forms an emergent atomic chain, where the interfaces
act as lattice sites and the interface states act as atomic orbitals, as seen
from our measurements by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By
changing the composition of the heterostructure, we can directly control
hopping between lattice sites. We realize a topological and a trivial phase in
our superlattice band structure. We argue that the superlattice may be
characterized in a significant way by a one-dimensional topological invariant,
closely related to the invariant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our
topological insulator heterostructure demonstrates a novel experimental

the revised SFH also scales up the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), as determined from the observed volumetric SN Ia rate
history, aligning it with other field-galaxy SN Ia DTD measurements. The

Hubble-time-integrated production efficiency of $N/M_\star=1.3\pm0.1$ SNe Ia
per $1000~{\rm M_\odot}$ of formed stellar mass. Using these revised histories
and updated empirical iron yields of the various SN types, we re-derive the

about equally to the total mass of iron in the Universe today. We find the
track of the average cosmic gas element in the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
abundance-ratio plane. The track is broadly similar to the observed main locus
of Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky Way (MW) SFH similar in
form to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple MW SFH that makes the track
closely match this stellar locus. Galaxy clusters appear to have a
higher-normalization DTD. This cluster DTD, combined with a short-burst MW SFH
peaked at $z=3$, produces a track that matches remarkably well the observed
""high-$\alpha$"" locus of MW stars, suggesting the halo/thick-disk population
has had a galaxy-cluster-like formation mode. Thus, a simple two-component SFH,

coincides with sSFR/sMAR$\sim1$, where sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion
rate. (2) $M_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams
being more efficient at high redshift while virial shocks and AGN feedback
become more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak
value, which occurs around $M_{\rm vir}\sim2\times10^{11}M_{\odot}$. (4) The
stellar mass density within 1 kpc, $\Sigma_1$, is a good indicator of the
galactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach
a maximum in $\Sigma_1$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas
compaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation
is responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower-mass
galaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside out. The marked change in the slope of the
size--mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from $d\log R_{\rm

star is consistent with a primordial disc and is well-fit using a
two-temperature blackbody model with $T_{\rm inner}\simeq$ 1100 K and $T_{\rm

significant variability in the 3.4 $\mu$m and 4.6 $\mu$m bands. We calculate an

  reduction","Accepted to the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing",,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a space-time least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (ST-LSPG)
projection method for model reduction of nonlinear dynamical systems. In
contrast to typical nonlinear model-reduction methods that first apply
(Petrov-)Galerkin projection in the spatial dimension and subsequently apply
time integration to numerically resolve the resulting low-dimensional dynamical
system, the proposed method applies projection in space and time
simultaneously. To accomplish this, the method first introduces a
low-dimensional space-time trial subspace, which can be obtained by computing
tensor decompositions of state-snapshot data. The method then computes
discrete-optimal approximations in this space-time trial subspace by minimizing
the residual arising after time discretization over all space and time in a
weighted $\ell^2$-norm. This norm can be defined to enable complexity reduction
(i.e., hyper-reduction) in time, which leads to space-time collocation and
space-time GNAT variants of the ST-LSPG method. Advantages of the approach
relative to typical spatial-projection-based nonlinear model reduction methods
such as Galerkin projection and least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection
include: (1) a reduction of both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the
dynamical system, (2) the removal of spurious temporal modes (e.g., unstable
growth) from the state space, and (3) error bounds that exhibit slower growth
in time. Numerical examples performed on model problems in fluid dynamics
demonstrate the ability of the method to generate orders-of-magnitude
computational savings relative to spatial-projection-based reduced-order models
without sacrificing accuracy.

because it is not related to behaviors or natural phenomena. DSO has two core
parts: the semi-autonomous drones that fly over a landscape to explore, and the
Command Center that processes the retrieved data and updates the drones'
firmware whenever necessary. The self-adaptive aspect of DSO in this work is
the perturbation/movement scheme, which is the procedure used to generate
target coordinates. This procedure is evolved by the Command Center during the
global optimization process in order to adapt DSO to the search landscape. DSO
was evaluated on a set of widely employed benchmark functions. The statistical

quasars (i.e. $L_{\rm X}\propto L_{\rm UV}^{\gamma}$), with a dispersion of

modified version of this relation which involves the broad emission lines'
full-width at half maximum, $L_{\rm X}\propto L_{\rm

relation through a simple, {\it ad-hoc} model of accretion disc corona, derived
from previous works where it is assumed that reconnection and magnetic loops
above the accretion disc can account for the production of the primary X-ray
radiation. We find that the monochromatic optical-UV (2500 \AA) and X-ray (2

with the slopes and the normalization obtained from a fit of a sample of 545
optically selected quasars from SDSS DR7 cross matched with the latest
XMM-Newton catalogue 3XMM-DR6. The homogeneous sample used here has a
dispersion of 0.21 dex, which is much lower than previous works in the
literature and suggests a tight physical relation between the accretion disc

time, and thus it can be employed as a cosmological indicator to robustly
estimate cosmological parameters.

models. This technique can overcome the limitations imposed by tissue
scattering in optically determining the in vivo location of fibre-optic medical
instruments.

regression problem. Model Tree (MT) is one of the Machine Learning based
regression techniques that is useful for software effort estimation, but as
other machine learning algorithms, the MT has a large space of configuration
and requires to carefully setting its parameters. The choice of such parameters
is a dataset dependent so no general guideline can govern this process which
forms the motivation of this work. Aims: This study investigates the effect of
using the most recent optimization algorithm called Bees algorithm to specify
the optimal choice of MT parameters that fit a dataset and therefore improve
prediction accuracy. Method: We used MT with optimal parameters identified by
the Bees algorithm to construct software effort estimation model. The model has
been validated over eight datasets come from two main sources: PROMISE and
ISBSG. Also we used 3-Fold cross validation to empirically assess the
prediction accuracies of different estimation models. As benchmark, results are
also compared to those obtained with Stepwise Regression Case-Based Reasoning
and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Results: The results obtained from combination of
MT and Bees algorithm are encouraging and outperforms other well-known
estimation methods applied on employed datasets. They are also interesting
enough to suggest the effectiveness of MT among the techniques that are
suitable for effort estimation. Conclusions: The use of the Bees algorithm
enabled us to automatically find optimal MT parameters required to construct
effort estimation models that fit each individual dataset. Also it provided a
significant improvement on prediction accuracy.

scattering within a dispersive approach, including contributions from both
Nucleon and Delta intermediate states. The dispersive analysis avoids off-shell
uncertainties inherent in traditional approaches based on direct evaluation of
loop diagrams, and guarantees the correct unitary behavior in the high energy
limit. Using empirical information on the electromagnetic nucleon elastic and
N-Delta transition form factors, we compute the two-photon exchange corrections
both algebraically and numerically. Results are compared with recent
measurements of e+p to e-p cross section ratios from the CLAS, VEPP-3 and
OLYMPUS experiments, as well as with polarization transfer observables.

depends on a parameter ${\lambda}_x$ and the estimation of the number of twin

distribution of twin primes. Combining the latter with an asymptotic bound of
${\lambda}_x$, establishes venues, conducive to a discovery of a partial result
that can be considered as a suitable variant of the prime number theorem.
Furthermore, we obtain an asymptotic bound of the number of twin primes less
