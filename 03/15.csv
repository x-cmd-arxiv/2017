the settling process, the silt particles show behaviors that are different from
non-cohesive particles due to the influence of inter-particle cohesive force.
While it is a consensus that cohesive behaviors depend on the characteristics
of sediment particles (e.g., Bond number, particle size distribution), little
is known about the exact influence of these characteristics on the cohesive
behaviors. In the present work, three-dimensional settling process is
investigated numerically by using CFD--DEM (Computational Fluid
Dynamics--Discrete Element Method). The inter-particle collision force, the van
der Waals force, and the fluid--particle interaction forces are considered. The
numerical model is used to simulate the hindered settling process of silt based
on the experimental setup in the literature. The results obtained in the
simulations, including the structural densities of the beds, the characteristic
lines, and the particle terminal velocity, are in good agreement with the
experimental observations in the literature. To the authors' knowledge, this is
the first time that the influences of non-dimensional Bond number and particle
polydispersity on the structural densities of silt beds have been investigated
separately. The results demonstrate that the cohesive behavior of silt in the
settling process is attributed to both the cohesion among silt particles
themselves and the particle polydispersity. To guide to the macro-scale
modeling of cohesive silt sedimentation, the collision frequency functions
obtained in the numerical simulations are also presented based on the
micromechanics of particles. The results obtained by using CFD--DEM indicate
that the binary collision theory over-estimated the particle collision
frequency in the flocculation process at high solid volume fraction.

with a standard {\Gamma}~1.7 and an iron emission line, with no need for any
further component up to ~40 keV. These spectral properties, together with
significant variability on time-scales as short as weeks (as shown in a 2014
Swift monitoring campaign), strongly support an unobscured line-of-sight for
this source. An alternative scenario in terms of a Compton-thick source is
strongly disfavoured, requiring an exceptional geometrical configuration,
whereas a large fraction of the solid angle to the source is filled by a highly
ionised gas, whose reprocessed emission would dominate the observed luminosity.
Moreover, in this scenario the implied intrinsic X-ray luminosity of the source
would be much larger than the value predicted by other luminosity proxies, like
the [OIII]{\lambda}5007 emission line extinction-corrected luminosity.

MPs. We use J-band integrated spectra of three young (7-40 Myr) clusters in NGC

Galactic clusters with comparable mass; we find that none of the studied
clusters show significant Al variations. Small Al spreads have been measured in
all the six young clusters observed in the near-infrared. While it is unlikely
that young clusters only show low Al whereas old ones display different levels
of Al variations; this suggests the possibility that MPs are not present at
such young ages at least among the high-mass stellar component. Alternatively,
the fraction of stars with field-like chemistry could be extremely large,
mimicking low Al abundances in the integrated spectrum. Finally, since the
near-infrared stellar continuum of young clusters is almost entirely due to
luminous red supergiants, we can also speculate that MPs only manifest

a simple picture: Interaction requires an exchange of energy. In the quantum

concept so-called self-concordance introduced by Nesterov and Nemirovskii in
the early 1990s to a broader class of convex functions, which we call
generalized self-concordant functions. This notion allows us to develop a
unified framework for designing Newton-type methods to solve convex optimiza-
tion problems. The proposed theory provides a mathematical tool to analyze both
local and global convergence of Newton-type methods without imposing
unverifiable assumptions as long as the un- derlying functionals fall into our
generalized self-concordant function class. First, we introduce the class of
generalized self-concordant functions, which covers standard self-concordant
functions as a special case. Next, we establish several properties and key
estimates of this function class, which can be used to design numerical
methods. Then, we apply this theory to develop several Newton-type methods for
solving a class of smooth convex optimization problems involving the
generalized self- concordant functions. We provide an explicit step-size for
the damped-step Newton-type scheme which can guarantee a global convergence
without performing any globalization strategy. We also prove a local quadratic
convergence of this method and its full-step variant without requiring the
Lipschitz continuity of the objective Hessian. Then, we extend our result to
develop proximal Newton-type methods for a class of composite convex
minimization problems involving generalized self-concordant functions. We also
achieve both global and local convergence without additional assumption.
Finally, we verify our theoretical results via several numerical examples, and
compare them with existing methods.

This produces secondary electrons which transport this energy radially away
from the ion path. The ranges of most of these electrons do not exceed a few
nanometres, therefore large energy densities (radial doses) are produced within
a narrow region around the ion trajectory. Large energy density gradients
correspond to large pressure gradients and this brings about shock waves
propagating away from the ion path. Previous works have studied these waves by
molecular dynamics simulations investigating their damaging effects on DNA
molecules. However, these simulations where performed assuming that all energy
lost by ions is deposited uniformly in thin cylinders around their path. In the
present work the radial dose distributions, calculated by solving the diffusion
equation for the low energy electrons and complemented with a semi-empirical
inclusion of more energetic $\delta$-electrons, are used to set up initial
conditions for the shock wave simulation. The effect of these energy
distributions vs. stepwise energy distributions in tracks on the strength of
shock waves induced by carbon ions both in the Bragg peak region and out of it

computationally simple on paper (robustness has been shown to be
PSPACE-complete for TSO, PGAS, and Power), building a practical robustness
checker remains a challenge. The problem is that the various relaxations lead
to a dramatic number of computations, only few of which violate robustness.
  In the present paper, we set out to reduce the search space for robustness
checkers. We focus on store-atomic consistency models and establish two
completeness results. The first result, called locality, states that a
non-robust program always contains a violating computation where only one
thread delays commands. The second result, called singularity, is even stronger
but restricted to programs without lightweight fences. It states that there is
a violating computation where a single store is delayed.
  As an application of the results, we derive a linear-size source-to-source
translation of robustness to SC-reachability. It applies to general programs,
regardless of the data domain and potentially with an unbounded number of

anisotropic magnetothermal conductivity, strongly dependent on externally
applied magnetic field and resulting from entropy transport driven by
circulating electronic currents. The circulating currents result in no net

translates into a magnetothermal conductivity that should be a unique

the Fermi arc-mediated magnetothermal conductivity in the low-field

changes. The evidence presented herein corroborates that single cells deform
during an action potential (AP). It is demonstrated that excitation of plant
cells (Chara braunii internodes) is accompanied by out-of-plane displacements
of the cell surface in the micrometer range (1-10 micron). The onset of
cellular deformation coincides with the depolarization phase of the AP. The
mechanical pulse (i) propagates with the same velocity as the electrical pulse
(within experimental accuracy; 10 mm/s), (ii) is reversible, (iii) in most
cases of biphasic nature (109 out of 152 experiments) and (iv) presumably
independent of actin-myosin-motility. The existence of transient mechanical
changes in the cell cortex is confirmed by micropipette aspiration experiments.
A theoretical analysis demonstrates that this observation can be explained by a
reversible change in the mechanical properties of the cell surface
(transmembrane pressure, surface tension and bending rigidity). Taken together,
these findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the physical nature of
cellular excitability.

resolved. It is shown that an additional contribution to the maximum

the additional contribution is an artifact of a work storage system

surface reconstruction in the pseudogap phase, namely, a sign change of the
Hall coefficient to negative values at low temperatures at intermediate range
of hole doping and a rapid suppression of the positive Hall number without
change in sign near optimal doping $p \sim 0.19$. We show that the assumption
of a unidirectional incommensurate CDW (with or without a coexisting weak
bidirectional order) at high magnetic fields near optimal doping and a
coexistence of both types of orders of approximately equal magnitude at high

simulate the ability of frozen planets to escape from glaciation by
accumulating enough gaseous CO$_2$. We find that Earth-like planets orbiting a
Sun-like star may never be able to escape from glaciation if their orbital
distance is greater than $\sim$ 1.27 AU (Flux $<$ 847 W m$^{-2}$ or 62$\%$ of
the Solar constant), because CO$_2$ would condense at the poles forming
permanent CO$_2$ ice caps. This limits the amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere
and thus its greenhouse effect. The amount of CO$_2$ that can be trapped in the
polar caps depends on the efficiency of CO$_2$ ice to flow laterally as well as
its graviational stability relative to subsurface water ice. The flow of CO$_2$
ice from poles to equator is mostly controlled by the bottom temperature, and
hence by the internal heat flux. We find that a frozen Earth-like planet
located at 1.30 AU of a Sun-like star could store as much as 1.5/4.5/15 bars of
dry ice at the poles, for internal heat fluxes of 100/30/10 mW m$^{-2}$. But
these amounts are lower limits. For planets with a significant water ice cover,
we show that CO$_2$ ice deposits should be gravitationnally unstable. They get
buried beneath the water ice cover in geologically short timescales of
$\sim$~10$^4$ yrs, mainly controlled by the viscosity of water ice. CO$_2$
would be permanently sequestered underneath the water ice cover, in the form of
CO$_2$ liquids, CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates and/or dissolved in subglacial water
reservoirs (if any). This would considerably increase the amount of CO$_2$

differently to changes into the core physical conditions, but they are more

variations in the core density. Gas-phase models highlighted the importance of
surface reactions as factories of large molecules and showed that for sulphur
bearing species depletion is important to reproduce observations.
  Comparing the results of the reference model with the most recent millimeter

reproducing the observed abundances of most of the species during early stages

rates (5 - 10) $\times \zeta_{\text {ISM}}$ are often overestimating the

from Galactic GCs and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies by Marks et al. Our results
signify that the combination of the density- and metallicity-dependent
top-heavy IMF, the anti-correlation between age and metallicity, stellar
evolution and standard dynamical evolution yields the best possible agreement
with the observed trend of $M/L-\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ for M31 GCs.

  and Localization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new algorithm for the reliable detection and localization of
video copy-move forgeries. Discovering well crafted video copy-moves may be
very difficult, especially when some uniform background is copied to occlude
foreground objects. To reliably detect both additive and occlusive copy-moves
we use a dense-field approach, with invariant features that guarantee
robustness to several post-processing operations. To limit complexity, a
suitable video-oriented version of PatchMatch is used, with a multiresolution
search strategy, and a focus on volumes of interest. Performance assessment
relies on a new dataset, designed ad hoc, with realistic copy-moves and a wide
variety of challenging situations. Experimental results show the proposed
method to detect and localize video copy-moves with good accuracy even in
adverse conditions.

M\'enard (2013) to study the clustering of MgII absorbers around massive
galaxies (~10^11.5 M_sun), quasars and radio-loud AGN with redshifts between
0.4 and 0.75. Clustering is evaluated in two dimensions, by binning absorbers
both in projected radius and in velocity separation. Excess MgII is detected
around massive galaxies out to R_p=20 Mpc. At projected radii less than 800
kpc, the excess extends out to velocity separations of 10,000 km/s. The extent
of the high velocity tail within this radius is independent of the mean stellar
age of the galaxy and whether or not it harbours an active galactic nucleus. We
interpret our results using the publicly available Illustris and Millennium
simulations. Models where the MgII absorbers trace the dark matter particle or
subhalo distributions do not fit the data. They overpredict the clustering on
small scales and do not reproduce the excess high velocity separation MgII
absorbers seen within the virial radius of the halo. The Illustris simulations
which include thermal, but not mechanical feedback from AGN, also do not
provide an adequate fit to the properties of the cool halo gas within the
virial radius. We propose that the large velocity separation MgII absorbers
trace gas that has been pushed out of the dark matter halos, possibly by
multiple episodes of AGN-driven mechanical feedback acting over long
timescales.

very useful for convex optimization problems, but can exhibit undesirable
oscillations yielding slow convergence rates for some applications. An adaptive
restarting scheme can improve the convergence rate of the fast gradient method,
when the parameter of a strongly convex cost function is unknown or when the
iterates of the algorithm enter a locally strongly convex region. Recently, we
introduced the optimized gradient method, a first-order algorithm that has an
inexpensive per-iteration computational cost similar to that of the fast
gradient method, yet has a worst-case cost function rate that is twice faster
than that of the fast gradient method and that is optimal for large-dimensional
smooth convex problems. Building upon the success of accelerating the fast
gradient method using adaptive restart, this paper investigates similar
heuristic acceleration of the optimized gradient method. We first derive a new
first-order method that resembles the optimized gradient method for strongly
convex quadratic problems with known function parameters, yielding a linear
convergence rate that is faster than that of the analogous version of the fast
gradient method. We then provide a heuristic analysis and numerical experiments
that illustrate that adaptive restart can accelerate the convergence of the
optimized gradient method. Numerical results also illustrate that adaptive
restart is helpful for a proximal version of the optimized gradient method for
nonsmooth composite convex functions.

use a deterministic rolling horizon procedure, which has been modified to
handle uncertainty (e.g. buffer stocks, schedule slack). This approach has been
criticized for its use of a deterministic approximation of a stochastic
problem, which is the major motivation for stochastic programming. We recast
this debate by identifying both deterministic and stochastic approaches as
policies for solving a stochastic base model, which may be a simulator or the
real world. Stochastic lookahead models (stochastic programming) require a
range of approximations to keep the problem tractable. By contrast, so-called
deterministic models are actually parametrically modified cost function
approximations which use parametric adjustments to the objective function
and/or the constraints. These parameters are then optimized in a stochastic
base model which does not require making any of the types of simplifications
required by stochastic programming. We formalize this strategy and describe a

Mott phase. The significant reduction of the Neel temperature from 150 K for

the former is boosted by a substantial interlayer exchange coupling. Resonant
x-ray magnetic scattering revealed that the interlayer exchange coupling has a
switchable sign, depending on the SrTiO$_3$ layer number $m$, for maintaining
canting-induced weak ferromagnetism. The nearly unaltered transition

realized a two-dimensional antiferromagnet at finite temperatures with

witnessed the emergence of opto-electronic network on-chip designs based on
nanophotonics, in order to achieve higher network throughput, lower latencies,
and lower dynamic power. However, traditional nanophotonics options face
limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher
static power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on
achievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an
emerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains
on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter
interaction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC
that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical
interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various
opto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with
HyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by
conventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space
exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a
performance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8x. To further validate our
estimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark
suite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x, with negligible
energy increase. We then further carry out performance and cost projections for
fully optical NoCs, using HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics. These
futuristic projections indicate that all-HyPPI NoCs would be two orders more
energy efficient than electronics, and two orders more area efficient than
all-photonic NoCs.

we investigate the causes of after-pulsing by testing pre-2013 and post-2013
devices using laser light ranging from 405 to 820nm. Doing so we investigate
the possibility that afterpulsing is also due to optical photons produced in
the avalanche rather than to impurities trapping charged carriers produced in
the avalanches and releasing them at a later time. For pre-2013 devices, we
observe avalanches delayed by ns to several 100~ns at 637, 777nm and 820 nm
demonstrating that holes created in the zero field region of the silicon bulk
can diffuse back to the high field region triggering delayed avalanches. On the
other hand post-2013 exhibit no delayed avalanches beyond 100~ns at 777nm. We
also confirm that post-2013 devices exhibit about 25 times lower after-pulsing.
Taken together, our measurements show that the absorption of photons from the
avalanche in the bulk of the silicon and the subsequent hole diffusion back to
the junction was a significant source of after-pulse for the pre-2013 devices.
Hamamatsu appears to have fixed this problem in 2013 following the preliminary
release of our results. We also show that even at short wavelength the timing
distribution exhibit tails in the sub-nanosecond range that may impair the MPPC
timing performances.

acquisition time while simultaneously reducing radiation damage to samples.
However, for a sparse sampling scheme to be useful it is important that we are
able to reconstruct the underlying object with sufficient clarity using the
sparse measurements. In dynamic sampling, each new measurement location is
selected based on information obtained from previous measurements. Therefore,
dynamic sampling schemes have the potential to dramatically reduce the number
of measurements needed for high fidelity reconstructions. However, most
existing dynamic sampling methods for point-wise measurement acquisition tend
to be computationally expensive and are therefore too slow for practical
applications.
  In this paper, we present a framework for dynamic sampling based on machine
learning techniques, which we call a supervised learning approach for dynamic
sampling (SLADS). In each step of SLADS, the objective is to find the pixel
that maximizes the expected reduction in distortion (ERD) given previous
measurements. SLADS is fast because we use a simple regression function to
compute the ERD, and it is accurate because the regression function is trained
using data sets that are representative of the specific application. In
addition, we introduce a method to terminate dynamic sampling at a desired
level of distortion, and we extended the SLADS methodology to sample groups of
pixels at each step. Finally, we present results on computationally-generated
synthetic data and experimentally-collected data to demonstrate a dramatic
improvement over state-of-the-art static sampling methods.

Unfortunately, the variance of the current densification techniques is
unnecessarily high, which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to
vanilla minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this paper, we
provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored
2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and

objects in a point cloud representation of the scene. These clusters are
subsequently used to compute a bounding box around each object in the RGB
space. Each defined patch is then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for object recognition. We also demonstrate that our region proposal method can
be used to develop novel datasets that are both large and diverse enough to
train deep learning models, and easy enough to collect that end-users can
develop their own datasets. Lastly, we validate the resulting system through an
extensive analysis of the accuracy and run-time of the full pipeline.

as follows: i) the current star formation in Haro 14 is spatially extended with
the major HII regions placed along a linear structure, elongated in the
north-south direction, and in a horseshoe-like curvilinear feature that extends
about 760 pc eastward; the continuum emission is more concentrated and peaks
close to the galaxy center; ii) two different episodes of star formation are
present: the recent starburst, with ages $\leq$ 6 Myrs and the intermediate-age
clusters, with ages between 10 and 30 Myrs; these stellar components rest on a
several Gyr old underlying host galaxy; iii) the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ pattern is
inhomogeneous, with excess color values varying from E(B-V)=0.04 up to
E(B-V)=1.09; iv) shocks play a significant role in the galaxy; and v) the
velocity field displays a complicated pattern with regions of material moving
toward us in the east and north galaxy areas. The morphology of Haro 14, its
irregular velocity field, and the presence of shocks speak in favor of a
scenario of triggered star formation. Ages of the knots are consistent with the

natural solution to simultaneously accommodate over a common network

key aspects that enable the realization of so-called network slices. Then, we
give a brief overview on the SDN architecture proposed by the ONF and show that
it provides tools to support slicing. We argue that although such architecture
paves the way for network slicing implementation, it lacks some essential
capabilities that can be supplied by NFV. Hence, we analyze a proposal from the

Additionally, we present an example scenario that combines SDN and NFV
technologies to address the realization of network slices. Finally, we
summarize the open research issues with the purpose of motivating new advances

model is used to implement these three proposals. Slowed processing is
implemented as slowed default production-rule firing time; intermittent
deficiency as increased random noise in activation of chunks in memory; and
resource reduction as reduced goal activation. As data, we considered subject
vs. object rela- tives whose matrix clause contained either an NP or a
reflexive, presented in a self-paced listening modality to 56 individuals with
aphasia (IWA) and 46 matched controls. The participants heard the sentences and
carried out a picture verification task to decide on an interpretation of the
sentence. These response accuracies are used to identify the best parameters
(for each participant) that correspond to the three hypotheses mentioned above.
We show that controls have more tightly clustered (less variable) parameter
values than IWA; specifically, compared to controls, among IWA there are more
individuals with low goal activations, high noise, and slow default action
times. This suggests that (i) individual patients show differential amounts of
deficit along the three dimensions of slowed processing, intermittent
deficient, and resource reduction, (ii) overall, there is evidence for all
three sources of deficit playing a role, and (iii) IWA have a more variable
range of parameter values than controls. In sum, this study contributes a proof
of concept of a quantitative implementation of, and evidence for, these three
accounts of comprehension deficits in aphasia.

the action of the Koopman operator on an $N$-dimensional subspace of the space
of observables by sampling at $M$ points in the state space. Assuming that the
samples are drawn either independently or ergodically from some measure $\mu$,
it was shown that, in the limit as $M\rightarrow\infty$, the EDMD operator
$\mathcal{K}_{N,M}$ converges to $\mathcal{K}_N$, where $\mathcal{K}_N$ is the
$L_2(\mu)$-orthogonal projection of the action of the Koopman operator on the
finite-dimensional subspace of observables. In this work, we show that, as $N
\rightarrow \infty$, the operator $\mathcal{K}_N$ converges in the strong
operator topology to the Koopman operator. This in particular implies
convergence of the predictions of future values of a given observable over any
finite time horizon, a fact important for practical applications such as
forecasting, estimation and control. In addition, we show that accumulation
points of the spectra of $\mathcal{K}_N$ correspond to the eigenvalues of the
Koopman operator with the associated eigenfunctions converging weakly to an
eigenfunction of the Koopman operator, provided that the weak limit of
eigenfunctions is nonzero. As a by-product, we propose an analytic version of
the EDMD algorithm which, under some assumptions, allows one to construct
$\mathcal{K}_N$ directly, without the use of sampling. Finally, under
additional assumptions, we analyze convergence of $\mathcal{K}_{N,N}$ (i.e.,
$M=N$), proving convergence, along a subsequence, to weak eigenfunctions (or
eigendistributions) related to the eigenmeasures of the Perron-Frobenius
operator. No assumptions on the observables belonging to a finite-dimensional
invariant subspace of the Koopman operator are required throughout.

the observed flux power spectrum from two different data sets: the XQ-100 and
HIRES/MIKE quasar spectra samples. After marginalization over nuisance and
physical parameters and with conservative assumptions for the thermal history
of the IGM that allow for jumps in the temperature of up to $5000\rm\,K$,
XQ-100 provides a lower limit of 7.1$\times 10^{-22}$ eV, HIRES/MIKE returns a
stronger limit of 14.3$\times 10^{-22}$ eV, while the combination of both data
sets results in a limit of 20 $\times 10^{-22}$ eV (2$\sigma$ C.L.). The limits
for the analysis of the combined data sets increases to 37.5$\times 10^{-22}$
eV (2$\sigma$ C.L.) when a smoother thermal history is assumed where the
temperature of the IGM evolves as a power-law in redshift. Light boson masses
in the range $1-10 \times10^{-22}$ eV are ruled out at high significance by our
analysis, casting strong doubts that FDM helps solve the ""small scale crisis""
of the cold dark matter models.

cusp-shaped increase of rate, similar to that which we partially observed in
2013, and a bright flare. These events are separated in time by about 104 ks,
which likely corresponds to the rotational period of the star (1.2 days). Time
resolved spectroscopy of the X-ray spectra shows that the first event is caused
by an increase of the plasma emission measure, while the second increase of
rate is a major flare with temperatures in excess of 60 MK ($kT\sim5$ keV).
From the analysis of its rise, we infer a magnetic field of $\ge300$ G and a
size of the flaring region of $\sim1.4-1.9\times10^{11}$ cm, which corresponds
to $\sim25\%-30\%$ of the stellar radius. We speculate that either an intrinsic
magnetism that produces a hot spot on its surface or an unknown low mass
companion are the source of such X-rays and variability. A hot spot of magnetic
origin should be a stable structure over a time span of $\ge$2.5 years, and
suggests an overall large scale dipolar magnetic field that produces an
extended feature on the stellar surface. In the second scenario, a low mass
unknown companion is the emitter of X-rays and it should orbit extremely close
to the surface of the primary in a locked spin-orbit configuration, almost on
the verge of collapsing onto the primary. As such, the X-ray activity of the
secondary star would be enhanced by its young age, and the tight orbit as in RS
Cvn systems and $\rho$ Ophiuchi would constitute an extreme system that is
worthy of further investigation.

naturally turbulent. The plasma in these environments is often so hot that
synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) radiative cooling becomes important. In
this paper we investigate the general thermodynamic and radiative properties
(and hence the observational appearance) of an optically thin relativistically
hot plasma stirred by driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and cooled by
radiation. We find that if the system reaches a statistical equilibrium where
turbulent heating is balanced by radiative cooling, the effective electron
temperature tends to attain a universal value $\theta = kT_e/m_e c^2 \sim
1/\sqrt{\tau_T}$, where $\tau_T=n_e\sigma_T L \ll 1$ is the system's Thomson
optical depth, essentially independent of the strength of turbulent driving or
magnetic field. This is because both MHD turbulent dissipation and synchrotron
cooling are proportional to the magnetic energy density. We also find that
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling and perhaps a few higher-order IC
components are automatically comparable to synchrotron in this regime. The
overall broadband radiation spectrum then consists of several distinct
components (synchrotron, SSC, etc.), well separated in photon energy (by a
factor $\sim \tau_T^{-1}$) and roughly equal in power. The number of IC peaks
is checked by Klein-Nishina effects and depends logarithmically on $\tau_T$ and
the magnetic field. We also examine the limitations due to synchrotron
self-absorption, explore applications to Crab PWN and blazar jets, and discuss
links to radiative magnetic reconnection.

global structure of the phase space of binary systems in the solar
neighbourhood using the Galactic potential. Aims. The aim of this work is to
obtain a simple model to study the collisionless dynamical evolution of generic
wide binaries systems in the solar neighbourhood. Methods. Through an averaging
process, we reduced the three-dimensional potential of the Galaxy to a secular
one-degree of freedom model. The accuracy of this model was tested by comparing
its predictions with numerical simulations of the exact equations of motion of
a two-body problem disturbed by the Galaxy. Results. Using the one-degree of
freedom model, we developed a detailed dynamical study, finding that the
secular Galactic tide period changes as a function of the separation of the
pair, which also gives a dynamical explanation for the arbitrary classification
between ""wide"" and ""tight"" binaries. Moreover, the secular phase space for a
generic gravitationally bound pair is similar to the dynamical structure of a
Lidov-Kozai resonance, but surprisingly this structure is independent of the
masses and semimajor axis of the binary system. Thus, the Galactic potential is
able to excite the initially circular orbit of binary systems to high values of
eccentricity, which has important implications for studies of binary star
systems (with and without exoplanets), comets, and Oort cloud objects.

address this by dividing players into similar skill levels and segmenting each

strongly correlated with a lower quitting rate when the score drops, and only
weakly correlated with skill, in line with psychological findings about the

associated with a set of labels, has generated a tremendous amount of attention
over recent years. The modern multi-label problems are typically large-scale in
terms of number of observations, features and labels, and the amount of labels
can even be comparable with the amount of observations. In this context,
different remedies have been proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality.
In this work, we aim at exploiting the output sparsity by introducing a new
loss, called the sparse weighted Hamming loss. This proposed loss can be seen
as a weighted version of classical ones, where active and inactive labels are
weighted separately. Leveraging the influence of sparsity in the loss function,
we provide improved generalization bounds for the empirical risk minimizer, a
suitable property for large-scale problems. For this new loss, we derive rates
of convergence linear in the underlying output-sparsity rather than linear in
the number of labels. In practice, minimizing the associated risk can be
performed efficiently by using convex surrogates and modern convex optimization
algorithms. We provide experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrating
the pertinence of our approach when compared to non-weighted techniques.

material recognition and segmentation. Enabling robots to recognise different
materials (concrete, metal etc.) in a scene is important for many tasks, e.g.
robotic interventions in nuclear decommissioning. Previous work on 3D semantic
reconstruction has predominantly focused on recognition of everyday domestic
objects (tables, chairs etc.), whereas previous work on material recognition
has largely been confined to single 2D images without any 3D reconstruction.
Meanwhile, most 3D semantic reconstruction methods rely on computationally
expensive post-processing, using Fully-Connected Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs), to achieve consistent segmentations. In contrast, we propose a deep
learning method which performs 3D reconstruction while simultaneously
recognising different types of materials and labelling them at the pixel level.
Unlike previous methods, we propose a fully end-to-end approach, which does not
require hand-crafted features or CRF post-processing. Instead, we use only
learned features, and the CRF segmentation constraints are incorporated inside
the fully end-to-end learned system. We present the results of experiments, in
which we trained our system to perform real-time 3D semantic reconstruction for
23 different materials in a real-world application. The run-time performance of
the system can be boosted to around 10Hz, using a conventional GPU, which is
enough to achieve real-time semantic reconstruction using a 30fps RGB-D camera.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first real-time end-to-end
system for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and material recognition.

adding bulk Berry monopoles with linearly dispersing electronic states and
topologically robust, gapless surface Fermi arcs terminating on bulk node
projections. Here, we show how the Nernst effect, combining entropy with charge
transport, gives a unique signature for the presence of Dirac bands. The Nernst
thermopower of NbP (maximum of 800 microV K-1 at 9 T, 109 K) exceeds its
conventional thermopower by a hundredfold and is significantly larger than the
thermopower of traditional thermoelectric materials. The Nernst effect has a
pronounced maximum near T_M=90 +/- 20 K=mu_0/kB (mu_0 is chemical potential at
T=0 K). A self-consistent theory without adjustable parameters shows that this
results from electrochemical potential pinning to the Weyl point energy at
T>=TM, driven by charge neutrality and Dirac band symmetry. Temperature and
field dependences of the Nernst effect, an even function of the charge
polarity, result from the intrinsically bipolar nature of the Weyl fermions.
Through this study, we offer an understanding of the temperature dependence of

conducted to minimize the transmit power under the target secrecy rate, the

To reduce computational complexity, a sequential parametric convex

work is then extended to the imperfect channel state information case with
norm-bounded channel errors. Furthermore, tightness of the relaxation for the

amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations and the eclipse contact phases permit
to put some constraints on the mass ratio, orbital inclination and the relative

When such a large number of channels dynamically change, the inherent

change, as the use of outdated channel information can result in severe
detection and precoding inaccuracies. For the downlink (DL) in particular, a
time division duplex (TDD) configuration synonymous with massive MIMO

Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the impact of mobility on
massive MIMO performance and consider ways to combat the potential limitations.

MIMO channel vector over time is inspected for vehicles moving up to 29 km/h.

perpendicular to the driving charge current, leading to a non-equilibrium spin

band structure of ReS$_2$, a transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductor with
a distorted 1T crystal structure. We find a large number of narrow valence
bands, which we attribute to the combined influence of the structural
distortion and spin-orbit coupling. We further image how this leads to a strong
in-plane anisotropy of the electronic structure, with quasi-one-dimensional
bands reflecting predominant hopping along zig-zag Re chains. We find that this
does not persist up to the top of the valence band, where a more
three-dimensional character is recovered with the fundamental band gap located
away from the Brillouin zone centre along $k_z$. These experiments are in good
agreement with our density-functional theory calculations, shedding new light
on the bulk electronic structure of ReS$_2$, and how it can be expected to
evolve when thinned to a single layer.

correlated with the large scale environment, and particularly the spin of halo
flips in filament. A consistent picture of halo spin evolution in different
environments is still lacked. Using N-body simulation we find that halo spin
with its environment evolves continuously from sheet to cluster, and the flip
of halo spin happens both in filament and nodes. For the flip in filament can
be explained by halo formation time and the migrating time when its environment
changes from sheet to filament. For low-mass haloes, they form first in sheets
and migrate into filaments later, so their mass and spin growth inside filament
are lower, and the original spin is still parallel to filament. For massive
haloes, they migrate into filaments first, and most of their mass and spin
growth are obtained in filaments, so the resulted spin is perpendicular to
filament. Our results well explain the overall evolution of cosmic web in the
cold dark matter model and can be tested using high-redshift data. The scenario
can also be tested against alternative models of dark matter, such as warm/hot
dark matter, where the structure formation will proceed in a different way.

Individuals may vary both in the task that they perform and in the persistence
with which they perform each task. Although both the distribution of
individuals among tasks and differences among individuals in behavioral
persistence can each impact collective behavior, we do not know if and how they
jointly affect collective outcomes. Here we use a detailed computational model
to examine the joint impact of colony-level distribution among tasks and
behavioral persistence of individuals, specifically their fidelity to
particular resource sites, on the collective tradeoff between exploring for new
resources and exploiting familiar ones. We developed an agent-based model of
foraging honey bees, parameterized by data from 5 colonies, in which we
simulated scouts, who search the environment for new resources, and individuals
who are recruited by the scouts to the newly found resources, i.e., recruits.
We found that for each value of persistence there is a different optimal ratio
of scouts to recruits that maximizes resource collection by the colony.
Furthermore, changes to the persistence of scouts induced opposite effects from
changes to the persistence of recruits on the collective foraging of the
colony. The proportion of scouts that resulted in the most resources collected
by the colony decreased as the persistence of recruits increased. However, this
optimal proportion of scouts increased as the persistence of scouts increased.
Thus, behavioral persistence and task participation can interact to impact a
colony's collective behavior in orthogonal directions. Our work provides new
insights and generates new hypotheses into how variation in behavior at both
the individual and colony levels jointly impact the trade-off between exploring
for new resources and exploiting familiar ones.

systems. One of the goals of MoD systems is to provide personalized
transportation services to passengers. This process is facilitated by a
centralized operator that coordinates the assignment of vehicles to individual
passengers, based on location data. However, current approaches assume that
accurate positioning information for passengers and vehicles is readily
available. This assumption raises privacy concerns. In this work, we address
this issue by proposing a method that protects passengers' drop-off locations
(i.e., their travel destinations). Formally, we solve a batch assignment
problem that routes vehicles at obfuscated origin locations to passenger
locations (since origin locations correspond to previous drop-off locations),
such that the mean waiting time is minimized. Our main contributions are
two-fold. First, we formalize the notion of privacy for continuous
vehicle-to-passenger assignment in MoD systems, and integrate a privacy
mechanism that provides formal guarantees. Second, we present a scalable
algorithm that takes advantage of superfluous (idle) vehicles in the system,
combining multiple iterations of the Hungarian algorithm to allocate a
redundant number of vehicles to a single passenger. As a result, we are able to
reduce the performance deterioration induced by the privacy mechanism. We
evaluate our methods on a real, large-scale data set consisting of over 11
million taxi rides (specifying vehicle availability and passenger requests),
recorded over a month's duration, in the area of Manhattan, New York. Our work
demonstrates that privacy can be integrated into MoD systems without incurring
a significant loss of performance, and moreover, that this loss can be further
minimized at the cost of deploying additional (redundant) vehicles into the
fleet.

considering a family of operators dual to supergravity modes, and show that the
OPE implies that there is no shift in the anomalous dimension to first order,
as expected. We specialize to the operator dual to the dilaton, and show that
the leading order singularity in the OPE reproduces the correct structure
constant. Finally, we consider an unprotected operator of conformal dimension
(2,2), and show that the leading order singularity and one of the subleading
singularies both reproduce the correct structure constant. We check that the
operator produced at subleading order using the OPE method is correct by
calculating a number of three point functions using a Mathematica package we

(fast-hi), fast to rise but quick to plateau (fast-flat), or late bloomers
(slow-late), which may either never achieve many citations, or do so many years

interesting phenomena, as illustrated for example by the holographic principle
or by the AdS/CFT and bulk-boundary correspondences. In particular, it has been
acknowledged for quite some time that boundaries can break gauge invariance,
and thereby turn gauge degrees of freedom into physical ones. There is however
no known systematic way of identifying these degrees of freedom and possible
associated boundary observables. Following recent work by Donnelly and Freidel,
we show that this can be achieved by extending the covariant Hamiltonian
formalism so as to make it gauge-invariant under arbitrary large gauge
transformations. This can be done at the expense of extending the phase space
by introducing new boundary fields, which in turn determine new boundary
symmetries and observables. We present the general framework behind this
construction, and find the conditions under which it can be applied to an
arbitrary Lagrangian. By studying the examples of Abelian Chern-Simons theory
and first order three-dimensional gravity, we then show that the new boundary
observables satisfy the known corresponding Kac-Moody affine algebras. This
shows that this new extended phase space formulation does indeed properly
describe the dynamical boundary degrees of freedom, and gives credit to the
results which have been previously derived in the case of diffeomorphism
symmetry. We expect that this systematic understanding of the boundary
symmetries will play a major role for the quantization of gravity in finite
regions.

intensive. Gaining analytical understanding of the solutions found by DNNs can
help us devise more efficient training algorithms, replacing the commonly used
mthod of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We analyze the dynamics of SGD and
show that, indeed, direct computation of the solutions is possible in many
cases. We show that a high performing setup used in DNNs introduces a
separation of time-scales in the training dynamics, allowing SGD to train
layers from the lowest (closest to input) to the highest. We then show that for
each layer, the distribution of solutions found by SGD can be estimated using a
class-based principal component analysis (PCA) of the layer's input. This
finding allows us to forgo SGD entirely and directly derive the DNN parameters
using this class-based PCA, which can be well estimated using significantly
less data than SGD. We implement these results on image datasets MNIST, CIFAR10
and CIFAR100 and find that, in fact, layers derived using our class-based PCA
perform comparable or superior to neural networks of the same size and
architecture trained using SGD. We also confirm that the class-based PCA often
converges using a fraction of the data required for SGD. Thus, using our method
training time can be reduced both by requiring less training data than SGD, and
by eliminating layers in the costly backpropagation step of the training.

of computing the maximum weight subset of the given set of polygons whose
intersection graph fulfills some sparsity condition. For example, we show that
one can approximate the maximum weight subset of polygons, such that the
intersection graph of the subset is planar or does not contain a cycle of
length $4$ (i.e., $K_{2,2}$). Our algorithm relies on a recursive partitioning

regime. Graphite surfaces exposed directly to the hydrogen plasma exhibit
numerous etch pits of various size and depth, indicating continuous defect
creation throughout the etching process. In contrast, anisotropic etching
forming regular and symmetric hexagons starting only from preexisting defects
and edges is seen in the remote plasma regime, where the sample is located
downstream, outside of the glowing plasma. This regime is possible in a narrow
window of parameters where essentially all ions have already recombined, yet a
flux of H-radicals performing anisotropic etching is still present. At the
required process pressures, the radicals can recombine only on surfaces, not in

radical recombination coefficient, such a found for quartz or pyrex. In the

determination from the $B_s\to K \ell \nu$ width. Furthermore, we calculate the
hadronic input for the binned observables of $B \to \pi \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B
\to K \ell^+ \ell^-$. In addition to the form factors, the nonlocal hadronic
matrix elements are obtained, combining QCD factorization and light-cone sum
rules with hadronic dispersion relations. We emphasize that, due to nonlocal
effects, the ratio of branching fractions of these decays is not sufficient for
an accurate extraction of the $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|$ ratio. Instead, we suggest to
determine the Wolfenstein parameters $A,\rho,\eta$ of the CKM matrix, combining
the branching fractions of $B \to K \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B \to \pi \ell^+
\ell^-$ with the direct $CP$-asymmetry in the latter decay. We also obtain the

From our analytical result, we can choose the optimal number of local

reach to a central node due to constraints in communication, and demonstrate

large-scale data set on the growth and asexual reproduction of two freshwater
planarian species, Dugesia japonica and Dugesia tigrina, which reproduce by
transverse fission and succeeding regeneration of head and tail pieces into new
planarians. We show that generation-dependent memory effects in planarian
reproduction need to be taken into account to accurately capture the
experimental data. To achieve this, we developed a new additive model that
mixes multiple size control strategies based on planarian size, growth, and
time between divisions. Our model quantifies the proportions of each strategy
in the mixed dynamics, revealing the ability of the two planarian species to
utilize different strategies in a coordinated manner for size control.
Additionally, we found that head and tail offspring of both species employ
different mechanisms to monitor and trigger their reproduction cycles. Thus, we
find a diversity of strategies not only between species but also between heads
and tails within species. Our additive model provides two advantages over
existing 2D models that fit a multivariable splitting rate function to the data
for size control: Firstly, it can be fit to relatively small data sets and can
thus be applied to systems where available data is limited. Secondly, it
enables new biological insights because it explicitly shows the contributions
of different size control strategies for each offspring type.

projection with the language of matrix product states (MPS) and matrix product
operators (MPO) as used in the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).
Specifically, spin-projected matrix product states (SP-MPS) are constructed as
$|\Psi^{(N,S,M)}_{SP-MPS}\rangle=\mathcal{P}_S|\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\rangle$,
where $\mathcal{P}_S$ is the spin projector for total spin $S$ and
$|\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\rangle$ is an MPS wavefunction with a given particle
number $N$ and spin projection $M$. This new ansatz possesses several
attractive features: (1) It provides a much simpler route to achieve
spin-adaptation (i.e. to create eigenfunctions of $\hat{S}^2$) compared to
explicitly incorporating the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry into the MPS. In
particular, since the underlying state in the SP-MPS uses only Abelian
symmetries, one does not need the singlet embedding scheme for non-singlet
states, as normally employed in spin-adapted DMRG, to achieve a single
consistent variationally optimized state. (2) Due to the use of
$|\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\rangle$ as its underlying state, the SP-MPS can be closely
connected to broken symmetry mean-field states. This allows to
straightforwardly generate the large number of broken symmetry guesses needed
to explore complex electronic landscapes in magnetic systems. Further, this
connection can be exploited in the future development of quantum embedding
theories for open-shell systems. (3) The sum of MPOs representation for the
Hamiltonian and spin projector $\mathcal{P}_S$ naturally leads to an
embarrassingly parallel algorithm for computing expectation values and
optimizing SP-MPS. (4) Optimizing SP-MPS belongs to the
variation-after-projection (VAP) class of spin projected theories.

robust Generalized Maximum-likelihood-type Unscented Kalman Filter (GM-UKF)
that is able to suppress observation and innovation outliers while filtering
out non-Gaussian measurement noise. Because the errors of the real and reactive
power measurements calculated using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) follow
long-tailed probability distributions, the conventional UKF provides strongly
biased state estimates since it relies on the weighted least squares estimator.
By contrast, the state estimates and residuals of our GM-UKF are proved to be
roughly Gaussian, allowing the sigma points to reliably approximate the mean
and the covariance matrices of the predicted and corrected state vectors. To
develop our GM-UKF, we first derive a batch-mode regression form by processing
the predictions and observations simultaneously, where the statistical
linearization approach is used. We show that the set of equations so derived
are equivalent to those of the unscented transformation. Then, a robust
GM-estimator that minimizes a convex Huber cost function while using weights
calculated via Projection Statistics (PS's) is proposed. The PS's are applied
to a two-dimensional matrix that consists of serially correlated predicted
state and innovation vectors to detect observation and innovation outliers.
These outliers are suppressed by the GM-estimator using the iteratively
reweighted least squares algorithm. Finally, the asymptotic error covariance
matrix of the GM-UKF state estimates is derived from the total influence
function. In the companion paper, extensive simulation results will be shown to
verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

requires significantly larger annihilation rates. Here, we point out a
completely new phenomenon, which we refer to as $\textit{relentless}$ dark

shortly after the departure from thermal equilibrium, dark matter particles
keep annihilating long after leaving chemical equilibrium, with a significant
depletion of the final relic abundance. Relentless annihilation occurs for $n

investigate, in the simpler context of Gaussian cMERA for free theories, the
extent to which the cMERA state $|\Psi^\Lambda\rangle$ with finite UV cut-off
$\Lambda$ can capture the spacetime symmetries of the ground state
$|\Psi\rangle$. For a free boson conformal field theory (CFT) in 1+1 dimensions
as a concrete example, we build a quasi-local unitary transformation $V$ that
maps $|\Psi\rangle$ into $|\Psi^\Lambda\rangle$ and show two main results. (i)
Any spacetime symmetry of the ground state $|\Psi\rangle$ is also mapped by $V$
into a spacetime symmetry of the cMERA $|\Psi^\Lambda\rangle$. However, while
in the CFT the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ (in terms of which all the
spacetime symmetry generators are expressed) is local, the corresponding cMERA
stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{\Lambda}(x) = V T_{\mu\nu}(x) V^{\dagger}$ is
quasi-local. (ii) From the cMERA, we can extract quasi-local scaling operators
$O^{\Lambda}_{\alpha}(x)$ characterized by the exact same scaling dimensions
$\Delta_{\alpha}$, conformal spins $s_{\alpha}$, operator product expansion
coefficients $C_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$, and central charge $c$ as the original

further motivate, discuss, and analyze the merger scenario through an analysis
of the 42 ks of Chandra/ACIS-I and JVLA/C and D polarization data. The X-ray
surface brightness profile reveals a remnant core reminiscent of the Bullet

1.7$\pm$0.1$\times$10$^{\text{44}}$ erg s$^{-\text{1}}$ and the X-ray

We implement a Monte Carlo dynamical analysis and estimate the merger velocity

0008.8+5215 is a low-mass version of the Bullet Cluster and therefore may prove
useful in testing alternative models of dark matter. We do not find significant
offsets between dark matter and galaxies, as the uncertainties are large with
the current lensing data. Furthermore, in the east, the BCG is offset from
other luminous cluster galaxies, which poses a puzzle for defining dark matter

In a test of the pulsar hypothesis, we have carried out an initial search of a
20 deg**2 area centered on the peak of the galactic center GeV excess.
Candidate pulsars were identified as a compact, steep spectrum continuum radio
source on interferometric images and followed with targeted single-dish
pulsation searches. We report the discovery of the recycled pulsar PSR
1751-2737 with a spin period of 2.23 ms. PSR 1751-2737 appears to be an
isolated recycled pulsar located within the disk of our Galaxy, and it is not
part of the putative bulge population of pulsars that are thought to be
responsible for the excess GeV emission. However, our initial success in this
small pilot survey suggests that this hybrid method (i.e. wide-field
interferometric imaging followed up with single dish pulsation searches) may be
an efficient alternative strategy for testing whether a putative bulge

decisiveness for denumerable Markov chains [1]. Roughly speaking, decisiveness
allows one to lift most good properties from finite Markov chains to
denumerable ones, and therefore to adapt existing verification algorithms to
infinite-state models. Decisive Markov chains however do not encompass
stochastic real-time systems, and general stochastic transition systems (STSs
for short) are needed. In this article, we provide a framework to perform both
the qualitative and the quantitative analysis of STSs. First, we define various
notions of decisiveness (inherited from [1]), notions of fairness and of
attractors for STSs, and make explicit the relationships between them. Then, we
define a notion of abstraction, together with natural concepts of soundness and
completeness, and we give general transfer properties, which will be central to
several verification algorithms on STSs. We further design a generic
construction which will be useful for the analysis of {\omega}-regular
properties, when a finite attractor exists, either in the system (if it is
denumerable), or in a sound denumerable abstraction of the system. We next
provide algorithms for qualitative model-checking, and generic approximation
procedures for quantitative model-checking. Finally, we instantiate our
framework with stochastic timed automata (STA), generalized semi-Markov
processes (GSMPs) and stochastic time Petri nets (STPNs), three models
combining dense-time and probabilities. This allows us to derive decidability
and approximability results for the verification of these models. Some of these
results were known from the literature, but our generic approach permits to
view them in a unified framework, and to obtain them with less effort. We also
derive interesting new approximability results for STA, GSMPs and STPNs.

that is modelled by a Lotka-Volterra system with environmental stochasticity.
There exist sharp results for deterministic Lotka-Volterra systems in the
literature but few for their stochastic counterparts. The food chain we analyze
consists of one prey and $n-1$ predators. The $j$th predator eats the $j-1$th
species and is eaten by the $j+1$th predator; this way each species only
interacts with at most two other species - the ones that are immediately above
or below it in the trophic chain. We show that one can classify, based on an
explicit quantity depending on the interaction coefficients of the system,
which species go extinct and which converge to their unique invariant
probability measure. Our work can be seen as a natural extension of the
deterministic results of Gard and Hallam '79 to a stochastic setting.
  As one consequence we show that environmental stochasticity makes species
more likely to go extinct. However, if the environmental fluctuations are
small, persistence in the deterministic setting is preserved in the stochastic
system. Our analysis also shows that the addition of a new apex predator makes,
as expected, the different species more prone to extinction.
  Another novelty of our analysis is the fact that we can describe the behavior
the system when the noise is degenerate. This is relevant because of the
possibility of strong correlations between the effects of the environment on
the different species.

distances among $k$ nodes in a planar graph of size $n$. Two na\""ive solutions
are to store the graph using $O(n)$ bits, or to explicitly store the distance
matrix with $O(k^2 \log{n})$ bits. The only lower bounds are from the seminal
work of Gavoille, Peleg, Prennes, and Raz [SODA'01], who rule out compressions
into a polynomially smaller number of bits, for {\em weighted} planar graphs,
but leave a large gap for unweighted planar graphs. For example, when
$k=\sqrt{n}$, the upper bound is $O(n)$ and their constructions imply an
$\Omega(n^{3/4})$ lower bound. This gap is directly related to other major open
questions in labelling schemes, dynamic algorithms, and compact routing.
  Our main result is a new compression of the planar graph metric into
$\tilde{O}(\min (k^2 , \sqrt{k\cdot n}))$ bits, which is optimal up to log
factors. Our data structure breaks an $\Omega(k^2)$ lower bound of Krauthgamer,
Nguyen, and Zondiner [SICOMP'14] for compression using minors, and the lower
bound of Gavoille et al. for compression of weighted planar graphs. This is an
unexpected and decisive proof that weights can make planar graphs inherently
more complex. Moreover, we design a new {\em Subset Distance Oracle} for planar
graphs with $\tilde O(\sqrt{k\cdot n})$ space, and $\tilde O(n^{3/4})$ query
time.
  Our work carries strong messages to related fields. In particular, the famous
$O(n^{1/2})$ vs. $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ gap for distance labelling schemes in planar

neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a) allowing the
network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b) biasing
the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a
graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the
proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent
and scaled to large graphs, with a runtime that is linear in the number of
edges. The proposed joint training approach convincingly outperforms many
existing methods on a wide range of tasks (multi-label classification on social

challenging because of the combination of algebraic equations and high state
dimensions. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing control
refinement approaches for DAE systems via the notions of (bi)simulation
relations and approximate simulation relations from computer science. The
quantified refinement accuracy is achieved by defining observation metrics over
a general system framework named transition systems. We employ the behavioral
theory to tackle dynamical systems and control problems in a more general
framework. Due to the difficulty in dealing with a DAE system directly, we
derive another system, which is behaviorally equivalent to the related DAE
system and in standard state space form, to provide ease for further control
refinement. Consequently, well-developed model reduction approaches can be
applied to obtain an abstract simplified system, which can be rewritten into a
DAE system again. Based on the (bi)simulation relations, approximate simulation
relations and the initialization conditions, we show that for any given
well-posed controller of the abstract model, we can always refine it to a
controller for the concrete model such that the two systems have the same
controlled output behavior or the distance between their output behavior is
bounded.

represent objects of interest (genes, proteins, drugs) and edges represent
relational ties among these objects (binds-to, interacts-with, regulates). This
approach has been highly successful owing to the theory, methodology and
software that support analysis and learning on graphs. Graphs, however, often
suffer from information loss when modeling physical systems due to their
inability to accurately represent multiobject relationships. Hypergraphs, a
generalization of graphs, provide a framework to mitigate information loss and
unify disparate graph-based methodologies. In this paper, we present a
hypergraph-based approach for modeling physical systems and formulate vertex
classification, edge classification and link prediction problems on
(hyper)graphs as instances of vertex classification on (extended, dual)
hypergraphs in a semi-supervised setting. We introduce a novel kernel method on
vertex- and edge-labeled (colored) hypergraphs for analysis and learning. The
method is based on exact and inexact (via hypergraph edit distances)
enumeration of small simple hypergraphs, referred to as hypergraphlets, rooted
at a vertex of interest. We extensively evaluate this method and show its
potential use in a positive-unlabeled setting to estimate the number of missing
and false positive links in protein-protein interaction networks.

dark matter could be comprised solely of Standard Model particles. The mass
range lies within an observationally viable window and the predicted merger
rate can be tested by future LIGO observations. In this paper, we argue that
non-thermal histories favor production of black holes near this mass range --
with heavier ones unlikely to form in the early universe and lighter black
holes being diluted through late-time entropy production. We discuss how this
prediction depends on the primordial power spectrum, the likelihood of black
hole formation, and the underlying model parameters. We find the prediction for
the preferred mass range to be rather robust assuming a blue spectral index
less than two. We consider the resulting relic density in black holes, and
using recent observational constraints, establish whether they could account
for all of the dark matter today.

propagate at different group velocities and move away from each other. This

the existence of these TL eigenmodes has been identified in momentum- or

In this study, we present a time domain measurement for the

detector. Spatial separation of charge- and spin-wave packets over a distance

paper investigates the role of frequency reuse in supporting UR2C in the
downlink. To this end, two frequency reuse schemes are considered:
user-specific frequency reuse (FRu) and BS-specific frequency reuse (FRb). For
a given unit frequency channel, FRu reduces the number of serving user
equipments (UEs), whereas FRb directly decreases the number of interfering base
stations (BSs). This increases the distance from the interfering BSs and the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) attains ultra-reliability, e.g. 99% SIR
coverage at a randomly picked UE. The ultra-reliability is, however, achieved
at the cost of the reduced frequency allocation, which may degrade overall
downlink rate. To fairly capture this reliability-rate tradeoff, we propose
ubiquitous rate defined as the maximum downlink rate whose required SIR can be
achieved with ultra-reliability. By using stochastic geometry, we derive
closed-form ubiquitous rate as well as the optimal frequency reuse rules for

methods are exponentially expensive in large parameter spaces, and Bayesian
optimization (BO) offers an elegant alternative for global optimization of
black box functions. In situations where the black box function can be
evaluated at multiple points simultaneously, batch Bayesian optimization is
used. Current batch BO approaches are restrictive in that they fix the number
of evaluations per batch, and this can be wasteful when the number of specified
evaluations is larger than the number of real maxima in the underlying
acquisition function. We present the Budgeted Batch Bayesian Optimization (B3O)

appropriate batch size for each iteration in an elegant way. To set the batch
size flexible, we use the infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) for
automatically identifying the number of peaks in the underlying acquisition

machine learning hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design for alloy

microjets is of great importance to world healthcare. It is thus crucial to
control the microjets, which are often induced by underwater shock waves. In
this contribution from fluid-mechanics point of view, we experimentally
investigate the effect of a shock wave on the velocity of a free surface
(microjet) and underwater cavitation onset in a microchannel, focusing on the
pressure impulse and peak pressure of the shock wave. The shock wave used had a
non-spherically-symmetric peak pressure distribution and a spherically
symmetric pressure impulse distribution [Tagawa et al., J. Fluid Mech., 2016,
808, 5-18]. First, we investigate the effect of the shock wave on the jet
velocity by installing a narrow tube and a hydrophone in different
configurations in a large water tank, and measuring the shock wave pressure and
the jet velocity simultaneously. The results suggest that the jet velocity
depends only on the pressure impulse of the shock wave. We then investigate the
effect of the shock wave on the cavitation onset by taking measurements in an
L-shaped microchannel. The results suggest that the probability of cavitation
onset depends only on the peak pressure of the shock wave. In addition, the jet
velocity varies according to the presence or absence of cavitation. The above
findings provide new insights for advancing a control method for high-speed
microjets.

effect of this quantum confined Stark phenomenon we study the optical response,

We discuss the consequences on the eigenfunction symmetries and the ensuing

the requirement for gradient evaluations. The efficiency of the algorithm is
illustrated on two examples: inversion of noisy pressure measurements in a PDE

for a weak between-host transmission rate. We determine the relative
contribution of environmental and direct transmission routes to the intensity
of outbreaks. We use an approximation method to simulate noise sustained
oscillations in a stochastic avian flu model with environmental and direct

of a rotation and a slowly varying standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (i.e.,
mean-reverting process). The intrinsic frequency of the damped deterministic
version of the system predicts the dominant period of outbreaks. We show, using
analytic computation of the intrinsic frequency and theoretical power spectral

prolateness, and average density. We find that the volume distribution derived
from the CDE simulation deviates from the volume distribution derived from the
$\Lambda$CDM simulation in the present-day universe, suggesting that the
presence of a coupled dark sector could be observable through this statistic.
We also find that the distributions of void ellipticity and prolateness are
practically indistinguishable among the three models over the redshift range
$z=0.0-1.0$, indicating that simple void shape statistics are insensitive to
small changes in dark sector physics. Interestingly, we find that the
distributions of average void density measured in each of the three simulations
are distinct from each other. In particular, voids on average tend to be
emptiest under a quintessence model, and densest under the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Our results suggest that it is the scalar field present in both alternative

mitigates this effect by slowing down the evacuation of matter from voids.

exhibit dependency on additional parameters that do not enter in the lower
bound. The question of whether the lower bound is tight and achievable by a
polynomial time algorithm remains open. In this paper, we constructively answer
this question and propose an algorithm, termed DICE, whose sample complexity
matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to a universal constant
factor. We also propose a related algorithm SLICE that has a slightly higher
sample complexity, but can be implemented as a mixed integer quadratic program
which makes it attractive in practice. Importantly, SLICE retains a critical
advantage of DICE in that its sample complexity only depends on quantities
present in the information theoretic lower bound. We anticipate that this
result will stimulate future search of computationally efficient sample-optimal
algorithms.

conditional sequence generative adversarial net which comprises of two
adversarial sub models, a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to
generate sentences which are hard to be discriminated from human-translated
sentences (i.e., the golden target sentences), And the discriminator makes
efforts to discriminate the machine-generated sentences from human-translated
ones. The two sub models play a mini-max game and achieve the win-win situation
when they reach a Nash Equilibrium. Additionally, the static sentence-level
BLEU is utilized as the reinforced objective for the generator, which biases
the generation towards high BLEU points. During training, both the dynamic
discriminator and the static BLEU objective are employed to evaluate the
generated sentences and feedback the evaluations to guide the learning of the
generator. Experimental results show that the proposed model consistently
outperforms the traditional RNNSearch and the newly emerged state-of-the-art
Transformer on English-German and Chinese-English translation tasks.

appropriate isolation of a single impurity is sufficient to recover the

stellar mass function at $z\sim0.6-7$, the black hole mass function at
$z\lesssim0.5$, the global ionizing emissivity at $z\sim2-5$ and the Thomson
scattering optical depth. The model reproduces a Magorrian relation in
agreement with observations at $z<0.5$ and predicts a decreasing black hole
mass towards higher redshifts at fixed total stellar mass. With the
implementation of an opening angle of 80 deg for quasar radiation,
corresponding to an observable fraction of ${\sim}23.4$ per cent due to
obscuration by dust, the model is able to reproduce the observed quasar
luminosity function at $z\sim0.6-6$. The stellar light from galaxies hosting
faint AGN contributes a significant or dominant fraction of the UV flux. At
high redshift, the model is consistent with the bright end quasar luminosity
function and suggests that the recent faint $z\sim4$ AGN sample compiled by
Giallongo et al. (2015) includes a significant fraction of stellar light.
Direct application of this luminosity function to the calculation of AGN
ionizing emissivity consequently overestimates the number of ionizing photons
produced by quasars by a factor of 3 at $z\sim6$. We conclude that quasars are
unlikely to make a significant contribution to reionization.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1607.01906",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  White noise analysis is used to derive the propagator of an open quantum
system consisting of a harmonic oscillator which is coupled to an environment
consisting of N multimode harmonic oscillators. The quantum propagators are
obtained after solving for the normal modes of the system-environment
interaction in order to decouple the coordinates in the Lagrangian describing
the dynamics of the system, the environment and their interaction with each
other. The decoupled Lagrangian is then used in the path integral corresponding
to the propagator of the system, with the path integral evaluated using white
noise analysis. The resulting propagator is then found to consist of a product
of N simple harmonic oscillator propagators. N-2 of these propagators
correspond to the degenerate normal mode frequencies of the system-environment
interaction, while the other 2 correspond to the non-degenerate normal mode
frequencies. This method of deriving the propagators greatly simplifies the
task of mathematically describing the dynamics of the open quantum system. The
ease of use of this method suggests that, together with its inherent
mathematical rigor, white noise analysis can be a powerful tool in analyzing
the dynamics of an open quantum system.

frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In
this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic
programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the
rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches
that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the
latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties
for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
  We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial
meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which
allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and
support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more
information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones,
but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the
first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
  In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the
revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to
the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the
belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our
operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a
logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions
to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program.
Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision
methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and
generalise the other method.

using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical

readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected

sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our

contrast to the density of transmission eigenvalues that is dictated by the
universal bimodal distribution, the spatial structures of the eigenchannels are
not universal and depend on the confinement geometry of the system. Here, we

relating the intensity profile to the shape of the confining waveguide.
Inverting this relationship enables the inverse design of the waveguide shape

degrading, displays the same hardness in the context of upgrading. That is,
suppose we are given such a channel and a corresponding input distribution. If
we upgrade (degrade) to a new channel with L output letters, we incur an
increase (decrease) in mutual information between input and output. We show
that a previously derived bound on the decrease in mutual information for the

binary-input case. That is, we are given a channel and an input distribution.

in mutual information is minimal. We give a simple characterization of such a
channel, which implies an efficient algorithm.

q2/3 behavior and not the well known q1/2 behavior. We also find that the
absorbance and the transmittance are increasing functions of the frequency and
the gate voltage. This outcome is useful for devices utilizing
photoconductivity and the photo-electric effect.

the sparsity structure of quantum impurity models, in which the interactions
couple only a small subset of the degrees of freedom. We further introduce an
adaptive truncation of the particle or hole excited spaces, which enables

  Bayesian Learning",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we provide non-asymptotic, probabilistic guarantees for
successful recovery of the common nonzero support of jointly sparse Gaussian
sources in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem. The support recovery
problem is formulated as the marginalized maximum likelihood (or type-II ML)
estimation of the variance hyperparameters of a joint sparsity inducing
Gaussian prior on the source signals. We derive conditions under which the
resulting nonconvex constrained optimization perfectly recovers the nonzero
support of a joint-sparse Gaussian source ensemble with arbitrarily high
probability. The support error probability decays exponentially with the number
of MMVs at a rate that depends on the smallest restricted singular value and
the nonnegative null space property of the self Khatri-Rao product of the
sensing matrix. Our analysis confirms that nonzero supports of size as high as
O($m^2$) are recoverable from $m$ measurements per sparse vector. Our derived
sufficient conditions for support consistency of the proposed constrained
type-II ML solution also guarantee the support consistency of any global
solution of the multiple sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) optimization whose
nonzero coefficients lie inside a bounded interval. For the case of noiseless
measurements, we further show that a single MMV is sufficient for perfect
recovery of the $k$-sparse support by M-SBL, provided all subsets of $k + 1$
columns of the sensing matrix are linearly independent.

tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, allowing them to be deployed
in practice. However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of
research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g. Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al. (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the
loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good
generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic
for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization.
Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can
exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent
symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models
corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to
reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically
without affecting its generalization properties.

spinning primary are performed. They aim to investigate the possibility of
using the post-Keplerian (pK) corrections to the orbiter's periods (draconitic,
anomalistic and sidereal) as a further opportunity to perform new tests of
post-Newtonian (pN) gravity. As a specific scenario, the S-stars orbiting the
Massive Black Hole (MBH) supposedly lurking in Sgr A$^\ast$ at the center of
the Galaxy is adopted. We, first, study the effects of the pK Schwarzchild,
Lense-Thirring and quadrupole moment accelerations experienced by a target star
for various possible initial orbital configurations. It turns out that the
results of the numerical simulations are consistent with the analytical ones in
the small eccentricity approximation for which almost all the latter ones were
derived. For highly elliptical orbits, the size of all the three pK corrections
considered turn out to increase remarkably. The periods of the observed S2 and
S0-102 stars as functions of the MBH's spin axis orientation are considered as
well. The pK accelerations considered lead to corrections of the orbital
periods of the order of 1-100d (Schwarzschild), 0.1-10h (Lense-Thirring) and
1-10^3s (quadrupole) for a target star with a=300-800~AU and e ~ 0.8, which
could be possibly measurable by the future facilities.

decision-makers. One purported advantage of replacing or augmenting human
judgment with computer models in high stakes settings-- such as sentencing,
hiring, policing, college admissions, and parole decisions-- is the perceived
""neutrality"" of computers. It is argued that because computer models do not
hold personal prejudice, the predictions they produce will be equally free from
prejudice. There is growing recognition that employing algorithms does not
remove the potential for bias, and can even amplify it if the training data
were generated by a process that is itself biased. In this paper, we provide a
probabilistic notion of algorithmic bias. We propose a method to eliminate bias
from predictive models by removing all information regarding protected
variables from the data to which the models will ultimately be trained. Unlike
previous work in this area, our framework is general enough to accommodate data
on any measurement scale. Motivated by models currently in use in the criminal
justice system that inform decisions on pre-trial release and parole, we apply
our proposed method to a dataset on the criminal histories of individuals at
the time of sentencing to produce ""race-neutral"" predictions of re-arrest. In
the process, we demonstrate that a common approach to creating ""race-neutral""
models-- omitting race as a covariate-- still results in racially disparate
predictions. We then demonstrate that the application of our proposed method to
these data removes racial disparities from predictions with minimal impact on
predictive accuracy.

output, standard FCNs use deconvolution layers to upsample the coarse map.
However, upsampling based on deconvolution increases the number of network
parameters and causes loss of detail because of interpolation. On the other
hand, dilated convolution is a new technique introduced recently that attempts
to capture multi-scale contextual information without increasing the network
parameters while keeping the resolution of the prediction maps high. We used
both a standard FCN and a dilated convolution based FCN for semantic
segmentation of the head sectioned images of the VKH dataset. Quantitative
results showed approximately 20% improvement in the segmentation accuracy when
using FCNs with dilated convolutions.

dynamics (ONEq) approach is different from the closed combined system +
environment in a global thermal state (CGTs) setup. Only after the open system
equilibrates will it be amenable to conventional thermodynamics descriptions,
thus quantum thermodynamics (QTD) comes at the end rather than assumed in the
beginning. We see the open system approach having the advantage of dealing with
nonequilibrium processes as many experiments in the near future will call for.
Because it spells out the conditions of QTD's existence it can also aid us in
addressing the basic issues in quantum thermodynamics from first principles in
a systematic way. We then study one broad class of open quantum systems where
the full nonequilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly, that of the quantum
Brownian motion of $N$ strongly coupled harmonic oscillators, interacting
strongly with a scalar field environment. Here we focus on the internal energy,
heat capacity and the Third Law. We show for this class of physical models,

positivity of the heat capacity and the validity of the Third Law from the

and on estimating the labels with a clustering procedure. These measures are
asymmetric. We study whether the asymmetry can improve classification. Out of
the three similarity measures, the bag similarity measure is the most robust
across different studies and achieves excellent results on four brain tissue

Here we show that the estimator is bounded by the $L^2(H^1)$-norm of the error
plus the temporal jumps under the one-sided parabolic condition $h^2 \lesssim

hypotheses such as $h \simeq \tau$ or $h^2\simeq \tau$; instead our result now
encompasses the practically relevant case for computations and allows for
locally refined spatial meshes. The constants in our bounds are robust with

also with respect to refinement and coarsening between time-steps, thereby

\mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{V}(f) \}$. Since a polynomial $f$ is stable if and only
if $\mathcal{I}(f) \cap \mathbb{R}_{>0}^n \ = \ \emptyset$, the notion offers a
novel geometric view underlying stability questions of polynomials. In this

hyperbolicity cones, where the latter ones are only defined for homogeneous
polynomials. Building upon this, for homogeneous polynomials we provide a tight
upper bound for the number of components in the complement $\mathcal{I}(f)^{c}$
and thus for the number of hyperbolicity cones of $f$. And we show that for $n
\ge 2$, a polynomial $f$ in $n$ variables can have an arbitrarily high number
of strictly convex and bounded components in $\mathcal{I}(f)^{c}$.

for the disintegration of weakly nonlinear narrow-banded wave fields and the

the main energy peak are excited and then follow an exponential growth law. As
a consequence of four wave mixing effect, these primary side-bands generate an
infinite number of additional side-bands, forming a triangular side-band
cascade. After saturation, it is expected that the system experiences a return
to initial conditions followed by a spectral recurrence dynamics. Much complex
nonlinear wave field motion is expected, when the secondary or successive
side-band pair that are created are also located in the finite instability gain
range around the main carrier frequency peak. This latter process is referred
to as higher-order MI. We report a numerical and experimental study that
confirm observation of higher-order MI dynamics in water waves. Furthermore, we
show that the presence of weak dissipation may counter-intuitively enhance wave

computational resources to the aggregate access load experienced at the BBU,
which can change in every air-interface access frame. The degree of savings
that can be achieved by adapting the resources is a tradeoff between savings,
adaptation frequency, and increased queuing time. If the time scale for
adaptation of the resource multiplexing is greater than the access frame

energy savings. In this paper we investigate the tradeoff by considering two
extreme time-scales for the resource multiplexing: (i) long-term, where the
computational resources are adapted over periods much larger than the access
frame durations; (ii) short-term, where the adaption is below the access frame

force on each plate and a net gas flow along the channel. The situation is
analysed numerically using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and
compared with analytical results where available. The influence of the ideally
specularly reflective wall is assessed by comparing with simulations using a
finite accommodation coefficient at the corresponding wall. The configuration
bears some similarity with a Crookes radiometer, where a non-symmetric
temperature profile at the radiometer vanes is generated by different
temperatures on each side of the vane, resulting in a motion of the rotor. The
described principle may find applications in pumping gas on small scales driven
by temperature gradients.

solving convex quadratic programming problems is proposed. This method takes
the proximal augmented Lagrangian method as the outer iteration. To solve the
proximal augmented Lagrangian subproblems, a homotopy method is presented as
the inner iteration. The homotopy method tracks the piecewise-linear solution
path of a parametric quadratic programming problem whose start problem takes an
approximate solution as its solution and the target problem is the subproblem
to be solved. To improve the performance of the homotopy method, the
accelerated proximal gradient method is used to obtain a fairly good
approximate solution that implies a good prediction of the optimal active set.
Moreover, a sorting technique for the Cholesky factor update as well as an
$\varepsilon$-relaxation technique for checking primal-dual feasibility and
correcting the active sets are presented to improve the efficiency and
robustness of the homotopy method. Simultaneously, a proximal-point-based
AL-Hom method which is shown to converge in finite number of steps, is applied
to linear programming. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems and
the problems from the CUTEr and Netlib test collections, support vector
machines (SVMs) and contact problems of elasticity demonstrate that PAL-Hom is
faster than the active-set methods and the parametric active set methods and is
competitive to the interior-point methods and the specialized algorithms
designed for specific models (e.g., sequential minimal optimization (SMO)

the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) IGRJ11215-5952, performed on
February 14, 2016, during the expected peak of its brief outburst, which
repeats every about 165 days. Timing and spectral analysis were performed
simultaneously in the energy band 0.4-78 keV. A spin period of 187.0 +/- 0.4 s
was measured, consistent with previous observations performed in 2007. The
X-ray intensity shows a large variability (more than one order of magnitude) on
timescales longer than the spin period, with several luminous X-ray flares
which repeat every 2-2.5 ks, some of which simultaneously observed by both
satellites. The broad-band (0.4-78 keV) time-averaged spectrum was well
deconvolved with a double-component model (a blackbody plus a power-law with a
high energy cutoff) together with a weak iron line in emission at 6.4 keV
(equivalent width, EW, of 40+/-10 eV). Alternatively, a partial covering model
also resulted in an adequate description of the data. The source time-averaged
X-ray luminosity was 1E36 erg/s (0.1-100 keV; assuming 7 kpc). We discuss the
results of these observations in the framework of the different models proposed
to explain SFXTs, supporting a quasi-spherical settling accretion regime,
although alternative possibilities (e.g. centrifugal barrier) cannot be ruled
out.

First, we observe a remarkable global convergence behavior of the algorithm's
iterates to the low-rank matrix for relevant, interesting cases, for which any
other state-of-the-art optimization approach fails the recovery. Secondly,
HM-IRLS exhibits an empirical recovery probability close to $1$ even for a
number of measurements very close to the theoretical lower bound $r (d_1 +d_2
-r)$, i.e., already for significantly fewer linear observations than any other
tractable approach in the literature. Thirdly, HM-IRLS exhibits a locally
superlinear rate of convergence (of order $2-p$) if the linear observations
fulfill a suitable null space property. While for the first two properties we
have so far only strong empirical evidence, we prove the third property as our
main theoretical result.

obstacle, the fluid settles into a stationary state displaying the emission of

future experiments aimed at identifying the occurrence of the Hawking-like

one can reason about two programs and as a special case about two executions of
a single program on different inputs. Relational program verification can be
used for reasoning about a broad range of properties, including equivalence and
refinement, and specialized notions such as continuity, information flow
security or relative cost. In a higher-order setting, relational program
verification can be achieved using relational refinement type systems, a form
of refinement types where assertions have a relational interpretation.
Relational refinement type systems excel at relating structurally equivalent
terms but provide limited support for relating terms with very different
structures.
  We present a logic, called Relational Higher Order Logic (RHOL), for proving
relational properties of a simply typed $\lambda$-calculus with inductive types
and recursive definitions. RHOL retains the type-directed flavour of relational
refinement type systems but achieves greater expressivity through rules which
simultaneously reason about the two terms as well as rules which only
contemplate one of the two terms. We show that RHOL has strong foundations, by
proving an equivalence with higher-order logic (HOL), and leverage this
equivalence to derive key meta-theoretical properties: subject reduction,
admissibility of a transitivity rule and set-theoretical soundness. Moreover,
we define sound embeddings for several existing relational type systems such as
relational refinement types and type systems for dependency analysis and
relative cost, and we verify examples that were out of reach of prior work.

the absorption trough varies little (if at all) on a rest-frame timescale of 2
yr. However, we detect a strong deepening of the absorption in the gas moving
at larger velocities (-20,000 - -23,000 km s-1). The data is consistent with a
multistreaming flow crossing our line of sight to the source. The transverse
velocity of the flow should be few thousand km s-1, similar to the rotation
velocity of the BLR gas (2,600 km s-1). By simply assuming Keplerian motion,
these two components must have similar locations, pointing to a common outflow
forming the BLR and the BAL. We speculate that BALs, mini-BALs, and NALs, are
part of a common, ubiquitous, accretion-disk outflow in AGN, but become
observable depending on the viewing angle towards the flow. The absorption
troughs suggest a wind covering only 20% of the emitting source, implying a
maximum size of 10^-3 pc for the clouds forming the BAL/BLR medium. This is
consistent with constraints of the BLR clouds from X-ray occultations. Finally,
we suggest that the low excitation broad emission lines detected in the spectra
of this source lie beyond the wind, and this gas is probably excited by the
shock of the BAL wind with the surrounding medium.

random and (only) its two endpoints can exchange messages and perform local
computations. Under this model, we study the following random process: The
first time a vertex is an endpoint of an active edge, it chooses a random
number, say $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$; then, in each round, the two
endpoints of the currently active edge update their values to their average. We
show that, if $G$ exhibits a two-community structure (for example, two
expanders connected by a sparse cut), the values held by the nodes will
collectively reflect the underlying community structure over a suitable phase
of the above process, allowing efficient and effective recovery in important
cases.
  In more detail, we first provide a first-moment analysis showing that, for a
large class of almost-regular clustered graphs that includes the stochastic
block model, the expected values held by all but a negligible fraction of the
nodes eventually reflect the underlying cut signal. We prove this property
emerges after a mixing period of length $\mathcal O(n\log n)$. We further
provide a second-moment analysis for a more restricted class of regular
clustered graphs that includes the regular stochastic block model. For this
case, we are able to show that most nodes can efficiently and locally identify
their community of reference over a suitable time window. This results in the
first opportunistic protocols that approximately recover community structure

volatility data while at the same time fitting the volatility surface
remarkably well, with very few parameters. However, managing the risks of
derivatives under rough volatility can be intricate since the dynamics involve
fractional Brownian motion. We show in this paper that surprisingly enough,
explicit hedging strategies can be obtained in the case of rough Heston models.
The replicating portfolios contain the underlying asset and the forward
variance curve, and lead to perfect hedging (at least theoretically). From a
probabilistic point of view, our study enables us to disentangle the
infinite-dimensional Markovian structure associated to rough volatility models.

propagation of a many-body system according to the time-dependent Schr\""odinger

(TDDFT) tells us that the single-particle density is, in principle, sufficient.
However, a practicable equation of motion (EOM) for the accurate time evolution
of the single-particle density is unknown. It is thus an obvious idea to
propagate a quantity which is not as reduced as the single-particle density but
less dimensional than the $N$-body wavefunction. Recently, we have introduced
time-dependent renormalized-natural-orbital theory (TDRNOT). TDRNOT is based on
the propagation of the eigenfunctions of the one-body reduced density matrix
(1-RDM), the so-called natural orbitals. In this paper we demonstrate how
TDRNOT is related to the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(MCTDHF) approach. We also compare the performance of MCTDHF and TDRNOT vs the
TDSE for single-photon double ionization (SPDI) of a 1D helium model atom. SPDI
is one of the effects where TDDFT does not work in practice, especially if one
is interested in correlated photoelectron spectra, for which no explicit
density functional is known.

the form of Hubbard $U$ corrected linear-response time-dependent DFT, or
`TDDFT+$U$'. Combined with calculated linear-response Hubbard $U$ parameters,
it may provide a computationally light, first-principles method for the
simulation of tightly-bound excitons on transition-metal ions. Our presented
implementation combines linear-scaling DFT+$U$ and linear-scaling TDDFT, but
the approach is broadly applicable. In detailed benchmark tests on two
Ni-centred diamagnetic coordination complexes with variable $U$ values, it is
shown that the Hubbard $U$ correction to an approximate adiabatic semi-local
exchange-correlation interaction kernel lowers the excitation energies of
transitions exclusively within the targeted localized subspace, by increasing
the exciton binding of the corresponding electron-hole pairs. This partially
counteracts the Hubbard $U$ correction to the exchange-correlation potential in
KS-DFT, which increases excitation energies into, out of, and within the
targeted localised subspace by modifying the underlying KS-DFT eigenspectrum.
This compensating effect is most pronounced for optically dark transitions
between localized orbitals of the same angular momentum, for which experimental
observation may be challenging and theoretical approaches are at their most
necessary. Overall, our results point to shortcomings in the contemporary
DFT+$U$ corrective potential, either in its functional form, or when applied to
transition-metal orbitals but not to ligand ones, or both.

convergence of the used loss function. The same holds true for methods as
sparse feature tracking when initial flow or depth information for new features
at arbitrary positions is needed. This makes it extremely important to have
techniques at hand that allow to obtain from only very few available
measurements a dense but still approximative sketch of a desired 2D structure

determine a dense reconstruction from sparse measurement. When facing
situations with only very sparse measurements, typically the number of
principal components is further reduced which results in a loss of
expressiveness of the basis. We overcome this problem and inject prior
knowledge in a maximum a posterior (MAP) approach. We test our approach on the

a loss function that allows to simultaneously optimize the unscaled relative

initial metric along the second derivative of the Chern scalar curvature. The
flow depends on the choice of a background metric, it always reduces to a
scalar equation and preserves some special classes of Hermitian structures, as
balanced and Gauduchon metrics. We show that the flow has always a unique
short-time solution and we provide a stability result when the background
metric is Kaehler-Einstein with nonpositive scalar curvature.

is proved using the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms and as well as relative
homeomorphism and clusres axioms. J. Milnor constructed the homology theory on
the category $Top^2_C$ of compact Hausdorff pairs and proved that on the given

homeomorphis and cluster axioms (see theorem 5 in [Mil]). Besides, using the
construction of weak homology theory, J.Milnor proved that constructed homology
theory satisfies partial continuity property on the subcategory $Top^2_{CM}$

$Top^2_C$ (see Lemma 5 in [Mil]). On the category of compact Hausdorff pairs,

this very problem. In particular, in the paper it is proved that any homology

our abundances agree with these works at the level of $\pm$0.05 dex or better
for the stars we have in common. However, we do find systematic differences
that make direct inferences difficult. Our analysis suggests that the selection
of line lists and atomic line data along with the adopted continuum level
influence these differences the most. At the same time, we confirm the positive
trends of abundances versus metallicity for Na, Mn, Ni, and to a lesser degree,
Al. A slight negative trend is observed for Ca, whereas Si and Cr tend to
follow iron. Our analysis allows us to determine the positively skewed normal

empirically reported to obey scale-invariant behavior --characterized by
power-law distributions up to some upper cut-off-- both in vitro and in vivo.
Elucidating whether such scaling laws stem from the underlying neural dynamics
operating at the edge of a phase transition is a fascinating possibility, as
systems poised at criticality have been argued to exhibit a number of important
functional advantages. Here we employ a well-known model for neural dynamics
with synaptic plasticity, to elucidate an alternative scenario in which
neuronal avalanches can coexist, overlapping in time, but still remaining
scale-free. Remarkably their scale-invariance does not stem from underlying
criticality nor self-organization at the edge of a continuous phase transition.
Instead, it emerges from the fact that perturbations to the system exhibit a
neutral drift --guided by demographic fluctuations-- with respect to endogenous
spontaneous activity. Such a neutral dynamics --similar to the one in neutral
theories of population genetics-- implies marginal propagation of activity,
characterized by power-law distributed causal avalanches. Importantly, our
results underline the importance of considering causal information --on which
neuron triggers the firing of which-- to properly estimate the statistics of
avalanches of neural activity. We discuss the implications of these findings
both in modeling and to elucidate experimental observations, as well as its
possible consequences for actual neural dynamics and information processing in
actual neural networks.

algorithm for recovering sparse signals in noisy linear regression models. The
performance of OMP depends on its stopping criteria (SC). SC for OMP discussed
in literature typically assumes knowledge of either the sparsity of the signal
to be estimated $k_0$ or noise variance $\sigma^2$, both of which are
unavailable in many practical applications. In this article we develop a
modified version of OMP called tuning free OMP or TF-OMP which does not require
a SC. TF-OMP is proved to accomplish successful sparse recovery under the usual
assumptions on restricted isometry constants (RIC) and mutual coherence of
design matrix. TF-OMP is numerically shown to deliver a highly competitive
performance in comparison with OMP having \textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$
or $\sigma^2$. Greedy algorithm for robust de-noising (GARD) is an OMP like
algorithm proposed for efficient estimation in classical overdetermined linear
regression models corrupted by sparse outliers. However, GARD requires the
knowledge of inlier noise variance which is difficult to estimate. We also
produce a tuning free algorithm (TF-GARD) for efficient estimation in the
presence of sparse outliers by extending the operating principle of TF-OMP to
GARD. TF-GARD is numerically shown to achieve a performance comparable to that
of the existing implementation of GARD.

alleviate the fine-tuning problem associated with the Higgs mass. When the
electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken radiatively \`a la
Coleman-Weinberg, the dilaton develops a vacuum expectation value away from the
origin to give an extra contribution to the Higgs potential so that the Higgs
mass becomes naturally around the electroweak scale. The ultraviolet scale of
the Higgs sector can be therefore much higher than the electroweak scale, as
the dilaton drives the Higgs mass to the electroweak scale. We also show that
the light dilaton in this scenario is a good candidate for dark matter of mass

(targets) given global knowledge of the network topology and its edge weights

weights are all initially unknown. We introduce selective harvesting, a variant
of AS where the next node to be queried must be chosen among the neighbors of
the current queried node set; the available training data for deciding which
node to query is restricted to the subgraph induced by the queried set (and
their node attributes) and their neighbors (without any node or edge
attributes). Therefore, selective harvesting is a sequential decision problem,
where we must decide which node to query at each step. A classifier trained in
this scenario suffers from a tunnel vision effect: without recourse to
independent sampling, the urge to query promising nodes forces classifiers to
gather increasingly biased training data, which we show significantly hurts the
performance of AS methods and standard classifiers. We find that it is possible
to collect a much larger set of targets by using multiple classifiers, not by
combining their predictions as an ensemble, but switching between classifiers
used at each step, as a way to ease the tunnel vision effect. We discover that
switching classifiers collects more targets by (a) diversifying the training
data and (b) broadening the choices of nodes that can be queried next. This
highlights an exploration, exploitation, and diversification trade-off in our
problem that goes beyond the exploration and exploitation duality found in
classic sequential decision problems. From these observations we propose D3TS,
a method based on multi-armed bandits for non-stationary stochastic processes
that enforces classifier diversity, matching or exceeding the performance of
competing methods on seven real network datasets in our evaluation.

control for nonlinear continuous-time systems. Unlike earlier approaches, we
provide event-triggered conditions without using the optimal cost as a Lyapunov
function candidate. Instead, we evaluate the time interval when the optimal
state trajectory enters a local set around the origin. The obtained
event-triggered strategy is more suitable for practical applications than the
earlier approaches in two directions. First, it does not include parameters
(e.g., Lipschitz constant parameters of stage and terminal costs) which may be
a potential source of conservativeness for the event-triggered conditions.
Second, the event-triggered conditions are necessary to be checked only at
certain sampling time instants, instead of continuously. This leads to the
alleviation of the sensing cost and becomes more suitable for practical
implementations under a digital platform. The proposed event-triggered scheme
is also validated through numerical simulations.

the properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves. For instance, the interaction

speed. When the collision frequencies are larger than the frequency of the

the effects of partial ionization, since there is a strong coupling between the

into consideration Hall's current and Ohm's diffusion in addition to the
friction due to collisions between different species. We apply our model to
plasmas composed of hydrogen and helium, and allow the ionization degree to be
arbitrary. By means of the analysis of the corresponding dispersion relation

rule out such a low mass. Assuming the nebular symmetry axis and binary orbital
plane are perpendicular, the data are more consistent with a post-main-sequence

molecules that are immersed in lipid bilayer membranes and modeled as
stochastic force dipoles. We specifically take into account the presence of the
bulk solvent which surrounds the two-dimensional fluid membrane. Two membrane
geometries are considered: the free membrane case and the confined membrane
case. Using the generalized membrane mobility tensors, we estimate the active
diffusion coefficient and the drift velocity as a function of the size of a
diffusing object. The hydrodynamic screening lengths distinguish the two
asymptotic regimes of these quantities. Furthermore, the competition between
the thermal and non-thermal contributions in the total diffusion coefficient is
characterized by two length scales corresponding to the two membrane
geometries. These characteristic lengths describe the crossover between
different asymptotic behaviors when they are larger than the hydrodynamic
screening lengths.

switching between two or more languages in a single conversation. Use of a
foreign word in a language; however, does not necessarily mean that the speaker
is code-switching because often languages borrow lexical items from other
languages. If a word is borrowed, it becomes a part of the lexicon of a
language; whereas, during code-switching, the speaker is aware that the
conversation involves foreign words or phrases. Identifying whether a foreign
word used by a bilingual speaker is due to borrowing or code-switching is a
fundamental importance to theories of multilingualism, and an essential
prerequisite towards the development of language and speech technologies for
multilingual communities. In this paper, we present a series of novel
computational methods to identify the borrowed likeliness of a word, based on
the social media signals. We first propose context based clustering method to
sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose
three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users
in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate
words indicating their borrowed likeliness. We compare these rankings with a
ground truth ranking constructed through a human judgment experiment. The
Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the
three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most
competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking
observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data
elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the
older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for
tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.

data and only maintain a single copy of files and chunks. Hence, it is widely
used in cloud storage systems to save storage space and network bandwidth.
However, the occurrence of deduplication can be easily identified by monitoring
and analyzing network traffic, which leads to the risk of user privacy leakage.
The attacker can carry out a very dangerous side channel attack, i.e.,
learn-the-remaining-information (LRI) attack, to reveal users' privacy
information by exploiting the side channel of network traffic in deduplication.
Existing work addresses the LRI attack at the cost of the high bandwidth
efficiency of deduplication. In order to address this problem, we propose a
simple yet effective scheme, called randomized redundant chunk scheme (RRCS),
to significantly mitigate the risk of the LRI attack while maintaining the high
bandwidth efficiency of deduplication. The basic idea behind RRCS is to add
randomized redundant chunks to mix up the real deduplication states of files
used for the LRI attack, which effectively obfuscates the view of the attacker,
who attempts to exploit the side channel of network traffic for the LRI attack.
Our security analysis shows that RRCS could significantly mitigate the risk of
the LRI attack. We implement the RRCS prototype and evaluate it by using three
large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
efficiency and efficacy of RRCS.

numerical self-heating of PIC simulations, which usually appears in
solid-density plasmas, is also well controlled by the proposed

state-of-the-art PIC codes. Especially, the electron heating/acceleration at
relativistically intense laser-solid interactions in the presence of large
scale pre-formed plasmas is re-investigated by this PIC code. Results indicate
that collisional damping (even though it is very week) can significantly
influence the electron heating/acceleration in front of the target. Furthermore
the Bremsstrahlung radiation will be enhanced by $2\sim3$ times when the solid
is dramatically heated and ionized. For the considered case, where laser is of

theory by applying methods of algebraic geometry to parametric Feynman
integrals for scalar theories. The transition to gauge theories is complicated
not only by the fact that their parametric integrand is much larger and more
involved. It is, moreover, only implicitly given as the result of certain
differential operators applied to the scalar integrand
$\exp(-\Phi_{\Gamma}/\Psi_{\Gamma})$, where $\Psi_{\Gamma}$ and $\Phi_{\Gamma}$
are the Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials of the Feynman graph $\Gamma$. In
the case of quantum electrodynamics we find that the full parametric integrand
inherits a rich combinatorial structure from $\Psi_{\Gamma}$ and
$\Phi_{\Gamma}$. In the end, it can be expressed explicitly as a sum over
products of new types of graph polynomials which have a combinatoric
interpretation via simple cycle subgraphs of $\Gamma$.

These are new generation numerical methods for PDEs with several advantageous
features: the support of arbitrary approximation orders on general polyhedral

properties, and a reduced computational cost thanks to static condensation and
compact stencil. After establishing the discrete setting, we introduce the
basics of HHO methods using as a model problem the Poisson equation. We
describe in detail the construction, and prove a priori convergence results for
various norms of the error as well as a posteriori estimates for the energy
norm. We then consider two applications: the discretization of the nonlinear
$p$-Laplace equation and of scalar diffusion-advection-reaction problems. The
former application is used to introduce compactness analysis techniques to
study the convergence to minimal regularity solution. The latter is used to
introduce the discretization of first-order operators and the weak enforcement
of boundary conditions. Numerical examples accompany the exposition.

be sound, meaning that, whatever its current state, the negotiation can still
be completed. In earlier work, Esparza and Desel have shown that deciding
soundness of a negotiation is Pspace-complete, and in Ptime if the negotiation
is deterministic. They have also extended their polynomial soundness algorithm
to an intermediate class of acyclic, non-deterministic negotiations. However,
they did not analyze the runtime of the extended algorithm, and also left open
the complexity of the soundness problem for the intermediate class. In the
first part of this paper we revisit the soundness problem for deterministic
negotiations, and show that it is Nlogspace-complete, improving on the earlier
algorithm, which requires linear space. In the second part we answer the
question left open by Esparza and Desel. We prove that the soundness problem
can be solved in polynomial time for acyclic, weakly non- deterministic
negotiations, a more general class than the one considered by them. In the
third and final part, we show that the techniques developed in the first two
parts of the paper can be applied to analysis problems other than soundness,
including the problem of detecting race conditions, and several classical
static analysis problems. More specifically, we show that, while these problems
are intractable for arbitrary acyclic deterministic negotiations, they become
tractable in the sound case. So soundness is not only a desirable behavioral
property in itself, but also helps to analyze other properties.

based on the finding of a conformally invariant (CI) attractor solution during
the early radiative expansion, requiring then the stationary presence of $\sim
1\, \%$ of coupled-DM and DE, since inflationary reheating. In these models,
coupled-DM fluctuations, even in the early radiative expansion, grow up to
non-linearity, as shown in a previous associated paper. Such early non-linear
stages are modelized here through the evolution of a top-hat density
enhancement. As expected, its radius $R$ increases up to a maximum and then
starts to decrease. Virial balance is reached when the coupled-DM density
contrast is just 25-26 and DM density enhancement is $\cal O$$(10\, \%)$ of
total density. Moreover, we find that this is not an equilibrium configuration
as, afterwards, coupling causes DM particle velocities to increase, so that the
fluctuation gradually dissolves. We estimate the duration of the whole process,
from horizon crossing to dissolution, and find $z_{horizon}/z_{erasing} \sim 3
\times 10^4$. Therefore, only fluctuations entering the horizon at $z \lesssim
10^9$-$10^{10}$ are able to accrete WDM with mass $\sim 100\, $eV -as soon as
it becomes non-relativistic- so avoiding full disruption. Accordingly, SCDEW
cosmologies, whose WDM has mass $\sim 100\, $eV, can preserve primeval
fluctuations down to stellar mass scale.

formula to obtain non-linear matter power spectra in models where cold neutral
dark matter and CHAMPs coexist in the early Universe. By using the observed
anomalous quadruple lens samples, we obtained the constraints on the lifetime

show that, for $r_{\rm Ch}=1$, the lifetime is bounded as $\tau_{\rm Ch} <

overlays F on a hypergraph H if V(H) is equal to V(G) and the subgraph of G
induced by every hyperedge of H contains some member of F as a spanning
subgraph.While it is easy to see that the complete graph on |V(H)| overlays F
on a hypergraph H whenever the problem admits a solution, the Minimum F-Overlay
problem asks for such a graph with the minimum number of edges.This problem
allows to generalize some natural problems which may arise in practice. For
instance, if the family F contains all connected graphs, then Minimum F-Overlay
corresponds to the Minimum Connectivity Inference problem (also known as Subset
Interconnection Design problem) introduced for the low-resolution
reconstruction of macro-molecular assembly in structural biology, or for the
design of networks.Our main contribution is a strong dichotomy result regarding
the polynomial vs. NP-hard status with respect to the considered family F.
Roughly speaking, we show that the easy cases one can think of (e.g. when
edgeless graphs of the right sizes are in F, or if F contains only cliques) are
the only families giving rise to a polynomial problem: all others are
NP-complete.We then investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem and
give similar sufficient conditions on F that give rise to W[1]-hard, W[2]-hard
or FPT problems when the parameter is the size of the solution.This yields an
FPT/W[1]-hard dichotomy for a relaxed problem, where every hyperedge of H must
contain some member of F as a (non necessarily spanning) subgraph.

element representation, and the deformable solid domain is modeled using a
Lagrangian mesh. The main issue of this work, since separately each of these
methods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches
in order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in
various geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method
incorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence
model. The discrete element method incorporates spherical and polyhedral
particles for stiff contact interactions. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model is
used for the deformable solid. We provide a detailed description of how to
couple the three solvers within a unified algorithm. The technique we propose
for rubber modeling/coupling exploits a simplification that prevents having to
solve a finite-element problem each time step. We also develop a technique to
reduce the domain size of the full system by replacing certain zones with
quasi-analytic solutions, which act as effective boundary conditions for the
lattice Boltzmann method. The major ingredients of the routine are are
separately validated. To demonstrate the coupled method in full, we simulate
slurry flows in two kinds of piston-valve geometries. The dynamics of the valve

significantly smaller than the most recent radio measurement, which indicates

popular recently in many areas of medical research because of their potential
to shorten development times and to increase patient response. However,
developing response-adaptive trial designs that offer patient benefit while
ensuring the resulting trial avoids bias and provides a statistically rigorous
comparison of the different treatments included is highly challenging. In this
paper, the theory of Multi-Armed Bandit Problems is used to define a family of
near optimal adaptive designs in the context of a clinical trial with a
normally distributed endpoint with known variance. Through simulation studies
based on an ongoing trial as a motivation we report the operating
characteristics (type I error, power, bias) and patient benefit of these
approaches and compare them to traditional and existing alternative designs.
These results are then compared to those recently published in the context of
Bernoulli endpoints. Many limitations and advantages are similar in both cases
but there are also important differences, specially with respect to type I
error control. This paper proposes a simulation-based testing procedure to
correct for the observed type I error inflation that bandit-based and adaptive
rules can induce. Results presented extend recent work by considering a
normally distributed endpoint, a very common case in clinical practice yet
mostly ignored in the response-adaptive theoretical literature, and illustrate
the potential advantages of using these methods in a rare disease context. We

this is indeed the case for giant pulses from PSR B1957+20: from baseband
observations at 327 MHz, we demonstrate that the observed voltages of a bright
pulse allow one to coherently descatter nearby ones. We find that while the
scattering timescale is $12.3\,\mu$s, the power in the descattered pulses is
concentrated within a span almost two orders of magnitude shorter, of
$\lesssim\!200\,$ns. This sets an upper limit to the intrinsic duration of the
giant pulses. We verify that the response inferred from the giant pulses is
consistent with the scintillation pattern obtained by folding the regular
pulsed emission, and that it decorrelates on the same timescale, of~$84\,$s. In
principle, with large sets of giant pulses, it should be possible to constrain
the structure of the scattering screen much more directly than with other
current techniques, such as holography on the dynamic spectrum and cyclic
spectroscopy.

shows two major thick dust layers along the line of sight (LOS) towards AX
J1745.6-2901. The LOS position and $N_{H}$ of these two layers depend on the
dust grain models with different grain size distribution and abundances. But
for all the 19 dust grain models considered, dust Layer-1 is consistently found
to be within a fractional distance of 0.11 (mean value: 0.05) to AX
J1745.6-2901 and contains only (19-34)% (mean value: 26%) of the total LOS
dust. The remaining dust is contained in Layer-2, which is distributed from the
Earth up to a mean fractional distance of 0.64. A significant separation
between the two layers is found for all the dust grain models, with a mean
fractional distance of 0.31. Besides, an extended wing component is discovered
in the halo, which implies a higher fraction of dust grains with typical sizes
$\lesssim$ 590 \AA\ than considered in current dust grain models. Assuming AX
J1745.6-2901 is 8 kpc away, dust Layer-2 would be located in the Galactic disk
several kpc away from the Galactic Centre (GC). The dust scattering halo biases
the observed spectrum of AX J1745.6-2901 severely in both spectral shape and

also intervenes along the LOS to Sgr A* and other nearby GC sources, a

optically-thin radiative cooling. We consider the cold, warm\, and hot phases
of the ISM separately; the analysis mostly considers the warm gas, which
occupies the bulk of the domain. Various physical variables have different
correlation lengths in the warm phase: $40 pc$, $50 pc$, and $60 pc$ for random
magnetic field, density, and velocity, respectively, in the midplane. The
correlation time of the random velocity is comparable to the eddy turnover
time, about $10^7 yr$, although it may be shorter in regions with higher star
formation rate. The random magnetic field is anisotropic, with the standard
deviations of its components $b_x/b_y/b_z$ having approximate ratios
$0.5/0.6/0.6$ in the midplane. The anisotropy is attributed to the global
velocity shear from galactic differential rotation, and locally inhomogeneous
outflow to the galactic halo. The correlation length of Faraday depth along the
$z$-axis, $120 pc$, is greater than for electron density, $60 - 90 pc$, and
vertical magnetic field, $60 pc$. Such comparisons may be sensitive to the
orientation of the line of sight. Uncertainties of the structure functions of
synchrotron intensity rapidly increase with the scale. This feature is hidden

cell body coupled with charge movement. With this motile element, voltage
changes generated by stimuli at their hair bundles drives the cell body and
that, in turn, amplifies the stimuli. In vitro experiments show that the
movement of these charges significantly increases the membrane capacitance,
limiting the motile activity by additionally attenuating voltage changes. It
was found, however, that such an effect is due to the absence of mechanical
load. In the presence of mechanical resonance, such as in vivo conditions, the
movement of motile charges is expected to create negative capacitance near the
resonance frequency. Therefore this motile mechanism is effective at high

it challenging to guarantee secrecy for any routing algorithm.
  We develop an efficient (in terms of energy consumption and computational
complexity) routing algorithm that does not rely on any information about the
locations and CSIs of the eavesdroppers. Our algorithm guarantees secrecy even
in disadvantaged wireless environments, where multiple eavesdroppers try to
eavesdrop each message, are equipped with directional antennas, or can get
arbitrarily close to the transmitter. The key is to employ additive random
jamming to exploit inherent non-idealities of the eavesdropper's receiver,
which makes the eavesdroppers incapable of recording the messages. We have
simulated our proposed algorithm and compared it with existing secrecy routing
algorithms in both single-hop and multi-hop networks. Our results indicate that
when the uncertainty in the locations of eavesdroppers is high and/or in

(116), {\itshape Chandra\} (151), and {\itshape RXTE\} (952) observations of
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), spanning 1997-2014. The resulting
observational library provides a comprehensive view of the physical, temporal
and statistical properties of the SMC pulsar population across the luminosity
range of $L_X= 10^{31.2}$--$10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. From a sample of 67 pulsars
we report $\sim$1654 individual pulsar detections, yielding $\sim$1260 pulse
period measurements. Our pipeline generates a suite of products for each pulsar
detection: spin period, flux, event list, high time-resolution light-curve,
pulse-profile, periodogram, and spectrum. Combining all three satellites, we
generated complete histories of the spin periods, pulse amplitudes, pulsed
fractions and X-ray luminosities. Some pulsars show variations in pulse period
due to the combination of orbital motion and accretion torques. Long-term
spin-up/down trends are seen in 12/11 pulsars respectively, pointing to
sustained transfer of mass and angular momentum to the neutron star on decadal
timescales. Of the sample 30 pulsars have relatively very small spin period
derivative and may be close to equilibrium spin. The distributions of
pulse-detection and flux as functions of spin-period provide interesting
findings: mapping boundaries of accretion-driven X-ray luminosity, and showing
that fast pulsars ($P<$10 s) are rarely detected, which yet are more prone to
giant outbursts. Accompanying this paper is an initial public release of the
library so that it can be used by other researchers. We intend the library to
be useful in driving improved models of neutron star magnetospheres and
accretion physics.

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and derived astrophysical parameters such as
stellar masses, effective temperature, radii, inclinations and critical
rotational velocities. We have confirmed the conservation of angular momentum
during the main sequence evolution; no signs of additional magnetic braking
were found. The inclination angles of the rotational axes are randomly
distributed, although an apparent excess of fast rotators with comparable
inclination angles has been observed. We have found a rotation rate of
$\upsilon/\upsilon_{\rm crit} \geq 0.5$ for several stars, whose
characteristics cannot be explained by current models. For the first time, we
have derived the relationship between mass and rotation rate of mCP stars, and
provide an analysis that links mass and rotation with magnetic field strength.
Our sample is unique and offers crucial input for forthcoming evolutionary
models that include the effects of magnetic fields for upper main sequence
stars.

it ideal for industrial applications, it can be questioned its robustness
regarding model uncertainties and external noises. In this paper we propose a
robust MPC controller that merges the simplicity in the design of MPC with
added robustness. In particular, our control system stems from the idea of
adding robustness in the prediction phase of the algorithm through a specific
robust Kalman filter recently introduced. Notably, the overall result is an
algorithm very similar to classic MPC but that also provides the user with the
possibility to tune the robustness of the control. To test the ability of the

BosonSampling in time rather than space and has since been used to make the
worlds largest BosonSampling experiment ever performed. We look at variations
to the traditional BosonSampling architecture by considering other quantum

in quantum metrology where measurements may be made more accurately than with
any classical method. Lastly, dealing with BosonSampling, we look at
reformulating the formalism of BosonSampling using a quantum optics approach.

efficiently generating large-photon Fock states, which are a type of quantum

order to study the evolution of the one-point probability density $\Psi$ of
finding a particle at a given location of phase space $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})$

point of view, with modest CPU and memory requirements, and it provides an
alternative to traditional N-body simulations when the goal is to study the
average properties of N-body systems, at the cost of abandoning the notion of
well-defined trajectories for each individual particle. In one spatial

the framework of the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills gauge-invariant theory with hedgehogs
in the Wilson loops, we have used the critical value of temperature for the
hedgehogs confinement phase ($T_c\sim 10^{18}$ GeV). This result gave us the
possibility to conclude that the SM shows a new physics (with contributions of
the $SU(2)$-triplet Higgs bosons) at the scale $\sim 10$ TeV. Theory predicts
the stability of the EW-vacuum and the accuracy of the MPP.

response of oscillatory systems, e.g. neurons, to sparse or weak stimulation.
Here we develop a framework for studying the response to a series of pulses
which are frequent or/and strong so that the standard PRC fails. We show that
in this case, the phase shift caused by each pulse depends on the history of
several previous pulses. We call the corresponding function which measures this
shift the phase response function (PRF). As a result of the introduction of the
PRF, a variety of oscillatory systems with pulse interaction, such as neural
systems, can be reduced to phase systems. The main assumption of the classical
PRC model, i.e. that the effect of the stimulus vanishes before the next one
arrives, is no longer a restriction in our approach. However, as a result of
the phase reduction, the system acquires memory, which is not just a technical
nuisance but an intrinsic property relevant to strong stimulation. We
illustrate the PRF approach by its application to various systems, such as
Morris-Lecar, Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models, and others. We show that the PRF
allows predicting the dynamics of forced and coupled oscillators even when the
PRC fails.

straightjacket real-life processes into simplistic or incomplete models that
fail to capture the essential features of the domain under study. Conventional
business process models only describe the lifecycles of individual instances
(cases) in isolation. Although process models may include data elements (cf.
BPMN), explicit connections to real data models (e.g., an entity relationship
model or a UML class model) are rarely made. Therefore, we propose a novel
approach that extends data models with a behavioral perspective. Data models
can easily deal with many-to-many and one-to-many relationships. This is
exploited to create process models that can also model complex interactions
between different types of instances. Classical multiple-instance problems are
circumvented by using the data model for event correlation. The declarative
nature of the proposed language makes it possible to model behavioral
constraints over activities like cardinality constraints in data models. The
resulting object-centric behavioral constraint (OCBC) model is able to describe
processes involving interacting instances and complex data dependencies. In
this paper, we introduce the OCBC model and notation, providing a number of
examples that give a flavour of the approach. We then define a set-theoretic
semantics exploiting cardinality constraints within and across time points. We
finally formalize conformance checking in our setting, arguing that evaluating
conformance against OCBC models requires diagnostics that go beyond what is
provided by contemporary conformance checking approaches.

on Theory and Practice of Software.
  The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. It aims at discussing
the lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and
analysis of realistic systems. Examples are:
  (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?
  (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?
  (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?
  (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?
  (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?
  We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the
basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present
different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them.
Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are
encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification

(UKF) for power system dynamic state estimation with non-Gaussian synchrophasor
measurement noise. The tuning of the parameters of our Generalized
Maximum-Likelihood-type robust UKF (GM-UKF) is presented and discussed in a
systematic way. Using simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system, its
performance is evaluated under different scenarios, including i) the occurrence
of two different types of noises following thick-tailed distributions, namely
the Laplace or Cauchy probability distributions for real and reactive power
measurements; ii) the occurrence of observation and innovation outliers; iii)
the occurrence of PMU measurement losses due to communication failures; iv)
cyber attacks; and v) strong system nonlinearities. It is also compared to the
UKF and the Generalized Maximum-Likelihood-type robust iterated EKF (GM-IEKF).
Simulation results reveal that the GM-UKF outperforms the GM-IEKF and the UKF
in all scenarios considered. In particular, when the system is operating under
stressed conditions, inducing system nonlinearities, the GM-IEKF and the UKF
diverge while our GM-UKF does converge. In addition, when the power measurement
noises obey a Cauchy distribution, our GM-UKF converges to a state estimate
vector that exhibits a much higher statistical efficiency than that of the
GM-IEKF; by contrast, the UKF fails to converge. Finally, potential
applications and future work of the proposed GM-UKF are discussed in concluding

empirically by q-exponential (Tsallis) functions. Based on the concepts of

which is uniquely labeled by a content and a context. In the measurement
terminology, the content is that which the random variable measures, whereas
the context describes the conditions under which this content is measured (in
particular, the set of other contents being measured ""together"" with this one).
Such a set of random variables is deemed noncontextual or contextual depending
on whether the distributions of the context-sharing random variables are or are
not compatible with certain distributions imposed on the content-sharing random
variables. In the traditional approaches, contextuality is either restricted to
only consistently-connected systems (those in which any two content-sharing
random variables have the same distribution) or else all
inconsistently-connected systems (those not having this property) are
considered contextual. In the Contextuality-by-Default theory, an
inconsistently connected system may or may not be contextual. There are several
arguments for this understanding of contextuality, and this note adds one more.
It is related to the fact that generally not each content is measured in each
context, so there are ""empty"" content-context pairs. It is convenient to treat
each of these empty pairs as containing a dummy random variable, one that does
not change the degree of contextuality in a system. These dummy random
variables are deterministic ones, attaining a single value with probability 1.
The replacement of absent random variables with deterministic ones, however,
can only be made if one allows for inconsistently-connected systems.

set of coordinate vectors and associated WLAN/WiFi signal strengths of the
available access points, a BPNN can be trained to output the expected signal
strengths for any input position within the region of interest (BPNN-RM). This

Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) based indoor localization systems with

environment is large and/or with high frequent changes. Different approaches
have been proposed to reduce workload, including fingerprinting deployment and
update efforts, but the performance degrades greatly when the workload is
reduced below a certain level. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization
scenario that applies metric learning and manifold alignment to realize direct
mapping localization (DML) using a low resolution radio map with single sample
of RSS that reduces the fingerprinting workload by up to 87\%. Compared to
previous work. The proposed two localization approaches, DML and $k$ nearest
neighbors based on reconstructed radio map (reKNN), were shown to achieve less
than 4.3\ m and 3.7\ m mean localization error respectively in a typical office
environment with an area of approximately 170\ m$^2$, while the unsupervised
localization with perturbation algorithm was shown to achieve 4.7\ m mean
localization error with 8 times more workload than the proposed methods. As for
the room level localization application, both DML and reKNN can meet the
requirement with at most 9\ m of localization error which is enough to tell
apart different rooms with over 99\% accuracy.

large frequencies, a maximum of four steps instead of two as in the case with

counter-intuitive interesting dynamics for large frequencies of the field:
unexpected two-step patterns are observed. When the frequency is large and
tuned such that it matches the uniaxial anisotropy, three-step patterns are
observed. We have equally observed that when the transverse signal possesses a
static part, steps maximize to six. These effects are semi-classically

physical entropy source. By performing real-time bit manipulation for bias
reduction, we were able to provide the memory of a personal computer with a
constant supply of ready-to-use physical random bits at a throughput of up to 4
Gbps. We pay special attention to the end-to-end entropy source model
describing how the entropy from physical sources is converted into bit entropy.
We confirmed the statistical quality of the generated random bits by revealing
the pass rate of the NIST SP800-22 test suite to be 65 % to 75 %, which is
commonly considered acceptable for a reliable random bit generator. We also
confirmed the stable operation of our random bit steaming system with long-term
bias monitoring.

extent. The connections among genes and their regulatory molecules, usually
transcription factors, and a descriptive model of such connections, are known
as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Elucidating GRNs is crucial to understand
the inner workings of the cell and the complexity of gene interactions. To
date, numerous algorithms have been developed to infer gene regulatory
networks. However, as the number of identified genes increases and the
complexity of their interactions is uncovered, networks and their regulatory
mechanisms become cumbersome to test. Furthermore, prodding through
experimental results requires an enormous amount of computation, resulting in
slow data processing. Therefore, new approaches are needed to expeditiously
analyze copious amounts of experimental data resulting from cellular GRNs. To
meet this need, cloud computing is promising as reported in the literature.
Here we propose new MapReduce algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks
on a Hadoop cluster in a cloud environment. These algorithms employ an
information-theoretic approach to infer GRNs using time-series microarray data.
Experimental results show that our MapReduce program is much faster than an
existing tool while achieving slightly better prediction accuracy than the
existing tool.

of modern technology, used in environmental monitoring, robotics, medical tools
as well as fundamental science. These devices rely on dedicated electronics to
generate their driving signal, resulting in an increased complexity and size.
Here, we present a new paradigm to achieve high-frequency mechanical actuation
based on the metal-insulator transition of VO$\mathrm{_2}$, where the steep
variation of its electronic properties enables to realize high-frequency
electrical oscillations. The dual nature of this phase change, which is both
electronic and structural, turns the electrical oscillations into an intrinsic
actuation mechanism, powered by a small DC voltage and capable to selectively
excite the different mechanical modes of a microstructure. Our results pave the
way towards the realization of micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems with
autonomous actuation from integrated DC power sources such as solar cells or
micro-batteries.
