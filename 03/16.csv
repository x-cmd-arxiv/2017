reveal a new regime, in which ballistic transport is not limited by scattering
with phonons or impurities, but by electron-hole collisions. The phenomenon
manifests itself in a negative four-terminal resistance that becomes visible
when the density of holes (electrons) is suppressed by gate-shifting the Fermi

densities transport is diffusive, and the measured conductivity is reproduced
quantitatively, with no fitting parameters, by including electron-hole

neutrality is governed by the same physics. Our results provide a textbook
illustration of a transport regime that had not been observed previously and
clarify the nature of conduction through charge-neutral graphene under

demonstrate that transport can be limited by a fully electronic mechanism,

entanglement monotone is proportional to a power of the area of the surface
dual to the link thus supporting a connection between entanglement and the
(simplicial) geometric properties of spin network states. We further extend
such analysis to the study of non-local correlations between two non-adjacent
regions of a generic spin network graph characterized by the bipartite
unfolding of an Intertwiner state. Our analysis confirms the interpretation of
spin network bonds as a result of entanglement and to regard the same spin
network graph as an information graph, whose connectivity encodes, both at the
local and non-local level, the quantum correlations among its parts. This gives
a further connection between entanglement and geometry.

disturbance or faults on electrical elements, closely followed by errors of

mathematical model to describe the cascading dynamics of transmission lines in
power networks. In particular, the direct current (DC) power flow equation is
employed to calculate the transmission power on the branches. By regarding the
disturbances on the elements as the control inputs, we formulate the problem of
determining the initial disturbances causing the cascading blackout of power
grids in the framework of optimal control theory, and the magnitude of
disturbances or faults on the selected branch can be obtained by solving the
system of algebraic equations. Moreover, an iterative search algorithm is
proposed to look for the optimal solution leading to the worst case of
cascading failures. Theoretical analysis guarantees the asymptotic convergence
of the iterative search algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are carried
out in IEEE 9 Bus System and IEEE 14 Bus System to validate the proposed
approach.

called a Poisson game. The resulting Poisson signaling game extends traditional
signaling games to include 1) exogenous evidence of deception, 2) an unknown
number of receivers, and 3) receivers of multiple types. We find closed-form
equilibrium solutions for a subset of Poisson signaling games, and characterize
the rates of deception that they support. We show that receivers with higher
abilities to detect deception can use crowd-defense tactics to mitigate
deception for receivers with lower abilities to detect deception. Finally, we
discuss how Poisson signaling games could be used to defend against the process

gamma-ray spectra support a uniform penetration of the cosmic rays with
energies above a few GeV through the clouds. We find a gradual increase in
grain opacity as the gas becomes more dense. The increase reaches a factor of
four to six in the cold molecular regions that are well shielded from stellar
radiation. Consequently, the X$_{CO}$ factor derived from dust is
systematically larger by 30% to 130% than the gamma-ray estimate. We also
evaluate the average gamma-ray X$_{CO}$ factorfor each cloud, and find that

dominated by the HOMO-1. In the parallel orientation we observe a double
plateau with an inner plateau that is produced by ionization from and
recombination back to an autoionizing state. Two pieces of evidence support
this idea. Firstly, by choosing a suitably tuned vacuum ultraviolet pump pulse
that directly excites the autoionizing state we observe a dramatic enhancement
of all harmonics in the inner plateau. Secondly, in certain circumstances, the
position of the inner plateau cut-off does not agree with the classical
three-step model. We show that this discrepancy can be understood in terms of a
minimum in the dipole recombination matrix element from the continuum to the
autoionizing state. As far as we are aware, this represents the first
observation of harmonic enhancement over a wide range of frequencies arising

with a mass of 1.6x10^7 Msun, co-spatial with the obscuring dust disc visible

continuum emission from the dust in this disc. NGC4697 is found to have a very
low molecular gas velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{gas}=1.65^{+0.68}_{-0.65}$

function is not fully sampled, but other mechanisms such as chemical
differentiation in a hard radiation field or morphological quenching also seem
to be required. We detect a Keplerian increase of the rotation of the molecular
gas in the very centre of NGC4697, and use forward modelling of the ALMA data

i-band mass-to-light ratio of $2.14_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$ Msun/Lsun (at the 99%

previous measurements from stellar kinematics. This increases confidence in the

between observations ranging from days to years. Our results are homogeneously

nuclei over the aforementioned ranges of timescales. The main variability
pattern is related to intrinsic changes in the sources, which are observed in
ten nuclei. Changes in the column density are also frequent, as they are
observed in six nuclei, and variations at soft energies, possibly related to
scattered nuclear emission, are detected in six sources. X-ray intraday
variations are detected in six out of the eight studied sources. Variations at
UV frequencies are detected in seven out of nine sources. A comparison between
the samples of Seyfert 1.8/1.9 and 2 shows that, even if the main variability
pattern is due to intrinsic changes of the sources in the two families, these
nuclei exhibit different variability properties in the UV and X-ray domains. In
particular, variations in the broad X-ray band on short time-scales
(days/weeks), and variations in the soft X-rays and UV on long time-scales
(months/years) are detected in Seyfert 1.8/1.9 but not in Seyfert 2. Overall,
we suggest that optically classified Seyfert 1.8/1.9 should be kept separated

anisotropic Dirac cone with elliptical constant energy counturs giving rise to
different velocities in different in-plane directions. The spin-momentum
locking of strained $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$ is shown to be modified and for
some strain configurations we see a non-zero spin component perpendicular to
the surface. Hence, strain control can be used to manipulate the spin degree of
freedom via the spin-orbit coupling. We show that for a thin film of
$\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$ the surface state band gap induced by coupling between
the opposite surfaces changes opposite to the bulk band gap under strain.
Tuning the surface state band gap by strain, gives new possibilities for the
experimental investigation of the thickness dependent gap and optimization of
optical properties relevant for, e.g., photodetector and energy harvesting
applications. We finally derive analytical expressions for the effective mass
tensor of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ class of materials as a function of strain and
electric field.

molecular dynamics simulations and hydrodynamic calculations. Specifically, we
consider a Lennard-Jones fluid in slit pores without slip at the interface and
show that the use of periodic boundary conditions in the directions along the
surfaces results in dramatic finite-size effects, in addition to that of the
physically relevant confining length. As in the simulation of bulk fluids,
these effects arise from spurious hydrodynamic interactions between periodic
images and from the constraint of total momentum conservation. We derive
analytical expressions for the correction to the diffusion coefficient in the
limits of both elongated and flat systems, which are in excellent agreement
with the molecular simulation results except for the narrowest pores, where the
discreteness of the fluid particles starts to play a role. The present work
implies that the diffusion coefficients for wide nanopores computed using
elongated boxes suffer from finite-size artifacts which had not been previously
appreciated. In addition, our analytical expression provides the correction to
be applied to the simulation results for finite (possibly small) systems. It
applies not only to molecular but also to all mesoscopic hydrodynamic
simulations, including Lattice-Boltzmann, Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics or
Dissipative Particle Dynamics, which are often used to investigate confined
soft matter involving colloidal particles and polymers.

modern communication technology as well as a powerful resource for building
quantum networks. Aside from large reverse isolation, a nonreciprocal device
suitable for applications must also have high efficiency (low insertion loss)
and low output noise. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown
that nonreciprocal behavior can be achieved in optomechanical systems, but
performance in these last two attributes has been limited. Here we demonstrate
an efficient, frequency-converting microwave isolator based on the
optomechanical interactions between electromagnetic fields and a mechanically
compliant vacuum gap capacitor. We achieve simultaneous reverse isolation of
more than 20 dB and insertion loss less than 1.5 dB over a bandwidth of 5 kHz.
We characterize the nonreciprocal noise performance of the device, observing
that the residual thermal noise from the mechanical environments is routed
solely to the input of the isolator. Our measurements show quantitative
agreement with a general coupled-mode theory. Unlike conventional isolators and
circulators, these compact nonreciprocal devices do not require a static
magnetic field, and they allow for dynamic control of the direction of
isolation. With these advantages, similar devices could enable programmable,
high-efficiency connections between disparate nodes of quantum networks, even
efficiently bridging the microwave and optical domains.

Until now, the common practice to investigate the directional characteristics
of millimeter-wave channels has been using a rotating horn antenna. The sounder
presented here is capable of performing horizontal and vertical beam steering
with the help of phased arrays. Thanks to fast beam-switching capability, the
proposed sounder can perform measurements that are directionally resolved both
at the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) as fast as 1.44 milliseconds compared
to the minutes or even hours required for rotating horn antenna sounders. This
does not only enable us to measure more points for better statistical inference
but also allows to perform directional analysis in dynamic environments.
Equally importantly, the short measurement time combined with the high phase
stability of our setup limits the phase drift between TX and RX, enabling
phase-coherent sounding of all beam pairs even when TX and RX are physically
separated and have no cabled connection for synchronization. This ensures that
the measurement data is suitable for high-resolution parameter extraction
algorithms. Along with the system design and specifications, this paper also
discusses the measurements performed for verification of the sounder.
Furthermore, we present sample measurements from a channel sounding campaign
performed on a residential street.

vibration-assisted tunneling processes in the regime $\omega <\Delta$, with the
superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, and for sharp resonant transmission
through the dot. When the energy $\varepsilon_0$ of the dot's level is close to
the Fermi energy $\mu$, i.e. $|\varepsilon_0-\mu|\ll \Delta$, inelastic Andreev
reflections dominate up to voltage $eV\gtrsim\Delta$. The inelastic
quasiparticle tunneling becomes the leading process when the dot's level is
close to the gap $|\varepsilon_0-\mu|\sim \Delta \pm \omega$. In both cases,
the inelastic tunneling processes appear as sharp and prominent peaks - not
broadened by temperature - in the $I$-$V$ characteristic and pave the way for
inelastic spectroscopy of vibrational modes even at temperatures $T \gg
\omega$. We also found that inelastic Andreev reflections as well as
quasiparticle tunneling induce a strong nonequilibrium state of the oscillator.
In different ranges on the dot's level, we found that the current produces: (i)
ground-state cooling of the oscillator with phonon occupation $n\ll 1$, (ii)
accumulation of energy in the oscillator with $n\gg 1$ and (iii) a mechanical
instability which is a precursor of self-sustained oscillations. We show that
ground-state cooling is achieved simultaneously for several modes of different
frequencies. Finally, we discuss how the nonequilibrium vibrational state can
be detected by the asymmetric behavior of the inelastic current peaks respect
to the gate voltage.

photometry from highly confused images, which we apply to Herschel and
ground-based far-infrared (FIR) and (sub-)millimeter (mm) data in the northern
field of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). There are two key
novelties. First, starting with a large database of deep Spitzer 24{\mu}m and
VLA 20cm detections that are used to define prior positions for fitting the
FIR/submm data, we perform an active selection of useful priors independently
at each frequency band, moving from less to more confused bands. Exploiting
knowledge of redshift and all available photometry, we identify hopelessly
faint priors that we remove from the fitting pool. This approach significantly
reduces blending degeneracies and allows reliable photometry to be obtained for
galaxies in FIR+mm bands. Second, we obtain well-behaved, nearly Gaussian flux
density uncertainties, individually tailored to all fitted priors in each band.
This is done by exploiting extensive simulations that allow us to calibrate the
conversion of formal fitting uncertainties to realistic uncertainties depending
on quantities directly measurable. We achieve deeper detection limits with high
fidelity measurements and uncertainties at FIR+mm bands. As an illustration of
the utility of these measurements, we identify 70 galaxies with z>3 and
reliable FIR+mm detections. We present new constraints on the cosmic star
formation rate density at 3<z<6, finding a significant contribution from z>3
dusty galaxies that are missed by optical-to-near-infrared color selection.
Photometric measurements for 3306 priors, including over 1000 FIR+mm detections

eliminates intermediate metastable states, indicating that flux is enhanced in

level embedding vectors from low level features. Despite the success, the
serving time is still the bottleneck due to expensive run-time computation of
multiple layers of dense matrices. GPGPU, FPGA, or ASIC-based serving systems
require additional hardware that are not in the mainstream design of most
commercial applications. In contrast, tree or forest-based models are widely
adopted because of low serving cost, but heavily depend on carefully engineered
features. This work proposes a Deep Embedding Forest model that benefits from
the best of both worlds. The model consists of a number of embedding layers and
a forest/tree layer. The former maps high dimensional (hundreds of thousands to
millions) and heterogeneous low-level features to the lower dimensional
(thousands) vectors, and the latter ensures fast serving.
  Built on top of a representative DNN model called Deep Crossing, and two
forest/tree-based models including XGBoost and LightGBM, a two-step Deep
Embedding Forest algorithm is demonstrated to achieve on-par or slightly better
performance as compared with the DNN counterpart, with only a fraction of
serving time on conventional hardware. After comparing with a joint
optimization algorithm called partial fuzzification, also proposed in this
paper, it is concluded that the two-step Deep Embedding Forest has achieved
near optimal performance. Experiments based on large scale data sets (up to 1
billion samples) from a major sponsored search engine proves the efficacy of
the proposed model.

science goals of ongoing and future cosmological surveys. In practice, with
imperfect data and incomplete redshift coverage, this requires making
assumptions about the evolution of w with redshift z. These assumptions can be
manifested in a choice of a specific parametric form, which can potentially
bias the outcome, or else one can reconstruct w(z) non-parametrically, by
specifying a prior covariance matrix that correlates values of w at different
redshifts. In this work, we derive the theoretical prior covariance for the
effective DE equation of state predicted by general scalar-tensor theories with
second order equations of motion (Horndeski theories). This is achieved by
generating a large ensemble of possible scalar-tensor theories using a Monte
Carlo methodology, including the application of physical viability conditions.
We also separately consider the special sub-case of the minimally coupled
scalar field, or quintessence. The prior shows a preference for tracking
behaviors in the most general case. Given the covariance matrix, theoretical
priors on parameters of any specific parametrization of w(z) can also be
readily derived by projection.

Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) provokes questions of their
origins, and what they can reveal about galaxy evolution theory. Here, we
predict the satellite stellar mass function of Magellanic Cloud-mass host
galaxies using abundance matching and reionization models applied to the
\textit{Caterpillar} simulations. Specifically focusing on the volume within
$50$~kpc of the LMC, we predict a mean of 4-8 satellites with stellar mass $M_*
> 10^4\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and 3-4 satellites with $80 < M_* \leq 3000\,
\mathrm{M_\odot}$. Surprisingly, all $12$ currently known satellite candidates
have stellar masses of $80 < M_* \leq 3000\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Reconciling the
dearth of large satellites and profusion of small satellites is challenging and
may require a combination of a major modification of the \mstarmhalo
relationship (steep, but with an abrupt flattening at $10^3\,
\mathrm{M_\odot}$), late reionization for the Local Group ($z_{\rm{reion}}
\lesssim 9$ preferred), and/or strong tidal stripping. We can more robustly
predict that $\sim 53\%$ of satellites within this volume were accreted
together with the LMC and SMC, and $\sim 47\%$ were only ever Milky Way
satellites. Observing satellites of isolated LMC-sized field galaxies is
essential to placing the LMC in context, and to better constrain the
\mstarmhalo relationship. Modeling known LMC-sized galaxies within $8$ Mpc, we
predict 1-6 (2-12) satellites with $M_* > 10^5\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ ($M_* >
10^4\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) within the virial volume of each, and 1-3 (1-7)
within a single $1.5^{\circ}$ diameter field of view, making their discovery
likely.

at wide orbital separation ($\ge$5 AU) is one of the goals of direct imaging.
Over the past 15 years, many surveys have placed strong constraints on the
occurrence rate of wide-orbit giants, mostly based on non-detections, but very
few have tried to make a direct link with planet formation theories. In the
present work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large
program with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical
sample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar
companions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat
distributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the
sub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75-5.7% at the 68% confidence
level (CL) within 20-300 AU and 0.5-75 $M_{Jup}$, which is compatible with
previously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions
of state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational
instability (GI) formation scenario by Forgan & Rice (2013), with and without
scattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered
populations, we would be able to detect more than 30% of companions in the 1-75
$M_{Jup}$ range (95% CL). With the 3 sub-stellar detections in our sample, we
estimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be
within 1.0-8.6% (95% CL). We also conclude that even though GI is not common,
it predicts a mass distribution of wide-orbit massive companions that is much
closer to what is observed than what the core accretion scenario predicts.
Finally, we associate the present paper with the release of the Direct Imaging
Virtual Archive (DIVA, http://cesam.lam.fr/diva/), a public database that aims
at gathering the results of past, present, and future direct imaging surveys.

transition crosses over to the short-range universality class. While the
location $s_*$ of this crossover has been known for 40 years, its physics has
not been fully understood, the main difficulty being that the standard

crossover. In this paper we propose another field-theoretic description which,
on the contrary, is weakly coupled near the crossover. We use this description
to clarify the nature of the crossover and make predictions about the critical

different UV descriptions provides a new example of infrared duality.

our recent results obtained studying high-z QSOs.
  We study the relations between the outflow velocity inferred from [O III]

archival XMM--Newton observations of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (XDINSs).
Our analysis revealed a narrow and phase-variable absorption feature in the
X-ray spectrum of RX J1308.6+2127. The feature has an energy of $\sim$740 eV
and an equivalent width of $\sim$15 eV. It is detected only in $\sim$ 1/5 of
the phase cycle, and appears to be present for the entire timespan covered by
the observations (2001 December - 2007 June). The strong dependence on the
pulsar rotation and the narrow width suggest that the feature is likely due to
resonant cyclotron absorption/scattering in a confined high-B structure close
to the stellar surface. Assuming a proton cyclotron line, the magnetic field
strength in the loop is B$_{loop} \sim 1.7 \times 10^{14}$ G, about a factor of
$\sim$5 higher than the surface dipolar magnetic field (B$_{surf} \sim 3.4
\times 10^{13}$ G). This feature is similar to that recently detected in
another XDINS, RX J0720.4-3125, showing (as expected by theoretical
simulations) that small scale magnetic loops close to the surface might be
common to many highly magnetic neutron stars (although difficult to detect with
current X-ray instruments). Furthermore, we investigated the available
XMM--Newton, data of all XDINSs in search for similar narrow phase-dependent
features, but could derive only upper limits for all the other sources.

perturbative contribution $E^{(2)}$ within multireference perturbation theory
(MRPT) is presented. The idea at the heart of our hybrid scheme --- based on a
reformulation of $E^{(2)}$ as a sum of elementary contributions associated with
each determinant of the MR wave function --- is to split $E^{(2)}$ into a
stochastic and a deterministic part. During the simulation, the stochastic part
is gradually reduced by dynamically increasing the deterministic part until one
reaches the desired accuracy. In sharp contrast with a purely stochastic MC
scheme where the error decreases indefinitely as $t^{-1/2}$ (where $t$ is the
computational time), the statistical error in our hybrid algorithm displays a
polynomial decay $\sim t^{-n}$ with $n=3-4$ in the examples considered here. If
desired, the calculation can be carried on until the stochastic part entirely
vanishes. In that case, the exact result is obtained with no error bar and no
noticeable computational overhead compared to the fully-deterministic
calculation. The method is illustrated on the F$_2$ and Cr$_2$ molecules. Even
for the largest case corresponding to the Cr$_2$ molecule treated with the
cc-pVQZ basis set, very accurate results are obtained for $E^{(2)}$ for an

mode classical Cepheids of the Magellanic Clouds observed by the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Although the overall incidence rate is very
low, about 1 per cent in each of the Magellanic Clouds, in the case of the SMC
and pulsation periods between 12 and 16d the incidence rate is nearly 40 per
cent. On the other hand, in the LMC the highest incidence rate is 5 per cent
for pulsation periods between 8 and 14d, and the overall amplitude of the
effect is smaller. It indicates that the phenomenon is metallicity dependent.
Typical modulation periods are between 70 and 300d. In nearly all stars the
mean brightness is modulated, which, in principle, may influence the use of
classical Cepheids for distance determination. Fortunately, the modulation of
mean brightness does not exceed 0.01 mag in all but one star. Also, the effect
averages out in typical observations spanning a long time base. Consequently,
the effect of modulation on the determination of the distance moduli is
negligible. The relative modulation amplitude of the fundamental mode is also
low and, with one exception, it does not exceed 6 per cent. The origin of the
modulation is unknown. We draw a hypothesis that the modulation is caused by
the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone that
shapes the famous Hertzsprung bump progression.

Surface and subsurface oil have different chemical and transport
characteristics and lumping them together would compromise the accuracy of the
resulting model. Without observational or computational constraints, it is thus
not possible to quantitatively predict oil spills based upon partial field
observations of surface and/or sub-surface oil. The primary challenge in
capturing the mass exchange is that the principal mechanisms are on the
microscale. This is a serious barrier to developing practical models for oil
spills that are capable of addressing questions regarding the fate of oil at
the large spatio-temporal scales, as demanded by environmental questions. We
use upscaling to propose an environmental-scale model which incorporates the
mass exchange between surface and subsurface oil due to oil droplet dynamics,
buoyancy effects, and sea surface and subsurface mechanics. While the mass
exchange mechanism detailed here is generally applicable to oil transport
models, it addresses the modeling needs of a particular to an oil spill model
[1]. This transport model is designed to capture oil spills at very large
spatio-temporal scales. It accomplishes this goal by specializing to
shallow-water environments, in which depth averaging is a perfectly good
approximation for the flow, while at the same time retaining mass conservation
of oil over the whole oceanic domain.

theory of Smith ideals for general operads in a symmetric monoidal category.
For a sufficiently nice stable monoidal model category and an operad satisfying
a cofibrancy condition, we show that there is a Quillen equivalence between a
model structure on Smith ideals and a model structure on algebra maps induced
by the cokernel and the kernel. For symmetric spectra, this applies to the
commutative operad and all Sigma-cofibrant operads. For chain complexes over a
field of characteristic zero and the stable module category, this Quillen
equivalence holds for all operads. This paper ends with a comparison between
the semi-model category approach and the $\infty$-category approach to encoding
the homotopy theory of algebras over Sigma-cofibrant operads that are not
necessarily admissible.

includes conventional slow-roll inflation, which is described in terms of a
strongly coupled QFT, but it also allows for qualitatively new models for the
very early Universe, where the dual QFT may be weakly coupled. The new models
describe a universe which is non-geometric at early times. While standard
slow-roll inflation leads to a (near-)power-law primordial power spectrum,
perturbative superrenormalizable QFT's yield a new holographic spectral shape.
Here, we compare the two predictions against cosmological observations. We use
CosmoMC to determine the best fit parameters, and MultiNest for Bayesian
Evidence, comparing the likelihoods. We find that the dual QFT should be
non-perturbative at the very low multipoles ($l \lesssim 30$), while for higher
multipoles ($l \gtrsim 30$) the new holographic model, based on perturbative
QFT, fits the data just as well as the standard power-law spectrum assumed in
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This finding opens the door to applications of
non-perturbative QFT techniques, such as lattice simulations, to observational
cosmology on gigaparsec scales and beyond.

Low mass stars are currently the best targets for searches for rocky
planets in the habitable zone of their host star. Over the last 13 years,
precise radial velocities measured with the HARPS spectrograph have identified
over a dozen super-Earths and Earth-mass planets (msin i<10Mearth ) around M
dwarfs, with a well understood selection function. This well defined sample
informs on their frequency of occurrence and on the distribution of their
orbital parameters, and therefore already constrains our understanding of
planetary formation. The subset of these low-mass planets that were found
within the habitable zone of their host star also provide prized targets for
future atmospheric biomarkers searches. Aims. We are working to extend this
planetary sample to lower masses and longer periods through dense and long-term
monitoring of the radial velocity of a small M dwarf sample. Methods. We
obtained large numbers of HARPS spectra for the M dwarfs GJ 3138, GJ 3323, GJ
273, GJ 628 and GJ 3293, from which we derived radial velocities (RVs) and
spectroscopic activity indicators. We searched them for variabilities,
periodicities, Keplerian modulations and correlations, and attribute the
radial-velocity variations to combinations of planetary companions and stellar
activity. Results. We detect 12 planets, of which 9 are new with masses ranging
from 1.17 to 10.5 Mearth . Those planets have relatively short orbital periods
(P<40 d), except two of them with periods of 217.6 and 257.8 days. Among these
systems, GJ 273 harbor two planets with masses close to the one of the Earth.
With a distance of 3.8 parsec only, GJ 273 is the second nearest known
planetary system - after Proxima Centauri - with a planet orbiting the

function depends on other players' decisions, but also the feasible decision
sets of all the players are coupled together with a globally shared affine
inequality constraint. Adopting the variational GNE, that is the solution of a
variational inequality, as a refinement of GNE, we introduce a primal-dual
algorithm that players can use to seek it in a distributed manner. Each player
only needs to know its local objective function, local feasible set, and a
local block of the affine constraint. Meanwhile, each player only needs to
observe the decisions on which its local objective function explicitly depends
through the interference graph and share information related to multipliers
with its neighbors through a multiplier graph. Through a primal-dual analysis
and an augmentation of variables, we reformulate the problem as finding the
zeros of a sum of monotone operators. Our distributed primal-dual algorithm is
based on forward-backward operator splitting methods. We prove its convergence
to the variational GNE for fixed step-sizes under some mild assumptions. Then a
distributed algorithm with inertia is also introduced and analyzed for
variational GNE seeking. Finally, numerical simulations for network Cournot

exhibit unique light-matter interactions and are promising for novel
optoelectronic devices. The performance of such devices is governed by
near-field coupling through, e.g., interlayer charge and/or energy transfer.
New concepts and experimental methodologies are needed to properly describe
two-dimensional heterointerfaces. Here, we report on interlayer charge and
energy transfer in atomically thin metal (graphene)/semiconductor (transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD, here MoSe$_2$)) heterostructures using a combination
of photoluminescence and Raman scattering spectroscopies. The photoluminescence
intensity in graphene/MoSe$_2$ is quenched by more than two orders of magnitude
and rises linearly with the photon flux, demonstrating a drastically shortened
($\sim 1~\tr{ps}$) room temperature MoSe$_2$ exciton lifetime. Key
complementary insights are provided from analysis of the graphene and MoSe$_2$
Raman modes, which reveals net photoinduced electron transfer from MoSe$_2$ to
graphene and hole accumulation in MoSe$_2$. Remarkably, the steady state Fermi
energy of graphene saturates at $290\pm 15~\tr{meV}$ above the Dirac point.
This behavior is observed both in ambient air and in vacuum and is discussed in
terms of band offsets and environmental effects. In this saturation regime,
balanced photoinduced flows of electrons and holes may transfer to graphene, a
mechanism that effectively leads to energy transfer. Using a broad range of
photon fluxes and diverse environmental conditions, we find that the presence
of net photoinduced charge transfer has no measurable impact on the near-unity
photoluminescence quenching efficiency in graphene/MoSe$_2$. This absence of
correlation strongly suggests that energy transfer to graphene is the dominant
interlayer coupling mechanism between atomically-thin TMDs and graphene.

Internet of Things (IoT) on the one hand enable fruitful and attractive

raising new challenges on handling IoT-empowered malware for cyber security.
Comparing with the malware propagation control scheme in traditional wireless
networks where nodes can be directly repaired and secured, in IoT, compromised
end devices are difficult to be patched. Alternatively, blocking malware via
patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical
solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the
proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and
limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This
article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important
intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited

aerial vehicles (UAVs), used as aerial base stations to collect data from
ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, is investigated. In particular, to
enable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices with a minimum total
transmit power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the
three-dimensional (3D) placement and mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV
association, and uplink power control. First, given the locations of active IoT
devices at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are
determined. Next, to dynamically serve the IoT devices in a time-varying
network, the optimal mobility patterns of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end,
based on the activation process of the IoT devices, the time instances at which
the UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3D
trajectory of each UAV is obtained in a way that the total energy used for the
mobility of the UAVs is minimized while serving the IoT devices. Simulation
results show that, using the proposed approach, the total transmit power of the
IoT devices is reduced by 45% compared to a case in which stationary aerial
base stations are deployed. In addition, the proposed approach can yield a
maximum of 28% enhanced system reliability compared to the stationary case. The
results also reveal an inherent tradeoff between the number of update times,
the mobility of the UAVs, and the transmit power of the IoT devices. In
essence, a higher number of updates can lead to lower transmit powers for the
IoT devices at the cost of an increased mobility for the UAVs.

context of dynamic nuclear polarization. Instead of spins, we study a set of
non-interacting fermions that are coupled locally to nuclear spins and tend to
hyperpolarize them. The induced hyperpolarization is a fingerprint of the
driven steady state of the fermions, which undergo an Anderson Localization
(AL) transition upon increasing the disorder. Our central result is that the
maximal hyperpolarization level is always found close to the localization
transition. In the limit of small nuclear moments the maximum is pinned to the
transition, and the hyperpolarization is strongly enhanced by multi-fractal
correlations in the critical state of the nearly localized driven system, its
magnitude reflecting multi-fractal scaling.

metastability of the electroweak vacuum of the Standard Model (SM) motivates
renewed study of false vacuum decay in quantum field theory. In this note, we
describe an approach to calculating quantum corrections to the decay rate of
false vacua that is able to account fully and self-consistently for the
underlying inhomogeneity of the solitonic tunneling configuration. We show that
this method can be applied both to theories in which the instability arises
already at the level of the classical potential and those in which the
instability arises entirely through radiative effects, as is the case for the
SM Higgs vacuum. We analyse two simple models in the thin-wall regime, and we
show that the modifications of the one-loop corrections from accounting fully
for the inhomogeneity can compete at the same level as the two-loop homogeneous
corrections.

theory. In this paper, we study this problem in the Centralized Local model,
where the goal is to decide whether an edge is part of the spanning subgraph by
examining only a small part of the input; yet, answers must be globally
consistent and independent of prior queries.
  Unfortunately, maximally sparse spanning subgraphs, i.e., spanning trees,
cannot be constructed efficiently in this model. Therefore, we settle for a
spanning subgraph containing at most $(1+\varepsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the
number of vertices and $\varepsilon$ is a given approximation/sparsity
parameter). We achieve query complexity of
$\tilde{O}(poly(\Delta/\varepsilon)n^{2/3})$, ($\tilde{O}$-notation hides
polylogarithmic factors in $n$). where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the
input graph. Our algorithm is the first to do so on arbitrary bounded degree
graphs. Moreover, we achieve the additional property that our algorithm outputs
a spanner, i.e., distances are approximately preserved. With high probability,
for each deleted edge there is a path of $O(poly(\Delta/\varepsilon)\log^2 n)$
hops in the output that connects its endpoints.

replicated} distributed shared memory (DSM) system that provides the
abstraction of shared read/write registers. Maintaining causal consistency in
distributed shared memory systems has received significant attention in the
past, mostly on {\em full replication} wherein each replica stores a copy of
all the registers in the shared memory. To ensure causal consistency, all
causally preceding updates must be performed before an update is performed at
any given replica. Therefore, some mechanism for tracking causal dependencies
is required, such as vector timestamps with the number of vector elements being
equal to the number of replicas in the context of full replication. In this
paper, we investigate causal consistency in {\em partially replicated systems},
wherein each replica may store only a subset of the shared registers. Building
on the past work, this paper makes three key contributions: 1. We present a
necessary condition on the metadata (which we refer as a {\em timestamp}) that
must be maintained by each replica to be able to track causality accurately.
The necessary condition identifies a set of directed edges in a {\em share
graph} that a replica's timestamp must keep track of. 2. We present an
algorithm for achieving causal consistency using a timestamp that matches the
above necessary condition, thus showing that the condition is necessary and
sufficient. 3. We define a measurement of timestamp space size and present a
lower bound (in bits) on the size of the timestamps. The lower bound matches
our algorithm in several special cases.

unconditional security of a protocol where all games are executed in parallel.

result reduces the security requirements for DI-QKD by allowing arbitrary

functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigated neurobiological
abnormalities of patients with OCD, there are concerns that should be
addressed. One concern is the validity of the hypothesis employed. Most studies
used seed-based analysis of the fronto-striatal circuit, despite the potential
for abnormalities in other regions. A hypothesis-free study is a promising
approach in such a case, while it requires researchers to handle a dataset with
large dimensions. Another concern is the reliability of biomarkers derived from
a single dataset, which may be influenced by cohort-specific features. Here, by
employing a recently developed machine-learning algorithm to avoid these
concerns, we identified the first OCD biomarker that is generalized to an
external dataset. We also demonstrated that the functional connectivities that
contributed to the classification were widely distributed rather than locally
constrained. Our generalizable classifier has the potential not only to deepen
our understanding of the abnormal neural substrates of OCD but also to find use

time-efficient. Further improving on these designs, we present a blockchain
using a proof of luck consensus protocol. Our proof of luck blockchain uses a

coherent relation between the dimensions of spacetime and the degrees of
freedom of fermionic spinors. A massless Dirac fermion generates new symmetries
corresponding to chirality spin and charge spin as well as conformal scaling
transformations. With the introduction of intrinsic W-parity, a massless Dirac
fermion can be treated as a Majorana-type or Weyl-type spinor in a
six-dimensional spacetime that reflects the intrinsic quantum numbers of
chirality spin. A generalized Dirac equation is obtained in the six-dimensional
spacetime with a maximal symmetry. Based on the framework of gravitational
quantum field theory proposed in Ref. \cite{YLWU} with the postulate of gauge
invariance and coordinate independence, we arrive at a maximally symmetric
gravitational gauge field theory for the massless Dirac fermion in
six-dimensional spacetime. Such a theory is governed by the local spin gauge
symmetry SP(1,5) and the global Poincar\'e symmetry P(1,5)= SO(1,5)$\ltimes
P^{1,5} $ as well as the charge spin gauge symmetry SU(2). The theory leads to
the prediction of doubly electrically charged bosons. A scalar field and
conformal scaling gauge field are introduced to maintain both global and local
conformal scaling symmetries. A generalized gravitational Dirac equation for
the massless Dirac fermion is derived in the six-dimensional spacetime. The
equations of motion for gauge fields are obtained with conserved currents in
the presence of gravitational effects. The dynamics of the gauge-type
gravifield as a Goldstone-like boson is shown to be governed by a conserved
energy-momentum tensor, and its symmetric part provides a generalized Einstein
equation of gravity. An alternative geometrical symmetry breaking mechanism for
the mass generation of Dirac fermions is demonstrated.

limited only to those functions that are guaranteed to sustain line rate, with
any traffic workload. In effect, this limits the maximum time to execute state

introduce a new benchmark ""Look into Person (LIP)"" that makes a significant

we feel is crucial for future developments in human-centric analysis. This
comprehensive dataset contains over 50,000 elaborately annotated images with 19

occlusions and background complexity. Given these rich annotations we perform

existing efforts on improving the feature discriminative capability, we solve
human parsing by exploring a novel self-supervised structure-sensitive learning
approach, which imposes human pose structures into parsing results without
resorting to extra supervision (i.e., no need for specifically labeling human
joints in model training). Our self-supervised learning framework can be
injected into any advanced neural networks to help incorporate rich high-level

well studied: 1) noise in the labels of subcategories derived from the general

we first obtain the semantic refinement subcategories from the text perspective
and remove the noise by the relevance-based approach. To suppress the search
error induced noisy images, we then formulate image selection and classifier
learning as a multi-class multi-instance learning problem and propose to solve
the employed problem by the cutting-plane algorithm. The experiments show
significant performance gains by using the generated data of our way on both

applied in all orders. Moreover, the long-range parts of these potentials are
fixed by the very accurate pi-N LECs as determined in the Roy-Steiner equations
analysis by Hoferichter, Ruiz de Elvira and coworkers. In fact, the
uncertainties of these LECs are so small that a variation within the errors
leads to effects that are essentially negligible, reducing the error budget of
predictions considerably. The NN potentials are fit to the world NN data below
pion-production threshold of the year of 2016.
  The potential of the highest order (N4LO) reproduces the world NN data with
the outstanding chi^2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever
accomplished for any chiral NN potential to date. The NN potentials presented

structure and reactions that allow for a comprehensive error analysis. In
particular, the consistent order by order development of the potentials will
make possible a reliable determination of the truncation error at each order.
Our family of potentials is non-local and, generally, of soft character. This
feature is reflected in the fact that the predictions for the triton binding

notion, namely Gaussian Random Projection based and Uniformly Random
Permutation based hashing schemes. The discrete indices representation nature
of IoM hashed codes enjoy serveral merits. Firstly, IoM hashing empowers strong
concealment to the biometric information. This contributes to the solid ground
of non-invertibility guarantee. Secondly, IoM hashing is insensitive to the
features magnitude, hence is more robust against biometric features variation.
Thirdly, the magnitude-independence trait of IoM hashing makes the hash codes
being scale-invariant, which is critical for matching and feature alignment.
The experimental results demonstrate favorable accuracy performance on

production is to manufacture products at a low cost, with high quality in the
shortest time. In this research different biomaterials, machinability
properties, surface characteristics, cutting tools, cutting fluids and
machining conditions for biomaterials with machinability capability are
reviewed. In the first step prosthetic acetabular (PA) hip is designed and
printed by using selective laser melting (SLM) process then current limitations
on fabrication are analyzed to optimize production process and obtain samples
with higher quality. The feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) in
machining is determined and In order to calculate dimensional deviation the
effect of tool path on tool deflection is modelled. The main focus of this
research is determining the machining conditions on surface quality and
osseointegration, work hardening and force analyzing of PA. Also the effect of
heat treatment on machinability and mechanical properties of produced parts is
determined.

evaluates interaction techniques in VR by measuring intentionally elicited
cognitive conflict. Through the analysis of the feedback-related negativity

designers to evaluate the effect of the variables of interest. We studied the
framework by applying it to the fundamental task of 3D object selection using
direct 3D input, i.e. tracked hand in VR. The cognitive conflict is
intentionally elicited by manipulating the selection radius of the target
object. Our first behavior experiment validated the framework in line with the
findings of conflict-induced behavior adjustments like those reported in other
classical psychology experiment paradigms. Our second EEG-based experiment
examines the effect of the appearance of virtual hands. We found that the
amplitude of FRN correlates with the level of realism of the virtual hands,

following observation: the answer to each query reveals some degree of
knowledge about the answer to another query because their answers stem from the
same underlying distribution that has produced the entire dataset. Exploiting
and refining this knowledge should allow us to answer queries more
analytically, rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also,
processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge of the
underlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster response times
for future queries.
  We call this novel idea---learning from past query answers---Database
Learning. We exploit the principle of maximum entropy to produce answers, which
are in expectation guaranteed to be more accurate than existing sample-based
approximations. Empowered by this idea, we build a query engine on top of Spark
SQL, called Verdict. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world query
traces from a large customer of a major database vendor. Our results
demonstrate that Verdict supports 73.7% of these queries, speeding them up by

remove the surface oxide from metallic aluminum and replace it with thin
fluoride layers in order to improve the performance of ultraviolet aluminum
mirrors. This ALE process is modified relative to existing methods through the
use of a chamber conditioning film of lithium fluoride, which is shown to
enhance the loss of fluorine surface species and results in conformal
layer-by-layer etching of aluminum oxide films. Etch properties were explored
over a temperature range of 225 to 300 {\deg}C with the Al2O3 etch rate
increasing from 0.8 to 1.2 {\AA} per ALE cycle at a fixed HF exposure of 60 ms
per cycle. The effective etch rate has a dependence on the total HF exposure,
but the process is shown to be scalable to large area substrates with a
post-etch uniformity of better than 2% demonstrated on 125 mm diameter wafers.
The efficacy of the ALE process in reducing interfacial native aluminum oxide

selection and parameter inference. In general, these algorithms require a high
computational effort to yield reliable estimates. One of the major challenges
in phylogenetics is the estimation of the marginal likelihood. This quantity is
commonly used for comparing different evolutionary models, but its calculation,
even for simple models, incurs high computational cost. Another interesting
challenge relates to the estimation of the posterior distribution. Often, long
Markov chains are required to get sufficient samples to carry out parameter
inference, especially for tree distributions. In general, these problems are
addressed separately by using different procedures. Nested sampling (NS) is a
Bayesian computation algorithm which provides the means to estimate marginal
likelihoods together with their uncertainties, and to sample from the posterior
distribution at no extra cost. The methods currently used in phylogenetics for
marginal likelihood estimation lack in practicality due to their dependence on
many tuning parameters and the inability of most implementations to provide a
direct way to calculate the uncertainties associated with the estimates. To
address these issues, we introduce NS to phylogenetics. Its performance is
assessed under different scenarios and compared to established methods. We
conclude that NS is a competitive and attractive algorithm for phylogenetic
inference. An implementation is available as a package for BEAST 2 under the
LGPL licence, accessible at https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/nested-sampling.

across MGCN and form a remarkable pressure difference, 21kPa, between the two

ambient temperature and the geometry of MGCN in detail. By further analysis of
the diffusive transport, we identified that the pressure difference relates to
the competition between ratchet transport and Knudsen diffusion. The
significant pressure difference could lead to 15 times enhancement of vapor
generation at least, which shows the wide applications of this nano-ratchet.

and application domains. Often in practice, an input graph can be considered as
an observed snapshot of a (potentially continuous) hidden domain or process.
Subsequent analysis, processing, and inferences are then performed on this
observed graph. In this paper we advocate the perspective that an observed
graph is often a noisy version of some discretized 1-skeleton of a hidden
domain, and specifically we will consider the following natural network model:
We assume that there is a true graph ${G^*}$ which is a certain proximity graph
for points sampled from a hidden domain $\mathcal{X}$; while the observed graph
$G$ is an Erd$\""{o}$s-R$\'{e}$nyi type perturbed version of ${G^*}$.
  Our network model is related to, and slightly generalizes, the
much-celebrated small-world network model originally proposed by Watts and
Strogatz. However, the main question we aim to answer is orthogonal to the
usual studies of network models (which often focuses on characterizing /
predicting behaviors and properties of real-world networks). Specifically, we
aim to recover the metric structure of ${G^*}$ (which reflects that of the
hidden space $\mathcal{X}$ as we will show) from the observed graph $G$. Our
main result is that a simple filtering process based on the \emph{Jaccard
index} can recover this metric within a multiplicative factor of $2$ under our
network model. Our work makes one step towards the general question of
inferring structure of a hidden space from its observed noisy graph
representation. In addition, our results also provide a theoretical
understanding for Jaccard-Index-based denoising approaches.

have been used to explain this classical magnetoresistance as a consequence of
sample disorder. The phenomenological Random Resistor Network model constructs
a grid of four-terminal resistors, each with a varying random resistance. The
Effective Medium Theory model imagines a smoothly varying disorder potential
that causes a continuous variation of the local conductivity. Here, we
demonstrate numerically that both models belong to the same universality class
and that a restricted class of the Random Resistor Network is actually
equivalent to the Effective Medium Theory. Both models are also in good
agreement with experiments on a diverse range of materials. Moreover, we show
that in both cases, a single parameter, i.e. the ratio of the fluctuations in
the carrier density to the average carrier density, completely determines the

spectral analysis with the additive table model {\it fits} file of the
Chakrabarti-Titarchuk two-components advective flow (TCAF) solution. From
spectral fit, we extract physical flow parameters, such as, Keplerian disk
accretion rate, sub-Keplerian halo rate, shock location and shock compression
ratio, etc. We also study the evolution of temporal properties, such as
observation of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), variation of
X-ray intensity throughout the outburst. From the nature of the variation of
QPOs, and accretion rate ratios (ARRs=ratio of halo to disk rates), we classify
entire 2005 outburst into two harder (hard-intermediate and hard) spectral
states. No signature of softer (soft-intermediate and soft) spectral states are
seen. This may be because of significant halo rate throughout the outburst.
This behavior is similar to a class of other short orbital period sources, such
as, MAXI~J1836-194, MAXI~J1659-152 and XTE~J1118+480. Here, we also estimate
probable mass range of the source, to be in between $4.75 M_\odot$ to $5.90

approach we are able to constrain a representative rotation curve extending out
to ~4 effective radii. This average rotation curve exhibits a significant drop
in rotation velocity beyond the turnover, with a slope of Delta(V)/Delta(R) =
$-0.26^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ in units of normalized coordinates V/V_max and
R/R_turn. This result confirms that the fall-off seen previously in some
individual galaxies is a common feature of our sample of high-z disks. We show
that this outer fall-off strikingly deviates from the flat or mildly rising
rotation curves of local spiral galaxies of similar masses. We furthermore
compare our data with models including baryons and dark matter demonstrating
that the falling stacked rotation curve can be explained by a high mass
fraction of baryons relative to the total dark matter halo (m_d>~0.05) in
combination with a sizeable level of pressure support in the outer disk. These
findings are in agreement with recent studies demonstrating that star-forming
disks at high redshift are strongly baryon dominated within the disk scale, and
furthermore suggest that pressure gradients caused by large turbulent gas
motions are present even in their outer disks. We demonstrate that these

model of two-degree-of-freedom platform whose attitude is determined by three

proposed, based on accurate first principle modeling of the muscles and the

is the so-called flatness-based control introduced by Fliess. The paper first
recalls the basics of this control technique and then it shows how it can be

open-loop kind of control, a proportional-integral controller is added on top
of it in order to add robustness with respect to modelling errors and external

increase under field removal, can be observed at both

inverse effect occurs exactly for those cases where the field orientation
favors the higher temperature/higher entropy phase. Our simulations show that
temperature changes of around 1 K can in principle be obtained at the

H^{\eta})$ in the limit $\eta \to 0$ and derive an effective system. In
geometries with a non-trivial topology, the limit system implies that certain
components of the effective fields vanish. We identify the corresponding
effective system and can predict, from topological properties of the

independence of irrelevant alternatives and Pareto optimality when the outcome
space is the convex hull of some finite set of alternatives. Individual and
collective preferences are assumed to be continuous and convex, which
guarantees the existence of maximal elements and the consistency of choice
functions that return these elements, even without insisting on transitivity.
We provide characterizations of both the domains of preferences and the social
welfare functions that allow for anonymous Arrovian aggregation. The domains
admit arbitrary preferences over alternatives, which completely determine an
agent's preferences over all mixed outcomes. On these domains, Arrow's
impossibility turns into a complete characterization of a unique social welfare
function, which can be readily applied in settings involving divisible
resources such as probability, time, or money.

systems running in parallel to act as a single simulation environment for a big

system as one single equation system, it is not ensured that systemwide
balances are fulfilled. If the exchanged data is a flow of a conserved
quantity, approximation errors can accumulate and make simulation results
inaccurate. The problem of approximation errors is typically addressed with
extrapolation of exchanged data. Nevertheless balance errors occur as
extrapolation is approximation. This problem can be handled with balance
correction methods which compensate these errors by adding corrections for the
balances to the signal in next coupling time step. This work aims at combining
extrapolation of exchanged data and balance correction in a way that the
exchanged signal not only remains smooth, meaning the existence of continuous
derivatives, but even in a way reducing the derivatives, in order to avoid
unphysical dynamics caused by the coupling. To this end, suitable switch and
hat functions are constructed and applied to the problem.

by numerical modeling using a variational principle that enables high number of

bending of the current lines indicates that there could be flux cutting effects
in rectangular prisms. The component of the critical current density in the
applied field direction may play a role, being the magnetization currents in a
bulk and a stack of tapes not identical.

are collected by the distributed sensors in the area and fused by a Fusion
Center (FC). But, for a given zone, the sensed PSDs by neighbor CR sensors may
contain a shared common component for a while. This component can be exploited

perturbation opens a full gap thus giving rise to a phase transition from 2D
TNLS to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). We thereby uncover a close
correlation between various topological phases. Remarkably, a strong spin Hall
effect, important for transport applications, is predicted in 2D TNLS. Finally,
a Na$_2$CrBi trilayer is proposed to realize the 2D TNLS without extrinsic
magnetic field. Our work not only proposes a new strategy for realizing 2D
TNLSs with truely closed NLs, but also reveals potential applications of TNLS
in spintronics.

cancellation decoding (SCD) and belief propagation decoding (BPD) are two
common approaches for decoding polar codes. SCD is sequential in nature while
BPD can run in parallel. Thus BPD is more attractive for low latency
applications. However BPD has some performance degradation at higher SNR when
compared with SCD. Concatenating LDPC with Polar codes is one popular approach
to enhance the performance of BPD , where a short LDPC code is used as an outer

to construct concatenated LDPC-Polar code, which not only outperforms
conventional BPD and existing concatenated LDPC-Polar code but also shows a
performance improvement of 0.5 dB at higher SNR regime when compared with SCD.

and defending learning methods. Concurrently, a different line of research has
tackled a very similar problem: In digital watermarking information are
embedded in a signal in the presence of an adversary. As a consequence, this
research field has also extensively studied techniques for attacking and
defending watermarking methods.
  The two research communities have worked in parallel so far, unnoticeably
developing similar attack and defense strategies. This paper is a first effort
to bring these communities together. To this end, we present a unified notation
of black-box attacks against machine learning and watermarking that reveals the
similarity of both settings. To demonstrate the efficacy of this unified view,
we apply concepts from watermarking to machine learning and vice versa. We show
that countermeasures from watermarking can mitigate recent model-extraction
attacks and, similarly, that techniques for hardening machine learning can fend
off oracle attacks against watermarks. Our work provides a conceptual link
between two research fields and thereby opens novel directions for improving
the security of both, machine learning and digital watermarking.

observed throughout the energy range ($E_{\omega} \sim 1.25 eV - 1.47 eV$)

detuned from both the A- and B-exciton resonances. A 60-fold enhancement of the

eV$, energetically detuned by $\Delta E = E_{2\omega} - E_C = -0.26 eV$ from
the C-resonance ($E_{C} = 2.75 eV$). The pronounced spectral dependence of the
electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation signal reflects the
bandstructure and wave function admixture and exhibits particularly strong
tunability below the C-resonance, in good agreement with Density Functional

function to be positive, in the sense that all the series coefficients are
positive, using an involved theory of special functions. In contrast to the
simplicity of the statement, the method was surprisingly difficult. This
dependency motivated further research for positivity of (quasi-)rational
functions. More and more (quasi-)rational functions have been proven to be
positive, and some of the proofs are even quite simple. However, there are also
others whose positivity are still open conjectures. In this talk, we focus on a
less difficult but also interesting question to decide whether the diagonal of
a given quasi-rational function is ultimately positive, especially for the one
conjectured to be positive by Kauers in 2007. To solve this question, it
suffices to compute the asymptotics of the diagonal coefficients, which can be
done by the multivariate singularity analysis developed by Baryshnikov,
Pemantle and Wilson. Note that the ultimate positivity is a necessary condition
for the positivity, and therefore can be used to either exclude the nonpositive

represents a necessary and sufficient steering criterion. The demonstrated

clouds, with up to several thousand stars per cluster. They are thought to be
the birthplace of most stars and therefore play an important role in our
understanding of star formation, a fundamental problem in astrophysics. The
initial conditions of the molecular cloud establish its dynamical history until
the stellar cluster is born. However, the evolution of the cloud's angular
momentum during cluster formation is not well understood. Current observations
have suggested that turbulence scrambles the angular momentum of the
cluster-forming cloud, preventing spin alignment amongst stars within a
cluster. Here we use asteroseismology to measure the inclination angles of spin
axes in 48 stars from the two old open clusters NGC~6791 and NGC~6819. The
stars within each cluster show strong alignment. Three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of proto-cluster formation show that at least 50 %
of the initial proto-cluster kinetic energy has to be rotational in order to
obtain strong stellar-spin alignment within a cluster. Our result indicates
that the global angular momentum of the cluster-forming clouds was efficiently
transferred to each star and that its imprint has survived after several
gigayears since the clusters formed.

saturating at values of about 10e-5. Depending on whether the intensity is

line with fixed branched locus and fixed ramification data. An equivalent
description is given by factorisations in the symmetric group. Simple double
Hurwitz numbers are a class of Hurwitz-type counts of specific interest. In
recent years a related counting problem in the context of random matrix theory
was introduced as so-called monotone Hurwitz numbers. These can be viewed as a
desymmetrised version of the Hurwitz-problem. A combinatorial interpolation
between simple and monotone double Hurwitz numbers was introduced as mixed
double Hurwitz numbers and it was proved that these objects are piecewise
polynomial in a certain sense. Moreover, the notion of strictly monotone
Hurwitz numbers has risen interest as it is equivalent to a certain
Grothendieck dessins d'enfant count. In this paper, we introduce a
combinatorial interpolation between simple, monotone and strictly monotone
double Hurwitz numbers as \textit{triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers}. Our aim
is twofold: Using a connection between triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers and
tropical covers in terms of so-called monodromy graphs, we give algorithms to
compute the polynomials for triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers in all genera
using Erhart theory. We further use this approach to study the wall-crossing
behaviour of triply interpolated Hurwitz numbers in genus $0$ in terms of
related Hurwitz-type counts. All those results specialise to the extremal cases

mixing in massive stars by revealing a population of fast-rotating objects with
apparently normal surface nitrogen abundances. However, several questions have
arisen because of a number of issues, which have rendered a reinvestigation
necessary; these issues include the presence of numerous upper limits for the
nitrogen abundance, unknown multiplicity status, and a mix of stars with
different physical properties, such as their mass and evolutionary state, which
are known to control the amount of rotational mixing. Methods: We have
carefully selected a large sample of bright, fast-rotating early-type stars of
our Galaxy (40 objects with spectral types between B0.5 and O4). Their
high-quality, high-resolution optical spectra were then analysed with the
stellar atmosphere modelling codes DETAIL/SURFACE or CMFGEN, depending on the
temperature of the target. Several internal and external checks were performed
to validate our methods; notably, we compared our results with literature data
for some well-known objects, studied the effect of gravity darkening, or
confronted the results provided by the two codes for stars amenable to both
analyses. Furthermore, we studied the radial velocities of the stars to assess
their binarity. Results: This first part of our study presents our methods and
provides the derived stellar parameters, He, CNO abundances, and the
multiplicity status of every star of the sample. It is the first time that He
and CNO abundances of such a large number of Galactic massive fast rotators are
determined in a homogeneous way.

circumstellar matter, that we term disk-originated matter (DOM), hours to days

definition for early excess light, replacing the definition of excess light
relative to a power-law fit to the rising luminosity. We then examine the light
curves of the SNe Ia iPTF14atg and SN 2012cg, and find that the collision of
the ejecta with a DOM in the frame of the DD scenario can account for their
early excess emission. Thus, early excess light does not necessarily imply the
presence of a stellar companion in the frame of the single-degenerate scenario.
Our findings further increase the variety of phenomena that the DD scenario can
account for, and emphasize the need to consider all different SN Ia scenarios

group of three gas-rich UDGs have stellar and gaseous properties that are
compatible with a recently proposed theoretical mechanism for the formation of
UDGs, based on feedback-driven outflows. In contrast, the physical
characteristics of R-127-1 and M-161-1 are puzzling, given their isolated
nature. We interpret this dichotomy in the gaseous properties of field UDGs as
a sign of the existence of multiple mechanisms for their formation, with the
formation of the quiescent gas-poor UDGs remaining a mystery.

conormal homology, defined in terms of faces and incidences and whose cycles
correspond geometrically to corner's cycles. Its Euler characteristic (over the
rationals, dimension of the total even space minus the dimension of the total
odd space), $\chi_{cn}:=\chi_0-\chi_1$, is given by the alternated sum of the
number of (open) faces of a given codimension. The main result of the present
paper is that for a compact connected manifold with corners $X$ given as a
finite product of manifolds with corners of codimension less or equal to three
we have that
  1) If $X$ satisfies the Fredholm Perturbation property (every elliptic
pseudodifferential b-operator on $X$ can be perturbed by a b-regularizing
operator so it becomes Fredholm) then the even Euler corner character of $X$
vanishes, i.e. $\chi_0(X)=0$.
  2) If the even Periodic conormal homology group vanishes, i.e.
$H_0^{pcn}(X)=0$, then $X$ satisfies the stably homotopic Fredholm Perturbation
property (i.e. every elliptic pseudodifferential b-operator on $X$ satisfies
the same named property up to stable homotopy among elliptic operators).
  3) If $H_0^{pcn}(X)$ is torsion free and if the even Euler corner character
of $X$ vanishes, i.e. $\chi_0(X)=0$ then $X$ satisfies the stably homotopic
Fredholm Perturbation property. For example for every finite product of
manifolds with corners of codimension at most two the conormal homology groups
are torsion free.
  The main theorem behind the above result is the explicit computation in terms
of conormal homology of the $K-$theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{K}_b(X)$
of $b$-compact operators for $X$ as above. Our computation unifies the only
general cases covered before, for codimension zero (smooth manifolds) and for
codimension 1 (smooth manifolds with boundary).

the well-posedness of mild solutions of the stochastic hyperbolic-parabolic

cut-off technique. Then, under suitable conditions, we prove that there is a
limit process in which the fast varying process is averaged out and the limit
process which takes the form of the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation is an

associated with an independent scale parameter --- and are thus termed
anisotropic-scale junctions (ASJs). We then apply the newly detected ASJs for
the matching of indoor images, in which there may be dramatic changes in
viewpoint and the detected local visual features, e.g., key-points, are usually
insufficiently distinctive. We propose to use the anisotropic geometries of our
junctions to improve the matching precision for indoor images. Matching results
obtained on sets of indoor images demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in indoor image matching.

problems using Bayesian inference. When the probability density of the noise
and the prior are Gaussian, the solution of such a statistical inverse problem
is also Gaussian. Therefore, the underlying solution is characterized by the
mean and covariance matrix of the posterior probability density. However, the
covariance matrix of the posterior probability density is full and large.
Hence, the computation of such a matrix is impossible for large dimensional
parameter spaces. It is shown that for many ill-posed problems, the Hessian
matrix of the data misfit part has low numerical rank and it is therefore
possible to perform a low-rank approach to approximate the posterior covariance
matrix. For such a low-rank approximation, one needs to solve a forward partial
differential equation (PDE) and the adjoint PDE in both space and time. This in
turn gives $\mathcal{O}(n_x n_t)$ complexity for both, computation and storage,
where $n_x$ is the dimension of the spatial domain and $n_t$ is the dimension
of the time domain. Such computations and storage demand are infeasible for
large problems. To overcome this obstacle, we develop a new approach that
utilizes a recently developed low-rank in time algorithm together with the
low-rank Hessian method. We reduce both the computational complexity and
storage requirement from $\mathcal{O}(n_x n_t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n_x + n_t)$. We
use numerical experiments to illustrate the advantages of our approach.

of communication between agents of the system. Moreover, for mechanism design,
the stability of Nash equilibrium (NE) is demonstrated by showing convergence

dynamics. In this paper we consider two common resource allocation problems:
sharing $ K $ infinitely divisible resources among strategic agents for their
private consumption (private goods), and determining the level for an
infinitely divisible public good with $ P $ features, that is shared between
strategic agents. For both cases, we present a distributed mechanism for a set

agents' messages are not broadcast to all other agents as in the standard
mechanism design framework, but are exchanged only in the local neighborhood of
each agent. The presented mechanisms produce a unique NE and fully implement
the social welfare maximizing allocation. In addition, the mechanisms are
budget-balanced at NE. It is also shown that the mechanisms induce a game with
contractive best-response, leading to guaranteed convergence for all learning

global optimisation and decision problems. Their performance often depends on
good search order heuristics, refined over decades of algorithms research.
Parallel search necessarily deviates from the sequential search order,
sometimes dramatically and unpredictably, e.g. by distributing work at random.
This can disrupt effective search order heuristics and lead to unexpected and
highly variable parallel performance. The variability makes it hard to reason
about the parallel performance of combinatorial searches.
  This paper presents a generic parallel branch and bound skeleton, implemented
in Haskell, with replicable parallel performance. The skeleton aims to preserve
the search order heuristic by distributing work in an ordered fashion, closely
following the sequential search order. We demonstrate the generality of the
approach by applying the skeleton to 40 instances of three combinatorial
problems: Maximum Clique, 0/1 Knapsack and Travelling Salesperson. The
overheads of our Haskell skeleton are reasonable: giving slowdown factors of
between 1.9 and 6.2 compared with a class-leading, dedicated, and highly
optimised C++ Maximum Clique solver. We demonstrate scaling up to 200 cores of
a Beowulf cluster, achieving speedups of 100x for several Maximum Clique
instances. We demonstrate low variance of parallel performance across all
instances of the three combinatorial problems and at all scales up to 200
cores, with median Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) below 2%. Parallel solvers
that do not follow the sequential search order exhibit far higher variance,
with median RSD exceeding 85% for Knapsack.

states which did not exhibit crystallization in rather long MD runs. This
observation is unusual because usually liquids formed by particles of only one
type rather readily crystallize on supercooling. At a different value of the
density we observed crystallization of the liquid into a state formed by chains
(or lines) of particles which organize themselves into columns in such a way
that each column is formed by seven lines of particles. Alternatively, one can
think that each such column is formed by three alternating helical coils. In
our view, it is possible that the overall structure that crystallizes from the
liquid at this density is quasicrystalline. If it is indeed the case, then this
observation is unusual because, as far as we understand, it is not expected, at

action of magnetospheric processes, with gas in the inner disk being channeled
onto the star's surface by the stellar magnetic field lines. Young stars are
known to accrete material in a time-variable manner and the source of this
variability remains an open problem, particularly on the shortest (~ day)
timescales. Using one-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations that
follow the field line geometry, we find that for plausibly realistic young
stars, steady-state transonic accretion occurs naturally in the absence of any
other source of variability. However, we show that if the density in the inner
disk varies smoothly in time with ~ day long time-scales (e.g., due to
turbulence) this complication can lead to the development of shocks in the
accretion column. These shocks propagate along the accretion column and
ultimately hit the star, leading to rapid, large amplitude changes in the
accretion rate. We argue that when these shocks hit the star the observed
time-dependence will be a rapid increase in accretion luminosity followed by a
slower decline and could be an explanation for some of the short period
variability observed in accreting young stars. Our one-dimensional approach
bridges previous analytic work to more complicated, multi-dimensional
simulations, and observations.

stable states which can be used to store and remember state information. The

FFs are the basic building blocks of sequential logic circuits, as logic gates
AND,OR, NOT are the basic building block for combinational logic circuits, and
are therefore necessary for any computations involving memory. Consequently,
the design and implementation of FFs can be considered as a pre-requisite for
memory machine design. Here we present the design of an optical FFs in an
atomic multi-level system, based on the optical manipulation of populations and
coherences using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We first demonstrate that
both populations and coherences can be transferred over multistate systems. We
then propose the design of toggle-FFs, Delay-FFs, and Serial-in Serial-Out
(SISO) shift registers using such systems. For the design of the filp-flops we
use a three level $\Lambda$-type system. In order to design SISO shift
registers we concatenate two $\Lambda$-type systems and construct an ""M""-type
scheme, and similarly concatenating three $\Lambda$-type system we are able to
obtain a seven level system. By concatenating we are able to use output of one
three level $\Lambda$-type system serve as input of another three level
$\Lambda$-type system. On top of using populations for design of logic gates,
we uniquely exploit the coherences for logic machine, which provides an
additional degree of freedom which can be used for the design of computing

threefold: A thorough analysis finds additional fine-structure corrections

a scalar-mediated photon-photon interaction, which now constrains the scalar's

previously possible with atomic precision tests. Our updated constraints are
$\log_{10}\beta_m \lesssim 13.4$ and $\log_{10}\beta_\gamma \lesssim 19.0$ for
the matter and photon coupling, respectively, although these remain
uncompetitive with bounds from other experiments. Second, we include the
effects of the nuclear magnetic moment, allowing for the study of hyperfine

control of electron behaviour, but is hindered by the requirement to maintain
ballistic transport over large length scales. Recent experiments have overcome
this obstacle and observed distinct magnetoresistance commensurability peaks
for perforated graphene sheets (antidot lattices). Interpreting the exact
mechanisms behind these peaks is of key importance, particularly in graphene
where a range of regimes are accessible by varying the electron density. In
this work a fully atomistic, device-based simulation of magnetoresistance
experiments allows us to analyse both the resistance peaks and the current flow

excellent agreement with experiment, but we show that a semi-classical
analysis, in terms of simple skipping or pinned orbits, is insufficient to
fully describe the corresponding electron trajectories. Instead, a generalised
mechanism in terms of states bound to individual antidots, or to groups of
antidots, is required. Commensurability features are shown to arise when
scattering between such states is enhanced. The emergence and suppression of
commensurability peaks is explored for different antidot sizes, magnetic field
strengths and electron densities. The insights gained from our study will guide

find a stopping time $\tau$ so that $W_\tau$ is distributed according to a
prescribed probability distribution $\mu$. Many solutions have been proposed
during the past 50 years and applications in different fields emerged. This
article deals with a generalized Skorokhod embedding problem (SEP): Let $X$ be
a Markov process with initial marginal distribution $\mu_0$ and let $\mu_1$ be
a probability measure. The task is to find a stopping time $\tau$ such that
$X_\tau$ is distributed according to $\mu_1$. More precisely, we study the
question of deciding if a finite mean solution to the SEP can exist for given
$\mu_0, \mu_1$ and the task of giving a solution which is as explicit as
possible. If $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$ have positive densities $h_0$ and $h_1$ and
the generator $\mathcal A$ of $X$ has a formal adjoint operator $\mathcal A^*$,
then we propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an
embedding in terms of the Poisson equation $\mathcal A^* H=h_1-h_0$ and give a
fairly explicit construction of the stopping time using the solution of the
Poisson equation. For the class of L\'evy processes we carry out the procedure
and extend a result of Bertoin and Le Jan to L\'evy processes without local
times.

fields. As an entanglement measure we compute numerically the concurrence of
two flux qubits coupled inductively and/or capacitively, both driven by a dc+ac
magnetic flux. Also we find an analytical lower bound for the concurrence,
where the dominant terms correspond to the concurrence in the Floquet states.
  We show that it is possible to create or destroy entanglement in a controlled
way by tuning the system at or near multiphoton resonances. We find that when
the driving term of the Hamiltonian does not commute with the qubit-qubit
interaction term, the control of the entanglement induced by the driving field
is more robust in parameter space. This implies that capacitively coupled two
flux qubits are more convenient for controlling entanglement through ac driving
fluxes.

the integrated radio spectrum exceeds the Mach number derived from the X-ray

for a model that is consistent with the majority of observations of this galaxy
cluster. We first show that in the northern shock upstream X-ray temperature
and radio data are consistent with each other. We then derive progenitor masses
for the system using standard density profiles, X-ray properties and the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. We find a class of models that is
roughly consistent with weak lensing data, radio data and some of the X-ray

approach for solving parametrized partial differential equations. One critical
stage of the \textit{offline} portion of the algorithm is a greedy algorithm,
requiring maximization of an error estimate over parameter space. In practice
this maximization is usually performed by replacing the parameter domain
continuum with a discrete ""training"" set. When the dimension of parameter space
is large, it is necessary to significantly increase the size of this training
set in order to effectively search parameter space. Large training sets
diminish the attractiveness of RBM algorithms since this proportionally
increases the cost of the offline {phase}.
  In this work we propose novel strategies for offline RBM algorithms that
mitigate the computational difficulty of maximizing error estimates over a
training set. The main idea is to identify a subset of the training set, a
""surrogate parameter domain"" (SPD), on which to perform greedy algorithms. The
SPD's we construct are much smaller in size than the full training set, yet our
examples suggest that they are accurate enough to represent the solution
manifold of interest at the current offline RBM iteration. We propose two
algorithms to construct the SPD: Our first algorithm, the Successive
Maximization Method (SMM) method, is inspired by inverse transform sampling for
non-standard univariate probability distributions. The second constructs an SPD
by identifying pivots in the Cholesky Decomposition of an approximate error
correlation matrix. We demonstrate the algorithm through numerical experiments,
showing that the algorithm is capable of accelerating offline RBM procedures
without degrading accuracy, assuming that the solution manifold has low
Kolmogorov width.

model to the case when the confining rock pressure, which closes a hydraulic
fracture, varies in the direction of its propagation. The extension is impelled
by the need to simulate fracture hampering (acceleration) when it penetrates
into a layer with increased (decreased) rock pressure. The paper presents the
problem formulation, an efficient numerical method for its solving, examples of
fractures propagating through layers with various stresses and general
conclusions. It is established that when the fracture enters a layer with
increased rock stresses (positive stress contrast), it actually stops. In this
case, the fluid particle velocity drops practically to zero and the velocity
near the tip oscillates about a small value until the fluid pressure increases
to the level of the increased rock pressure. In the opposite case, when the
fracture enters a layer with decreased stresses (negative stress contrast), the
fracture front accelerates until the fluid pressure drops to the level of the
decreased rock pressure. Physical considerations and numerical results imply
that the transition through a boundary of layers with different stresses may be
characterized by a simple dimensionless parameter. The latter is defined as the
ratio of the average difference between the fluid and rock pressures (at the
moment of reaching the contact) to the stress jump at the contact. The
parameter is applicable to contacts with positive as well as negative
contrasts. The model and the method developed are to serve for improvement of
the popular pseudo three-dimensional (P3D) model.

the geometric field becomes order-parameter dependent, therefore the
superconductor's order parameter dynamics affects the curvature of space-time

Sun. The latter is essentially accomplished via two toroidal structures
presumably formed in the tachocline and placed symmetrically with respect to
the equatorial plane. The two tori are characterized by several prominent
key-properties as follows: First, in each ""Torus"" a surplus charge is entrapped
for the time period of an 11-year sunspot cycle; for the next cycle the charge
changes sign. Second, the net charge of Torus, moving with the solar rotational
speed (U), generates a huge toroidal current which, in turn, builds up an
intense poloidal magnetic field. Third, each Torus is placed at a specific
distance from the Radiative Zone, so that the U of an entrapped charge carrier
equals the local propagation velocity for an electromagnetic disturbance (v).
Thus, two Torus electrons satisfy the condition that the repulsive
electrostatic force equals the attractive magnetic force caused from the two
elementary currents. Fourth, the surplus charge steadily increases; electrons
are systematically attracted inwards or repealed outwards via the poloidal
field. The charges remain without any ""Debye shielding"" action in the
Torus-core region, while they demonstrate a ""Debye anti-shielding effect""
closer to the Radiative Zone. Thus, the Torus charge ""moves"" with zero
resistivity and rotational speed U; the Torus core region behaves like a
gigantic superconductor at the extremely high temperatures of tachocline.
Fifth, the tori move equatorward drifting on a surface being an ellipsoid by
revolution on which the condition U=v is satisfied. Moreover, we present a
preliminary 3D solar circuit with the ability to reverse the magnetic field in
each 22-year cycle. Finally, we discuss many longstanding unresolved questions

called Set Matching. A matching set consists of a set of nodes (the markers), a
set of possible winning lines (the groups), and a coverage set indicating how

than two markers per group. As such it is able to prove positions in k-in-a-Row
