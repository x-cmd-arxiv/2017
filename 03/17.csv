batteries is necessary to ensure reliable system operation and to minimise
maintenance costs. The complex nature of battery degradation has meant that
mechanistic modelling of capacity fade has thus far remained intractable;
however, with the advent of cloud-connected devices, data from cells in various
applications is becoming increasingly available, and the feasibility of
data-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose
Gaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and
highlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic
approaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian non-parametric method, and hence can
model complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior
information can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean
functions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation
model is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit
correlations between data from different cells. We demonstrate the predictive
capability of GPs for short-term and long-term (remaining useful life)
forecasting on a selection of capacity vs. cycle datasets from lithium-ion
cells.

theory is applicable to the description of human decision making. The
applicability of quantum rules for describing decision making is connected with
the nontrivial process of making decisions in the case of composite prospects
under uncertainty. Such a process involves deliberations of a decision maker
when making a choice. In addition to the evaluation of the utilities of
considered prospects, real decision makers also appreciate their respective
attractiveness. Therefore, human choice is not based solely on the utility of
prospects, but includes the necessity of resolving the utility-attraction
duality. In order to justify that human consciousness really functions
similarly to the rules of quantum theory, we develop an approach defining human
behavioral probabilities as the probabilities determined by quantum rules. We
show that quantum behavioral probabilities of humans not merely explain
qualitatively how human decisions are made, but they predict quantitative

traditional work that uses equivalent currents defined on surfaces, recent

employing generalized Debye sources (GDS) as unknowns. In a complementary
effort, some of us developed a method that exploits the same representation for
both the geometry (subdivision surface representations) and functions defined
on the geometry, also known as isogeometric analysis (IGA). The challenge in
generalizing GDS method to a discretized geometry is the complexity of the
intermediate operators. However, thanks to our earlier work on subdivision
surfaces, the additional smoothness of geometric representation permits
discretizing these intermediate operations. In this paper, we employ both ideas
to present a well conditioned GDS-EFIE. Here, the intermediate surface
Laplacian is well discretized by using subdivision basis. Likewise, using
subdivision basis to represent the sources, results in an efficient and
accurate IGA framework. Numerous results are presented to demonstrate the

presented in this paper. The direct solver for aerodynamic analysis solves the
Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, where the effect of the
turbine rotor is modeled as momentum sources using the actuator disk model
(ADM); this approach is referred to as RANS/ADM. The inverse problem is posed
as follows: for a given selection of airfoils, the objective is to find the
blade geometry (described as blade twist and chord distributions) which
realizes the desired turbine aerodynamic performance at the design point; the
desired performance is prescribed as angle of attack ($\alpha$) and axial
induction factor ($a$) distributions along the blade. An iterative approach is
used. An initial estimate of blade geometry is used with the direct solver
(RANS/ADM) to obtain $\alpha$ and $a$. The differences between the calculated
and desired values of $\alpha$ and $a$ are computed and a new estimate for the
blade geometry (chord and twist) is obtained via nonlinear least squares
regression using the Trust-Region-Reflective (TRF) method. This procedure is
continued until the difference between the calculated and the desired values is
within acceptable tolerance. The method is demonstrated for conventional,
single-rotor HAWTs and then extended to multi-rotor, specifically dual-rotor
wind turbines. The TRF method is also compared with the multi-dimensional
Newton iteration method and found to provide better convergence when
constraints are imposed in blade design, although faster convergence is
obtained with the Newton method for unconstrained optimization.

possible candidate to explain coronal heating. While this scenario is supported
by observations of ubiquitous oscillations in the corona carrying sufficient
wave energy and by theoretical models that have described the concentration of
energy in small scale structures, it is still unclear whether this wave energy
can maintain the million degree solar corona. The aim of this work is to assess
how much energy can be converted by a phase-mixing process triggered by the
propagation of Alfv\'enic waves in a cylindric coronal structure, such as a
coronal loop, and to estimate the impact on the coronal heating. To this end,
we run 3D MHD simulations of a magnetised cylinder where the Alfv\'en speed
varies through a boundary shell and a footpoint driver is set to trigger kink
modes which mode couple to torsional Alfv\'en modes in the boundary shell.
These Alfv\'en waves are expected to phase-mix and the system allows us to
study the subsequent thermal energy deposition. We run a reference simulation
to explain the main process and then we vary simulation parameters. When we
take into consideration high values of magnetic resistivity and strong
footpoint drivers, we find i) that phase-mixing leads to a temperature increase
of the order of $10^5$ K or less, depending on the structure of the boundary
shell, ii) that this energy is able to balance the radiative losses only in the
localised region involved in the heating, iii) and how the boundary layer and
the persistence of the driver influence the thermal structure of the system.
Our conclusion is that due to the extreme physical parameters we adopted and
the moderate impact on the heating of the system, it is unlikely that
phase-mixing can contribute on a global scale to the heating of the solar
corona.

electron sources with a certain polarization. This polarization corresponds to
pseudospin for graphene and to real spin for topological insulators. Both for a
point source and for injection into a sample through a narrow lead, we find
that polarization leads to spatial symmetry breaking. For the Green's function,
this results in a vertical displacement, or even complete vanishing of the main
focus, depending on the exact polarization. For injection through a lead, it
leads to a difference between the amounts of current emitted with positive and
negative transversal momenta. We study both systems in detail using the
semiclassical approximation. By comparing the results to the exact solutions,
we establish that semiclassical methods provide a very effective way to study
these systems. For the Green's function, we derive an easy-to-use analytical
formula for the vertical displacement of the main focus. For current injection
through a lead, we use semiclassical methods to identify two different

choice of a stochastic model for the underlying asset price dynamics. Given

However, the model for the underlying asset price process is typically based on

set of possible estimated models by a nonparametric neighborhood of a baseline

optimization problem under model uncertainty. We obtain distributionally robust

various fields including physics and biology. In this connection, we here show
that the trade-off between attractive and repulsive couplings can induce
spontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system of coupled oscillators.
With a simple model of a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, we
demonstrate how the tendency of attractive coupling in inducing in-phase
synchronized (IPS) oscillations and the tendency of repulsive coupling in
inducing out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) oscillations compete with each other
and give rise to symmetry breaking oscillatory (SBO) states and interesting
multistabilities. Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and
anti-synchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death
(OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter
(${\lambda}$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\omega$) of the system,
the attractive coupling favours the emergence of an anti-symmetric OD state via
a Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favours the emergence of a
similar state through a saddle-node bifurcation. We show that an increase in
the repulsive coupling not only destabilizes the IPS state but also facilitates
the re-entrance of the IPS state.

aggregating deeply learnt hierarchical representations across bag members
through a dedicated MI pool layer. For better trainability and retrieval
quality, we propose a two-pronged approach that includes robust optimization
and training with an auxiliary single instance hashing arm which is
down-regulated gradually. We pose retrieval for tumor assessment as an MI
problem because tumors often coexist with benign masses and could exhibit
complementary signatures when scanned from different anatomical views.
Experimental validations on benchmark mammography and histology datasets
demonstrate improved retrieval performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

range between 0$-$0.875 using a fully charge self-consistent implementation of
the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT)
method. In particular, we compute the electronic structure and phase stability
of the rock-salt B1-structured (Fe,Mg)O at high pressures relevant for the
Earth's lower mantle. We obtain that upon compression paramagnetic (Fe,Mg)O
exhibits a spin-state transition of Fe$^{2+}$ ions from a high-spin to low-spin
(HS-LS) state which is accompanied by a collapse of local magnetic moments. The
HS-LS transition results in a substantial drop of the lattice volume by about
4$-$8 %, implying a complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of
freedom. Our results reveal a strong sensitivity of the calculated transition
pressure $P_{\rm tr.}$ upon addition of Mg. While for Fe-rich
magnesiow\""ustite, Mg $x < 0.5$, $P_{\rm tr.}$ exhibits a rather weak variation
at $\sim$80 GPa, for Fe-poor (Fe,Mg)O it drops, e.g., by about 35 % to 52 GPa
for Mg $x=0.75$. This behavior is accompanied by a substantial change of the
spin transition range from 50$-$140 GPa in FeO to 30$-$90 GPa for $x=0.75$. In
addition, the calculated bulk modulus (in the HS state) is found to increase by
$\sim$12 % from 142 GPa in FeO to 159 GPa in (Fe,Mg)O with Mg $x=0.875$. We
find that the pressure-induced HS-LS transition has different consequences for
the electronic properties of the Fe-rich and poor (Fe,Mg)O. For the Fe-rich
(Fe,Mg)O, the transition is found to be accompanied by a Mott insulator to
(semi-) metal phase transition. In contrast to that, for $x>0.25$, (Fe,Mg)O
remains insulating up to the highest studied pressures, implying a Mott
insulator to band insulator phase transition at the HS-LS transformation.

found based on the photometric properties of the brightest stars, coupled with
the apparent absence of pre-main sequence stars in the lower regions of the
CMD. The luminosity function of stars between 50 and 70 arcsec from the cluster
center is consistent with a Chabrier lognormal mass function. However, at radii
smaller than 50 arcsec there is a higher specific frequency of the most massive
main sequence stars than at larger radii. Photometry obtained from archival
SPITZER images reveals that some of the brightest stars near NGC 3105 have
excess infrared emission, presumably from warm dust envelopes. Halpha emission
is detected in a few early-type stars in and around the cluster, building upon
previous spectroscopic observations that found Be stars near NGC 3105. The
equivalent width of the NaD lines in the spectra of early type stars is
consistent with the reddening found from comparisons with isochrones. Stars
with i'~18.5 that fall near the cluster main sequence have a spectral-type A5V,

reaches one of the four face-centred equilibrium positions, however they are
vertically aligned with the axis of symmetry in the spanwise direction. In
addition, the lateral trajectories of spheres and oblates collapse into an
equilibrium manifold before ending at the equilibrium positions, with the
equilibrium manifold tangential to lines of constant background shear for both
sphere and oblate particles. The differences between the migration of the
oblate and sphere are also presented, in particular the oblate may focus on the
diagonal symmetry line of the duct cross-section, close to one of the corners,
if its diameter is larger than a certain threshold. Moreover, we show that the
final orientation and rotation of the oblate exhibit a chaotic behaviour for
Reynolds numbers beyond a critical value. Finally, we document that the lateral
motion of the oblate particle is less uniform than that of the spherical
particle due to its evident tumbling motion throughout the migration. In a
square duct, the strong tumbling motion of the oblate in the first stage of the
migration results in a lower lateral velocity and consequently longer focusing
length with respect to that of the spherical particle. The opposite is true in
a rectangular duct where the higher lateral velocity of the oblate in the
second stage of the migration, with negligible tumbling, gives rise to shorter
focusing lengths. These results can help the design of microfluidic systems for
bio-applications.

step in the heavy-ion fusion reaction mechanism but can be hindered by orders
of magnitude by quasifission, a process in which the dinuclear system breaks
apart prior to full equilibration. To provide a complete description of
heavy-ion fusion it is important to characterize the quasifission process. In
particular, the impact of changing the neutron-richness of the quasifission
process is not well known. A previous study of Cr + W reactions at a constant
13 % above the Coulomb barrier concluded that an increase in neutron-richness
leads to a decrease in the prominence of the quasifission reaction channel.
Purpose: The interplay between the fusion-fission and quasifission reaction
channels, with varying neutron-richness, was explored at a constant excitation
energy, closer to the interaction barrier than the previous work, to see if the
correlation between neutron-richness and quasifission is valid at lower
energies. Methods: Mass distributions were determined for eight different
combinations of Cr + W reactions at the Australian National University at 52.0
MeV of excitation energy in the compound nucleus. Results: A curvature
parameter was determined for the fission-like fragment mass distributions and
compared to various reaction parameters known to influence quasifission.
Conclusions: The present work demonstrates that at energies near the
interaction barrier the deformation effects dominate over the neutron-richness
effects in the competition between quasifission and compound nucleus formation
in these Cr + W systems and is an important consideration for future with heavy
and superheavy element production reactions.

increasing the sensitivity of the searches for models with heavy gluinos, for
which squark production is flavor-blind. If squarks are discovered at the LHC,
this variable can help discriminate between different underlying models. In
particular, with improved charm tagging, the charm fraction can provide
information on the gluino mass, and in some scenarios, on whether this mass is
within the reach of a future 100 TeV hadron collider.

rotating disk. Accurate estimates of this parameter are of the utmost
importance because it is directly linked to disk stability and star formation.
A global measure of the gas velocity dispersion can be inferred from the width
of the atomic hydrogen HI 21 cm line. We explore how several systematic effects
involved in the production of HI cubes affect the estimate of HI velocity
dispersion. We do so by comparing the HI velocity dispersion derived from
different types of data cubes provided by The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS).
We find that residual-scaled cubes best recover the HI velocity dispersion,
independent of the weighting scheme used and for a large range of
signal-to-noise ratio. For HI observations where the dirty beam is
substantially different from a Gaussian, the velocity dispersion values are
overestimated unless the cubes are cleaned close to (e.g., ~1.5 times) the
noise level.

in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals, combined with their rich
electronic and optical properties, would open up new possibilities for
magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications. However, in 2D
systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly hampered by thermal
fluctuations which may be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy, according to the
Mermin-Wagner theorem. Prior efforts via defect and composition engineering,
and proximity effect only locally or extrinsically introduce magnetic
responses. Here we report the first experimental discovery of intrinsic
long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers by scanning
magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In such a 2D vdW soft ferromagnet, for the first
time, an unprecedented control of transition temperature of ~ 35% - 57%
enhancement is realized via surprisingly small fields (<= 0.3 Tesla in this
work), in stark contrast to the stiffness of the transition temperature to
magnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small
applied field enables an effective anisotropy far surpassing the tiny
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a sizable spin wave excitation gap.
Confirmed by renormalized spin wave theory, we explain the phenomenon and
conclude that the unusual field dependence of transition temperature
constitutes a hallmark of 2D soft ferromagnetic vdW crystals. Our discovery of
2D soft ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 presents a close-to-ideal 2D Heisenberg
ferromagnet for studying fundamental spin behaviors, and opens the door for
exploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.

disperser moving diffusively, feeding on fruits and transporting the seeds,
which are later deposited and capable of germination. The dynamics depends on
several population parameters of growth, decay, harvesting, transport,
digestion and germination. In particular, the deposition of transported seeds
at places away from their collection sites produces a delay in the dynamics,
whose effects are the focus of this work. Analytical and numerical solutions of
different simplified scenarios show the existence of travelling waves. The
effect of zoochory is apparent in the increase of the velocity of these waves.
The results support the hypothesis of the relevance of animal mediated seed
dispersion when trying to understand the origin of the high rates of vegetable

to include X-ray binaries in which the accretor is a white dwarf, neutron star,
or black hole. We present a novel idea for detecting planets bound to such mass
transfer binaries: we propose that the X-ray light curves of these binaries be
inspected for signatures of transiting planets. X-ray transits may be the only
way to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary
approach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated
with X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of
allowable separations and find that orbital periods can be hours or longer,
while transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius
planets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider
orbits. The search for planets around mass transfer binaries could begin at
once with existing X-ray observations of these systems. If and when a planet is
detected around an X-ray binary, the size and mass of the planet may be readily
measured, and it may also be possible to study the transmission and absorption
of X-rays through its atmosphere. Finally, a noteworthy application of our
proposal is that the same technique could be used to search for signals from
extraterrestrial intelligence. If an advanced exocivilization placed a Dyson
sphere or similar structure in orbit around the accretor of an X-ray binary in
order to capture energy, such an artificial structure might cause detectable
transits in the X-ray light curve.

steady model. However, the 1-D model has not been tested to reproduce both the
volume-integrated spectrum and the radial profile of the surface brightness,
simultaneously. We revisit the 1-D steady model and apply it to PWNe 3C 58 and
G21.5-0.9. We find that the parameters of the pulsar wind, the radius of the
termination shock $r_{\rm s}$ and magnetization $\sigma$, greatly affect both
the photon spectrum and radial profile of the emission. We have shown that the
parameters constrained by the entire spectrum lead to a smaller X-ray nebula
than observed one. We have also tested the case that reproduces only the
observations in X and gamma-rays, ignoring the radio and optical components. In
this case, there are parameter sets that reproduce both the spectrum and
emission profile, but the advection time to the edge of the nebula becomes much
smaller than the age. Our detailed discussion clarifies that the standard 1-D
steady model has severe difficulty to reproduce both the volume-integrated
spectrum and the surface brightness simultaneously. This implies that the model
should be improved by taking into account extra physical processes such as
spatial diffusion of particles. Additionally, we calculate the surface
brightness profile of the radio, optical and TeV gamma-rays. The future
observations in these wavelengths are also important to probe the spatial

(cSFG) at z=2.225, 3D-HST GS30274. As is typical for cSFGs, this galaxy has a
stellar mass of $1.89 \pm 0.47\,\times 10^{11}\,\rm{M}_\odot$, with a star
formation rate of $214\pm44\,\rm{M}_\odot\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ putting it on the
star-forming `main-sequence', but with an H-band effective radius of 2.5 kpc,
making it much smaller than the bulk of `main-sequence' star-forming galaxies.
The intensity ratio of the line detections yield an ISM density (~ 6 $\times
10^{4}\,\rm{cm}^{-3}$) and a UV-radiation field ( ~2 $\times 10^4\,\rm{G}_0$),
similar to the values in local starburst and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy
environments. A starburst phase is consistent with the short depletion times
($t_{\rm H2, dep} \leq 140$ Myr) we find using three different proxies for the
H2 mass ([CI], CO, dust mass). This depletion time is significantly shorter
than in more extended SFGs with similar stellar masses and SFRs. Moreover, the
gas fraction of 3D-HST GS30274 is smaller than typically found in extended
galaxies. We measure the CO and [CI] kinematics and find a FWHM line width of
~$750 \pm 41 $ km s$^{-1}$. The CO and [CI] FWHM are consistent with a
previously measured H$\alpha$ FWHM for this source. The line widths are
consistent with gravitational motions, suggesting we are seeing a compact
molecular gas reservoir. A previous merger event, as suggested by the
asymmetric light profile, may be responsible for the compact distribution of
gas and has triggered a central starburst event. This event gives rise to the
starburst-like ISM properties and short depletion times. The centrally located
and efficient star formation is quickly building up a dense core of stars,
responsible for the compact distribution of stellar light in 3D-HST GS30274.

on dust to launch galactic outflows and (2) to constrain the efficiency of
infrared (IR) multi-scattering in boosting outflow acceleration. Our
simulations are performed with the radiation-hydrodynamic code RAMSES-RT and
include both single- and multi-scattered radiation pressure from an AGN,
radiative cooling and self-gravity. Since outflowing shells always eventually
become transparent to the incident radiation field, outflows that sweep up all
intervening gas are likely to remain gravitationally bound to their halo even
at high AGN luminosities. The expansion of outflowing shells is well described
by simple analytic models as long as the shells are mildly optically thick to
IR radiation. In this case, an enhancement in the acceleration of shells
through IR multi-scattering occurs as predicted, i.e. a force dP/dt = tau_IR
L/c is exerted on the gas. For high optical depths tau_IR > 50, however,
momentum transfer between outflowing optically thick gas and IR radiation is
rapidly suppressed, even if the radiation is efficiently confined. At high
tau_IR, the characteristic flow time becomes shorter than the required trapping
time of IR radiation such that the momentum flux dP/dt << tau_IR L/c. We argue
that while unlikely to unbind massive galactic gaseous haloes, AGN radiation
pressure on dust could play an important role in regulating star formation and
black hole accretion in the nuclei of massive compact galaxies at high
redshift.

unprecedented 6D phase space information of satellite galaxies. Such
measurements can shed light on the structure and assembly history of the Local
Group, but improved statistical methods are needed to use them efficiently.
Here we illustrate such a method using analogs of the Local Group's two most
massive satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Triangulum
(M33), from the Illustris dark-matter-only cosmological simulation. We use a
Bayesian inference scheme combining measurements of positions, velocities, and
specific orbital angular momenta ( j ) of the LMC/M33 with importance sampling
of their simulated analogs to compute posterior estimates of the Milky Way (MW)
and Andromeda's (M31) halo masses. We conclude the resulting host halo mass is
more susceptible to bias when using measurements of the current position and
velocity of satellites, especially when satellites are at short-lived phases of
their orbits (i.e. at pericentre). Instead, the j value of a satellite is
well-conserved over time and provides a more reliable constraint on host mass.
The inferred virial mass of the MW (M31) using j of the LMC (M33) is $\rm
M_{vir, MW}=1.02^{+0.77}_{-0.55}\times10^{12}\; M_{\odot}$ ($\rm M_{vir,
M31}=1.37^{+1.39}_{-0.75}\times10^{12}\; M_{\odot}$). Choosing simulated
analogs whose j values are consistent with the conventional picture of a
previous (< 3 Gyr ago), close encounter (< 100 kpc) of M33 about M31 results in
a very low virial mass for M31 ($\rm\sim\!10^{12}\; M_{\odot}$). This supports
the new scenario put forth in Patel et al. (2017), wherein M33 is on its first
passage about M31 or on a long period orbit. We conclude that this Bayesian
inference scheme, utilising satellite j, is a promising method to reduce the
current factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW and M31 moving
forward.

of $4-11\times10^{44}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. The inferred total IR energy is
$1-2\times10^{52}$\,erg, suggesting a large dust covering factor. Finally, our
dust model suggests that the long tail of the optical flare could be due to
dust scattering.

Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space

distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and
photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise
individual masses spanning 30-115 $M_{\rm Jup}$. We determine a
model-independent substellar boundary that is $\approx$70 $M_{\rm Jup}$ in mass
($\approx$L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. (2015)
evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 $M_{\rm

substellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only
the Saumon & Marley (2008) ""hybrid"" models accounting for cloud clearing match
our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective
temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct
determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and
30-70 $M_{\rm Jup}$. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population
synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star
formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We
discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured
masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully
considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are
significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries,
possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks.
Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) is proposed. DM-VAD is required in
many signal processing applications, e.g. distributed speech enhancement based
on multi-channel Wiener filtering, but is non-existent up to date. The proposed
method neither requires a fusion center nor prior knowledge about the node
positions, microphone array orientations or the number of observed sources. It
consists of two steps: (i) distributed source-specific energy signal unmixing
(ii) energy signal based voice activity detection. Existing computationally
efficient methods to extract source-specific energy signals from the mixed
observations, e.g., multiplicative non-negative independent component analysis
(MNICA) quickly loose performance with an increasing number of sources, and
require a fusion center. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
distributed energy signal unmixing method based on a source-specific node
clustering method to locate the nodes around each source. To determine the
number of sources that are observed in the WASN, a source enumeration method
that uses a Lasso penalized Poisson generalized linear model is developed. Each
identified cluster estimates the energy signal of a single (dominant) source by
applying a two-component MNICA. The VAD problem is transformed into a
clustering task, by extracting features from the energy signals and applying
K-means type clustering algorithms. All steps of the proposed method are
evaluated using numerical experiments. A VAD accuracy of $> 85 \%$ is achieved
for a challenging scenario where 20 nodes observe 7 sources in a simulated
reverberant rectangular room.

\rightarrow \{-1, 1\}$ is the least degree of a real polynomial that
approximates $f$ pointwise to error at most $1/3$. We introduce a generic
method for increasing the approximate degree of a given function, while
preserving its computability by constant-depth circuits.
  Specifically, we show how to transform any Boolean function $f$ with
approximate degree $d$ into a function $F$ on $O(n \cdot
\operatorname{polylog}(n))$ variables with approximate degree at least $D =
\Omega(n^{1/3} \cdot d^{2/3})$. In particular, if $d= n^{1-\Omega(1)}$, then
$D$ is polynomially larger than $d$. Moreover, if $f$ is computed by a
polynomial-size Boolean circuit of constant depth, then so is $F$.
  By recursively applying our transformation, for any constant $\delta > 0$ we
exhibit an AC$^0$ function of approximate degree $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$. This
improves over the best previous lower bound of $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ due to
Aaronson and Shi (J. ACM 2004), and nearly matches the trivial upper bound of
$n$ that holds for any function. Our lower bounds also apply to
(quasipolynomial-size) DNFs of polylogarithmic width.
  We describe several applications of these results. We give:
  * For any constant $\delta > 0$, an $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ lower bound on the
quantum communication complexity of a function in AC$^0$.
  * A Boolean function $f$ with approximate degree at least $C(f)^{2-o(1)}$,
where $C(f)$ is the certificate complexity of $f$. This separation is optimal
up to the $o(1)$ term in the exponent.
  * Improved secret sharing schemes with reconstruction procedures in AC$^0$.

critical task in the hyperspectral unmixing process. The accuracy of this
estimate plays a crucial role in subsequent unsupervised unmixing steps i.e.,
the derivation of the spectral signatures of the endmembers (endmembers'
extraction) and the estimation of the abundance fractions of the pixels. A
common practice amply followed in literature is to treat endmembers' number
estimation and unmixing, independently as two separate tasks, providing the
outcome of the former as input to the latter. In this paper, we go beyond this
computationally demanding strategy. More precisely, we set forth a multiple
constrained optimization framework, which encapsulates endmembers' number
estimation and unsupervised unmixing in a single task. This is attained by
suitably formulating the problem via a low-rank and sparse nonnegative matrix
factorization rationale, where low-rankness is promoted with the use of a
sophisticated $\ell_2/\ell_1$ norm penalty term. An alternating proximal
algorithm is then proposed for minimizing the emerging cost function. The
results obtained by simulated and real data experiments verify the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

diagrams, even if squarks and gluinos are much heavier than 1 TeV. The rare
decays $K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ are
similarly sensitive to very high mass scales and the first one also measures CP
violation. In this article, we analyze the correlations between
$\epsilon^{\prime}_K/\epsilon_K$ and $B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})$ and $B(K^+
\to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ within the MSSM aiming at an explanation of
$\epsilon_K^{\prime}/\epsilon_K$ via gluino-squark box diagrams. The dominant
MSSM contribution to the $K \to \pi\nu\bar{\nu}$ branching fractions stems from
box diagrams with squarks, sleptons, charginos, and neutralinos, and the
pattern of the correlations is different from the widely studied $Z$-penguin
scenarios. This is interesting in light of future precision measurements by
KOTO and NA62 at J-PARC and CERN, respectively. We find $B(K_L \to
\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})/B^{SM} (K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})\lesssim 2\,(1.2)$ and
$B(K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu})/B^{SM}(K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}) \lesssim
1.4\,(1.1)$, if all squark masses are above 1.5 TeV, gaugino masses obey GUT
relations, and if one allows for a fine-tuning at the $1\%\,(10\%)$ level for
the gluino mass. Larger values are possible for a tuned CP violating phase.
Furthermore, the sign of the MSSM contribution to $\epsilon_K^{\prime}$ imposes
a strict correlation between $B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})$ and the hierarchy
between the masses $m_{\bar{U}}$, $m_{\bar{D}}$ of the right-handed up-squark
and down-squark: sgn$[B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})-B^{SM} (K_L \to

shown that the nonzero driving force is a result of the dependence of the ion
mean free path on the particle number density. If this effect is properly
included in the model of similar complex plasmas then one arrives at the
driving force that changes its sign at the point where the probe and the dust

the driving force is directed toward the discharge center and vice versa, in

measured on the same set of samples from different views (i.e., multi-view
data). For example, in genetic studies, multiple genomic data sets at different
molecular levels or from different cell types are measured for a common set of
individuals to investigate genetic regulation. Integration and reduction of
multi-view data have the potential to leverage information in different data
sets, and to reduce the magnitude and complexity of data for further
statistical analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we develop a novel
statistical model, called supervised integrated factor analysis (SIFA), for
integrative dimension reduction of multi-view data while incorporating
auxiliary covariates. The model decomposes data into joint and individual
factors, capturing the joint variation across multiple data sets and the
individual variation specific to each set respectively. Moreover, both joint
and individual factors are partially informed by auxiliary covariates via
nonparametric models. We devise a computationally efficient
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the model under some
identifiability conditions. We apply the method to the Genotype-Tissue
Expression (GTEx) data, and provide new insights into the variation
decomposition of gene expression in multiple tissues. Extensive simulation
studies and an additional application to a pediatric growth study demonstrate
the advantage of the proposed method over competing methods.

higher-order terms in the hydrodynamic limit of our lattice Boltzmann method.
We identify these corrections to fourth order and validate these predictions
with high accuracy. However, it is observed that the validated correction terms
do not fully explain the bulk of observed error. This error was instead caused
by the standard finite boundary conditions for the contact of the coating with
the imposed environment. We identify a self-consistent form of these boundary
conditions for which these errors are dramatically reduced. The instantaneous
switching used as a boundary condition for the barrier problem proves demanding
enough that any higher-order corrections meaningfully contribute for a small

with a massive black hole (MBH). We consider binaries on highly eccentric
orbits around the MBH that change due to random gravitational interactions with
other stars in the nuclear stellar cluster. The pericenters of the orbits
perform a random walk, and we consider cases where this random walk slowly
brings the binary to the Hills tidal separation radius (the so-called empty
loss-cone regime). However, we find that in a majority of cases the expected
separation does not occur and instead the members of the binary merge together.
This happens because the binary's eccentricity is excited by tidal interactions
with the MBH, and the relative excursions of the internal eccentricity of the
binary far exceed those in its internal semimajor axis. This frequently reduces
the pericenter separation to values below typical stellar diameters, which
induces a significant fraction of such binaries to merge ($\gtrsim 75\%$ in our
set of numerical experiments). Stellar tides do not appreciably change the
total rate of mergers but circularise binaries, leading to a significant
fraction of low-eccentricity, low-impact-velocity mergers. Some of the stellar
merger products will then be tidally disrupted by the MBH within $\sim 10^6$
years. If the merger strongly enhances the magnetic field of the merger
product, this process could explain observations of prompt relativistic jet
formation in some tidal disruption events.

produces perfect samples without any previous knowledge of the mixing time of a
quantum Markov chain. To implement it, we assume we are able to perform the
phase estimation algorithm for the underlying Hamiltonian and implement a
quantum Markov chain such that the transition probabilities between eigenstates
only depend on their energy. We provide some examples of quantum Markov chains
that satisfy these conditions and analyze the expected run-time of the
algorithm, which depends strongly on the degeneracy of the underlying

as it is polylogarithmic in the dimension and linear in the mixing time. For
non-degenerate spectra, its runtime is essentially the same as its classical
counterpart, which is linear in the mixing time and quadratic in the dimension,
up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension. We analyze the circuit depth
necessary to implement it, which is proportional to the sum of the depth
necessary to implement one step of the quantum Markov chain and one phase
estimation. This algorithm is stable under noise in the implementation of
different steps. We also briefly discuss how to adapt different `Coupling from

simulating the evolution of SADs within this framework. That is, SADs are
conceived as voided (subdense) cavities formed by non-linear waves triggered by
downflowing bursty localized reconnection events in a perturbed hot fan. We
generate a properly turbulent fan, obtained by a stirring force that permits
control of the energy and vorticity input in the medium where SADs develop. We
include anisotropic thermal conduction and consider plasma properties
consistent with observations. Our aim is to study if it is possible to prevent
SADs to vanish by thermal diffusion. We find that this will be the case,
depending on the turbulence parameters. In particular, if the magnetic field
lines are able to envelope the voided cavities, thermally isolating them from
the hot environment. Velocity shear perturbations that are able to generate
instabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type help to produce magnetic islands,

equivalent to the KV problem. G. Massuyeau constructed such expansions using
the Kontsevich integral.
  In order to prove this result, we show that the Turaev cobracket $\delta$ can
be constructed in terms of the double bracket (upgrading the Goldman bracket)
and the non-commutative divergence cocycle which plays the central role in the
KV theory. Among other things, this observation gives a new topological
interpretation of the KV problem and allows to extend it to surfaces with
arbitrary number of boundary components (and of arbitrary genus, see [C. R.

problem. The Stefan problem represents a liquid-solid phase transition as time
evolution of a temperature profile in a liquid-solid material and its moving
interface. This physical process is mathematically formulated as a diffusion
partial differential equation (PDE) evolving on a time-varying spatial domain
described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The state-dependency of
the moving interface makes the coupled PDE-ODE system a nonlinear and
challenging problem. We propose a full-state feedback control law, an observer
design, and the associated output-feedback control law via the backstepping
method. The designed observer allows estimation of the temperature profile
based on the available measurement of solid phase length. The associated
output-feedback controller ensures the global exponential stability of the
estimation errors, the H1- norm of the distributed temperature, and the moving
interface to the desired setpoint under some explicitly given restrictions on
the setpoint and observer gain. The exponential stability results are
established considering Neumann and Dirichlet boundary actuations.

We assume ocean-covered worlds, with atmospheres comprised of N2, CO2, and H2O,
and with orbital and geophysical properties defined from observation. Model
results indicate that the inner three planets (b, c, and d) presently reside
interior to the inner edge of the traditional liquid water habitable zone. Thus
if water ever existed on the inner planets, they would have undergone a runaway
greenhouse and lost their water to space, leaving them dry today. Conversely
the outer 3 planets (f, g, and h) fall beyond the maximum CO2 greenhouse outer
edge of the habitable zone. Model results indicate that the outer planets
cannot be warmed despite as much as 30 bar CO2 atmospheres, instead entering a
snowball state. The middle planet (e) represents the best chance for a
presently habitable ocean-covered world in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Planet e can
maintain at least some habitable surface area with 0 - 2 bar CO2, depending on
the background N2 content. Near present day Earth surface temperatures can be
maintained for an ocean-covered planet e with either 1 bar N2 and 0.4 bar CO2,

multiplex network structure of the data and exploits the dual nature of the
network in terms of nodes and layers. The proposed centrality of the layers
(influences) and the centrality of the nodes are determined by a coupled set of
equations. The basic idea consists in assigning more centrality to nodes that
receive links from highly influential layers and from already central nodes.
The layers are more influential if highly central nodes are active in them. The
algorithm applies to directed/undirected as well as to weighted/unweighted

displays (OST-HMDs) across medical, industrial and entertainment settings, many
systems with different capabilities are rapidly entering the market. Despite
such variety, they all require display calibration to create a proper mixed
reality environment. With the aid of tracking systems, it is possible to
register rendered graphics with tracked objects in the real world. We propose a
calibration procedure to properly align the coordinate system of a 3D virtual
scene that the user sees with that of the tracker. Our method takes a blackbox
approach towards the HMD calibration, where the tracker's data is its input and
the 3D coordinates of a virtual object in the observer's eye is the output; the
objective is thus to find the 3D projection that aligns the virtual content
with its real counterpart. In addition, a faster and more intuitive version of
this calibration is introduced in which the user simultaneously aligns multiple
points of a single virtual 3D object with its real counterpart; this reduces
the number of required repetitions in the alignment from 20 to only 4, which
leads to a much easier calibration task for the user. In this paper, both
internal (HMD camera) and external tracking systems are studied. We perform
experiments with Microsoft HoloLens, taking advantage of its self localization
and spatial mapping capabilities to eliminate the requirement for line of sight
from the HMD to the object or external tracker. The experimental results
indicate an accuracy of up to 4 mm in the average reprojection error based on
two separate evaluation methods. We further perform experiments with the
internal tracking on the Epson Moverio BT-300 to demonstrate that the method
can provide similar results with other HMDs.

the precise nature and origin of this co-evolution is not clear. We here
explore the possible connection between star formation and black hole growth in
the circumnuclear disk (CND) to probe this connection in the vicinity close to
the black hole. We adopt here the circumnuclear disk model developed by
Kawakatu & Wada (2008) and Wutschik et al. (2013), and explore both the
dependence on the star formation recipe as well as the role of the
gravitational field, which can be dominated by the central black hole, the CND
itself or the host galaxy. A specific emphasis is put on the turbulence
regulated star formation model by Krumholz et al. (2005) to explore the impact
of a realistic star formation recipe. It is shown that this model helps to
introduce realistic fluctuations in the black hole and star formation rate,
without overestimating them. Consistent with previous works, we show that the
final black hole masses are rather insensitive to the masses of the initial
seeds, even for seed masses of up to 10^6 M_sol. In addition, we apply our
model to the formation of high-redshift quasars, as well as to the nearby
system NGC 6951, where a tentative comparison is made in spite of the presence
of a bar in the galaxy. We show that our model can reproduce the high black
hole masses of the high-redshift quasars within a sufficiently short time,
provided a high mass supply rate from the host galaxy. In addition, it
reproduces several of the properties observed in NGC 6951. With respect to the
latter system, our analysis suggests that supernova feedback may be important
to create the observed fluctuations in the star formation history as a result
of negative feedback effects.

The abundance of elements such as Mg, Fe, and Ba in metal-poor stars help us
understand the metal mixing in galaxies. However, the efficiency of metal
mixing in galaxies is not yet understood. Here we report a series of
$N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of dwarf galaxies with
different efficiencies of metal mixing using turbulence-induced mixing model.
We show that metal mixing apparently occurs in dwarf galaxies from Mg and Ba
abundance. We find that the scaling factor for metal diffusion larger than 0.01
is necessary to reproduce the observation of Ba abundance in dwarf galaxies.
This value is consistent with the value expected from turbulence theory and
experiment. We also find that timescale of metal mixing is less than 40 Myr.
This timescale is shorter than that of typical dynamical times of dwarf
galaxies. We demonstrate that the determination of a degree of scatters of Ba
abundance by the observation will help us to constrain the efficiency of metal
mixing more precisely.

coupled plasma from Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ($\sqrt{s}=2.76\text{TeV}$). The
azimuthal correlations are compared with those from perturbative QCD based
simulations. When restricted to leading order production processes, we find
that the strongly coupled correlations of high transverse momentum pairs
($>4\text{GeV}$) are broadened less efficiently than the corresponding weak
coupling based correlations, while low transverse momentum pairs (1-4GeV) are
broadened with similar efficiency, but with an order of magnitude more
particles ending up in this momentum class.
  The strong coupling momentum correlations we compute account for initial
correlations and reveal that the particle pairs suppressed from initially high
momenta to the low momentum domain do not suffice to explain the stark
difference to the weak coupling results in momentum correlations for 1-4GeV.

the dressing method and Hirota method. The dressing method allows us to derive
two types of soliton solutions. The first type corresponds to a set of 6
symmetrically situated discrete eigenvalues of the Lax operator $L$; to each
soliton of the second type one relates a set of 12 discrete eigenvalues of $L$.
We also outline how one can construct general $N$ soliton solution containing
$N_1$ solitons of first type and $N_2$ solitons of second type, $N=N_1+N_2$.
The possible singularities of the solitons and the effects of change of
variables that relate the different members of Tzitzeica family equations are
briefly discussed. All equations allow quasi-regular as well as singular
soliton solutions.

that uses radio frequency (RF) wireless energy transfer (WET) technology to
power the information transmissions of wireless devices (WDs). When energy and
information are transferred in the same frequency band, a major design issue is
transmission scheduling to avoid interference and achieve high communication
performance. Commonly used centralized scheduling methods in WPCN may result in
high control signaling overhead and thus are not suitable for wireless networks
constituting a large number of WDs with random locations and dynamic
operations. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a distributed
scheduling protocol for energy and information transmissions in WPCN.
Specifically, we allow a WD that is about to deplete its battery to broadcast
an energy request buzz (ERB), which triggers WET from its associated hybrid
access point (HAP) to recharge the battery. If no ERB is sent, the WDs contend
to transmit data to the HAP using the conventional $p$-persistent CSMA (carrier
sensing multiple access). In particular, we propose an energy queueing model
based on an energy decoupling property to derive the throughput performance.
Our analysis is verified through simulations under practical network
parameters, which demonstrate good throughput performance of the distributed
scheduling protocol and reveal some interesting design insights that are
different from conventional contention-based communication network assuming the
WDs are powered with unlimited energy supplies.

simulation (DNS) dataset of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence to determine
probability distribution functions (PDFs) for cascade multipliers, which
determine the ratio by which a property is partitioned into sub-volumes as an

collapse when scaled with an appropriately defined local Stokes number. As

one-dimensional (1D) bulk geometry, our model allows ($\alpha$, $\beta$) to
vary from (2,3) for the non-relativistic model in traditional solids to (3/2,2)
for the ultra-relativistic model of massless Dirac fermions. For a
two-dimensional (2D) thin-film geometry, we obtain $\alpha = \beta$ that varies
between 2 and 3/2, respectively, at the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic
limits. We further provide a rigorous proof based on a Green's function
approach that for uniform SCLC model described by carrier density-dependent
mobility, the scaling relations of the 1D bulk model can be directly mapped
into the case of 2D thin film for any contact geometries. Our simplified
approach provides a convenient tool to obtain the 2D thin-film SCLC scaling
relations without the need of explicitly solving the complicated 2D problems.
Finally, this work clarifies the inconsistency in using the traditional SCLC

quantum clock to a quantum memory of the smallest possible size. Our method
could be used to measure the total duration of a sequence of events with
enhanced accuracy, and to reduce the amount of quantum communication needed to
stabilize clocks in a quantum network.

the phenomenological inclusion of perturbations covering most of the thermal
atom experiments. A possible extension to the many-body case is briefly
discussed. The Ramsey pulses are assumed to have variable durations and the
detuning during the pulses is distinguished from the detuning during evolution.
Consequently, the pulses are not restricted to resonant operation and give more
flexibility to optimize the interferometer to particular experimental
conditions. On this basis another model is devised in which the contrast loss
due to the unequal one-body population decays is cancelled by the application
of a non-standard splitting pulse. For the importance of its practical
implications, an analogous spin-echo model is also provided. The developed
models are suitable for the analysis of atomic clocks and a broad range of
sensing applications, they are particularly useful for trapped-atom
interferometers.

simple trackers such as correlation filters outperform complex methods based on
deep networks. This suggests that for practical applications (such as in
robotics or embedded vision), one needs to carefully tradeoff bandwidth
constraints associated with higher frame rate acquisition, computational costs
of real-time analysis, and the required application accuracy. Our dataset and

result from the periodic generation of double layers due to the modulation of
the densities of positive and negative ions responding to the externally
applied RF potential. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the formation of
striations is given, as well as the effect of the driving frequency on the
plasma parameters, such as the spatially modulated charged species densities,
the electric field, and the electron power absorption is studied by PROES
measurements, PIC/MCC simulations, and an ion-ion plasma model. The measured
spatio-temporal electronic excitation patterns at different driving frequencies
show a high degree of consistency with the simulation results. The striation
gap (i.e., the distance between two ion density maxima) is found to be
inversely proportional to the driving frequency. In the presence of striations
the minimum(CF_3^+, F^-) ion densities in the bulk region exhibit an
approximately quadratic increase with the driving frequency. For these
densities, the eigenfrequency of the ion-ion plasma is near the driving
frequency, indicating that a resonance occurs between the positive and negative
ions and the oscillating electric field inside the plasma bulk. The maximum ion
densities in the plasma bulk are found not to exhibit a simple dependence on
the driving frequency, since these ion densities are abnormally enhanced within
a certain frequency range due to the ions being focused into the ""striations""

observed from two ground-based surveys and from \textit{Spitzer}. The
\textit{Spitzer} data exhibit finite-source effects due to the passage of the
lens close to or directly over the surface of the source star as seen from
\textit{Spitzer}. Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of
the angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax
derived from a comparison between the ground-based and the \textit{Spitzer}
light curves, yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax. From this
analysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star
with the mass $0.10 \pm 0.02 \ M_\odot$ or a brown dwarf with the mass $55\pm 9
\ M_{J}$, which are respectively located at $D_{\rm LS} = 0.80 \pm 0.19\
\textrm{kpc}$ and $ D_{\rm LS} = 0.54 \pm 0.08\ \textrm{kpc}$, and thus it is
the first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the
Galactic bulge. The fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the
finite-source effect is seen only in a single data point from \textit{Spitzer}
and this single data point gives rise to two solutions for $\rho$. Because the
$\rho$ degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high cadence observations
around the peak, while the \textit{Spitzer} cadence is typically $\sim 1\,{\rm
day}^{-1}$, we expect that events for which the finite-source effect is seen
only in the \textit{Spitzer} data may frequently exhibit this $\rho$
degeneracy. For OGLE-2015-BLG-1482, the relative proper motion of the lens and
source for the low-mass star is $\mu_{\rm rel} = 9.0 \pm 1.9\ \textrm{mas
yr$^{-1}$}$, while for the brown dwarf it is $5.5 \pm 0.5\ \textrm{mas
yr$^{-1}$}$. Hence, the degeneracy can be resolved within $\sim 10\ \rm yrs$
from direct lens imaging by using next-generation instruments with high spatial
resolution.

(2D) materials has grown to encompass a broad range of electronic properties.
Recent additions include spin-valley coupled semiconductors, Ising
superconductors that can be tuned into a quantum metal, possible Mott
insulators with tunable charge-density waves, and topological semi-metals with
edge transport. Despite this progress, there is still no 2D crystal with
intrinsic magnetism, which would be useful for many technologies such as
sensing, information, and data storage. Theoretically, magnetic order is
prohibited in the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the
Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction
and enables, for instance, the occurrence of 2D Ising ferromagnetism. Here, we
use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer
chromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin
orientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 K is only slightly lower than the 61 K
of the bulk crystal, consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our
studies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase transition, showcasing the
hallmark thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals
crystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a
metamagnetic effect, while in trilayer the interlayer ferromagnetism observed
in the bulk crystal is restored. Our work creates opportunities for studying
magnetism by harnessing the unique features of atomically-thin materials, such
as electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics, and van der Waals

1998, etc.), extreme weather events pose an enormous threat to the electric
power transmission systems and the associated socio-economic systems that
depend on reliable delivery of electric power. Besides inevitable malfunction
of power grid components, deliberate malicious attacks can cause high risks to
the service. These threats motivate the need for approaches and methods that
improve the resilience of power systems. In this paper, we develop a model and
tractable methods for optimizing the upgrade of transmission systems through a
combination of hardening existing components, adding redundant lines, switches,
generators, and FACTS and phase-shifting devices. While many of these
controllable components are included in traditional design (expansion planning)
problems, we uniquely assess their benefits from a resiliency point of view.
More importantly, perhaps, we evaluate the suitability of using
state-of-the-art AC power flow relaxations versus the common DC approximation
in resilience improvement studies. The resiliency model and algorithms are
tested on a modified version of the RTS-96 (single area) system.

dual-frequency radio observations. Single-dish observations of S5 0716+714 were
simultaneously conducted at 21.7 GHz (K-band) and 42.4 GHz (Q-band), with a
high cadence of 30-60 minute intervals.We observed four epochs between December
2009 and June 2010. Over the whole set of observation epochs, S5 0716+714
showed significant inter-month variations in flux density at both the K- and
Q-bands, with modulation indices of approximately 19% for the K-band and
approximately 36% for the Q-band. In all epochs, no clear intraday variability
was detected at either frequency. The source shows monotonic flux density
increase in epochs 1 and 3 and monotonic flux density decrease in epochs 2 and
4. In the flux density increasing phases, the flux densities at the Q-band
increase more rapidly. In the decreasing phase, no significant flux density
difference is seen at the two frequencies. The situation could be different
close to flux density peaks that we did not witness in our observations. We
find an inverted spectrum with mean spectral indices of -0.57+-0.13 in epoch 1
and -0.15+-0.11 in epoch 3. On the other hand, we find relatively steep indices
of +0.24+-0.14 and +0.17+-0.18 in epochs 2 and 4, respectively. We conclude
that the frequency dependence of the variability and the change of the spectral
index are caused by source-intrinsic effects rather than by any extrinsic
scintillation effect.

batteries have been at the forefront of sensing and communication technologies
in the last few years. Sensor networks with different missions are being
massively rolled out, particularly in the internet-of-things commercial market.
To ensure sustainable operation of WRSNs, charging in a timely fashion is very
important, since lack of energy of even a single sensor node could result in
serious outcomes. With the large number of WRSNs existing and to be existed,
energy-efficient charging schemes are becoming indispensable to workplaces that
demand a proper level of operating cost. Selection of charging scheme depends
on network parameters such as the distribution pattern of sensor nodes, the
mobility of the charger, and the availability of the directional antenna. Among
current charging techniques, radio frequency (RF) remote charging with a small
transmit antenna is gaining interest when non-contact type charging is required
for sensor nodes. RF charging is particularly useful when sensor nodes are
distributed in the service area. To obtain higher charging efficiency with RF
charging, optimal path planning for mobile chargers, and the beamforming
technique, implemented by making use of a directional antenna, can be
considered. In this article, we present a review of RF charging for WRSNs from
the perspectives of charging by mobile charger, harvesting using sensor nodes,
and energy trading between sensor nodes. The concept of a pivot cluster head is
introduced and a novel RF charging scheme in two stages, consisting of charging
pivot cluster heads by a mobile charger with a directional antenna and charging
member sensor nodes by pivot cluster heads with directional antennae, is
presented.

in a way that entails equalizing confounders across racial groups, which may

$p$ (or $\infty$ if such an integer does not exist) such that for each $x\in X$
there exist $k\le p+1$ subcontinua $$X=N_0\supset N_1\supset
N_2\supset\cdots\supset N_{k}=\{x\}$$ such that $N_{i}$ is a fiber of $N_{i-1}$
for $1\le i\le k$. If $X\subset\mathbb{C}$ is an unshielded continuum or a
continuum whose complement has finitely many components, we obtain that local
connectedness of $X$ is equivalent to the statement $\ell^*(X)=0$.
  We discuss the relation of our concepts to the works of Schleicher (1999) and
Kiwi (2004). We further define an equivalence relation $\sim$ based on the
fibers and show that the quotient space $X/\sim$ is a locally connected
continuum. For connected Julia sets of polynomials and more generally for
unshielded continua, we obtain that every prime end impression is contained in
a fiber. Finally, we apply our results to examples from the literature and
construct for each $n\ge1$ concrete examples of path connected continua $X_n$
with $\ell^*(X_n)=n$.

transition brought about by onset of the capacity for self-triggered recall and
rehearsal. Here we develop a novel idea that models of collectively
autocatalytic networks, developed for understanding the origin and organization
of life, may also help explain the origin of the kind of cognitive structure
that makes cultural evolution possible. In our setting, mental representations
(for example, memories, concepts, ideas) play the role of 'molecules', and
'reactions' involve the evoking of one representation by another through
remindings, associations, and stimuli. In the 'episodic mind', representations
are so coarse-grained (encode too few properties) that such reactions are
catalyzed only by external stimuli. As cranial capacity increased,
representations became more fine-grained (encoded more features), allowing them
to act as catalysts, leading to streams of thought. At this point, the mind
could combine representations and adapt them to specific needs and situations,
and thereby contribute to cultural evolution. In this paper, we propose and
study a simple and explicit cognitive model that gives rise naturally to
autocatylatic networks, and thereby provides a possible mechanism for the
transition from a pre-cultural episodic mind to a mimetic mind.

Empirical Bayes approach or on simple before and after comparisons. Issues of

approach combines propensity score (PS) and OR models to give an average

this approach within a novel approximate Bayesian framework to derive posterior

multiphase processes which make its comprehension and model capabilities still

within a turbulent spatial developing jet in dilute, non-reacting conditions.
We address the problem using a Direct Numerical Simulation of jet laden with
acetone droplets using an hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian approach based on the
point droplet approximation. A detailed statistical analysis of both phases is
presented. In particular, we show how crucial is the preferential sampling of
the vapour phase induced by the inhomogeneous localization of the droplets
through the flow. The preferential segregation of droplets develops suddenly
downstream the inlet both within the turbulent core and in the mixing layer.
Two distinct mechanisms have been found to drive these phenomena, the inertial
small-scale clustering in the jet core and the intermittent dynamics of
droplets across the turbulent/non-turbulent interface in the mixing layer where
dry air entrainment occurs. These phenomenologies strongly affect the overall
vaporization process and lead to a spectacular widening of droplets size and
vaporization rate distributions in the downstream evolution of the turbulent
spray.

ultra-high energy cosmic-ray experiments and neutrino telescopes have fuelled a
renewed interest in hadronic emission models for gamma-loud blazars. We explore
physically plausible solutions for a lepto-hadronic interpretation of the
stationary emission from high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs). The
modelled spectral energy distributions are then searched for specific
signatures at very high energies that could help to distinguish the hadronic
origin of the emission from a standard leptonic scenario. By introducing a few
basic constraints on parameters of the model, such as assuming the
co-acceleration of electrons and protons, we significantly reduced the number
of free parameters. We then systematically explored the parameter space of the
size of the emission region and its magnetic field for two bright gamma-loud
HBLs, PKS 2155-304 and Mrk 421. For all solutions close to equipartition
between the energy densities of protons and of the magnetic field, and with
acceptable jet power and light-crossing timescales, we inspected the spectral
hardening in the multi-TeV domain from proton-photon induced cascades and
muon-synchrotron emission inside the source. Very-high-energy spectra simulated
with the available instrument functions from the future Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) were evaluated for detectable features as a function of exposure
time, source redshift, and flux level. Over a large range of model parameters,
the spectral hardening due to internal synchrotron-pair cascades, the ""cascade
bump"", should be detectable for acceptable exposure times with the future CTA
for a few nearby and bright HBLs.

attachment models in which the birth rates are linear functions. We are
motivated by citation networks, where power-law citation counts are observed as
well as aging in the citation patterns. To model this, we introduce fitness and
age-dependence in these birth processes. The multiplicative fitness moderates
the rate at which children are born, while the aging is integrable, so that
individuals receives a finite number of children in their lifetime. We show the
existence of a limiting degree distribution for such processes. In the
preferential attachment case, where fitness and aging are absent, this limiting
degree distribution is known to have power-law tails. We show that the limiting
degree distribution has exponential tails for bounded fitnesses in the presence
of integrable aging, while the power-law tail is restored when integrable aging
is combined with fitness with unbounded support with at most exponential tails.
In the absence of integrable aging, such processes are explosive.

respectively M and N antennas and IC operates in a time division duplex mode.
In the first proposed algorithm, each transceiver adjusts its filter to
maximize the expected value of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).
On the other hand, the second algorithm tries to minimize the variances of the
SINRs to hedge against the variability due to CSI error. Taylor expansion is
exploited to approximate the effect of CSI imperfection on mean and variance.
The proposed robust algorithms utilize the reciprocity of wireless networks to
optimize the estimated statistical properties in two different working modes.

experimentally and theoretically address this question for a prototypical spin

driving we realize a dipolar XY spin-1/2 model in an external field. Starting
from a spin-polarized state we suddenly switch on the external field and
monitor the subsequent many-body dynamics. Our key observation is density
dependent relaxation of the total magnetization much faster than typical

employ different theoretical approaches which treat quantum effects on initial

intrinsically quantum component to the relaxation attributed to primordial

as a discussion on the quantifications of discordance when comparing the

However, as a by-product, we present an update to the similar analysis in
(Battye, Charnock and Moss; 2015) where we find that, considering new data and
treatment of priors, the constraints from the CMB and from a combination of LSS
probes are in greater agreement and any tension only persists to a minor
degree. In particular, we find the parameter constraints from the combination
of LSS probes which are most discrepant with the Planck2015+Pol+BAO parameter

growing power sources, focusing on early supermassive black holes (BHs). We
assumed that these objects grow to $10^9\;M_{\odot}$ by z=6 by
Eddington-limited accretion and convert 5% of their bolometric output into a
wind. We first considered the case of energy-driven and momentum-driven
outflows expanding in a region where the gas and total mass densities are
uniform and equal to the average values in the Universe at $z>6$. We derived
analytic solutions for the evolution of the outflow, finding that, for an
exponentially growing power with e-folding time $t_{Sal}$, the late time
expansion of the outflow radius is also exponential, with e-folding time of
$5t_{Sal}$ and $4t_{Sal}$ in the energy-driven and momentum-driven limit,
respectively.
  We then considered energy-driven outflows produced by QSOs at the center of
early dark matter halos of different masses and powered by BHs growing from
different seeds. We followed the evolution of the source power and of the gas
and dark matter density profiles in the halos from the beginning of the
accretion until $z=6$. The final bubble radius and velocity do not depend on
the seed BH mass but are instead smaller for larger halo masses. At z=6, bubble
radii in the range 50-180 kpc and velocities in the range 400-1000 km s$^{-1}$
are expected for QSOs hosted by halos in the mass range
$3\times10^{11}-10^{13}\;M_{\odot}$.
  By the time the QSO is observed, we found that the total thermal energy
injected within the bubble in the case of an energy-driven outflow is
$E_{th}\sim5 \times 10^{60}$ erg. This is in excellent agreement with the value
of $E_{th}=(6.2\pm 1.7)\times 10^{60}$ erg measured through the detection of
the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect around a large population of luminous QSOs

analytic and numerical integration and show that increase of radiation entropy
leads to increasing cycle size and duration. We introduce a null energy
condition violating ghost field to create a smooth, non-singular bounce of
finite size at the end of each cycle and compute the evolution through many
cycles with and without entropy increase injected at the start of each cycle.
In the presence of increasing entropy we find that the cycles grow larger and
longer and the dynamics approach flatness, as in the isotropic case. However,
successive cycles become increasingly anisotropic at the expansion maxima which
is dominated by the general-relativistic effects of anisotropic 3-curvature.
However, it becomes positive after expansion drives the dynamics close enough
to isotropy for the curvature to become positive and for gravitational collapse
to ensue. In the presence of a positive cosmological constant, radiation and a
ghost field we show that, for a very wide range of cosmological constant
values, the growing oscillations always cease and the dynamics subsequently
approach those of the isotropic de Sitter universe at late times. This model is
not included in the scope of earlier cosmic no-hair theorems because the
3-curvature can be positive. In the case of negative cosmological constant,
radiation and an ultra-stiff field (to create non-singular bounces) we show
that a sequence of chaotic oscillations also occurs, with sensitive dependence
on initial conditions. In all cases, we follow the oscillatory evolution of the

spiral arms by modeling data drawn from an N-body simulation snapshot of a
disk-dominated galaxy of MW mass with strong spiral arms (but no bar),
exploring survey volumes with radii 500pc<=r_max<=5kpc. The potential
constraints are very robust, even though we use a simple action-based DF, the
quasi-isothermal DF (qDF). The best-fit RoadMapping model always recovers the
correct gravitational forces where most of the stars that entered the analysis
are located, even for small volumes. For data from large survey volumes,
RoadMapping finds axisymmetric models that average well over the spiral arms.
Unsurprisingly, the models are slightly biased by the excess of stars in the
spiral arms. Gravitational potential models derived from survey volumes with at
least r_max=3kpc can be reliably extrapolated to larger volumes. However, a
large radial survey extent, r_max~5kpc, is needed to correctly recover the halo
scale length. In general, the recovery and extrapolability of potentials
inferred from data sets which were drawn from inter-arm regions appear to be
better than those of data sets drawn from spiral arms. Our analysis implies
that building axisymmetric models for the Galaxy with upcoming Gaia data will
lead to sensible and robust approximations of the MW's potential.

principle to utilize the available prior knowledge from system self
configuration. To guarantee good performance when the prior knowledge is
insufficient, we incorporate the performance correlation among similar power
values, and establish an algorithm that exploits the correlation structure to
recover majority of the degraded performance. Furthermore, we explicitly
consider power switching penalties in order to discourage frequent changes of
the transmit power, which cause varying coverage and uneven user experience.
Comprehensive system-level simulations are performed for both single and
multiple SBS deployment scenarios, and the resulting power settings are
compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Significant performance gains of
the proposed algorithms are observed. Particularly, the correlation structure
enables the algorithm to converge much faster to the optimal long-term power
than other methods.

classified all relativistic B-invariant-systems in terms of strongly continuous

B(2,1) of the BMS group B in 3 space-time dimensions. B(2,1) itself admits
thirty-four analogues both real in all signatures and in complex space-times.
In order to find the IRS of both B(2,1) and its analogues we need to extend
Wigner-Mackey's theory of induced representations. The necessary extension is
described and is reduced to the solution of three problems. These problems are
solved in the case where B(2,1) and its analogues are equipped with the Hilbert
topology. The extended theory is necessary in order to construct the IRS of
both B and its analogues in any number d of space-time dimensions, d is greater

to construct the IRS of B(2,1): The main results of the representation theory
are: The IRS are induced from little groups which are compact. The finite
little groups are cyclic groups of even order. The inducing construction is
exhaustive notwithstanding the fact that B(2,1) is not locally compact in the

taken as far as is possible with current computer technology (except in special

this method we have calculated 69 new exact solutions, including 9 new

the nuclear spin polaron bound to neutral donors would form below some critical

The predicted critical behavior is a direct consequence of the use of the
mean-field approximation. It is known however that in any finite size system a
critical behavior must be absent. Here we develop a model of the optically
cooled nuclear polaron, which goes beyond the mean-field approximation. An
expression of the generalized free energy of the optically cooled nuclear
polaron, valid for a finite, albeit large, number of spins, is derived. This
model permits to describe the continuous transition from the fluctuation
dominated regime to the saturation regime, as the nuclear spin temperature
decreases. It is shown that due to the finite number of nuclear spins involved
in the polaron, the critical effects close to TC are smoothed by the spin
fluctuations. Particularly, instead of a divergence, the nuclear spin
fluctuations exhibit a sharp peak at TC, before being depressed well below TC.
Interestingly, the formation of the nuclear polaron can, in certain conditions,
boost the nuclear polarization beyond the value obtained solely by optical
pumping. Finally, we suggest that the nuclear polaron could be detected by spin
noise spectroscopy or via its superparamagnetic behavior.

interesting questions. In this paper we analyse a particular discrepancy
between non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM) and `classical' (Newtonian)
space and time (NST). We also suggest, but not discuss, the case of the
relativistic QM. In this work, we are more concerned with the notion of space
and its mathematical representation. The mathematics entails that any two
spatially separated objects are necessarily \ita{different}, which implies that
they are \ita{discernible} (in classical logic, identity is defined by means of
indiscernibility) --- we say that the space is $T_2$, or ""Hausdorff"". But when
enters QM, sometimes the systems need to be taken as \ita{completely
indistinguishable}, so that there is no way to tell which system is which, and
this holds even in the case of fermions. But in the NST setting, it seems that
we can always give an \ita{identity} to them by means of their individuation,
which seems to be contra the physical situation, where individuation
(isolation) does not entail identity (as we argue in this paper). Here we
discuss this topic by considering a case study (that of two potentially
infinite wells) and conclude that, taking into account the quantum case, that
is, when physics enter the discussion, even NST cannot be used to say that the
systems do have identity. This case study seems to be relevant for a more
detailed discussion on the interplay between physical theories (such as quantum
theory) and their underlying mathematics (and logic), in a simple way
apparently never realized before.

became popular in many applied sciences via Shannon's formula to measure the
degree of heterogeneity among observations. A rather recent research field aims
at accounting for space in entropy measures, as a generalization when the
spatial location of occurrences ought to be accounted for. The main limit of
these developments is that all indices are computed conditional on a chosen
distance. This work follows and extends the route for including spatial
components in entropy measures. Starting from the probabilistic properties of
Shannon's entropy for categorical variables, it investigates the
characteristics of the quantities known as residual entropy and mutual
information, when space is included as a second dimension. This way, the
proposal of entropy measures based on univariate distributions is extended to
the consideration of bivariate distributions, in a setting where the
probabilistic meaning of all components is well defined. As a direct
consequence, a spatial entropy measure satisfying the additivity property is
obtained, as global residual entropy is a sum of partial entropies based on
different distance classes. Moreover, the quantity known as mutual information
measures the information brought by the inclusion of space, and also has the
property of additivity. A thorough comparative study illustrates the
superiority of the proposed indices.

high-resolution N-body simulations of a disc galaxy prone to mild bar
instability. For realistic initial conditions of satellites, we take advantage
of cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like dark matter haloes. Results. The
satellites may have a significant impact on the time of bar formation. Some
runs with satellites demonstrate a delay, while others show an advancement in
bar formation compared to the isolated run, with such time differences reaching
$\sim$ 1 Gyr. Meanwhile, the final bar configuration, including its very
appearance and the bar characteristics such as the pattern speed and the
exponential growth rate of its amplitude are independent of the number of
encounters and their orbits. The contribution of satellites with masses below
$10^9 M_{\odot}$ is insignificant, unless their pericentre distances are small.
We suggest that the encounters act indirectly via inducing perturbations across
the disc that evolve to delayed waves in the central part and interfere with an
emerging seed bar. The predicted effect for the present-day host galaxy is
expected to be even more significant at redshifts $z \gtrsim 0.5$.

making these palettes appear frequently in the dataset, we employed density
estimation to capture the characteristics of palette data. Via density
estimation, we carried out various predictions and interpolations on palettes,
which led to promising applications such as photo-style exploration, real-time
color suggestion, and enriched photo recolorization. It was, however,
challenging to apply density estimation to palette data as palettes often come
as unordered sets of colors, which make it difficult to use conventional
metrics on them. To this end, we developed a divide-and-conquer sorting
algorithm to rearrange the colors in the palettes in a coherent order, which
allows meaningful interpolation between color palettes. To confirm the
performance of our model, we also conducted quantitative experiments on

simulation suite is to extend the concentration-mass relation of dark matter
halos down to masses below those typically available in large cosmological
simulations. The three different density regions available at higher resolution
provide a better understanding of the effect of the local environment on halo
concentration, known to be potentially important for small simulation boxes and
small halo masses. Yet, we find the correction to be small in comparison with
the scatter of halo concentrations. We conclude that zoom simulations, despite
their limited representativity of the volume of the Universe, can be
effectively used for the measurement of halo concentrations at least at the
halo masses probed by our simulations. In any case, after a precise
characterization of this effect, we develop a robust technique to extrapolate
the concentration values found in zoom simulations to larger volumes with
greater accuracy. All together, Lomonosov provides a measure of the

future and corresponding option contracts to test this model to evaluate its
ability of performing pricing and capturing features of the implied volatility.
To sum up, the free stochastic volatility model with asymmetric jumps is able
to adequately capture implied volatility dynamics and thus it can be seen as a
superior model relative to the fixed volatility model in pricing VIX
derivatives.

undone. This paper addresses the integration of reversible semantics into
process languages for communication-centric systems equipped with behavioral
types. In prior work, we introduced a monitors-as-memories approach to
seamlessly integrate reversible semantics into a process model in which
concurrency is governed by session types (a class of behavioral types),
covering binary (two-party) protocols with synchronous communication. The
applicability and expressiveness of the binary setting, however, is limited.
  Here we extend our approach, and use it to define reversible semantics for an
expressive process model that accounts for multiparty (n-party) protocols,
asynchronous communication, decoupled rollbacks, and abstraction passing. As
main result, we prove that our reversible semantics for multiparty protocols is
causally-consistent. A key technical ingredient in our developments is an
alternative reversible semantics with atomic rollbacks, which is conceptually
simple and is shown to characterize decoupled rollbacks.

an accurate description of the photoelectron spectra. Finally, we investigate
the effects of electron correlation on the magnitude of the relative time-delay

the ground state channel in the ion, is accessible without electron

diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online
platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that
systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or
complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an
independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this
probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing
above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are
observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding
factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network
community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we
performed on Twitter using `social bots' deployed to carry out coordinated
attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models
describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing
hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model
describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than
simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective
defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved

become more extreme. Well-known limiting models, such as max-stable or
generalized Pareto processes, cannot capture this, which can lead to a
preference for models that exhibit a property known as asymptotic independence.
However, weakening dependence does not automatically imply asymptotic
independence, and whether the process is truly asymptotically (in)dependent is
usually far from clear. The distinction is key as it can have a large impact
upon extrapolation, i.e., the estimated probabilities of events more extreme
than those observed. In this work, we present a single spatial model that is
able to capture both dependence classes in a parsimonious manner, and with a
smooth transition between the two cases. The model covers a wide range of
possibilities from asymptotic independence through to complete dependence, and
permits weakening dependence of extremes even under asymptotic dependence.
Censored likelihood-based inference for the implied copula is feasible in
moderate dimensions due to closed-form margins. The model is applied to
oceanographic datasets with ambiguous true limiting dependence structure.

bulk Reynolds number are considered. These are complemented with two reference
single-phase flows: the unladen case, and the flow of a Newtonian fluid with
the effective suspension viscosity of the same mixture in the laminar regime.
As recently highlighted in Costa et al. (PRL 117, 134501), a particle-wall
layer is responsible for deviations of the statistics from what is observed in
the continuum limit where the suspension is modeled as a Newtonian fluid with
an effective viscosity. Here we investigate the fluid and particle dynamics in
this layer and in the bulk. In the particle-wall layer, the near wall
inhomogeneity has an influence on the suspension micro-structure over a
distance proportional to the particle size. In this layer, particles have a
significant (apparent) slip velocity that is reflected in the distribution of
wall shear stresses. This is characterized by extreme events (both much higher
and much lower than the mean). Based on these observations we provide a scaling
for the particle-to-fluid apparent slip velocity as a function of the flow
parameters. We also extend the flow scaling laws in to second-order Eulerian
statistics in the homogeneous suspension region away from the wall. Finite-size
effects in the bulk of the channel become important for larger particles, while
negligible for lower-order statistics and smaller particles. Finally, we study
the particle dynamics along the wall-normal direction. Our results suggest that
1-point dispersion is dominated by particle-turbulence (and not
particle-particle) interactions, while differences in 2-point dispersion and
collisional dynamics are consistent with a picture of shear-driven

  Aims: We explain this effect in the ultraviolet LCs of the symbiotic binary

  Methods: We model the continuum fluxes in the spectra obtained by the
International Ultraviolet Explorer at 10 wavelengths, from 1280 to 3080 \AA. We
consider that the white dwarf radiation is attenuated by $H^0$ atoms, $H^-$
ions and free electrons in the red giant wind. Variation in the nebular
component is approximated by a sine wave along the orbit as suggested by
spectral energy distribution models. The model includes asymmetric wind
velocity distribution and the corresponding ionization structure of the binary.
  Results: We determined distribution of the $H^0$ and $H^+$, as well as upper
limits of $H^-$ and $H^0$ column densities in the neutral and ionized region at
the selected wavelengths as functions of the orbital phase. Corresponding
models of the LCs match well the observed continuum fluxes. In this way, we
suggested the main UV continuum absorbing (scattering) processes in the
circumbinary environment of S-type symbiotic stars.
  Conclusions: The asymmetric profile of the ultraviolet LCs of SY Mus is
caused by the asymmetric distribution of the circumstellar matter at the
near-orbital-plane area.

neural networks have diverged from their biological archetypes as they have
been remodeled to fit particular tasks. In this paper, we review several
possibilites to reverse map these architectures to biologically more realistic
spiking networks with the aim of emulating them on fast, low-power neuromorphic
hardware. Since many of these devices employ analog components, which cannot be
perfectly controlled, finding ways to compensate for the resulting effects
represents a key challenge. Here, we discuss three different strategies to
address this problem: the addition of auxiliary network components for
stabilizing activity, the utilization of inherently robust architectures and a
training method for hardware-emulated networks that functions without perfect
knowledge of the system's dynamics and parameters. For all three scenarios, we
corroborate our theoretical considerations with experimental results on
accelerated analog neuromorphic platforms.

the usual max-product algorithm finds (in any network) approximations within

high-temperature semimetallic phase, the mobilities and concentrations of both
electrons and holes conspire in such a way to create an almost
temperature-independent conductivity as well as a low Hall effect. We explain
these phenomena as a consequence of a predominantly inter-pocket scattering
which equalizes mobilities of the two types of charge carriers. At low
temperatures, within the insulating charge-ordered phase two channels of
conduction can be discerned: a temperature-dependent activation which follows
the mean-field behavior, and a nearest-neighbor hopping contribution. Together
with negative magnetoresistance, the latter relies on the presence of disorder.
The charge-ordered phase also features a prominent dielectric peak which bears
a similarity to relaxor ferroelectrics. Its dispersion is determined by
free-electron screening and pushed by disorder well below the transition
temperature. The source of this disorder can be found in the anion layers which
randomly perturb BEDT-TTF molecules through hydrogen bonds.

performing effective peer offloading faces many unique challenges in small cell

in-situ processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile
networks. Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing,
however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed
areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power
supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and
unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high
quality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems.
In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile
edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource
management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic
workload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to
minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and
operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the
(offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a
significant improvement of learning rate and run-time performance when compared
to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning. We prove the
convergence of the proposed algorithm and analytically show that the learned
policy has a simple monotone structure amenable to practical implementation.
Our simulation results validate the efficacy of our algorithm, which
significantly improves the edge computing performance compared to fixed or
myopic optimization schemes and conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.

parameters in macroscopic nucleation models. We show how the number of solid
and liquid atoms in such simulations can be determined unambiguously by using a
Gibbs dividing surface and how the free energy as a function of the number of
solid atoms in the nucleus can thus be extracted. We then show that the
parameters of a model based on classical nucleation theory can be fit using the
information contained in these free-energy profiles but that the parameters in
such models are highly correlated. This correlation is unfortunate as it
ensures that small errors in the computed free energy surface can give rise to
large errors in the extrapolated properties of the fitted model. To resolve
this problem we thus propose a method for fitting macroscopic nucleation models
that uses simulations of planar interfaces and simulations of three-dimensional
nuclei in tandem. We show that when the parameters of the macroscopic model are
fitted in this way the numerical errors for the final fitted model are smaller
and that the extrapolated predictions for large nuclei are thus more reliable.

random tools applicable to modeling of relaxation phenomena, we present
probabilistic implications for the study of the relaxation-rate distribution

consider description of complex systems, in which relaxing entities form random
clusters interacting with each other and single entities. Then we focus on
stochastic mechanisms of the relaxation phenomenon. We discuss the diffusion
approach and its usefulness for understanding of anomalous dynamics of the
relaxing systems. We also discuss extensions of the diffusive approach to the

high-quality 2D materials with attractive electronic, thermal, chemical, and
mechanical properties. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique is currently
the most reliable route to synthesis few-atomic layer thick and large-scale
TMDs films. However, the effects of grain boundaries formed during the CVD
method on the properties of TMDs nanomembranes have remained less explored. In
this study, we therefore aim to investigate the thermal conduction along
polycrystalline molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the representative member of
TMDs nanomembranes family. This goal was achieved by developing a combined
atomistic-continuum multiscale method. In the proposed approach, reactive
molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to assess thermal contact
conductance of diverse grain boundaries with various defects configurations.
The effective thermal conductivity along the CVD grown polycrystalline and
single-layer MoS2 was finally acquired by conducting finite element modelling.
Insight provided by this investigation can be useful to evaluate the effective
thermal transport along a wide variety of 2D materials and structures.

possibility of further tuning the electronic properties of MoS2 through the
fabrication of single-layer heterostructures consisting of semiconducting (2H)
and metallic (1T) MoS2 phases. Nonetheless, despite significant technological
and scientific interest, there is currently limited information concerning the
mechanical properties of these heterostructure systems. This investigation aims
to extend our understanding of the mechanical properties of all-MoS2
single-layer structures at room temperature. This goal was achieved by
performing extensive classical molecular dynamics simulations using a recently
developed RexFF forcefield. We first studied the direction dependent mechanical
properties of defect-free 2H and 1T phases. Our modelling results for pristine
2H MoS2 were found to be in good agreement with the experimental tests and
first-principles theoretical predictions. We also discuss the mechanical
response of 2H/1T single layer heterostructures. Our reactive molecular
dynamics results suggest all-MoS2 heterostructures as suitable candidates to
provide a strong and flexible material with tuneable electronic properties.

and dynamical properties of real networks, yet they fail to predict the correct
values of the exponents of power-law degree distributions observed in real
networks. In that respect, random geometric graphs in asymptotically de Sitter
spacetimes, such as the Lorentzian spacetime of our accelerating universe, are
more attractive as their predictions are more consistent with observations in
real networks. Yet another important property of hyperbolic graphs is their
navigability, and it remains unclear if de Sitter graphs are as navigable as
hyperbolic ones. Here we study the navigability of random geometric graphs in
three Lorentzian manifolds corresponding to universes filled only with dark
energy (de Sitter spacetime), only with matter, and with a mixture of dark
energy and matter as in our universe. We find that these graphs are navigable
only in the manifolds with dark energy. This result implies that, in terms of
navigability, random geometric graphs in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes
are as good as random hyperbolic graphs. It also establishes a connection
between the presence of dark energy and navigability of the discretized causal
structure of spacetime, which provides a basis for a different approach to the
dark energy problem in cosmology.

coordinate fluctuations of a laser beam propagating through isotropic optical
turbulence. The main focus here is on the characterization of the long-range
correlations in the wandering of a thin Gaussian laser beam over a screen after
propagating through a turbulent medium. To fulfill this goal, a
laboratory-controlled experiment was conducted in which coordinate fluctuations
of the laser beam were recorded at a sufficiently high sampling rate for a wide
range of turbulent conditions. Horizontal and vertical displacements of the
laser beam centroid were subsequently analyzed by implementing the symbolic
technique based on ordinal patterns to estimate the well-known permutation
entropy. We show that the permutation entropy estimations at multiple time
scales evidence an interplay between different dynamical behaviors. More
specifically, a crossover between two different scaling regimes is observed. We
confirm a transition from an integrated stochastic process contaminated with
electronic noise to a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst exponent H = 5/6
as the sampling time increases. Besides, we are able to quantify, from the
estimated entropy, the amount of electronic noise as a function of the
turbulence strength. We have also demonstrated that these experimental
observations are in very good agreement with numerical simulations of noisy
fractional Brownian motions with a well-defined crossover between two different
scaling regimes.

which epidemics is transmitted, efficient and accurate implementations of

exact prescriptions can lead to uncontrolled biases. Based on the Gillespie
algorithm (GA), in which only steps that change the state are considered, we
develop numerical recipes and describe their computer implementations for
statistically exact and computationally efficient simulations of generic
Markovian epidemic processes aiming at highly heterogeneous and large networks.
The central point of the recipes investigated here is to include phantom
processes, that do not change the states but do count for time increments. We
compare the efficiencies for the susceptible-infected-susceptible, contact
process and susceptible-infected-recovered models, that are particular cases of
a generic model considered here. We numerically confirm that the simulation
outcomes of the optimized algorithms are statistically indistinguishable from
the original GA and can be several orders of magnitude more efficient.
