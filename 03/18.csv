the light of the first LHC runs. The model is based on a $SU(4)$ gauge group
with global flavour symmetry breaking $SU(5) \to SO(5)$, giving rise to pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone bosons in addition to the Higgs doublet. This includes a real
and a complex electroweak triplet with exotic electric charges. Including
these, as well as constraints on other exotic states, we show that LHC
measurements are not yet sensitive enough to significantly constrain the
model's low energy constants. The Higgs potential is described by two
parameters which are on the one hand constrained by the LHC measurement of the
Higgs mass and Higgs decay channels and on the other hand can be computed from
correlation functions in the UV-complete theory. Hence to exclude the model at
least one constant needs to be determined and to validate the Higgs potential
both constants need to be reproduced by the UV-theory. Due to its
UV-formulation, a certain number of low energy constants can be computed from
first principle numerical simulations of the theory formulated on a lattice,
which can help in establishing the validity of this model. We assess the
potential impact of lattice calculations for phenomenological studies, as a
preliminary step towards Monte Carlo simulations.

using a combination of specifically sampled rows and columns, known as CUR
decomposition. Unfortunately, in many real-world environments, the ability to
sample specific individual rows or columns of the matrix is limited by either
system constraints or cost. In this paper, we consider matrix approximation by
sampling predefined \emph{blocks} of columns (or rows) from the matrix. We
present an algorithm for sampling useful column blocks and provide novel
guarantees for the quality of the approximation. This algorithm has application
in problems as diverse as biometric data analysis to distributed computing. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the
Block CUR decomposition of large matrices in a distributed setting with
multiple nodes in a compute cluster, where such blocks correspond to columns
(or rows) of the matrix stored on the same node, which can be retrieved with
much less overhead than retrieving individual columns stored across different
nodes. In the biometric setting, the rows correspond to different users and
columns correspond to users' biometric reaction to external stimuli, {\em
e.g.,}~watching video content, at a particular time instant. There is
significant cost in acquiring each user's reaction to lengthy content so we
sample a few important scenes to approximate the biometric response. An
individual time sample in this use case cannot be queried in isolation due to
the lack of context that caused that biometric reaction. Instead, collections
of time segments ({\em i.e.,} blocks) must be presented to the user. The
practical application of these algorithms is shown via experimental results
using real-world user biometric data from a content testing environment.

a set of PSFs observed at random locations, we want to estimate the PSFs at

propose an interpolation framework based on Sliced Optimal Transport. A
non-linear dimension reduction is first performed based on local pairwise

unknown PSFs is then estimated, which in turn is used to derive representations
of those PSFs in the Wasserstein metric. Finally, the interpolated PSFs are
calculated as approximated Wasserstein barycenters. Results: the proposed

non-DNA-binding proteins, even at low densities, exert an osmotic force which
can be a lot larger than the entropic force exerted by the compressed DNA. The
trends we observe are qualitatively robust with respect to changes in protein
size, and are similar for neutral and charged proteins (and DNA). We also
quantify the dynamics of DNA expansion following removal of the ""piston"": while
the expansion is well fitted by power laws, the apparent exponent depends on
protein concentration, and protein-DNA interaction in a significant way. We
further highlight an interesting kinetic process which we observe during the
expansion of DNA interacting with DNA-binding proteins when the interaction
strength is intermediate: the proteins bind while the DNA is packaged by the
compression force, but they ""pop-off"" one-by-one as the force is removed,
leading to a slow unzipping kinetics. Finally, we quantify the importance of
supercoiling, which is an important feature of bacterial DNA in vivo.

the temporal inhomogeneities found in human interactions, one can introduce
ageing in the agents: the probability to update decreases with the time elapsed

via coarsening in complex networks. Additionally, multilayer networks produce
profound changes in the dynamics of models. In this work, we investigate how a
multilayer structure affects the dynamics of an ageing voter model. The system
is studied as a function of the fraction of nodes sharing states across layers
(multiplexity parameter q ). We find that the dynamics of the system suffers a
notable change at an intermediate value q*. Above it, the voter model always
orders to an absorbing configuration. While, below, a fraction of the

breaking in which the majority opinion in the different layers takes opposite

all parameters of the problem have been disclosed. An important special case of
such problem especially arises in scheduling and staff rostering problems,
where a set of tasks needs to be assigned to an available set of resources
(personnel or machines), in a way that each task is assigned to one resource,
while no task is allowed to share a resource with another task. In its nominal
form, the resulting computational problem reduces to the well-known assignment
problem that can be modeled as matching problems on bipartite graphs.
  In recent work \cite{adjiashvili_bindewald_michaels_icalp2016}, a new robust
model for the assignment problem was introduced that can deal with situations
in which certain resources, i.e.\ nodes or edges of the underlying bipartite
graph, are vulnerable and may become unavailable after a solution has been
chosen. In the original version from
\cite{adjiashvili_bindewald_michaels_icalp2016} the resources subject to
uncertainty are the edges of the underlying bipartite graph.
  In this follow-up work, we complement our previous study by considering nodes
as being vulnerable, instead of edges. The goal is now to choose a minimum-cost
collection of nodes such that, if any vulnerable node becomes unavailable, the
remaining part of the solution still contains sufficient nodes to perform all
tasks. From a practical point of view, such type of unavailability is
interesting as it is typically caused e.g.\ by an employee's sickness, or
machine failure. We present algorithms and hardness of approximation results
for several variants of the problem.

consistent propensity score weighting estimator of the average treatment effect
when the propensity score and outcome follow generalized linear mixed effects
models. The proposed propensity score weighting estimator is attractive,
because it does not require specification of functional forms of the propensity
score and outcome models, and therefore is robust to model misspecification.
The proposed weighting method can be combined with sampling weights for an
integrated solution to handle confounding and sampling designs for causal
inference with clustered survey data. In simulation studies, we show that the
proposed estimator is superior to other competitors. We estimate the effect of

elastic strain distribution in an unlimited medium containing an inclusion with
a coordinate-dependent lattice mismatch (an eigenstrain). Quantum dots
consisting of a solid solution with a spatially varying composition are
examples of such inclusions. It is assumed that both the inclusion and the
surrounding medium (the matrix) are elastically isotropic and have the same
Young modulus and Poisson ratio. The inclusion shape is supposed to be an
arbitrary polyhedron, and the coordinate dependence of the lattice misfit, with
respect to the matrix, is assumed to be a polynomial of any degree. It is shown
that, both inside and outside the inclusion, the strain tensor is expressed as
a sum of contributions of all faces, edges and vertices of the inclusion. Each
of these contributions, as a function of the observation point's coordinates,
is a product of some polynomial and a simple analytical function, which is the
solid angle subtended by the face from the observation point (for a
contribution of a face), or the potential of the uniformly charged edge (for a
contribution of an edge), or the distance from the vertex to the observation
point (for a contribution of a vertex). The method of constructing the relevant
polynomial functions is suggested. We also found out that similar expressions
describe an electrostatic or gravitational potential, as well as its first and
second derivatives, of a polyhedral body with a charge/mass density that
depends on coordinates polynomially.

to find a self-approaching path inside a polygon connecting two points under a

data available for analysis in the nearby Universe, these data are valuable in
constraining cosmological evolution of either DM scenarios, or -- as I discuss
here -- $z$-dependence of MOND. Indeed, these results, if taken at face value,
teach us useful lessons in connection with MOND. a. The dynamical accelerations
at the half-light radii, found by Genzel et al., are rather high compared with
the MOND acceleration constant, as measured in the nearby Universe:
$g(R_{1/2})= (3-11)a_0$. MOND then predicts fractions of `phantom matter' at
$R_{1/2}$ of at most a few tens of percents, which, galaxy by galaxy, agree
well with what Genzel et al. find. b. The asymptotic rotational speeds
predicted by MOND from the baryonic-mass estimates of Genzel et al. are
substantially lower ($0.55-0.75$) than the maximal speeds of the RCs. MOND thus
predicts a substantial decline of the RCs beyond the maximum. This too is in
line with what Genzel et al. find. c. Arguably, the most important lesson is
that the findings of Genzel et al. cast very meaningful constraints on possible
variation of $a_0$ with cosmic time. For example, they all but exclude a value
of the MOND constant of $\sim 4a_0$ at $z\sim 2$, excluding, e.g., $a_0\propto
(1+z)^{3/2}$.

where both negative (competition) and positive (mutualism) interactions are
concurrently present. Recently, it has been shown that many ecosystems can be
cast into mutualistic networks, and that nestedness reduces effective
inter-species competition, thus facilitating mutually beneficial interactions
and increasing the number of coexisting species or the biodiversity. However,
current approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by
adopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive
interactions properly. Here, we introduce a framework based on the concept of
multilayer networks, which naturally accounts for both mutualism and
competition. Hence, we abandon the mean field hypothesis and show, through a
dynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an
intricate relation between competition and mutualism. Specifically, we show
that when all interactions are taken into account, mutualism does not have the
same consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species. This
leads to a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of
competition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous
consideration of positive and negative interactions can contribute to our
understanding of the delicate trade-offs between topology and biodiversity in
ecosystems and call for a reconsideration of previous findings in theoretical
ecology, as they may affect the structural and dynamical stability of
mutualistic systems.

(precisely describing the possible behaviors) or informal (merely a ""picture""
not allowing for any form of formal reasoning). Formal models are able to
classify traces (i.e., sequences of events) as fitting or non-fitting. Most
process mining approaches described in the literature produce such models. This
is in stark contrast with the over 25 available commercial process mining tools
that only discover informal process models that remain deliberately vague on
the precise set of possible traces. There are two main reasons why vendors
resort to such models: scalability and simplicity. In this paper, we propose to
combine the best of both worlds: discovering hybrid process models that have
formal and informal elements. As a proof of concept we present a discovery
technique based on hybrid Petri nets. These models allow for formal reasoning,
but also reveal information that cannot be captured in mainstream formal
models. A novel discovery algorithm returning hybrid Petri nets has been
implemented in ProM and has been applied to several real-life event logs. The
results clearly demonstrate the advantages of remaining ""vague"" when there is
not enough ""evidence"" in the data or standard modeling constructs do not ""fit"".
Moreover, the approach is scalable enough to be incorporated in
industrial-strength process mining tools.

Thermodynamic Formalism setting for a class of eigenmeasures of the dual of the
Ruelle operator, including several examples of interest in Statistical
Mechanics. In addition to deducing this inequality in cases not covered by
classical results about attractive specifications our proof has advantage of to
be easily adapted for suitable subshifts. We review (and provide proofs in our
setting) some classical results about the long-range Ising model on the lattice
$\mathbb{N}$ and use them to deduce some monotonicity properties of the
associated Ruelle operator and their relations with phase transitions.
  As is widely known, for some continuous potentials does not exists a positive
continuous eigenfunction associated to the spectral radius of the Ruelle
operator acting on $C(X)$. Here we employed some ideas related to the
involution kernel in order to solve the main eigenvalue problem in a suitable

explicit tight upper bound for the main eigenvalue (consequently for the
pressure) of the Ruelle operator associated to Ising models with
$1/r^{2+\varepsilon}$ interaction energy. Extensions of the Ruelle operator to

causes a toroidal torque known as neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV). The
toroidal symmetry of ITER will be broken by the finite number of toroidal field
coils and by test blanket modules (TBMs). The addition of ferritic inserts
(FIs) will decrease the magnitude of the toroidal field ripple. 3D magnetic
equilibria with toroidal field ripple and ferromagnetic structures are
calculated for an ITER steady-state scenario using the Variational Moments
Equilibrium Code (VMEC). Neoclassical transport quantities in the presence of
these error fields are calculated using the Stellarator Fokker-Planck Iterative
Neoclassical Conservative Solver (SFINCS). These calculations fully account for
$E_r$, flux surface shaping, multiple species, magnitude of ripple, and
collisionality rather than applying approximate analytic NTV formulae. As NTV
is a complicated nonlinear function of $E_r$, we study its behavior over a
plausible range of $E_r$. We estimate the toroidal flow, and hence $E_r$, using
a semi-analytic turbulent intrinsic rotation model and NUBEAM calculations of
neutral beam torque. The NTV from the $\rvert n \rvert = 18$ ripple dominates
that from lower $n$ perturbations of the TBMs. With the inclusion of FIs, the
magnitude of NTV torque is reduced by about 75% near the edge. We present
comparisons of several models of tangential magnetic drifts, finding
appreciable differences only for superbanana-plateau transport at small $E_r$.
We find the scaling of calculated NTV torque with ripple magnitude to indicate
that ripple-trapping may be a significant mechanism for NTV in ITER. The
computed NTV torque without ferritic components is comparable in magnitude to
the NBI and intrinsic turbulent torques and will likely damp rotation, but the
NTV torque is significantly reduced by the planned ferritic inserts.

which different nodes can have access to different sets of channels. By
providing multiple channels, they improve the efficiency and reliability of
wireless communication. However, the heterogeneous nature of cognitive radio
networks also brings new challenges to the design and analysis of distributed
algorithms.
  In this paper, we focus on two fundamental problems in cognitive radio
networks: neighbor discovery, and global broadcast. We consider a network
containing $n$ nodes, each of which has access to $c$ channels. We assume the
network has diameter $D$, and each pair of neighbors have at least $k\geq 1$,
and at most $k_{max}\leq c$, shared channels. We also assume each node has at
most $\Delta$ neighbors. For the neighbor discovery problem, we design a
randomized algorithm CSeek which has time complexity
$\tilde{O}((c^2/k)+(k_{max}/k)\cdot\Delta)$. CSeek is flexible and robust,
which allows us to use it as a generic ""filter"" to find ""well-connected""
neighbors with an even shorter running time. We then move on to the global
broadcast problem, and propose CGCast, a randomized algorithm which takes
$\tilde{O}((c^2/k)+(k_{max}/k)\cdot\Delta+D\cdot\Delta)$ time. CGCast uses
CSeek to achieve communication among neighbors, and uses edge coloring to
establish an efficient schedule for fast message dissemination.
  Towards the end of the paper, we give lower bounds for solving the two
problems. These lower bounds demonstrate that in many situations, CSeek and
CGCast are near optimal.

in the boundary theory and using the saddle point analysis of the worldsheet
OPE [1], we derive an explicit relation between OPE coefficients in the
boundary and worldsheet theories for the contribution of single trace spin
$\ell$ operators to the OPE. We also consider external vector operators and
obtain the relation between OPE coefficients for the exchange of single trace
scalar operators in the OPE. We revisit the relationship between the bulk cubic
couplings in the Supergravity approximation and the OPE coefficients in the
dual boundary theory. Our results match with the known examples from the case
of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. For the operators whose two and three point correlators
enjoy a non renormalization theorem, this gives a set of three way relations
between the bulk cubic couplings in supergravity and the OPE coefficients in
the boundary and worldsheet theories.

energized electron spectrum peaks at an energy near the ion drift energy, which
increases with bulk Lorentz factor, and the beaming of the accelerated

strong field is required to ensure that the electrons have sufficiently high
ground state Landau energy so that particle collisions, instabilities, and
strong electric and magnetic fields associated with the FRB radiation do not
perturb electrons' motion in the direction transverse to the magnetic field and
destroy their coherent motion; coherence is required by the high observed
brightness temperature of FRB radiation. The electric field in the source
region required to sustain particle motion for a wave period is estimated to be
of order 10^{11} esu. These requirements suggest that FRBs are produced near
the surface of magnetars perhaps via forced reconnection of magnetic fields to
produce episodic, repeated, outbursts. The beaming-corrected energy release in
these bursts is estimated to be ~10^{36} ergs, whereas the total energy in the
magnetic field is at least ~10^{45} ergs. We provide a number of predictions

(AGN), but the conditions under which this process occurs are poorly

that represent galaxy mergers hosting a single AGN. In this paper, we use our
offset AGN sample to constrain the parameters that affect AGN observability in
galaxy mergers. We also construct dual AGN samples with similar selection
properties for comparison. We find that the offset AGN fraction shows no
evidence for a dependence on AGN luminosity, while the dual AGN fractions show
stronger evidence for a positive dependence, suggesting that the merger events
forming dual AGN are more efficient at instigating accretion onto supermassive
black holes than those forming offset AGN. We also find that the offset and
dual AGN fractions both have a negative dependence on nuclear separation and
are similar in value at small physical scales. This dependence may become
stronger when restricted to high AGN luminosities, though a larger sample is
needed for confirmation. These results indicate that the probability of AGN
triggering increases at later merger stages. This study is the first to
systematically probe down to nuclear separations of <1 kpc (~0.8 kpc) and is
consistent with predictions from simulations that AGN observability peaks in

intragroup light. We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's
extended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding
intragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B. PNe were identified based on their
bright [OIII]5007 \AA\ emission and absence of a broad-band continuum. We
identify 738 PNe out to a radius of 155 kpc from M49's centre from which we
define a complete sample of 624 PNe within a limiting magnitude of m_5007=28.8.
Comparing the PN number density to the broad-band stellar surface brightness
profile, we find a variation of the PN-specific frequency (alpha-parameter)
with radius. The outer halo beyond 60 kpc has a 3.2 times higher
alpha-parameter compared to the main galaxy halo, which is likely due to
contribution from the surrounding blue IGL. We use the Planetary Nebulae
Luminosity Function (PNLF) as an indicator of distance and stellar population.
Its slope, which correlates empirically with galaxy type, varies within the
inner halo. In the eastern quadrant of M49, the PNLF slope is shallower,
indicating an additional localised, bright PN population following an accretion
event, likely that of the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC1249. We also determined a
distance modulus of mu = 31.29+/-0.08 for M49, corresponding to a physical
distance of 18.1+/-0.6 Mpc, which agrees with a recent surface-brightness
fluctuations distance. The PN populations in the outer halo of M49 are
consistent with the presence of a main Sersic galaxy halo with a slight (B-V)

formation efficiency should be much higher in the halos of such masses. Here we
use the model galaxy catalog generated by populating two large simulations: the
Millennium-II cosmological simulation and Phoenix simulations of 9 big clusters

demonstrate that UDGs are genuine dwarf galaxies, formed in the halos of $\sim
10^{10}M_{\odot}$. It is the combination of the late formation time and
high-spins of the host halos that results in the spatially extended feature of
this particular population. The lack of tidal disruption features of UDGs in

Subsequently, we discuss the role of the classical transpose channel (also

then prove some extensions of the saturation theorem, by finding faithful lower
bounds on a log-det conditional mutual information.
  In the second part, we focus on quantum Gaussian states, whose covariance
matrices are not only positive but obey additional constraints due to the
uncertainty relation. For Gaussian states, the log-det entropy is equivalent to
the R\'enyi entropy of order $2$. We provide a strengthening of log-det SSA for
quantum covariance matrices that involves the so-called Gaussian R\'enyi-$2$
entanglement of formation, a well-behaved entanglement measure defined via a
Gaussian convex roof construction. We then employ this result to define a

including both factorization and inversion, for solving general ${\cal

existing direct solutions, where the cluster bases are kept unchanged in the

algorithms update the cluster bases and their rank level by level based on
prescribed accuracy, without increasing computational complexity. Zeros are
also introduced level by level such that the size of the matrix blocks computed
at each tree level is the rank at that level, and hence being small. The
proposed new direct solution has been applied to solve electrically large
volume IEs whose rank linearly grows with electric size. A complexity of
$O(NlogN)$ in factorization and inversion time, and a complexity of $O(N)$ in
storage and solution time are both theoretically proven and numerically
demonstrated. For constant-rank cases, the proposed direct solution has a
strict $O(N)$ complexity in both time and memory. Rapid direct solutions of
millions of unknowns can be obtained on a single CPU core with directly
controlled accuracy.

show that close to $h_w(\beta)$, the free energy is approximately piecewise

in large-scale machines such as ITER, due to increased alpha heating. These are
significant enhancements that could lower the requirements needed to reach

neutron degradation. The potential realization rests on the survival of spin
polarization for periods comparable to the energy containment time. Interest in
polarized fuel options had an initial peak of activity in the 1980s, where
calculations predicted that polarizations could in fact survive a plasma.
However, concerns were raised regarding the cumulative impacts of fuel
recycling from the reactor walls. In addition, the technical challenges of
preparing and handling polarized materials prevented direct tests. Over the
last several decades, this situation has changed dramatically. Detailed
simulations of the ITER plasma have projected negligible wall recycling in a

inference in a Bayesian regime is based on a selective posterior. Such a
posterior is determined together by a generative model imposed on data and the
selection event that enforces a truncation on the assumed law. The effective
difference between the selective posterior and the usual Bayesian framework is
reflected in the use of a truncated likelihood. The normalizer of the truncated
law in the adjusted framework is the probability of the selection event; this
is typically intractable and it leads to the computational bottleneck in
sampling from such a posterior. The current work lays out a primal-dual
approach of solving an approximating optimization problem to provide valid
post-selective Bayesian inference. The selection procedures are posed as
data-queries that solve a randomized version of a convex learning program which
have the advantage of preserving more left-over information for inference. We
propose a randomization scheme under which the optimization has separable
constraints that result in a partially separable objective in lower dimensions
for many commonly used selective queries to approximate the otherwise
intractable selective posterior. We show that the approximating optimization
under a Gaussian randomization gives a valid exponential rate of decay for the
selection probability on a large deviation scale. We offer a primal-dual method
to solve the optimization problem leading to an approximate posterior; this
allows us to exploit the usual merits of a Bayesian machinery in both low and
high dimensional regimes where the underlying signal is effectively sparse. We
show that the adjusted estimates empirically demonstrate better frequentist
properties in comparison to the unadjusted estimates based on the usual
posterior, when applied to a wide range of constrained, convex data queries.

throwing away data improves the variance of the estimator. We therefore propose
two alternative estimators which we characterize theoretically and compare

capable, unlike continuous-time counterparts, to converge to a stable
equilibrium in finite time with zero error. We consider dissipative quantum
circuits consisting of sequences of quantum channels subject to specified
quasi-locality constraints, and determine conditions under which stabilization
of a pure multipartite entangled state of interest may be exactly achieved in
finite time. Special emphasis is devoted to characterizing scenarios where
finite-time stabilization may be achieved robustly with respect to the order of
the applied quantum maps, as suitable for unsupervised control architectures.
We show that if a decomposition of the physical Hilbert space into virtual
subsystems is found, which is compatible with the locality constraint and
relative to which the target state factorizes, then robust stabilization may be
achieved by independently cooling each component. We further show that if the
same condition holds for a scalable class of pure states, a continuous-time
quasi-local Markov semigroup ensuring rapid mixing can be obtained. Somewhat
surprisingly, we find that the commutativity of the canonical parent
Hamiltonian one may associate to the target state does not directly relate to
its finite-time stabilizability properties, although in all cases where we can
guarantee robust stabilization, a (possibly non-canonical) commuting parent
Hamiltonian may be found. Beside graph states, quantum states amenable to
finite-time robust stabilization include a class of universal resource states
displaying two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological order, along with
tensor network states obtained by generalizing a construction due to Bravyi and
Vyalyi. Extensions to representative classes of mixed graph-product and thermal

modeled as a virtual body combined with a two-dimensional hydrofoil pitching
intermittently about its leading edge. Lighthill (1971) originally proposed
that this burst-and-coast behavior can save fish energy during swimming by
taking advantage of the viscous Bone-Lighthill boundary layer thinning
mechanism. Here, an additional inviscid Garrick mechanism is discovered that
allows swimmers to control the ratio of their added mass thrust-producing
forces to their circulatory drag-inducing forces by decreasing their duty
cycle, DC, of locomotion. This mechanism can save intermittent swimmers as much
as 60% of the energy it takes to swim continuously at the same speed. The
inviscid energy savings are shown to increase with increasing amplitude of
motion, increase with decreasing Lighthill number, Li, and switch to an
energetic cost above continuous swimming for sufficiently low DC. Intermittent
swimmers are observed to shed four vortices per cycle that form into groups
that are self-similar with the DC. In addition, previous thrust and power
scaling laws of continuous self-propelled swimming are further generalized to
include intermittent swimming. The key is that by averaging the thrust and
power coefficients over only the bursting period then the intermittent problem
can be transformed into a continuous one. Furthermore, the intermittent thrust
and power scaling relations are extended to predict the mean speed and cost of
transport of swimmers. By tuning a few coefficients with a handful of
simulations these self-propelled relations can become predictive. In the
current study, the mean speed and cost of transport are predicted to within 3%
and 18% of their full-scale values by using these relations.

as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices with unprecedented
properties and ultra-compact performances. However atomically thin materials
are highly sensitive to surrounding dielectric media, which imposes severe
limitations to their practical applicability. Hence for their suitable
integration into devices, the development of reliable encapsulation procedures
that preserve their physical properties are required. Here, the excitonic
photoluminescence of WSe2 monolayer flakes is assessed, at room temperature and
10 K, on mechanically exfoliated flakes encapsulated with SiOx and AlxOy layers
employing chemical and physical deposition techniques. Conformal flakes coating
on untreated - non-functionalized - flakes is successfully demonstrated by all
the techniques except for atomic layer deposition, where a cluster-like oxide
coating is observed. No significant compositional or strain state changes in
the flakes are detected upon encapsulation by any of the techniques.
Remarkably, our results evidence that the flakes' optical emission is strongly
influenced by the quality of the encapsulating oxide - stoichiometry -. When
the encapsulation is carried out with slightly sub-stoichiometric oxides two
remarkable phenomena are observed. First, there is a clear electrical doping of
the monolayers that is revealed through a dominant trion - charged exciton -
room-temperature photoluminescence. Second, a strong decrease of the monolayers
optical emission is measured attributed to non-radiative recombination
processes and/or carriers transfer from the flake to the oxide. Power- and
temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements further confirm that
stoichiometric oxides obtained by physical deposition lead to a successful
encapsulation.

of multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in the MicroBooNE liquid argon time
projection chamber (LArTPC). This method does not require the full particle
ionization track to be contained inside of the detector volume as other track
momentum reconstruction methods do (range-based momentum reconstruction and
calorimetric momentum reconstruction). We motivate use of this technique,
describe a tuning of the underlying phenomenological formula, quantify its
performance on fully contained beam-neutrino-induced muon tracks both in
simulation and in data, and quantify its performance on exiting muon tracks in
simulation. Using simulation, we have shown that the standard Highland formula
should be re-tuned specifically for scattering in liquid argon, which
significantly improves the bias and resolution of the momentum measurement.
With the tuned formula, we find agreement between data and simulation for
contained tracks, with a small bias in the momentum reconstruction and with
resolutions that vary as a function of track length, improving from about 10%
for the shortest (one meter long) tracks to 5% for longer (several meter)
tracks. For simulated exiting muons with at least one meter of track contained,
we find a similarly small bias, and a resolution which is less than 15% for
muons with momentum below 2 GeV/c. Above 2 GeV/c, results are given as a first
estimate of the MCS momentum measurement capabilities of MicroBooNE for high
momentum exiting tracks.

the Orion Nebula is critically examined. This assumption underlies much of the
existing analysis of the nebula. In this paper we establish through comparison
of the relative strengths of emission lines with expectations from Cloudy
models and through the direction of the bright edges of proplyds that
Theta-2-Ori-A, which lies beyond the Bright Bar, also plays an important role.
Theta-1-Ori-C does dominate ionization in the inner part of the Orion Nebula,
but outside of the Bright Bar as far as the southeast boundary of the Extended
Orion Nebula, Theta-2-Ori-A is the dominant source. In addition to identifying
the ionizing star in sample regions, we were able to locate those portions of
the nebula in 3-D. This analysis illustrates the power of MUSE spectral imaging
observations in identifying sources of ionization in extended regions.

Pierre Auger Observatory designed to extend its energy range of detection and
to directly measure the muon content of the cosmic ray primary particle
showers. The array will be formed by an infill of surface water-Cherenkov
detectors associated with buried scintillation counters employed for muon
counting. Each counter is composed of three scintillation modules, with a 10
m$^2$ detection area per module. In this paper, a new generation of detectors,
replacing the current multi-pixel photomultiplier tube (PMT) with silicon photo
sensors (aka. SiPMs), is proposed. The selection of the new device and its
front-end electronics is explained. A method to calibrate the counting system
that ensures the performance of the detector is detailed. This method has the
advantage of being able to be carried out in a remote place such as the one
where the detectors are deployed. High efficiency results, i.e. 98 % efficiency
for the highest tested overvoltage, combined with a low probability of
accidental counting ($\sim$2 %), show a promising performance for this new
system.

Here, we report the applicability of DFT+U in explaining thermopower ($\alpha$)
and electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) in high temperature region. We have
measured temperature dependent $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ in the 300-600 K range.
The non-monotonic temperature dependent behavior of $\alpha$ and metallic
behavior of $\sigma$ were observed. The value of $\alpha$ at 300 K was
$\sim$15.80 $\mu$V/K and it decreases upto $\sim$477 K ($\sim$11.6 $\mu$V/K)
and it further increases with temperature to the $\sim$14.8 $\mu$V/K at 600 K,

programming these devices without error correction or compilation. This means
that the number of logical qubits is the same as the number of qubits on the
device. The hardware determines which pairs of qubits can be addressed by
unitary operators. The goal is to build quantum states that solve computational
problems such as maximizing a combinatorial objective function or minimizing a
Hamiltonian. These problems may not fit naturally on the physical layout of the
qubits. Our algorithms use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on
the qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters.
Measurements of the objective function (or Hamiltonian) guide the choice of new
parameters with the goal of moving the objective function up (or lowering the
energy). As an example we consider finding approximate solutions to MaxCut on
3-regular graphs whereas the hardware is physical qubits laid out on a
rectangular grid. We prove that the lowest depth version of the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm will achieve an approximation ratio of at
least 0.5293 on all large enough instances which beats random guessing (0.5).
We open up the algorithm to have different parameters for each single qubit $X$
rotation and for each $ZZ$ interaction associated with the nearest neighbor
interactions on the grid. Small numerical experiments indicate that an
enveloping classical algorithm can be used to find the parameters which sit on
the grid to optimize an objective function with a different connectivity. We
discuss strategies for finding good parameters but offer no evidence yet that
the proposed approach can beat the best classical algorithms. Ultimately the
strength of this approach will be determined by running on actual hardware.

simulated data to assess the ability to quantify and correctly identify

successive generations of tracking technology. 4. Care must be taken when
comparing data collected at differing time-scales, even when using inference

parameter estimation may be biased. In practice, comparisons may only be valid
when degrading all data to match the lowest resolution in a set. 5. Changes in

reappear, student difficulties can perpetuate from one context to the next, or
new difficulties can emerge as students encounter new physical contexts. One
example of such a topic is boundary conditions. It is broadly considered to be
an important topic that advanced physics undergraduates are expected to
understand and apply in multiple topical areas including classical mechanics,
quantum mechanics, and throughout electricity and magnetism (EM). We report
findings from an investigation of student difficulties using boundary
conditions focusing on the context of electrodynamics. Our data sources include
student responses to traditional exam questions, conceptual survey questions,
and think aloud interviews. The analysis was guided by an analytical framework
that characterizes how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on
boundary conditions. Common observed student difficulties include: activating
boundary conditions in appropriate contexts; constructing a complex expression
for the E&M waves; mathematically simplifying and manipulating complex
exponential and, checking if the reflection and transmission coefficient are
physical. We also present potential pedagogical implications based on our
observations.

video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g.
Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast,
less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish
mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's
preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require
sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms
[12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions
toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode
in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art
machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on
signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and
other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of
two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose
algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game
environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in
scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved
without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus
showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is
computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of

optimize the estimation and analyze data privacy is a critical and open issue.
In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed to investigate how to
optimize the estimation of neighbor's original data using the local information

of spherical Gauss--Bonnet--anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes. In general, the
eigenvalues of wave equations are found here numerically, but at a fixed
Gauss-Bonnet constant $\alpha = R^2/2$ (where $R$ is the AdS radius), an exact
solution of the scalar field equation has been obtained. Remarkably, the purely

perturbations, were found here even for a test scalar field. These purely
imaginary modes of the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet theory do not have the
Einsteinian limits, because their damping rates grow, when $\alpha$ is
decreasing. Thus, these modes are nonperturbative in $\alpha$. The real
oscillation frequencies of the perturbative branch are linearly related to
their Schwarzschild-AdS limits $Re (\omega_{GB}) = Re (\omega_{SAdS}) (1+ K(D)

particles using a nuclear reaction network containing $\sim 8000$ species. We
find that the previously known strong correlation between HMNS lifetime,
ejected mass, and average electron fraction in the outflow is directly related
to the amount of neutrino irradiation on the disk, which dominates mass
ejection at early times in the form of a neutrino-driven wind. Production of
lanthanides and actinides saturates at short HMNS lifetimes ($\lesssim 10$ ms),
with additional ejecta contributing to a blue optical kilonova component for
longer-lived HMNSs. We find good agreement between the abundances from the disk
outflow alone and the solar r-process distribution only for short HMNS
lifetimes ($\lesssim 10$ ms). For longer lifetimes, the rare-earth and third
r-process peaks are significantly under-produced compared to the solar pattern,
requiring additional contributions from the dynamical ejecta. The
nucleosynthesis signature from a spinning black hole (BH) can only overlap with
that from a HMNS of moderate lifetime ($\lesssim 60$ ms). Finally, we show that
angular momentum transport not only contributes with a late-time outflow
component, but that it also enhances the neutrino-driven component by moving
material to shallower regions of the gravitational potential, in addition to
providing additional heating.

model very accurately describes the growth rate of these instabilities at

stabilization of these instabilities at small spatial scales (high wavenumbers)
naturally requires dispersive effects and the stabilization is due to the Hall
term and finite Larmor radius (FLR) corrections to the pressure tensor. Even
though the stabilization is not completely accurate since at small spatial
scales a relatively strong collisionless damping comes into effect, we find
that the main concepts of the maximum growth rate and the stabilization of
these instabilities is indeed present in the fluid description. However, there
are differences that are quite pronounced when close to the firehose threshold
and that clarify the different profiles for marginally stable states with a
prescribed maximum growth rate $\gamma_{max}$ in the simple fluid models

marginal detection of binary black holes during their first observing run. The
first event, GW150914, was from the merger of two black holes much heavier that
those whose masses have been estimated so far, indicating a formation scenario
that might differ from ""ordinary"" stellar evolution. One possibility is that
these heavy black holes resulted from a previous merger. When the progenitors
of a black hole binary merger result from previous mergers, they should (on
average) merge later, be more massive, and have spin magnitudes clustered
around a dimensionless spin ~0.7. Here we ask the following question: can
gravitational-wave observations determine whether merging black holes were born
from the collapse of massive stars (""first generation""), rather than being the
end product of earlier mergers (""second generation"")? We construct simple,
observationally motivated populations of black hole binaries, and we use
Bayesian model selection to show that measurements of the masses, luminosity
distance (or redshift), and ""effective spin"" of black hole binaries can indeed
distinguish between these different formation scenarios.

shortcoming is that a huge number of vertices may have exactly the same score.
The third shortcoming is that in many applications, the distance between two
vertices not only depends on the length of shortest paths, but also on the
number of shortest paths. In this paper, first we develop a new distance
measure between vertices of a graph that yields discriminative distance-based
centrality indices. This measure is proportional to the length of shortest
paths and inversely proportional to the number of shortest paths. We present
algorithms for exact computation of the proposed discriminative indices.
Second, we develop randomized algorithms that precisely estimate average
discriminative path length and average discriminative eccentricity and show
that they give $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximations of these indices. Third, we
perform extensive experiments over several real-world networks from different
domains. In our experiments, we first show that compared to the traditional
indices, discriminative indices have usually much more discriminability. Then,
we show that our randomized algorithms can very precisely estimate average
discriminative path length and average discriminative eccentricity, using only
few samples. Then, we show that real-world networks have usually a tiny average
discriminative path length, bounded by a constant (e.g., 2). Fourth, in order

a novel link prediction method, that uses discriminative distance to decide

noise reveals image structure not easily visible in the originals, preserves

uses the statistical properties of noise and of local neighborhoods in the

Stochastically ""dropping out"" units with a certain probability discourages
over-specific co-adaptations of feature detectors, preventing overfitting and
improving network generalization. Besides, Dropout can be interpreted as an
approximate model aggregation technique, where an exponential number of smaller
networks are averaged in order to get a more powerful ensemble. In this paper,
we show that using a fixed dropout probability during training is a suboptimal
choice. We thus propose a time scheduling for the probability of retaining
neurons in the network. This induces an adaptive regularization scheme that
smoothly increases the difficulty of the optimization problem. This idea of
""starting easy"" and adaptively increasing the difficulty of the learning
problem has its roots in curriculum learning and allows one to train better
models. Indeed, we prove that our optimization strategy implements a very
general curriculum scheme, by gradually adding noise to both the input and
intermediate feature representations within the network architecture.
Experiments on seven image classification datasets and different network
architectures show that our method, named Curriculum Dropout, frequently yields
to better generalization and, at worst, performs just as well as the standard
Dropout method.

time evolution according to wave equations on the other hand, provided a
challenge to Bohr's proposal of quantum jumps in atoms. Furthermore,
Schroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of
the explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility
of superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed,
Schroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of
discrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different
energies.
  However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave
mechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full
implementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix
formalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the
identification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of
Fock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a
sum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock
space.
  In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering
matrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the
resolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution
therefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of
quantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate
that discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take
into account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the
role of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of
quantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually
expected.

to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process.
However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of

role of nuclear quantum effects in determining the charge transfer in a range
of hydrogen bonded species in the gas and liquid phase. We show that the
quantization of the nuclei gives rise to large changes in the magnitude of the
charge transfer as well as its temperature dependence. We then explain how a
single geometric parameter determines the charge transfer through the hydrogen
bond. These results thus demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are vital for
the accurate description of charge transfer and offer a physically transparent
way to understand how hydrogen bonding gives rise to it.

conduction and valence bands comes from the property that HOMO has ungerade

three-dimensional Brillouin zone, which is symmetric with respect to the plane
of $k_y$ = 0 where $k_y$ is the intralayer momentum along the molecular

recognition. If we define the context of the interaction to be the objects
involved, then most current methods can be categorized as either: (i) training
a single classifier on the combination of the interaction and its context; or
(ii) aiming to recognize the interaction independently of its explicit context.
Both methods suffer limitations: the former scales poorly with the number of
combinations and fails to generalize to unseen combinations, while the latter
often leads to poor interaction recognition performance due to the difficulty
of designing a context-independent interaction classifier. To mitigate those
drawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, context-aware interaction
recognition framework. The key to our method is to explicitly construct an
interaction classifier which combines the context, and the interaction. The
context is encoded via word2vec into a semantic space, and is used to derive a
classification result for the interaction.
  The proposed method still builds one classifier for one interaction (as per
type (ii) above), but the classifier built is adaptive to context via weights
which are context dependent. The benefit of using the semantic space is that it
naturally leads to zero-shot generalizations in which semantically similar
contexts (subjectobject pairs) can be recognized as suitable contexts for an
interaction, even if they were not observed in the training set.

the direct detections of the intermediate-frequency (i.e., from dozens to
hundreds of Hertz) gravitational waves (GWs) by probing their
mechanically-tidal responses. Alternatively, in this letter we propose a
feasible approach to actively search for the high-frequency GWs by probing
their electromagnetic responses (EMRs) in a high alternating magnetic field.
  Differing from the original Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich configuration (in which
the EMRs are proportional to the square of the amplitudes of the GWs, and
consequently are too weak to be detected experimentally), the EMRs of the GWs
passing through the present configuration are linearly related to the
amplitudes of the GWs and thus the relevant signals are detectable with the
current weak-light detection technique.
  As the wave impedances of the GWs-induced electromagnetic signals (EMSs) are
very different from those the EM radiations in flat space-time, i.e, ($\cong
377 \Omega$), the stronger background noises (without any GWs information)
could be effectively filtered out by using wave-matching technique.
  Given the frequency of the applied alternating magnetic field is conveniently
adjustable, the configuration proposed here could be utilized to actively
search for the GWs (if they really exist) in a sufficiently-wide frequency band
(e.g., could be $10^7-10^{12}$Hz), once the scale of the cavity and the
sweeping frequency of the applied alternating magnetic field are experimentally
achievable.

Due to the limited amount of data and information retrieved from low-resolution

preserving enough structure of the image such as the texture. This paper
presents a new single image super-resolution method which is based on adaptive
fractional-order gradient interpolation and reconstruction. The interpolated
image gradient via optimal fractional-order gradient is first constructed
according to the image similarity and afterwards the minimum energy function is
employed to reconstruct the final high-resolution image. Fractional-order
gradient based interpolation methods provide an additional degree of freedom
which helps optimize the implementation quality due to the fact that an extra
free parameter $\alpha$-order is being used. The proposed method is able to
produce a rich texture detail while still being able to maintain structural
similarity even under large zoom conditions. Experimental results show that the
proposed method performs better than current single image super-resolution
techniques.

efficiently. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper we propose a
framework, named ACoS, to adaptively tune the coordinate systems in EAs. In
ACoS, an Eigen coordinate system is established by making use of the cumulative
population distribution information, which can be obtained based on a
covariance matrix adaptation strategy and an additional archiving mechanism.
Since the population distribution information can reflect the features of the
function landscape to some extent, EAs in the Eigen coordinate system have the
capability to identify the modality of the function landscape. In addition, the
Eigen coordinate system is coupled with the original coordinate system, and
they are selected according to a probability vector. The probability vector
aims to determine the selection ratio of each coordinate system for each
individual, and is adaptively updated based on the collected information from
the offspring. ACoS has been applied to two of the most popular EA paradigms,
i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE), for

cosmological ""constant"" $\Lambda$ fluctuates between positive and negative
values with a vanishing mean, and with a magnitude comparable to the critical
density at any epoch. In accord with a longstanding heuristic prediction of
causal set theory, it postulates that $\Lambda$ is a stochastic function of
cosmic time that will vary from one realization of the scenario to another.
Herein, we consider two models of ""dark energy"" that exhibit these features.
Via Monte Carlo Markov chains, we explore the space of cosmological parameters
and the set of stochastic realizations of these models, finding that
Everpresent $\Lambda$ can fit the current cosmological observations as well as
the $\Lambda$CDM model does. Furthermore, it removes observational tensions
with $\Lambda$CDM, for low redshift measurements of Hubble constant, and the
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $z\sim 2-3$.
However, we also find that Everpresent $\Lambda$ does not significantly help
with the growth of ultramassive black holes at high redshift, and the Lithium
problem in Big Bang Nuclesynthesis. Future measurements of ""dark energy"" at
high redshifts will further test the viability of Everpresent $\Lambda$ as an
alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

centralized SMPC involves formulating a large-scale finite-horizon scenario
optimization problem at each sampling time, which is in general computationally
demanding, due to the large number of required scenarios. We present two novel

decompose the large-scale scenario program into distributed scenario programs

local decisions using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
We show the exactness of the decomposition with a-priori probabilistic

communication scheme based on a set parametrization technique together with the
notion of probabilistically reliable sets to reduce the required communication
between the subproblems. We show how to incorporate the probabilistic
reliability notion into existing results and provide new guarantees for the
desired level of constraint violations. Two different simulation studies of two
types of systems interactions, dynamically coupled and coupling constraints,

Non-Fermi liquid (NFL) and Fermi-liquid (FL) self-energies coexist in the
Brillouin zone. Moreover, it is also found that NFL self-energies survive up to
the overdoped region where the resistivity features a global FL-behavior. To
address this problem, here we compute the momentum dependent self-energy from a
single band Hubbard model. The self-energy is calculated self-consistently by
using a momentum-dependent density-fluctuation (MRDF) method. One of our main
result is that the computed self-energy exhibits a NFL-like frequency
dependence only in the antinodal region, and FL-like behavior elsewhere, and
retains its analytic form at all momenta and dopings. The dominant source of
NFL self-energy in the antinodal region stems from the self-energy-dressed
fluctuations between the itinerant and localized densities as self-consistency
is invoked. We also calculate the DC conductivity by including the full
momentum dependent self-energy. We find that the resistivity-temperature
exponent n becomes 1 near the optimal doping, while the NFL self-energy
occupies largest momentum-space volume. Surprisingly, even in the NFL state
near the optimal doping, the nodal region contains FL-like self-energies; while
in the under- and over-dopings (n ~ 2), the antinodal region remains NFL-like.
These results highlight the non-local correlation physics in cuprates and in
other similar intermediately correlated materials, where a direct link between
the microscopic single-particle spectral properties and the macroscopic
transport behavior can not be well established.

massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to
select a realistic subset, which we deem the Adversarial Imposters. We
demonstrate that this simple pipeline allows one to synthesize realistic
training data by making use of rendering/animation engines within a GAN
framework. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to
rank algorithms, suggesting that Adversarial Imposters can also be used for
""in-the-tail"" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for
real-world deployment.

  Invariant Training of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose the utterance-level Permutation Invariant Training
(uPIT) technique. uPIT is a practically applicable, end-to-end, deep learning
based solution for speaker independent multi-talker speech separation.
Specifically, uPIT extends the recently proposed Permutation Invariant Training
(PIT) technique with an utterance-level cost function, hence eliminating the
need for solving an additional permutation problem during inference, which is
otherwise required by frame-level PIT. We achieve this using Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) that, during training, minimize the utterance-level separation
error, hence forcing separated frames belonging to the same speaker to be
aligned to the same output stream. In practice, this allows RNNs, trained with
uPIT, to separate multi-talker mixed speech without any prior knowledge of
signal duration, number of speakers, speaker identity or gender. We evaluated
uPIT on the WSJ0 and Danish two- and three-talker mixed-speech separation tasks
and found that uPIT outperforms techniques based on Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) and Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA), and
compares favorably with Deep Clustering (DPCL) and the Deep Attractor Network
(DANet). Furthermore, we found that models trained with uPIT generalize well to
unseen speakers and languages. Finally, we found that a single model, trained
with uPIT, can handle both two-speaker, and three-speaker speech mixtures.

social scientists. Traditionally, the data used to support such studies is
manually obtained, often through surveys with volunteers. However, due to their
inherent high costs because of manual steps, such traditional methods do not
quickly scale to large-size studies. We here investigate a particular aspect of
gender differences: preferences for venues. To that end we explore the use of
check-in data collected from Foursquare to estimate cultural gender preferences
for venues in the physical world. For that, we first demonstrate that by
analyzing the check-in data in various regions of the world we can find
significant differences in preferences for specific venues between gender
groups. Some of these significant differences reflect well-known cultural
patterns. Moreover, we also gathered evidence that our methodology offers
useful information about gender preference for venues in a given region in the
real world. This suggests that gender and venue preferences observed may not be
independent. Our results suggests that our proposed methodology could be a
promising tool to support studies on gender preferences for venues at different
spatial granularities around the world, being faster and cheaper than
traditional methods, besides quickly capturing changes in the real world.

performs relational inference. It consists of several interconnected,
structurally equivalent populations of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons,
which are trained in a self-organized fashion with spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP). Despite its robust learning dynamics, the model is
susceptible to a problem typical for recurrent networks which use a correlation
based (Hebbian) learning rule: if trained with high learning rates, the
recurrent connections can cause strong feedback loops in the network dynamics,
which lead to the emergence of attractor states. This causes a strong reduction
in the number of representable patterns and a decay in the inference ability of
the network. As a solution, we introduce a conceptually very simple
""wake-sleep"" algorithm: during the wake phase, training is executed normally,
while during the sleep phase, the network ""dreams"" samples from its generative
model, which are induced by random input. This process allows us to activate
the attractor states in the network, which can then be unlearned effectively by
an anti-Hebbian mechanism. The algorithm allows us to increase learning rates
up to a factor of ten while avoiding clustering, which allows the network to
learn several times faster. Also for low learning rates, where clustering is
not an issue, it improves convergence speed and reduces the final inference
error.

Key features of its distribution can be represented by kinematic models which

how the interplay between large-scale advection, small-scale turbulence and
condensation controls the moisture distribution, we develop simple kinematic

water-vapour anomaly released inside a vortex at an initial time. Next, we
consider a cellular flow with a moisture source at a boundary. The
statistically steady state attained shows features reminiscent of the Hadley
cell such as boundary layers, a region of intense precipitation and a relative
humidity minimum. Explicit results provide a detailed characterisation of these
features in the limit of strong flow.

conjectures of complexity, the ""Complexity = Action"" (CA) duality and
""Complexity = Volume 2.0"" (CV) duality. The complexity of a boundary state is
identified with the action of the Wheeler-deWitt patch in CA duality, while
this complexity is identified with the spacetime volume of the WdW patch in CV
duality. In particular, we check whether the Born-Infeld black holes violate
the Lloyd bound: $\mathcal{\dot{C}\leq}\frac{2}{\pi\hbar}\left[ \left(
M-Q\Phi\right) -\left( M-Q\Phi\right) _{\text{gs}}\right] $, where gs stands
for the ground state for a given electrostatic potential. We find that the
ground states are either some extremal black hole or regular spacetime with
nonvanishing charges. Near extremality, the Lloyd bound is violated in both
dualities. Near the charged regular spacetime, this bound is satisfied in CV
duality but violated in CA duality. When moving away from the ground state on a
constant potential curve, the Lloyd bound tend to be saturated from below in CA
duality, while $\mathcal{\dot{C}}$ is $\pi/2$ times as large as the Lloyd bound
in CV duality.

GW151226, as well as for gravitational wave candidate LVT151012. We find 2 and
4 neutrino candidates detected by IceCube, and 1 and 0 detected by ANTARES,

with the expected background rate. None of these neutrino candidates are found
to be directionally coincident with GW151226 or LVT151012. We use non-detection

infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This is an obstacle in the development of
local analysis, in particular in the questions of extending local maps onto the
whole space. We suggest an approach that substitutes bump functions with
special maps, which we call K-maps. It allows us to extend smooth local maps
from non-smooth spaces, such as $C^q[0,1], q=0,1,...$. We also prove the Borel
lemma for spaces possessing K-maps.

  Research (B. Hnatkowska and M. \'Smia{\l}ek, eds.), pp. 163-176, 2016",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Defect prediction in software can be highly beneficial for
development projects, when prediction is highly effective and defect-prone
areas are predicted correctly. One of the key elements to gain effective
software defect prediction is proper selection of metrics used for dataset
preparation. Objective: The purpose of this research is to verify, whether code
smells metrics, collected using Microsoft CodeAnalysis tool, added to basic
metric set, can improve defect prediction in industrial software development
project. Results: We verified, if dataset extension by the code smells sourced
metrics, change the effectiveness of the defect prediction by comparing
prediction results for datasets with and without code smells-oriented metrics.
In a result, we observed only small improvement of effectiveness of defect
prediction when dataset extended with bad smells metrics was used: average
accuracy value increased by 0.0091 and stayed within the margin of error.
However, when only use of code smells based metrics were used for prediction
(without basic set of metrics), such process resulted with surprisingly high
accuracy (0.8249) and F-measure (0.8286) results. We also elaborated data
anomalies and problems we observed when two different metric sources were used
to prepare one, consistent set of data. Conclusion: Extending the dataset by
the code smells sourced metric does not significantly improve the prediction
effectiveness. Achieved result did not compensate effort needed to collect
additional metrics. However, we observed that defect prediction based on the
code smells only is still highly effective and can be used especially where
other metrics hardly be used.

diffusion effect into account. The grid parameters are hydrogen mass
log($M_{H}/M_{*}$), helium mass log($M_{He}/M_{*}$), stellar mass $M_{\rm *}$,
and effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ for DAV stars. The core compositions
are from white dwarf models evolved by \texttt{MESA}. Therefore, those DAV star
models evolved by \texttt{WDEC} have historically viable core compositions.
Based on those DAV star models, we studied the rate of period change
($\dot{P}(k)$) for different values of H, He, $M_{\rm *}$, and $T_{\rm eff}$.
The results are consistent with previous work. Two DAV stars G117-B15A and R548
have been observed around forty years. The rates of period change of two
large-amplitude modes were obtained through O-C method. We did
asteroseismological study on the two DAV stars and then obtained a best-fitting
model for each star. Based on the two best-fitting models, the mode
identifications ($l$, $k$) of the observed modes for G117-B15A and R548 are
consistent with previous work. Both the observed modes and the observed
$\dot{P}$s can be fitted by calculated ones. The results indicate that our
method of evolving DAV star models is feasible.

interference between a source-free standing plane wave and a wave generated by
a pulse in a current sheet. Depending upon the relative phases between the
standing wave and the current pulse and also upon the relative magnitudes, we
can find quite different patterns of emitted energy and momentum. If the source
gives a large radiation pulse so that the source-free plane wave can be
neglected, then the radiation spreads out symmetrically on either side of the
current sheet. However, if the radiation sheet gives a pulse with fields
comparable to those of the standing wave, then we can find a single radiation
pulse moving to the right while the current sheet recoils to the left, or the
situation with the directions reversed. The example is a crude illustration of
particle-like behavior arising from conventional classical electromagnetic
behavior in the presence of source-free radiation. The discussion makes contact

economical sciences. Much of the discrimination observed in empirical studies
can be explained by the theory of in-group favoritism, which states that people
tend to act more positively towards peers whose appearances are more similar to
their own. Some studies, however, find hierarchical structures in inter-group
relations, where members of low-status groups also favor the high-status group
members. These observations cannot be understood in the light of in-group
favoritism. Here we present an agent based model in which evolutionary dynamics
can result in a hierarchical discrimination between two groups characterized by
a meaningless, but observable binary label. We find that discriminating
strategies end up dominating the system when the selection pressure is high,
i.e. when agents have a much higher probability of imitating their neighbor
with the highest payoff. These findings suggest that the puzzling persistence
of hierarchical discrimination may result from the evolutionary dynamics of the
social system itself, namely the social imitation dynamics. It also predicts
that discrimination will occur more often in highly competitive societies.

State-of-the-art process discovery algorithms only discover local control-flow
patterns and are unable to discover complex, non-local patterns. Region theory
based techniques, i.e. an established class of process discovery techniques, do
allow for discovering such patterns. However, applying region theory directly
results in complex, over-fitting models, which is less desirable. Moreover,
region theory does not cope with guarantees provided by state-of-the-art
process discovery algorithms, both w.r.t. structural and behavioural properties
of the discovered process models. In this paper we present an ILP-based process
discovery approach, based on region theory, that guarantees to discover relaxed
sound workflow nets. Moreover, we devise a filtering algorithm, based on the
internal working of the ILP-formulation, that is able to cope with the presence
of infrequent behaviour. We have extensively evaluated the technique using
different event logs with different levels of exceptional behaviour. Our
experiments show that the presented approach allow us to leverage the inherent
shortcomings of existing region-based approaches. The techniques presented are

been recently demonstrated that a remarkable change of seismicity emerges
before major mainshocks in California. What constitutes this change is that the
fluctuations of the order parameter of seismicity exhibit a clearly detectable
minimum. This is identified by using a natural time window sliding event by
event through the time series of the earthquakes in a wide area and comprising
a number of events that would occur on the average within a few months or so.
Here, we suggest a method to estimate the epicentral area of an impending
mainshock by an additional study of this minimum using an area window sliding
through the wide area. We find that when this area window surrounds (or is
adjacent to) the future epicentral area, the minimum of the order parameter
fluctuations in this area appears at a date very close to the one at which the
minimum is observed in the wide area. The method is applied here to major
earthquakes that occurred in California during the recent decades including the
largest one, i.e., the 1992 Landers earthquake.

Present work mainly focuses on the efficient and qualitative detection of a

arising from spin orbit metal is expected to impose a torque on the free layer
along sensitive direction improving the signal strength by a factor of ~ 6.5

observed to be sufficient to enhance the sensitivity (~ 6 times). The use of
