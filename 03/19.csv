execution of maneuvers relative to a nominal target. These types of maneuvers
are frequently utilized in missions such as rendezvous and docking, satellite
inspection and formation flight where exclusion zones representing spacecraft
or other obstacles must be avoided. The presence of these exclusion zones leads
to non-linear and non-convex constraints which must be satisfied. In this
paper, a novel approach to spacecraft relative motion planning with obstacle
avoidance and thrust constraints is developed. This approach is based on a
graph search applied to a virtual net of closed (periodic) natural motion
trajectories, where the natural motion trajectories represent virtual net nodes
(vertices), and adjacency and connection information is determined by
conditions defined in terms of safe, positively-invariant tubes built around
each trajectory. These conditions guarantee that transitions from one natural
motion trajectory to another natural motion trajectory can be completed without
constraint violations. The proposed approach improves the flexibility of a
previous approach based on the use of forced equilibria, and has other
advantages in terms of reduced fuel consumption and passive safety. The
resulting maneuvers, if planned on-board, can be executed directly or, if
planned off board, can be used to warm start trajectory optimizers to generate
further improvements.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.00325",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are three different methods used to search the neutrino mass: - The
electron antineutrino mass can probably best be determined by the Triton decay.
- The neutrinoless Double Beta Decay yields information, if the neutrino is a
Dirac or a Majorana particle. It can also determine the Majorana neutrino mass.
- Electron capture of an atomic bound electron by a proton in a nucleus bound
electron plus proton to neutron plus electron-neutrino can give the mass of the
electron neutrino. This contribution summarizes our theoretical work on the
possibility to determine the electron neutrino mass by electron capture. One
expects the largest influence of the neutrino mass on this decay for a small Q
= 2.8 keV for electron capture in Holmium. The energy of the Q value is
distributed to the emitted neutrino and the excitation of the Dy atom. Thus the
energy difference between the Q value and the upper end of the deexcitation
spectrum is the electron neutrino mass. The excitation spectrum of Dy is
calculate by one-, two- and three-electron hole excitations, and by the
shake-off process. The electron wave functions are calculated selfconsistently
by the Dirac-Hartree-Fock approach for the bound and the continuum states. To
extract the neutrino mass from the spectrum one must adjust simultaneously the
neutrino mass, the Q value, the position, the relative strength and the width
of the highest resonance. This fit is only possible, if the background is
reduced relative to the present situation. In case of a drastically reduced
background a fit of the Q-value and the neutrino mass only seems also to be
possible. The analysis presented here shows, that the determination of the
electron neutrino mass by electron capture is difficult, but seems not to be
impossible.

incompressible fluid assumption does not lead to the well known Schwarzschild
interior metric of Einstein gravity and a term denoting the presence of a
cosmological constant is present on account of the integration process. The
Schwarzschild interior is regained as a special case of a richer geometry. On
the other hand, when the Schwarzschild geometry is prescribed, a constant
density fluid emerges consistent with the standard equations. A complete model
of an isothermal fluid sphere with pressure and density obeying the inverse
square law is obtained. Corrections to the model previously presented in the

not yield a constant gravitational potential in general but both potentials are
position dependent. Conversely, it is shown that assuming a constant $g_{rr}$
gravitational potential does not yield an isothermal fluid in general as is the
case in standard general relativity. The results of the standard Einstein
equations are special cases of the models reported here. Noteworthy is the fact
that whereas the previously reported isothermal solution was only of

observation. Under such scenarios, we consider the fundamental problem of
recovering spectral properties of the underlying matrix from a sampling of its
entries. We are particularly interested in directly recovering the spectrum,
which is the set of singular values, and also in sample-efficient approaches
for recovering a spectral sum function, which is an aggregate sum of the same
function applied to each of the singular values. We propose first estimating
the Schatten $k$-norms of a matrix, and then applying Chebyshev approximation
to the spectral sum function or applying moment matching in Wasserstein
distance to recover the singular values. The main technical challenge is in
accurately estimating the Schatten norms from a sampling of a matrix. We
introduce a novel unbiased estimator based on counting small structures in a
graph and provide guarantees that match its empirical performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Schatten norms can be recovered accurately from
strictly smaller number of samples compared to what is needed to recover the

[Kuo,2003]. Moreover, a fast version of our method, based on the fast CBC
algorithm by Nuyens and Cools, is available, reducing the computational cost of
the algorithm to $O(d \, n \log(n))$ operations, where $n$ denotes the number
of function evaluations. Numerical experiments seeded by a Korobov-type
generating vector show that the new SCS algorithm will find better choices than
the CBC algorithm and the effect is better when the weights decay slower.

related to the measure $\mu_{\eta}([-\frac12,\frac12])$ by the Ergodic Theorem.
We show that the density of $\mu_\eta$ is piecewise smooth except for a set of

the density is piecewise smooth. We give an explicit formula for the frequency

null hypotheses, a natural testing strategy is to first reduce the number of
tested hypotheses by some selection (screening or filtering) process, and then
to simultaneously test the selected hypotheses. The main advantage of this
strategy is to greatly reduce the severe effect of high dimensions. However,
the first screening or selection stage must be properly accounted for in order
to maintain some type of error control. In this paper, we will introduce a
selection rule based on a selection statistic that is independent of the test
statistic when the tested hypothesis is true. Combining this selection rule and
the conventional Bonferroni procedure, we can develop a powerful and valid
two-stage procedure. The introduced procedure has several nice properties: (i)
it completely removes the selection effect; (ii) it reduces the multiplicity
effect; (iii) it does not ""waste"" data while carrying out both selection and
testing. Asymptotic power analysis and simulation studies illustrate that this
proposed method can provide higher power compared to usual multiple testing
methods while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Optimal selection thresholds
are also derived based on our asymptotic analysis.

set that can always be guaranteed for a family of compact convex sets in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfies the $(p,q)$ property. Hadwiger and Debrunner
showed that $HD_d(p,q) \geq p-q+1$ for all $q$, and equality is attained for $q
> \frac{d-1}{d}p +1$. Almost tight upper bounds for $HD_d(p,q)$ for a
`sufficiently large' $q$ were obtained recently using an enhancement of the
celebrated Alon-Kleitman theorem, but no sharp upper bounds for a general $q$
are known.
  In [L. Montejano and P. Sober\'{o}n, Piercing numbers for balanced and
unbalanced families, Disc. Comput. Geom., 45(2) (2011), pp. 358-364], Montejano
and Sober\'{o}n defined a refinement of the $(p,q)$ property: $F$ satisfies the
$(p,q)_r$ property if among any $p$ elements of $F$, at least $r$ of the
$q$-tuples intersect. They showed that $HD_d(p,q)_r \leq p-q+1$ holds for all
$r>{{p}\choose{q}}-{{p+1-d}\choose{q+1-d}}$; however, this is far from being
tight.
  In this paper we present improved asymptotic upper bounds on $HD_d(p,q)_r$
which hold when only a tiny portion of the $q$-tuples intersect. In particular,
we show that for $p,q$ sufficiently large, $HD_d(p,q)_r \leq p-q+1$ holds with
$r = \frac{1}{p^{\frac{q}{2d}}}{{p}\choose{q}}$. Our bound misses the known
lower bound for the same piercing number by a factor of less than $pq^d$.

Hadwiger-Debrunner theorem and the recent improved upper bound on $HD_d(p,q)$

renewed interest because of its ability to suppress modifications to General
Relativity in the weak field, while introducing large corrections in the strong
field of compact objects through a process called scalarization. A large sector
of this theory that allows for scalarization, however, has been shown to be in
conflict with Solar System observations when accounting for the cosmological
evolution of the scalar field. We here study an extension of this theory by
endowing the scalar field with a mass to determine whether this allows the
theory to pass Solar System constraints upon cosmological evolution for a
larger sector of coupling parameter space. We show that the cosmological scalar
field goes first through a quiescent phase, similar to the behavior of a
massless field, but then it enters an oscillatory phase, with an amplitude (and
frequency) that decays (and grows) exponentially. We further show that after
the field enters the oscillatory phase, its effective energy density and
pressure are approximately those of dust, as expected from previous
cosmological studies. Due to these oscillations, we show that the scalar field
cannot be treated as static today on astrophysical scales, and so we use
time-dependent perturbation theory to compute the scalar-field-induced
modifications to Solar System observables. We find that these modifications are
suppressed when the mass of the scalar field and the coupling parameter of the
theory are in a wide range, allowing the theory to pass Solar System
constraints, while in principle possibly still allowing for scalarization.

technique in model-driven engineering (MDE) given that they both emphasize
abstraction and automation. Given the diversity of tools and approaches, it is
necessary to classify existing TBCG techniques to better guide developers in
their choices. The goal of this article is to better understand the
characteristics of TBCG techniques and associated tools, identify research
trends, and assess the importance of the role of MDE in this code synthesis
approach. We conducted a systematic mapping study of the literature to paint an
interesting picture about the trends and uses of TBCG. Our study shows that the
community has been diversely using TBCG over the past 15 years. TBCG has
greatly benefited from MDE. It has favored a template style that is
output-based and high level modeling languages as input. TBCG is mainly used to
generate source code and has been applied in a variety of domains. Furthermore,
both MDE and non-MDE tools are becoming effective development resources in
industry.

of gravity and electromagnetism, following Weyl's insights regarding the
appealing potential connection between the gauge invariance of electromagnetism
and the conformal invariance of the gravitational field. We highlight that
changing the local symmetry group of spacetime permits to construct a theory in
which these two symmetries are combined into a putative gauge symmetry but with
second-order field equations and non-trivial mass scales, unlike the original
higher-order construction by Weyl. We prove that the gravitational field
equations are equivalent to the (trace-free) Einstein field equations, ensuring
their compatibility with known tests of general relativity. As a corollary, the
effective cosmological constant is rendered radiatively stable due to Weyl
invariance. A novel phenomenological consequence characteristic of this
construction, potentially relevant for cosmological observations, is the
existence of an energy scale below which effects associated with the
non-integrability of spacetime distances, and an effective mass for the
electromagnetic field, appear simultaneously (as dual manifestations of the use
of Weyl connections). We explain how former criticisms against Weyl's ideas
lose most of their power in its present reincarnation, which we refer to as
Weyl relativity, as it represents a Weyl-invariant, unified description of both
the Einstein and Maxwell field equations.

model we know the magnetic field vector in the entire 3D domain, which enables
us to perform ""voxel-by-voxel"" comparison of the restored and the true magnetic

pi-disambiguation methods often fail at the quiet sun areas dominated by
small-scale magnetic elements, while they work well at the AR photosphere and
(even better) chromosphere. The preprocessing of the photospheric magnetic
field, although does produce a more force-free boundary condition, also results
in some effective `elevation' of the magnetic field components. This
`elevation' height is different for the longitudinal and transverse components,
which results in a systematic error in absolute heights in the reconstructed
magnetic data cube. The extrapolations performed starting from actual AR
photospheric magnetogram are free from this systematic error, while have other
metrics comparable with those for extrapolations from the preprocessed
magnetograms. This finding favors the use of extrapolations from the original
photospheric magnetogram without preprocessing. Our tests further suggest that
extrapolations from a force-free chromospheric boundary produce measurably
better results, than those from the photospheric boundary.

budget to each social interaction: a high-degree individual may have less time
to dedicate to individual social links, forcing them to modulate the quantities
of contact made to their different social ties. Here we study the friendship
paradox in the context of differing contact volumes between egos and alters,
finding a connection between contact volume and the strength of the friendship
paradox. The most frequently contacted alters exhibit a less pronounced
friendship paradox compared with the ego, whereas less-frequently contacted
alters are more likely to be high degree and give rise to the paradox. We argue
therefore for a more nuanced version of the friendship paradox: ""your closest

""your best friend has no more friends than you do"". We demonstrate that this

promising for photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Films grown at 400-500 C were then
annealed to 600 C under Se, which caused K loss by evaporation in proportion to
initial K/(K+Cu) composition. Similar to growth temperature, annealing drove
CKIS alloy consumption and CuInSe2 + KInSe2 production, as evidenced by high

unavailable. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel, weakly-supervised
learning architecture (DCNN-GPC) which combines parametric models (a pair of
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for RGB and D modalities) with
non-parametric models (Gaussian Process Classification). Our system is
initially trained using a small amount of labeled data, and then automatically
prop- agates labels to large-scale unlabeled data. We first run 3D- based
objectness detection on RGBD videos to acquire many unlabeled object proposals,
and then employ DCNN-GPC to label them. As a result, our multi-modal DCNN can
be trained end-to-end using only a small amount of human annotation. Finally,
our 3D-based objectness detection and multi-modal DCNN are integrated into a
real-time detection and recognition pipeline. In our approach, bounding-box
annotations are not required and boundary-aware detection is achieved. We also
propose a novel way to pretrain a DCNN for the depth modality, by training on
virtual depth images projected from CAD models. We pretrain our multi-modal
DCNN on public 3D datasets, achieving performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods on Washington RGBS Dataset. We then finetune the
network by further training on a small amount of annotated data from our novel
dataset of industrial objects (nuclear waste simulants). Our weakly supervised

Constraining the solution of the polynomial problem to belong to the set of

direction, we obtain the effective equations at large $D$ to describe the
nonlinear dynamical deformations of the black holes. From the perturbation
analysis on the effective equations, we get the analytic expressions of the
frequencies for the quasinormal modes of charge and scalar-type perturbations.
We show that for a positive Gauss-Bonnet term, the black hole could become
unstable only if the cosmological constant is positive, otherwise the black
hole is always stable. However, for a negative Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that
the black hole could always be unstable. The instability of the black hole
depends not only on the cosmological constant and the charge, but also
significantly on the Gauss-Bonnet term. Moreover, at the onset of instability
there is a non-trivial static zero-mode perturbation, which suggests the
existence of a new non-spherically symmetric solution branch. We construct the
non-spherical symmetric static solutions of the large $D$ effective equations

While most prior work has assumed an infinite amount of enzymes deployed around
the channel, from a resource perspective, it is more efficient to deploy a

considers carrying out such deployment at two structures--around the receiver

optimized film exhibits Tc_onset = 26.6 and Tc_zero = 22.4 K along with a high
self-field Jc at 4 K (~1 MA/cm2) and relatively isotropic Jc under magnetic
fields up to 9 T. Unexpectedly, we found that lower crystallinity samples,
which were grown at a higher Ts of 1250 degree C than the optimized Ts = 1050
degree C, exhibit higher Jc along the ab plane under high magnetic fields than
the optimized samples. The presence of horizontal defects that act as strong
vortex pinning centers, such as stacking faults, are a possible origin of the
high Jc values in the poor crystallinity samples.

342 X-1 with NuSTAR and Swift in 2016 October, in which we captured the very
moment when the source showed spectral variation. The Swift/XRT spectrum
obtained in October 9--11 has a power-law shape and is consistent with those
observed in the coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations in 2012. In
October 16--17, when the 3--10 keV flux became $\approx$4 times higher, we
performed simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift observations. In this epoch, the source
showed a more round-shaped spectrum like that seen with ASCA 23 years ago.
Thanks to the wide energy coverage and high sensitivity of NuSTAR, we obtained
hard X-ray data covering up to $\sim$30 keV for the first time during the high
luminosity state of IC 342 X-1. The observed spectrum has a broader profile
than the multi-color disk blackbody model. The X-ray flux decreased again in
the last several hours of the NuSTAR observation, when the spectral shape
approached those seen in 2012 and 2016 October 9--11. The spectra obtained in
our observations and in 2012 can be commonly described with disk emission and
its Comptonization in cool ($T_{\rm e} \approx 4$ keV), optically-thick ($\tau
\approx 5$) plasma. The spectral turnover seen at around 5--10 keV shifts to
higher energies as the X-ray luminosity decreases. This behavior is consistent
with that predicted from recent numerical simulations of super-Eddington
accretion flows with Compton-thick outflows. We suggest that the spectral
evolution observed in IC 342 X-1 can be explained by a smooth change in mass
accretion rate.

further confirmed in experiment, which have wide applications in nanoscale

properties of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers are systematically investigated,
based on semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. It is found that spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) has important effects on electronic transport coefficients in
p-type doping, but neglectful influences on n-type ones. The room-temperature
sheet thermal conductance is 14.2 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for SbTeI and 12.6
$\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for BiTeI, which are lower than one of most well-known 2D
materials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenide, group IV-VI, group-VA and
group-IV monolayers. By analyzing group velocities and phonon lifetimes, the
very low sheet thermal conductance of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers is mainly
due to small group velocities. It is found that the high-frequency optical
branches contribute significantly to the total thermal conductivity, being
obviously different from usual picture with little contribution from optical
branches. According to cumulative lattice thermal conductivity with respect to
phonon mean free path (MFP), it is difficulty to further reduce lattice thermal
conductivity by nanostructures. Finally, possible thermoelectric figure of
merit $ZT$ of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers are calculated. It is found that
the p-type doping has more excellent thermoelectric properties than n-type
doping, and at room temperature, the peak $ZT$ can reach 1.11 for SbTeI and
0.87 for BiTeI, respectively. These results make us believe that ATeI (A=Sb and

Quantum Theory of Gravity, entanglement is expected to play a key role in the
reconstruction of spacetime geometry, we investigate the possibility of using
the formalism of Geometric Quantum Mechanics (GQM) to give a tensorial
characterization of entanglement on spin network states. Our analysis focuses
on the simple case of a single link graph (Wilson line state) for which we
define a dictionary to construct a Riemannian metric tensor and a symplectic
structure on the space of states. The manifold of (pure) quantum states is then
stratified in terms of orbits of equally entangled states and the
block-coefficient matrices of the corresponding pulled-back tensors fully
encode the information about separability and entanglement. In particular, the
off-diagonal blocks define an entanglement monotone interpreted as a distance
with respect to the separable state. As such, it provides a measure of graph
connectivity. Finally, in the maximally entangled gauge-invariant case, the
entanglement monotone is proportional to a power of the area of the surface
dual to the link. This suggests a connection between the GQM formalism and the
(simplicial) geometric properties of spin network states through entanglement.

large compared with the X-ray estimate of M ~ 2.5. The extent to which the
X-ray temperature jump is diluted by cooler unshocked gas projected through the
cluster currently lacks quantification. Thus, here we apply our self-consistent
N-body/hydro-dynamical code (based on FLASH) to model this binary cluster
encounter. We can account for the location of the shock front and also the
elongated X-ray emission by tidal stretching of the gas and dark matter between
the two cluster centers. The required total mass is $8.9 \times 10^{14}$ Msun
with a 1.3:1 mass ratio favoring the southern cluster component. The relative
velocity we derive is $\simeq 2500$ km/s initially between the two main cluster
components, with an impact parameter of 120 kpc. This solution implies that the
shock temperature jump derived from the low angular resolution X-ray satellite
SUZAKU is underestimated by a factor of two, due to cool gas in projection,
bringing the observed X-ray and radio estimates into agreement. We propose that
the complex southern relics in CIZA J2242.8+5301, have been broken up as the
southerly moving ""back"" shocked gas impacts the gas still falling in along the
collision axis. Finally, we use our model to generate Compton-y maps to
estimate the reduction in radio flux caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect. At 30 GHz, this amounts to $\Delta S_n = -0.072$ mJy/arcmin$^2$
and $\Delta S_s = -0.075$ mJy/arcmin$^2$ at the locations of the northern and
southern shock fronts respectively. Our model estimate agrees with previous
empirical estimates that have inferred the measured radio spectra can be
significantly affected by the SZ effect, with implications for charged particle
acceleration models of the radio relics.

120 through broad-band X-ray spectroscopy, fractional root-mean-squared (rms)
spectral modelling, hardness-intensity diagram and flux-flux analysis. The
X-ray (0.3-10 keV) spectra are well fitted by a thermally Comptonized primary
continuum with two (blurred and distant) reflection components and an optically
thick, warm Comptonization component for the soft X-ray excess emission below
~2 keV. During the first and third observations, the fractional X-ray
variability amplitude decreases with energy while for second and fourth
observations, X-ray variability spectra are found to be inverted-crescent and
crescent shaped respectively. The rms variability spectra are well modelled by
two constant reflection components, a soft excess component with variable
luminosity and a variable intrinsic continuum with the normalization and
spectral slope being correlated. The spectral softening of the source with both
the soft excess and UV luminosities favour Comptonization models where the soft
excess and primary X-ray emission are produced through Compton up-scattering of
the UV and UV/soft X-ray seed photons in the putative warm and hot coronae,
respectively. Our analyses imply that the observed energy-dependent variability
of Ark 120 is most likely due to variations in the spectral shape and
luminosity of the hot corona and to variations in the luminosity of the warm
corona, both of which are driven by variations in the seed photon flux.

apparent ambiguities. In particular, the only (physical) 'ambiguity parameters'

effects, which first appear at fifth Post-Newtonian (5PN) order for
non-spinning bodies. We demonstrate that the ambiguities linked to IR
divergences in the near zone, that plague the recent derivations of the binding

resolved by implementing the so-called 'zero-bin' subtraction in the EFT
framework. The procedure yields ambiguity-free results without the need of

telescopes to form a tied-array telescope that provides high signal-to-noise
observations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with the objective to increase the
sensitivity of detecting low-frequency gravitational waves. As part of this
endeavor we have developed a software correlator and beamformer which enables
the formation of a tied-array beam from the raw voltages from each of
telescopes. We explain the concepts and techniques involved in the process of
adding the raw voltages coherently. We further present the software processing
pipeline that is specifically designed to deal with data from widely spaced,
inhomogeneous radio telescopes and describe the steps involved in preparing,
correlating and creating the tied-array beam. This includes polarization
calibration, bandpass correction, frequency dependent phase correction,
interference mitigation and pulsar gating. A link is provided where the
software can be obtained.

Common key elements for success are identified: data sharing should be science

mandatory but challenging; sharing of applications should accompany data
sharing. Incentives such as journal and funding agency requirements are also
similar. For all, it also appears that social aspects are more challenging than
technological ones. Governance is more diverse, and linked to the discipline
organization. CODATA, the RDA and the WDS can facilitate the establishment of
disciplinary interoperability frameworks. Being problem-driven is also a key
factor of success for building bridges to enable interdisciplinary research.

to conduct a homogeneous study of young B type stars in the cluster NGC 2264
using photometric time series from space in combination with high-resolution
spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry obtained from the ground. The latter will
be presented in a separate follow-up article. We performed frequency analyses
for eleven B stars in the field of the young cluster NGC 2264 using photometric
time series from the MOST, CoRoT and Spitzer space telescopes and the routines
Period04 and SigSpec. We employ the MESA stellar evolution code in combination
with the oscillation code GYRE to identify the pulsation modes for two SPB
stars which exhibit short period spacing series. From our analysis we identify
four objects that show SPB pulsations, five stars that show rotational
modulation of their light curves caused by spots, one star that is identified
to be a binary, and one object in the field of the cluster that is found to be
a non-member Be star. In two SPB stars we detect a number of regularly spaced
pulsation modes that are compatible with being members of a g mode period
series. Despite NGC 2264's young age, our analysis illustrates that its B type
members have already arrived on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Our

viscosity are related to the local cage rigidity. This approach can be extended
down to the atomic-level in terms of the interatomic interaction, or potential
of mean-force. We applied this approach to both real metallic glass-formers and
model Lennard-Jones glasses. The main outcome of this analysis is that in
metallic glasses the thermal expansion contribution is mostly independent of
composition and is uncorrelated with the interatomic repulsion: as a
consequence, the fragility increases upon increasing the interatomic repulsion
steepness. In the Lennard-Jones glasses, the scenario is opposite: thermal
expansion and interatomic repulsion contributions are strongly correlated, and
the fragility decreases upon increasing the repulsion steepness. This framework
allows one to tell apart systems where ""soft atoms make strong glasses"" from
those where, instead, ""soft atoms make fragile glasses"". Hence, it opens up the
way for the rational, atomistic tuning of the fragility and viscosity of widely
different glass-forming materials all the way from strong to fragile.

afterglow emission can help to discriminate between plausible theoretical
models of GRB production. Here we present an overview of the afterglow and
prompt-afterglow two parameter relations, their physical interpretations, their
use as redshift estimators and as possible cosmological tools. A similar task
has already been correctly achieved for Supernovae (SNe) Ia by using the peak
magnitude-stretch relation, known in the literature as the Phillips relation
\citep{phillips93}. The challenge today is to make GRBs, which are amongst the
farthest objects ever observed, standardizable candles as the SNe Ia through
well established and robust relations. Thus, the study of relations amongst the
observable and physical properties of GRBs is highly relevant together with
selection biases in their physical quantities. Therefore, we describe the state
of the art of the existing GRB relations, their possible and debated
interpretations in view of the current theoretical models and how relations are
corrected for selection biases. We conclude that only after an appropriate
evaluation and correction for selection effects can GRB relations be used to
discriminate among the theoretical models responsible for the prompt and

experimental nuclear and particle physics. Boron-loaded scintillators are
particularly useful for detecting neutron captures, due to the high thermal
neutron capture cross section of $^{10}$B. These scintillators are commonly
used in neutron detectors, including the DarkSide-50 neutron veto, where the
neutron may produce a signal when it scatters off protons in the scintillator
or when it captures on $^{10}$B. Reconstructing the energy of these recoils is
complicated by scintillation quenching. Understanding how nuclear recoils are
quenched in these scintillators is an important and difficult problem. In this
article, we present a set of measurements of neutron-induced proton recoils in
a boron-loaded organic liquid scintillator at recoil energies ranging from
57--467 keV, and we compare these measurements to predictions from different
quenching models. We find that a modified Birks' model whose denominator is
quadratic in $dE/dx$ best describes the measurements, with $\chi^2$/NDF$=1.6$.
This result will help model nuclear recoil scintillation in similar detectors
and can be used to improve their neutron tagging efficiency.

and biological sciences using synchrotron radiation, XFELs, high harmonic
generation, electrons and optical lasers. One of CDI's important applications
is to probe dynamic phenomena with high spatio-temporal resolution. Here, we
report the development of a general in situ CDI method for real-time imaging of
dynamic processes in solution. By introducing a time-invariant overlapping
region as a real-space constraint, we show that in situ CDI can simultaneously
reconstruct a time series of the complex exit wave of dynamic processes with
robust and fast convergence. We validate this method using numerical
simulations with coherent X-rays and performing experiments on a materials
science and a biological specimen in solution with an optical laser. Our
numerical simulations further indicate that in situ CDI can potentially reduce
the radiation dose by more than an order of magnitude relative to conventional
CDI. As coherent X-rays are under rapid development worldwide, we expect in
situ CDI could be applied to probe dynamic phenomena ranging from
electrochemistry, structural phase transitions, charge transfer, transport,
crystal nucleation, melting and fluid dynamics to biological imaging.

  of viscous fluids. Continuum Mech. Thermodyn. 29 (2), 611-623 (2017)",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The onset of turbulence in laminar flow of viscous fluids is shown to be a
consequence of the limited capacity of the fluid to withstand shear stress.
This fact is exploited to predict the flow velocity at which laminar flow
becomes turbulent and to calculate, on a theoretical basis, the corresponding
critical value of the Reynolds number. A constitutive property essential to the
present analysis is the ultimate shear stress of the fluid. The paper shows how
this stress can be determined experimentally from a test in plane Couette flow.
For water at 20 {\deg}C, the value of the ultimate shear stress is calculated
from the experiments reported in the literature. This value is then is employed
to predict the Reynolds number corresponding to the onset of turbulence in
Taylor-Couette flow and in pipe flow of circular cross section. The results are
realistic and their significance is assessed critically. The procedure can be
applied to predict the onset of turbulence in any non-turbulent flow, provided
that the velocity field of the flow is known.

that the algebraic variables of the VSC MT-HVDC are adjusted simultaneously.
The proposed method also maintains the number of equations and the dimension of

shear behaviors of liquid films at nanometer scale by the atomic force
microscope (AFM) measurement. We carry out all-atom contact-mode AFM
simulations in a liquid-vapor molecular dynamics ensemble to investigate the
solvation force oscillation and squeeze out mechanisms of a confined linear
dodecane fluid between a gold AFM tip and a mica substrate. Solvation force
oscillations are found to be associated with the layering transition of liquid
film and unstable jumps of AFM tip position. Detailed structural analyses and
molecular animations show that the local permeation of chain molecules and the
squeeze out of molecules near the edge of contact promote the layering
transition under compression. The confinement-induced slow down dynamics is
manifested by the decrease in diffusivity and increase in rotational relaxation
times. However, the persistent diffusive behavior of dodecane chain molecules
even in the single-monolayer film is attributed to the chain sliding motions,
given the fact that substantial vacancy space exists in the film due to thermal
fluctuations.

this research we have mined and analyzed StackExchange and GitHub data for
creating meaningful predictions about information technologies. Initially
StackExchange and GitHub data were imported into local data repositories. After
the data is imported, cleaning and preprocessing techniques like tokenization,
stemming and dimensionality reduction are applied to data. After preprocessing
and cleaning keywords, their relations are extracted from data. Using those
keywords data, four main knowledge areas and their variations, i.e., 20
Programming Languages, 8 Database Applications, 4 Cloud Services and 3 Mobile
Operating Systems, are selected for analysis of their trends. After the
keywords are selected, extracted patterns are used for cluster analysis in
Gephi. Produced graphs are used for the exploratory analysis of the programming
languages data. After exploratory analysis, time series of usage are created
for selected keywords. Those times series are used as training and testing data
for forecasts created using R forecast library. After making forecasts, their
accuracy are tested using Mean Magnitude of Relative Error and Median Magnitude
of Relative Error.

  Cu$_{1-x}$K$_x$InSe$_2$ solar cells",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To advance knowledge of K bonding in Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS) photovoltaic
(PV) absorbers, recent Cu-K-In-Se phase growth studies have been extended to PV
performance. First, the effect of distributing K throughout bulk Cu1-xKxInSe2
absorbers at low K/(K+Cu) compositions (0 <= x <= 0.30) was studied.
Efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were greatly
enhanced for x ~ 0.07, resulting in an officially-measured 15.0%-efficient
solar cell, matching to the world record CuInSe2 efficiency. The improvements
were a result of reduced interface and bulk recombination, relative to CuInSe2
(x ~ 0). However, higher x compositions had reduced efficiency, short-circuit
current density (JSC), and FF due to greatly increased interface recombination,
relative to the x ~ 0 baseline. Next, the effect of confining K at the
absorber/buffer interface at high K/(K+Cu) compositions (0.30 <= x <= 0.92) was
researched. Previous work showed that these surface layer growth conditions
produced CuInSe2 with a large phase fraction of KInSe2. After optimization (75
nm surface layer with x ~ 0.41), these KInSe2 surface samples exhibited
increased efficiency (officially 14.9%), VOC, and FF as a result of decreased
interface recombination. The KInSe2 surfaces had features similar to previous
reports for KF post-deposition treatments (PDTs) used in world record CIGS
solar cells-taken as indirect evidence that KInSe2 can form during these PDTs.
Both the bulk and surface growth processes greatly reduced interface
recombination. However, the KInSe2 surface had higher K levels near the
surface, greater lifetimes, and increased inversion near the buffer interface,
relative to the champion bulk CKIS absorber. These characteristics demonstrate
that K may benefit PV performance by different mechanisms at the surface and in
the absorber bulk.

solar cells were investigated: Cu1-xKxIn1-yGaySe2 absorbers with low K content
(K/(K+Cu), or x ~ 0.07) distributed throughout the bulk, and CuIn1-yGaySe2
absorbers with KIn1-yGaySe2 grown on their surfaces. For the Ga-free case,
increased temperature improved PV performance in the KInSe2 surface absorbers,
but not in the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers. Growth temperature also increased
KInSe2 phase fraction, relative to Cu1-xKxInSe2 alloys-evidence that surface
KInSe2 improved performance more than bulk KInSe2. Surface KIn1-yGaySe2 and
bulk x ~ 0.07 Cu1-xKxIn1-yGaySe2 films with Ga/(Ga+In), or y of 0.3 and 0.5
also had improved efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF),
relative to CuIn1-yGaySe2 baselines. On the other hand, y ~ 1 absorbers did not
benefit from K introduction. Similar to Cu1-xKxInSe2, the formation of
Cu1-xKxGaSe2 alloys was favored at low temperatures and high substrate Na
content, relative to the formation of mixed-phase CuGaSe2 + KGaSe2.
KIn1-yGaySe2 alloys were grown for the first time, as evidenced by X-ray
diffraction and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. For all Ga/(Ga+In)
compositions, the surface KIn1-yGaySe2 absorbers had superior PV performance in
buffered and buffer-free devices. However, the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers only
outperformed the baselines in buffered devices. The data demonstrate that
KIn1-yGaySe2 passivates the surface of CuIn1-yGaySe2 to increase efficiency,
VOC, and FF, while bulk Cu1-xKxIn1-yGaySe2 absorbers with x ~ 0.07 enhance
efficiency, VOC, and FF by some other mechanism.
