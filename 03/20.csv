neighbourhood, i.e. small cloud cores within one kiloparsec. We aim at
determining the physical parameters of the cores, i.e., temperature, volume
density, column density and (radial) velocity fields, and the status of star
formation, i.e., whether embedded objects are present within the cores.
Surveying small dark clouds in both celestial hemispheres we study the physical
conditions of low-mass star formation for detectable core masses M>0.01Msun.
The target list is drawn from catalogues of optically selected dark cloud
cores, where the visual extinction exceeds 5 magnitudes. The selected probe is
the CS molecule that needs high densities for excitation of its rotational
levels. To gauge the state of excitation, the cores were observed in two
transitions. In a limited number of cases, optical depths were derived from
complementing lines of the rarer isotopologue C34S for the (2-1) and (3-2)
transitions. Making small (3arcmin by 3arcmin) maps, the 471 optically selected
cores were searched for CS(2-1) and 315 (67%) were detected (T_A*>3sigma). In
general, the position of peak CS emission does not coincide with the optically
determined centre of the cores. The cores appear cold (T<10K) and, in the
majority of cases, the CS emission is optically thin (tau<1). On the arcminute
scales of the observations, the median column density of carbon monosulfide is
N(CS)=7.E12/cm2. For an average abundance of N(CS)/N(H2)=1.E-8, the median mass
of the detected cores is 1.0Msun. The line shapes are most often Gaussian with
widths exceeding that due to thermal broadening of <0.1km/s. The observed
median FWHM=0.7km/s, i.e. non-thermal turbulence contributes dominantly to the
line widths

element approximation of diffusion equations on general anisotropic meshes is
investigated. Bounds are established for the condition number of the resulting
linear system with and without diagonal preconditioning for the implicit Euler
and general implicit RK methods. Two solution strategies are considered for the
linear system resulting from general implicit RK integration: the simultaneous
solution (the system is solved as a whole) and a successive solution which
follows the commonly used implementation of implicit RK methods to first
transform the system into smaller systems using the Jordan normal form of the
RK matrix and then solve them successively.
  For the simultaneous solution in case of a positive semidefinite symmetric
part of the RK coefficient matrix and for the successive solution it is shown
that . If the smallest eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the RK coefficient
matrix is negative and the simultaneous solution strategy is used, an upper
bound on the time step is given so that the system matrix is positive definite.
  The obtained bounds for the condition number have explicit geometric
interpretations and take the interplay between the diffusion matrix and the
mesh geometry into full consideration. They show that there are three
mesh-dependent factors that can affect the conditioning: the number of
elements, the mesh nonuniformity measured in the Euclidean metric, and the mesh
nonuniformity with respect to the inverse of the diffusion matrix. They also
reveal that the preconditioning using the diagonal of the system matrix, the
mass matrix, or the lumped mass matrix can effectively eliminate the effects of
the mesh nonuniformity measured in the Euclidean metric. Numerical examples are
given.

potential for the development of advanced aerated materials. In this paper we
study the rheological behavior of liquid foams loaded with granular
suspensions. We focus on the effect of small particles, i.e. particle-to-bubble
size ratio smaller than 0.1, and we measure the complex modulus as a function
of particle size and particle volume fraction. With respect to previous work,
the results highlight a new elastic regime characterized by unequaled modulus
values as well as independence of size ratio. A careful investigation of the
material microstructure reveals that particles organize through the network
between the gas bubbles and form a granular skeleton structure with tightly
packed particles. The latter is proven to be responsible for the reported new
elastic regime. Rheological probing performed by strain sweep reveals a
two-step yielding of the material: the first one occurs at small strain and is
clearly attributed to yielding of the granular skeleton; the second one
corresponds to the yielding of the bubble assembly, as observed for
particle-free foams. Moreover the elastic modulus measured at small strain is
quantitatively described by models for solid foams in assuming that the
granular skeleton possesses a bulk elastic modulus of order 100 kPa. Additional
rheology experiments performed on the bulk granular material indicate that this
surprisingly high value can be understood as soon as the magnitude of the
confinement pressure exerted by foam bubbles on packed grains is considered.

case left open since the work of Leray in 1933. The reason is that due to the
absence of boundaries the local behavior of the solutions cannot be controlled
by the enstrophy in two dimensions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing
approximate weak solutions having a prescribed mean velocity on some given
bounded set. As a corollary, we obtain infinitely many weak solutions in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ parameterized by this mean velocity, which is reminiscent of the
expected convergence of the velocity field at large distances to any prescribed
constant vector field. This explicit parameterization of the weak solutions
allows us to prove a weak-strong uniqueness theorem for small data. The
question of the asymptotic behavior of the weak solutions remains however open,
when the uniqueness theorem doesn't apply.

tensile strain enhances the band gap (from 0.630 eV at zero strain to 0.802 eV
at 5% strain) while the magnetic moment of the embedded Mn atom is preserved.
The electronic and magnetic properties of the Mn-C6N6 systems are maintained up
to 10 V/nm in electric field strength. We also explore the geometries,
electronic and magnetic properties of Mn-C6N6 with adsorbed atoms and
molecules. The Mn-C6N6 with adsorbed O atom and O2 molecule systems shows
half-metallic character whereas the remaining systems preserve their
semiconducting property. The total magnetic moment per unit cell in most of the

reduction in magnetic moment can be related to the strong interactions among
the Mn atom and the surrounding atoms which lead to the formation of low-spin

physical solution. We show that this rich functional structure is directly
related to the divergence of certain classes of (irreducible vertex) diagrams,
with important consequences for traditional many-body physics based on
diagrammatic expansions. Physically, we ascribe the onset of these highly
non-perturbative manifestations to the progressive suppression of the charge
susceptibility induced by the formation of local magnetic moments and/or RVB
states in strongly correlated electron systems.

and EEG signals recorded simultaneously in 19 different locations of the brain.
The recorded EEG signals were noise cleaned and subjected to Multifractal

frequency range. Thus, we obtained the complexity values (in the form of
multifractal spectral width) in alpha, theta and gamma EEG rhythms

density functional theory calculations. The detachment reaction of the metal
centre of the porphyrin is investigated both in the gas phase and for molecules
adsorbed on the GNR. As most metal porphyrins are very stable against this
reaction, it is found that these molecules bind only weakly to a perfect
nanoribbon. However, interaction with a single-atom vacancy in the GNR results
in chemical bonding by the transition metal centre being shared between
nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin ring and the carbon atoms next to the vacancy
in the GNR. For both the physisorbed and the chemisorbed geometry, the
inclusion of van der Waals interaction results in a significant enlargement of
the binding energy and reduction of the adsorption height. Electronic transport
calculations using non-equilibrium Greens functions show that the conductivity
of the GNR is altered by the chemisorbed porphyrin molecules. Since the metal
centers of porphyrins carry an element-specific magnetic moment, not only the
net conductance, but also the spin-dependent conductance of the GNR is
affected. In particular, the adsorption of Ru-porphyrin on the single-atom
vacancy results in a very large spin polarization of the current of 88% at
small applied source-drain voltages. Based on our results, we suggest that a
spin valve constructed from a GNR with ferromagnetic contacts could be used as
a sensitive detector that could discriminate between various metal porphyrins.

stress front that propagates in the same direction as the Schallamach wave,
while the separation pulse involves local interface detachment and travels in
the opposite direction. Transitions between these stick-slip modes are easily
effected by changing the sliding velocity or normal load. The properties of
these three waves, and their relation to stick-slip is elucidated. We also

relevance and its position on the results page. The position based model
explains this behavior by ascribing to every item an attraction probability,
and to every position an examination probability. To be clicked, a result must
be both attractive and examined. The probabilities of an item-position pair
being clicked thus form the entries of a rank-$1$ matrix. We propose the
learning problem of a Bernoulli rank-$1$ bandit where at each step, the
learning agent chooses a pair of row and column arms, and receives the product
of their Bernoulli-distributed values as a reward. This is a special case of
the stochastic rank-$1$ bandit problem considered in recent work that proposed
an elimination based algorithm Rank1Elim, and showed that Rank1Elim's regret
scales linearly with the number of rows and columns on ""benign"" instances.
These are the instances where the minimum of the average row and column rewards
$\mu$ is bounded away from zero. The issue with Rank1Elim is that it fails to
be competitive with straightforward bandit strategies as $\mu \rightarrow 0$.
In this paper we propose Rank1ElimKL which simply replaces the (crude)
confidence intervals of Rank1Elim with confidence intervals based on
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, and with the help of a novel result
concerning the scaling of KL divergences we prove that with this change, our
algorithm will be competitive no matter the value of $\mu$. Experiments with
synthetic data confirm that on benign instances the performance of Rank1ElimKL
is significantly better than that of even Rank1Elim, while experiments with
models derived from real data confirm that the improvements are significant
across the board, regardless of whether the data is benign or not.

the X40 set of dimers of small halogenated molecules, using wavefunction-based

Hybrid-vdW-DF2 offers a slight improvement over standard vdW-DF2. Similar

well for binding involving the strongly polar hydrogen halides, but poorly for

important features of holographic duality. A tensor network is usually defined
for a fixed graph geometry specified by the connection of tensors. In this
paper, we generalize the random tensor network approach to allow quantum
superposition of different spatial geometries. We set up a framework in which
all possible bulk spatial geometries, characterized by weighted adjacent
matrices of all possible graphs, are mapped to the boundary Hilbert space and
form an overcomplete basis of the boundary. We name such an overcomplete basis
as holographic coherent states. A generic boundary state can be expanded on
this basis, which describes the state as a superposition of different spatial
geometries in the bulk. We discuss how to define distinct classical geometries
and small fluctuations around them. We show that small fluctuations around
classical geometries define ""code subspaces"" which are mapped to the boundary
Hilbert space isometrically with quantum error correction properties. In
addition, we also show that the overlap between different geometries is
suppressed exponentially as a function of the geometrical difference between
the two geometries. The geometrical difference is measured in an area law
fashion, which is a manifestation of the holographic nature of the states
considered.

binary selection function g, which determines if the classifier abstains from
prediction, or uses f to predict. The classifier is called
pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best
classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain.
The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined
to be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A ""fast"" rejection rate is
achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by O(1/m) where m is the
number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and O hides
logarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are
intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that
in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called
Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the
well-known CAL active algorithm.
  We focus on the agnostic setting, for which there is a known algorithm called
LESS that learns a PCS classifier and achieves a fast rejection rate (depending
on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) under strong assumptions. We present an
improved PCS learning algorithm called ILESS for which we show a fast rate

$K$, is large. Analytical results show that, using coded caching and wireless
multicasting, without channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT),
linear scaling of the content delivery rate with respect to $K$ can be achieved
in some different ways. First, if the multicast transmission spans over $L$
independent sub-channels, e.g., in quasi-static fading if $L = 1$, and in block
fading or multi-carrier systems if $L>1$, linear scaling can be obtained when
the product of the number of transmit antennas and the number of sub-channels
scales logarithmically with $K$. Second, even with a fixed number of antennas,
we can achieve the linear scaling with a threshold-based user selection
requiring only one-bit feedbacks from the users. When CSIT is available, we
propose a mixed strategy that combines spatial multiplexing and multicasting.
Numerical results show that, by optimizing the power split between spatial
multiplexing and multicasting, we can achieve a significant gain of the content

Bedrock, a minimalistic Stratum extension that protects the privacy and

in terms of some physical entity in cooperative communications. Our setting is
a secret two-way communication channel where two transmitters exchange
information in the presence of an eavesdropper. The relays are selected from a
set of interested parties such that the secrecy sum rate is maximized. In
return, the selected relay nodes' energy harvesting requirements will be
fulfilled up to a certain threshold through their own payoff so that they have
the natural incentive to be selected and involved in the communication.
However, relays may exaggerate their private information in order to improve
their chance to be selected. Our objective is to develop a mechanism for relay
selection that enforces them to reveal the truth since otherwise they may be
penalized. We also propose a joint cooperative relay beamforming and transmit
power optimization scheme based on an alternating optimization approach. Note
that the problem is highly non-convex since the objective function appears as a
product of three correlated Rayleigh quotients. While a common practice in the
existing literature is to optimize the relay beamforming vector for given
transmit power via rank relaxation, we propose a second-order cone programming
(SOCP)-based approach in this paper which requires a significantly lower
computational task. The performance of the incentive control mechanism and the
optimization algorithm has been evaluated through numerical simulations.

Barycentric refinement G1 of a simplicial complex G. K(x) is dual to
(-1)^dim(x) for which Gauss-Bonnet is the definition of Euler characteristic X.
Because the connection Laplacian L'=1+A' of G is unimodular, where A' is the
adjacency matrix of of the connection graph G', the Green function values
g(x,y) = (1+A')^-1_xy are integers and 1-X(S(x))=g(x,x). Gauss-Bonnet for K^+
reads therefore as str(g)=X(G), where str is the super trace. As g is a
time-discrete heat kernel, this is a cousin to McKean-Singer str(exp(-Lt)) =
X(G) for the Hodge Laplacian L=dd^* +d^*d which lives on the same Hilbert space
than L'. Both formulas hold for an arbitrary finite abstract simplicial complex
G. Writing V_x(y)= g(x,y) for the Newtonian potential of the connection
Laplacian, we prove sum_y V_x(y) = K(x), so that by the new Gauss-Bonnet
formula, the Euler characteristic of G agrees with the total potential
theoretic energy sum_x,y g(x,y)=X(G) of G. The curvature K now relates to the
probability measure p minimizing the internal energy U(p)=sum_x,y g(x,y) p(x)
p(y) of the complex. Since both the internal energy (here linked to topology)
and Shannon entropy are natural and unique in classes of functionals, we then
look at critical points p the Helmholtz free energy F(p)=(1-T) U(p)-T S(p)
which combines the energy functional U and the entropy functional S(p)=-sum_x
p(x) log(p(x)). As the temperature T changes, we observe bifurcation phenomena.
Already for G=K_3 both a saddle node bifurcation and a pitchfork bifurcation
occurs. The saddle node bifurcation leads to a catastrophe: the function T ->
F(p(T),T) is discontinuous if p(T) is a free energy minimizer.

Five NH$_3$ inversion lines and the 1.3 cm continuum are observed with the Karl

with single-dish data. We find that the CH$_3$OH, SO, and HNCO lines, which are
usually shock tracers, are better correlated spatially with the compact dust
emission from dense cores among the detected lines. These lines also show
enhancement in intensities with respect to SiO intensities toward the compact
dust emission, suggesting the presence of slow shocks or hot cores in these
regions. We find gas temperatures of $\gtrsim$100 K at 0.1-pc scales based on
RADEX modelling of the H$_2$CO and NH$_3$ lines. Although no strong
correlations between temperatures and linewidths/H$_2$O maser luminosities are
found, in high-angular-resolution maps we notice several candidate shock heated

produced by a first-order electroweak phase transition in the regime of extreme

signifies the completion of the transition, $T_p$, can be as low as a few MeV
(nucleosynthesis temperature), while most of the true vacuum bubbles are formed
much earlier at the nucleation temperature, $T_n\sim 50$ GeV. This implies that
the gravitational wave spectrum is mainly produced by the collisions of large
bubbles and characterised by a large amplitude and a peak frequency as low as
$f \sim 10^{-9}-10^{-7}$ Hz. We show that such a scenario can occur in (but not
limited to) a model based on a non-linear realisation of the electroweak gauge
group, such that the Higgs vacuum configuration is altered by a cubic coupling.
In order to carefully quantify the evolution of the phase transition of this
model over such a wide temperature range, we go beyond the usual fast
transition approximation, taking into account the expansion of the Universe as
well as the behaviour of the nucleation probability at low temperatures. Our
computation shows that there exists a range of parameters for which the

further performance gains. Here we build a model describing the essential
features of a large array of turbines with arbitrary design and layout, by
considering a fully-developed wind farm whose upper edge is bounded by a
self-similar boundary layer. The exchanges between the wind farm, the
overlaying boundary layer, and the outer flow are parameterized by means of the
classical entrainment hypothesis. We obtain a concise expression for the wind
farm's power density (corresponding to power output per unit planform area), as
a function of three coefficients, which represent the array thrust and the
turbulent exchanges at each of the two interfaces. We assess the performance of
our model by comparing the predicted power density to field data, laboratory
measurements and large-eddy simulations for the fully-developed regions of wind
farms, finding good agreement. We extend our model to include the effect of
atmospheric stability on power output, by using an established parameterization
relating entrainment coefficients to local Froude numbers. Our predictions for
power variation with atmospheric stability are in broad agreement with field
measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first
quantitative comparison between an atmospheric-stability-dependent model and
field data. Finally, we consider an ideal limit for array operation, whereby
turbines are designed to maximize momentum exchange with the overlying boundary
layer. This enables us to obtain an upper bound for the performance of large
wind farms, which we determine to be an order of magnitude larger than the
output of contemporary turbine arrays.

noticeable advantage of the proposed test is that the number of communities can
be allowed to grow linearly with the number of nodes ignoring a logarithmic

distribution to a Gumbel distribution, and we show that both the number of
communities and the membership vector can be tested via the proposed method.
Further, we show that the proposed test has asymptotic power guarantee against
a class of alternatives. We also demonstrate that the proposed method can be
extended to the degree-corrected stochastic block model. Both simulation

tools apply universally when the following random vectors are jointly
asymptotically multivariate Gaussian: 1. the vector composed of each model's
quality value evaluated under certain model selection criteria (e.g.
cross-validation errors across folds, AIC, prediction errors etc.) 2. the test
statistics from which we make inference on the parameters; it is worth noting
that the parameters here are chosen after model selection methods are
performed. Under these assumptions, we derive a pivotal quantity that has an
asymptotically Unif(0,1) distribution which can be used to perform tests and
construct confidence intervals. Both the tests and confidence intervals are
selectively valid for the chosen parameter. While the above assumptions may not
be satisfied in some applications, we propose a novel variation to these model
selection procedures by adding Gaussian randomizations to either one of the two
vectors. As a result, the joint distribution of the above random vectors is
multivariate Gaussian and our general tools apply. We illustrate our method by
applying it to four important procedures for which very few selective inference
results have been developed: cross-validated Lasso, cross-validated randomized
Lasso, AIC-based model selection among a fixed set of models and inference for
a newly introduced novel marginal LOCO parameter, inspired by the LOCO
parameter of Rinaldo et al (2016); and we provide complete results for these
cases. For randomized model selection procedures, we develop Markov chain Monte

However, it is noticed that there might be two magnetic dips, and hence two
threads, along one magnetic field line. Following the previous work, we intend
to investigate the kinematics of the filament longitudinal oscillations when
two threads are magnetically connected, which is done by solving
one-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic equations with the numerical code
MPI-AMRVAC. Two different types of perturbations are considered, and the
difference from previous works resulting from the filament thread-thread
interaction is investigated. We find that even with the inclusion of the
thread-thread interaction, the oscillation period is modified weakly, by at
most 20% compared to the traditional pendulum model with one thread. However,
the damping timescale is significantly affected by the thread-thread
interaction. Hence, we should take it into account when applying the consistent
seismology to the filaments where two threads are magnetically connected.

updating existing knowledge or beliefs with new incoming evidence. Bayes
conditioning is the primary mechanism in use for belief revision in data fusion
systems that use probabilistic inference. However, traditional conditioning
methods face several challenges due to inherent data/source imperfections in
big-data environments that harness soft (i.e., human or human-based) sources in
addition to hard (i.e., physics-based) sensors. The objective of this paper is
to investigate the most natural extension of Bayes conditioning that is
suitable for evidence updating in the presence of such uncertainties. By
viewing the evidence updating process as a thought experiment, an elegant
strategy is derived for robust evidence updating in the presence of extreme
uncertainties that are characteristic of big-data environments. In particular,
utilizing the Fagin-Halpern conditional notions, a natural extension to Bayes
conditioning is derived for evidence that takes the form of a general belief
function. The presented work differs fundamentally from the Conditional Update

$\log f = -2.0 \log z + {\rm const}$. When the subclasses are considered, we
find that stationary jets are perhaps dominant in low synchrotron peaked

the network at regular intervals with so-called originator messages.
  This paper describes in detail a formalisation of the B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol.
This exercise revealed several ambiguities and inconsistencies in the RFC. We
developed two models. The first implements, if possible, a literal reading of

The alternative model is in some places less restrictive, and rebroadcasts more
often when it helps route discovery, and will on the other hand drop more
messages that might interfere with the process.
  We verify for a basic untimed model that both interpretations ensure
loop-freedom, bidirectional link discovery, and route-discovery. We use
simulation of a timed model to compare the performance and found that both
models are comparable when it comes to the time and number of messages needed
for discovering routes. However, the alternative model identifies a
significantly lower number of suboptimal routes, and thus improves on the

a hybrid system consisting of a fluorescent nanodiamond and a gold nanoparticle
was assembled step-by-step for in situ optical measurements. We found that the
emission from the nanoparticle increased compared with that before coupling.
The interaction between plasmonic nanostructures and fluorescent emitter was
understood as an entity based on the concept of a quantized optical cavity by
considering the nanodiamond and the nanoparticle as a two-level energy system
and a nanoresonator, respectively. The theoretical calculations reveal that
both the plasmonic coupling effect and the dielectric nanoantenna effect
contribute to the enhancement of light emission from the gold nanoparticles.

modulate FRB amplitudes for a wide range of distances, including the $\sim $
Gpc distance of the repeater FRB121102. To produce caustics, the lens'
dispersion-measure depth (${\rm DM}_{\ell}$), scale size ($a$), and distance
from the source ($d_{\rm sl}$) must satisfy ${\rm DM}_{\ell} d_{\rm sl} / a^2
\gtrsim 0.65~ {\rm pc^2 \ AU^{-2} \ cm^{-3}}$. Caustics produce strong
magnifications ($\lesssim 10^2$) on short time scales ($\sim$ hours to days and
perhaps shorter) along with narrow, epoch dependent spectral peaks (0.1 to
1~GHz). However, strong suppression also occurs in long-duration ($\sim$
months) troughs. For geometries that produce multiple images, the resulting
burst components will arrive differentially by $< 1~\mu$s to tens of ms and
they will show different apparent dispersion measures, $\delta{\rm DM}_{\rm
apparent} \sim 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Arrival time perturbations may mask any
underlying periodicity with period $\lesssim 1$ s. When arrival times differ by
less than the burst width, interference effects in dynamic spectra are
expected. Strong lensing requires source sizes smaller than $({\rm
Fresnel~scale)^2} / a$, which can be satisfied by compact objects such as
neutron star magnetospheres but not by AGNs. Much of the phenomenology of the
repeating fast radio burst source FRB121102 is similar to lensing effects. The
overall picture can be tested by obtaining wideband spectra of bursts (from
$<1$ to 10 GHz and possibly higher), which can also be used to characterize the
plasma environment near FRB sources. A rich variety of phenomena is expected
from an ensemble of lenses near the FRB source. We discuss constraints on
densities, magnetic fields, and locations of plasma lenses related to
requirements for lensing to occur.

The data are compatible with a constant period derivative: $\dot{P}=-29 \pm 3$
ms yr$^{-1}$ and $P/\dot{P}= 3.2$ Myr. However, it is difficult to tell whether
we have observed orbital decay, or a portion of a 14-year apsidal precession
cycle. If interpreted as decay, the star's tidal quality parameter $Q_\star$ is
about $2\times 10^5$. If interpreted as precession, the planet's Love number is
$0.44\pm 0.10$. Orbital decay appears to be the more parsimonious model: it is
favored by $\Delta\chi^2=5.5$ despite having two fewer free parameters than the
precession model. The decay model implies that WASP-12 was discovered within
the final $\sim$0.2% of its existence, which is an unlikely coincidence but
harmonizes with independent evidence that the planet is nearing disruption.
Precession does not invoke any temporal coincidence, but does require some
mechanism to maintain an eccentricity of $\approx$0.002 in the face of rapid
tidal circularization. To distinguish unequivocally between decay and
precession will probably require a few more years of monitoring. Particularly
helpful will be occultation timing in 2019 and thereafter.

dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use
deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents
end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.
  We demonstrate two experimental results.
  First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show
results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded
vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find
that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain
symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style).
Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among
'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.
  Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset,
where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned'
agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to
ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative
dialog and a better team.

modelling techniques for the design and development of software systems. With
the increasing complexity and utilization of today's software systems, FESCA
aims at addressing two research questions: (1) what role is played by the

an oceanic current is insensitive to the wind stress strength. Baroclinicity is
currently believed to be key to the development of an eddy-saturated state. In
this paper, it is shown that eddy saturation can also occur in a purely
barotropic flow over topography, without baroclinicity. Thus, eddy saturation
is a fundamental property of barotropic dynamics above topography. It is
demonstrated that the main factor controlling the appearance or not of
eddy-saturated states in the barotropic setting is the structure of geostrophic
contours, that is the contours of $f/H$ of the ratio of the Coriolis parameter
to the ocean's depth. Eddy-saturated states occur when the geostrophic contours
are open, that is when the geostrophic contours span the whole zonal extent of
the domain. This minimal requirement for eddy-saturated states is demonstrated
using numerical integrations of a single-layer quasi-geostrophic flow over two
different topographies characterized by either open or closed geostrophic
contours with parameter values loosely inspired by the Southern Ocean. In this
setting, transient eddies are produced through a barotropic-topographic
instability that occurs due tot the interaction of the large-scale zonal flow
with the topography. Through the study of this barotropic-topographic
instability insight is gained on how eddy-saturated states are established.

($\pi, 0$). Secondly, anisotropy in the excitations around ($\pi, 0$) with an
elliptical shape grows on moving towards the hole-doped region for low energy,
whereas it decreases for the high-energy excitations on the contrary. Thirdly,
spin-wave spectral weight shifts towards the low-energy region on moving away
from zero doping. We find these features to be in qualitative agreement with
the inelastic neutron-scattering measurements for the doped pnictides.

we study the theoretical properties of the dual Lasso solution, and we show
that joint consideration of the Lasso primal and its dual solutions are useful

among active predictors are not problematic, and we derive a new weaker
condition on the design matrix, called Pseudo Irrepresentable Condition (PIC).
Third, we present a new variable selection procedure, Dual Lasso Selector, and
we prove that the PIC is a necessary and sufficient condition for consistent
variable selection for the proposed method. Finally, by combining the dual
Lasso selector further with the Ridge estimation even better prediction
performance is achieved. We call the combination (DLSelect+Ridge), it can be
viewed as a new combined approach for inference in high-dimensional regression

  Errors","35 pages",,,,"stat.AP q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an efficient stock market, the returns and their time-dependent volatility
are often jointly modeled by stochastic volatility models (SVMs). Over the last
few decades several SVMs have been proposed to adequately capture the defining
features of the relationship between the return and its volatility. Among one
of the earliest SVM, Taylor (1982) proposed a hierarchical model, where the
current return is a function of the current latent volatility, which is further
modeled as an auto-regressive process. In an attempt to make the SVMs more
appropriate for complex realistic market behavior, a leverage parameter was
introduced in the Taylor SVM, which however led to the violation of the
efficient market hypothesis (EMH, a necessary mean-zero condition for the
return distribution that prevents arbitrage possibilities). Subsequently, a
host of alternative SVMs had been developed and are currently in use. In this
paper, we propose mean-corrections for several generalizations of Taylor SVM
that capture the complex market behavior as well as satisfy EMH. We also
establish a few theoretical results to characterize the key desirable features
of these models, and present comparison with other popular competitors.
Furthermore, four real-life examples (Oil price, CITI bank stock price,
Euro-USD rate, and S&P 500 index returns) have been used to demonstrate the
performance of this new class of SVMs.

optimization problem and, on the other hand, consider the problem of
interpolating a set of points with a complex exponential function. This paper
proposes a single algorithm to address both problems. It draws on the notion of
hyponormality in operator theory. Concerning optimization, it seems to be the
first algorithm that is capable of extracting global solutions from a
polynomial optimization problem where the variables and data are complex
numbers. It also applies to real polynomial optimization, a special case of
complex polynomial optimization, and thus extends the work of Henrion and
Lasserre implemented in GloptiPoly. Concerning interpolation, the algorithm
provides an alternative to Prony's method based on the Autonne-Takagi
factorization and it avoids solving a Vandermonde system. The algorithm and its
proof are based exclusively on linear algebra. They are devoid of notions from
algebraic geometry, contrary to existing methods for interpolation. The
algorithm is tested on a series of examples, each illustrating a different
facet of the approach. One of the examples demonstrates that hyponormality can
be enforced numerically to strenghten a convex relaxation and to force its
solution to have rank one.

The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is a solution to a unit-modulus

have proposed polynomial-time algorithms such as a semidefinite relaxation
(SDP) approach or the generalized power method (GPM) to solve it. Numerical
experiments suggest both of these methods succeed with high probability for
$\sigma$ up to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1/2})$, yet, existing analyses only
confirm this observation for $\sigma$ up to $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/4})$. In this
paper, we bridge the gap, by proving SDP is tight for $\sigma =
\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n /\log n})$, and GPM converges to the global optimum under
the same regime. Moreover, we establish a linear convergence rate for GPM, and
derive a tighter $\ell_\infty$ bound for the MLE. A novel technique we develop
in this paper is to track (theoretically) $n$ closely related sequences of
iterates, in addition to the sequence of iterates GPM actually produces. As a
by-product, we obtain an $\ell_\infty$ perturbation bound for leading

and degraded by heteroscedastic noise. We provide simplified expressions for
the asymptotic PCA recovery of the underlying subspace, subspace amplitudes and
subspace coefficients; the expressions enable both easy and efficient

structure of these expressions to show that, for a fixed average noise
variance, the asymptotic recovery of PCA for heteroscedastic data is always
worse than that for homoscedastic data (i.e., for noise variances that are
equal across samples). Hence, while average noise variance is often a
practically convenient measure for the overall quality of data, it gives an
overly optimistic estimate of the performance of PCA for heteroscedastic data.

stochastic geometry, we obtain the Laplace transform of the aggregate received
power at the TX to calculate the power coverage probability. We approximate and
discretize the transmit power of each TX into a finite number of discrete power
levels in log scale to compute the channel and total coverage probability. We
compare our analytical predictions to simulations and observe good accuracy.
The proposed model allows insights into effect of system parameters, such as
transmit power of PBs, PB density, main lobe beam-width and power circuit

that it is feasible and safe to power TXs in a mmWave ad hoc network using PBs.

of field massive triple stars. In this scenario, favorable conditions for the
inspiral of a black hole binary are initiated by its gravitational interaction
with a distant companion, rather than by a common-envelope phase invoked in
standard binary evolution models. We use a code that follows self-consistently
the evolution of massive triple stars, combining the secular triple dynamics
(Lidov-Kozai cycles) with stellar evolution. After a black hole triple is
formed, its dynamical evolution is computed using either the orbit-averaged
equations of motion, or a high-precision direct integrator for triples with
weaker hierarchies for which the secular perturbation theory breaks down. Most
black hole mergers in our models are produced in the latter non-secular
dynamical regime. We derive the properties of the merging binaries and compute
a black hole merger rate in the range (0.3- 1.3) Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}, or up to
~2.5Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} if the black hole orbital planes have initially random
orientation. Finally, we show that black hole mergers from the triple channel
have significantly higher eccentricities than those formed through the
evolution of massive binaries or in dense star clusters. Measured
eccentricities could therefore be used to uniquely identify binary mergers
formed through the evolution of triple stars. While our results suggest up to
~10 detections per year with Advanced-LIGO, the high eccentricities could
render the merging binaries harder to detect with planned space based
interferometers such as LISA.

that a given random rooted network can be obtained by changing the root of
another given one if and only if the distributions of the two agree on the
invariant sigma-field. Several applications of the result are presented for the
case of unimodular networks. In particular, it is shown that the distribution
of a unimodular network is uniquely determined by its restriction to the

invariant transport kernel that balances between two given (discrete) measures

where some vertices and edges are added to a unimodular network and then, to
make it unimodular, the probability measure is biased and then a new root is

unimodularizations in these situations. Finally, analogous existing results for
stationary point processes and unimodular networks are discussed in detail.

which suffices to suppress the diffusion of defects in such multi-component
anyonic liquid. This non-ergodic dynamic suggests a promising scenario for
investigation of quasi-many-body localization. Computing standard diagnostics
evidences that, in such disorder-free many-body system, a typical initial
inhomogeneity of anyons gives birth to a glassy dynamics with an exponentially
diverging time scale of the full relaxation. A by-product of this dynamical
effect is manifested by the slow growth of entanglement entropy, with
characteristic time scales bearing resemblance to those of inhomogeneity
relaxation. This setting provides a new platform which paves the way toward
impeding logical errors by self-localization of anyons in a generic, high
energy state, originated in their exotic statistics.

dynamically decouple during the hadronic rescattering until the particles are

products rescatter. Therefore the resonances, which decay in the early hadronic
phase, cannot be identified anymore by the invariant mass method. Stable and
unstable particles change their momentum distribution by more than 30$\%$

$T_{c}$ above liquid nitrogen boiling temperature since the discovery of
superconductivity. So far, the record high $T_{c}$ of about 130 K at atmosphere
pressure was reported in some multilayer Hg(Tl)-Ba-Ca-Cu-O compounds.
Meanwhile, sulfur hydride system holds the highest $T_{c}$ of around 200 K at
high pressure of about 150 GPa. While keeping these records for
superconductivity, either the toxicity of these superconductors or the
requirement of extreme pressure condition for superconductivity limits their
technology applications. Here we show that doping a chain link molecule $-$
$p$-terphenyl by potassium can bring about superconductivity at 123 K at
atmosphere pressure, which is comparable to the highest $T_{c}$ in cuprates.
The easy processability, light weight, durability of plastics, and
environmental friendliness of this kind of new superconductor have great

co-occurrences, as the latter would depend on the 'meaning connections'
existing between the concepts that are associated with these words. In that

required to explain the probabilities calculated by counting the relative
number of documents containing certain words and co-ocurrrences of words.

we exalt as the preferential attachment paradox, has remained unexplained since
the physicist Sidney Redner first made light of it over a decade ago. Here we
propose a resolution. The chief source of the mischief, we contend, lies in
Redner having relied on a measurement procedure bereft of the accuracy required
to distinguish preferential attachment from another form of attachment that is
consistent with a log-normal in-degree distribution. There was a high-accuracy
measurement procedure in use at the time, but it would have have been difficult
to use it to shed light on the paradox, due to the presence of a systematic
error inducing design flaw. In recent years the design flaw had been recognised
and corrected. We show that the bringing of the newly corrected measurement
procedure to bear on the data leads to a resolution of the paradox.

However, users are often selfish and may not be willing to cooperate without

challenging due to the users' asynchronous downloading behaviors and their

both single-object and multi-object multi-dimensional auction mechanisms,

can achieves truthfulness (i.e, truthful private information revelation) and
efficiency (i.e., social welfare maximization). Simulations with real traces
show that crowdsourced mobile streaming facilitated by the auction mechanisms
outperforms noncooperative stream ing by 48.6% (on average) in terms of social
welfare. To evaluate the real-world performance, we also construct a demo

the problem. This work studiesWSN joint time and frequency channel allocation
for a given routing tree, such that: a) allocation is performed in a fully

WSN terminals, within communication up to two hops, and b) detection of
potential interfering terminals is simplified and can be practically realized.
The algorithm imprints space, time, frequency and radio hardware constraints
into a loopy factor graph and performs iterative message passing/ loopy belief
propagation (BP) with randomized initial priors. Sufficient conditions for
convergence to a valid solution are offered, for the first time in the
literature, exploiting the structure of the proposed factor graph. Based on
theoretical findings, modifications of BP are devised that i) accelerate
convergence to a valid solution and ii) reduce computation cost. Simulations
reveal promising throughput results of the proposed distributed algorithm, even
though it utilizes simplified interfering terminals set detection. Future work
could modify the constraints such that other disruptive wireless technologies

temperature, wind speed and irradiance over China, using the GloSea5 seasonal
forecast system. Skill in such forecasts is important for the future
development of seasonal climate services for the energy sector, allowing better
estimates of forthcoming demand and renewable electricity supply. We find that
although overall the skill from the direct model output is patchy, some
high-skill regions of interest to the energy sector can be identified. In
particular, winter mean wind speed is skilfully forecast around the coast of
the South China Sea, related to skilful forecasts of the El Ni\~no--Southern
Oscillation. Such information could improve seasonal estimates of offshore wind
power generation. Similarly, forecasts of winter irradiance have good skill in
eastern central China, with possible use for solar power estimation. Much of
China shows skill in summer temperatures, which derives from an upward trend.
However, the region around Beijing retains this skill even when detrended. This
temperature skill could be helpful in managing summer energy demand. While both
the strengths and limitations of our results will need to be considered when
developing seasonal climate services in the future, the outlook for such
service development in China is promising.

evaluate the prior distribution represented by the Onsager--Machlup functional.
Through numerical experiments, this study clarifies how the prior distribution
should be incorporated into cost functions for discrete-time estimation
problems. Consistent with previous theoretical studies, the divergence of the
drift term is essential in weak-constraint 4D-Var (w4D-Var), but it is not nec
essary in Markov chain Monte Carlo with the Euler scheme. Although the former
property may cause difficulties when implementing w4D-Var in large systems,
this paper proposes a new technique for estimating the divergence term and its

gained popularity during the last years. The model has a recurrent network
named reservoir, that is fixed during the learning process. The reservoir is
used for transforming the input space in a larger space. A fundamental property
that provokes an impact on the model accuracy is the Echo State Property (ESP).
There are two main theoretical results related to the ESP. First, a sufficient
condition for the ESP existence that involves the singular values of the
reservoir matrix. Second, a necessary condition for the ESP. The ESP can be
violated according to the spectral radius value of the reservoir matrix. There
is a theoretical gap between these necessary and sufficient conditions. This
article presents an empirical analysis of the accuracy and the projections of
reservoirs that satisfy this theoretical gap. It gives some insights about the
generation of the reservoir matrix. From previous works, it is already known
that the optimal accuracy is obtained near to the border of stability control
of the dynamics. Then, according to our empirical results, we can see that this
border seems to be closer to the sufficient conditions than to the necessary
conditions of the ESP.

of frequencies and spin-wave profiles of normal modes of the dot. We study
in-plane vortices of two types: a circular magnetization in circular dots and
rings and the Landau state in square rings. We examine the influence of the
dipolar-exchange competition and the geometry of the dot on the stability of
the vortex and on the spectrum of spin waves. We show that the lowest-frequency
mode profile proves to be indicative of the dipolar-to-exchange interaction
ratio and the vortex stability is closely related to the spin-wave profile of
the soft mode. The negative dispersion relation is also shown. Our results
obtained for in-plane vortices are in qualitative agreement with results for
core-vortices obtained from experiments, micromagnetic simulations, and

experimental design, modelling, and statistical inference is increasingly
complemented by novel analysis methods, driven e.g. by machine learning
methods. While these novel approaches provide new insights into neuroimaging
data, they often have unexpected properties, generating a growing literature on
possible pitfalls. We propose to meet this challenge by adopting a habit of
systematic testing of experimental design, analysis procedures, and statistical
inference. Specifically, we suggest to apply the analysis method used for
experimental data also to aspects of the experimental design, simulated
confounds, simulated null data, and control data. We stress the importance of
keeping the analysis method the same in main and test analyses, because only
this way possible confounds and unexpected properties can be reliably detected
and avoided. We describe and discuss this Same Analysis Approach in detail, and
demonstrate it in two worked examples using multivariate decoding. With these
examples, we reveal two sources of error: A mismatch between counterbalancing
(crossover designs) and cross-validation which leads to systematic below-chance
accuracies, and linear decoding of a nonlinear effect, a difference in
variance.
  Highlights: 1. Traditional design principles can be unsuitable when combined
with cross-validation; 2. This can explain both inflated accuracies and
below-chance accuracies; 3. We propose the novel ""same analysis approach"" (SAA)
for checking analysis pipelines; 4. The principle of SAA is to perform
additional analyses using the same analysis; 5. SAA analysis should be
performed on design variables, control data, and simulations

understanding of the planet formation process, the precise determination of
stellar parameters for the ever increasing number of discovered extrasolar
planets is of great relevance. Furthermore, precise stellar parameters are
needed to fully characterize the planet properties. It is thus important to
continue the efforts to determine, in the most uniform way possible, the
parameters for stars with planets as new discoveries are announced. Aims: In
this paper we present new precise atmospheric parameters for a sample of 50
stars with planets. The results are presented in the catalogue: SWEET-Cat.
Methods: Stellar atmospheric parameters and masses for the 50 stars were
derived assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and using
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra. The methodology used is based
on the measurement of equivalent widths with ARES2 for a list of iron lines.
The line abundances were derived using MOOG. We then used the curve of growth
analysis to determine the parameters. We implemented a new minimization
procedure which significantly improves the computational time. Results: The
stellar parameters for the 50 stars are presented and compared with previously
determined literature values. For SWEET-Cat, we compile values for the
effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and stellar mass for
almost all the planet host stars listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia.
This data will be updated on a continuous basis. The data can be used for
statistical studies of the star-planet correlation, and for the derivation of
consistent properties for known planets.

surprising and sometimes counterintuitive ways. Despite strong interest,
experiments on the subject proved challenging because of the simultaneous
presence of different scattering mechanisms that suppress or obscure
consequences of e-e scattering. Only recently, sufficiently clean electron
systems with transport dominated by e-e collisions have become available,
showing behavior characteristic of highly viscous fluids. Here we study
electron transport through graphene constrictions and show that their
conductance below 150 K increases with increasing temperature, in stark
contrast to the metallic character of doped graphene. Notably, the measured
conductance exceeds the maximum conductance possible for free electrons. This
anomalous behavior is attributed to collective movement of interacting
electrons, which 'shields' individual carriers from momentum loss at sample
boundaries. The measurements allow us to identify the conductance contribution
arising due to electron viscosity and determine its temperature dependence.
Besides fundamental interest, our work shows that viscous effects can
facilitate high-mobility transport at elevated temperatures, a potentially
useful behavior for designing graphene-based devices.

two sets of d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangles. This is a common problem
that arises in many agent-based simulation studies, and is of central
importance in the context of High Level Architecture (HLA), where it is at the
core of the Data Distribution Management (DDM) service. Several realizations of
the DDM service have been proposed; however, many of them are either
inefficient or inherently sequential. These are serious limitations since
multicore processors are now ubiquitous, and DDM algorithms -- being
CPU-intensive -- could benefit from additional computing power. We propose a
parallel version of the Sort-Based Matching algorithm for shared-memory
multiprocessors. Sort-Based Matching is one of the most efficient serial
algorithms for the DDM problem, but is quite difficult to parallelize due to
data dependencies. We describe the algorithm and compute its asymptotic running
time; we complete the analysis by assessing its performance and scalability
through extensive experiments on two commodity multicore systems based on a
dual socket Intel Xeon processor, and a single socket Intel Core i7 processor.

gauge-P simulations of bosonic systems with long range interactions. In these
approaches, the quantum evolution is sampled by trajectories in phase space,
allowing calculation of correlations without truncation of the Hilbert space or
other approximations to the quantum state. The main drawback is that the
simulation time is limited by noise arising from interactions.
  We show that the long-range character of these interactions does not further
increase the limitations of these methods, in contrast to the situation for
alternatives such as the density matrix renormalisation group. Furthermore,
stochastic gauge techniques can also successfully extend simulation times in
the long-range-interaction case, by making using of parameters that affect the
noise properties of trajectories, without affecting physical observables.
  We derive essential results that significantly aid the use of these methods:
estimates of the available simulation time, optimized stochastic gauges, a
general form of the characteristic stochastic variance and adaptations for very
large systems. Testing the performance of particular drift and diffusion gauges
for nonlocal interactions, we find that, for small to medium systems, drift
gauges are beneficial, whereas for sufficiently large systems, it is optimal to
use only a diffusion gauge.
  The methods are illustrated with direct numerical simulations of interaction
quenches in extended Bose-Hubbard lattice systems and the excitation of Rydberg
states in a Bose-Einstein condensate, also without the need for the typical
frozen gas approximation. We demonstrate that gauges can indeed lengthen the
useful simulation time.

the distribution of its stars and gas in a remarkable agreement with
observations so far. In the solar system, MD predicts the existence of some
possibly non-negligible dynamical effects, which can be used to constrain the
freedom in MD theories. Known extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) have
their argument of perihelion, longitude of ascending node, and inclination
distributed in highly non-uniform fashion; ETNOs are bodies with perihelion
distances greater than the orbit of Neptune and with semimajor axes greater
than 150 au and less than $\sim1500$ au. It is as if these bodies have been
systematically perturbed by some external force. We investigated a hypothesis
that the puzzling orbital characteristics of ETNOs are a consequence of MD. We
set up a dynamical model of the solar system incorporating the external field
effect (EFE), which is anticipated to be the dominant effect of MD in the ETNOs
region. We used constraints available on the strength of EFE coming from radio
tracking of the Cassini spacecraft. We performed several numerical experiments,
concentrating on the long-term orbital evolution of primordial (randomised)
ETNOs in MD. The EFE could produce distinct non-uniform distributions of the
orbital elements of ETNOs that are related to the orientation of an orbit in
space. If we demand that EFE is solely responsible for the detachment of Sedna
and 2012 VP$_{113}$, then these distributions are at odds with the currently
observed statistics on ETNOs unless the EFE quadrupole strength parameter
$Q_{2}$ has values that are unlikely (with probability < 1$\%$) in light of the
Cassini data.

standard way to understand the interdependency of activity recorded at
different sites. The new research frontier in this direction includes the
important problem of how to assess dynamic changes of signal activity. We
address this problem in a novel way by defining the graph-variate signal
alongside methods for its analysis. Essentially, graph-variate signal analysis
leverages graphs of reliable connectivity information to filter instantaneous
bivariate functions of the multivariate signal. This opens up a new and robust
approach to analyse joint signal and network dynamics at sample resolution.
Furthermore, our method can be formulated as instantaneous networks on which
standard network analysis can be implemented. When graph connectivity is
estimated from the multivariate signal itself, the appropriate consideration of
instantaneous graph signal functions allows for a novel dynamic connectivity
measure-- graphvariate dynamic (GVD) connectivity-- which is robust to spurious
short-term dependencies. Particularly, we present appropriate functions for
three pertinent connectivity metrics-- correlation, coherence and the phase-lag
index. We show that our approach can determine signals with a single correlated
couple against wholly uncorrelated data of up to 128 nodes in signal size (1
out of 8128 weighted edges). GVD connectivity is also shown to be more robust
than i) other GSP approaches at detecting a randomly traveling spheroid on a 3D
grid and ii) standard dynamic connectivity in determining differences in EEG
restingstate and task-related activity. We also demonstrate its use in
revealing hidden depth correlations from geophysical gamma ray data. We expect
that the methods and framework presented will provide new approaches to data
analysis in a variety of applied settings.

from a campaign of large-scale numerical simulations on lattices of up to

over a wide range of scales, and estimate the asymptotic values of the mean
string separation in horizon length units $\dot{\xi}$ and of the mean square
string velocity $\bar v^2$ in the continuum and large time limits. The scaling
occurs because the strings lose energy into classical radiation of the scalar
and gauge fields of the Abelian Higgs model. We quantify the energy loss with a
dimensionless radiative efficiency parameter, and show that it does not vary
significantly with lattice spacing or string separation. This implies that the
radiative energy loss underlying the scaling behaviour is not a lattice
artefact, and justifies the extrapolation of measured network properties to
large times for computations of cosmological perturbations. We also show that
the core growth method, which increases the defect core width with time to
extend the dynamic range of simulations, does not introduce significant
systematic error. We compare $\dot{\xi}$ and $\bar v^2$ to values measured in
simulations using the Nambu-Goto approximation, finding that the latter
underestimate the mean string separation by about 25%, and overestimate $\bar
v^2$ by about 10%. The scaling of the string separation implies that string
loops decay by the emission of massive radiation within a Hubble time in field
theory simulations, in contrast to the Nambu-Goto scenario which neglects this
energy loss mechanism. String loops surviving for only one Hubble time emit
much less gravitational radiation than in the Nambu-Goto scenario, and are
consequently subject to much weaker gravitational wave constraints on their
tension.

the quantum inverse scattering method cannot be applied because the Poisson
bracket is non ultra-local. Inspired by an approach of Faddeev and Reshetikhin,
we show that in this class of models, there is a way to deform the symplectic

lattice theory takes the form of a generalized spin chain that can be solved by
standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques. We then argue that the IR limit of

formulation: given a set $S$ of random variables, it is required to find the
finest partitioning $\{U_1,\dots,U_k\}$ of $S$ into clusters such that the
clusters $U_1,\dots,U_k$ are mutually independent. Since mutual independence is
the target, pairwise similarity measurements are of no use, and thus
traditional clustering algorithms are inapplicable. The distribution of the
random variables in $S$ is, in general, unknown, but a sample is available.
Thus, the problem is cast in terms of time series. Two forms of sampling are
considered: i.i.d.\ and stationary time series, with the main emphasis being on
the latter, more general, case. A consistent, computationally tractable
algorithm for each of the settings is proposed, and a number of open directions
for further research are outlined.

side-by-side comparison shows that the absolute intensity of the Ga-polar

photoluminescence transients obtained by time-resolved measurements, indicating
the presence of a highly efficient nonradiative decay channel for the quantum
disks. In apparent contradiction to this conjecture, the decay of both samples
is observed to slow down dramatically after the initial rapid decay.
Independent of temperature, the transients approach a power law for longer
decay times, reflecting that recombination occurs between individual electrons
and holes with varying spatial separation. Employing a coupled system of
stochastic integro-differential equations taking into account both radiative
and nonradiative Shockley-Read-Hall recombination of spatially separate

environmental changes, effects of anthropogenic deforestation, and long term
land cover-climate feedbacks. Observation based reconstructions of past land
cover are rare and commonly used model based reconstructions exhibit
considerable differences. Recently \citet[Spatial Statistics,
24:14--31,][]{PirzaLPG2018_24} developed a statistical interpolation method
that produces spatially complete reconstructions of past land cover from pollen
assemblage. These reconstructions incorporate a number of auxiliary datasets
raising questions regarding the method's sensitivity to different auxiliary
datasets.
  Here the sensitivity of the method is examined by performing spatial
reconstructions for northern Europe during three time periods (1900 CE, 1725 CE
and 4000 BCE). The auxiliary datasets considered include the most commonly
utilized sources of past land-cover data --- e.g.\ estimates produced by a
dynamic vegetation (DVM) and anthropogenic land-cover change (ALCC) models.
Five different auxiliary datasets were considered, including different climate
data driving the DVM and different ALCC models. The resulting reconstructions
were also evaluated using cross-validation for all the time periods. For the
recent time period, 1900 CE, the different land-cover reconstructions were
compared against a present day forest map.
  The validation confirms that the statistical model provides a robust spatial
interpolation tool with low sensitivity to differences in auxiliary data and
high capacity to capture information in the pollen based proxy data. Further
auxiliary data with high spatial detail improves model performance for areas
with complex topography or few observations.

electron energy $\varepsilon_e\sim0.3$ GeV, total energy $\sim10^{49}$ erg. The
hot radiating plasma is confined by a cold plasma of mass $M_c<0.03
(R/10^{17.5}{\rm cm})^4 M_\odot$. The source is nearly resolved, and may be
resolved by 10 GHz observations. The fact that $\varepsilon_e\sim m_p c^2$
suggests that the hot plasma was created by the ejection of a mildly
relativistic, $M\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ shell, which propagated into an extended
ambient medium or collided with a pre-ejected shell of mass $M_c$. The inferred
plasma properties are inconsistent with typical ""magnetar wind nebulae"" model
predictions.
  We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of FRBs (independent of
the persistent source model): Ejection from an underlying compact object,
$R_s\sim10^{6}$ cm, of highly relativistic shells, with energy $E_s=10^{41}$
erg and Lorentz factor $\gamma_s$~$10^3$, into a surrounding e-p plasma with
density $n\sim0.1/cm^3$ (consistent with that inferred for the plasma producing
the persistent emission associated with FRB 121102). Such shell ejections with
energy typical for FRB events lead to plasma conditions appropriate for strong
synchrotron maser emission at the GHz range, $\nu_{
coh.}\sim0.5(E/10^{41}erg)^{1/4}$ GHz. In this model, a significant fraction of
the deposited energy is converted to an FRB with duration $R_s/c$, accompanied
by ~10 MeV photons carrying less energy than the FRB.
  The inferred energy and mass associated with the source are low compared to
those of typical supernova ejecta. This may suggest some type of a ""weak
stellar explosion"", where a neutron star is formed with relatively low mass and
energy ejection. However, the current upper limit on R does not allow one to
rule out $M_c\sim1M_\odot$.

extinction. The anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE) proposes that such extinctions
can be caused by prices for wildlife products increasing with species rarity.
This price-rarity relationship creates financial incentives to extract the last
remaining individuals of a population, despite higher search and harvest costs.
The AAE has become a standard approach for conceptualizing the threat of
economic markets on endangered species. Despite its potential importance for
conservation, AAE theory is based on a simple graphical model with limited
analysis of possible population trajectories. By specifying a general class of
functions for price-rarity relationships, we show that the classic theory can
understate the risk of species extinction. AAE theory proposes that only
populations below a critical Allee threshold will go extinct due to increasing
price-rarity relationships. Our analysis shows that this threshold can be much
higher than the original theory suggests, depending on initial harvest effort.
More alarmingly, even species with population sizes above this Allee threshold,
for which AAE predicts persistence, can be destined to extinction. Introducing
even a minimum price for harvested individuals, close to zero, can cause large
populations to cross the classic anthropogenic Allee threshold on a trajectory
towards extinction. These results suggest that traditional AAE theory may give
a false sense of security when managing large harvested populations.

tunnel barrier, i.e. oxidation state of the metals as well as concentration and
distribution of oxygen ions, have a major influence on electronic conduction,
these factors were carefully analysed. A combined approach was chosen in order
to reliably investigate electronic states of Nb and O by electron energy-loss
spectroscopy as well as map elements whose transition edges exhibit a different

MN Draconis.
  Aims: MN Draconis is a poorly known active dwarf nova in the period gap and
is one of the only two known cases of period gap SU UMa objects showing the
negative superhumps. Photometric behaviour of MN Draconis poses a challenge for
existing models of the superhump and superoutburst mechanisms. Therefore,
thorough investigation of peculiar systems, such as MN Draconis, is crucial for
our understanding of evolution of the close binary stars.
  Methods: To measure fundamental parameters of the system, we collected
photometric data in October 2009, June-September 2013 and June-December 2015.
Analysis of the light curves, $O-C$ diagrams and power spectra was carried out.
  Results: During our three observational seasons we detected four
superoutburts and several normal outbursts. Based on the two consecutive
superoutbursts detected in 2015, the supercycle length was derived P_sc = 74
+/- 0.5 days and it has been increasing with a rate of P_dot = 3.3 x 10^(-3)
during last twelve years. Based on the positive and negative superhumps we
calculated the period excess epsilon = 5.6% +/- 0.1%, the period deficit
epsilon_ = 2.5% +/- 0.6%, and in result, the orbital period P_orb = 0.0994(1)
days (143.126 +/- 0.144 min). We updated the basic light curve parameters of MN
Draconis.
  Conclusions: MN Draconis is the first discovered SU UMa system in the period
gap with increasing supercycle length.

Boolean variables, whereas considering more than two levels is sometimes
useful. Multivalued networks can be converted to partial Boolean maps, in a way
that preserves the asynchronous dynamics. We investigate the problem of
extending these maps to non-admissible states, i.e. states that do not have a
multivalued counterpart. We observe that attractors are preserved if a stepwise
version of the original function is considered for conversion. Different
extensions of the Boolean conversion affect the structure of the interaction
graphs in different ways. A particular technique for extending the partial
Boolean conversion is identified, that ensures that feedback cycles are
preserved. This property, combined with the conservation of the asymptotic
behaviour, can prove useful for the application of results and analyses defined
in the Boolean setting to multivalued networks, and vice versa. As a first
application, by considering the conversion of a known example for the discrete
multivalued case, we create a Boolean map showing that the existence of a
cyclic attractor and the absence of fixed points are compatible with the
absence of local negative cycles. We then state a multivalued version of a
result connecting mirror states and local feedback cycles.

$S_4$ flavour symmetry from the requirement of generating non-zero reactor
mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ along with correct dark matter relic abundance. The
leading order $S_4$ model gives rise to tri-bimaximal type leptonic mixing
resulting in $\theta_{13}=0$. Non-zero $\theta_{13}$ is generated at one loop
level by extending the model with additional scalar and fermion fields which
take part in the loop correction. The particles going inside the loop are odd
under an in-built $Z^{\text{Dark}}_2$ symmetry such that the lightest
$Z^{\text{Dark}}_2$ odd particle can be a dark matter candidate. Correct
neutrino and dark matter phenomenology can be achieved for such one loop
corrections either to the light neutrino mass matrix or to the charged lepton
mass matrix although the latter case is found to be more predictive. The
predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay is also discussed and inverted
hierarchy in the charged lepton correction case is found to be disfavoured by
the latest KamLAND-Zen data.

a many-particle bath is inherently challenging, and usually requires
large-scale numerical computations. Here, we present an alternative approach to
the problem - that based on the notion of the angulon quasiparticle. We show
that molecules rotating inside superfluid helium nanodroplets and Bose-Einstein
Condensates form angulons, and therefore can be described by straightforward
solutions of a simple microscopic Hamiltonian. Casting the problem in the
language of angulons allows not only to tremendously simplify it, but also to
gain insights into the origins of the observed phenomena and to make

as an iterative scheme, which is a weakly tamed discretization scheme for a
certain stochastic differential equation (SDE). Assuming a suitable
approximation result, dynamical properties of the SDE can be rigorously pulled
back via the discrete scheme to the original Ensemble Kalman inversion.
  The results of this paper make a step towards closing the gap of the missing
approximation result by proving a strong convergence result in a simplified
model of a scalar stochastic differential equation. We focus here on a toy
model with similar properties than the one arising in the context of Ensemble
Kalman filter. The proposed model can be interpreted as a single particle
filter for a linear map and thus forms the basis for further analysis. The
difficulty in the analysis arises from the formally derived limiting SDE with
non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities both in the drift and in the
diffusion. Here the standard Euler-Maruyama scheme might fail to provide a
strongly convergent numerical scheme and taming is necessary. In contrast to
the strong taming usually used, the method presented here provides a weaker
form of taming.
  We present a strong convergence analysis by first proving convergence on a
domain of high probability by using a cut-off or localisation, which then
leads, combined with bounds on moments for both the SDE and the numerical
scheme, by a bootstrapping argument to strong convergence.

spectroscopic surveys, to the fact that exotic astronomical objects (e.g.
quasars or active galactic nuclei) that send ultra-rapid quasi periodic pulses
of optical light would generate spectroscopic features that look like emission
lines. This gives a simple technique to find quasi periodic pulses separated by
times smaller than a nanosecond. One should look for emission lines that cannot
be identified with known spectral lines in spectra. Such signals, generated by
slower pulses, could also be found in the far infra-red, millimeter and radio
regions, where they could be detected as objects unusually bright in a single
narrow-band filter or channel. The outstanding interest of the technique comes
from its simplicity so that it can be used to find ultra-rapid quasi-periodic
oscillators in large astronomical surveys. A very small fraction of objects
presently identified as Lyman alpha emitters that do not have other spectral
features to confirm the Lyman alpha redshift, may possibly be quasi-periodic
oscillators. However this is only a hypothesis that needs more observations for
confirmation.

structure of finite dimensional quantum theory are, in light of the

self-dual cones of positive semi-definite linear endomorphisms on finite
dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. From the perspective of category theory,
these cones are the sets of morphisms in finite dimensional quantum theory as a
dagger compact closed category. Understanding the intricate geometry of these
cones and charting the wider landscape for their host category is imperative
for foundational physics. In Part I of this thesis, we study the shape of
finite dimensional quantum theory in terms of quantum information. In Part II
of this thesis, we move beyond quantum theory within the vein of Euclidean
Jordan algebras. In posting this thesis on the arXiv, we hope that it might

A2142 (z=0.0909), which we performed to explore its nature and origin. A2142 is
not a major merger and the presence of a giant radio halo is somewhat
surprising. We performed deep radio observations with the GMRT at 608 MHz, 322
MHz, and 234 MHz and with the VLA in the 1-2 GHz band. We obtained high-quality
images at all frequencies in a wide range of resolutions. The radio halo is
well detected at all frequencies and extends out to the most distant cold front
in A2142. We studied the spectral index in two regions: the central part of the
halo and a second region in the direction of the most distant south-eastern
cold front, selected to follow the bright part of the halo and X-ray emission.
We complemented our observations with a preliminary LOFAR image at 118 MHz and
with the re-analysis of archival VLA data at 1.4 GHz. The two components of the
radio halo show different observational properties. The central brightest part
has higher surface brightess and a spectrum whose steepness is similar to those
of the known radio halos, i.e. $\alpha^{\rm 1.78~GHz}_{\rm 118~MHz}=1.33\pm
0.08$. The ridge, which fades into the larger scale emission, is broader in
size and has considerably lower surface brightess and a moderately steeper
spectrum, i.e. $\alpha^{\rm 1.78~GHz}_{\rm 118~MHz}\sim 1.5$. We propose that
the brightest part of the radio halo is powered by the central sloshing in
A2142, similar to what has been suggested for mini-halos, or by secondary
electrons generated by hadronic collisions in the ICM. On the other hand, the
steeper ridge may probe particle re-acceleration by turbulence generated either
by stirring the gas and magnetic fields on a larger scale or by less energetic
mechanisms, such as continuous infall of galaxy groups or an off-axis merger.

weights that capture units' probabilities of inclusion for claims of
representativeness. Yet, much uncertainty remains regarding how these weights
should be employed in the analysis of survey experiments: Should they be used
or ignored? If they are used, which estimators are preferred? We offer
practical advice, rooted in the Neyman-Rubin model, for researchers producing
and working with survey experimental data. We examine simple, efficient
estimators for analyzing these data, and give formulae for their biases and
variances. We provide simulations that examine these estimators as well as real
examples from experiments administered online through YouGov. We find that for
examining the existence of population treatment effects using high-quality,
broadly representative samples recruited by top online survey firms, sample
quantities, which do not rely on weights, are often sufficient. We found that
Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) estimates did not appear to differ
substantially from their weighted counterparts, and they avoided the
substantial loss of statistical power that accompanies weighting. When precise
estimates of Population Average Treatment Effects (PATE) are essential, we
analytically show post-stratifying on survey weights and/or covariates highly
correlated with the outcome to be a conservative choice. While we show these
substantial gains in simulations, we find limited evidence of them in practice.

perpendicular to the 2D-SiC plane, a characteristic peak is found for the
MuL-SiC at about 4.0 eV, except that the allowed {\pi}->{\sigma}* and
{\sigma}->{\pi}* transition peaks are found for both ML-SiC and MuL-SiC in the
high-energy region (> 8 eV). This characteristic peak is attributed to the
interlayer {\pi}->{\pi}* transition which does not exist for the ML-SiC, and at
this peak position, the ML-SiC has a weak dark exciton based on the mBJ
calculation within the Bethe-Salpeter equation framework. For
\{chi}(2)({\omega}), the single-particle transition channels based on the
three-band terms dominate the second harmonic generation process of both ML-SiC
and MuL-SiC and determine the size and sign of \{chi}(2)({\omega}). In the
ultraviolet visible region, the purely interband motion and intraband motion of
electrons competitively determine the size and sign of \{chi}(2)({\omega}). For
the light polarization perpendicular to the 2D-SiC plane, the intraband motion
of electrons modulated more dramatically the interband motion than for that
parallel to the 2D-SiC plane.

studied by high pressure investigations of the magnetic and electrical
transport properties, in order to unravel the complex interplay of
superconductivity and magnetism. The compound reveals an exceedingly broad
re-entrant transition to the superconducting state between $T_{\rm{c,on}} =
19.8$ K and $T_{\rm{c,0}} = 5.2$ K due to a canted A-type antiferromagnetic
ordering of the Eu$^{2+}$ moments at $T_{\rm{N}} = 16.6$ K and a re-entrant
spin glass transition at $T_{\rm{SG}} = 14.1$ K. At ambient pressure evidences
for the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism could be observed,
as well as a magnetic-field-induced enhancement of the zero-resistance
temperature $T_{\rm{c,0}}$ up to $7.2$ K with small magnetic fields applied
parallel to the \textit{ab}-plane of the crystal. We attribute the
field-induced-enhancement of superconductivity to the suppression of the
ferromagnetic component of the Eu$^{2+}$ moments along the \textit{c}-axis,
which leads to a reduction of the orbital pair breaking effect. Application of
hydrostatic pressure suppresses the superconducting state around $14$ kbar
along with a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity, implying that a
non-Fermi liquid region is located at the boundary of the superconducting
phase. At intermediate pressure, an additional feature in the resistivity
curves is identified, which can be suppressed by external magnetic fields and
competes with the superconducting phase. We suggest that the effect of negative
pressure by the chemical Rh substitution in
Eu(Fe$_{0.93}$Rh$_{0.07}$)$_2$As$_2$ is partially reversed, leading to a
re-activation of the spin density wave.

uninhabited, massive mound structures enclosing a network of broad tunnels
which protrude from the ground meters above their subterranean nests. It is
widely accepted that the purpose of these mounds is to give the colony a
controlled micro-climate in which to raise fungus and brood by managing heat,
humidity, and respiratory gas exchange. While different hypotheses such as
steady and fluctuating external wind and internal metabolic heating have been
proposed for ventilating the mound, the absence of direct in-situ measurement
of internal air flows has precluded a definitive mechanism for this critical
physiological function. By measuring diurnal variations in flow through the
surface conduits of the mounds of the species Odontotermes obesus, we show that
a simple combination of geometry, heterogeneous thermal mass and porosity
allows the mounds to use diurnal ambient temperature oscillations for
ventilation. In particular, the thin outer flute-like conduits heat up rapidly
during the day relative to the deeper chimneys, pushing air up the flutes and
down the chimney in a closed convection cell, with the converse situation at
night. These cyclic flows in the mound flush out $\text{CO}_2$ from the nest
and ventilate the colony, in a novel example of deriving useful work from
thermal oscillations.

distribution grids, e.g., micro-phasor measurement units ({\mu}PMU), provides
unprecedented potentials for wide-area monitoring and diagnostic applications,
e.g., situational awareness, health monitoring of distribution assets.
Unexpected disruptive events interrupting the normal operation of assets in
distribution grids can eventually lead to permanent failure with expensive
replacement cost over time. Therefore, disruptive event classification provides
useful information for preventive maintenance of the assets in distribution
networks. Preventive maintenance provides wide range of benefits in terms of
time, avoiding unexpected outages, maintenance crew utilization, and equipment
replacement cost. In this paper, a PMU-data-driven framework is proposed for
classification of disruptive events in distribution networks. The two
disruptive events, i.e., malfunctioned capacitor bank switching and
malfunctioned regulator on-load tap changer (OLTC) switching are considered and
distinguished from the normal abrupt load change in distribution grids. The
performance of the proposed framework is verified using the simulation of the
events in the IEEE 13-bus distribution network. The event classification is
formulated using two different algorithms as; i) principle component analysis
(PCA) together with multi-class support vector machine (SVM), and ii)
autoencoder along with softmax classifier. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and satisfactory classification
accuracies.
