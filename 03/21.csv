(EOB) waveform model of Nagar et al. [Phys. Rev. D93, 044046 (2016)], informed
using 40 numerical-relativity (NR) datasets, against a set of 149, $\ell=m=2$,
NR waveforms freely available through the Simulation Extreme Spacetime (SXS)
catalog. We find that, without further calibration, these EOBNR waveforms have
unfaithfulness (at design Advanced-LIGO sensitivity and evaluated with total
mass $M$ varying as $10M_\odot\leq M \leq 200M_\odot$) always below $1\%$
against all NR waveforms except for three outliers, that still never exceed the
$3\%$ level; with a minimal retuning of the (effective)
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order spin-orbit coupling parameter for the
non-equal-mass and non-equal-spin sector, that only needs three more NR
waveforms, one is left with another two (though different) outliers, with
maximal unfaithfulness of up to only $2\%$ for a total mass of $200M_\odot$. We
show this is the effect of slight inaccuracies in the phenomenological
description of the postmerger waveform of Del Pozzo and Nagar
[arXiv:1606.03952] that was constructed by interpolating over only 40NR
simulations. We argue that this is easily fixed by using either an alternative
ringdown description (e.g., the superposition of quasi-normal-modes) or an
improved version of the phenomenological representation. By analyzing a NR
waveform with mass ratio $8$ and dimensionless spins $+0.85$ obtained with the
BAM code, we conclude that the model would benefit from NR simulations
specifically targeted at improving the postmerger-ringdown phenomenological
fits for mass ratios $\gtrsim 8$ and spins $\gtrsim 0.8$.

computer vision tasks, such as image classification. By performing linear
combinations and element-wise nonlinear operations, these networks can be
thought of as extracting solely first-order information from an input image. In
the past, however, second-order statistics computed from handcrafted features,
e.g., covariances, have proven highly effective in diverse recognition tasks.
In this paper, we introduce a novel class of CNNs that exploit second-order

covariance matrix from convolutional activations, (ii) compute a parametric,
second-order transformation of a matrix, and (iii) perform a parametric
vectorization of a matrix. These operations can be assembled to form a
Covariance Descriptor Unit (CDU), which replaces the fully-connected layers of
standard CNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our new

fewer parameters.

coupling of pressure and deformation, which can be utilized as an actuation
mechanism for surface deformations in a wide range of applications, including
microfluidics, optics, and soft robotics. Implementation of such configurations
inherently takes place over finite domains and often requires some
pre-stretching of the sheet. Under the assumptions of strong pre-stretching and
small deformations of the lubricated elastic sheet, we use the linearized
Reynolds and Foppl-von Karman equations to derive closed-form analytical
solutions describing the deformation in a finite domain due to external forces,
accounting for both bending and tension effects. We provide a closed-form
solution for the case of a square-shaped actuation region and present the
effect of pre-stretching on the dynamics of the deformation. We further present
the dependence of the deformation magnitude and timescale on the spatial
wavenumber, as well as the transition between stretching- and bending-dominant
regimes. We also demonstrate the effect of spatial discretization of the
forcing (representing practical actuation elements) on the achievable
resolution of the deformation. Extending the problem to an axisymmetric domain,
we investigate the effects arising from nonlinearity of the Reynolds and
Foppl-von Karman equations and present the deformation behavior as it becomes
comparable to the initial film thickness and dependent on the induced tension.

components may vary over time. With the emergence of mobile computing such
architectures became increasingly important and several techniques emerged to
support in their specification. These techniques usually allow for the
specification of concrete architecture instances. Sometimes, however, it is
desired to focus on the specification of constraints, rather than concrete
architectures. Especially specifications of architecture patterns usually focus
on a few, important constraints, leaving out the details of the concrete
architecture implementing the pattern. With this article we introduce an
approach to specify such constraints for dynamic architectures. To this end, we
introduce the notion of configuration traces as an abstract model for dynamic
architectures. Then, we introduce the notion of configuration trace assertions
as a formal language based on linear temporal logic to specify constraints for
such architectures. In addition, we also introduce the notion of configuration
diagrams to specify interfaces and certain common activation and connection
constraints in one single, graphical notation. The approach is well-suited to
specify patterns for dynamic architectures and verify them by means of formal
analyses. This is demonstrated by applying the approach to specify and verify
the Blackboard pattern for dynamic architectures.

electroweak production of these scalars is modest, the greatest opportunity for
their detection might come from rare top decays. For mass hierarchies of the
type $m_t>m_{H^\pm}>m_{A^0,\,H^0}$, the natural signal can arise from top quark
pair production, followed by the decay chain $t \rightarrow b\,H^+$, $H^+

  Values in Critical Besov Spaces","Some minor typos have now been corrected",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2016, Seregin and \u{S}ver\'ak, conceived a notion of global in time
solution (as well as proving existence of them) to the three dimensional
Navier-Stokes equation with $L_3$ solenoidal initial data called 'global $L_3$
solutions'. A key feature of global $L_3$ solutions is continuity with respect
to weak convergence of a sequence of solenoidal $L_3$ initial data. The first
aim of this paper is to show that a similar notion of ' global
$\dot{B}^{-\frac{1}{4}}_{4,\infty}$ solutions' exists for solenoidal initial
data in the wider critical space $\dot{B}^{-\frac{1}{4}}_{4,\infty}$ and
satisfies certain continuity properties with respect to weak* convergence of a
sequence of solenoidal $\dot{B}^{-\frac{1}{4}}_{4,\infty}$ initial data. This
is the widest such critical space if one requires the solution to the
Navier-Stokes equations minus the caloric extension of the initial data to be
in the global energy class.
  For the case of initial values in the wider class of
$\dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}$ initial data ($p>4)$, we prove that for
any $0<T<\infty$ there exists a solution to the Navier-Stokes system on
$\mathbb{R}^3 \times ]0,T[$ with this initial data. We discuss how properties
of these solutions imply a new regularity criteria for 3D weak Leray-Hopf
solutions in terms of the norm
$\|v(\cdot,t)\|_{\dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}}$ (as well as certain
additional assumptions).
  The main new observation of this paper, that enables these results, regards
the decomposition of homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{-1+\frac 3
p}_{p,\infty}$. This does not appear to obviously follow from the known real
interpolation theory.

criterion while the enthalpy flux is outward directed. This occurs when the
heat conduction profile at the bottom of the CZ is smoothly varying, based
either on a Kramers-like opacity prescription as a function of temperature and
density or a static profile of a similar shape. We show that the subadiabatic
layer arises due to nonlocal energy transport by buoyantly driven downflows in
the upper parts of the CZ. Analysis of the force balance of the upflows and
downflows confirms that convection is driven by cooling at the surface. We find
that the commonly used prescription for the convective enthalpy flux being
proportional to the negative entropy gradient does not hold in the stably
stratified layers where the flux is positive. We demonstrate the existence of a
non-gradient contribution to the enthalpy flux, which is estimated to be
important throughout the convective layer. A quantitative analysis of downflows
indicates a transition from a tree-like structure where smaller downdrafts
merge into larger ones in the upper parts to a structure in the deeper parts

represent rich classes of functions. The primary notion for formally reasoning
about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation
where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to realize (or
approximate) functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses
focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are
representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the
expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the
observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways.
We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering
state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and
analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that
interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive
efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between
intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in
large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is
practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the
expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates
into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may
serve a key role in the development of new tools for deep network design.

excitation of plasma waves important for particle scattering, but also by
inducing the motion of the interstellar medium in the direction opposite to the
gravitational pull exerted by matter in the Galaxy, thereby resulting in the
launching of a wind. The recent discovery of several unexpected features in

be both positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) have attracted
substantial attention of the research community. Examples of such networks are
models of opinion dynamics over signed graphs, recently introduced by Altafini
(2012,2013) and extended to discrete-time case by Meng et al. (2014). It has
been shown that under mild connectivity assumptions these protocols provide the
convergence of opinions in absolute value, whereas their signs may differ. This
""modulus consensus"" may correspond to the polarization of the opinions (or
bipartite consensus, including the usual consensus as a special case), or their
convergence to zero. In this paper, we demonstrate that the phenomenon of
modulus consensus in the discrete-time Altafini model is a manifestation of a
more general and profound fact, regarding the solutions of a special recurrent
inequality. Although such a recurrent inequality does not provide the
uniqueness of a solution, it can be shown that, under some natural assumptions,
each of its bounded solutions has a limit and, moreover, converges to
consensus. A similar property has previously been established for special
continuous-time differential inequalities (Proskurnikov, Cao, 2016). Besides
analysis of signed networks, we link the consensus properties of recurrent
inequalities to the convergence analysis of distributed optimization algorithms
and the problems of Schur stability of substochastic matrices.

to Alfv\'en waves propagating along current sheets. If these sheets are closely
aligned to our line-of-sight to the pulsar, high bending angles arise at the
wave crests and a selection effect causes alignment of images produced at
different crests, similar to grazing reflection off of a lake. Using geometric
optics, we develop a simple parameterized model of these corrugated sheets that
can be constrained with a single observation and that makes observable
predictions for variations in the scintillation of the pulsar over time and
frequency. This model reveals qualitative differences between lensing from
overdense and underdense corrugated sheets: Only if the sheet is overdense
compared to the surrounding interstellar medium can the lensed images be
brighter than the line-of-sight image to the pulsar, and the faint lensed

paths taken by other particles. In a random walk with memory, a particle is
more likely to continue along its line of motion than change its direction.
Both memory and reinforcement have been studied independently in random walks

XMM-Newton observation in 2014. The new data provide better sampling in the
time domain and improved sensitivity at low energies below 1 keV. Spectral fits
with thermal emission models require at least two temperature components at
kT_cool ~ 0.4 keV and kT_hot ~ 2.2 keV. The value of kT_hot is about a factor
of two less than inferred from Chandra, suggesting that the hot-component
temperature is variable. The best-fit absorption column density is in good
agreement with that expected from optical extinction estimates A_v = 1.3 - 1.7
mag. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity is L_x(0.2 - 10 keV) = 3e30 ergs/s.
Estimates of the X-ray heating rate of the inner disk and protoplanets are
sensitive to the assumed disk gas surface density for which recent ALMA
observations give estimates Sigma_0(gas) ~ 100 g/cm^2 at 1 AU from the star. At
such densities, X-ray heating is confined mainly to the upper disk layers and
X-ray penetration through the disk midplane to the protoplanets at r ~ 15 - 20
AU is negligible.

a $\Gamma$-limit of a particular mean-field free energy as the sample size

Our analysis takes place in a broader framework however, also providing results
for more general systems such as biaxial or polar molecules. We start from a
mesoscopic model describing a competition between entropy and a non-local
pairwise interactions between molecules. We assume the interaction potential is
separable so that the energy can be reduced to a model involving a macroscopic
order parameter. We assume only integrability and decay properties of the
macroscopic interaction, but no regularity assumptions are required. In
particular, singular interactions are permitted. The analysis becomes
significantly simpler on a translationally invariant domain, so we first
consider periodic domains with increasing domain of periodicity. Then we tackle
the problem on a Lipschitz domain with non-local boundary conditions by
considering an asymptotically equivalent problem on periodic domains. We
conclude by applying the results to a case which reduces to the Oseen-Frank
model of elasticity, and give expressions for the Frank constants in terms of
integrals of the interaction kernel.

that for stellar mass BHs forming hierarchically the distribution of spin

allow for mergers of arbitrary mass ratios and show that this scenario predicts
a unique spin distribution that is similar to the universal distribution
derived for major majors. We explore the ability of spin measurements from
ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors to constrain hierarchical merger
scenarios. We apply a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to mock GW data and
argue that the fraction of BHs that formed through hierarchical mergers will be
constrained with $\mathcal{O}(100)$ LIGO binary black hole detections, while
with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ detections we could falsify a model in which all

thermal-origin Dark Matter (DM), which couples inelastically to the Standard
Model. Since the DM only interacts by transitioning to a heavier state,
freeze-out proceeds via coannihilation and the unstable heavier state is
depleted at later times. For sufficiently large mass splittings, direct
detection is kinematically forbidden and indirect detection is impossible, so
this scenario can only be tested with accelerators. Here we propose new
searches at proton and electron beam fixed-target experiments to probe sub-GeV
coannihilation, exploiting the distinctive signals of up- and down-scattering
as well as decay of the excited state inside the detector volume. We focus on a
representative model in which DM is a pseudo-Dirac fermion coupled to a hidden
gauge field (dark photon), which kinetically mixes with the visible photon. We
define theoretical targets in this framework and determine the existing bounds
by reanalyzing results from previous experiments. We find that LSND, E137, and
BaBar data already place strong constraints on the parameter space consistent
with a thermal freeze-out origin, and that future searches at Belle II and
MiniBooNE, as well as recently-proposed fixed-target experiments such as LDMX

be naturally accessed in a warped UV completion, where the neutrino sector can
also generate the Z2-breaking Higgs mass term needed to produce the hierarchy

previously known to host a transiting planet with a period of 9.29 days, a
radius of 2.2 R$_\oplus$ and an upper limit on the mass of 20 M$_\oplus$. The
presence of a second, non-transiting planet was inferred from the transit time
variations (TTVs) of Kepler-19b, over 8 quarters of Kepler photometry, although
neither mass nor period could be determined. By combining new TTVs measurements
from all the Kepler quarters and 91 high-precision radial velocities obtained
with the HARPS-N spectrograph, we measured through dynamical simulations a mass
of $8.4 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$ for Kepler-19b. From the same data, assuming system
coplanarity, we determined an orbital period of 28.7 days and a mass of $13.1
\pm 2.7$ M$_\oplus$ for Kepler-19c and discovered a Neptune-like planet with a
mass of $20.3 \pm 3.4$ M$_\oplus$ on a 63 days orbit. By comparing dynamical
simulations with non-interacting Keplerian orbits, we concluded that neglecting
interactions between planets may lead to systematic errors that could hamper
the precision in the orbital parameters when the dataset spans several years.
With a density of $4.32 \pm 0.87$ g cm$^{-3}$ ($0.78 \pm 0.16$ $\rho_\oplus$)
Kepler-19b belongs to the group of planets with a rocky core and a significant
fraction of volatiles, in opposition to low-density planets characterized by
transit-time variations only and the increasing number of rocky planets with
Earth-like density. Kepler-19 joins the small number of systems that reconcile
transit timing variation and radial velocity measurements.

still be obtained by optimizing a suitable invariant mass function. We review
and contrast several proposals in the literature for such ansatze: four
versions of the M_T2-assisted on-shell reconstruction (MAOS), as well as
several variants of the on-shell constrained M_2 variables. We compare the
performance of these methods with regards to the mass determination of a new
particle resonance along the decay chain from the peak of the reconstructed
invariant mass distribution. For concreteness, we consider the event topology
of dilepton ttbar events and study each of the three possible subsystems, in
both a ttbar and a SUSY example. We find that the M_2 variables generally
provide sharper peaks and therefore better ansatze for the invisible momenta.
We show that the performance can be further improved by preselecting events

stars and binaries in the Galaxy. But do we understand their multiplicity from
a theoretical point of view? This can be tested by a comparison with the sample
of WDs within 20 pc, which is minimally affected by selection biases. From the
literature, we compile the available information of the local WD sample with a
particular emphasis on their multiplicity, and compare this to synthetic models
of WD formation in single stars and binaries. As part of our population
synthesis approach, we also study the effect of different assumptions
concerning the star formation history, binary evolution, and the initial
distributions of binary parameters. We find that the observed space densities
of single and binary WDs are well reproduced by the models. The space densities
of the most common WD systems (single WDs and unresolved WD-MS binaries) are
consistent within a factor two with the observed value. We find a discrepancy
only for the space density of resolved double WDs. We exclude that
observational selection effects, fast stellar winds, or dynamical interactions
with other objects in the Milky Way explain this discrepancy. We find that
either the initial mass ratio distribution in the Solar neighbourhood is biased
towards low mass-ratios, or more than ten resolved DWDs have been missed
observationally in the 20 pc sample. Furthermore, we show that the low binary
fraction of WD systems (~25%) compared to Solartype MS-MS binaries (~50%) is
consistent with theory, and is mainly caused by mergers in binary systems, and
to a lesser degree by WDs hiding in the glare of their companion stars. Lastly,
Gaia will dramatically increase the size of the volume-limited WD sample,
detecting the coolest and oldest WDs out to 50 pc. We provide a detailed

symmetry in the quantum theory, their anomalous contributions to observables
remain distinct and well-defined even when the symmetry is broken from the
outset. This paper explores such anomalous contributions to the current,
originating from the axial anomaly in a Weyl semimetal, and in the presence of
a generic Weyl node-mixing term. We find that apart from the familiar anomalous
divergence of the axial current proportional to a product of electric and
magnetic fields, there is another anomalous term proportional to a product of
the electric field and the orientation of a spin-dependent node-mixing vector.
We obtain this result both by a quantum field-theoretic analysis of an
effective Weyl action and solving an explicit lattice model. The extended
spin-mixing mass terms, and the enriched axial anomaly they entail, could arise
as mean-field or proximity-induced order parameters in spin-density-wave phases
in Weyl semimetals or be generated dynamically within a Floquet theory.

configurations of the field lines: the straight line; the Archimede's spiral

sliding along the field lines in the equatorial plane we have found several
interesting features of motion. In particular, it has been shown that for
rectilinear field lines the particles reach the light cylinder (area where the
linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light) zone relatively
slowly for bigger drag forces. Considering the Archimede's spiral, we have
found that in cases when the field lines lag behind the rotation, the particles
achieve the force-free regime of dynamics regardless of the drag force. Unlike
this scenario, when the spiral is screwed up in an opposite direction there the
particles do not reach the force free regime, but tend to stable equilibrium
locations. Such a behaviour has been found for straight field lines as well.

prescription, as the source term in the Friedmann equations we use expectation
values where the unobservable information hidden by the cosmological event
horizon has been neglected i.e. coarse grained over. It is shown that in this
approach the energy-momentum is precisely thermal with constant temperature
despite the dilution from the expansion of space due to a flux of energy
radiated from the horizon. This leads to a self-consistent solution for the
Hubble rate, which is gradually evolving and at late times deviates
significantly from de Sitter. Our results hence imply de Sitter space to be
unstable in this prescription. The solution also suggests dynamical vacuum
energy: the continuous flux of energy is balanced by the generation of negative
vacuum energy, which accumulatively decreases the overall contribution.
Finally, we show that our results admit a thermodynamic interpretation which
provides a simple alternate derivation of the mechanism. For very long times
the solutions coincide with flat space.

distance set problem for Assouad dimension in the plane: if a planar set has
Assouad dimension strictly greater than 1, then its distance set has Assouad
dimension 1. We also obtain partial results in higher dimensions. Second, we
consider how Assouad dimension behaves under orthogonal projection. We extend
the planar projection theorem of Fraser and Orponen to higher dimensions,
provide estimates on the (Hausdorff) dimension of the exceptional set of
projections, and provide a recipe for obtaining results about restricted
families of projections. We provide several illustrative examples throughout.

(0.3-50 keV) and six in the ultraviolet (UV)/optical (1900-5500 A). The three
hardest X-ray bands (>2.5 keV) are all strongly correlated with no measurable
interband lag while the two softer bands show lower variability and weaker
correlations. The UV/optical bands are significantly correlated with the
X-rays, lagging ~3-4 days behind the hard X-rays. The variability within the
UV/optical bands is also strongly correlated, with the UV appearing to lead the
optical by ~0.5-1 day. This combination of >~3 day lags between the X-rays and
UV and <~1 day lags within the UV/optical appears to rule out the ""lamp-post""
reprocessing model in which a hot, X-ray emitting corona directly illuminates
the accretion disk, which then reprocesses the energy in the UV/optical.
Instead, these results appear consistent with the Gardner & Done picture in
which two separate reprocessings occur: first, emission from the corona
illuminates an extreme-UV-emitting toroidal component that shields the disk
from the corona; this then heats the extreme-UV component which illuminates the
disk and drives its variability.

2016 challenge task and data, classifying sounds into one of fifteen common
indoor and outdoor acoustic scenes, such as bus, cafe, car, city center, forest
path, library, train, etc. In total, 13 hours of stereo audio recordings are
available, making this one of the largest datasets available. We perform
experiments on six sets of features, including standard Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCC), Binaural MFCC, log Mel-spectrum and two different large-
scale temporal pooling features extracted using OpenSMILE. On these features,
we apply five models: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Deep Neural Network (DNN),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Deep Neural Net- work (CNN) and
i-vector. Using the late-fusion approach, we improve the performance of the
baseline 72.5% by 15.6% in 4-fold Cross Validation (CV) avg. accuracy and 11%
in test accuracy, which matches the best result of the DCASE 2016 challenge.
With large feature sets, deep neural network models out- perform traditional
methods and achieve the best performance among all the studied methods.
Consistent with other work, the best performing single model is the
non-temporal DNN model, which we take as evidence that sounds in the DCASE

location, and the conflicts that arise between this set of desired positions is
resolved by solving an inverse kinematic problem with constraints.
Reinforcement learning is used to train the controller for a single

when large forces are detected due to contact between the sphere and a
simplified model of the cloth. In simulation, we demonstrate successful
navigation of a robotic arm through a variety of garments, including an

region and its environment, we present a simple way of embedding the QM region
into an effective electrostatic potential representing the environment. This
potential is generated by partitioning the environment into well defined
fragments, and assigning each one a set of electrostatic multipoles, which can
then be used to build up the electrostatic potential. We show that, providing
the fragments and the projection scheme for the multipoles are chosen properly,
this leads to an effective electrostatic embedding of the active QM region
which is of equal quality as a full QM calculation. We coupled our formalism to
the DFT code BigDFT, which uses a minimal set of localized in-situ optimized
basis functions; this property eases the fragment definition while still
describing the electronic structure with great precision. Thanks to the linear
scaling capabilities of BigDFT, we can compare the modeling of the
electrostatic embedding with results coming from unbiased full QM calculations
of the entire system. This enables a reliable and controllable setup of an
effective coarse-graining approach, coupling together different levels of
description, which yields a considerable reduction in the degrees of freedom
and thus paves the way towards efficient QM/QM and QM/MM methods for the
treatment of very large systems.

analysis of the contributing terms allows for an intuitive understanding of the
Raman peak positions and intensities. The Raman spectrum of pure graphene only

foreground contamination due to its location toward the bulge, few details are
known for this cluster: there is no consensus of its age, metallicity, or its
association with the disk or bulge. We identify 5 members based on radial
velocity, metallicity, and position within the GC. Using spectral synthesis,
accurate abundances of Fe and several $\alpha$-, Fe-peak, neutron-capture
elements (Si,Ca,Ti,Cr,Co,Ni,Sr,Eu) were measured. Two of the 5 cluster
candidates are likely non-members, as they have deviant Fe abundances and
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. The mean radial velocity is 19$\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$ with a
low dispersion of 2.8$\pm$3.4 km s$^{-1}$, in line with its low mass. The mean
Fe-abundance from spectral fitting is $-0.88\pm0.03$, with a spread driven by
observational errors. The $\alpha$-elements of the GC candidates are marginally
lower than expected for the bulge at similar metallicities. As spectra of
hundreds of stars were collected in a 2 degree field around ESO452-SC11,

with measured Fe-peak abundances show a large scatter around Solar values,
though with large uncertainties. Our study provides the first systematic
measurement of Sr in a Galactic bulge GC. The Eu and Sr abundances of the GC
candidates are consistent with a disk or bulge association. Our calculations

planetary system of at least seven Earth-mass planets, all within 0.1 au. The
configuration confounds theorists as the planets are not easily explained by
either in situ or migration models. In this Paper we present a scenario for the
formation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model,
planet formation starts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-size particles --
whose origin is the outer disk -- concentrate to trigger streaming
instabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by
pebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's
gravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are
transported by Type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the
magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk
dispersal, the cavity radius expands and the inner-most planets escape
resonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also be applied to other
compact systems and that the many close-in super-Earth systems are a scaled-up
version of TRAPPIST-1. We also hypothesize that few close-in compact systems
harbor giant planets at large distances, since they would have stopped the
pebble flux from the outer disk.

linear-$T$ dependence, which we take as the definition of the pseudogap
temperature $T^\star$- in agreement with gap opening detected in ARPES data. We
track $T^\star$ as a function of doping and find that it decreases linearly vs
$p$ in all four materials, having the same value in the three LSCO-based
cuprates, irrespective of their different crystal structures. At low $p$,
$T^\star$ is higher than the onset temperature of the various orders observed
in underdoped cuprates, suggesting that these orders are secondary
instabilities of the pseudogap phase. A linear extrapolation of $T^\star(p)$ to
$p=0$ yields $T^\star(p\to 0)\simeq T_N(0)$, the N\'eel temperature for the
onset of antiferromagnetic order at $p=0$, suggesting that there is a link
between pseudogap and antiferromagnetism. With increasing $p$, $T^\star(p)$
extrapolates linearly to zero at $p\simeq p_{\rm c2}$, the critical doping
below which superconductivity emerges at high doping, suggesting that the
conditions which favour pseudogap formation also favour pairing. We also use
the Nernst effect to investigate how far superconducting fluctuations extend
above $T_{\rm c}$, as a function of doping, and find that a narrow fluctuation
regime tracks $T_{\rm c}$, and not $T^\star$. This confirms that the pseudogap

constraint over the learned correspondence structure to exclude cross-view

reliable matching score between images. Finally, we also extend our approach by
introducing a multi-structure scheme, which learns a set of local

Similar studies are carried out for the two subclasses of equations with

Applying an original technique, we classify Lie reductions of equations from

expect giant exoplanets to have similar satellite systems. If a Jupiter-like
planet were to migrate toward its parent star the icy moons orbiting it would
evaporate, creating atmospheres and possible habitable surface oceans. Here, we
examine how long the surface ice and possible oceans would last before being
hydrodynamically lost to space. The hydrodynamic loss rate from the moons is
determined, in large part, by the stellar flux available for absorption, which
increases as the giant planet and icy moons migrate closer to the star. At some
planet-star distance the stellar flux incident on the icy moons becomes so
great that they enter a runaway greenhouse state. This runaway greenhouse state
rapidly transfers all available surface water to the atmosphere as vapor, where
it is easily lost from the small moons. However, for icy moons of Ganymede's
size around a Sun-like star we found that surface water (either ice or liquid)
can persist indefinitely outside the runaway greenhouse orbital distance. In
contrast, the surface water on smaller moons of Europa's size will only persist
on timescales greater than 1 Gyr at distances ranging 1.49 to 0.74 AU around a
Sun-like star for Bond albedos of 0.2 and 0.8, where the lower albedo becomes
relevant if ice melts. Consequently, small moons can lose their icy shells,
which would create a torus of H atoms around their host planet that might be
detectable in future observations.

these two anomalies may be owing to the same origin --- the dark matter (DM)
annihilation into $b \bar b$, while these results seem in tension with the
dwarf spheroidal galaxy observations. To give a compatible explanation about
it, we consider the pseudoscalar DM particles $S_d^+ S_d^-$ annihilating via
$S_d^+ S_d^- \rightarrow S_d^0 S_d^0$, with the process mediated by a new
scalar $\phi$ and $S_d^0$ quickly decaying into $b \bar{b}$. For the particles
$S_d^+$, $S_d^-$ and $S_d^0$ in a triplet with degenerate masses, the
annihilation cross section of DM today is linearly dependent on the relative
velocity $v_r$, and thus constraints from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are
relaxed. The parameter spaces are derived with corresponding constraints.
Though traces from the new sector seem challenging to be disclosed at collider
and in DM direct detections, the indirect search of the gamma-ray line from the
$S_d^0$'s decay has the potential to shed light on DM annihilations, with the

approaches have been proposed to quantify and preserve privacy in such

by assuming that computation is performed among utilitarian agents. We
introduce a utilitarian approach where the utility of each state is estimated
as the difference between the reward for reaching an agreement on assignments

solvers where agents integrate the utility function to guide their search and
decide which action to perform, defining thereby their policy. We show that

alternative to the classical Shannon's ergodic capacity since it accounts for
the delay constraints imposed by future wireless applications and their impact
on the overall system performance. This paper presents a novel moment
generating function (MGF)-based framework for the unified EC performance
analysis of a generic Lp-norm diversity combining scheme operating over
arbitrary and correlated generalized fading channels and a maximum delay
constraint. The Lp-norm diversity is a generic diversity structure which
includes as special cases various well-known diversity schemes such as equal
gain combining (EGC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC). For MRC, the proposed
methodology reduces to a previously published MGF-based approach for the
evaluation of the EC, whereas, for EGC, analytical approach presented is novel
and the associated performance evaluation results have not been published
previously in the open technical literature. Based on this methodology, novel
analytical closed-form expressions for the EC performance of dual branch
Lp-norm diversity receivers operating over Gamma shadowed generalized
Nakagami-m fading channels are deduced. For diversity order greater than two, a
novel analytical approach for the asymptotic EC performance analysis is also
developed and evaluated, revealing how basic system parameters affect the
overall system performance. The overall mathematical formalism is validated
with selected numerical and equivalent simulation performance evaluation
results thus confirming the correctness of the proposed unified analytical
methodology.

$\mu_{\rm rel}$, predicted by the microlens models. This excess flux is most
likely to be due to an unrelated star that happens to be located in close
proximity to the source star. Two epochs of HST observations indicate proper
motion for this blend star that is typical of a random bulge star, but is not
consistent with a companion to the source or lens stars if the flux is
dominated by only one star, aside from the lens. We consider models in which
the excess flux is due to a combination of an unrelated star and the lens star,
and this yields 95\% confidence level upper limit on the lens star brightness
of $I_L > 22.44$ and $V_L >23.62$. A Bayesian analysis using a standard
Galactic model and these magnitude limits yields a host star mass $M_h = 0.21

cool-core galaxy clusters, and in particular, how it reduces cloud velocity and
sometimes causes an offset between the cold gas and young stars. The velocities
of the molecular gas in both observations and our simulations fall in the range
of $100-400$ km/s, much lower than expected if they fall from a few tens of kpc
ballistically. If the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is at rest, the ram pressure
of the ICM only slightly reduces the velocity of the clouds. When we assume
that the clouds are actually ""fluffier"" because they are co-moving with a
warm-hot layer, the velocity becomes smaller. If we also consider the AGN wind
in the cluster center by adding a wind profile measured from the simulation,
the clouds are further slowed down at small radii, and the resulting velocities
are in general agreement with the observations and simulations. Because ram
pressure only affects gas but not stars, it can cause a separation between a
filament and young stars that formed in the filament as they move through the
ICM together. This separation has been observed in Perseus and also exists in
our simulations. We show that the star-filament offset combined with
line-of-sight velocity measurements can help determine the true motion of the
cold gas, and thus distinguish between inflows and outflows.

trials with continuous endpoints in which the outcome variance is the nuisance
parameter. For planning and analyzing the trial frequentist methods are
considered. Moreover, the external information on the variance is summarized by
the Bayesian meta-analytic-predictive (MAP) approach. To incorporate external
information into the sample size re-estimation, we propose to update the MAP
prior based on the results of the internal pilot study and to re-estimate the
sample size using an estimator from the posterior. By means of a simulation
study, we compare the operating characteristics such as power and sample size
distribution of the proposed procedure with the traditional sample size
re-estimation approach which uses the pooled variance estimator. The simulation
study shows that, if no prior-data conflict is present, incorporating external
information into the sample size re-estimation improves the operating
characteristics compared to the traditional approach. In the case of a
prior-data conflict, that is when the variance of the ongoing clinical trial is
unequal to the prior location, the performance of the traditional sample size
re-estimation procedure is in general superior, even when the prior information
is robustified. When considering to include prior information in sample size
re-estimation, the potential gains should be balanced against the risks.

outcomes of public events such as elections. Because such high stakes are at
play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging
problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three
generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the
user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has
largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which
has limited their success and generality. In this work, we propose a model that
combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated
prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users
and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news.
Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is
composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is
based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture
the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module
learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two
are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not.
Experimental analysis on real-world data demonstrates that CSI achieves higher
accuracy than existing models, and extracts meaningful latent representations
of both users and articles.

particular, it induces emergent birefringence, rendering the speed of the
emergent light anisotropic and polarization-dependent. A sufficiently strong
electric field triggers a quantum phase transition into new $U(1)$ quantum spin
liquid phases which trap emergent electric $\pi$-fluxes. The flux patterns of

some of the canonical pinch points in the spin structure factor, characteristic

undisturbed fluid velocity, defined as the fluid velocity a particle sees
before the disturbance develops in the fluid. In two-way coupled point-particle
simulations the information from the undisturbed state is not available and
must be approximated using the disturbed velocity field. Horwitz and Mani
(2016) recently developed a procedure to estimate the undisturbed velocity for
particles moving at low Reynolds number and obeying the Stokes drag law. Using
our correction, we demonstrated convergence of numerical simulations to
expected physical behavior for a range of canonical settings. In this paper we
further extend and examine that correction scheme for particles moving at
finite Reynolds number, by considering the Schiller-Nauman drag law. Tests of
particle settling in an otherwise quiescent fluid show reasonable predictions
of settling velocity history for particle Reynolds numbers up to ten. The
correction scheme is shown to lead to $\geq 70\%$ reduction in particle
velocity errors, compared to standard trilinear interpolation of disturbed
velocities. We also discuss the modelling of unsteady effects and their
relation to Stokes number and density ratio. Finally, we propose a regime
diagram to guide scheme selection for point-particle modelling.

$\sim0.5$ to $\sim100$ TeV with the first 17 months of data from the High

steradians and duty cycle of $>95$% are unique features compared to other TeV
observatories that allow us to observe every source that transits over HAWC for
up to $\sim6$ hours each sidereal day. This regular sampling yields
unprecedented light curves from unbiased measurements that are independent of
seasons or weather conditions. For the Crab Nebula as a reference source we
find no variability in the TeV band. Our main focus is the study of the TeV
blazars Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501. A spectral fit for Mrk 421 yields a
power law index $\Gamma=2.21 \pm0.14_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm0.20_{\mathrm{sys}}$ and
an exponential cut-off $E_0=5.4 \pm 1.1_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 1.0_{\mathrm{sys}}$

variability and a Bayesian analysis is applied to identify changes between flux
states. The highest per-transit fluxes observed from Mrk 421 exceed the Crab
Nebula flux by a factor of approximately five. For Mrk 501, several transits
show fluxes in excess of three times the Crab Nebula flux. In a comparison to
lower energy gamma-ray and X-ray monitoring data with comparable sampling we
cannot identify clear counterparts for the most significant flaring features
observed by HAWC.

statistically steady vorticity field is dominated by almost axisymmetric
vortices, and the probability density function of vorticity is non-Gaussian.
However, in the case of linear and quadratic drag, we find that the velocity
statistics is close to Gaussian, with non-negligible contribution coming from
the background turbulent flow. On the other hand, with hypo-drag, the
probability density function of velocity is non-Gaussian and is predominantly
determined by the properties of the vortices. With hypo-drag, the relative

temperature superconductors, supported by the common appearance of a distinct
resonance in the spin susceptibility across the cuprates, iron-based
superconductors and many heavy fermion materials. The information we have about
the spin resonance comes almost exclusively from neutron scattering. Here we
demonstrate that by using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and
spectroscopy we can characterize the spin resonance in real space. We show that
inelastic tunnelling leads to the characteristic dip-hump feature seen in
tunnelling spectra in high temperature superconductors and that this feature
arises from excitations of the spin fluctuations. Spatial mapping of this
feature near defects allows us to probe non-local properties of the spin
susceptibility and to image its real space structure.

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1372",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of ultraluminous X-ray sources are thought to be objects accreting above
their Eddington limits. In the recently identified class of ultraluminous X-ray
pulsars, accretor is a neutron star and thus has a fairly small mass with a
small Eddington limit. The accretion disc structure around such an object
affects important observables such as equilibrium period, period derivative and
the size of the magnetosphere. We propose a model of a nearly-standard
accretion disc interacting with the magnetosphere only in a thin layer near the
inner disc rim. Our calculations show that the size of the magnetosphere may be
represented as the classical Alfv\'en radius times a dimensionless factor $\xi$
which depends on the disc thickness only. In the case of
radiation-pressure-dominated disc, the size of the magnetosphere does not
depend on the mass accretion rate. In general, increasing the disc thickness
leads to a larger magnetosphere size in units of the Alfv\'en radius. For large
enough mass accretion rates and magnetic moments, it is important to take into
account not only the pressure of the magnetic field and the radiation pressure
inside the disc, but also the pressure of the radiation produced close to the
surface of the neutron star in accretion column. The magnetospheric size may
increase by up to factor of two as a result of the effects related to the disc
thickness and the irradiation from the central source. Accounting for these
effects reduces the estimate of the neutron star magnetic moment by a factor of
several.

disappear, while the meaning of existing words can fluctuate over time. Such
dynamics are especially notable during a period of crisis. This work addresses
several important tasks of measuring, visualizing and predicting short term
text representation shift, i.e. the change in a word's contextual semantics,
and contrasting such shift with surface level word dynamics, or concept drift,
observed in social media streams. Unlike previous approaches on learning word
representations from text, we study the relationship between short-term concept
drift and representation shift on a large social media corpus - VKontakte posts
in Russian collected during the Russia-Ukraine crisis in 2014-2015. Our novel
contributions include quantitative and qualitative approaches to (1) measure
short-term representation shift and contrast it with surface level concept
drift; (2) build predictive models to forecast short-term shifts in meaning
from previous meaning as well as from concept drift; and (3) visualize
short-term representation shift for example keywords to demonstrate the
practical use of our approach to discover and track meaning of newly emerging
terms in social media. We show that short-term representation shift can be
accurately predicted up to several weeks in advance. Our unique approach to
modeling and visualizing word representation shifts in social media can be used
to explore and characterize specific aspects of the streaming corpus during
crisis events and potentially improve other downstream classification tasks
including real-time event detection.

MIMO systems. Most wireless channels are sparse with large delay spread, while
some channels can be observed having sparse common support (SCS) within a
certain area of the antenna array, i.e., the antenna array can be grouped into
several clusters according to the sparse supports of channels. The SCS property
is attractive when it comes to the estimation of large number of channels in
massive MIMO systems. Using the SCS of channels, one expects better
performance, but the number of clusters and the elements for each cluster are
always unknown in the receiver. In this paper, {the Dirichlet process} is
exploited to model such sparse channels where those in each cluster have SCS.
We proposed a low complexity message passing based sparse Bayesian learning to
perform channel estimation in massive MIMO systems by using combined BP with MF
on a factor graph. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed massive
MIMO sparse channel estimation outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
Especially, it even shows better performance than the variational Bayesian

coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and
exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition
Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework
between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph
discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by
incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each
step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level
adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence
level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial
training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with
smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative
experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative
results on telling diverse stories for an image also verify the
interpretability of RTT-GAN.

computer vision applications requiring to react as early as possible, such as
autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose a new action anticipation
method that achieves high prediction accuracy even in the presence of a very
small percentage of a video sequence. To this end, we develop a multi-stage
LSTM architecture that leverages context-aware and action-aware features, and
introduce a novel loss function that encourages the model to predict the
correct class as early as possible. Our experiments on standard benchmark
datasets evidence the benefits of our approach; We outperform the
state-of-the-art action anticipation methods for early prediction by a relative

reverberation mapping of a tidal disruption flare (TDF) ASASSN-14li. We find
that its X-ray variations are correlated with and lag the optical/UV

X-ray time lag, we rule out X-ray reprocessing and direct emission from a
standard circular thin disk as the dominant source of its optical/UV emission.
The lag magnitude also rules out an AGN disk-driven instability as the origin
of ASASSN-14li and thus strongly supports the tidal disruption picture for this
event and similar objects. We suggest that the majority of the optical/UV
emission likely originates from debris stream self-interactions. Perturbations
at the self-interaction sites produce optical/UV variability and travel down to
the black hole where they modulate the X-rays. The time lag between the
optical/UV and the X-rays variations thus correspond to the time taken by these
fluctuations to travel from the self-interaction site to close to the black
hole. We further discuss these time lags within the context of the three
variants of the self-interaction model. High-cadence monitoring observations of
future TDFs will be sensitive enough to detect these echoes and would allow us
to establish the origin of optical/UV emission in TDFs in general.

hierarchical nonparametric variational autoencoders, which combines

resulting model induces a hierarchical structure of latent semantic concepts

that once M stars start to slow down, they do so rapidly. The K2 period-color

($\sim$125 Myr) for late F, G, K, and early-M stars; the overall distribution
moves to longer periods, and is better described by 2 line segments. For mid-M
stars, the relationship has similarly broad scatter, and is steeper in
Praesepe. The diversity of lightcurves and of periodogram types is similar in

abstract solutions to recurring architectural design problems. They consist of
a description of component types and restrict component connection and

employing the pattern. Unfortunately, most documented patterns do not provide a
formal guarantee of whether their specification indeed leads to the desired
guarantee. Failure in doing so, however, might lead to wrong architectures,
i.e., architectures wrongly supposed to show certain desired properties. Since
architectures, in general, have a high impact on the quality of the resulting

repair, this may lead to badly reparable quality issues in the resulting
system. To address this problem, we propose an approach based on model checking
to verify pattern specifications w.r.t. their guarantees. In the following we
apply the approach to three well-known patterns for dynamic architectures: the
Singleton, the Model-View-Controller, and the Broker pattern. Thereby, we
discovered ambiguities and missing constraints for all three specifications.
Thus, we conclude that verifying patterns of dynamic architectures using model

$\Delta$ is varied in the range of $0.0035$ to $0.06$ of the capillary length
$l_c$. To interpret the results, we use Cox's theory which involves a
microscopic distance $r_m$ and a microscopic angle $\theta_e$. In the numerical
case, the equivalent of $\theta_e$ is the angle $\theta_\Delta$ and we find
that Cox's theory also applies. We introduce the scaling factor or gauge
function $\phi$ so that $r_m = \Delta/\phi$ and estimate this gauge function by
comparing our numerics to Cox's theory. The comparison provides a direct
assessment of the agreement of the numerics with Cox's theory and reveals a
critical feature of the numerical treatment of contact line dynamics: agreement
is poor at small angles while it is better at large angles. This scaling factor
is shown to depend only on $\theta_\Delta$ and the viscosity ratio $q$. In the
case of small $\theta_e$, we use the prediction by Eggers [Phys. Rev. Lett.,

efficient device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks
are investigated. The resource and power are optimized for maximization of the
energy efficiency (EE) of D2D communications. Exploiting the properties of
fractional programming, we transform the original nonconvex optimization
problem in fractional form into an equivalent optimization problem in
subtractive form. Then, an efficient iterative resource allocation and power
control scheme is proposed. In each iteration, part of the constraints of the
EE optimization problem is removed by exploiting the penalty function approach.
We further propose a novel two-layer approach which allows to find the optimum
at each iteration by decoupling the EE optimization problem of joint resource
allocation and power control into two separate steps. In the first layer, the
optimal power values are obtained by solving a series of maximization problems
through root-finding with or without considering the loss of cellular users'
rates. In the second layer, the formulated optimization problem belongs to a
classical resource allocation problem with single allocation format which
admits a network flow formulation so that it can be solved to optimality.
Simulation results demonstrate the remarkable improvements in terms of EE by
using the proposed iterative resource allocation and power control scheme.

allows each user optimizing its own EE. In the EGT-based power control games,
each player selects a strategy giving a higher payoff than the average payoff,
which can improve the fairness among the users. The proposed algorithm has a
linear complexity with respect to the number of subcarriers and the number of
cells in comparison with the brute force approach which has an exponential
complexity. Simulation results show the remarkable improvements in terms of

the abrupt slowdown of structural relaxation. However, it still remains elusive
whether there is an underlying link between structural relaxation and dynamic
heterogeneity. Here we unravel the link by introducing a characteristic time
scale hiding behind an identical dynamic heterogeneity for various model
glass-forming liquids. We find that the time scale corresponds to the kinetic
fragility of liquids. Moreover, it leads to scaling collapse of both the
structural relaxation time and dynamic heterogeneity for all liquids studied,
together with a characteristic temperature associated with the same dynamic
heterogeneity. Our findings imply that studying the glass transition from the
viewpoint of dynamic heterogeneity is more informative than expected.

consists of picking one card from each pile to form a new pile. In a recent
generalization, $\sigma$-Bulgarian solitaire, the number of cards you pick from
a pile is some function $\sigma$ of the pile size, such that you pick
$\sigma(h)\le h$ cards from a pile of size $h$. Here we consider a special
class of such functions. Let us call $\sigma$ well-behaved if $\sigma(1)=1$ and
if both $\sigma(h)$ and $h-\sigma(h)$ are non-decreasing functions of $h$.
Well-behaved $\sigma$-Bulgarian solitaire has a geometric interpretation in
terms of layers at certain levels being picked in each move. It also satisfies
that if a stable configuration of $n$ cards exists it is unique. Moreover, if
piles are sorted in order of decreasing size ($\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2\ge
\dots$) then a configuration is convex if and only if it is a stable
configuration of some well-behaved $\sigma$-Bulgarian solitaire. If sorted
configurations are represented by Young diagrams and scaled down to have unit
height and unit area, the stable configurations corresponding to an infinite
sequence of well-behaved functions ($\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \dots$) may tend to a
limit shape $\phi$. We show that every convex $\phi$ with certain properties
can arise as the limit shape of some sequence of well-behaved $\sigma_n$. For
the special case when $\sigma_n(h)=\lceil q_n h \rceil$ for $0 < q_n \le 1$,
these limit shapes are triangular (in case $q_n^2 n\rightarrow 0$), or
exponential (in case $q_n^2 n\rightarrow \infty$), or interpolating between
these shapes (in case $q_n^2 n\rightarrow C>0$).

observed, which are coming from Level Anti-Crossings (LACs) in a coupled
electron-nuclear spin system. For sensitive detection of such LAC-lines we use
lock-in detection to measure the photoluminescence intensity. This experimental
technique allows us to obtain new LAC lines. Additionally, a remarkably strong
dependence of the LAC-lines on the modulation frequency is found. Specifically,
upon decrease of the modulation frequency from 12 kHz to 17 Hz the amplitude of
the LAC-lines increases by approximately two orders of magnitude. To take a
quantitative account for such effects, we present a theoretical model, which
describes the spin dynamics in a coupled electron-nuclear spin system under the
action of an oscillating external magnetic field. Good agreement between
experiments and theory allows us to conclude that the observed effects are
originating from coherent spin polarization exchange in a coupled spin system
comprising the spin-polarized NV$^-$ center. Our results are of great practical
importance allowing one to optimize the experimental conditions for probing
LAC-derived lines in diamond crystals comprising NV$^-$ centers and for

galaxy of the long-duration Swift gamma-ray burst GRB 140506A at z = 0.889. The
optical and near-infrared afterglow of this GRB had a peculiar spectral energy
distribution (SED) with a strong flux-drop at 8000 {\AA} (4000 {\AA}
rest-frame) suggesting an unusually steep extinction curve. By analyzing the
contribution and physical properties of the host galaxy, we here aim at
providing additional information on the properties and origin of this steep,
non-standard extinction. We find that the strong flux-drop in the GRB afterglow
spectrum at < 8000 {\AA} and rise at < 4000 {\AA} is well explained by the
combination of a steep extinction curve along the GRB line of sight and
contamination by the host galaxy light so that the scenario with an extreme
2175 {\AA} extinction bump can be excluded. We localise the GRB to be at a
projected distance of approximately 4 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy.
Based on emission-line diagnostics of the four detected nebular lines, Halpha,
Hbeta, [O II] and [O III], we find the host to be a modestly star forming (SFR
= 1.34 +/- 0.04 Msun yr^-1) and relatively metal poor (Z = 0.35^{+0.15}_{-0.11}
Zsun) galaxy with a large dust content, characterized by a measured visual
attenuation of A_V = 1.74 +/- 0.41 mag, thus unexceptional in all its physical
properties. We model the extinction curve of the host-corrected afterglow and
show that the standard dust properties causing the reddening seen in the Local
Group are inadequate in describing the steep drop. We conclude that the steep
extinction curve seen in the afterglow towards the GRB is of exotic origin, is
sightline-dependent only and thus solely a consequence of the circumburst
environment.

effect of the electromag- netic field is only from the scalar potential and
thereby ignoring the vector potential contribution. This is a valid assumption
when the distances between objects are of the order of nanometers. Using Lorenz
gauge, the scalar field is quantized with the canonical quantization scheme,
giving rise to scalar photons. In the limit as the speed of light approaches
infinity, the theory reduces to a pure Coulomb interaction governed by the
Poisson equation. The model describes very well parallel plate capacitor
physics, where a new length scale related to its capacitance emerges. Shorter
than this length scale we see greater radiative heat transfer. This differs
markedly from the usual Rytov fluctuational electrodynamics theory in which the
enhancement is due to evanescent modes shorter than the thermal wavelengths.
Our theory may explain recent experiments where charge fluctuations instead of
current fluctuations play a dominant role in radiative heat transfer. Finally,
due to the asymmetric electron-bath couplings, thermal rectification effects
are also observed and reported.

microstructure of the medium uniquely determines the shape of all penetrating
light paths, recent theoretical insights indicate that the mean length of these

invariant with respect to a change in the mean free path. Here, we report an
experiment that demonstrates this surprising property explicitly. Using
colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, we establish
an invariance of the mean path length spanning nearly two orders of magnitude
in scattering strength, from almost transparent to very opaque media. This very

lead the hard by $\sim$4 ks, with a broad continuum-like profile in the lag

is dominated by a separate low temperature, optically thick Comptonisation
component rather than relativistic reflection or a jet. This soft X-ray
emitting region is several tens or hundreds of $R_{g}$ away from the hot corona

densities and the [12CO]/[13CO] abundance ratio. For Arp 55, an
early/intermediate staged merger, the line measurements are consistent with
cold (~10-20 K), dense (>10$^{3.5}$ cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas. For NGC 2623, the
molecular gas is warmer (~110 K) and less dense (~10$^{2.7}$ cm$^{-3}$). Since
Arp 55 is an early/intermediate stage merger while NGC 2623 is a merger
remnant, the difference in physical conditions may be an indicator of merger
stage. Comparing the temperature and volume density of several LIRGs shows that
the molecular gas, averaged over ~kpc scale, of advanced mergers is in general
warmer and less dense than early/intermediate stage mergers. We also find that
the [12CO]/[13CO] abundance ratio of NGC 2623 is unusually high (>250) when
compared to the Milky Way; however, it follows a trend seen with other LIRGs in
literature. This high [12CO]/[13CO] value is very likely due to stellar
nucleosynthesis enrichment of the interstellar medium. On the other hand, Arp
55 has a more Galactic [12CO]/[13CO] value with the most probable [12CO]/[13CO]
value being 20-30. We measure the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, $\alpha_{CO}$, to
be ~0.1 and ~0.7 (3x10$^{-4}$/x$_{CO}$) M$_{\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$

ExtraTree is proposed to efficiently estimate the Green's function of a

the collisional angular momentum, e.g., reactive scattering resonances and
tunneling through centrifugal barriers. Additionally, the dynamics of
ultralow-energy collisions is dominated by long-range interactions, i.e.,
""universal"" chemical forces. Thus, experiments in this domain probe the details
of intermolecular interactions which is of general relevance for the
understanding of chemical processes. Moreover, the increasingly more precise
experiments provide valuable data for benchmarking theoretical models and
quantum-chemical calculations. Studies of cold ion-neutral reactions in the
laboratory rely on techniques for the generation of cold ions and cold
neutrals. Many of these techniques do not only allow the translational cooling
of the molecules, but also a precise reparation of their internal quantum
state. Thus, by an accurate preparation of both the energy and state of the
reaction partners as well as by the application of external electric, magnetic

an unprecedented level of accuracy. In this chapter, we will review salient
theoretical concepts and recent experimental developments for studies of

proposal aims to improve the hierarchy sensitivity of T2HK by placing one of
the two tanks of the HK detector at a site in Korea, to collect data at $\sim

$\sim 1300$ km, we explore whether it is advantageous to collect additional
long-baseline data as proposed with T2HKK, or to enhance the
$\delta_{CP}$-precision with the `conventional' T2HK by keeping both detector
tanks in Japan. We do this by comparing the physics reach of these two options
in conjunction with DUNE. We find that DUNE+T2HKK is better at excluding the
wrong hierarchy, reaching $\Delta\chi^2 > 175$ irrespective of the true
parameters. While DUNE+T2HK can measure $\delta_{CP}$ with more precision in
some parts of the parameter space, both DUNE+T2HK and DUNE+T2HKK perform
equally well near the current best-fit point, giving a $\delta_{CP}$ width of
around $15^\circ$. The T2HKK setup allows us to correlate and constrain the
systematic errors between the two detectors collecting data from the same

Such a reduction of the systematic errors is crucial for determining the

to direct localisation that can be placed on a map, which enables spatial
analysis and cross-referencing. Many efficient geocoders exist for current
addresses, but they do not deal with the temporal aspect and are based on a
strict hierarchy (..., city, street, house number) that is hard or impossible
to use with historical data. Indeed historical data are full of uncertainties
(temporal aspect, semantic aspect, spatial precision, confidence in historical
source, ...) that can not be resolved, as there is no way to go back in time to
check. We propose an open source, open data, extensible solution for geocoding
that is based on the building of gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects
extracted from historical topographical maps. Once the gazetteers are
available, geocoding an historical address is a matter of finding the
geohistorical object in the gazetteers that is the best match to the historical
address. The matching criteriae are customisable and include several dimensions
(fuzzy semantic, fuzzy temporal, scale, spatial precision ...). As the goal is
to facilitate historical work, we also propose web-based user interfaces that
help geocode (one address or batch mode) and display over current or historical
topographical maps, so that they can be checked and collaboratively edited. The
system is tested on Paris city for the 19-20th centuries, shows high returns

  in Distributed Sensor Networks",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces PriMaL, a general PRIvacy-preserving MAchine-Learning
method for reducing the privacy cost of information transmitted through a
network. Distributed sensor networks are often used for automated
classification and detection of abnormal events in high-stakes situations, e.g.
fire in buildings, earthquakes, or crowd disasters. Such networks might
transmit privacy-sensitive information, e.g. GPS location of smartphones, which
might be disclosed if the network is compromised. Privacy concerns might slow
down the adoption of the technology, in particular in the scenario of social
sensing where participation is voluntary, thus solutions are needed which
improve privacy without compromising on the event detection accuracy. PriMaL is
implemented as a machine-learning layer that works on top of an existing event
detection algorithm. Experiments are run in a general simulation framework, for
several network topologies and parameter values. The privacy footprint of
state-of-the-art event detection algorithms is compared within the proposed
framework. Results show that PriMaL is able to reduce the privacy cost of a
distributed event detection algorithm below that of the corresponding
centralized algorithm, within the bounds of some assumptions about the
protocol. Moreover the performance of the distributed algorithm is not
statistically worse than that of the centralized algorithm.

the construction is more or less phenomenological, where the non-canonical

we derive the form of the Lagrangian from a superconformal action and it turns
out to be exactly of the same form as in the first approach. Conformal breaking
of these theories results in a new class of non-canonical models which can
govern inflation with modulated shape of the T-models. We further employ this
framework to explore inflationary phenomenology with a representative example

non-canonical models using the latest confidence contour in the $n_s-r$ plane

the same outage probability is achieved in these setups. The results show the

effectively improve the outage probability/energy efficiency, and compensate
the effect of hardware impairments in RF-FSO networks. For common parameter
settings of the RF-FSO dual-hop networks, outage probability 10^{-4} and code

optimum while our algorithm always converges to the globally optimal
variational lower bound. We characterize the loss incurred by choosing a
non-optimal variational approximation distribution suggesting that selection of
the approximating variational distribution deserves as much attention as the
selection of the original statistical model for a given data set.

nuclear norm relaxations. It is well known that this approach can be guaranteed
to recover a near optimal solutions if a so called restricted isometry property

which results in a shrinking bias which can degrade the solution.
  In this paper we study an alternative non-convex regularization term. This
formulation does not penalize elements that are larger than a certain threshold
making it much less prone to small solutions. Our main theoretical results show
that if a RIP holds then the stationary points are often well separated, in the
sense that their differences must be of high cardinality/rank. Thus, with a
suitable initial solution the approach is unlikely to fall into a bad local

better solution than standard $\ell_1$/nuclear-norm relaxation even when
starting from trivial initializations. In many cases our results can also be

potential sources for extensive asteroid shape and spin modelling. Individual
lightcurve inversion models require several apparitions and hundreds of data
points per target. However, we can analyse the coarse shape and spin
distributions over populations of at least thousands of targets even if there
are only a few points and one apparition per asteroid. This is done by
examining the distribution of the brightness variations observed within the
chosen population.
  Aims. Brightness variation has been proposed as a population-scale rather
than individual-target observable in two studies so far. We aim to examine this
approach rigorously to establish its theoretical validity, degree of
ill-posedness, and practical applicability.
  Methods. We model the observed brightness variation of a target population by
considering its cumulative distribution function (CDF) caused by the joint
distribution function of two fundamental shape and spin indicators. These are
the shape elongation and the spin latitude of a simple ellipsoidal model. The
main advantage of the model is that we can derive analytical basis functions
that yield the observed CDF as a function of the shape and spin distribution.
The inverse problem can be treated linearly. Even though the inaccuracy of the
model is considerable, databases of thousands of targets should yield some
information on the distribution.
  Results. We establish the theoretical soundness and the typical accuracy
limits of the approach both analytically and numerically. Using simulations, we
derive a practical estimate of the model distribution in the (shape,
spin)-plane. We show that databases such as Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) yield coarse but robust estimates of this distribution, and as an
example compare various asteroid families with each other.

generate a good estimate of scatter however, then image accuracy can be
retained. In the context of adaptive radiotherapy, one usually has a
low-scatter planning CT image of the same patient at an earlier time.
Correcting for scatter in the subsequent CBCT scan can either be self
consistent with the new measurements or exploit the prior image, and there are
several recent methods that report high accuracy with the latter. In this
study, we will look at the accuracy of various scatter estimation methods, how
they can be effectively incorporated into a statistical reconstruction
algorithm, along with introducing a method for matching off-line Monte-Carlo
(MC) prior estimates to the new measurements. Conclusions we draw from testing
on a neck cancer patient are: statistical reconstruction that incorporates the
scatter estimate significantly outperforms analytic and iterative methods with
pre-correction; and although the most accurate scatter estimates can be made
from the MC on planning image, they only offer a slight advantage over the

of what role materials play in interaction design and participatory design
processes. The dissertation aims at developing conceptual tools, based on
Deweys pragmatism, for understanding how materials aid design reflection.
  It has been developed using a research-through-design approach in which the
author has conducted practical design work in order to investigate and
experiment with using materials to scaffold design inquiry. The results of the
PhD work is submitted as seven separate papers, submitted to esteemed journals
and conferences within the field of interaction design and HCI.
  The work is motivated both by the growing interest in materials in
interaction design and HCI and the interest in design processes and
collaboration within those fields. At the core of the dissertation lies an
interest in the many different materials used during the design process:
sketches, prototypes as well as the materials we shape products out of:
physical and digital materials now form a unity of computation and physical
materials that has given rise to a new research interest in design and
materiality.
  The main results from the dissertation are an understanding of design
materials that draws on pragmatist philosophy. The papers and overview article
highlights how materials in a pragmatist perspective are more than the matter
out of which we shape an idea. Rather they structure the entire process of
inquiry, helping us frame problems, inspire solutions and try out these
solutions in practice. This framework, developed in several of the submitted
papers, is tested and illustrated through a series of experimental design
cases.

observations from MHD models have previously concentrated on the scale of
molecular clouds. Here we extend the model comparisons to kiloparsec scales,
taking into account hot shocked gas generated by supernovae, and a non-uniform
dynamo-generated magnetic field at both large and small scales down to 4 pc
spatial resolution. Radiative transfer calculations are used to model dust
emission and polarization on the top of MHD simulations. We compute synthetic
maps of column density $N_H$, polarization fraction $p$, and polarization angle
dispersion $S$, and study their dependencies on the important properties of the
MHD simulations. These include the large-scale magnetic field and its
orientation, the small-scale magnetic field, and supernova-driven shocks.
Similar filament-like structures of $S$ as seen in the Planck all-sky maps are
visible in our synthetic results, although the smallest scale structures are
absent from our maps. Supernova-driven shock fronts and $S$ do not show
significant correlation. Instead, $S$ can clearly be attributed to the
distribution of the small-scale magnetic field. We also find that the
large-scale magnetic field influences the polarization properties, such that,
for a given strength of magnetic fluctuation, a strong plane-of-the-sky mean
field weakens the observed $S$, while strengthening $p$. The anticorrelation of
$p$ and $S$, and decreasing $p$ as a function of $N_H$ are consistent across
all synthetic observations. The magnetic fluctuations follow an exponential
distribution, rather than Gaussian, characteristic of flows with intermittent
repetitive shocks. The observed polarization properties and column densities
are sensitive to the line of sight distance over which the emission is
integrated.

properties of microstrain-controlled Bi1-xCaxFe1-yTiyO3-delta (y = 0 and x = y)

200 nm. A complex interdependence of doping concentration (x or y), annealing
temperature (T), microstrain (epsilon) and particle size (d) is established.
X-ray diffraction studies reveal a linear variation of microstrain with inverse
particle size, 1/d nm-1 (i.e. epsilon.d = 16.5 nm.%). A rapid increase in the
saturation magnetization below a critical size dc ~ 35 nm, exhibiting a

microstrain. We propose an empirical formula M is proportional to
(1/d)epsilon^beta (beta ~ 1.6) to highlight the contributions from both the
size and microstrain towards the total magnetization in the doped systems. The
magnetization observed in nanoparticles is thus, a result of competing magnetic
contribution from the terminated spin cycloid on the surface and counteracting
microstrain present at a given size. Large magnetodielectric response of ~ 9.5

concentration, revealing a strong correlation between magnetic and

cores against gravitational collapse.
  Methods. We combine chemical and radiative transfer simulations in the
context of a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere to model the effect of chemistry on
the gas temperature, and study the effect of temperature changes on core
stability.
  Results. We find that chemistry has in general very little effect on the
nondimensional radius $\xi_{\rm out}$ which parametrizes the core stability.
Cores that are initially stable or unstable tend to stay near their initial
states, in terms of stability (i.e., $\xi_{\rm out} \sim$ constant), as the
chemistry develops. This result is independent of the initial conditions. We
can however find solutions where $\xi_{\rm out}$ decreases at late times ($t
\gtrsim 10^6 \, \rm yr$) which correspond to increased stabilization caused by
the chemistry. Even though the core stability is unchanged by the chemistry in
most of the models considered here, we cannot rule out the possibility that a
core can evolve from an unstable to a stable state owing to chemical evolution.
The reverse case, where an initially stable core becomes ultimately unstable,
seems highly unlikely.
  Conclusions. Our results indicate that chemistry should be properly accounted
for in studies of star-forming regions, and that further investigations of core
stability especially with hydrodynamical models are warranted.

determining which are useful. Here, a useful model is considered as one that is
capable of combining data and expert knowledge, through an inversion or
calibration process, to adequately characterize the uncertainty in predictions
of interest. This paper derives conditions that specify which simplified models
are useful and how they should be calibrated. To start, the notion of an
optimal simplification is defined. This relates the model simplifications to
the nature of the data and predictions, and determines when a standard
probabilistic calibration scheme is capable of accurately characterizing
uncertainty. Furthermore, two additional conditions are defined for suboptimal
models that determine when the simplifications can be safely ignored. The first
allows a suboptimally simplified model to be used in a way that replicates the
performance of an optimal model. This is achieved through the judicial
selection of a prior term for the calibration process that explicitly includes
the nature of the data, predictions and modelling simplifications. The second
considers the dependency structure between the predictions and the available
data to gain insights into when the simplifications can be overcome by using
the right calibration data. Furthermore, the derived conditions are related to
the commonly used calibration schemes based on Tikhonov and subspace
regularization. To allow concrete insights to be obtained, the analysis is
performed under a linear expansion of the model equations and where the
predictive uncertainty is characterized via second order moments only.

comparatively small, our formulation is particularly suited for a
linearly-scaling NEVPT2 implementation. Some of the NEVPT2 energy contributions
can be formulated completely in the AO basis as single-reference second-order
M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory and benefit from sparse active-pseudo
density matrices - particularly if the active molecular orbitals are localized
only in parts of a molecule. Furthermore, we show that for multi-reference
perturbation theories it is particularly challenging to find optimal parameters
of the numerical Laplace transformation as the fit range may vary among the 8
different OEDs by many orders of magnitude. Selecting the number of quadrature
points for each OED separately according to an accuracy-based criterion allows
us to control the errors in the NEVPT2 energies reliably.

closed cavity built of an array of elementary harmonic oscillators with
negative mutual couplings exhibits a dispersion curve with lower order modes
corresponding to higher frequencies. Such cavity arrays may help to achieve
large mode volumes for boosting sensitivity of the axion searches, where the
mode volume for the composed array scales proportional to the number of
elements, but the frequency remains constant.
  The negatively coupled cavity array is demonstrated with magnetically
coupling coils, where the sign of next-neighbour coupling (controlled with
their chirality) sets the dispersion curve properties of the resonator array
medium. Furthermore, we show that similar effects can be achieved using only
positively coupled cavities of different frequencies assembled in periodic
cells. This principle is demonstrated for the multi-post re-entrant system,
which can be realised with an array of straight metallic rods organised in
chiral structures.

such information is hidden in the energy shift $\Delta E$ of the two nucleons
on the lattice. We carry out this sanity check for all the lattice results in
the literature claiming the existence of the $NN$ bound state(s) for heavy
quark masses, and find that (i) some of the $NN$ data show clear inconsistency
between the behavior of ERE at $k^2 > 0$ and that at $k^2 < 0$, (ii) some of

the divergent effective range) at $k^2<0$, (iii) some of the $NN$ data have the
unphysical residue for the bound state pole in S-matrix, and (iv) the rest of

caution of using the ERE in the case of the multiple bound states. Our finding,

constantly increasing, due to initiatives such as Open Data and Open Government
Data, among other ones. Models, languages, and tools, that allow to obtain
valuable information efficiently, are thus required. Multidimensional data are
typically represented as data cubes, and exploited using Online Analytical
Processing (OLAP) techniques. The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, also denoted QB, is
the current W3C standard to represent statistical data on the SW.Since QB does
not include key features needed for OLAP analysis, in previous work we have
proposed an extension, denoted QB4OLAP, to overcome this problem without the
need of modifying already published data. Once data cubes are represented on
the SW, we need tools to analyze them. However, writing efficient analytical
queries over SW cubes demands a deep knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. These skills
are not common in typical analytical users. Also, OLAP languages like MDX are
far from being easily understood by the final user. The lack of friendly tools
to exploit multidimensional data on the SW is a barrier that needs to be broken
to promote the publication of such data. We address this problem in this paper.
Our approach is based on allowing analytical users to write queries using OLAP
operations over cubes, without dealing with SW standards. For this, we devised
CQL (standing for Cube Query Language), a simple, high-level query language
that operates over cubes. Using the metadata provided by QB4OLAP, we translate
CQL queries into SPARQL. Then, we propose query improvement strategies to
produce efficient SPARQL queries, adapting SPARQL query optimization
techniques. We evaluate our approach using the Star-Schema benchmark, showing
that our proposal outperforms others. A web application that allows querying SW
data cubes using CQL, completes our contributions.

of integrable $(1+1)$-dimensional PDEs. According to the preprint
arXiv:1212.2199, for any given $(1+1)$-dimensional evolution PDE one can define
a sequence of Lie algebras $F^p$, $p=0,1,2,3,\dots$, such that representations
of these algebras classify all ZCRs of the PDE up to local gauge equivalence.
ZCRs depending on derivatives of arbitrary finite order are allowed.
Furthermore, these algebras provide necessary conditions for existence of
Backlund transformations between two given PDEs. The algebras $F^p$ are defined
in arXiv:1212.2199 in terms of generators and relations.
  In the present paper, we describe some methods to study the structure of the
algebras $F^p$ for multicomponent $(1+1)$-dimensional evolution PDEs. Using
these methods, we compute the explicit structure (up to non-essential nilpotent
ideals) of the Lie algebras $F^p$ for the Landau-Lifshitz, nonlinear
Schrodinger equations, and for the $n$-component Landau-Lifshitz system of
Golubchik and Sokolov for any $n>3$. In particular, this means that for the
$n$-component Landau-Lifshitz system we classify all ZCRs (depending on
derivatives of arbitrary finite order), up to local gauge equivalence and up to
killing nilpotent ideals in the corresponding Lie algebras.
  The presented methods to classify ZCRs can be applied also to other
$(1+1)$-dimensional evolution PDEs. Furthermore, the obtained results can be
used for proving non-existence of Backlund transformations between some PDEs,

re-ID embedding and at the same time predicts pedestrian attributes. We
manually annotate attribute labels for two large-scale re-ID datasets, and
systematically investigate how person re-ID and attribute recognition benefit
from each other. In addition, we re-weight the attribute predictions
considering the dependencies and correlations among the attributes. The
experimental results on two large-scale re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that by
learning a more discriminative representation, APR achieves competitive re-ID
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We use APR to speed up
the retrieval process by ten times with a minor accuracy drop of 2.92% on

the regularity property of a given boundary value problem $(P, C)$ is
equivalent to the uniform regularity of the natural family $(P_x, C_x)$ of
associated boundary value problems in local coordinates. We verify that this
property is satisfied for the Dirichlet boundary conditions and strongly
elliptic operators via a compactness argument. We then introduce a uniform
Shapiro-Lopatinski regularity condition, which is a modification of the
classical one, and we prove that it characterizes the boundary value problems
that satisfy the usual regularity property. We also show that the natural Robin
boundary conditions always satisfy the uniform Shapiro-Lopatinski regularity
condition, provided that our operator satisfies the strong Legendre condition.
This is achieved by proving that ""well-posedness implies regularity"" via a
modification of the classical ""Nirenberg trick"". When combining our regularity
results with the Poincare inequality of (Ammann-Grosse-Nistor, preprint 2015),
one obtains the usual well-posedness results for the classical boundary value
problems in the usual scale of Sobolev spaces, thus extending these important,
well-known theorems from smooth, bounded domains, to manifolds with boundary
and bounded geometry. As we show in several examples, these results do not hold
true anymore if one drops the bounded geometry assumption. We also introduce a
uniform Agmon condition and show that it is equivalent to the coerciveness.
Consequently, we prove a well-posedness result for parabolic equations whose
elliptic generator satisfies the uniform Agmon condition.

qualitatively consistent with the current diverting effect from a more

at the sampling nodes. We develop construction methods for multiple rank-1
lattices that allow for this unique reconstruction and for estimates of the
number $M$ of distinct sampling nodes within the resulting spatial
discretizations. Assuming that the multivariate trigonometric polynomial under
consideration is a linear combination of $T$ trigonometric monomials, the
oversampling factor $M/T$ is independent of the spatial dimension and, roughly
speaking, with high probability only logarithmic in $T$, which is much better
than the oversampling factor that is expected when using one single rank-1
lattice.
  The newly developed approaches for the construction of spatial
discretizations are probabilistic methods. The arithmetic complexity of these
algorithms depend only linearly on the spatial dimension and, with high
probability, only linearly on $T$ up to some logarithmic factors.
  Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexities of the resulting FFT
algorithms in detail and obtain upper bounds in $\mathcal{O}\left(M\log
M\right)$, where the constants depend only linearly on the spatial dimension.
With high probability, we construct spatial discretizations where $M/T\le C\log
T$ holds, which implies that the complexity of the corresponding FFT converts
to $\mathcal{O}\left(T\log^2 T\right)$.

  and evolution","submitted to MNRAS, 7 pages, comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stx2208",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Molecular clouds are to a great extent influenced by turbulent motions in the
gas. Numerical and observational studies indicate that the star formation rate
and efficiency crucially depend on the mixture of solenoidal and compressive
modes in the turbulent acceleration field, which can be quantified by the
turbulent driving parameter b. For purely solenoidal (divergence-free) driving
previous studies showed that b=1/3 and for entirely compressive (curl-free)
driving b=1. In this study, we determine the evolution of the turbulent driving
parameter b in magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular cloud formation
and evolution. The clouds form due to the convergence of two flows of warm
neutral gas. We explore different scenarios by varying the magnitude of the
initial turbulent perturbations in the flows. We show that the driving mode of
the turbulence within the cloud strongly fluctuates with time and exhibits no
clear correlation with typical cloud properties, such as the cloud mass and the
(Alfven) Mach number. We specifically find that $b$ strongly varies from b=0.3
to b=0.8 on timescales t<5 Myr, where the timescale and range of variation can
change from cloud to cloud. This rapid change of b from solenoidal to
compressive driving is primarily associated with global contraction of the
cloud and subsequent onset of star formation. We conclude that the effective
turbulence driving parameter should be treated as a free parameter that can
vary from solenoidal to compressive in both time and space.

  Results: Within the inner few 1000AU, G351.77 fragments into at least four

around the main submm source #1 with a diameter of ~0.5"" does not show
additional fragmentation. While the CO(6-5) line wing emission shows an outflow
lobe in the north-western direction emanating from source #1, the dense gas
tracer CH3CN shows a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow that is
indicative of rotational motions. Absorption profile measurements against the
submm source #2 indicate infall rates on the order of 10^{-4} to
10^{-3}M_sun/yr which can be considered as an upper limit of the mean accretion
rates. The position-velocity diagrams are consistent with a central rotating
disk-like structure embedded in an infalling envelope, but they may also be
influenced by the outflow. Using the CH_3CN(37_k-36_k) k-ladder with excitation
temperatures up to 1300K, we derive a gas temperature map of source #1
exhibiting temperatures often in excess of 1000K. Brightness temperatures of
the submm continuum never exceed 200K. This discrepancy between gas
temperatures and submm dust brightness temperatures (in the optically thick

pixel-by-pixel Toomre gravitational stability analysis of the central rotating

possibility of continuation of the obtained smooth solution to the EH an RH

introducing an arbitrary small effective volume viscosity. A new analytic

effect of a compressible medium and also the sufficient condition of positive

amplitude as an expansion in powers of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_Z\,$, where the
leading terms contain convolutions of perturbatively calculable hard functions
with the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes of the meson. We find
that power corrections to these leading terms are negligible since they are
suppressed by the small ratio $(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_Z)^2\,$.
Renormalization-group effects play a crucial role as they render our
theoretical predictions less sensitive to the hadronic input parameters which
are currently not known very precisely. Thus, measurements of the decays $Z\to
M\gamma$ at the LHC or a future lepton collider provide a theoretically very
clean way to test the QCD factorization approach. The special case where
$M=\eta^({}'{}^)$ is complicated by the fact that the decay amplitude receives
an additional contribution where the meson is formed from a two-gluon state.
The corresponding branching ratios are very sensitive to the hadronic
parameters describing the $\eta-\eta'$ system. Future measurements of these
decays could yield interesting information about these parameters and the gluon
distribution amplitude.

the difference between its due date and the completion time of its bin. The

  The paper proposes a tight lower bound that enhances an existing bound on
Lmax for 24.07% of the benchmark instances and matches it in 30.87% cases. In
addition, it models the problem using mixed integer programming (MIP), and
solves small-sized instances exactly using CPLEX. It approximately solves
larger-sized instances using a two-stage heuristic. The first stage constructs
an initial solution via a first-fit heuristic that applies an iterative
constraint programming (CP)-based neighborhood search. The second stage, which
is iterative too, approximately solves a series of assignment low-level MIPs
that are guided by feasibility constraints. It then enhances the solution via a
high-level random local search. The approximate approach improves existing
upper bounds by 27.45% on average, and obtains the optimum for 33.93% of the
instances. Overall, the exact and approximate approaches identify the optimum
for 39.07% cases.
  The proposed approach is applicable to complex problems. It applies CP and
MIP sequentially, while exploring their advantages, and hybridizes heuristic
search with MIP. It embeds a new lookahead strategy that guards against
infeasible search directions and constrains the search to improving directions
only; thus, differs from traditional lookahead beam searches.

nowadays for high dimensional data. It aims to estimate the central subspace

large-$p$-small-$n$ problem we propose a new approach for SDR. Our method
combines the following ideas for high dimensional data analysis: (1) Randomly
partition the covariates into subsets and use distance correlation (DC) to
construct a sketch of envelope subspace with low dimension. (2) Obtain a sketch
of the CS by applying conventional SDR method within the constructed envelope
subspace. (3) Repeat the above two steps for a few times and integrate these
multiple sketches to form the final estimate of the CS. We name the proposed
SDR procedure ""integrated random-partition SDR (iRP-SDR)"". Comparing with
existing methods, iRP-SDR is less affected by the selection of tuning
parameters. Moreover, the estimation procedure of iRP-SDR does not involve the
determination of the structural dimension until at the last stage, which makes
the method more robust in a high-dimensional setting. Asymptotic properties of
iRP-SDR are also established. The advantageous performance of the proposed
method is demonstrated via simulation studies and the EEG data analysis.

The goal is to augment $T$ by a minimum cost edge set $J \subseteq E$ such that
$T \cup J$ is $2$-edge-connected. We obtain the following results.
  Recently, Adjiashvili [SODA 17] introduced a novel LP for the problem and
used it to break the $2$-approximation barrier for instances when the maximum
cost $M$ of an edge in $E$ is bounded by a constant; his algorithm computes a
$1.96418+\epsilon$ approximate solution in time $n^{{(M/\epsilon^2)}^{O(1)}}$.
Using a simpler LP, we achieve ratio $\frac{12}{7}+\epsilon$ in time
$2^{O(M/\epsilon^2)} poly(n)$.This gives ratio better than $2$ for logarithmic
costs, and not only for constant costs.
  One of the oldest open questions for the problem is whether for unit costs
(when $M=1$) the standard LP-relaxation, so called Cut-LP, has integrality gap
less than $2$. We resolve this open question by proving that for unit costs the
integrality gap of the Cut-LP is at most $28/15=2-2/15$. In addition, we will
prove that another natural LP-relaxation, that is much simpler than the ones in
previous work, has integrality gap at most $7/4$.

\varepsilon^ia_i$. In this paper we will solve for $n=1,2,\ldots,9$ an old
conjecture stating that of the $2^n$ sums of the form $\sum\pm a_i$ it is
impossible that there are more with $|\sum_{i=1}^n \pm a_i|>1$ than there are
with $|\sum_{i=1}^n \pm a_i|\leq1$. Although the problem has been solved
completely in case the $a_i$'s are equal, the more general problem with
possible non-equal $a_i$'s remains open for values of $n\geq 10$. The present
method can also be used for $n\geq 10$, but unfortunately the technical
difficulties seem to grow exponentially with $n$ and no ""induction type of
argument"" has been found. The conjecture has an appealing reformulation in
probability theory and in geometry. In probability theory the results lead to
upper bounds which are much better than for instance Chebyshevnequalities.

continuity equation and the equation of state and linearise them. As an example
we study several different velocity profiles: the so-called Rankine vortex
model; the Burgers-Rott vortex model; Sullivan and modified Sullivan vortex
models. It has been shown that in the two dimensional Rankine vortex model no
instability appears in the inner region of a tornado. On the contrary, outside
this area the physical system undergoes strong exponential instability. We have
found that initially perturbed velocity components lead to amplified sound wave
excitations. The similar results have been shown in Burgers-Rott vortex model
as well. As it was numerically estimated, in this case, the unstable wave
increases its energy by a factor of $400$ only in $\sim 0.5$min. According to
the numerical study, in Sullivan and modified Sullivan models, the instability
does not differ much by the growth. Despite the fact that in the inner area the
exponential instability does not appear in a purely two dimensional case, we
have found that in the modified Sullivan vortex even a small contribution from
vertical velocities can drive unstable nonmodal waves.

style transfer) can be posed as 'manipulating' an input image into a
corresponding output image given a user-specified guiding signal. A holy-grail
solution towards generic image manipulation should be able to efficiently alter
an input image with any personalized signals (even signals unseen during
training), such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes.
However, existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process
multiple signals (let alone generalize to unseen signals), or unable to handle
signals from other modalities. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
address the zero-shot image manipulation task. We cast this problem as
manipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key
parameters can be conditionally generated from any guiding signal (even unseen
ones). To this end, we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net (ZM-Net), a
fully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an
image-transformation network (TNet) and a parameter network (PNet). The PNet
learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding
signal while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to
both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters
from the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform
high-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of guiding
signals (e.g. style images and attributes) in real-time (tens of milliseconds
per image) even for unseen signals. Moreover, a large-scale style dataset with
over 20,000 style images is also constructed to promote further research.

these algorithms require using specific families of reward functions and

gradient-based optimization algorithm with a parallel, black-box algorithm that
takes into account the model uncertainties. We demonstrate the performance of
our new algorithm on two standard control benchmark problems (in simulation)

the identification in large databases of fingerprints. Fingerprints are grouped

the fingerprint image, frequently based on visual characteristics. In this

neural networks, which avoid the necessity of an explicit feature extraction
process by incorporating the image processing within the training of the

low-quality fingerprints that are rejected by commonly used algorithms, such as
FingerCode. The study gives special importance to the robustness of the
classification for different impressions of the same fingerprint, aiming to
minimize the penetration in the database. In our experiments, convolutional
neural networks yielded better accuracy and penetration rate than

that the planar zeros of the five-point amplitude do not enjoy projective
invariance, coupling scalars to gauge fields gives rise to tree-level
amplitudes whose planar zeros are determined by homogeneous polynomials in the
stereographic coordinates labelling the direction of flight of the outgoing
particles. In the case of pure gauge theories, this projective structure is
generically destroyed if string corrections are taken into account. Scattering
amplitudes of two scalars with graviton emission vanish exactly in the planar
limit, whereas planar graviton amplitudes are zero for helicity violating
configurations. These results are corrected by string effects, computed using
the single-valued projection, which render the planar amplitude nonzero.
Finally, we discuss how the structure of planar zeros can be derived from the
soft limit behavior of the scattering amplitudes.

the so-called generalized negative binomial (GNB) distributions that are mixed
Poisson distributions in which the mixing laws belong to the class of
generalized gamma (GG) distributions. The latter was introduced by E. W. Stacy
as a special family of lifetime distributions containing gamma, exponential
power and Weibull distributions. These distributions seem to be very promising
in the statistical description of many real phenomena being very convenient and
almost universal models for the description of statistical regularities in
discrete data. Analytic properties of GNB distributions are studied. A GG
distribution is proved to be a mixed exponential distribution if and only if
the shape and exponent power parameters are no greater than one. The mixing
distribution is written out explicitly as a scale mixture of strictly stable
laws concentrated on the nonnegative halfline. As a corollary, the
representation is obtained for the GNB distribution as a mixed geometric
distribution. The corresponding scheme of Bernoulli trials with random
probability of success is considered. Within this scheme, a random analog of
the Poisson theorem is proved establishing the convergence of mixed binomial
distributions to mixed Poisson laws. Limit theorems are proved for random sums
of independent random variables in which the number of summands has the GNB
distribution and the summands have both light- and heavy-tailed distributions.
The class of limit laws is wide enough and includes the so-called generalized
variance gamma distributions. Various representations for the limit laws are
obtained in terms of mixtures of Mittag-Leffler, Linnik or Laplace
distributions. Some applications of GNB distributions in meteorology are
discussed.

statistical learning. By construction, they yield solutions with few non-zero
coefficients, which correspond to saturated constraints in the dual
optimization formulation. Working set (WS) strategies are generic optimization
techniques that consist in solving simpler problems that only consider a subset
of constraints, whose indices form the WS. Working set methods therefore
involve two nested iterations: the outer loop corresponds to the definition of
the WS and the inner loop calls a solver for the subproblems. For the Lasso
estimator a WS is a set of features, while for a Group Lasso it refers to a set
of groups. In practice, WS are generally small in this context so the
associated feature Gram matrix can fit in memory. Here we show that the
Gauss-Southwell rule (a greedy strategy for block coordinate descent
techniques) leads to fast solvers in this case. Combined with a working set
strategy based on an aggressive use of so-called Gap Safe screening rules, we
propose a solver achieving state-of-the-art performance on sparse learning
problems. Results are presented on Lasso and multi-task Lasso estimators.

CA randomizes an initial probability measure if its iterated images weak
*-converge towards the uniform Bernoulli measure (the Haar measure in this

for abelian CA with scalar or commuting coefficients. Second, we exhibit
examples of strong randomizers, i.e. abelian CA randomizing in simple
convergence; this is the first proof of this behaviour to our knowledge. We
show however that no CA with commuting coefficients can be strongly
randomizing. Finally, we show that some abelian CA achieve partial
randomization without being randomizing: the distribution of short finite words
tends to the uniform distribution up to some threshold, but this convergence
fails for larger words. Again this phenomenon cannot happen for abelian CA with

form a batch, whose processing and completion times depend on its assigned

objective is to find a cutting plan that minimizes the weighted sum of

CP is an impact-based search strategy, implemented in the general-purpose

repeated negotiations between the set of agents representing the items and the

environment, exhibits high probability of frost formation due to freezing

to the considerable thermal resistance of ice. Here we report a novel strategy
to delay ice nucleation on these types of solid-water vapor interfaces. With a
process-driven mechanism, a self-generated liquid intervening layer immiscible
to water, is deposited on a textured superhydrophobic surface and acts as a
barrier between the water vapor and the solid substrate. This liquid layer
imparts remarkable slippery conditions resulting in high mobility of condensing
water droplets. A large increase of the ensuing ice coverage time is shown
compared to the cases of standard smooth hydrophilic or textured
superhydrophobic surfaces. During deicing of these self-impregnating surfaces
we show an impressive tendency of ice fragments to skate expediting defrosting.
Robustness of such surfaces is also demonstrated by operating them under
subcooling for at least 490hr without a marked degradation. This is attributed

efficient techniques for formal verification is Counterexample-Guided
Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), which reduces the complexity of systems by
automatically building and refining abstractions. In our paper we present a
novel adaptation of the CEGAR approach to hierarchical statechart models. First
we introduce an encoding of the statechart to logical formulas that preserves
information about the state hierarchy. Based on this encoding we propose
abstraction and refinement techniques that utilize the hierarchical structure
of statecharts and also handle variables in the model. The encoding allows us
to use SMT solvers for the systematic exploration and verification of the
abstract model, including also bounded model checking. We demonstrate the
applicability and efficiency of our abstraction techniques with measurements on
an industry-motivated example.

previous authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form. In this paper we
introduce simpler Eulerian variational principles from which all the relevant
equations of non-barotropic MHD can be derived for certain field topologies.
  The variational principle is given in terms of five independent functions for
non-stationary non-barotropic flows. This is less then the eight variables
which appear in the standard equations of barotropic MHD which are the magnetic
field $\vec B$ the velocity field $\vec v$, the entropy $s$ and the density
$\rho$.
  The case of non-barotropic MHD in which the internal energy is a function of
both entropy and density was not discussed in previous works which were
concerned with the simplistic barotropic case. It is important to understand
the rule of entropy and temperature for the variational analysis of MHD. Thus
we introduce a variational principle of non-barotropic MHD and show that five
functions will suffice to describe this physical system.
  We will also discuss the implications of the above analysis for topological
constants. It will be shown that while cross helicity is not conserved for
non-barotropic MHD a variant of this quantity is. The implications of this to
non-barotropic MHD stability is discussed.

calculate the Hawking temperature of a black hole in a warped DGP gravity model

Klein-Gordon equations previously determined from the GUP Lagrangian in the
spacetime background of a warped Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) metric, with the
help of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and semiclassical (WKB) approximation methods. We
find that as a special case of a warped DGP black hole solution, the Hawking
temperature of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole can be determined.
Furthermore, the Hawking temperature is influenced by the mass and the angular
momentum of vector and scalar particles and depends on which of those types of
particles is being emitted by the black hole. We conclude that the nonthermal
nature of the Hawking spectrum leads to Planck-scale nonthermal correlations,
shedding light on the information paradox in black hole evaporation.

transformation up to the order of $1/c^4$ gives the intrinsic inertia of a pure
system through the 2$^{\rm nd}$ order time-derivative of magnetization in the
dynamical equation of motion. Thus, the inertial damping $\mathcal{I}$ is a
higher order spin-orbit coupling effect, $\sim 1/c^4$, as compared to the
Gilbert damping $\Gamma$ that is of order $1/c^2$. Inertia is therefore
expected to play a role only on ultrashort timescales (sub-picoseconds). We
