scale-q-derivative approach, we formulate differential equation that models the
cell death by a radiation exposure in tumor treatments. The considered
independent variable here is the absorbed radiation dose D instead of usual
time. The survival factor, Fs, for radiation damaged cell obtained here is in
agreement with the literature on the maximum entropy principle, as it was
recently shown and also exhibits an excellent agreement with the experimental

this approach, we give a step forward and suggest other expressions for
survival factors that are dependent on the complex tumor structure.

flares has been the topic of recent debate. In light of this, we have adapted a
method described by Vaughan (2005) to aid with the search for QPPs in flare
time series data. The method identifies statistically significant periodic
signals in power spectra, and properly accounts for red noise as well as the
uncertainties associated with the data. We show how the method can be further
developed to be used with rebinned power spectra, allowing us to detect QPPs
whose signal is spread over more than one frequency bin. An advantage of these
methods is that there is no need to detrend the data prior to creating the
power spectrum. Examples are given where the methods have been applied to
synthetic data, as well as real flare time series data with candidate QPPs from
the Nobeyama Radioheliograph. These show that, despite the transient nature of
QPPs, peaks corresponding to the QPPs can be seen at a significant level in the
power spectrum without any form of detrending or other processing of the
original time series data, providing the background trends are not too steep.

fixed time horizon. We assume that the signal is observed as a finite block of
noisy samples whereby we are interested in detecting changes from a given
reference signal. Our detector statistic is based on a sequential partial sum
process, related to classical signal decomposition and reconstruction
approaches applied to the sampled signal. We show that this detector process
converges weakly under the no change null hypothesis that the signal coincides
with the reference signal, provided that the spatial-temporal partial sum
process associated to the random field of the noise terms disturbing the
sampled signal con- verges to a Brownian motion. More generally, we also
establish the limiting distribution under a wide class of local alternatives

extensions to the case that the reference signal is unknown. We conclude with
an extensive simulation study of the detection algorithm.

an inverse annealing path from the prior to the posterior distribution. In many

particularly stems from the prior regime. When comparing complex models with
differences in a comparatively small number of parameters, intrinsic errors
from sampling fluctuations may outweigh the differences in the log marginal

integration scheme that directly targets the log Bayes factor. The method is
based on a modified annealing path between the posterior distributions of the

regime. We combine this scheme with the concept of non-equilibrium TI to
minimise discretisation errors from numerical integration. Results obtained on
Bayesian regression models applied to standard benchmark data, and a complex
hierarchical model applied to biopathway inference, demonstrate a significant
reduction in estimator variance over state-of-the-art TI methods.

YBaCuFeO$_{5}$, in its incommensurate phase, has of late, opened up a lively
debate. There are ambiguous reports on the nature of the spiral magnetic state.
Using first-principles DFT calculations for the parent compound within
LSDA+U+SO approximation, the multiferroic response and the nature of spiral
state is revealed. The helical spiral is found to be more stable below the
transition temperature as spins prefer to lie in ab plane. The
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the spin current mechanism were
earlier invoked to account for the electric polarisation in this system.
However, the DM interaction is found to be absent, spin current mechanism is
not valid in the helical spiral state and there is no electric polarisation
thereof. These results are in good agreement with the recent single-crystal
data. We also investigate the magnetic transitions in
YBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuFeO$_5$ for the entire range $0\le x\le 1$ of doping. The
exchange interactions are estimated as a function of doping and a quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) calculation on an effective spin Hamiltonian shows that the
paramagnetic to commensurate phase transition temperature increases with doping
till $x=0.5$ and decreases beyond. Our observations are consistent with
experimental findings.

multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and their shared environment. As a
result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a
complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that
predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of
cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic
equipment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both
the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the
presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the
question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to
forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy
as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability
of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, chlamydia, dengue,
gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, and whooping
cough--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time
series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to
prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks. We also
find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both
shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely
mechanisms for the observed differences across contagions. Our results
highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing
dynamic modeling approaches, and suggest challenges for performing model
selection across long time series. We further anticipate that our findings will
contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may
relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.

bulge above 25 keV from a simultaneous NuSTAR-Swift observation. We find that
this source is the counterpart to Swift J0042.6+4112, which was previously
detected in the Swift BAT All-sky Hard X-ray Survey. This Swift BAT source had
been suggested to be the combined emission from a number of point sources; our
new observations have identified a single X-ray source from 0.5 to 50 keV as
the counterpart for the first time. In the 0.5-10 keV band, the source had been
classified as an X-ray binary candidate in various Chandra and XMM studies;
however, since it was not clearly associated with Swift J0042.6+4112, the
previous E < 10 keV observations did not generate much attention. This source
has a spectrum with a soft X-ray excess (kT~ 0.2 keV) plus a hard spectrum with
a power law of Gamma ~ 1 and a cutoff around 15-20 keV, typical of the spectral
characteristics of accreting pulsars. Unfortunately, any potential pulsation
was undetected in the NuSTAR data, possibly due to insufficient photon
statistics. The existing deep HST images exclude high-mass (>3 Msun) donors at
the location of this source. The best interpretation for the nature of this
source is an X-ray pulsar with an intermediate-mass (<3 Msun) companion or a
symbiotic X-ray binary. We discuss other possibilities in more detail.

that the use of richer categories pays off, as these non-semisimple invariants

to recover the classification of lens spaces, which Reshetikhin-Turaev

The structure of the inner parts of Be star disks (20 stellar radii)
is well explained by the viscous decretion disk (VDD) model, which is able to
reproduce the observable properties of most of the objects studied so far. The
outer parts, on the ther hand, are not observationally well-explored, as they
are observable only at radio wavelengths. A steepening of the spectral slope
somewhere between infrared and radio wavelengths was reported for several Be
stars that were previously detected in the radio, but a convincing physical
explanation for this trend has not yet been provided. Aims. We test the VDD
model predictions for the extended parts of a sample of six Be disks that have
been observed in the radio to address the question of whether the observed
turndown in the spectral energy distribution (SED) can be explained in the
framework of the VDD model, including recent theoretical development for
truncated Be disks in binary systems. Methods. We combine new multi-wavelength
radio observations from the Karl. G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) with previously published radio data and archival
SED measurements at ultraviolet, visual, and infrared wavelengths. The density
structure of the disks, including their outer parts, is constrained by
radiative transfer modeling of the observed spectrum using VDD model
predictions. In the VDD model we include the presumed effects of possible tidal
influence from faint binary companions. Results. For 5 out of 6 studied stars,
the observed SED shows strong signs of SED turndown between far-IR and radio
wavelengths. A VDD model that extends to large distances closely reproduces the
observed SEDs up to far IR wavelengths, but fails to reproduce the radio SED.

a rung tensor product states representation and bosonization. Finally, we show
that doping with a few holes can result in the formation of hole pairs and

to reconstruct the distance-redshift relation in a model independent way. We
adopt simulated catalogues of standard sirens given by merging massive black
hole binaries (MBHBs) visible by LISA, with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart
detectable by future telescopes. The catalogues are constructed considering
three different astrophysical scenarios for the evolution of MBHB mergers based
on the semi-analytic model of E. Barausse (2012). We first use these standard
siren datasets to assess the potential of LISA in reconstructing a possible
interaction between vacuum dark energy and dark matter. Then we combine the
LISA cosmological data with supernovae data simulated for the Dark Energy
Survey (DES). We consider two scenarios distinguished by the time duration of
the LISA mission: 5 and 10 years. Using only LISA standard siren data, the dark
sector interaction can be well reconstructed from redshift $z\sim1$ to $z\sim3$
(5 yr) and $z\sim1$ up to $z\sim5$ (10 yr), though the reconstruction is
inefficient at lower redshift. When combined with the DES datasets, the
interaction is well reconstructed in the whole redshift region from $z\sim0$ to
$z\sim3$ (5 yr) and $z\sim0$ to $z\sim5$ (10 yr). MBHB standard sirens can thus
be used to constrain the dark sector interaction at redshift ranges not
reachable by usual supernovae datasets which probe only the $z\lesssim 1.5$
range. GW standard sirens will not only constitute a complementary and
alternative way, with respect to familiar EM observations, to probe the cosmic
expansion, but will also provide new tests to constrain possible deviations
from the standard $\Lambda$CDM dynamics, especially at high redshift.

isolation. This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a
significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots
should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and
instantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring
task-specific engineering. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework
for achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation learning.
  Specifically, we consider the setting where there is a very large set of
tasks, and each task has many instantiations. For example, a task could be to
stack all blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be to place
all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc. In each case, different
instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different
initial states. At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of
demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is trained that takes as
input one demonstration and the current state (which initially is the initial
state of the other demonstration of the pair), and outputs an action with the
goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions matches as closely as
possible with the second demonstration. At test time, a demonstration of a
single instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is expected to
perform well on new instances of this new task. The use of soft attention
allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training
data. We anticipate that by training this model on a much greater variety of
tasks and settings, we will obtain a general system that can turn any
demonstrations into robust policies that can accomplish an overwhelming variety
of tasks.

number of zero modes is bounded above by $2r$. In all cases the determinants
with excluded zero eigenvalues can be expressed only in terms of the $n$ zero

solutions of the homogeneous equation $O h=0$, in the spirit of Gel'fand-Yaglom

taken into account by introducing the so-called collective coordinates. We show
that there is a remarkable cancellation of a factor (involving scalar products

merging phase lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr, for $n=1\hbox{--}10$ cm$^{-3}$, and the
merging phase lasts for a longer time ($\sim 0.1$ Myr or more) for lower SN
rates ($\nu_{\rm sn}\le 10^{-10}$ pc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$). During this transition
phase, the growing superbubble is filled with dense and cool fragments of
shells and most of the energy is radiated away during this merging process.
After passing through the intermediate phase, the superbubble eventually
settles on to a new power-law wind asymptote that is smaller than estimated in
a continuous wind model. This results in a significant (more than {\it several
times}) underestimation of the mechanical luminosity needed to feed the bubble.
We determine the X-ray and H$\alpha$ surface brightnesses as functions of time
for such merging SNe in a stellar cluster and find that clusters with high SN
rate shine predominantly in soft X-rays and H$\alpha$. In particular, a low
value of the volume averaged H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ ratio and its large spread
can be a good indicator of the transition phase of merging SNe.

for landmark localization with a state-of-the-art residual block, train it on a
very large yet synthetically expanded 2D facial landmark dataset and finally
evaluate it on all other 2D facial landmark datasets. (b) We create a guided by

all existing datasets, leading to the creation of LS3D-W, the largest and most
challenging 3D facial landmark dataset to date ~230,000 images. (c) Following

stepping of the rods in an extended bottleneck region, located in between the
two entry sites, controls the extent of interference of the co-directional flow
of the two species of rods. The relative positions of the sites of entry of the
two species of rods with respect to the location of the bottleneck are
motivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study
here is to explore the effects of the interference of the flow of the two
species of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations of
this interference by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods
and their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the
system. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become
practically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental
physical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the
downstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated
by the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of
the results in the context of the biological phenomenon that motivated the

evidence of five different kinds of GRBs and that these groups have different

afford efficient implementations using a single primitive that is available in
a variety of backend engines: range scans over partitioned sorted maps.
  To evaluate these ideas, we implemented the Lara operators as range iterators
in Apache Accumulo, a popular implementation of Google's BigTable. First we
show how Lara expresses a sensor quality control task, and we measure the
performance impact of optimizations Lara admits on this task. Second we show
that the LaraDB implementation outperforms Accumulo's native MapReduce
integration on a core task involving join and aggregation in the form of matrix
multiply, especially at smaller scales that are typically a poor fit for
scale-out approaches. We find that LaraDB offers a conceptually lean framework

away from a resonance {\omega}o, repulsion between the photon-dressed (Floquet)
states can lead to a shift of energy resonance. The dominant effect is the
optical Stark shift (1/({\omega}0-{\omega})), but there is an additional
contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift (1/({\omega}o+{\omega})).
Although it is common in atoms and molecules, the observation of Bloch-Siegert
shift in solids has so far been limited only to artificial atoms since the
shifts were small (<1 {\mu}eV) and inseparable from the optical Stark shift.
Here we observe an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift (~10 meV) in
monolayer WS2 under infrared optical driving by virtue of the strong
light-matter interaction in this system. Moreover, we can disentangle the
Bloch-Siegert shift entirely from the optical Stark shift, because the two
effects are found to obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. By
controlling the light helicity, we can confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur
only at one valley, and the optical Stark shift at the other valley. Such a
valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the
valleytronic properties in two-dimensional materials, and offers a new avenue
to explore quantum optics in solids.

resources are regarded as a promising platform for CNN's implementation. At
massive parallelism of computational units, however, the external memory
bandwidth, which is constrained by the pin count of the VLSI chip, becomes the
system bottleneck. Moreover, VLSI solutions are usually regarded as a lack of
the flexibility to be reconfigured for the various parameters of CNNs. This
paper presents CNN-MERP to address these issues. CNN-MERP incorporates an
efficient memory hierarchy that significantly reduces the bandwidth
requirements from multiple optimizations including on/off-chip data allocation,
data flow optimization and data reuse. The proposed 2-level reconfigurability
is utilized to enable fast and efficient reconfiguration, which is based on the
control logic and the multiboot feature of FPGA. As a result, an external
memory bandwidth requirement of 1.94MB/GFlop is achieved, which is 55% lower
than prior arts. Under limited DRAM bandwidth, a system throughput of
1244GFlop/s is achieved at the Vertex UltraScale platform, which is 5.48 times

presence of random potential disorder. It is well known that charge and heat
spread via diffusion in such an interacting disordered metal. In contrast, we
show within perturbation theory that chaos spreads in a ballistic fashion. The
squared anticommutator of the electron field operators inherits a light-cone
like growth, arising from an interplay of a growth (Lyapunov) exponent that
scales as the inelastic electron scattering rate and a diffusive piece due to
the presence of disorder. In two spatial dimensions, the Lyapunov exponent is
universally related at weak coupling to the sheet resistivity. We are able to
define an effective temperature-dependent butterfly velocity, a speed limit for
the propagation of quantum information, that is much slower than microscopic
velocities such as the Fermi velocity and that is qualitatively similar to that
of a quantum critical system with a dynamical critical exponent $z > 1$.

model produces a $\sim$19% improvement over SExtractor. To avoid false
negatives in the PTF transient-candidate stream, we adopt a conservative
stellar classification threshold, corresponding to a galaxy misclassification

otherwise would have been missed. To leverage its superior image quality, we
additionally create an SDSS point-source catalog, which is also tuned to have a
galaxy misclassification rate = 0.005. These catalogs have been incorporated
into the PTF real-time pipelines to automatically reject stellar sources as
non-extragalactic transients.

interactions invariably occuring at high densities lead to a breakdown of the
assumption of independence between the particles, posing a severe challenge for
quantum sensors operating at the nanoscale. Here, we show that interactions in
quantum sensors can be transformed from a nuisance into an advantage when
strong interactions trigger a dissipative phase transition in an open quantum

based upon nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond. Using both a variational
method and numerical simulation of the master equation describing the open
quantum many-body system, we establish the existence of a dissipative first

properties of this phase transition for two- and three-dimensional setups,
demonstrating that the transition can be observed using current experimental

transitions are particularly robust against imperfections such as disorder or
decoherence, with the sensitivity of the sensor not being limited by the $T_2$

achievement of a quasi-stationary state, is driven by violent relaxation, with
a typical particle interacting with the time-changing collective potential. It
is traditionally assumed that this evolution is governed by the Vlasov-Poisson
equation, in which case entropy must be conserved. We run N-body simulations of
isolated self-gravitating systems, using three simulation codes: NBODY-6
(direct summation without softening), NBODY-2 (direct summation with softening)
and GADGET-2 (tree code with softening), for different numbers of particles and
initial conditions. At each snapshot, we estimate the Shannon entropy of the
distribution function with three different techniques: Kernel, Nearest Neighbor
and EnBiD. For all simulation codes and estimators, the entropy evolution
converges to the same limit as N increases. During violent relaxation, the
entropy has a fast increase followed by damping oscillations, indicating that
violent relaxation must be described by a kinetic equation other than the
Vlasov-Poisson, even for N as large as that of astronomical structures. This
indicates that violent relaxation cannot be described by a time-reversible
equation, shedding some light on the so-called ""fundamental paradox of stellar
dynamics"". The long-term evolution is well described by the orbit-averaged
Fokker-Planck model, with Coulomb logarithm values in the expected range 10-12.
By means of NBODY-2, we also study the dependence of the 2-body relaxation
time-scale on the softening length. The approach presented in the current work
can potentially provide a general method for testing any kinetic equation
intended to describe the macroscopic evolution of N-body systems.

of cores in the centre of galaxy clusters. Recent simulations predict that a
Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) inside a cored galaxy cluster will exhibit
residual wobbling due to previous major mergers, long after the relaxation of
the overall cluster. This phenomenon is absent with standard cold dark matter
where a cuspy density profile keeps a BCG tightly bound at the centre. We test
this hypothesis using cosmological simulations and deep observations of 10
galaxy clusters acting as strong gravitational lenses. Modelling the BCG wobble
as a simple harmonic oscillator, we measure the wobble amplitude, $A_w$, in the
BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, finding an upper
limit for the CDM paradigm of $A_w < 2$kpc at the 95% confidence limit. We
carry out the same test on the data finding a non-zero amplitude of
$A_w=11.82^{+7.3}_{-3.0}$kpc, with the observations dis-favouring $A_w = 0$ at
the 3$\sigma$ confidence level. This detection of BCG wobbling is evidence for
a dark matter core at the heart of galaxy clusters. It also shows that strong
lensing models of clusters cannot assume that the BCG is exactly coincident
with the large scale halo. While our small sample of galaxy clusters already
indicates a non-zero $A_w$, with larger surveys, e.g. Euclid, we will be able
to not only to confirm the effect but also to use it to determine whether or

identify the orbits primarily responsible for the BP/X shape. We estimate that
between 19-23\% of the mass of the bar is associated with the BP/X shape and
that most bar orbits contribute to this shape which is clearly seen in
projected surface density maps and 3D excess mass for non-resonant box orbits,
""banana"" orbits, ""fish/pretzel"" orbits and ""brezel"" orbits. {We find that
nearly all bar orbit families contribute some mass to the 3D BP/X-shape. All
co-added orbit families show a bifurcation in stellar number count distribution
with heliocentric distance that resembles the bifurcation observed in red clump
stars in the MW. However, only the box orbit family shows an increasing
separation of peaks with increasing galactic latitude $|b|$, similar to that
observed.} Our analysis shows that no single orbit family fully explains all
the observed features associated with the MW's BP/X shaped bulge, but
collectively the non-resonant boxes and various resonant boxlet orbits
contribute at different distances from the center to produce this feature. We
propose that since box orbits have three incommensurable orbital fundamental
frequencies, their 3-dimensional shapes are highly flexible and, like Lissajous
figures, this family of orbits is most easily able to adapt to evolution in the

ability to single out topological features of networks proceeding in a
bottom-up manner: first we consider small size networks by analytical methods

networks, the random graphs and the scale--free networks, are investigated
computing their Betti numbers and then showing the capability of geometric
entropy of detecting homologies.

a continuous relaxation of discrete variables to produce low-variance, but

a novel control variate that produces low-variance, \emph{unbiased} gradient

FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking for High Dimensional systems. A path or

captures all possible deviations due to high dimensional dynamics and external

directly relates to the accuracy of the predicted performance metrics and thus
the final design characteristics of the solar-powered UAV. Likewise, during the
operations phase of a solar-powered UAV accurate solar power income models are
required to predict and assess the solar power system performance. However, the
existing literature on solar-powered UAVs uses highly simplified solar power
models. This technical report therefore, first, introduces a high-fidelity
solar power model that takes into account the exact aircraft attitude, aircraft
geometry, and physical effects such as temperature and the sun radiation's
angle-of-incidence that influence the overall solar power system efficiency.
Second, models that require a reduced set of input data and are thus more
appropriate for the initial design phase of solar-powered UAVs are derived from
the high-fidelity model. Third, the models are compared and verified against
flight data from a 28-hour continuous day/night solar-powered flight. The
results indicate that our high-fidelity model allows a prediction of the

that in a certain regime of weak driving and weak nonlinearity such a turbulent

also various types of maps attached to data. In recent years, several related
structures have been used to study maps on data, including Reeb spaces, mappers
and multiscale mappers. The construction of these structures also relies on the
so-called \emph{nerve} of a cover of the domain.
  In this paper, we aim to analyze the topological information encoded in these
structures in order to provide better understanding of these structures and
facilitate their practical usage.
  More specifically, we show that the one-dimensional homology of the nerve
complex $N(\mathcal{U})$ of a path-connected cover $\mathcal{U}$ of a domain
$X$ cannot be richer than that of the domain $X$ itself. Intuitively, this
result means that no new $H_1$-homology class can be ""created"" under a natural
map from $X$ to the nerve complex $N(\mathcal{U})$. Equipping $X$ with a
pseudometric $d$, we further refine this result and characterize the classes of
$H_1(X)$ that may survive in the nerve complex using the notion of \emph{size}
of the covering elements in $\mathcal{U}$. These fundamental results about
nerve complexes then lead to an analysis of the $H_1$-homology of Reeb spaces,
mappers and multiscale mappers.
  The analysis of $H_1$-homology groups unfortunately does not extend to higher
dimensions. Nevertheless, by using a map-induced metric, establishing a
Gromov-Hausdorff convergence result between mappers and the domain, and
interleaving relevant modules, we can still analyze the persistent homology
groups of (multiscale) mappers to establish a connection to Reeb spaces.

characterize the hard X-ray spectrum during {\exo} outburst. METHODS - In this

X-ray transient {\exo} located in the globular cluster Terzan 5, performed ten
days after the beginning of the outburst (on 2015 March 16th) shown by the
source between March and June 2015. The source was caught in a hard state,
emitting a 0.8-100 keV luminosity of $\simeq10^{37}$~{\lumcgs}. RESULTS - The
spectral continuum was dominated by thermal Comptonization of seed photons with
temperature $kT_{in}\simeq1.3$ keV, by a cloud with moderate optical depth
$\tau\simeq2$ and electron temperature $kT_e\simeq 40$ keV. A weaker soft
thermal component at temperature $kT_{th}\simeq0.6$--0.7 keV and compatible
with a fraction of the neutron star radius was also detected. A rich emission
line spectrum was observed by the EPIC-pn on-board {\xmm}; features at energies
compatible with K-$\alpha$ transitions of ionized sulfur, argon, calcium and
iron were detected, with a broadness compatible with either thermal Compton
broadening or Doppler broadening in the inner parts of an accretion disk
truncated at $20\pm6$ gravitational radii from the neutron star. Strikingly, at
least one narrow emission line ascribed to neutral or mildly ionized iron is
needed to model the prominent emission complex detected between 5.5 and 7.5

unscalable with network size. Structural constraints can be imposed on the
design to counteract this problem albeit at the risk of making the solution
non-convex. In this paper, we present a special class of structural constraints
such that the H2 design satisfies a quadratic invariance condition, and
therefore can be reformulated as a convex problem. This special class consists
of structured and weighted projections of the input and output spaces. The
choice of these projections can be optimized to match the closed-loop
performance of the reformulated controller with that of the standard H2
controller. The advantage is that unlike the latter, the reformulated
controller results in a hierarchical implementation which requires
significantly lesser number of communication links, while also admitting model
and controller reduction that helps the design to scale computationally. We
illustrate our design with simulations of a 500-node network.

Decades of research with stochastic search techniques has shown the benefit of
explicitly modeling the interactions between sets of parameters and the overall
quality of the solutions discovered. We demonstrate a novel method, based on
learning deep networks, to model the global landscapes of optimization
problems. To represent the search space concisely and accurately, the deep
networks must encode information about the underlying parameter interactions
and their contributions to the quality of the solution. Once the networks are
trained, the networks are probed to reveal parameter combinations with high
expected performance with respect to the optimization task. These estimates are
used to initialize fast, randomized, local search algorithms, which in turn
expose more information about the search space that is subsequently used to
refine the models. We demonstrate the technique on multiple optimization
problems that have arisen in a variety of real-world domains, including:
packing, graphics, job scheduling, layout and compression. The problems include
combinatoric search spaces, discontinuous and highly non-linear spaces, and
span binary, higher-cardinality discrete, as well as continuous parameters.
Strengths, limitations, and extensions of the approach are extensively
discussed and demonstrated.

  with camera-traps at the spots of attraction","4 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Camera-traps is a relatively new but already popular instrument in the
estimation of abundance of non-identifiable animals. Although camera-traps are
convenient in application, there remain both theoretical complications such as
spatial autocorrelation or false negative problem and practical difficulties,
for example, laborious random sampling. In the article we propose an
alternative way to bypass the mentioned problems.
  In the proposed approach, the raw video information collected from the
camera-traps situated at the spots of natural attraction is turned into the
frequency of visits, and the latter is transformed into the desired abundance
estimate. The key for such a transformation is the application of the
correction coefficients, computed for each particular observation environment
using the Bayesian approach and the massive database (DB) of observations under
various conditions.
  The main result of the article is a new method of census based on video-data
from camera-traps at the spots of natural attraction and information from a
special community-driven database.
  The proposed method is based on automated video-capturing at a moderate
number of easy to reach spots, so in the long term many laborious census works
may be conducted easier, cheaper and cause less disturbance for the wild life.
Information post-processing is strictly formalized, which leaves little chance
for subjective alterations. However, the method heavily relies on the volume
and quality of the DB, which in its turn heavily relies on the efforts of the
community. There is realistic hope that the community of zoologists and
environment specialists could create and maintain a DB similar to the proposed
one. Such a rich DB of visits might benefit not only censuses, but also many
behavioral studies.

algorithm was designed for analysis of discontinuous or shearing types of
motion, i.e. segmentation of broken tag patterns.
  Materials and methods The proposed algorithm utilizes non-linear scale space
for automatic segmentation of single-shot tagged images. The algorithm's
ability to automatically segment tagged shearing motion was evaluated in a
numerical simulation and in vivo. A typical shearing deformation was simulated
in a Shepp-Logan phantom allowing for quantitative evaluation of the
algorithm's success rate as a function of both SNR and the amount of
deformation. For a qualitative in vivo evaluation tagged images showing
deformations in the calf muscles and eye movement in a healthy volunteer were
acquired.
  Results Both the numerical simulation and the in vivo tagged data
demonstrated the algorithm's ability for automated segmentation of single-shot
tagged MR provided that SNR of the images is above 10 and the amount of
deformation does not exceed the tag spacing. The latter constraint can be met
by adjusting the tag delay or the tag spacing.
  Conclusion The scale space based algorithm for automatic segmentation of
single-shot tagged MR enables the application of tagged MR to complex
(shearing) deformation and the processing of datasets with relatively low SNR.

at low Reynolds regimes where transitions take place through spatio-temporal

critical Reynolds number associated with symmetry breaking, and the associated
eigenmodes, known as global modes. The analysis shows that the axisymmetric
stable base flow breaks the rotational symmetry through a pitchfork $m=1$
bifurcation, in agreement with previously reported results for axisymmetric
wakes. Above this threshold, the stable base flow is steady and
three-dimensional with planar symmetry. A three-dimensional global stability
analysis around the steady reflectionally symmetric base flow, assuming no
homogeneous directions, predicts accurately the Hopf bifurcation threshold,
which leads to asymmetric vortex shedding. DNS simulations validate the
stability results and characterize the flow topology during the early chaotic

While there are good algorithms for solving packing and covering linear
programs in a distributed manner (Kuhn et al.~2006), this is essentially the
only class of linear programs for which such an algorithm is known. In this
work we provide a distributed algorithm for solving a different class of convex
programs which we call ""distance-bounded network design convex programs"". These
can be thought of as relaxations of network design problems in which the
connectivity requirement includes a distance constraint (most notably, graph
spanners). Our algorithm runs in $O( (D/\epsilon) \log n)$ rounds in the
$\mathcal{LOCAL}$ model and finds a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal
LP solution for any $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$, where $D$ is the largest distance
constraint. While solving linear programs in a distributed setting is
interesting in its own right, this class of convex programs is particularly
important because solving them is often a crucial step when designing
approximation algorithms. Hence we almost immediately obtain new and improved
distributed approximation algorithms for a variety of network design problems,
including Basic $3$- and $4$-Spanner, Directed $k$-Spanner, Lowest Degree
$k$-Spanner, and Shallow-Light Steiner Network Design with a spanning demand
graph. Our algorithms do not require any ""heavy"" computation and essentially
match the best-known centralized approximation algorithms, while previous
approaches which do not use heavy computation give approximations which are
worse than the best-known centralized bounds.

an Internet of Things (IoT) system, composed of a heterogeneous group of nodes
compromising both machine-type devices (MTDs) and human-type devices (HTDs).
The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game between the heterogeneous
IoT devices that seek to find the optimal time allocation so as to meet their
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in terms of energy, rate and latency.
Since the strategy space of each device is dependent on the actions of the
other devices, the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution is first
characterized, and the conditions for uniqueness of the GNE are derived. Then,
to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of the devices, in terms of resource
constraints and QoS needs, a novel and more realistic game-theoretic approach,
based on the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy (CH) theory, is
proposed. This approach is then shown to enable the IoT devices to reach a CH
equilibrium (CHE) concept that takes into account the various levels of
rationality corresponding to the heterogeneous computational capabilities and
the information accessible for each one of the MTDs and HTDs. Simulation
results show that the proposed CHE solution keeps the percentage of devices
with satisfied QoS constraints above 96% for IoT networks containing up to
10,000 devices without considerably degrading the overall system performance.

Softening-induced deformation of flat polymeric monoliths upon contact
formation in the presence of liquids enhanced the work of separation WSe. On
flat TiO2-coated monoliths, WSe was under wet conditions smaller than under dry
conditions, possibly because of liquid-induced screening of solid-solid
interactions. Under dry conditions, WSe is larger on flat TiO2-coated monoliths
than on flat monoliths with polymeric surface. However, under wet conditions
liquid-induced softening results in larger WSe on flat monoliths with polymeric
surface than on flat monoliths with oxidic surface. Monolithic microsphere
arrays show anti-adhesive properties; FAd and WSe are reduced by at least one
order of magnitude as compared to flat nanoporous counterparts. On nanoporous
monolithic microsphere arrays, capillarity (WSe is larger under wet than under
dry conditions) and solid-solid interactions (WSe is larger on oxide than on

the impact of softening-induced surface deformation and screening of

labeled training data for learning algorithms. Standard approaches to
crowdsourcing view the process of acquiring labeled data separately from the
process of learning a classifier from the gathered data. This can give rise to
computational and statistical challenges. For example, in most cases there are
no known computationally efficient learning algorithms that are robust to the
high level of noise that exists in crowdsourced data, and efforts to eliminate
noise through voting often require a large number of queries per example.
  In this paper, we show how by interleaving the process of labeling and
learning, we can attain computational efficiency with much less overhead in the
labeling cost. In particular, we consider the realizable setting where there
exists a true target function in $\mathcal{F}$ and consider a pool of labelers.
When a noticeable fraction of the labelers are perfect, and the rest behave
arbitrarily, we show that any $\mathcal{F}$ that can be efficiently learned in
the traditional realizable PAC model can be learned in a computationally
efficient manner by querying the crowd, despite high amounts of noise in the
responses. Moreover, we show that this can be done while each labeler only
labels a constant number of examples and the number of labels requested per
example, on average, is a constant. When no perfect labelers exist, a related
task is to find a set of the labelers which are good but not perfect. We show
that we can identify all good labelers, when at least the majority of labelers
are good.

propagates parallel to the interferometer plane at $45^{\circ }$ angle relative

number of feedbacks with randomly varied time delays induced by a fiber random

Intrigued experiment, the first from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory
(iPTF) to search for transients simultaneously in the $g_\mathrm{PTF}$- and
$R_\mathrm{PTF}$-bands. During the course of this experiment we discovered
iPTF$\,$16fnm, a new member of the 02cx-like subclass of type Ia supernovae
(SNe). iPTF$\,$16fnm peaked at $M_{g_\mathrm{PTF}} = -15.09 \pm 0.17 \;
\mathrm{mag}$, making it the second least-luminous known type Ia SN. iPTF 16fnm
exhibits all the hallmarks of the 02cx-like class: (i) low luminosity at peak,
(ii) low ejecta velocities, and (iii) a non-nebular spectra several months
after peak. Spectroscopically, iPTF$\,$16fnm exhibits a striking resemblence to
2 other low-luminosity 02cx-like SNe: SNe 2007qd and 2010ae. iPTF$\,$16fnm and
SN 2005hk decline at nearly the same rate, despite a 3 mag difference in
brightness at peak. When considering the full subclass of 02cx-like SNe, we do
not find evidence for a tight correlation between peak luminosity and decline
rate in either the $g'$ or $r'$ band. We further examine the $g' - r'$
evolution of 02cx-like SNe and find that their unique color evolution can be
used to separate them from 91bg-like and normal type Ia SNe. This selection
function will be especially important in the spectroscopically incomplete
Zwicky Transient Facility/Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era. We measure the
relative rate of 02cx-like SNe to normal SNe Ia and find $r_{N_{02cx}/N_{Ia}} =
25^{+75}_{-18.5}\%$. Finally, we close by recommending that LSST periodically
evaluate, and possibly update, its observing cadence to maximize transient
science.

prominence planar thread filled with partially ionised plasma in the
incompressible limit. The importance of partial ionisation is investigated in
terms of the ionisation factor and wavelength of waves propagating in the slab.
To highlight the role of partial ionisation, we have constructed models
describing various situations we can meet in solar prominence fine structure.
Matching the solutions for the transversal component of the velocity and total
pressure at the interfaces between the prominence slab and surrounding plasmas,
we derived a dispersion relation whose imaginary part describes the evolution
of the instability. Results are obtained in the limit of weak dissipation. We
have investigated the appearance of instabilities in prominence dark plumes
using single and two-fluid approximations. We show that dissipative
instabilities appear for flow speeds that are less than the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability threshold. The onset of instability is determined by the
equilibrium flow strength, the ionisation factor of the plasma, the wavelength
of waves and the ion-neutral collisional rate. For a given wavelength and for
ionisation degrees closer to a neutral gas, the propagating waves become
unstable for a narrow band of flow speeds, meaning that neutrals have a
stabilising effect. Our results show that the partially ionised plasma
describing prominence dark plumes becomes unstable only in a two-fluid (charged
particles-neutrals) model, that is for periods that are smaller than the
ion-neutral collision time. The present study improves our understanding of
stability of solar prominences and the role of partial ionisation in
destabilising the plasma. We show the necessity of two-fluid approximation when
discussing the nature of instabilities: waves in a single fluid approximation
show a great deal of stability.

species interdependence. We report a large scale study of microbial diversity

number of genomes studied as a simple power law. This result is demonstrated
for three different genera comparing over 15,000 isolates. We show that this
power law is formally related to the MacArthur-Wilson exponent, suggesting the
emerging diversity of microbial genotypes arises because the scale independent
behavior first reported by MacArthur and Wilson extends down to the scale of
microbes and their genes. Assessing the depth of available whole genome
sequences implies a dynamically changing core genome, suggesting that
traditional taxonomic classifications should be replaced with a quasispecies

form, $L$, on a graded algebra has maximal rank (in every degree). We consider
a quotient by an ideal that is generated by powers of linear forms. Then the
Lefschetz question is, for example, related to the problem whether a set of fat
points imposes the expected number of conditions on a linear system of
hypersurfaces of fixed degree. Our starting point is a result that relates
Lefschetz properties in different rings. It suggests to use induction on the
number of variables, $n$. If $n = 3$, then it is known that multiplication by
$L$ always has maximal rank. We show that the same is true for multiplication
by $L^2$ if all linear forms are general. Furthermore, we give a complete
description of when multiplication by $L^3$ has maximal rank (and its failure
when it does not). As a consequence, for such ideals that contain a quadratic
or cubic generator, we establish results on the so-called Strong Lefschetz
Property for ideals in $n=3$ variables, and the Weak Lefschetz Property for
ideals in $n=4$ variables.

an ordinal relationship -- an anchor point $x$ is similar to a set of positive
points $Y$, and dissimilar to a set of negative points $Z$, and a loss defined
over these distances is minimized. While the specifics of the optimization
differ, in this work we collectively call this type of supervision Triplets and
all methods that follow this pattern Triplet-Based methods. These methods are
challenging to optimize. A main issue is the need for finding informative
triplets, which is usually achieved by a variety of tricks such as increasing
the batch size, hard or semi-hard triplet mining, etc. Even with these tricks,
the convergence rate of such methods is slow. In this paper we propose to
optimize the triplet loss on a different space of triplets, consisting of an
anchor data point and similar and dissimilar proxy points which are learned as
well. These proxies approximate the original data points, so that a triplet
loss over the proxies is a tight upper bound of the original loss. This
proxy-based loss is empirically better behaved. As a result, the proxy-loss
improves on state-of-art results for three standard zero-shot learning
datasets, by up to 15% points, while converging three times as fast as other
triplet-based losses.

ensemble of trigonally distorted octahedral crystal fields accounts for the

program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using
a latent program representation.
  Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a

program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program
generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of
variable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92%
accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous
best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a
comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate
that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric
and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models
to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g.,
typos), while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely.

combination of the R{\o}mer delay and a non-zero eccentricity. Then, the binary

individuals' data in the dataset are correlated, and that there are many cases

weaknesses, we traced the origin of differential privacy to Dalenius' goal, a
more rigorous privacy measure. We formalized Dalenius' goal by using Shannon's
perfect secrecy and tried to achieve Dalenius' goal with better utility. Our
first result is that, if the independence assumption is true, then differential
privacy is equivalent to Dalenius' goal, where the independence assumption
assumes that each adversary has no knowledge of the correlation among different
individuals' data in the dataset. This implies that the security of
differential privacy is based on the independence assumption. Since the
independence assumption is impractical, we introduced a new practical
assumption, which assumes that each adversary is unknown to some data of the
dataset if the dataset is large enough. Based on the assumption, we can achieve
Dalenius' goal with better utility. Furthermore, we proved a useful result
which can transplant results or approaches of information theory into data
privacy protection. We then proved that several basic privacy
mechanisms/channels satisfy Dalenuis' goal, such as the random response, the
exponential, and the Gaussian privacy channels, which are respective
counterparts of the random response, the exponential, and the Gaussian
mechanisms of differential privacy. Moreover, the group and the composition

the manually transcribed speech required to develop standard ASR systems can be

unsupervised solutions to obtaining tokenizations of speech in terms of a
vocabulary of automatically discovered word-like or phoneme-like units, without

massive quasars at z~6. Previous studies of such stars were either unable to
resolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the
extreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not
self-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the
resulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to
simple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution
and collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates
of 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our
approach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an
adaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic
evolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic
instability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at
masses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar
masses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly
logarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its
stability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and
the heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes
suggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary
state of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since
the general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these
stars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at
birth.

globules in a modest extensional flow are investigated in this paper. Through
this work, a shift of the globule, which is driven mainly by the asymmetric
interfacial curvature, not by the outer drag, is disclosed. The asymmetric
layout of the daughter droplet leads to the asymmetric drags from the
continuous phase and the asymmetric deformation of the globule with different
interface curvatures. As the inner droplet has both enhancing and suppressing
effect on the globule deformation, the interface curvatures will vary when
changing the relative size and location of the inner droplet. This curvature
difference results in the asymmetric pressure distribution and circulation
inside the globule. Eventually, the interaction of the inner driving force
(pressure differences) and the outer drags causes the oriented shift and
inverse of the globule. The shift direction is affected not only by the
structural asymmetry parameter (eccentricity), but also by some flow features
such as the capillary number. The results obtained here might enlighten
potential applications for the movement of soft globules driven by curvature
differences.

Motivated by the tremendous potential of OAM in communication systems, we
propose a novel method to generate vortex beams by spoof surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs). A looped double-layer spoof SPP waveguide is applied to
realize the transmission of electromagnetic waves. Beam emitting is
accomplished through a series of circular patches, whose role is not only the
radiation units but also resonators giving rise to the phase shifts required by
the vortex beam. The proposed method is validated by both numerical calculation
and experiment. The measured results show that the spoof SPPs are radiated by
the circular patches and the vortex beam carrying different OAM modes are
observed at different frequencies. This is the first time to generate the OAM
modes by spoof SPPs. The proposed method possesses smaller size and is much
easier to be integrated into integrated circuits. The simple structure and
design procedure make the proposed method promising in future wireless
communication systems.

system, which may be hard to verify for nonlinear systems, while guaranteeing
asymptotic convergence of errors, which may be insufficient in order to satisfy
performance conditions in finite time. This paper develops a method to design
Luenberger-type observers for nonlinear systems which guarantee the largest
possible domain of attraction for the state estimation error regardless of the
initialization of the system. The observer design procedure is posed as a two
step problem. In the the first step, the error dynamics are abstractly
represented as a linear equation on the space of Radon measures. Thereafter,
the problem of identifying the largest set of initial errors that can be driven
to within the user-specified error target set in finite-time for all possible
initial states, and the corresponding observer gains, is formulated as an
infinite-dimensional linear program on measures. This optimization problem is
solved, using Lasserre's relaxations via a sequence of semidefinite programs
with vanishing conservatism. By post-processing the solution of step one, the
set of gains that maximize the size of tolerable initial errors is identified
in step two. To demonstrate the feasibility of the presented approach two
examples are presented.

grown exponentially in recent years. Given the critical role of ICs in the
control and operation of vehicular systems and other modern engineering
designs, such offshore outsourcing has led to serious security threats due to
the potential of insertion of hardware trojans - malicious designs that, when
activated, can lead to highly detrimental consequences. In this paper, a novel
game-theoretic framework is proposed to analyze the interactions between a
hardware manufacturer, acting as attacker, and an IC testing facility, acting
as defender. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game in which the
attacker must decide on the type of trojan that it inserts while taking into
account the detection penalty as well as the damage caused by the trojan.
Meanwhile, the resource-constrained defender must decide on the best testing
strategy that allows optimizing its overall utility which accounts for both
damages and the fines. The proposed game is based on the robust behavioral
framework of prospect theory (PT) which allows capturing the potential
uncertainty, risk, and irrational behavior in the decision making of both the
attacker and defender. For both, the standard rational expected utility (EUT)
case and the PT case, a novel algorithm based on fictitious play is proposed
and shown to converge to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For an illustrative
case study, thorough analytical results are derived for both EUT and PT to
study the properties of the reached equilibrium as well as the impact of key
system parameters such as the defender-set fine. Simulation results assess the
performance of the proposed framework under both EUT and PT and show that the
use of PT will provide invaluable insights on the outcomes of the proposed
hardware trojan game, in particular, and system security, in general.

higher MW sample (5.5K), whereas little alignment is discernible for the lower

strength and cooling rate suggests that different average grain sizes are
produced during slow cooling of these materials, with larger grains formed in
the higher MW material. Blending the block copolymers results in homogeneous
samples which display $\mathrm{T_{odt}}$, d-spacings and grain sizes that are
intermediate between the two neat diblocks. Similarly, the alignment quality
displays a smooth variation with the concentration of the higher MW diblock in
the blends and the size of grains likewise interpolates between limits set by
the neat diblocks, with a factor of 3.5X difference in the grain size observed

utilize antiferromagnets as core elements in spintronic devices. A central
motivation toward this direction is that antiferromagnetic spin dynamics is
expected to be much faster than ferromagnetic counterpart because
antiferromagnets have higher resonance frequencies than ferromagnets. Recent
theories indeed predicted faster dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls
(DWs) than ferromagnetic DWs. However, experimental investigations of
antiferromagnetic spin dynamics have remained unexplored mainly because of the
immunity of antiferromagnets to magnetic fields. Furthermore, this immunity
makes field-driven antiferromagnetic DW motion impossible despite rich physics
of field-driven DW dynamics as proven in ferromagnetic DW studies. Here we show
that fast field-driven antiferromagnetic spin dynamics is realized in
ferrimagnets at the angular momentum compensation point TA. Using rare-earth
3d-transition metal ferrimagnetic compounds where net magnetic moment is
nonzero at TA, the field-driven DW mobility remarkably enhances up to 20 km/sT.
The collective coordinate approach generalized for ferrimagnets and atomistic
spin model simulations show that this remarkable enhancement is a consequence
of antiferromagnetic spin dynamics at TA. Our finding allows us to investigate
the physics of antiferromagnetic spin dynamics and highlights the importance of
tuning of the angular momentum compensation point of ferrimagnets, which could
be a key towards ferrimagnetic spintronics.

some emerging organically from grassroots activity, others sustained by
advertising or other coordinated efforts. These campaigns contribute to the
shaping of collective opinions. While most information campaigns are benign,
some may be deployed for nefarious purposes. It is therefore important to be
able to detect whether a meme is being artificially promoted at the very moment
it becomes wildly popular. This problem has important social implications and
poses numerous technical challenges. As a first step, here we focus on
discriminating between trending memes that are either organic or promoted by
means of advertisement. The classification is not trivial: ads cause bursts of
attention that can be easily mistaken for those of organic trends. We designed
a machine learning framework to classify memes that have been labeled as
trending on Twitter.After trending, we can rely on a large volume of activity
data. Early detection, occurring immediately at trending time, is a more
challenging problem due to the minimal volume of activity data that is
available prior to trending.Our supervised learning framework exploits hundreds
of time-varying features to capture changing network and diffusion patterns,
content and sentiment information, timing signals, and user meta-data. We
explore different methods for encoding feature time series. Using millions of
tweets containing trending hashtags, we achieve 75% AUC score for early
detection, increasing to above 95% after trending. We evaluate the robustness
of the algorithms by introducing random temporal shifts on the trend time
series. Feature selection analysis reveals that content cues provide
consistently useful signals; user features are more informative for early
detection, while network and timing features are more helpful once more data is
available.

more challenging than text classification. On one hand, labeled text data is
more widely available than the labeled images for classification tasks. On the
other hand, text data tends to have natural semantic interpretability, and they
are often more directly related to class labels. On the contrary, the image
features are not directly related to concepts inherent in class labels. One of
our goals in this paper is to develop a model for revealing the functional
relationships between text and image features as to directly transfer
intermodal and intramodal labels to annotate the images. This is implemented by
learning a transfer function as a bridge to propagate the labels between two
multimodal spaces. However, the intermodal label transfers could be undermined
by blindly transferring the labels of noisy texts to annotate images. To
mitigate this problem, we present an intramodal label transfer process, which
complements the intermodal label transfer by transferring the image labels
instead when relevant text is absent from the source corpus. In addition, we
generalize the inter-modal label transfer to zero-shot learning scenario where
there are only text examples available to label unseen classes of images
without any positive image examples. We evaluate our algorithm on an image
classification task and show the effectiveness with respect to the other

application areas, and models explaining and predicting choices made by
individuals are in high demand. Discrete choice models are widely studied in
economics and computational social sciences. As digital social networking
facilitates information flow and spread of influence between individuals, new
advances in modeling are needed to incorporate social information into these
models in addition to characteristic features affecting individual choices. In
this paper, we propose two novel models with scalable training algorithms:
local logistics graph regularization (LLGR) and latent class graph
regularization (LCGR) models. We add social regularization to represent
similarity between friends, and we introduce latent classes to account for
possible preference discrepancies between different social groups. Training of
the LLGR model is performed using alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM), and training of the LCGR model is performed using a specialized Monte
Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Scalability to large graphs is
achieved by parallelizing computation in both the expectation and the
maximization steps. The LCGR model is the first latent class classification
model that incorporates social relationships among individuals represented by a
given graph. To evaluate our two models, we consider three classes of data to
illustrate a typical large-scale use case in internet and social media
applications. We experiment on synthetic datasets to empirically explain when
the proposed model is better than vanilla classification models that do not
exploit graph structure. We also experiment on real-world data, including both
small scale and large scale real-world datasets, to demonstrate on which types
of datasets our model can be expected to outperform state-of-the-art models.

d$T_c$/d$B_\phi$ $\sim$ -0.29KT$^{-1}$, which is much larger than those
observed in iron pnictides. This unexpected large suppression of $T_c$ in FeSe
is discussed in relation to the large diameter of the columnar defects as well

current density is first dramatically enhanced with irradiation reaching a
value over $\sim$2$\times$10$^5$ A/cm$^2$ ($\sim$5 times larger than that of

associated with spatial fluctuations of the transition temperature are found to
coexist in the pristine FeSe, while the irradiation increases the contribution

question is whether the transformation from measurements to line integrals is
invertible. This paper presents a proof that for a system with two spectra and
a photon counting detector, pileup does not affect the invertibility of the

with pileup although the reduced Jacobian may lead to increased noise.

The observation of >100 MeV {\gamma}-rays in the minutes to hours
following solar flares suggests that high-energy particles interacting in the
solar atmosphere can be stored and/or accelerated for long time periods. The
occasions when {\gamma}-rays are detected even when the solar eruptions
occurred beyond the solar limb as viewed from Earth provide favorable viewing
conditions for studying the role of coronal shocks driven by coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) in the acceleration of these particles.
  Aims: In this paper, we investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of the
coronal shocks inferred from stereoscopic observations of behind-the-limb
flares to determine if they could be the source of the particles producing the
{\gamma}-rays.
  Methods: We analyzed the CMEs and early formation of coronal shocks
associated with {\gamma}-ray events measured by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope
(LAT) from three eruptions behind the solar limb as viewed from Earth on 2013
Oct. 11, 2014 Jan. 06 and Sep. 01. We used a 3D triangulation technique, based
on remote-sensing observations to model the expansion of the CME shocks from
above the solar surface to the upper corona. Coupling the expansion model to
various models of the coronal magnetic field allowed us to derive the
time-dependent distribution of shock Mach numbers and the magnetic connection
of particles produced by the shock to the solar surface visible from Earth.
  Results: The reconstructed shock fronts for the three events became
magnetically connected to the visible solar surface after the start of the
flare and just before the onset of the >100 MeV {\gamma}-ray emission. The
shock surface at these connections also exhibited supercritical Mach numbers
required for significant particle energization.

quadrature surfaces (potential theoretic concept) and sandpile dynamics
(Laplacian growth models). For this aim, we introduce a new model of Laplacian
growth on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ $(d\geq 2)$ which continuously deforms
occupied regions of the \emph{divisible sandpile} model of Levine and Peres, by
redistributing the total mass of the system onto $\frac 1m$-sub-level sets of
the odometer which is a function counting total emissions of mass from lattice
vertices. In free boundary terminology this goes in parallel with singular
perturbation, which is known to converge to a Bernoulli type free boundary.
  We prove that models, generated from a single source, have a scaling limit,
if the threshold $m$ is fixed. Moreover, this limit is a ball, and the entire
mass of the system is being redistributed onto an annular ring of thickness
$\frac 1m$. By compactness argument we show that, when $m$ tends to infinity
sufficiently slowly with respect to the scale of the model, then in this case
also there is scaling limit which is a ball, with the mass of the system being
uniformly distributed onto the boundary of that ball, and hence we recover a
quadrature surface in this case.
  Depending on the speed of decay of $m$, the visited set of the sandpile
interpolates between spherical and polygonal shapes. Finding a precise
characterisation of this shape-transition phenomenon seems to be a considerable
challenge, which we cannot address at this moment.

carrier dynamics (transport, recombination, and collection) and simulate
practical-efficiency of solar cells (SCs) through taking into account various
carrier recombination losses existing in multilayered device structures.
Exploring the way to predict and approach the SC efficiency limit by using the
drift-diffusion model will enable us to gain more physical insights and design
guidelines for emerging photovoltaics, particularly perovskite solar cells. Our
work finds out that two procedures are the prerequisites for predicting and
approaching the SC efficiency limit. Firstly, the intrinsic radiative
recombination needs to be corrected after adopting optical designs which will
significantly affect the open-circuit voltage at its Shockley-Queisser limit.
Through considering a detailed balance between emission and absorption of
semiconductor materials at the thermal equilibrium, and the Boltzmann
statistics at the non-equilibrium, we offer a different approach to derive the
accurate expression of intrinsic radiative recombination with the optical
corrections for semiconductor materials. The new expression captures light

expression. Secondly, the contact characteristics of the electrodes need to be
carefully engineered to eliminate the charge accumulation and surface
recombination at the electrodes. The selective contact or blocking layer
incorporated nonselective contact that inhibits the surface recombination at
the electrode is another important prerequisite. With the two procedures, the
accurate prediction of efficiency limit and precise evaluation of efficiency
degradation for perovskite solar cells are attainable by the drift-diffusion

into two independent stages: first, compute region proposals from the image
without the exploration of the language description; second, score the object
proposals with regard to the referring expression and choose the top-ranked
proposals. The object proposals are generated independently from the referring
expression, which makes the proposal generation redundant and even irrelevant
to the referred object. In this work, we train an agent with deep reinforcement
learning, which learns to move and reshape a bounding box to localize the
object according to the referring expression. We incorporate both the spatial
and temporal context information into the training procedure. By simultaneously
exploiting local visual information, the spatial and temporal context and the
referring language a priori, the agent selects an appropriate action to take at
each time. A special action is defined to indicate when the agent finds the
referred object, and terminate the procedure. We evaluate our model on various

systematically removed from the description of the dynamics, resulting in a
considerable model simplification and gain of computational time. Nowadays, the
gyrokinetic (GK) codes play a major role in the understanding of the
development and the saturation of turbulence and in the prediction of the
subsequent transport. Naturally, these codes require thorough verification and
validation.
  Here we present a new and generic theoretical framework and specific
numerical applications to test the faithfulness of the implemented models to
theory and to verify the domain of applicability of existing GK codes. For a
sound verification process, the underlying theoretical GK model and the
numerical scheme must be considered at the same time, which has rarely been
done and therefore makes this approach pioneering. At the analytical level, the
main novelty consists in using advanced mathematical tools such as variational
formulation of dynamics for systematization of basic GK code's equations to
access the limits of their applicability. The verification of numerical scheme
is proposed via the benchmark effort.
  In this work, specific examples of code verification are presented for two GK
codes: the multi-species electromagnetic ORB5 (PIC) and the radially global
version of GENE (Eulerian). The proposed methodology can be applied to any
existing GK code. We establish a hierarchy of reduced GK Vlasov-Maxwell
equations implemented in the ORB5 and GENE codes using the Lagrangian
variational formulation. At the computational level, detailed verifications of
global electromagnetic test cases developed from the CYCLONE Base Case are
considered, including a parametric $\beta$-scan covering the transition from
ITG to KBM and the spectral properties at the nominal $\beta$ value.

dynamical stability of MoN-TaN solid solutions together with cubic-like MoN/TaN
superlattices, as another materials design concept. Hexagonal-type structures
based on low-energy modifications of MoN and TaN are the most stable ones over
the whole composition range. Despite being metastable, disordered cubic
polymorphs are energetically significantly preferred over their ordered
counterparts. An in-depth analysis of atomic environments in terms of bond
lengths and angles reveals that the chemical disorder results in (partially)
broken symmetry, i.e., the disordered cubic structure relaxes towards a
hexagonal NiAs-type phase, the ground state of MoN. Surprisingly, also the
superlattice architecture is clearly favored over the ordered cubic solid
solution. We show that the bi-axial coherency stresses in superlattices break
the cubic symmetry beyond simple tetragonal distortions and lead to a new
tetragonal $\zeta$-phase (space group P4/nmm), which exhibits a more negative
formation energy than the symmetry-stabilized cubic structures of MoN and TaN.
Unlike cubic TaN, the $\zeta\text{-TaN}$ is elastically and vibrationally
stable, while $\zeta$-MoN is stabilized only by the superlattice structure. To
map compositional trends in elasticity, we establish mechanical stability of
various Mo$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$N systems and find the closest high-symmetry
approximants of the corresponding elastic tensors. According to the estimated
polycrystalline moduli, the hexagonal polymorphs are predicted to be extremely
hard, however, less ductile than the cubic phases and superlattices. The trends
in stability based on energetics and elasticity are corroborated by density of
electronic states.

of our mathematical model, shown for a wide range of parameters, can be related
to the BR homeostasis. Our results for the crosstalk model suggest that the

on the dynamics of the signalling pathways than BZR-mediated biosynthesis of
GA, suggesting that the interaction between transcription factors may
constitute the principal mechanism of the crosstalk between the BR and GA

have larger effects on the dynamics of components of the BR signalling pathway
than perturbations in the BR signalling pathway on the dynamics of the GA

ionized and neutral species in exoplanet atmospheres by comparing the observed
stellar lines in and out of transit. The centre-to-limb variation (CLV) of the
stellar lines across the stellar disk is an important effect for transmission
spectroscopy, since it results in a change of stellar line depth when the
planet transits different parts of the stellar disk. We reanalyse the transit
data of HD 189733b taken with the HARPS spectrograph to study the CLV effect
during transit. The transmission light curve of the Na i D line so obtained
shows a clear imprint of the CLV effect. We use a one-dimensional non-LTE
stellar spectral model to simulate the CLV effect. After applying the
correction, the measurement of the Na i absorption in the atmosphere of HD
189733b becomes better determined. We compare the CLV effect of HD 189733b to
that of HD 209458b. The CLV effects are different for these two benchmark
planetary systems and this is attributed to their different stellar effective
temperatures and transit impact parameters. We then explore the general CLV
effect that occurs during exoplanet transits. Normally, a star with a lower
effective temperature exhibits a stronger CLV effect and its CLV feature
extends over a relatively broad wavelength range. The transit impact parameter
(b) describes the transit trajectory on the stellar disk and thus determines
the actual manifestation of the CLV effect. We introduce a b-diagram which
describes the behavior of the CLV effect as the function of different impact
parameters. With improving observational precision, a careful modeling and
correction of the CLV effect is necessary for exoplanet atmosphere
characterisation using transit spectroscopy.

only by a low-rank modification of the previous one, and exploiting this

underlying features remain poorly understood. Although fine-grained
distinctions within a race might more strongly constrain possible facial
features used by humans than in case of coarse categories such as race or
gender, such fine grained distinctions are relatively less studied.
Fine-grained race classification is also interesting because even humans may
not be perfectly accurate on these tasks. This allows us to compare errors made
by humans and machines, in contrast to standard object detection tasks where
human performance is nearly perfect. We have developed a novel face database of
close to 1650 diverse Indian faces labeled for fine-grained race (South vs
North India) as well as for age, weight, height and gender. We then asked close
to 130 human subjects who were instructed to categorize each face as belonging
toa Northern or Southern state in India. We then compared human performance on
this task with that of computational models trained on the ground-truth labels.
Our main results are as follows: (1) Humans are highly consistent (average
accuracy: 63.6%), with some faces being consistently classified with > 90%
accuracy and others consistently misclassified with < 30% accuracy; (2) Models
trained on ground-truth labels showed slightly worse performance (average
accuracy: 62%) but showed higher accuracy (72.2%) on faces classified with >
80% accuracy by humans. This was true for models trained on simple spatial and
intensity measurements extracted from faces as well as deep neural networks
trained on race or gender classification; (3) Using overcomplete banks of
features derived from each face part, we found that mouth shape was the single

the resulting distance between distributions, are useful tools for fully
nonparametric two-sample testing and learning on distributions. However, it is
rarely that all possible differences between samples are of interest --
discovered differences can be due to different types of measurement noise, data
collection artefacts or other irrelevant sources of variability. We propose
distances between distributions which encode invariance to additive symmetric
noise, aimed at testing whether the assumed true underlying processes differ.
Moreover, we construct invariant features of distributions, leading to learning
algorithms robust to the impairment of the input distributions with symmetric
additive noise.

Since the existence of an attractor is a transversal property of the foliation,
it is natural to consider foliations admitting transversal geometric
structures. As transversal structures are chosen Cartan geometries due to their
universality. The existence problem of an attractor on a complete Cartan
foliation is reduced to a similar problem for the action of its structure Lie
group on a certain smooth manifold. In the case of a complete Cartan foliation
with a structure subordinated to a transformation group, the problem is reduced
to the level of the global holonomy group of this foliation. Each countable
automorphism group preserving a Cartan geometry on a manifold and admitting an
attractor is realized as the global holonomy group of some Cartan foliation
with an attractor. Conditions on the linear holonomy group of a leaf of a
reductive Cartan foliation sufficient for the existence of an attractor (and a
global attractor) which is a minimal set are found. Various examples are
considered.

polarizations have been detected in few of the brightest objects. Even though
future polarimeters using X-ray telescopes are expected to observe weak
persistent sources, there are no effective approaches to survey transient and
serendipitous sources with a wide field of view (FoV). Here we present an
electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) as a highly-sensitive gamma-ray imaging
polarimeter. The ETCC provides powerful background rejection and a high
modulation factor over a FoV of up to 2$\pi$ sr thanks to its excellent imaging
based on a well-defined point spread function. Importantly, we demonstrated for
the first time the stability of the modulation factor under realistic
conditions of off-axis incidence and huge backgrounds using the SPring-8
polarized X-ray beam. The measured modulation factor of the ETCC was 0.65 $\pm$
0.01 at 150 keV for an off-axis incidence with an oblique angle of 30$^\circ$
and was not degraded compared to the 0.58 $\pm$ 0.02 at 130 keV for on-axis
incidence. These measured results are consistent with the simulation results.
Consequently, we found that the satellite-ETCC proposed in Tanimori et al.

on a nominal scale, often with a large number of categories. The definition of
categories is usually not unambiguous and different classification schemes
using either a finer or a coarser grid are possible. Categorisation has an
impact when such a variable is included as covariate in a regression model: a
too fine grid will result in imprecise estimates of the corresponding effects,
whereas with a too coarse grid important effects will be missed, resulting in
biased effect estimates and poor predictive performance.
  To achieve automatic grouping of levels with essentially the same effect, we
adopt a Bayesian approach and specify the prior on the level effects as a
location mixture of spiky normal components. Fusion of level effects is induced
by a prior on the mixture weights which encourages empty components.
Model-based clustering of the effects during MCMC sampling allows to
simultaneously detect categories which have essentially the same effect size

dielectric ellipsoidal particles embedded in lossy media. The new expression
leads directly to a closed form solution for the optimal conjugate match with
respect to the surrounding medium, i.e., the optimal permittivity of the
ellipsoidal particle that maximizes the absorption at any given frequency. This
defines the optimal plasmonic resonance for the ellipsoid. The optimal
conjugate match represents a metamaterial in the sense that the corresponding
optimal permittivity function may have negative real part (inductive
properties), and can not in general be implemented as a passive material over a
given bandwidth. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the
feasibility of tuning the Drude model to the optimal conjugate match at a
single frequency, and it is found that all the prolate spheroids and some of
the (not too flat) oblate spheroids can be tuned into optimal plasmonic
resonance at any desired center frequency. Numerical examples are given to
illustrate the analysis. Except for the general understanding of plasmonic
resonances in lossy media, it is also anticipated that the new results can be

define classes of galaxies in a three-dimensional space spanned by the $\log$

parameters. The best-fit GMM based on several statistical criteria suggests a
solution around four Gaussian components (GCs), which are capable to explain up
to 97 per cent of the data variance. Using elements of information theory, we
compare each GC to their respective astronomical counterpart. GC1 and GC4 are
associated with star-forming galaxies, suggesting the need to define a new
starburst subgroup. GC2 is associated with BPT's Active Galaxy Nuclei (AGN)
class and WHAN's weak AGN class. GC3 is associated with BPT's composite class

forces, does not transport dynein, which displays the same binding/unbinding

applications. To produce high quality join results, a stream processing system
must deal with the ubiquitous disorder within input streams which is caused by
network delay, asynchronous source clocks, etc. Disorder handling involves an
inevitable tradeoff between the latency and the quality of produced join
results. To meet different requirements of stream applications, it is desirable
to provide a user-configurable result-latency vs. result-quality tradeoff.
Existing disorder handling approaches either do not provide such
configurability, or support only user-specified latency constraints.
  In this work, we advocate the idea of quality-driven disorder handling, and
propose a buffer-based disorder handling approach for sliding window joins,
which minimizes sizes of input-sorting buffers, thus the result latency, while
respecting user-specified result-quality requirements. The core of our approach
is an analytical model which directly captures the relationship between sizes
of input buffers and the produced result quality. Our approach is generic. It
supports m-way sliding window joins with arbitrary join conditions. Experiments
on real-world and synthetic datasets show that, compared to the state of the
art, our approach can reduce the result latency incurred by disorder handling
by up to 95% while providing the same level of result quality.

dimension one fermionic field, sometimes called Elko. The numerical analysis of
the coupled system of equations furnish a scale factor growth and energy
density evolution that correctly reproduces the inflationary phase of the
universe. After that, supposing a mechanism of energy transference to ordinary
matter, the initial conditions generated after inflation drives the radiation
dominated phase and also the subsequent dark matter evolution, since the Elko
field is a good dark matter candidate. The energy density of the field at the
end of inflation, at the end of radiation phase and for present time are in
agreement to the standard model estimates. The analysis was performed with a
potential containing a quadratic mass term plus a quartic self-interaction
term, which follows naturally from the theory of mass dimension one fermions.
It is interesting to notice that inflation occurs when the field makes a kind
of transition around the Planck mass scale. The number of e-foldings during
inflation was found to be strongly dependent on the initial conditions of the
Elko field, as occurs in chaotic inflationary models. An upper mass limit for
Elko field has been obtained as $m<10^9$GeV. A possible interpretation of both

sectors, and the effect of preheating and related processes on their energy
densities during the evolution of the universe. Over most of parameter space,
preheating is not disrupted by the presence of extra sectors, and even
comparatively weakly coupled sectors can get an order 1 fraction of the total
energy at this time. If two sectors are both preheated, the high number
densities could also lead to inflaton mediated thermalisation. If only one
sector is preheated, Bose enhancement of the late time inflaton decays may
cause significant deviations from the perturbative prediction for their
relative reheat temperatures. Meanwhile, in Non-Oscillatory inflation models
resonant effects can result in exponentially large final temperature
differences between sectors that have similar couplings to the inflaton.
Asymmetric reheating is potentially relevant for a range of beyond the Standard
Model physics scenarios. We show that in dark matter freeze-in models, hidden
sector temperatures a factor of 10 below that of the visible sector are
typically needed for the relic abundance to be set solely by freeze-in
dynamics.

inspired from computer vision and machine learning to search for words in large
collections of digitized manuscripts. In particular, we are interested in
historical handwritten texts, which are often far more challenging than modern

quickly find what they are looking for in large collections that are tedious
and difficult to read manually. To this end, we introduce an end-to-end
trainable model based on deep neural networks that we call Ctrl-F-Net. Given a
full manuscript page, the model simultaneously generates region proposals, and
embeds these into a distributed word embedding space, where searches are
performed. We evaluate the model on common benchmarks for handwritten word
spotting, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art segmentation-free
approaches by a large margin, and in some cases even segmentation-based
approaches. One interesting real-life application of our approach is to help
historians to find and count specific words in court records that are related
to women's sustenance activities and division of labor. We provide promising
preliminary experiments that validate our method on this task.

be reduced considerably through proactively fetching the content that is most
probable to be requested. In this paper, we aim at exploring the impact of
proactive caching on an important metric for future generation networks,
namely, energy efficiency (EE). We argue that, exploiting the correlation in
user content popularity profiles in addition to the spatial repartitions of
users with comparable request patterns, can result in considerably improving
the achievable energy efficiency of the network. In this paper, the problem of
optimizing EE is decoupled into two related subproblems. The first one
addresses the issue of content popularity modeling. While most existing works
assume similar popularity profiles for all users in the network, we consider an
alternative caching framework in which, users are clustered according to their
content popularity profiles. In order to showcase the utility of the proposed
clustering scheme, we use a statistical model selection criterion, namely
Akaike information criterion (AIC). Using stochastic geometry, we derive a
closed-form expression of the achievable EE and we find the optimal active
small cell density vector that maximizes it. The second subproblem investigates
the impact of exploiting the spatial repartitions of users with comparable
request patterns. After considering a snapshot of the network, we formulate a
combinatorial optimization problem that enables to optimize content placement
such that the used transmission power is minimized. Numerical results show that
the clustering scheme enable to considerably improve the cache hit probability
and consequently the EE compared with an unclustered approach. Simulations also
show that the small base station allocation algorithm results in improving the
energy efficiency and hit probability.

in the protic ionic liquid ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) confined between
parallel polar glass plates separated by a few um as a function of time after
placement in a magnetic field of 9.40 T. Immediately after sample placement,
the diffusion coefficient of EA (D) increased by a factor of 2, while the
transverse NMR relaxation of NH3 protons decreased by factors of up to 22 in
comparison with bulk EAN, according to previously published data. Further
exposure to the magnetic field leads to gradual changes of D, T1 and T2 with a
time constant of 70 min and a total equilibration time of longer than 4 hours.
This process does not depend on the orientation of the glass plates relative to
the magnetic field. Removing the sample from the magnetic field and repeating
the experiment demonstrated that complete recovery of the sample to the
accelerated D and shortened T2 occurs in approximately 24 hours. Thus, EA
cation dynamics is accelerated relative to bulk when the cation is confined
between polar glass plates and stored in the absence of a strong magnetic
field, but demonstrate a trend to change to bulk values of D and T2 after
exposure to a magnetic field. Because the observed characteristic times of the
change far exceed molecular process times in EAN, we relate this phenomenon to
reversible phase transformations occurring with EAN between polar plates
outside the strong magnetic field, and reverse change of the phases after
placing the sample in the magnetic field. This conclusion was confirmed by data
of Raman spectroscopy.

over the wavelength range 3000-25000 \AA\ of 101 nearby M dwarfs (dMs),
observed with the Very Large Telescope X-Shooter spectrograph. For each star we
search for a hot component superimposed on the dM spectrum. X-Shooter has
excellent blue sensitivity and thus can reveal a faint hot WD despite the
brightness of its red companion. Visual examination shows no clear evidence of
a WD in any of the spectra. We place upper limits on the effective temperatures
of WDs that may still be hiding by fitting dM templates to the spectra, and
modeling WD spectra. On average our survey is sensitive to WDs hotter than
about 5300 K. This suggests that the frequency of WD companions of T<5300 K

observing the TeV detected nucleus of the active galaxy IC 310, whose jet is

campaign was conducted between 2012 Nov. and 2013 Jan., and involved
observations with MAGIC, Fermi, INTEGRAL, Swift, OVRO, MOJAVE and EVN. These
observations were complemented with archival data from the AllWISE and 2MASS
catalogs. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was applied to describe the
broad-band spectral energy distribution. IC 310 showed an extraordinary TeV
flare at the beginning of the campaign, followed by a low, but still detectable
TeV flux. Compared to previous measurements, the spectral shape was found to be
steeper during the low emission state. Simultaneous observations in the soft
X-ray band showed an enhanced energy flux state and a harder-when-brighter
spectral shape behaviour. No strong correlated flux variability was found in
other frequency regimes. The broad-band spectral energy distribution obtained
from these observations supports the hypothesis of a double-hump structure. The
harder-when-brighter trend in the X-ray and VHE emission is consistent with the
behaviour expected from a synchrotron self-Compton scenario. The
contemporaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution is well described with
a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model using parameters that are comparable
to those found for other gamma-ray-emitting misaligned blazars.

fine tuning that are becoming increasingly problematic with the lack of new
physics observations at the LHC. We develop a new fine tuning measure that
accurately counts each contribution to fine tuning (single, double, triple,
etc) that can occur in a theory with $n_p$ parameters, that must reproduce
$n_o$ observables. We then use a novel scanning procedure to perform a
comprehensive study of three different two-site, 4D, $SO(5)\rightarrow SO(4)$
MCHMs with all third generation fermions included, distinguished by the choice
of the lepton embeddings. These are the
MCHM$^{\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\textbf{5-5-5}}$,

MCHM$^{\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\textbf{14-1-10}}$, where MCHM$^{q-t-b}_{l-\tau-\nu}$
has the lepton doublet partner in representation $l$, tau partner in
representation $\tau$, and so on. We find that embedding at least one massive
lepton in the symmetric $\textbf{14}$ of $SO(5)$ reduces the tuning for the
case of low top partner masses (in line with previous results), but that this
is balanced against the increased complexity of the model when one properly
accounts for all sources of fine tuning. We study both the current relative
fine-tuning of each scenario, and the future prospects. Noting that the
different scenarios behave differently with respect to future improvements in
collider measurements, we find that the
MCHM$^{\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\textbf{14-1-10}}$ enjoys a relatively low increase in
fine tuning even for a future lower bound on the top partner masses of 3.4 TeV
(or equivalently a maximum Higgs-fermion or Higgs-gluon coupling deviation of
2%).

""contextual"", characterized by large scale integration spanning distant
cortical regions, and implemented by slower frequency (theta-alpha)

transactions, where synchronization of beta-gamma oscillations between distant
cortical regions is mediated by widespread theta-alpha oscillations. It is the
aim of this paper to express this hypothesis quantitatively, in terms of a
model that will allow testing this type of information transaction mechanism.
The basic methodology used here corresponds to statistical mediation analysis,
originally developed by (Baron and Kenny 1986). We generalize the classical
mediator model to the case of multivariate complex-valued data, consisting of
the discrete Fourier transform coefficients of signals of electric neuronal
activity, at different frequencies, and at different cortical locations. The
""mediation effect"" is quantified here in a novel way, as the product of ""dual

allows an organism to perceive, model and make decisions from disparate streams
of information and adapt to changing environments. Against this backdrop, we
present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism ASP (Adaptive Synaptic
Plasticity) for improved recognition with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for
real time on-line learning in a dynamic environment. We incorporate an adaptive
weight decay mechanism with the traditional Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity
(STDP) learning to model adaptivity in SNNs. The leak rate of the synaptic
weights is modulated based on the temporal correlation between the spiking
patterns of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This mechanism helps in gradual
forgetting of insignificant data while retaining significant, yet old,
information. ASP, thus, maintains a balance between forgetting and immediate
learning to construct a stable-plastic self-adaptive SNN for continuously
changing inputs. We demonstrate that the proposed learning methodology
addresses catastrophic forgetting while yielding significantly improved
accuracy over the conventional STDP learning method for digit recognition

grow with time: people make new friendships, new papers are published and refer
to the existing ones, and so forth. To assess the statistical significance of
measurements made on such networks, we propose a randomization methodology---a
time-respecting null model---that preserves both the network's degree sequence
and the time evolution of individual nodes' degree values. By preserving the
temporal linking patterns of the analyzed system, the proposed model is able to
factor out the effect of the system's temporal patterns on its structure. We
apply the model to the citation network of Physical Review scholarly papers and
the citation network of US movies. The model reveals that the two datasets are
strikingly different with respect to their degree-degree correlations, and we
discuss the important implications of this finding on the information provided
by paradigmatic node centrality metrics such as indegree and Google's PageRank.
The randomization methodology proposed here can be used to assess the
significance of any structural property in growing networks, which could bring
new insights into the problems where null models play a critical role, such as
the detection of communities and network motifs.

for covariant split equations. The introduction of additional differential
forms (DF) that form pairs with the original ones permits the splitting of the
equations into topological momentum and continuity equations and
metric-dependent closure equations that apply the Hodge-star operator. Our
discretization framework conserves this geometrical structure and provides for
all DFs proper FE spaces such that the differential operators hold in strong
form. We introduce lowest possible order discretizations of the split 1D wave
equations, in which the discrete momentum and continuity equations follow by
trivial projections onto piecewise constant FE spaces, omitting partial
integrations. Approximating the Hodge-star by nontrivial Galerkin projections
(GP), the two discrete metric equations follow by projections onto either the
piecewise constant (GP0) or piecewise linear (GP1) space.
  Our framework gives us three schemes with significantly different behavior.
The split scheme using twice GP1 is unstable and shares the dispersion relation
with the P1-P1 FE scheme that approximates both variables by piecewise linear
spaces (P1). The split schemes that apply a mixture of GP1 and GP0 share the
dispersion relation with the stable P1-P0 FE scheme that applies piecewise
linear and piecewise constant (P0) spaces. However, the split schemes exhibit
second order convergence for both quantities of interest. For the split scheme
applying twice GP0, we are not aware of a corresponding standard formulation to
compare with. Though it does not provide a satisfactory approximation of the
dispersion relation as short waves are propagated much too fast, the discovery
of the new scheme illustrates the potential of our discretization framework as
a toolbox to study and find FE schemes by new combinations of FE spaces.

everyone should learn and can therefore include in their skill set. Seymour
Papert is credited as concretising Computational Thinking in 1980 but since
Wing popularised the term in 2006 and brought it to the international
community's attention, more and more research has been conducted on CT in
education. The aim of this systematic literary review is to give educators and
education researchers an overview of what work has been carried out in the
domain, as well as potential gaps and opportunities that still exist.
  Overall it was found in this review that, although there is a lot of work
currently being done around the world in many different educational contexts,
the work relating to CT is still in its infancy. Along with the need to create
an agreed-upon definition of CT lots of countries are still in the process of,
or have not yet started, introducing CT into curriculums in all levels of
education. It was also found that Computer Science/Computing, which could be
the most obvious place to teach CT, has yet to become a mainstream subject in
some countries, although this is improving. Of encouragement to educators is
the wealth of tools and resources being developed to help teach CT as well as
more and more work relating to curriculum development. For those teachers
looking to incorporate CT into their schools or classes then there are
bountiful options which include programming, hands-on exercises and more. The
need for more detailed lesson plans and curriculum structure however, is
something that could be of benefit to teachers.

planets called Centaurs, which may be intermediate between Kuiper Belt Objects
and Jupiter Family comets. It is sporadically active throughout its orbit at
distances too far for water ice to sublimate, the source of activity for most
comets. Thus, its coma must be triggered by another mechanism. In 2005,
Echeclus had a strong outburst with peculiar behavior that raised questions
about the nucleus homogeneity. In order to test nucleus models, we performed
the most sensitive search to date for the highly volatile CO molecule via its
J=2-1 emission toward Echeclus during 2016 May-June (at 6.1 astronomical units
from the Sun) using the Arizona Radio Observatory 10-m Submillimeter Telescope.
We obtained a 3.6-sigma detection with a slightly blue-shifted (delta v = -0.55
+- 0.1 km/s) and narrow (FWHM = 0.53 +- 0.23 km/s) line. The data are
consistent with emission from a cold gas from the sunward side of the nucleus,
as seen in two other comets at 6 AU. We derive a production rate of Q(CO) =
(7.7 +- 3.3)x10^26 mol/s, which is capable of driving the estimated dust
production rates. Echeclus CO outgassing rate is ~40 times lower than what is
typically seen for another Centaur at this distance, 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann
1. We also used the IRAM 30-m telescope to search for the CO J=2-1 line, and
derive an upper limit that is above the SMT detection. Compared to the
relatively unprocessed comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), Echeclus produces
significantly less CO, as do Chiron and four other Centaurs.

Painlev\'e \cite{Painleve1895, Painleve1905a,Painleve1905b} showed that the
governing rigid body equations for this problem can exhibit multiple solutions
(the {\it indeterminate} case) or no solutions at all (the {\it inconsistent}
case), provided the coefficient of friction $\mu$ exceeds a certain critical
value $\mu_P$. Subsequently G\'enot and Brogliato \cite{GenotBrogliato1999}
proved that, from a consistent state, the rod cannot reach an inconsistent
state through slipping. Instead there is a special solution for
$\mu>\mu_C>\mu_P$, with $\mu_C$ a new critical value of the coefficient of
friction, where the rod continues to slip until it reaches a singular `$0/0$'
point $P$. Even though the rigid body equations can not describe what happens
to the rod beyond the singular point $P$, it is possible to extend the special
solution into the region of indeterminacy. This extended solution is very
reminiscent of a {\it canard} \cite{Benoit81}. To overcome the inadequacy of
the rigid body equations beyond $P$, the rigid body assumption is relaxed in
the neighbourhood of the point of contact of the rod with the rough surface.
Physically this corresponds to assuming a small compliance there. It is natural
to ask what happens to both the point $P$ and the special solution under this
regularization, in the limit of vanishing compliance. In this paper, we prove
the existence of a canard orbit in a reduced $4D$ slow-fast phase space,
connecting a $2D$ focus-type slow manifold with the stable manifold of a $2D$
saddle-type slow manifold. The proof combines several methods from local
dynamical system theory, including blowup. The analysis is not standard, since
we only gain ellipticity rather than hyperbolicity with our initial blowup.

measuring the endpoint region of the tritium $\beta$ spectrum. As a large-scale
experiment with a sharp energy resolution, high source luminosity and low
background it may also be capable of testing certain theories of neutrino
interactions beyond the standard model (SM). An example of a non-SM interaction
are right-handed currents mediated by right-handed W bosons in the left-right
symmetric model (LRSM). In this extension of the SM, an additional
SU(2)$_\mathrm R$ symmetry in the high-energy limit is introduced, which
naturally includes sterile neutrinos and predicts the seesaw mechanism. In
tritium $\beta$ decay, this leads to an additional term from interference
between left- and right-handed interactions, which enhances or suppresses
certain regions near the endpoint of the beta spectrum. In this work, the
sensitivity of KATRIN to right-handed currents is estimated for the scenario of
a light sterile neutrino with a mass of some eV. This has been performed with a
Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The simulations show
that in principle KATRIN is able to set sterile neutrino mass-dependent limits
on the interference strength. Thereby, the sensitivity is significantly
increased if the $Q$ value of the $\beta$ decay can be sufficiently
constrained. However, the sensitivity is not high enough to improve current
upper limits from right-handed W boson searches at the LHC.

Mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars are a class of slowly rotating
chemically peculiar main-sequence late B-type stars. More than two-thirds of
the HgMn stars are known to belong to spectroscopic binaries.
  Aims. By determining orbital solutions for binary HgMn stars, we will be able
to obtain the masses for both components and the distance to the system.
Consequently, we can establish the position of both components in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and confront the chemical peculiarities of the HgMn
stars with their age and evolutionary history.
  Methods. We initiated a program to identify interferometric binaries in a
sample of HgMn stars, using the PIONIER near-infrared interferometer at the
VLTI on Cerro Paranal, Chile. For the detected systems, we intend to obtain
full orbital solutions in conjunction with spectroscopic data.
  Results. The data obtained for the SB2 system 41 Eridani allowed the
determination of the orbital elements with a period of just five days and a
semi-major axis of under 2 mas. Including published radial velocity
measurements, we derived almost identical masses of 3.17 +/- 0.07 M_Sun for the
primary and 3.07 +/- 0.07 M_Sun for the secondary. The measured magnitude
difference is less than 0.1 mag. The orbital parallax is 18.05 +/- 0.17 mas,
which is in good agreement with the Hipparcos trigonometric parallax of 18.33
+/- 0.15 mas. The stellar diameters are resolved as well at 0.39 +/- 0.03 mas.
The spin rate is synchronized with the orbital rate.

  der Waals tunnel junctions",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Device-based tunnel spectroscopy of superconductors was first performed by
Giaever, whose seminal work provided clear evidence for the spectral gap in the
density of states (DOS) predicted by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
theory. Since then, tunnel-barrier-based heterostructure devices have revealed
myriad physical phenomena and found a range of applications. Most of these
devices rely on a limited number of oxides, which form high-quality insulating,
non-magnetic barriers. These barriers, however, do not grow well on all
surfaces. Promising alternatives are van der Waals (vdW) materials, ultrathin
layers of which can be precisely positioned on many surfaces; they have been
shown to form tunnel barriers when engaged with graphene. Here we demonstrate
that vdW semiconductors MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ deposited on the superconductor
NbSe$_2$ form high quality tunnel barriers, with transparencies in the
$10^{-8}$ range. Our measurements of the NbSe$_2$ DOS at 70mK show a hard
superconducting gap, and a quasiparticle peak structure with clear evidence of
contributions from two bands, with intrinsic superconductivity in both bands.
In both perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields, we observe a sub-gap DOS
associated with vortex bound states. The linear dependence of the zero-bias
signal on perpendicular field allows us to confirm the s-wave nature of
superconductivity in NbSe$_2$. As vdW tunnel barriers can be deployed on many
solid surfaces, they extend the range of superconducting and other materials
addressable not only by high resolution tunneling spectroscopy but also
non-equilibrium and/or non-local transport.

develop an autoregressive convolutional neural network that learns to

those of a baseline based on warping semantic segmentations using optical flow.

mechanism, which are ubiquitously generated in itinerant electron systems with
local magnetic moments. Carefully examining the higher-order perturbations in
terms of the spin-charge coupling, we construct a minimal effective spin model

numbers dictated by the Fermi surface. We find that our effective model
captures the underlying physics of the instability toward noncoplanar
multiple-$Q$ states discovered recently in itinerant magnets: a single-$Q$
helical state expected from the RKKY theory is replaced by a double-$Q$ vortex
crystal with chirality density waves even for an infinitely small spin-charge
coupling on generic lattices [R. Ozawa $\mathit{et \ al.}$, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn.

Lett. (arXiv: 1703.03227)]. We find that, by introducing an external magnetic

of Sobolev gradients to derive a new conjugate gradient method for direct
minimization of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional with rotation. The
conservation of the number of particles constrains the minimizers to lie on a
manifold corresponding to the unit $L^2$ norm. The idea developed here is to
transform the original constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained
problem on this (spherical) Riemannian manifold, so that fast minimization
algorithms can be applied as alternatives to more standard constrained
formulations. First, we obtain Sobolev gradients using an equivalent definition
of an $H^1$ inner product which takes into account rotation. Then, the
Riemannian gradient (RG) steepest descent method is derived based on projected
gradients and retraction of an intermediate solution back to the constraint
manifold. Finally, we use the concept of the Riemannian vector transport to
propose a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for this problem. It is
derived at the continuous level based on the ""optimize-then-discretize""
paradigm instead of the usual ""discretize-then-optimize"" approach, as this
ensures robustness of the method when adaptive mesh refinement is performed in
computations. We evaluate various design choices inherent in the formulation of
the method and conclude with recommendations concerning selection of the best
options. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed RCG method outperforms
the simple gradient descent (RG) method in terms of rate of convergence. While
on simple problems a Newton-type method implemented in the {\tt Ipopt} library
exhibits a faster convergence than the (RCG) approach, the two methods perform
similarly on more complex problems requiring the use of mesh adaptation. At the
same time the (RCG) approach has far fewer tunable parameters.

model. In this paper, LC of electron plasma waves is investigated using fully
nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations of collisionless bounded plasma. It is
shown that, in agreement with the basic theory, plasmons survive substantial
transformations of the spectrum and are destroyed only when their wave numbers
become large enough to trigger Landau damping. Since nonlinear effects decrease
the damping rate, LC is even more efficient when practiced on structures like
quasiperiodic Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) waves rather than on Langmuir

which can be seen as an multiplayer variant of the ""classic"" two-player Cops

player, who has no preference over which cop captures the robber. In SCAR, on
the other hand, each of N-1 cops is controlled by a separate player, and a
single robber is controlled by the N-th player; and the capturing cop player
receives a higher reward than the non-capturing ones. Consequently, SCAR is an
N-player pursuit game on graphs, in which each cop player has an increased
motive to be the one who captures the robber. The focus of our study is the
existence and properties of SCAR Nash Equilibria (NE). In particular, we prove
that SCAR always has one NE in deterministic positional strategies and (for N
greater than two) another in deterministic nonpositional strategies.
Furthermore, we study conditions which, at equilibrium, guarantee either
capture or escape of the robber and show that (because of the antagonism
between the ""selfish"" cop players) the robber may, in certain SCAR
configurations, be captured later than he would be in classic CR, or even not

Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods applied to systems of (non-necessarily Hamiltonian)
ordinary differential equations by means of Newton-like iterations. We pay
particular attention to symmetric symplectic IRK schemes (such as collocation
methods with Gaussian nodes). For a $s$-stage IRK scheme used to integrate a
$d$-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the application of
simplified versions of Newton iterations requires solving at each step several
linear systems (one per iteration) with the same $sd \times sd$ real
coefficient matrix. We propose rewriting such $sd$-dimensional linear systems
as an equivalent $(s+1)d$-dimensional systems that can be solved by performing
the LU decompositions of $[s/2] +1$ real matrices of size $d \times d$. We
present a C implementation (based on Newton-like iterations) of Runge-Kutta
collocation methods with Gaussian nodes that make use of such a rewriting of
the linear system and that takes special care in reducing the effect of
round-off errors. We report some numerical experiments that demonstrate the
reduced round-off error propagation of our implementation.

assuming that the entries of the tensor are sampled independently with

with high probability. Moreover, we also provide the deterministic and

steering in gradients of sensory cues, sperm adjust the flagellar beat
waveform. Symmetric and asymmetric beat waveforms produce straight and curved
swimming paths, respectively. Two different mechanisms controlling the
flagellar beat have been proposed: average intrinsic curvature and dynamic
buckling instability. Both mechanisms create spatially asymmetric waveforms
that could be modulated for steering. Using video microscopy, we image the
flagellar waveform of human sperm tethered with the head to a glass surface.
The waveform is characterized by a fundamental beat frequency and its second
harmonic. We show that superposition of first and second harmonics breaks the
beat symmetry temporally rather than spatially. As a result, sperm rotate
around the tethering point. The rotation velocity is determined by the
amplitude and phase of the second harmonic. Sperm stimulation with the female
sex hormone progesterone enhances the second-harmonic contribution, modulates
the flagellar beat, and ultimately sperm rotation. The temporal breaking of
beat symmetry represents a new mechanism of sperm steering. Higher-frequency
components were also reported for the flagellar beat of other cells; therefore,
this steering mechanism might by quite general and could inspire the design of
synthetic microswimmers.

agent can deliberately take actions, offer an opportunity to tackle this task
better, because the agent can experiment with different actions and observe
their effects. We introduce the idea that in interactive environments, latent

numerically the scaling properties of the heavy-tailed random fluctuations by

an inclined thin plate and a three-plate configuration known as the Kasper Wing
in the presence of an oncoming uniform flow. The flow is assumed to be
potential and is modeled by the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Actuation
has the form of blowing and suction localized on the main plate and is
represented in terms of a sink-source singularity, whereas measurement of
pressure across the plate serves as system output. We focus on point-vortex
equilibria forming a one-parameter family with locus approaching the trailing
edge of the main plate and show that these equilibria are either unstable or
neutrally stable. Using methods of linear control theory we find that the
system dynamics linearised around these equilibria are both controllable and
observable for almost all actuator and sensor locations. The design of the
feedback control is based on the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) compensator.
Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control and the key
finding is that Kasper Wing configurations are in general more controllable
than their single plate counterparts and also exhibit larger basins of
attraction under LQG feedback control. The feedback control is then applied to
systems with additional perturbations added to the flow in the form of random
fluctuations of the angle of attack and a vorticity shedding mechanism. Another
important observation is that, in the presence of these additional
perturbations, the control remains robust, provided the system does not deviate
too far from its original state. Furthermore, introducing a vorticity shedding
mechanism tends to enhance the effectiveness of the control. Physical
interpretation is provided for the results of the controllability and
observability analysis as well as the response of the feedback control to
different perturbations.

describe theoretical simulations and experimental results obtained via scanning

incorporated, magnetic properties, and in particular electron spin properties
pose a problem due to their conceived isotropy in the absence of measurement.
The spin of an electron reacts with a magnetic field and thus has the
properties of a vector. However, electron spin is also isotropic, suggesting
that it does not have the properties of a vector. This central conflict in the
description of an electron's spin, we believe, is the root of many of the
paradoxical properties measured and postulated for quantum spin particles.
Exploiting a model in which the electron spin is described consistently in real
three-dimensional space - an extended electron model - we demonstrate that spin
may be described by a vector and still maintain its isotropy. In this
framework, we re-evaluate the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments, and the effect of consecutive measurements

using a cut-off function in the Fourier domain to impose a smallest length
scale when deriving the Green's function. The resulting non-singular Green's
functions are relevant to applications which are restricted to a minimum
resolved length scale (e.g. a mesh size h) and thus cannot handle the singular
Green's function of the continuous Poisson equation. We furthermore derive the
gradient vector of the non-singular Green's function, as this is useful in
applications where the Poisson equation represents potential functions of a
vector field.

for efficient neuromorphic computing still very challenging. Molecular
tailoring aims at obtaining the much more flexibly tuning plasticity has
recently generated significant interest as new paradigms toward the realization
of novel memristor-based synapses. Herein, inspired by the deliberate oxygen
transport carried by the hemoglobin in our blood circulation, we report a novel
molecular-regulated electronic/ionic semiconducting (MEIS) platform
ITO/MTPP/Al2O3-x/Al with a series of metallophorphyrins (MTPPs) to delicately
regulate the ionic migration for robust molecular multimedia memristors. The
stable pinched hysteresis resulted from the coordination-regulated ionic
migration was verified by different device structures, operation modes, as well
as the characterizations of scanning transmission electron microscopy with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Metal coordination-dependent device parameters such as
potential and depression as well as retention curves further support the
correlation between the coordination and stimulating flux-dependent memristive
behaviors. In the 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphyrin zinc(II) (ZnTPP)
synapse, we implement versatile emulations, mainly including transition from
short-term memory (STM) to long-term-memory (LTM), learning experience and
activity-dependent learning-memory process in integrated neuromorphic
configurations based on the biological Hebbian rules, and develop the fresh
Spike-Amplitude-Dependent-Plasticity (SADP) with the applications of signal
filtering and habituation and sensitization which are beyond the prevalent
Hebbian rules.

multiple speech streams given the single channel of mixed speech, without first
separating them. Our technique is based on permutation invariant training (PIT)
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In PIT-ASR, we compute the average
cross entropy (CE) over all frames in the whole utterance for each possible
output-target assignment, pick the one with the minimum CE, and optimize for
that assignment. PIT-ASR forces all the frames of the same speaker to be
aligned with the same output layer. This strategy elegantly solves the label
permutation problem and speaker tracing problem in one shot. Our experiments on
artificially mixed AMI data showed that the proposed approach is very
promising.

  Synaptic Response Functions Applied to Liquid State Machines","8 pages, 4 Figures, Preprint of 2017 IJCNN",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information in neural networks is represented as weighted connections, or
synapses, between neurons. This poses a problem as the primary computational
bottleneck for neural networks is the vector-matrix multiply when inputs are
multiplied by the neural network weights. Conventional processing architectures
are not well suited for simulating neural networks, often requiring large
amounts of energy and time. Additionally, synapses in biological neural
networks are not binary connections, but exhibit a nonlinear response function
as neurotransmitters are emitted and diffuse between neurons. Inspired by
neuroscience principles, we present a digital neuromorphic architecture, the
Spiking Temporal Processing Unit (STPU), capable of modeling arbitrary complex
synaptic response functions without requiring additional hardware components.
We consider the paradigm of spiking neurons with temporally coded information
as opposed to non-spiking rate coded neurons used in most neural networks. In
this paradigm we examine liquid state machines applied to speech recognition
and show how a liquid state machine with temporal dynamics maps onto the
STPU-demonstrating the flexibility and efficiency of the STPU for instantiating
neural algorithms.
