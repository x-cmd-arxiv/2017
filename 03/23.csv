evaluation of the quasiparticle interference patterns the unpertrubated linear

also reveal the intact nature of the giant Rashba-split surface states of the

functional theory by an inward relaxation of the Bi atoms at the interface and
subsequent delocalisation of the wave function of the surface states. Our

subject to random scalar potentials with time-reversal-symmetric spin-mixing
tunneling (SMT) and spin-preserving tunneling (SPT) at potential saddle points
(PSPs). A symplectic quantum network model, named as SMT-QNM, is constructed in
which SMT and SPT have the same status and contribute independent tunneling
channels rather than sharing a total-probability-fixed one. Two-dimensional
continuous Dirac Hamiltonian is then extracted out from this discrete network
model as the generator of certain unitary transformation. With the help of
high-accuracy numerics based on transfer matrix technique, finite-size analysis
on two-terminal conductance and normalized localization length provides a phase
diagram drawn in the SMT-SPT plane. As a manifestation of symplectic ensembles,
a normal-metal (NM) phase emerges between the quantum spin Hall (QSH) and
normal-insulator (NI) phases when SMT appears. We systematically analyze the
quantum phases on the boundary and in the interior of the phase space.
Particularly, the phase diagram is closely related to that of disordered
three-dimensional weak topological insulators by appropriate parameter mapping.
At last, if time-reversal symmetry in electron trajectories between PSPs is
destroyed, the system falls into unitary class with no more NM phase. A direct
SMT-driven transition from QSH to NI phases exists and can be explained by
spin-flip backscattering between the degenerate doublets at the same sample
edge.

node-link diagrams are helpful in judging connectivity, they do not scale to
large networks. Adjacency matrices also do not scale to large networks and are
only suitable to judge connectivity of adjacent nodes. A key approach to
realize scalable graph visualization are queries: instead of displaying the
whole network, only a relevant subset is shown. Query-based techniques for
analyzing connectivity in graphs, however, can also easily suffer from
cluttering if the query result is big enough. To remedy this, we introduce
techniques that provide an overview of the connectivity and reveal details on
demand. We have two main contributions: (1) two novel visualization techniques

at problem instances with huge inputs and output. For graph problems, the input
graph is accessed using probes: strong probes (SP) specify a vertex $v$ and
receive as a reply a list of $v$'s neighbors, and weak probes (WP) specify a
vertex $v$ and a port number $i$ and receive as a reply $v$'s $i^{th}$
neighbor. Given a local query (e.g., ""is a certain vertex in the vertex cover
of the input graph?""), an LCA should compute the corresponding local output
(e.g., ""yes"" or ""no"") while making only a small number of probes, with the
requirement that all local outputs form a single global solution (e.g., a legal
vertex cover). We study the probe complexity of LCAs that are required to work
on graphs that may have arbitrarily large degrees. In particular, such LCAs are
expected to probe the graph a number of times that is significantly smaller
than the maximum, average, or even minimum degree.
  For weak probes, we focus on the weak coloring problem. Among our results we
show a separation between weak 3-coloring and weak 2-coloring for deterministic
LCAs: $\log^* n + O(1)$ weak probes suffice for weak 3-coloring, but
$\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$ weak probes are required for
weak 2-coloring.
  For strong probes, we consider randomized LCAs for vertex cover and
maximal/maximum matching. Our negative results include showing that there are
graphs for which finding a \emph{maximal} matching requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
strong probes. On the positive side, we design a randomized LCA that finds a
$(1-\epsilon)$ approximation to \emph{maximum} matching in regular graphs, and
uses $\frac{1}{\epsilon }^{O\left( \frac{1}{\epsilon ^2}\right)}$ probes,
independently of the number of vertices and of their degrees.

memories, or we may quickly forget it. Recent work finds that this likelihood
of encoding a given entity - memorability - is highly consistent across viewers
and intrinsic to an image; people tend to remember and forget the same images.
However, several forces influence our memories beyond the memorability of the
stimulus itself - for example, how attention-grabbing the stimulus is, how much
attentional resources we dedicate to the task, or how primed we are for that
stimulus. How does memorability interact with these various phenomena, and
could any of them explain the effects of memorability found in prior work? This
study uses five psychophysical experiments to explore the link between
memorability and three attention-related phenomena: 1) bottom-up attention
(through testing spatial cueing and visual search), 2) top-down attention
(through testing cognitive control and depth of encoding), and 3) priming.
These experiments find that memorability remains resilient to all of these
phenomena - none are able to explain memorability effects or overcome the
strong effects memorability has on determining memory performance. Thus,
memorability is truly an independent, intrinsic attribute of an image that
works in conjunction with these phenomena to determine if an event will
ultimately be remembered.

ZnO/MgZnO QWs the strength of such a coupling can be as high as 1.5 times the
LO-phonon frequency due to the very dense 2DEG achieved and the large
difference between the static and high-frequency dielectric constants in ZnO.
The ISB polaron is observed optically in multiple QW structures with 2DEG
densities ranging from $5\times 10^{12}$ to $5\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, where
an unprecedented regime is reached in which the frequency of the upper ISB

Because of the analyticity, there is a contribution of complex-valued
instantons, so-called fuzzy instantons. If we have a massless scalar field,
then we obtain Euclidean wormholes, where the probabilities become smaller and
smaller as the size of the throat becomes larger and larger. If we introduce a
non-trivial potential, then in order to obtain a non-zero tunneling rate, we
need to tune the shape of the potential. With the $O(4)$ symmetry, after the
analytic continuation to the Lorentzian time, the wormhole throat should expand
to infinity. However, by adding mass, one may obtain an instant wormhole that
should eventually collapse to the event horizon. The existence of Euclidean
wormholes is related to the stability or unitarity issues of anti-de Sitter

novel Bayesian mixed-effects model that exploits cross-taxa correlations within

global tests for treatment effects, local tests and estimation of treatment
effects on individual taxa, quantification of the relative contribution from
heterogeneous sources to microbiome variability, and identification of latent
ecological subcommunities in the microbiome. MIMIX is tailored to large

the SM extended by a complex singlet field (CxSM), the singlet extension of the

masses can arise in a warped extra dimensional/composite Higgs framework. In a
previous paper, we initiated the study of signals at the LHC for the associated
$\sim$ TeV mass SM singlet neutrinos, within a canonical model of $SU(2)_L
\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{ B - L }$ (LR) symmetry in the composite sector, as
motivated by consistency with the EW precision tests. Here, we investigate LHC
signals in a different region of parameter space for the same model, where
production of singlet neutrinos can occur from particles beyond those in usual
LR models. Specifically, we assume that composite $(B - L)$ gauge boson is
lighter than all the others in the EW sector. We show that the composite $(B -
L)$ gauge boson can acquire a significant coupling to light quarks simply via
mixing with elementary hypercharge gauge boson. Thus, the singlet neutrino can
be pair-produced via decays of $(B - L)$ gauge boson, without a charged current
counterpart. Furthermore, there is no decay for $(B - L)$ gauge boson directly
into dibosons, unlike for the usual case of $W_R^{ \pm }$ and $Z^{ \prime }$.
Independently of the above extension of the EW sector, we analyze production of
singlet neutrinos in decays of composite partners of $SU(2)_L$ doublet leptons,
which are absent in the usual LR models. In turn, these doublet leptons can be
produced in composite $W_L$ decays. We show that $4 - 5 \sigma$ signal can be
achieved for both cases described above for the following spectrum with 3000
fb$^{-1}$ luminosity: $2 - 2.5$ TeV composite gauge bosons, $1$ TeV composite
doublet lepton (for the second case) and $500 - 750$ GeV singlet neutrino.

potential strength, we find that trigonal warping splits the single Dirac peak
into two distinct peaks, leading to valley polarization. We obtain the
transmission curves from tight-binding simulations and find that they are in
very good agreement with the results of a billiard model that incorporates
trigonal warping. Furthermore, the positions of the transmission maxima and the

reveal rotating disks in five of the nine galaxies. The dust-corrected H-alpha
star formation rates are low (0.2 - 7 Msun/yr), and place these systems
significantly below the main sequence. The 24micron-based infrared
luminosities, instead, overestimate the star formation rates. These galaxies
present a lower gas-phase metallicity compared to star-forming objects with

conclude that the low-level star formation activity in these nine quiescent

for cosmology at scales $10\, {\rm kpc}$ or less. An effective operator
approach for the axion mass provides a general framework for models of
ultralight axions, and in one case recovers the scale $10^{-21}-10^{-22}$ eV as
the electroweak scale times the square of the hierarchy with an $O(1)$ Wilson
coefficient. We discuss several classes of models realizing this framework
where an ultralight axion of the necessary size can be generated. In one class
of supersymmetric models an ultralight axion is generated by instanton like
effects. In the second class higher dimensional operators involving couplings
of Higgs, standard model singlets, and axion fields naturally lead to an
ultralight axion. Further, for the class of models considered the hierarchy
between the ultralight scale and the weak scale is maintained. We also discuss
the generation of an ultralight scale within string based models. Here it is
shown that in the single modulus KKLT moduli stabilization scheme an ultralight
axion would require an ultra-low weak scale. However, within the Large Volume
Scenario, the desired hierarchy between the axion scale and the weak scale is
achieved. A general analysis of couplings of Higgs fields to instantons within
the string framework is discussed and it is shown that the condition necessary
for achieving such couplings is the existence of vector-like zero modes of the
instanton. Some of the phenomenological aspects of these models are also

emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN). While current models assume that the
IR is emitted from a dusty torus in the equatorial plane of the AGN, spatially
resolved observations indicate that the majority of the IR emission from 100 pc
in many AGN originates from the polar region, contradicting classical torus
models. The new model CAT3D-WIND builds upon the suggestion that the dusty gas
around the AGN consists of an inflowing disk and an outflowing wind. Here, it
is demonstrated that (1) such disk+wind models cover overall a similar
parameter range of observed spectral features in the IR as classical clumpy
torus models, e.g. the silicate feature strengths and mid-IR spectral slopes,
(2) they reproduce the 3-5{\mu}m bump observed in many type 1 AGN unlike torus
models, and (3) they are able to explain polar emission features seen in IR
interferometry, even for type 1 AGN at relatively low inclination, as
demonstrated for NGC3783. These characteristics make it possible to reconcile

vectors is crucial in weak lensing (and multi-probe) analyses of the large
scale structure of the universe. Analytically computed covariances are
noise-free and hence straightforward to invert, however the model
approximations might be insufficient for the statistical precision of future
cosmological data. Estimating covariances from numerical simulations improves
on these approximations, but the sample covariance estimator is inherently
noisy, which introduces uncertainties in the error bars on cosmological
parameters and also additional scatter in their best fit values. For future
surveys, reducing both effects to an acceptable level requires an unfeasibly
large number of simulations.
  In this paper we describe a way to expand the true precision matrix around a
covariance model and show how to estimate the leading order terms of this
expansion from simulations. This is especially powerful if the covariance
matrix is the sum of two contributions, $\smash{\mathbf{C} =
\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}}$, where $\smash{\mathbf{A}}$ is well understood
analytically and can be turned off in simulations (e.g. shape-noise for cosmic
shear) to yield a direct estimate of $\smash{\mathbf{B}}$. We test our method
in mock experiments resembling tomographic weak lensing data vectors from the
Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telecope (LSST). For DES
we find that $400$ N-body simulations are sufficient to achive negligible
statistical uncertainties on parameter constraints. For LSST this is achieved
with $2400$ simulations. The standard covariance estimator would require
>$10^5$ simulations to reach a similar precision. We extend our analysis to a
DES multi-probe case finding a similar performance.

Following Steffen (2016), we consider the effects of the observational biases
of the two methods as a possible cause for this difference. We find that at
short orbital periods ($P<11$ day), the two methods produce statistically
similar results, whereas at long periods ($P>11$ day) the RV masses are
systematically higher than the TTV ones. We suggest that this is consistent
with an RV detection-sensitivity bias for longer periods. On the other hand, we
do find an apparently significant difference between the short and the
long-period planets, obtained by both observing techniques-the mass-radius
relationship parameterized as a power law has a steeper index at short periods
than at long periods. We also point out another anticipated observational bias
between the two techniques - multiple planet systems with derived RV masses
have substantially larger period ratios than the systems with TTV mass

$\gtrsim 10\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ during its prior evolution. If a tiny fraction of
this gas is retained until the merger, the recoil and sudden mass loss of the
merged black hole shocks and heats it within hours of the GW event. Whether
resulting EM emission is detectable is uncertain. The optical depth through the

ascribed to unidentified active galactic nuclei. Improved sky-localization

Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). The region of NMSSM
parameter space favored by a 125\,GeV SM-like Higgs and naturalness generically
features a light Higgs and neutralino spectrum as well as a large
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ coupling between the Higgs doublets and the NMSSM singlet
fields. In such regimes, the heavier Higgs bosons can decay dominantly into
lighter Higgs bosons and neutralinos. We study the prospects of observing such
decays at the 13\,TeV LHC, focusing on mono-Higgs signatures as probes of such
regions of parameter space. We present results in a model-independent framework
as well as in the NMSSM. In the NMSSM, we find that the mono-Higgs channel can
probe TeV scale Higgs bosons and has sensitivity even in the low tan$\beta$,
large $m_A$ regime that is difficult to probe in the MSSM. Unlike for many
conventional Higgs searches, the reach of the mono-Higgs channel will improve
significantly with the increased luminosity expected to be collected at the LHC
in the ongoing and upcoming runs.

systems literature, and the unpredictable nature of some multi-agent
communications has been successfully modeled using random communication graphs.
Across both network control and network optimization, a common assumption is
that the union of agents' communication graphs is connected across any finite
interval of some prescribed length, and some convergence results explicitly
depend upon this length. Despite the prevalence of this assumption and the
prevalence of random graphs in studying multi-agent systems, to the best of our
knowledge, there has not been a study dedicated to determining how many random
graphs must be in a union before it is connected. To address this point, this
paper solves two related problems. The first bounds the number of random graphs
required in a union before its expected algebraic connectivity exceeds the
minimum needed for connectedness. The second bounds the probability that a
union of random graphs is connected. The random graph model used is the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, and, in solving these problems, we also bound the
expectation and variance of the algebraic connectivity of unions of such
graphs. Numerical results for several use cases are given to supplement the

at suitable scales, so that the limit under degeneration is not identically

which is a big and important challenge, since most of non-perturbative
calculations are done in Euclidean space, e.g. Lattice and Schwinger-Dyson

ladder and cross-ladder exchanges. In order to check that the NIR is also a
good representation in 2+1, the coupling constants and Wick-rotated amplitudes
have been computed and compared with calculations performed in Euclidean space.
Very good agreement between the calculations performed in the Minkowski and
Euclidean spaces has been found. This is an important consistence test that
allows Minkowski calculations with the Nakanishi representation in 2+1

occurred at the nucleus of a known Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy hosting a

IIn SLSN due to its luminosity and hydrogen emission lines. The light curve
shows that PS16dtm brightened by about two magnitudes in ~50 days relative to
the archival host brightness and then exhibited a plateau phase for about 100
days followed by the onset of fading in the UV. During the plateau PS16dtm
showed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of 1.7 x 10$^4$
K, and radiated at approximately $L_{Edd}$ of the SMBH. The spectra exhibit
multi-component hydrogen emission lines and strong FeII emission, show little
evolution with time, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being
distinct from those of Type IIn SNe. Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the
X-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of
its host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity
associated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with a SN origin or any
known form of AGN variability, and therefore we argue that it is a TDE in which
the accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and
excitation of the pre-existing broad line region, while providing material that
obscures the X-ray emitting region of the pre-existing AGN accretion disk. A
detailed TDE model fit to the light curve indicates that PS16dtm will remain
bright for several years; we further predict that the X-ray emission will
reappear on a similar timescale as the accretion rate declines. Finally, we
place PS16dtm in the context of other TDEs and find that TDEs in AGN galaxies
are an order of magnitude more efficient and reach Eddington luminosities,
likely due to interaction of the stellar debris with the pre-existing accretion
disk.

perturbations from the environment, such as electromagnetic oscillations or
mechanical vibrations. On the one hand, this limits sensitive quantum phase
measurements as it reduces the interference contrast. On the other hand, it
enables single-particle interferometers to be used as sensitive sensors for
electromagnetic and mechanical perturbations. Recently, it was demonstrated
experimentally, that a second-order correlation analysis can decrease the
shielding and damping requirements significantly. Thereby, the relevant
matter-wave characteristics and perturbation parameters could be extracted from
the correlation analysis of a ""washed-out"" interference pattern and the
undisturbed interferogram could be reconstructed. This method can be applied to
all interferometers, that produce a spatial fringe pattern on a detector with
high spatial and temporal single-particle resolution. In this article, we
present and discuss in detail the used two-dimensional second-order correlation
theory for multifrequency perturbations. The derivations of an explicit and
approximate solution of the correlation function and corresponding amplitude
spectra are provided. It is explained, how the numerical correlation function
is extracted from the measurement data. Thereby, the influence of the temporal
and spatial discretization step size on the extracted parameters is analyzed.
The influence of noise on the correlation function and amplitude spectrum is
calculated and numerically cross-checked by a comparison of our theory with
numerical single-particle simulations. Our method can also be applied for the
analysis of broad-band frequency noise, dephasing the interference pattern.
Using Gaussian distributed noise in the simulations, we demonstrate that the
relevant matter-wave parameters and the applied perturbation spectrum can be
revealed.

As result, the QCD vacuum instantons induce very strong interactions between
light quarks, initially almost massless. Such a strong interactions bring a
large dynamical mass M of the light quarks and bound them to produce almost
massless pions in accordance with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral
symmetry (SBCS). On the other hand, the QCD vacuum instantons also interact
with heavy quarks and responsible for the generation of the heavy-heavy and

and energy confinement to maximize fusion power output. However, there is a
limit to the maximum achievable elongation which is set by vertical
instabilities driven by the $n=0$ MHD mode. This limit can be increased by
optimizing several parameters characterizing the plasma and the wall. The
purpose of our study is to explore how and to what extent this can be done.
Specifically, we extend many earlier calculations of the $n=0$ mode and
numerically determine scaling relations for the maximum elongation as a
function of dimensionless parameters describing (1) the plasma profile
($\beta_p$ and $l_i$), (2) the plasma shape ($\epsilon$ and $\delta$), (3) the
wall radius ($b/a$) and (4) most importantly the feedback system capability
parameter $\gamma\tau_w$. These numerical calculations rely on a new
formulation of $n=0$ MHD theory we recently developed [Freidberg et. al. 2015;
Lee et. al. 2015] that reduces the 2-D stability problem into a 1-D problem.
This method includes all the physics of the ideal MHD axisymmetric instability
while reducing the computation time significantly, so that many parameters can
be explored during the optimization process. Perhaps the most useful final
result is a simple analytic fit to the simulations which gives the maximum
elongation and corresponding optimized triangularity as functions
$\kappa(\epsilon,\beta_p,l_i,b/a,\gamma\tau_w)$ and
$\delta(\epsilon,\beta_p,l_i,b/a,\gamma\tau_w)$. The scaling relations we
present include the effects of the optimal triangularity and the finite aspect
ratio on the maximum elongation, and can be useful for determining optimized
plasma shapes in current experiments and future tokamak designs.

structure emission at 158 um traces the SFR. Intensity mapping surveys the
cumulative surface brightness of emitting lines as a function of redshift,
rather than individual galaxies. CMB spectral distortion instruments are
sensitive to both the mean and anisotropy of the intensity of redshifted CO and
[CII] emission. Large-scale anisotropy is proportional to the product of the
mean surface brightness and the line luminosity-weighted bias. The bias
provides a connection between galaxy evolution and its cosmological context,
and is a unique asset of intensity mapping. Cross-correlation with galaxy
redshift surveys allows unambiguous measurements of redshifted line brightness
despite residual continuum contamination and interlopers. Measurement of line
brightness through cross-correlation also evades cosmic variance and suggests
new observation strategies. Galactic foreground emission is $\sim 10^3$ times
larger than the expected signals, and this places stringent requirements on
instrument calibration and stability. Under a range of assumptions, a linear
combination of bands cleans continuum contamination sufficiently that residuals
produce a modest penalty over the instrumental noise. For PIXIE, the $2 \sigma$

illumination. In general these methods require complex and inefficient
pipelines for model building and fitting. In this work, we propose to address
many of these limitations by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on
an appropriate dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D facial models or scans.
Our CNN works with just a single 2D facial image, does not require accurate

arbitrary facial poses and expressions, and can be used to reconstruct the
whole 3D facial geometry (including the non-visible parts of the face)

direct regression of a volumetric representation of the 3D facial geometry from

localization can be incorporated into the proposed framework and help improve
reconstruction quality, especially for the cases of large poses and facial

order $n$ has cardinality at most \[\frac{1}{2} n\sqrt{4tn - (3t + 1)(t - 1)} +
\frac{1}{2} (t - 1)n + t.\] This is the first general upper bound on the size
of minimal $t$-fold blocking sets in finite projective planes and it
generalizes the classical result of Bruen and Thas on minimal blocking sets.
From the proof it directly follows that if equality occurs in this bound then
every line intersects the blocking set $S$ in either $t$ points or
$\frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{4tn - (3t + 1)(t - 1)} + t - 1) + 1$ points. We use this to
show that for $n$ a prime power, equality can occur in our bound in exactly one
of the following three cases: (a) $t = 1$, $n$ is a square and $S$ is a unital;
(b) $t = n - \sqrt{n}$, $n$ is a square and $S$ is the complement of a Baer
subplane; (c) $t = n$ and $S$ is equal to the set of all points except one. For
a square prime power $q$ and $t \leq \sqrt{q} + 1$, we give a construction of a
minimal $t$-fold blocking set $S$ in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ with $|S| = q\sqrt{q} +
1 + (t - 1)(q - \sqrt{q} + 1)$. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the
size of minimal blocking sets in symmetric $2$-designs and use it to give new
proofs of other known results regarding tangency sets in higher dimensional
finite projective spaces. We also discuss further generalizations of our bound.
In our proofs we use an incidence bound on combinatorial designs which follows
from applying the expander mixing lemma to the incidence graph of these

$T$-gates that has a low space overhead and uses an asymptotic number of input
magic states to achieve a given target error that is conjectured to be optimal.
The space overhead, defined as the ratio between the physical qubits to the
number of output magic states, is asymptotically constant, while both the
number of input magic states used per output state and the $T$-gate depth of
the circuit scale linearly in the logarithm of the target error $\delta$ (up to
$\log \log 1/\delta$). Unlike other distillation protocols, this protocol
achieves this performance without concatenation and the input magic states are
injected at various steps in the circuit rather than all at the start of the
circuit. The protocol can be modified to distill magic states for other gates
at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, with the same asymptotic
performance. The protocol relies on the construction of weakly self-dual CSS
codes with many logical qubits and large distance, allowing us to implement
control-SWAPs on multiple qubits. We call this code the ""inner code"". The
control-SWAPs are then used to measure properties of the magic state and detect
errors, using another code that we call the ""outer code"". Alternatively, we use
weakly-self dual CSS codes which implement controlled Hadamards for the inner
code, reducing circuit depth. We present several specific small examples of
this protocol.

ranges, the damping rate of this oscillation is determined by the electron-ion

such parameters and compared the measured rates to both a molecular dynamic

collisional operator simulation designed to predict the damping rate including
only weak coupling considerations. We found agreement between experimentally
measured damping rate and the MD result. This agreement did require including
the influence of a previously unreported UCP heating mechanism whereby the
presence of a DC electric field during ionization increased the electron
temperature, but estimations and simulations indicate that such a heating
mechanism should be present for our parameters. The measured damping rate at
our coldest electron temperature conditions was much faster than the weak

distances between observations. The idea behind energy statistics is to
consider a statistical potential energy that would parallel Newton's
gravitational potential energy. This statistical potential energy is zero if
and only if a certain null hypothesis relating two distributions holds true. In
Szekely and Rizzo(2004), a nonparametric test for equality of two multivariate
distributions was given, based on the Euclidean distance between observations.
This test was shown to be effective for high dimensional multivariate data, and
was implemented by an appropriate distribution free permutation test. As an
extension of Szekely and Rizzo (2013), here we consider the energy distance
between to independent random objects X and Y on the object space M, that
admits an embedding into an Euclidean space. In the case of a Kendall shape
space, we can use its VW-embedding into an Euclidean space of matrices and
define the extrinsic distance between two shapes as their VW associated
distance. The corresponding energy distance between two distributions of
Kendall shapes of k-ads will be called VW-energy distance We test our

qualitatively. We use real-space analysis of microscopic images to quantify the

integrity fraction, as a measure of structural array integrity. Reproducible
procedures to determine the imaged number of array elements are introduced.
Thus, quantitative comparisons of different nanorod arrays, or of one nanorod

Abstract shortened due to character limit",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is an important tool for managing
high-dimensional noisy or uncertain data, for example in connection with data
cleaning (similarity join) and noise-robust search (similarity search).
However, for a number of problems the LSH framework is not known to yield good
solutions, and instead ad hoc solutions have been designed for particular
similarity and distance measures. For example, this is true for
output-sensitive similarity search/join, and for indexes supporting annulus
queries that aim to report a point close to a certain given distance from the
query point.
  In this paper we initiate the study of distance-sensitive hashing (DSH), a
generalization of LSH that seeks a family of hash functions such that the
probability of two points having the same hash value is a given function of the
distance between them. More precisely, given a distance space $(X,
\text{dist})$ and a ""collision probability function"" (CPF) $f\colon
\mathbb{R}\rightarrow [0,1]$ we seek a distribution over pairs of functions
$(h,g)$ such that for every pair of points $x, y \in X$ the collision
probability is $\Pr[h(x)=g(y)] = f(\text{dist}(x,y))$. Locality-sensitive
hashing is the study of how fast a CPF can decrease as the distance grows. For
many spaces, $f$ can be made exponentially decreasing even if we restrict
attention to the symmetric case where $g=h$. We show that the asymmetry
achieved by having a pair of functions makes it possible to achieve CPFs that
are, for example, increasing or unimodal, and show how this leads to principled
solutions to problems not addressed by the LSH framework. This includes a novel
application to privacy-preserving distance estimation. We believe that the DSH
framework will find further applications in high-dimensional data management.

rendering, which turns only a fraction of the user's real environment into AR

are commonly equipped with video see-through capabilities, AR magic lens
applications often suffer from spatial distortions, because the AR environment
is presented from the perspective of the camera of the mobile device. Recent
approaches counteract this distortion based on estimations of the user's head
position, rendering the scene from the user's perspective. To this end,
approaches usually apply face-tracking algorithms on the front camera of the
mobile device. However, this demands high computational resources and therefore
commonly affects the performance of the application beyond the already high
computational load of AR applications. In this paper, we present a method to
reduce the computational demands for user perspective rendering by applying
lightweight optical flow tracking and an estimation of the user's motion before
head tracking is started. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach for
computationally limited mobile devices and we compare it to device perspective
rendering, to head tracked user perspective rendering, as well as to fixed

number for which one can find two tree-decompositions such that each bag of the
first decomposition intersects each bag of the second in at most two vertices.
Furthermore, this remains true even if one of the two decompositions is
restricted to be a path-decomposition. This is shown using a construction of
triangle-free graphs with unbounded chromatic number due to Burling, which we

reconstruction method corrects the bulk motion associated with the
gravitational evolution using the inverse Zel'dovich approximation (ZA) for the
smoothed density field. We find that the overall amplitude of one-loop
contributions in the matter power spectrum substantially decrease after
reconstruction. The reconstructed power spectrum thereby approaches the initial
linear spectrum when the smoothed density field is close enough to linear,
i.e., the smoothing scale $R_s$ larger than around 10$h^{-1}$Mpc. On smaller
$R_s$,however, the deviation from the linear spectrum becomes significant on
large scales ($k\lt R_s^{-1}$) due to the nonlinearity in the smoothed density
field, and the reconstruction is inaccurate. Compared with N-body simulations,
we show that the reconstructed power spectrum at one loop order agrees with
simulations better than the unreconstructed power spectrum. We also calculate
the tree-level bispectrum in standard perturbation theory to investigate
non-Gaussianity in the reconstructed matter density field. We show that the

solve a large class of nonlinear filtering problems. However, standard particle
filters with importance weights have been shown to require a sample size that
increases exponentially with the dimension D of the state space in order to
achieve a certain performance, which precludes their use in very
high-dimensional filtering problems. Here, we focus on the dynamic aspect of
this curse of dimensionality (COD) in continuous time filtering, which is
caused by the degeneracy of importance weights over time. We show that the
degeneracy occurs on a time-scale that decreases with increasing D. In order to
soften the effects of weight degeneracy, most particle filters use particle
resampling and improved proposal functions for the particle motion. We explain
why neither of the two can prevent the COD in general. In order to address this
fundamental problem, we investigate an existing filtering algorithm based on
optimal feedback control that sidesteps the use of importance weights. We use
numerical experiments to show that this Feedback Particle Filter (FPF) by Yang

significantly faster for holes compared to electrons, and that for hot carriers

$\sim$1 ps. The asymmetry in the hot carrier dynamics is shown to originate
from the valence band degeneracy, the heavier effective mass of holes compared
to electrons, and the details of the coupling to different phonon modes in the
valence and conduction bands. We show that the slow cooling of hot electrons

well-studied and active research fields, at the intersection of signal and

dictionary learning, the current methods of choice are arguably K-SVD and its
variants, which learn a dictionary (i.e., a decomposition) for sparse coding
via Singular Value Decomposition. In robust component analysis, leading methods
derive from Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), which recovers a low-rank matrix
from sparse corruptions of unknown magnitude and support. However, K-SVD is
sensitive to the presence of noise and outliers in the training set.
Additionally, PCP does not provide a dictionary that respects the structure of
the data (e.g., images), and requires expensive SVD computations when solved by
convex relaxation. In this paper, we introduce a new robust decomposition of
images by combining ideas from sparse dictionary learning and PCP. We propose a
novel Kronecker-decomposable component analysis which is robust to gross
corruption, can be used for low-rank modeling, and leverages separability to
solve significantly smaller problems. We design an efficient learning algorithm

planetesimals in the middle regions (3-100 au). Our most comprehensive model
forms 8 $M_\oplus$ of planetesimals inside 3 au, where they can give rise to
terrestrial planets. The planetesimal mass formed in the inner disk depends
critically on the timing of the formation of an inner cavity in the disk by
high-energy photons. Our results show that the combination of photoevaporation

We extend the results shown by R. Bartnik and G. Fodor for the 3-dimensional

mentioned authors are valid in arbitrary dimensions, and on the other hand we
show that the geometric hypotheses needed for the proofs can always be
satisfied, which constitutes in itself a new result for the 3-dimensional case.
In this way, we show that on any compact n-dimensional manifold, n greater or

However, once the number of residue errors is beyond half the minimum distance

formulated. Furthermore, a simple closed-form reconstruction algorithm is also

Besides, to sufficiently capture the spectral information, a bidirectional

the channel states and traffic demand are taken into account. The channel
states includes sparse and rich scattering terrains, and the traffic patterns
includes delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive as well as hybrid. Some
important results are obtained in theory. In sparse scattering terrains, for
delay-sensitive traffic, the PAWAS can be viewed as the generalization of
channel-inversion associated with transmit antenna selection. On the contrary,
for delay-insensitive traffic, the power allocation with MIMO can be viewed as
channel-inversion, but with SIMO, it is traditional water-filling. For the
hybrid traffic, the PAWAS can be partitioned as delay-sensitive and
delay-insensitive parts by some specific strategies. In rich scattering
terrains, the corresponding PAWAS is derived by some amendments in sparse
scattering terrains and similar results are then presented.

circumplanetary disks using orbital integrations. We find that the number of
captured planetesimals reaches an equilibrium state as a balance between
continuous capture and orbital decay into the planet. The number of
planetesimals captured into retrograde orbits is much smaller than those on
prograde orbits, because the former ones experience strong headwind and spiral
into the planet rapidly. We find that the surface number density of
planetesimals at the current radial location of regular satellites can be
significantly enhanced by gas drag capture, depending on the velocity
dispersions of planetesimals and the width of the gap in the protoplanetary
disk. Using a simple model, we also examine the ratio of the surface densities
of dust and captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk, and find that
solid material at the current location of regular satellites can be dominated
by captured planetesimals when the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is
rather small and a wide gap is not formed in the protoplanetary disk. In this
case, captured planetesimals in such a region can grow by mutual collision
before spiraling into the planet, and would contribute to the growth of regular
satellites.

created a new fashion culture database (FCDB), which consists of 76 million
geo-tagged images in 16 cosmopolitan cities. By grasping a fashion trend of
mixed fashion styles,the paper also proposes an unsupervised fashion trend
descriptor (FTD) using a fashion descriptor, a codeword vetor, and temporal

effectively emphasizes consecutive features between two different times. In
experiments, we clearly show the analysis of fashion trends and fashion-based

visualization in a time series. The code, model, and FCDB will be publicly

announced the possibility of this new method. We apply this method to several

information of $H(z)$ by DECIGO to simulate $H(z)$ data at every 0.1 redshift
span, and put the mock data into the forecasting of cosmological parameters.
Compared with the available 38 observed $H(z)$ data(OHD), mock data shows an
obviously tighter constraint on cosmological parameters, and a concomitantly
higher value of Figure of Merit(FoM). For a 3-year-observation by standard
sirens of DECIGO, the FoM value is as high as 834.9. If a 10-year-observation

behaviors of complex dynamical systems, as well as a classical setup for
classroom demonstrations of synchronization phenomena. Whereas previous studies
of metronome synchronization have been concentrating on symmetric coupling
schemes, here we consider the asymmetric case by adopting the scheme of layered
metronomes. Specifically, we place two metronomes on each layer, and couple two
layers by placing one on top of the other. By varying the initial conditions of
the metronomes and adjusting the friction between the two layers, a variety of
synchronous patterns are observed in experiment, including the splay
synchronization (SS) state, the generalized splay synchronization (GSS) state ,
the anti-phase synchronization (APS) state, the in-phase delay synchronization
(IPDS) state, and the in-phase synchronization (IPS) state. In particular, the
IPDS state, in which the metronomes on each layer are synchronized in phase but
are of a constant phase delay to metronomes on the other layer, is observed for
the first time. In addition, a new technique based on audio signals is proposed
for pattern detection, which is more convenient and easier to apply than the
existing acquisition techniques. Furthermore, a theoretical model is developed
to explain the experimental observations, and is employed to explore the
dynamical properties of the patterns, including the basin distributions and the
pattern transitions. Our study sheds new lights on the collective behaviors of
coupled metronomes, and the developed setup can be used in the classroom for
demonstration purposes.

state space, to introduce some form of approximation architecture for the value
function (VF). The exact form of this architecture can have a significant
effect on an agent's performance, however, and determining a suitable
approximation architecture can often be a highly complex task. Consequently
there is currently interest among researchers in the potential for allowing RL
algorithms to adaptively generate (i.e. to learn) approximation architectures.
One relatively unexplored method of adapting approximation architectures
involves using feedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited
certain states to guide which areas of the state space to approximate with
greater detail. In this article we will: (a) informally discuss the potential
advantages offered by such methods; (b) introduce a new algorithm based on such

  We impose a permutation symmetry S3 upon the two Higgs doublet extension of
the SU(2) x U( 1) standard model, and then break S3 symmetry spontaneously. A
mass relation is obtained from which the mass of the top quark is predicted to
be 39 Gev at 1 Gev renormalization scale, if the relative strength between the
coupling of the first Higgs field with the up-type quarks is assumed to be the
same as that with the down-type quarks. We find that in our model the flavor
changing neutral currents vanish automatically.

function for characterizing asymptotic stability of complex balanced mass
action systems (MASs), this paper develops the generalized pseudo-Helmholtz
function for stability analysis for more general MASs assisted with
conservation laws. The key technique is to transform the original network into
two different MASs, defined by reconstruction and reverse reconstruction, with
an important aspect that the dynamics of the original network for free species
is equivalent to that of the reverse reconstruction. Stability analysis of the
original network is then conducted based on an analysis of how stability
properties are retained from the original network to the reverse
reconstruction. We prove that the reverse reconstruction possesses only an
equilibrium in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class if the
corresponding reconstruction is complex balanced. Under this complex balanced
reconstruction strategy, the asymptotic stability of the reverse
reconstruction, which also applies to the original network, is thus reached by
taking the generalized pseudo-Helmholtz function as the Lyapunov function. To
facilitate applications, we further provide a systematic method for computing
complex balanced reconstructions assisted with conservation laws. Some
representative examples are presented to exhibit the validity of the complex
balanced reconstruction strategy.

(silent or potential) synapses. The computational role of zero synapses in
unsupervised feature learning of unlabeled noisy data is still unclear, thus it
is important to understand how the sparseness of synaptic activity is shaped
during learning and its relationship with receptive field formation. Here, we
formulate this kind of sparse feature learning by a statistical mechanics
approach. We find that learning decreases the fraction of zero synapses, and
when the fraction decreases rapidly around a critical data size, an
intrinsically structured receptive field starts to develop. Further increasing
the data size refines the receptive field, while a very small fraction of zero
synapses remain to act as contour detectors. This phenomenon is discovered not
only in learning a handwritten digits dataset, but also in learning retinal
neural activity measured in a natural-movie-stimuli experiment.

FSVRG to directly solve the problems with non-smooth component functions, such

reader interested in applications should be able read right away the results
related to those examples, beginning with Section 5. Our general, theoretical
results are that an operator adapted to the geometry is Fredholm if, and only
if, it is elliptic and all its limit operators, in a sense to be made precise,
are invertible. Central to our theoretical results is the concept of a Fredholm
groupoid, which is the class of groupoids for which this characterization of
the Fredholm condition is valid. We use the notions of exhaustive and strictly
spectral families of representations to obtain a general characterization of
Fredholm groupoids. In particular, we introduce the class of the so-called
groupoids with Exel's property as the groupoids for which the regular
representations are exhaustive. We show that the class of ""stratified
submersion groupoids"" has Exel's property, where stratified submersion
groupoids are defined by glueing fibered pull-backs of bundles of Lie groups.
We prove that a stratified submersion groupoid is Fredholm whenever its
isotropy groups are amenable. Many groupoids, and hence many pseudodifferential
operators appearing in practice, fit into this framework. This fact is explored
to yield Fredholm conditions not only in the above mentioned classes, but also
on manifolds that are obtained by desingularization or by blow-up of singular

in this paper we aim to provide a unified analysis to derive the
dimensional-invariance principles for networked coupled systems, and to
generalize the invariance principles for networked systems with more general
forms of coupling terms. To be specific, we consider two types of coupled
systems, one with scalar couplings and the other with matrix couplings. Via the
\textit{rank-preserving flow theory}, we show that any scalar-coupled dynamical
system (with constant, time-varying or state-dependent couplings) possesses the
dimensional-invariance principles, in that the dimension of the subspace

cases of time-varying couplings and state-dependent couplings. Furthermore,
subspace-preserving property and signature-preserving flows are also developed

Kirchhoff plate bending problems with mixed boundary conditions involving
clamped, simply supported, and free boundary parts. Based on a regular
decomposition of an appropriate nonstandard Sobolev space for the bending
moments, the fourth-order problem can be equivalently written as a system of
three (consecutively to solve) second-order problems in standard Sobolev
spaces. This leads to new discretization methods, which are flexible in the
sense, that any existing and well-working discretization method and solution
strategy for standard second-order problems can be used as a modular building
block of the new method.

previous work [W. Krendl, K. Rafetseder and W. Zulehner, A decomposition result

The extension to more general boundary conditions encounters several

this paper, we solve the time evolution without this approximation, which
extends the region of validity of the interaction time. For short entangling
times, we find this produces a state with similar characteristics as a two-mode
squeezed state, in agreement with standard predictions. For long entangling
times, the state evolves into a non-Gaussian form, and the two-mode squeezed
state characteristics start to diminish. This is attributed to more exotic
types of entangled states being generated. We characterize the states by

facing potential right censoring of the responses. Contrary to the existing
literature on the subject, the adopted strategy of this paper is to tackle
censoring at the very level of the loss function usually employed for the
computation of quantiles, the so-called ""check"" function. For interpretation
purposes, a simple comparison with the latter reveals how censoring is
accounted for in the newly proposed loss function. Subsequently, when
considering the inclusion of covariates for conditional quantile estimation, by
defining a new general loss function, the proposed methodology opens the gate
to numerous parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric modelling techniques.
In order to illustrate this statement, we consider the well-studied linear
regression under the usual assumption of conditional independence between the
true response and the censoring variable. For practical minimization of the
studied loss function, we also provide a simple algorithmic procedure shown to
yield satisfactory results for the proposed estimator with respect to the
existing literature in an extensive simulation study. From a more theoretical
prospect, consistency of the estimator for linear regression is obtained using
very recent results on non-smooth semiparametric estimation equations with an
infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, while numerical examples illustrate
the adequateness of a simple bootstrap procedure for inferential purposes.
Lastly, an application to a real dataset is used to further illustrate the
validity and finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.

energy density over that of magnetic field in the 7 mm core. Particle density
increased during the radio flare at the apparent jet base, affecting
synchrotron opacity. This manifested itself as an apparent core shuttle along

behavior of $S_{n}[f]$ for small parameters $\omega$ is directly extracted. An
attempt to evaluate the integral by expanding the integrand $(\omega+x)^{-n}$
about $\omega=0$ and then naively integrating the resulting infinite series
term by term lead to an infinite series whose terms are divergent integrals.
Assigning values to the divergent integrals, say, by analytic continuation or
by Hadamard's finite part is known to reproduce only some of the correct terms
of the expansion but completely misses out a group of terms. Here we evaluate
explicitly the generalized Stieltjes transform by means of finite-part
integration recently introduced in [E.A. Galapon, {\it Proc. Roy. Soc. A} {\bf
473}, 20160567 (2017)]. It is shown that, when $f(x)$ does not vanish or has
zero of order $m$ at the origin such that $(n-m)\geq 1$, the dominant terms of
$S_{n}[f]$ as $\omega\rightarrow 0$ come from contributions arising from the
poles and branch points of the complex valued function $f(z) (\omega+z)^{-n}$.
These dominant terms are precisely the terms missed out by naive term by term
integration. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how finite-part integration leads
to new series representations of special functions by exploiting their known
Stieltjes integral representations. Finally, the application of finite part
integration in obtaining asymptotic expansions of the effective diffusivity in
the limit of high Peclet number, the Green-Kubo formula for the self-diffusion
coefficient and the antisymmetric part of the diffusion tensor in the weak

introduce fully convolutional auto-encoders for image feature learning and then
propose a unified clustering framework to learn image representations and
cluster centers jointly based on a fully convolutional auto-encoder and soft
$k$-means scores. At initial stages of the learning procedure, the
representations extracted from the auto-encoder may not be very discriminative
for latter clustering. We address this issue by adopting a boosted
discriminative distribution, where high score assignments are highlighted and
low score ones are de-emphasized. With the gradually boosted discrimination,
clustering assignment scores are discriminated and cluster purities are

aphid resistance is presently available in Brassica juncea . A wild crucifer,
Brassica fruticulosa is known to be resistant to mustard aphid. An artificially
synthesized amphiploid, AD-4 (B. fruticulosa x B. rapa var. brown sarson) was
developed for use as a bridge species to transfer fruticulosa resistance to B.
juncea. Using the selfed backcross we could select a large number of lines with
resistance to mustard aphid. This paper reports cytogenetic stability of
introgression lines, molecular evidence for alien introgression and their
reaction to mustard aphid infestation. Results: Majority of introgression lines
had expected euploid chromosome number(2n= 36), showed normal meiosis and high
pollen grain fertility. Well-distributed and transferable simple-sequence
repeats (SSR) markers for all the 18 B. juncea chromosomes helped to
characterize introgression events. Average proportions of recipient and donor
genome in the substitution lines were 49.72 and 35.06%, respectively. Minimum
alien parent genome presence (27.29%) was observed in the introgression line,
Ad3K-280 . Introgressed genotypes also varied for their resistance responses to
mustard aphid infestations under artificial release conditions for two
continuous seasons. Some of the test genotypes showed consistent resistant
reaction. Conclusions: B.juncea-fruticulosa introgression set may prove to be a
very powerful breeding tool for aphid resistance related QTL/gene discovery and
fine mapping of the desired genes/QTLs to facilitate marker assisted transfer
of identified gene(s) for mustard aphid resistance in the background of
commercial mustard genotypes.

knowledge from a source set with available annotations. The source and target

To exploit this, we acquire three types of knowledge from the source set: a

between thing and stuff classes in the source. The segmentation model is used
to generate thing and stuff segmentation maps on a target image, while the

lack of matching and communication between the various technologies involved in
the distant speech recognition process. The speech enhancement and speech
recognition modules are, for instance, often trained independently. Moreover,
the speech enhancement normally helps the speech recognizer, but the output of
the latter is not commonly used, in turn, to improve the speech enhancement. To
address both concerns, we propose a novel architecture based on a network of
deep neural networks, where all the components are jointly trained and better
cooperate with each other thanks to a full communication scheme between them.
Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions,
revealed that the proposed framework can overtake other competitive solutions,
including recent joint training approaches.

finite tidal deformations for their operation: the elliptical instability and
the precessional instability. Both are likely to be important for the tidal
evolution of short-period extrasolar planets. The elliptical instability is a
fluid instability of elliptical streamlines, such as in tidally deformed
non-synchronously rotating or non-circularly orbiting planets. I summarise the
results of local and global simulations that indicate this mechanism to be
important for tidal spin synchronisation, planetary spin-orbit alignment and
orbital circularisation for the shortest period hot Jupiters. The precessional
instability is a fluid instability that occurs in planets undergoing axial
precession, such as those with spin-orbit misalignments (non-zero obliquities).
I summarise the outcome of local MHD simulations designed to study the
turbulent damping of axial precession, which suggest this mechanism to be
important in driving tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle for hot Jupiters.
Avenues for future work are also discussed.

joint consideration of energy, topology, and quantum geometry of the Chern

FCI models satisfying the criteria of band flatness, homogeneous Berry
curvature, and isotropic quantum geometry. This is accomplished by adopting a
holomorphic coordinate representation of the Bloch states spanning the basis of
the Chern band. The resultant FCI models not only exhibit extensive tunability

analytically controlled truncation schemes to accommodate any desired

superconductivity but P- and T-invariant and generalizable to any dimension.
While the original anyon superconductivity mechanism was based on
incompressible quantum Hall fluids as average field states, our mechanism
involves topological insulators as average field states. In D space dimensions
it involves a (D-1)-form fictitious pseudovector gauge field which originates
from the condensation of topological defects in compact low-energy effective BF
theories. There is no massive Higgs scalar as there is no local order
parameter. When electromagnetism is switched on, the photon acquires mass by
the topological BF mechanism. Although the charge of the gapless mode (2) and
the topological order (4) are the same as those of the standard Higgs model,
the two models of superconductivity are clearly different since the origins of
the gap, reflected in the high-energy sectors are totally different. In 2D this
type of superconductivity is explicitly realized as global superconductivity in
Josephson junction arrays. In 3D this model predicts a possible phase
transition from topological insulators to Higgsless superconductors.

superconducting state inherits the non-trivial topology of their electronic
structure. As a result, Weyl superconductors are expected to host exotic
phenomena such as non-zero-momentum pairing due to their chiral node structure,
or zero- energy Majorana modes at the surface. These are of fundamental
interest to improve our understanding of correlated topological systems, and
moreover practical applications in phase coherent devices and quantum
applications have been proposed. Proximity-induced superconductivity promises
to allow such experiments on non-superconducting Weyl semi-metals. Here we show
a new route to reliably fabricating superconducting microstructures from the
non-superconducting Weyl semi-metal NbAs under ion irradiation. The significant
difference in the surface binding energy of Nb and As leads to a natural
enrichment of Nb at the surface during ion milling, forming a superconducting
surface layer (Tc~3.5K). Being formed from the target crystal itself, the ideal
contact between the superconductor and the bulk may enable an effective gapping
of the Weyl nodes in the bulk due to the proximity effect. Simple ion
irradiation may thus serve as a powerful tool to fabricating topological
quantum devices from mono-arsenides, even on an industrial scale.

frames can be decomposed into salient and non-salient areas naturally. Salient
and non-salient areas should be modeled with different networks, for the former
present both appearance and motion information, and the latter present static
background information. To address this problem, in this paper, video saliency
is predicted by optical flow without supervision firstly. Then two streams of
3D CNN are trained individually for raw frames and optical flow on salient
areas, and another 2D CNN is trained for raw frames on non-salient areas. For
the reason that these three streams play different roles for each class, the
weights of each stream are adaptively learned for each class. Experimental
results show that saliency-guided modeling and adaptively weighted learning can
reinforce each other, and we achieve the state-of-the-art results.

with small amounts of data, and propose an additional generator network based
on the Generative Adversarial Networks where the discriminator is our residual

generated data samples. The proposed model can generate plausible variations of
exemplars over unseen classes and outperforms strong discriminative baselines

superconductors favorite them for nanoscale technologies, including radiation

behavior of superconductivity is significant for revealing the onset of
collective-electron behavior in nature. Nevertheless, the limited number of
accessible superconductors restricts availability of the superconducting
properties, encumbering the realization of their potential. Superconducting
nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) sense single-IR photons faster and
more efficient with respect to competing technologies. However, these
advantageous properties are material-dependent causing an undesirable
speed-efficiency payoff. Usually, SNSPDs based on granular materials are
faster, while those based on amorphous materials are more efficient. Here we
optimized ultrathin films of granular NbN on SiO2 and of amorphous W5Si3. We
showed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs)
made of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous
coexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and
efficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the
governing mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual
superconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and
superconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity
effect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest
that such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting
properties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies. Lastly, this
hybridization may be used to tune the amorphous character of superconducting
films and to illuminate the elusive onset of collective-electron behavior near
the superconducting-to-insulating transition.

More precisely, we provide the proper renormalizations for the extremely large

particular, in the sub-ballistic regime, we link the almost sure behavior of

the properties of such exponential functionals to characterize the sought

determined by the asymptotic behavior of the Laplace exponent of the L\'evy

a matrix $X$ obtained by multiplying $K$ matrices (called factors and
corresponding to the action of the layers). The action of each layer (i.e. a
factor) is obtained by applying a fixed linear operator to a vector of
parameters satisfying a constraint. The number of layers is not limited.
Assuming that $X$ is given and factors have been estimated, the error between
the product of the estimated factors and $X$ (i.e. the reconstruction error) is
either the statistical or the empirical risk. In this paper, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology under which a
stability property holds. The stability property requires that the error on the
parameters defining the factors (i.e. the stability of the recovered
parameters) scales linearly with the reconstruction error (i.e. the risk).
Therefore, under these conditions on the network topology, any successful
learning task leads to stably defined features and therefore interpretable
layers/network.In order to do so, we first evaluate how the Segre embedding and
its inverse distort distances. Then, we show that any deep structured linear
network can be cast as a generic multilinear problem (that uses the Segre
embedding). This is the {\em tensorial lifting}. Using the tensorial lifting,
we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of the
factors (up to a scale rearrangement). We finally provide the necessary and
sufficient condition called \NSPlong~(because of the analogy with the usual
Null Space Property in the compressed sensing framework) which guarantees that
the stability property holds. We illustrate the theory with a practical example
where the deep structured linear network is a convolutional linear network. As
expected, the conditions are rather strong but not empty. A simple test on the
network topology can be implemented to test if the condition holds.

(ConvNets) effectively learn from low-level to high-level features and
discriminative representations. Since the end goal of large-scale recognition
is to delineate complex boundaries of thousands of classes, adequate
exploration of feature distributions is important for realizing full potentials
of ConvNets. However, state-of-the-art works concentrate only on deeper or
wider architecture design, while rarely exploring feature statistics higher
than first-order. We take a step towards addressing this problem. Our method
consists in covariance pooling, instead of the most commonly used first-order
pooling, of high-level convolutional features. The main challenges involved are
robust covariance estimation given a small sample of large-dimensional features
and usage of the manifold structure of covariance matrices. To address these
challenges, we present a Matrix Power Normalized Covariance (MPN-COV) method.
We develop forward and backward propagation formulas regarding the nonlinear

within the tangent cylinder is dominated by an off-axis plume that extends from
the inner core boundary to high latitudes and drifts westward. Earlier studies
explained the formation of such a plume in terms of the effect of a uniform
axial magnetic field that significantly increases the lengthscale of convection
in a rotating plane layer. However, rapidly rotating dynamo simulations show
that the magnetic field within the tangent cylinder has severe lateral
inhomogeneities that may influence the onset of an isolated plume. Increasing
the rotation rate in our dynamo simulations (by decreasing the Ekman number
$E$) produces progressively thinner plumes that appear to seek out the location
where the field is strongest. Motivated by this result, we examine the linear
onset of convection in a rapidly rotating fluid layer subject to a laterally
varying axial magnetic field. A cartesian geometry is chosen where the finite
dimensions $(x,z)$ mimic $(\phi,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates. The lateral
inhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a unique mode of instability where
convection is entirely confined to the peak-field region. The localization of
the flow by the magnetic field occurs even when the field strength (measured by
the Elsasser number $\varLambda$) is small and viscosity controls the smallest
lengthscale of convection. The lowest Rayleigh number at which an isolated
plume appears within the tangent cylinder in spherical shell dynamo simulations
agrees closely with the viscous-mode Rayleigh number in the plane layer linear
magnetoconvection model. The localized excitation of viscous-mode convection by
a laterally varying magnetic field provides a mechanism for the formation of
isolated plumes within Earth's tangent cylinder.

degree $k$ of $g$ satisfies $k \geq 3d/5$, unless $g$ is constant. In this

generalizing a theorem of D. Dugger from combinatorial model categories to more
general model categories. Some of these results are shown under the assumption
of Vop\v{e}nka's principle. Our main theorem applies in particular to
cofibrantly generated model categories where the domains of the generating
cofibrations satisfy a slightly stronger smallness condition. As a consequence,
assuming Vop\v{e}nka's principle, such a cofibrantly generated model category
is Quillen equivalent to a combinatorial model category. Moreover, if there are
generating sets which consist of presentable objects, then the same conclusion
holds without the assumption of Vop\v{e}nka's principle. We also correct a
mistake from previous work that made similar claims.

a hybrid scheme where quantum fluctuations affect only the monopole term

  State Information",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The capacity of the semi-deterministic relay channel (SD-RC) with non-causal
channel state information (CSI) only at the encoder and decoder is
characterized. The capacity is achieved by a scheme based on
cooperative-bin-forward. This scheme allows cooperation between the transmitter
and the relay without the need to decode a part of the message by the relay.
The transmission is divided into blocks and each deterministic output of the
channel (observed by the relay) is mapped to a bin. The bin index is used by
the encoder and the relay to choose the cooperation codeword in the next
transmission block. In causal settings the cooperation is independent of the
state. In \emph{non-causal} settings dependency between the relay's
transmission and the state can increase the transmission rates. The encoder
implicitly conveys partial state information to the relay. In particular, it
uses the states of the next block and selects a cooperation codeword
accordingly and the relay transmission depends on the cooperation codeword and
therefore also on the states. We also consider the multiple access channel with
partial cribbing as a semi-deterministic channel. The capacity region of this
channel with non-causal CSI is achieved by the new scheme. Examining the result
in several cases, we introduce a new problem of a point-to-point (PTP) channel
where the state is provided to the transmitter by a state encoder.
Interestingly, even though the CSI is also available at the receiver, we
provide an example which shows that the capacity with non-causal CSI at the
state encoder is strictly larger than the capacity with causal CSI.

randomized due to the global entanglement that ""hides"" initially localized
quantum information. In this work, we lay the mathematical foundations of
studying randomness complexities beyond scrambling by entanglement properties.
We do so by analyzing the generalized (in particular R\'enyi) entanglement
entropies of designs, i.e. ensembles of unitary channels or pure states that
mimic the uniformly random distribution (given by the Haar measure) up to
certain moments. A main collective conclusion is that the R\'enyi entanglement
entropies averaged over designs of the same order are almost maximal. This
links the orders of entropy and design, and therefore suggests R\'enyi
entanglement entropies as diagnostics of the randomness complexity of
corresponding designs. Such complexities form a hierarchy between information
scrambling and Haar randomness. As a strong separation result, we prove the
existence of (state) 2-designs such that the R\'enyi entanglement entropies of
higher orders can be bounded away from the maximum. However, we also show that
the min entanglement entropy is maximized by designs of order only logarithmic
in the dimension of the system. In other words, logarithmic-designs already
achieve the complexity of Haar in terms of entanglement, which we also call
max-scrambling. This result leads to a generalization of the fast scrambling
conjecture, that max-scrambling can be achieved by physical dynamics in time
roughly linear in the number of degrees of freedom.

to estimate the parameters in a GxE model, where G is a weighted sum of genetic
variants (genetic score) and E is a weighted sum of environments (environmental
score). The approach uses alternating optimization to estimate the parameters
of the GxE model. This is an iterative process where the genetic score weights,
the environmental score weights, and the main model parameters are estimated in
turn assuming the other parameters to be constant. This technique can be used
to construct relatively complex interaction models that are constrained to a
particular structure, and hence contain fewer parameters.
  We present the model as a two-way interaction longitudinal mixed model, for
which ordinary linear regression is a special case, but it can easily be
extended to be compatible with k-way interaction models and generalized linear
mixed models. The model is implemented in R (LEGIT package) and using SAS
macros (LEGIT_SAS). Here we present examples from the Maternal Adversity,

resulting noise-deconvolved color--magnitude diagram can be useful for a range
of applications, we focus on deriving improved stellar distance estimates
relying on both parallax and photometric information. We demonstrate the
efficiency of this approach on the 1.4 million stars of the Gaia TGAS sample
that also have APASS magnitudes. Our hierarchical model has 4~million
parameters in total, most of which are marginalized out numerically or
analytically. We find that distance estimates are significantly improved for
the noisiest parallaxes and densest regions of the color--magnitude diagram. In
particular, the average distance signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty improve
by 19~percent and 36~percent, respectively, with 8~percent of the objects
improving in SNR by a factor greater than 2. This computationally efficient
approach fully accounts for both parallax and photometric noise, and is a first
step towards a full hierarchical probabilistic model of the Gaia data.

software artefacts and model transformations act on them automating complex
tasks of the development process. It is, thus, crucially important to provide
pragmatic, reliable methods to verify that model transformations guarantee the
correctness of generated models in order to ensure the quality of the final end
product. In this paper, we build on an object-oriented algebraic encoding of
metamodels and models as defined in the standard Meta-Object Facility and in
tools, such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework, to specify a domain-specific
language for representing the action part of model transformations. We
introduce the big-step operational structural semantics of this language and
its type system, which includes a notion of polymorphic model subtyping,
showing that well-typed model transformations are well behaved. That is, that
metamodel-conformant model transformations never go wrong.

(CNN) for various problems both in low and high level visions. Especially
noteworthy is the residual network which was originally proposed to handle
high-level vision problems and enjoys several merits. This paper aims to extend
the merits of residual network, such as skip connection induced fast training,
for a typical low-level vision problem, i.e., single image super-resolution. In
general, the two main challenges of existing deep CNN for supper-resolution lie
in the gradient exploding/vanishing problem and large numbers of parameters or
computational cost as CNN goes deeper. Correspondingly, the skip connections or
identity mapping shortcuts are utilized to avoid gradient exploding/vanishing
problem. In addition, the skip connections have naturally centered the
activation which led to better performance. To tackle with the second problem,
a lightweight CNN architecture which has carefully designed width, depth and
skip connections was proposed. In particular, a strategy of gradually varying
the shape of network has been proposed for residual network. Different residual
architectures for image super-resolution have also been compared. Experimental
results have demonstrated that the proposed CNN model can not only achieve
state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM results for single image super-resolution but
also produce visually pleasant results. This paper has extended the mmm 2017

orbit determination of satellites in low orbits with radar observations. This
method is an improvement of the one described in (Gronchi et al 2015), which
uses a pure Keplerian dynamical model. Since the effect of the Earth oblateness
is strong at low altitudes, its inclusion in the model can sensibly improve the
initial orbit, giving a better starting guess for differential corrections and
increasing the chances to obtain their convergence. The input set consists of
two tracks of radar observations, each one composed of at least 4 observations
taken during the same pass of the satellite. A single observation gives the
topocentric position of the satellite, where the range is very accurate, while
the line of sight direction is poorly determined. From these data we can
compute by a polynomial fit the values of the range and range rate at the mean
epochs of the two tracks. In order to obtain a preliminary orbit we wish to
compute the angular velocities, that is the rate of change of the line of
sight. In the same spirit of (Gronchi et al 2015), we also wish to correct the
values of the angular measurements, so that they fit the selected dynamical
model if the same holds for the radial distance and velocity. The selected
model is a perturbed Keplerian dynamics, where the only perturbation included
is the secular effect of the $J_2$ term of the geopotential. The proposed
algorithm models this problem with 8 equations in 8 unknowns.

The question of passivity/activity belongs to physics thus we incorporate

passivity/activity. As a consequence, the claim that the present memristor

lensing/banding from the growth of pore ice, determined by the critical
curvature undercooling instead of the critical fracture of frozen fringe. It is
also proposed that the packing status of the porous structure in the particle

energetic and thermodynamic structure. An energy function $\varphi(x)$ emerges
as the limit of the generalized, nonequilibrium free energy of a Markovian

orthogonal field $\gamma(x)\perp\nabla\varphi$, a general vector field $b(x)$
can be decomposed into $-D(x)\nabla\varphi+\gamma$, where
$\nabla\cdot\big(\omega(x)\gamma(x)\big)=$ $-\nabla\omega D(x)\nabla\varphi$.
The matrix $D(x)$ and scalar $\omega(x)$, two additional characteristics to the
$b(x)$ alone, represent the local geometry and density of states intrinsic to
the statistical motion in the state space at $x$. $\varphi(x)$ and $\omega(x)$
are interpreted as the emergent energy and degeneracy of the motion, with an
energy balance equation $d\varphi(x(t))/dt=\gamma D^{-1}\gamma-bD^{-1}b$,
reflecting the geometrical $\|D\nabla\varphi\|^2+\|\gamma\|^2=\|b\|^2$. The
partition function employed in statistical mechanics and J. W. Gibbs' method of
