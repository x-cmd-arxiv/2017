equivalence of locally compact, second countable groups. We show that two
unimodular, locally compact, second countable groups are measure equivalent if
and only if they admit free, ergodic, probability measure preserving actions
whose cross section equivalence relations are stably orbit equivalent. Using
this we prove that in the presence of amenability any two such groups are
measure equivalent and that both amenability and property (T) are preserved
under measure equivalence, extending results of Connes-Feldman-Weiss and
Furman. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of uniform measure equivalence for
unimodular, locally compact, second countable groups, and prove that under the
additional assumption of amenability this notion coincides with coarse
equivalence, generalizing results of Shalom and Sauer. Throughout the article
we rigorously treat measure theoretic issues arising in the setting of
non-discrete groups.

variable warm DQ white dwarf OW J175358.85-310728.9 (OW J1753-3107). OW
J1753-3107 is the brightest of any of the currently known warm or hot DQ and
was discovered in the OmegaWhite Survey as exhibiting optical variations on a
period of 35.5452 (2) mins, with no evidence for other periods in its light
curves. This period has remained constant over the last two years and a
single-period sinusoidal model provides a good fit for all follow-up light
curves. The spectrum consists of a very blue continuum with strong absorption
lines of neutral and ionised carbon, a broad He I 4471 A line, and possibly
weaker hydrogen lines. The C I lines are Zeeman split, and indicate the
presence of a strong magnetic field. Using spectral Paschen-Back model
descriptions, we determine that OW J1753-3107 exhibits the following physical
parameters: T_eff = 15430 K, log(g) = 9.0, log(N(C)/N(He)) = -1.2, and the mean
magnetic field strength is B_z =2.1 MG. This relatively low temperature and
carbon abundance (compared to the expected properties of hot DQs) is similar to
that seen in the other warm DQ SDSS J1036+6522. Although OW J1753-3107 appears
to be a twin of SDSS J1036+6522, it exhibits a modulation on a period slightly
longer than the dominant period in SDSS J1036+6522 and has a higher carbon
abundance. The source of variations is uncertain, but they are believed to
originate from the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf.

This is accomplished by injecting random noise into the encoder's interactions

presented at various densities and temperatures for second neighbor hopping t',
with signs that are negative or positive corresponding to hole or electron
doping. The calculation employs a closed set of equations for the Greens
functions obtained from the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory. These
equations, when used in $d=\infty$ reproduce most of the known low energies
features of the $U=\infty$ Hubbard model. In 2-dimensions we are able to study
the variations due to the superexchange J. The resulting Dyson self energy is
found to be momentum dependent as expected. The density and temperature
dependent quasiparticle weight, decay rate and the peak spectral heights over
the Brillouin zone are calculated. We also calculate the resistivity, Hall
conductivity and cotangent of the Hall angle in experimentally relevant units.
These display significant thermal sensitivity for density n >~ 0.8, signifying
an effective Fermi-liquid temperature scale which is two or three orders of
magnitude below the bare bandwidth. Flipping the sign of the hopping t', i.e.
studying hole versus electron doping, is found to induce a change in curvature
of the temperature dependent resistivity from convex to concave at low
temperatures. Our results provide a natural route for understanding the
observed difference in the temperature dependent resistivity of strongly
correlated electron-doped and hole-doped matter.

output incomplete musical scores. Based on observations that the pitch context

construct a context-tree model that provides prior distributions of note values
using these features and combine it with a performance model in the framework
of Markov random fields. Evaluation results show that our method reduces the
average error rate by around 40 percent compared to existing/simple methods. We
also confirmed that, in our model, the score model plays a more important role
than the performance model, and it automatically captures the voice structure

the problem of fair and efficient allocation of goods [Foley'67, Varian'74].
Every agent receives an equal budget of artificial currency with which to
purchase goods, and prices match demand and supply. However, a CEEI is not
guaranteed to exist when the goods are indivisible, even in the simple
two-agent, single-item market. Yet, it is easy to see that once the two budgets
are slightly perturbed (made generic), a competitive equilibrium does exist.
  In this paper we aim to extend this approach beyond the single-item case, and
study the existence of equilibria in markets with two agents and additive
preferences over multiple items. We show that for agents with equal budgets,
making the budgets generic -- by adding vanishingly small random perturbations
-- ensures the existence of an equilibrium. We further consider agents with
arbitrary non-equal budgets, representing non-equal entitlements for goods. We
show that competitive equilibrium guarantees a new notion of fairness among
non-equal agents, and that it exists in cases of interest (like when the agents
have identical preferences) if budgets are perturbed. Our results open
opportunities for future research on generic equilibrium existence and fair
treatment of non-equals.

We carry out relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations to study the
effects of this magnetic field on the evolution of the plasma and on resulting
flow fluctuations in the ideal RMHD limit. Our results show that magnetic field
leads to enhancement in elliptic flow for small impact parameters while it
suppresses it for large impact parameters (which may provide a signal for

localized regions can temporarily increase in time as evolving plasma energy
density fluctuations lead to reorganization of magnetic flux. This can have
important effects on chiral magnetic effect. Magnetic field has non-trivial
effects on the power spectrum of flow fluctuations. For very strong magnetic
field case one sees a pattern of even-odd difference in the power spectrum of
flow coefficients arising from reflection symmetry about the magnetic field
direction if initial state fluctuations are not dominant. We discuss the

  nonnegative scalar curvature","Introduction revised, references updated, 43 pages",,,,"math.DG gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary having positive mean
curvature, a fundamental result of Shi and Tam states that, if the manifold has
nonnegative scalar curvature and if the boundary is isometric to a strictly
convex hypersurface in the Euclidean space, then the total mean curvature of
the boundary is no greater than the total mean curvature of the corresponding
Euclidean hypersurface. In $3$-dimension, Shi-Tam's result is known to be
equivalent to the Riemannian positive mass theorem.
  In this paper, we provide a supplement to Shi-Tam's result by including the
effect of minimal hypersurfaces on the boundary. More precisely, given a
compact manifold $\Omega$ with nonnegative scalar curvature, assuming its
boundary consists of two parts, $\Sigma_h$ and $\Sigma_o$, where $\Sigma_h$ is
the union of all closed minimal hypersurfaces in $\Omega$ and $\Sigma_o$ is
isometric to a suitable $2$-convex hypersurface $\Sigma$ in a spatial
Schwarzschild manifold of positive mass $m$, we establish an inequality
relating $m$, the area of $\Sigma_h$, and two weighted total mean curvatures of
$\Sigma_o$ and $ \Sigma$. In $3$-dimension, the inequality has implications to
both isometric embedding and quasi-local mass problems. In a relativistic
context, our result can be interpreted as a quasi-local mass type quantity of $
\Sigma_o$ being greater than or equal to the Hawking mass of $\Sigma_h$. We
further analyze the limit of such quasi-local mass quantity associated with
suitably chosen isometric embeddings of large coordinate spheres of an
asymptotically flat $3$-manifold $M$ into a spatial Schwarzschild manifold. We
show that the limit equals the ADM mass of $M$. It follows that our result on
the compact manifold $\Omega$ is equivalent to the Riemannian Penrose
inequality.

Furthermore, our five detected targets show evidence for hard X-ray spectral
shapes with a stacked effective power-law photon index of $\Gamma_{\rm

absorption ($N_{\rm H}\approx 2 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) in RSBAL quasars,
likely by the shielding gas found to be common in BAL quasars more generally.
We use these X-ray measurements to assess models for the nature of RSBAL
quasars, finding that a rotationally-dominated outflow model is favored while
an infall model also remains plausible with some stipulations. The X-ray data
disfavor a binary quasar model for RSBAL quasars in general.

diagram for the thermal glass and athermal jamming transitions. This diagram
makes clear that, while related, the mode-coupling---or dynamic---glass
transition is distinct from the jamming transition, occurring at a finite
temperature and significantly lower density than the jamming transition.
Nonetheless, we demonstrate a pre-jamming transition in athermal frictionless
spheres which occurs at the same density as the mode-coupling transition and is
marked by percolating clusters of locally rigid particles. At this density in
both the thermal and athermal systems, individual motions of an extensive
number of particles become constrained, such that only collective motion is
possible. This transition, which is well below jamming, exactly matches the
definition of collective behavior at the dynamical transition of glasses. Thus,
we reveal that the genesis of rigidity in both thermal and athermal systems is
governed by the same underlying topological transition in their shared
configuration space.

describing the contagion must remain static over time. Instead, our proposed
model prescribes that the degree of contagion (or productivity) changes as a
function of the conditional intensity; of particular interest is the special
case where the productivity is inversely proportional to the conditional
intensity. The model incorporates the premise that when the disease occurs at
very low frequency in the population, such as in the primary stages of an
outbreak, then anyone with the disease is likely to have a high rate of
transmission to others, whereas when the disease is prevalent in the
population, then the transmission rate is lower due to human mitigation actions
and prevention measures and a relatively high percentage of previous exposure
in the total population. The model is said to be recursive, in the sense that
the conditional intensity at any particular time depends on the productivity
associated with previous points, and this productivity in turn depends on the
conditional intensity at those points. Some basic properties of the model are
derived, estimation and simulation are discussed, and the recursive model is

years and have been selected as a coding scheme for the next generation of
mobile broadband standard. Among decoding schemes, successive-cancellation list
(SCL) decoding provides a reasonable trade-off between the error-correction
performance and hardware implementation complexity when used to decode polar
codes, at the cost of limited throughput. The simplified SCL (SSCL) and its
extension SSCL-SPC increase the speed of decoding by removing redundant
calculations when encountering particular information and frozen bit patterns
(rate one and single parity check codes), while keeping the error-correction
performance unaltered. In this paper, we improve SSCL and SSCL-SPC by proving
that the list size imposes a specific number of bit estimations required to
decode rate one and single parity check codes. Thus, the number of estimations
can be limited while guaranteeing exactly the same error-correction performance
as if all bits of the code were estimated. We call the new decoding algorithms
Fast-SSCL and Fast-SSCL-SPC. Moreover, we show that the number of bit
estimations in a practical application can be tuned to achieve desirable speed,
while keeping the error-correction performance almost unchanged. Hardware
architectures implementing both algorithms are then described and implemented:
it is shown that our design can achieve 1.86 Gb/s throughput, higher than the
best state-of-the-art decoders.

difference between the direct and reflected emission, but is alternatively
suggested to arise from the direct and scattering emission from distant clouds.
By analysing the archival Suzaku observations totalling an exposure time of ~
770 ks, we discover a soft lag of $10\pm3.4$ ks at $9.58\times10^{-6}$ Hz in
the luminous quasar PDS 456, which is the longest soft lag and lowest Fourier
frequency reported to date. In this study, we use the maximum likelihood method
to deal with non-continuous nature of the Suzaku light curves. The result
follows the mass-scaling relation for soft lags, which further supports that
soft lags originate from the innermost areas of AGN and hence are best
interpreted by the reflection scenario. Spectral analysis has been performed in
this work and we find no evidence of clumpy partial-covering absorbers. The
spectrum can be explained by a self-consistent relativistic reflection model
with warm absorbers, and spectral variations over epochs can be accounted for
by the change of the continuum, and of column density and ionization states of

combined with an airfoil undergoing pitch oscillations about its leading-edge.
The scaling trends of the time-averaged thrust forces are shown to be predicted
accurately by Garrick's theory. However, the scaling of the time-averaged power
for finite amplitude motions is shown to deviate from the theory. Novel
time-averaged power scalings are presented that account for a contribution from
added-mass forces, from the large-amplitude separating shear layer at the
trailing-edge, and from the proximity of the trailing-edge vortex. Scaling laws
for the self-propelled speed, efficiency and cost of transport ($CoT$) are
subsequently derived. Using these scaling relations the self-propelled metrics
can be predicted to within 5% of their full-scale values by using parameters
known a priori. The relations may be used to drastically speed-up the design
phase of bio-inspired propulsion systems by offering a direct link between
design parameters and the expected $CoT$. The scaling relations also offer one
of the first mechanistic rationales for the scaling of the energetics of
self-propelled swimming. Specifically, the cost of transport is shown to scale
predominately with the added mass power. This suggests that the $CoT$ of
organisms or vehicles using unsteady propulsion will scale with their mass as
$CoT \propto m^{-1/3}$, which is indeed shown to be consistent with existing
biological data.

its properties is usually performed in the Lagrangian framework, which makes
issues like the counting of its dynamical degrees of freedom less clear-cut.
Here we perform a Hamiltonian analysis of the theory. We show that the
homogeneous limit with local degrees of freedom has singular behavior in the

exploit channel sparsity for adaptively estimating multipath channel parameters

nonlinearities that overtake both Raman or Kerr nonlinearities in practically
all solids. In this paper, we show that the strength and character of Brillouin
interactions are radically altered at low temperatures when the phonon
coherence length surpasses the system size. In this limit, the solid becomes a
coherent optomechanical system with macroscopic (cm-scale) phonon modes
possessing large ($60\ \mu \rm{g}$) motional masses. These phonon modes, which
are formed by shaping the surfaces of the crystal into a confocal phononic
resonator, yield appreciable optomechanical coupling rates (${\sim}100$ Hz),
providing access to ultra-high $Q$-factor ($4.2{\times}10^7$) phonon modes at

precision and complexity for designing stable structures of well-controllable
quantum systems. It is a challenging task to find a suitable elementary
building block, of which a quantum network can be comprised in a scalable way.
Here we present the working principle of such a basic unit, engineered using
molecular chemistry, whose control and readout are executed using a nitrogen
vacancy (NV) center in diamond. The basic unit we investigate is a synthetic
polyproline with electron spins localized on attached molecular sidegroups
separated by a few nanometers. We demonstrate the readout and coherent
manipulation of very few ($\leq 6 $) of these $S=1/2$ electronic spin systems
and access their direct dipolar coupling tensor. Our results show, that it is
feasible to use spin-labeled peptides as a resource for a molecular-qubit based
network, while at the same time providing simple optical readout of single
quantum states through NV-magnetometry. This work lays the foundation for
building arbitrary quantum networks using well-established chemistry methods,
which has many applications ranging from mapping distances in single molecules
to quantum information processing.

electron beams by laser-plasma sources is the utilization of plasma channels
generated by the capillary discharges. These channels, i.e., plasma columns
with a minimum density along the laser pulse propagation axis, may optically
guide short laser pulses, thereby increasing the acceleration length, leading
to a more efficient electron acceleration. Although the spatial structure of
the installation is simple in principle, there may be some important effects
caused by the open ends of the capillary, by the supplying channels etc., which
require a detailed 3D modeling of the processes taking place in order to get a
detailed understanding and improve the operation. However, the discharge
plasma, being one of the most crucial components of the laser-plasma
accelerator, is not simulated with the accuracy and resolution required to
advance this promising technology. In the present work, such simulations are
performed using the code MARPLE. First, the process of the capillary filling
with a cold hydrogen before the discharge is fired, through the side supply
channels is simulated. The main goal of this simulation is to get a spatial
distribution of the filling gas in the region near the open ends of the
capillary. A realistic geometry is used for this and the next stage
simulations, including the insulators, the supplying channels as well as the
electrodes. Second, the simulation of the capillary discharge is performed with
the goal to obtain a time-dependent spatial distribution of the electron
density near the open ends of the capillary as well as inside the capillary.
Finally, to evaluate effectiveness of the beam coupling with the channeling
plasma wave guide and electron acceleration, modeling of laser-plasma

connections or citizenship of users in a social network via edge and node
sampling is a vital part of the study of complex networks. Due to its low cost,
sampling via a random walk (RW) has been proposed as an attractive solution to
this task. Most RW methods assume either that the network is undirected or that
walkers can traverse edges regardless of their direction. Some RW methods have
been designed for directed networks where edges coming into a node are not
directly observable. In this work, we propose Directed Unbiased Frontier
Sampling (DUFS), a sampling method based on a large number of coordinated
walkers, each starting from a node chosen uniformly at random. It is applicable
to directed networks with invisible incoming edges because it constructs, in
real-time, an undirected graph consistent with the walkers trajectories, and
due to the use of random jumps which prevent walkers from being trapped. DUFS
generalizes previous RW methods and is suited for undirected networks and to
directed networks regardless of in-edges visibility. We also propose an
improved estimator of node label distributions that combines information from
the initial walker locations with subsequent RW observations. We evaluate DUFS,
compare it to other RW methods, investigate the impact of its parameters on
estimation accuracy and provide practical guidelines for choosing them. In
estimating out-degree distributions, DUFS yields significantly better estimates
of the head of the distribution than other methods, while matching or exceeding
estimation accuracy of the tail. Last, we show that DUFS outperforms uniform
node sampling when estimating distributions of node labels of the top 10%
largest degree nodes, even when sampling a node uniformly has the same cost as
RW steps.

standard multiple target tracking (MTT) algorithms with only kinematic
measurements. However, in many applications, the feature signal of the targets
consists of sparse Fourier-domain signals. It changes quickly and nonlinearly
in the time domain, and the feature measurements are corrupted by missed
detections and mis-associations. These two factors make it hard to extract the
feature information to be used in MTT. In this paper, we develop a
feature-aided nearest neighbour joint probabilistic data association filter
(NN-JPDAF) for joint MTT and feature extraction in dense target environments.
To estimate the rapidly varying feature signal from incomplete and corrupted
measurements, we use the atomic norm constraint to formulate the sparsity of
feature signal and use the $\ell_1$-norm to formulate the sparsity of the
corruption induced by mis-associations. Based on the sparse representation, the
feature signal are estimated by solving a semidefinite program (SDP) which is
convex. We also provide an iterative method for solving this SDP via the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration
involves closed-form computation. With the estimated feature signal,
re-filtering is performed to estimate the kinematic states of the targets,
where the association makes use of both kinematic and feature information.
Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithm in a radar application.

fast calculations of biological and bio-inspired self-propelled locomotion. The
approach uniquely combines an unsteady three-dimensional boundary element
method, a boundary layer solver and self-propelled equations of motion. This
novel implementation allows for the self-propelled speed, power, efficiency and
economy to be accurately calculated. A Dirichlet formulation is used with a
combination of constant strength source and doublet elements to represent a
deforming body with a nonlinearly deforming wake. The wake elements are
desingularized to numerically stabilize the evolution of the wake vorticity.
Weak coupling is used in solving the equations of motion and in the boundary
layer solution. The boundary layer solver models both laminar and turbulent
behavior along the deforming body to estimate the total skin friction drag
acting on the body. The results from the method are validated with analytical
solutions, computations and experiments. Finally, a bio-inspired self-propelled
undulatory fin is modeled. The computed self-propelled speeds and wake
structures agree well with previous experiments. The computations go beyond the
experiments to gain further insight into the propulsive efficiency for
self-propelled undulating fins. It is found that the undulating fin produces a
time-averaged momentum jet at 76% of the span that accelerates fluid in the
streamwise direction and in turn generates thrust. Additionally, it is
discovered that high amplitude motions suppress the formation of a bifurcating
momentum jet and instead form a single core jet. Consequently, this maximizes
the amount of streamwise momentum compared to the amount of wasted lateral
momentum and leads to a propulsive efficiency of 78% during self-propelled
locomotion.

guaranteed to converge to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the
nonconvex SymNMF problem. Furthermore, it achieves a global sublinear
convergence rate. We also show that the algorithm can be efficiently
implemented in parallel. Further, sufficient conditions are provided which
guarantee the global and local optimality of the obtained solutions. Extensive
numerical results performed on both synthetic and real data sets suggest that
the proposed algorithm converges quickly to a local minimum solution.

content of an optically-selected spectroscopic sample of galaxies through
cross-correlation with HI intensity mapping measurements. We show that the
HI-galaxy cross-power spectrum contains an additive shot noise term which
scales with the average HI brightness temperature of the optically-selected
galaxies, allowing constraints to be placed on the average HI mass per galaxy.
This approach can estimate the HI content of populations too faint to directly
observe through their 21cm emission over a wide range of redshifts. This
cross-correlation, as a function of optical luminosity or colour, can be used
to derive HI-scaling relations. We demonstrate that this signal will be
detectable by cross-correlating upcoming Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)
observations with existing optically-selected samples. We also use
semi-analytic simulations to verify that the HI mass can be successfully
recovered by our technique in the range M_HI > 10^8 M_solar, in a manner
independent of the underlying power spectrum shape. We conclude that this
method is a powerful tool to study galaxy evolution, which only requires a
single intensity mapping dataset to infer complementary HI gas information from
existing optical and infra-red observations.

less active with increasing $N$, and that these nuclear reactions are excited
by spurious heating due to low resolution. Moreover, we find no shock wave
generation. In order to investigate the reason for the absence of a shock wave,
we additionally perform 1 dimensional (1D) SPH and mesh-based simulations with
a space resolution ranging from $10^4$ to $10^7$ cm, using characteristic flow
structure extracted from the 3D SPH simulations. We find shock waves in these
1D high-resolution simulations. One of these shock waves triggers a detonation
wave. However, we have to be careful of the fact that, if the shock wave
emerged at a bit outer region, it could not trigger the detonation wave due to
low density. Note that the 1D initial conditions lack accuracy to precisely
determine where a shock wave emerges. We need to perform 3D simulations with

such as Spark, Tez, and Piccolo. However, prevalent systems employ rather
simple cache management policies--notably the Least Recently Used (LRU)
policy--that are oblivious to the application semantics of data dependency,
expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Without this knowledge, memory
caching can at best be performed by ""guessing"" the future data access patterns
based on historical information (e.g., the access recency and/or frequency),
which frequently results in inefficient, erroneous caching with low hit ratio
and a long response time. In this paper, we propose a novel cache replacement
policy, Least Reference Count (LRC), which exploits the application-specific
DAG information to optimize the cache management. LRC evicts the cached data
blocks whose reference count is the smallest. The reference count is defined,
for each data block, as the number of dependent child blocks that have not been

analysis and cluster deployments against popular benchmarking workloads. Our
Spark implementation shows that, compared with LRU, LRC speeds up typical

approach the problem of mortality modelling with cohort factors incorporated
through a novel formulation under a state-space methodology. In the process we
demonstrate that cohort factors can be formulated naturally under the
state-space framework, despite the fact that cohort factors are indexed
according to year-of-birth rather than year. Bayesian inference for cohort
models in a state-space formulation is then developed based on an efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, allowing for the quantification of parameter
uncertainty in cohort models and resulting mortality forecasts that are used
for life expectancy and life table constructions. The effectiveness of our
approach is examined through comprehensive empirical studies involving male and
female populations from various countries. Our results show that cohort
patterns are present for certain countries that we studied and the inclusion of
cohort factors are crucial in capturing these phenomena, thus highlighting the
benefits of introducing cohort models in the state-space framework. Forecasting
of cohort models is also discussed in light of the projection of cohort
factors.

network and one-step post processing. The fully convolutional network is
optimized in an end-to-end way and has bi-task outputs where one is pixel-wise
classification between text and non-text, and the other is direct regression to
determine the vertex coordinates of quadrilateral text boundaries. The proposed
method is particularly beneficial for localizing incidental scene texts. On the
ICDAR2015 Incidental Scene Text benchmark, our method achieves the F1-measure
of 81%, which is a new state-of-the-art and significantly outperforms previous
approaches. On other standard datasets with focused scene texts, our method
also reaches the state-of-the-art performance.

nonlocal Poisson-Fermi results to Poisson-Boltzmann calculations in electric

options can greatly reduce the sample complexity of reinforcement learning, but
manually designing options is infeasible in high-dimensional and abstract state

discovery, they do not scale to multi-level hierarchies and to expressive
representations such as deep networks. We present Discovery of Deep Options
(DDO), a policy-gradient algorithm that discovers parametrized options from a
set of demonstration trajectories, and can be used recursively to discover
additional levels of the hierarchy. The scalability of our approach to
multi-level hierarchies stems from the decoupling of low-level option discovery
from high-level meta-control policy learning, facilitated by
under-parametrization of the high level. We demonstrate that using the
discovered options to augment the action space of Deep Q-Network agents can
accelerate learning by guiding exploration in tasks where random actions are
unlikely to reach valuable states. We show that DDO is effective in adding
options that accelerate learning in 4 out of 5 Atari RAM environments chosen in

the security of a cryptosystem depends on the security of a block cipher. A
Feistel network is the most widely used method to construct a block cipher.
This structure has a property such that it can transform a function to a
bijective function. But the previous Feistel network is unsuitable to construct
block ciphers that have large input-output size. One way to construct block
ciphers with large input-output size is to use an unbalanced Feistel network
that is the generalization of a previous Feistel network. There have been
little research on unbalanced Feistel networks and previous work was about some
particular structures of unbalanced Feistel networks. So previous work didn't
provide a theoretical base to construct block ciphers that are secure and
efficient using unbalanced Feistel networks.
  In this thesis, we analyze the minimal number of rounds of pseudo-random
permutation generators that use unbalanced Feistel networks. That is, after
categorizing unbalanced Feistel networks as source-heavy structures and
target-heavy structures, we analyze the minimal number of rounds of
pseudo-random permutation generators that use each structure. Therefore, in
order to construct a block cipher that is secure and efficient using unbalanced
Feistel networks, we should follow the results of this thesis. Additionally, we
propose a new unbalanced Feistel network that has some advantages such that it
can extend a previous block cipher with small input-output size to a new block
cipher with large input-output size. We also analyze the minimum number of
rounds of a pseudo-random permutation generator that uses this structure.

the two-point correlation function of the non-minimally coupled scalar fields
and constructing the effective potential with the adiabatic (WKB)
regularization or approximation. First, we clearly show that the cut-off
divergence of the quantum fluctuations does not drastically change during
inflation under reasonable assumptions and the corrections can be embedded in
standard effective potential. Thus, the UV effects on the primordial density
perturbation are well translated into the effective potential. Then, we find
out the modified effective potential from the inflationary fluctuations and
show how the trans-Planckian or UV corrections change the potential during
inflation. We clearly show that the new physics strongly affects the inflation
potential during inflation and we obtain a inflationary constraint
$\Lambda_{\rm UV} \ll H/g^{1/2}$ where $g$ is the interaction coupling at the

recent years. While the stabilizability and optimal control of NCS for a given
communication system has already been studied extensively, the design of the
communication system for NCS has recently seen an increase in more thorough
investigation. In this paper, we address an optimal scheduling problem for a
set of NCS sharing a dedicated communication channel, providing performance
bounds and asymptotic stability. We derive a suboptimal scheduling policy with
dynamic state-based priorities calculated at the sensors, which are then used
for stateless priority queuing in the network, making it both scalable and
efficient to implement on routers or multi-layer switches. These properties are
beneficial towards leveraging existing IP networks for control, which will be a
crucial factor for the proliferation of wide-area NCS applications. By allowing
for an arbitrary number of concurrent transmissions, we are able to investigate
the relationship between available bandwidth, transmission rate, and delay. To
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide a proof-of-concept
implementation of the priority scheduler using real networking hardware.

As erasure codes emerge as a popular technique to achieve high data reliability

still remains an open problem due to the lack of mathematical models for
analyzing such systems. To this end, we propose a framework for quantifying and
optimizing tail latency in erasure-coded storage systems. In particular, we
derive upper bounds on tail latency in closed form for arbitrary service time

optimization problem to jointly minimize the weighted latency tail probability
of all files over the placement of files on the servers, and the choice of

an efficient, alternating optimization algorithm. Numerical results show
significant reduction of tail latency for erasure-coded storage systems with a

quantum suppression of classical diffusion in systems that are classically
chaotic. Another kind of Anderson localization has been recently proposed, i.e.
localization in the time domain due to the presence of {\it disorder} in time.
That is, the probability density for the detection of a system at a fixed
position in the configuration space is localized exponentially around a certain
moment of time if a system is driven by a force that fluctuates in time. We
show that an electron in a Rydberg atom, perturbed by a fluctuating microwave

realized in some trinuclear organometallic complexes. Localized $S=1$ moments
with a single-spin anisotropy emerge from the interplay of Coulomb repulsion
and spin molecular-orbit coupling (SMOC). Magnetic anisotropies with bond
dependent exchange couplings occur in the honeycomb layers when the direct
intracluster exchange and the spin molecular-orbital coupling are both present.
We find that the effective spin exchange model within the layers is an XXZ +
120$^\circ$ honeycomb quantum compass model. The intrinsic non-spherical
symmetry of the multinuclear complexes leads to very different transverse and
longitudinal spin molecular-orbital couplings, which greatly enhances the
single-spin and exchange coupling anisotropies. The interlayer coupling is
described by a XXZ model with anisotropic biquadratic terms. As the correlation
strength increases the systems becomes increasingly one-dimensional. Thus, if
the ratio of SMOC to the interlayer hopping is small this stabilizes the
Haldane phase. However, as the ratio increases there is a quantum phase
transition to the topologically trivial `$D$-phase'. We also predict a quantum
phase transition from a Haldane phase to a magnetically ordered phase at
sufficiently strong external magnetic fields.

for ROM generation of parametric Hamiltonian systems that captures the
symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems to ensure stability of the reduced
model. Through the greedy selection of basis vectors, two new vectors are added
at each iteration to the linear vector space to increase the accuracy of the
reduced basis. We use the error in the Hamiltonian due to model reduction as an
error indicator to search the parameter space and identify the next best basis
vectors. Under natural assumptions on the set of all solutions of the
Hamiltonian system under variation of the parameters, we show that the greedy
algorithm converges with exponential rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that
combining the greedy basis with the discrete empirical interpolation method
also preserves the symplectic structure. This enables the reduction of the
computational cost for nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. The efficiency, accuracy,

profound implications for the corresponding system: it is stable against

introduce the microscopic studies on nuclear spin-isospin properties in the

that I have been joining in as examples. It is seen that the covariant scheme
plays an important role in describing the spin properties in a consistent way,
such as the spin-orbit splitting, the pseudospin symmetry, etc. Meanwhile, the
Fock terms play important roles in describing the isospin properties fully
self-consistently, such as the Gamow-Teller and spin-dipole resonances, the
isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections to nuclear superallowed $\beta$
transitions, etc. To connect the covariant DFT to more fundamental theories, an
\textit{ab initio} relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory for finite nuclei
is introduced, and a personal perspective for the coming decade is also
illustrated.

considers video streaming over erasure-coded distributed cloud systems. The
download time of each coded chunk of each video segment is characterized and
ordered statistics over the choice of the erasure-coded chunks is used to
obtain the playback time of different video segments. Using the playback times,
bounds on the moment generating function on the stall duration is used to bound
the mean stall duration. Moment generating function based bounds on the ordered
statistics are also used to bound the stall duration tail probability which
determines the probability that the stall time is greater than a pre-defined

and industrial sensing in undersea/ocean space, therefore, these networks are
also named underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Underwater sensor
networks are different from other sensor networks due to the acoustic channel
used in their physical layer, thus we should discuss about the specific
features of these underwater networks such as acoustic channel modeling and
protocol design for different layers of open system interconnection (OSI)
model. Each node of these networks as a sensor needs to exchange data with
other nodes; however, complexity of the acoustic channel makes some challenges
in practice, especially when we are designing the network protocols. Therefore
based on the mentioned cases, we are going to review general issues of the
design of a UASN in this paper. In this regard, we firstly describe the network
architecture for a typical 3D UASN, then we review the characteristics of the
acoustic channel and the corresponding challenges of it and finally, we discuss
about the different layers e.g. MAC protocols, routing protocols, and signal
processing for the application layer of UASNs.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we develop a numerical method to solve nonlinear optimal
control problems with final-state constraints. Specifically, we extend the
PRojection Operator based Netwon's method for Trajectory Optimization (PRONTO),
which was proposed by Hauser for unconstrained optimal control problems. While
in the standard method final-state constraints can be only approximately
handled by means of a terminal penalty, in this work we propose a methodology
to meet the constraints exactly. Moreover, our method guarantees recursive
feasibility of the final-state constraint. This is an appealing property
especially in realtime applications in which one would like to be able to stop
the computation even if the desired tolerance has not been reached, but still
satisfy the constraints. Following the same conceptual idea of PRONTO, the
proposed strategy is based on two main steps which (differently from the
standard scheme) preserve the feasibility of the final-state constraints: (i)
solve a quadratic approximation of the nonlinear problem to find a descent
direction, and (ii) get a (feasible) trajectory by means of a feedback law
(which turns out to be a nonlinear projection operator). To find the (feasible)
descent direction we take advantage of final-state constrained Linear Quadratic
optimal control methods, while the second step is performed by suitably
designing a constrained version of the trajectory tracking projection operator.
The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is tested on the optimal state
transfer of an inverted pendulum.

cores to pre-main-sequence (PMS) objects. Understanding the formation of
massive stars requires taking into account the accretion of angular momentum
during their PMS phase. We study the PMS evolution of objects destined to
become massive stars by accretion, focusing on the links between the physical
conditions of the environment and the rotational properties of young stars. In
particular, we look at the physical conditions that allow the production of
massive stars by accretion. We present PMS models computed with a new version
of the Geneva Stellar Evolution code self-consistently including accretion and
rotation according to various accretion scenarios for mass and angular
momentum. We describe the internal distribution of angular momentum in PMS
stars accreting at high rates and we show how the various physical conditions
impact their internal structures, evolutionary tracks, and rotation velocities
during the PMS and the early main sequence. We find that the smooth angular
momentum accretion considered in previous studies leads to an angular momentum
barrier and does not allow the formation of massive stars by accretion. A
braking mechanism is needed in order to circumvent this angular momentum
barrier. This mechanism has to be efficient enough to remove more than 2/3 of
the angular momentum from the inner accretion disc. Due to the weak efficiency
of angular momentum transport by shear instability and meridional circulation
during the accretion phase, the internal rotation profiles of accreting stars
reflect essentially the angular momentum accretion history. As a consequence,
careful choice of the angular momentum accretion history allows circumvention
of any limitation in mass and velocity, and production of stars of any mass and
velocity compatible with structure equations.

outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives by a large margin with high

of silicon's large third order nonlinearity with a process known as spontaneous
four wave mixing. These sources are capable of producing pairs of
indistinguishable photons but typically suffer from an effective $50\%$ loss.
By slightly decoupling the input waveguide from the ring, the drop port
coincidence ratio can be significantly increased with the trade-off being that
the pump is less efficiently coupled into the ring. Ring resonators with this
design have been demonstrated having coincidence ratios of $\sim 96\%$ but
requiring a factor of $\sim 10$ increase in the pump power. Through the
modification of the coupling design that relies on additional spectral
dependence, it is possible to achieve similar coincidence ratios without the
increased pumping requirement. This can be achieved by coupling the input
waveguide to the ring multiple times, thus creating a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. This coupler design can be used on both sides of the ring
resonator so that resonances supported by one of the couplers are suppressed by
the other. This is the ideal configuration for a photon-pair source as it can
only support the pump photons at the input side while only allowing the
generated photons to leave through the output side. Recently, this device has
been realized with preliminary results exhibiting the desired spectral
dependence and with a coincidence ratio as high as $\sim 97\%$ while allowing
the pump to be nearly critically coupled to the ring. The demonstrated near
unity coincidence ratio infers a near maximal heralding efficiency from the
fabricated device. This device has the potential to greatly improve the
scalability and performance of quantum computing and communication systems.

overhead and major implementation burden, or may not even be viable at all.
  Motivated by the above issues, we propose a joint auto-scaling and load
balancing scheme which does not require any global queue length information or
explicit knowledge of system parameters, and yet provides provably near-optimal
service elasticity. We establish the fluid-level dynamics for the proposed
scheme in a regime where the total traffic volume and nominal service capacity
grow large in proportion. The fluid-limit results show that the proposed scheme
achieves asymptotic optimality in terms of user-perceived delay performance as
well as energy consumption. Specifically, we prove that both the waiting time
of tasks and the relative energy portion consumed by idle servers vanish in the
limit. At the same time, the proposed scheme operates in a distributed fashion
and involves only constant communication overhead per task, thus ensuring
scalability in massive data center operations.

been observed to transition between a radio state, during which it is visible
as a millisecond radio pulsar, and and a Low Mass X-ray Binary state, during
which accretion powered X-ray pulsations are visible. Timing during the two
phases reveals that during the LMXB phase the neutron star is spinning down at
a rate of $\dot{\nu}\approx -3 \times 10^{-15}$ Hz/s, which is approximately
27\% faster than the rate measured during the radio phase, $\dot{\nu}\approx
-2.4 \times 10^{-15}$ Hz/s, and at odds with the predictions of accretion
models. In this letter we suggest that the increase in spin-down rate is
compatible with gravitational wave emission, and in particular to the creation
of a `mountain' during the accretion phase. We show that asymmetries in
pycno-nuclear reaction rates in the crust can lead to a large enough mass
quadrupole to explain the observed spin-down rate, which so far has no other
self-consistent explanation, and that radio timing at the onset of the next
millisecond radio pulsar phase can test this scenario. Another possibility is
that an unstable $r$-mode with amplitude $\alpha\approx 5\times10^{-8}$ may be
present in the system.

peak-demand minimization problems in smart grids. Here, the goal is to minimize
the peak value over a finite horizon with: (i) the demand at each time instant

states at different time instants being coupled through local dynamics. The
min-max structure and the double coupling (through the devices and over the

well-known distributed dual decomposition approaches cannot be applied). We
propose a distributed algorithm based on the combination of duality methods and
properties from min-max optimization. Specifically, we derive a series of
equivalent problems by introducing ad-hoc slack variables and by going back and
forth from primal and dual formulations. On the resulting problem we apply a
dual subgradient method, which turns out to be a distributed algorithm. We
prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm and show its effectiveness via

still remains elusive. Owing to their proximity to the massive spirals Milky
Way (MW) and M31, various environmental processes have been invoked to explain
their origin. In this context, the tidal stirring model postulates that
interactions with MW-sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs,
resembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, into systems with the
kinematic and structural properties of dSphs. Using N-body+SPH simulations, we
investigate the dependence of this transformation mechanism on the gas
fraction, fgas, in the disk of the progenitor dwarf. Our numerical experiments
incorporate for the first time the combined effects of radiative cooling,
ram-pressure stripping, star formation, supernova (SN) winds, and a cosmic UV
background. For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported
dwarfs with gas fractions akin to those of observed dIrrs (fgas >= 0.5),
demonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of
transformation into dSphs relative to their collisionless (fgas = 0)
counterparts. We argue that the combination of ram-pressure stripping and SN
winds causes the gas-rich dwarfs to respond more impulsively to tides,
augmenting their transformation. When fgas >= 0.5, disky dwarfs on previously
unfavorable low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are still able to
transform. On the widest orbits, the transformation is incomplete; the dwarfs
retain significant rotational support, a relatively flat shape, and some gas,
naturally resembling transition-type systems. We conclude that tidal stirring
constitutes a prevalent evolutionary mechanism for shaping the structure of
dwarf galaxies within the currently favored CDM cosmological paradigm.

it automatically to a utility provider (UP) in almost real time. Despite many
advantages of SMs, their use also leads to serious concerns about consumer
privacy. In this paper, SM privacy is studied by considering the presence of a
renewable energy source (RES) and a rechargeable battery (RB), which can be
used to partially hide the consumer's energy consumption behavior. Privacy is
measured by the information leakage rate, which denotes the average mutual
information between the user's real energy consumption and the energy requested
from the grid, which the SM reads and reports to the UP. The impact of the
knowledge of the amount of energy generated by the RES at the UP is also
considered. The minimum information leakage rate is characterized as a
computable information theoretic single-letter expression in the two extreme
cases, that is, when the battery capacity is infinite or zero. Numerical
results are presented for the finite battery capacity case to illustrate the
potential privacy gains from the existence of an RB. It is shown that, while
the information leakage rate decreases with increasing availability of an RES,
larger storage capacity is needed to fully exploit the available energy to
improve the privacy.

governed by the interaction between phonons and localized excitations referred
to as tunneling two level systems (TLS). The temperature variation of the
thermal conductivity of these amorphous materials is considered as universal
and is characterized by a quadratic power law. This is well described by the
phenomenological TLS model even though its microscopic explanation is still
elusive. Here, by scaling down to the nanometer scale amorphous systems much
below the bulk phonon-TLS mean free path, we probed the robustness of that
model in restricted geometry systems. Using very sensitive thermal conductance
measurements, we demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the thermal
conductance of silicon nitride nanostructures remains mostly quadratic
independently of the nanowire section. It is not following the cubic power law
in temperature as expected in a Casimir-Ziman regime of boundary limited
thermal transport. This shows a thermal transport counter intuitively dominated
by phonon-TLS interactions and not by phonon-boundary scattering in the
nanowires. This could be ascribed to an unexpected high density of TLS on the
surfaces which still dominates the phonon diffusion processes at low
temperatures and explains why the universal quadratic temperature dependence of
thermal conductance still holds for amorphous nanowires.

strongest material in nature. In the press release of the Nobel committee it is
claimed that a hammock made of a squared meter of one-atom thick graphene could
sustain the wight of a 4 kg cat. More practically important are applications of
graphene like scaffolds and sensors which are crucially dependent on the
mechanical strength. Meter-sized graphene is even being considered for the
lightsails in the starshot project to reach the star alpha centaury. The
predicted strength of graphene is based on its very large Young modulus which
is, per atomic layer, much larger than that of steel. This reasoning however
would apply to conventional thin plates but does not take into account the
peculiar properties of graphene as a thermally fluctuating crystalline
membrane. It was shown recently both experimentally and theoretically that
thermal fluctuations lead to a dramatic reduction of the Young modulus and
increase of the bending rigidity for micron-sized graphene samples in
comparison with atomic scale values. This makes the use of the standard
F\""oppl-von Karman elasticity (FvK) theory for thin plates not directly
applicable to graphene and other single atomic layer membranes. This fact is
important because the current interpretation of experimental results is based
on the FvK theory. In particular, we show that the FvK-derived Schwerin
equation, routinely used to derive the Young modulus from indentation
experiments has to be essentially modified for graphene at room temperature and
for micron sized samples. Based on scaling analysis and atomistic simulation we
investigate the mechanics of graphene under transverse load up to breaking. We
determine the limits of applicability of the FvK theory and provide
quantitative estimates for the different regimes.

$z=1.06$. The arc system is notable for the presence of a bright central image.
The source is a Lyman Break galaxy at $z_s=2.39$ and the mass enclosed within
the 14 arc second radius Einstein ring is $10^{14.2}$ solar masses. We perform
a full light profile reconstruction of the lensed images to precisely infer the
parameters of the mass distribution. The brightness of the central image
demands that the central total density profile of the lens be shallow. By
fitting the dark matter as a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile---with a
free parameter for the inner density slope---we find that the break radius is
$270^{+48}_{-76}$ kpc, and that the inner density falls with radius to the
power $-0.38\pm0.04$ at 68 percent confidence. Such a shallow profile is in
strong tension with our understanding of relaxed cold dark matter halos; dark
matter only simulations predict the inner density should fall as $r^{-1}$. The
tension can be alleviated if this cluster is in fact a merger; a two halo model
can also reconstruct the data, with both clumps (density going as $r^{-0.8}$
and $r^{-1.0}$) much more consistent with predictions from dark matter only
simulations. At the resolution of our Dark Energy Survey imaging, we are unable
to choose between these two models, but we make predictions for forthcoming
Hubble Space Telescope imaging that will decisively distinguish between them.

describe the ability of a biological system to keep its output dynamics
unchanged in the face of varying parameters. Here we show that, according to
its original definition, dynamical compensation is equivalent to lack of
structural identifiability. This is relevant if model parameters need to be
estimated, which is often the case in biological modelling. This realization
prompts us to warn that care should we taken when using an unidentifiable model
to extract biological insight: the estimated values of structurally
unidentifiable parameters are meaningless, and model predictions about
unmeasured state variables can be wrong. Taking this into account, we explore
alternative definitions of dynamical compensation that do not necessarily imply
structural unidentifiability. Accordingly, we show different ways in which a
model can be made identifiable while exhibiting dynamical compensation. Our
analyses enable the use of the new concept of dynamical compensation in the
context of parameter identification, and reconcile it with the desirable
property of structural identifiability.

approximate nature, this approach is observed to be both much faster and more
accurate than the conventional PWE method and can give a very accurate
estimation of confined propagating modes. As an application example of the
proposed method we investigate a non-reciprocal photonic device. This device is
a phoxonic slab waveguide which changes modes of optical waves by elastic waves

presenting a number of applications of non-Abelian bosonization to models with

discuss truncated spectrum methods for the numerical study of systems in one

considerable insight into the methodology by reviewing canonical applications

involves combining truncated spectrum methods with matrix product state
algorithms. We describe applications of this method to two-dimensional systems

their compactness, with neighbouring planets closer together than any in the

suggesting that such compact systems can survive for extended periods of time.
We have used numerical simulations to investigate how quickly systems go
unstable in relation to the spacing between planets, focusing on hypothetical
systems of Earth-mass planets on evenly-spaced orbits (in mutual Hill radii).
In general, the further apart the planets are initially, the longer it takes
for a pair of planets to undergo a close encounter. We recover the results of
previous studies, showing a linear trend in the initial planet spacing between
3 and 8 mutual Hill radii and the logarithm of the stability time.
Investigating thousands of simulations with spacings up to 13 mutual Hill radii
reveals distinct modulations superimposed on this relationship in the vicinity
of first and second-order mean motion resonances of adjacent and next-adjacent
planets. We discuss the impact of this structure and the implications on the

the spread of crime or terrorism data over a given region, especially when the

spatio-temporal diffusion in the process model as well as temporal diffusion,

a self-exciting spatio-temporal model to terrorism data in Iraq and demonstrate
how choice of process model leads to differing conclusions on the existence of

discontinuous model is non-Filippov, and the concept of Filippov solution
cannot be used. Furthermore some Carath\'eodory solutions are unphysical.
Therefore we introduce the concept of stiction solutions: these are the
Carath\'eodory solutions that are physically relevant, i.e. the ones that
follow the stiction law. However, we find that some of the stiction solutions
are forward non-unique in subregions of the slip onset. We call these solutions
singular, in contrast to the regular stiction solutions that are forward
unique. In order to further the understanding of the non-unique dynamics, we
introduce a regularization of the model. This gives a singularly perturbed
problem that captures the main features of the original discontinuous problem.
We identify a repelling slow manifold that separates the forward slipping to
forward sticking solutions, leading to a high sensitivity to the initial
conditions. On this slow manifold we find canard trajectories, that have the
physical interpretation of delaying the slip onset. We show with numerics that
the regularized problem has a family of periodic orbits interacting with the
canards. We observe that this family has a saddle stability and that it
connects, in the rigid body limit, the two regular, slip-stick branches of the
discontinuous problem, that were otherwise disconnected.

as an alternative to Lloyd's algorithm, which for all its ease of

local optima. While the TS approach can yield superior performance, it involves
a high computational complexity. Moreover, the difficulty in parameter
selection in the existing TS approach does not make it any more attractive.
This paper presents an alternative, low-complexity formulation of the TS
optimization procedure for K-Means clustering. This approach does not require
many parameter settings. We initially constrain the centers to points in the

structure that makes use of gradient information of the objective function.
This results in an efficient exploration of the search space, after which the

BOSS Great Wall (BGW), a recently discovered very rich supercluster complex at
the redshift $z = 0.47$. We have employed the Minkowski functionals to quantify
supercluster morphology. We calculate supercluster luminosities and masses
using two methods. Firstly, we used data about the luminosities and stellar
masses of high stellar mass galaxies with $\log(M_*/h^{-1}M_\odot) \geq 11.3$.
Secondly, we applied a scaling relation that combines morphological and
physical parameters of superclusters to obtain supercluster luminosities, and
obtained supercluster masses using the mass-to-light ratios found for local
rich superclusters. We find that the BGW superclusters are very elongated
systems, with shape parameter values of less than $0.2$. This value is lower
than that found for the most elongated local superclusters. The values of the
fourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ for the richer BGW superclusters ($V_3 = 7$
and $10$) show that they have a complicated and rich inner structure. We
identify two Planck SZ clusters in the BGW superclusters, one in the richest
BGW supercluster, and another in one of the poor BGW superclusters. The
luminosities of the BGW superclusters are in the range of $1 -
8\times~10^{13}h^{-2}L_\odot$, and masses in the range of $0.4 -
2.1\times~10^{16}h^{-1}M_\odot$. Supercluster luminosities and masses obtained
with two methods agree well. We conclude that the BGW is a complex of massive,
luminous and large superclusters with very elongated shape. The search and
detailed study, including the morphology analysis of the richest superclusters
and their complexes from observations and simulations can help us to understand
formation and evolution of the cosmic web.

the quality of the discovered regions by adversarial erasing, an online

adversarial erasing by providing auxiliary segmentation supervision modulated

  We devise SensCrypt, a protocol for secure data storage and communication,
for use by makers of affordable and lightweight personal trackers. SensCrypt
thwarts not only the attacks we introduced, but also defends against powerful
JTAG Read attacks. We have built Sens.io, an Arduino Uno based tracker
platform, of similar capabilities but at a fraction of the cost of current
solutions. On Sens.io, SensCrypt imposes a negligible write overhead and
significantly reduces the end-to-end sync overhead of Fitbit and Garmin.

using the latest observational data. To perform the analysis, we employ the
current cosmological observations, including the cosmic microwave background
temperature power spectrum data from the Planck mission, the baryon acoustic
oscillation measurements, the type Ia supernova data, the redshift space
distortion measurements, the shear data of weak lensing observation, the Planck
lensing measurement, and the latest direct measurement of $H_0$ as well. We
show that, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the holographic dark energy
cosmology with sterile neutrinos can relieve the tension between the Planck
observation and the direct measurement of $H_0$ much better. Once we include
the $H_0$ measurement in the global fit, we find that the hint of the existence
of sterile neutrinos in the holographic dark energy cosmology can be given.
Under the constraint of the all-data combination, we obtain $N_{\rm eff}=
3.76\pm0.26$ and $m_{\nu,\rm sterile}^{\rm eff}< 0.215\,\rm eV$, indicating
that the detection of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}>0$ in the holographic dark energy
cosmology is at the $2.75\sigma$ level and the massless or very light sterile
neutrino is favored by the current observations.

Here, focusing on U(Nc) SQCD with Nf flavors and N=2 supersymmetry, we show
that even when the monopole potential is irrelevant, the monopole-modified
theory Tm can exist and enjoy Seiberg-like dualities. We provide a
renormalizable UV completion of Tm and an electric-magnetic dual description

$\nu_T=1/2+1/2$ of the lowest Landau level as a function of layer distances

distinct phases, including an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous
interlayer coherence at small $d$, a composite Fermi liquid at large $d$, and
an intermediate phase for $1.1<d/l_B<1.8$ ($l_B$ is the magnetic length). The
transition from the exciton superfluid to the intermediate phase is identified
by (i) a dramatic change in the Berry curvature of the ground state under
twisted boundary conditions on the two layers; (ii) an energy level crossing of
the first excited state. The transition from the intermediate phase to the
composite Fermi liquid is identified by the vanishing of the exciton superfluid
stiffness. Furthermore, from our finite-size study, the energy cost of
transferring one electron between the layers shows an even-odd effect and
possibly extrapolates to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating
the enhanced intralayer correlation. Our identification of an intermediate
phase and its distinctive features shed new light on the theoretical
understanding of the quantum Hall bilayer system at total filling $\nu_T=1$.

QCD hard scattering in hadronic collisions. We examine the azimuthal
correlations between the system and one of its particles. We point out that the
perturbative QCD computation of such azimuthal correlations and asymmetries can
lead to divergent results at fixed perturbative orders. The fixed-order
divergences affect basic (and infrared safe) quantities such as the total cross
section at fixed (and arbitrary) values of the azimuthal-correlation angle
$\varphi$. Examples of processes with fixed-order divergences are heavy-quark
pair production, associated production of vector bosons and jets, dijet and
diboson production. A noticeable exception is the production of high-mass
lepton pairs through the Drell--Yan mechanism of quark-antiquark annihilation.
However, even in the Drell--Yan process, fixed-order divergences arise in the
computation of QED radiative corrections. We specify general conditions that
produce the divergences by discussing their physical origin in fixed-order
computations. We show lowest-order illustrative results for $\cos(n\varphi)$
asymmetries (with $n=1,2,4,6$) in top-quark pair production and associated
production of a vector boson and a jet at the LHC. The divergences are removed
by a proper all-order resummation procedure of the perturbative contributions.
Resummation leads to azimuthal asymmetries that are finite and computable. We
present first quantitative results of such a resummed computation for the
$\cos(2\varphi)$ asymmetry in top-quark pair production at the LHC.

with an input distribution that is non-stationary and unnormalized. To mitigate

found to be required by considering Akaike information criteria. The

reveals the existence of Compton thick type 2 nucleus with the line-of-sight
hydrogen column density of the torus of $N_{\rm H} = 10^{24.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
the inclination angle of $\theta_{\rm inc} = 90^{\circ}$. However, this model
fails to account for the Eddington ratio obtained with the optical observations
by Gu et al. (2001) and Shen et al. (2011), or requires the existence of a
supermassive black hole binary, which was suggested by Lobanov & Roland (2005),
thus this model is likely to be inappropriate for 3C 345. A partial covering
ionized absorber model which accounts for absorption in ""hard excess"" type 1
AGNs is also applied, and finds a Compton thick absorber with the column
density of $N_{\rm H} \simeq 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$, the ionization parameter of
$\log \xi \gtrsim 2$, and the covering fraction of $75\% \lesssim f_{c}
\lesssim 85\%$. Since this model obtains a black hole mass of $\log ( M_{\rm
BH} / M_{\odot} ) = 9.8$, which is consistent with the optical observation by
Gu et al. (2001), this model is likely to be the best-fitting model of this
source. The results suggest that 3C 345 is the most distant and most obscured

affecting its home or surroundings - often results from rising housing costs,
particularly in wealthy, prosperous cities. However, its dynamics are complex
and often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model of
urban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New settlements form
around a spatial amenity that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on the
resource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income,
skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either the original amenity
or to the emerging human agglomeration. As this agglomeration grows and
densifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers are displaced
from the spatial amenity on which they relied. Through path dependence,
high-income residents remain clustered around this original amenity for which
they have no direct use or interest. This toy model explores these dynamics,
demonstrating a simplified mechanism of how urban displacement and
gentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and varied
preferences for different types of amenities.

principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on entities
or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong
predictions. An epistemic formalism is developed, where concepts like
individual and collective knowledge are used, and knowledge may be actual or
potential. The physical state $S$ corresponds to the collective potential
knowledge. The state $S$ is a subset of a state space $\mathcal{S}=\{Z\}$, such
that $S$ always contains several elements $Z$, which correspond to unattainable
states of complete potential knowledge of the world. The evolution of $S$
cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution of the elements $Z$,
unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase space. The evolution of
$S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\in \mathbf{\mathbb{N}}$, which
is updated according to $n\rightarrow n+1$ each time potential knowledge
changes. In certain experimental contexts $C$, there is initial knowledge at
time $n$ that a given series of properties $P,P',\ldots$ will be observed
within a given time frame, meaning that a series of values $p,p',\ldots$ of
these properties will become known. At time $n$, it is just known that these

context $C$, it is possible to define a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{C}$
on top of $\mathcal{S}$, in which the elements are contextual state vectors
$\bar{S}_{C}$. Born's rule to calculate the probabilities to find the values
$p,p',\ldots$ is derived as the only generally applicable such rule. Also, we
can associate a self-adjoint operator $\bar{P}$ with eigenvalues $\{p\}$ to
each property $P$ observed within $C$. These operators obey
$[\bar{P},\bar{P}']=0$ if and only if the precise values of $P$ and $P'$ are

applications of carbon-based nano-materials. Ranging from environmental issues
to biomedical applications, it has the potential to address many of today's
dire problems. However, an understanding of the mechanism of transformation
between carbon allotropes at a microscopic level is crucial for its development
into highly desirable materials. In this work we report such a phase
transformation between two carbon allotropes, from penta-graphene (a
semiconductor) into biphenylene (a metal) under uniaxial loading. Using density
functional theory we demonstrated that the phase transformation occurs through
a synchronized reorganization of the carbon atoms with a simultaneous drop in
energy. The results of this work confirms that penta-graphene is a meta-stable
structure. On the other hand, a rigorous analysis of biphenylene suggests that
it is an energetically, mechanically, dynamically and thermally stable
structure, both in the form of a sheet and a tube. Its electronic structure
suggests that it is metallic in both these forms. Therefore, this work unravels
the possibility of phase transition in 2-D carbon systems and thereby designing
nano-materials capable of altering their properties in an instant. Furthermore,
heating biphenylene sheet at a high temperature (5000K) revealed another phase
transformation into a more stable hexa-graphene like structure. This proposes
thermal annealing as a possible method of synthesizing one 2-D carbon allotrope
from another.

The considered structures were just recently either experimentally synthesized

large scale simulations. A comparative analysis of these results revealed a
direct relationship between atomic density per area and elastic modulus.
Furthermore, for the networks that have an armchair and a zigzag orientation,
we observed that they were more stretchable in the zigzag direction than the
armchair direction. A critical analysis of the angular distributions and radial
distribution functions suggested that it could be due to the higher ability of
the networks to suppress the elongations of the bonds in the zigzag direction
by deforming the bond angles. The structural interpretations provided in this

band-limited shared communication networks which is a necessity for the design
of Large-Scale Cyber-Physical systems. To achieve this, we introduce simple
triggering conditions that do not require the exact knowledge of the

3\times 10^{-26} \,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ in order to generate the observed
dark matter abundance. We use observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the
Fermi Gamma-Ray Telescope and observations of the Galactic Center by the High
Energy Stereoscopic System to constrain these kination scenarios. Combining the
unitarity constraint on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ with these observational
constraints sets a lower limit on the temperature at which the Universe can
become radiation dominated following a period of kination if ${\langle \sigma v
\rangle > 3\times 10^{-31} \,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}}$. This lower limit is
between ${0.05 \, \mathrm{GeV}}$ and ${1 \, \mathrm{GeV}}$, depending on the
dark matter annihilation channel.

macroscopic crack in brittle heterogeneous materials through sudden jumps and
energy release events which are power law distributed with universal exponents.
This macroscopic crack growth is currently believed to exhibit similar
characteristics with the seismicity associated with earthquakes. Considering
that the crack front is self affine and exhibits Family-Vicsek universal
scaling, we show that the variance $\kappa_1 (\equiv\langle \chi^2\rangle
-\langle \chi \rangle^2)$ of natural time is equal to 0.0686, which almost
coincides with the value $\kappa_1\approx 0.07$ obtained from the seismicity
preceding major earthquakes. This sheds light on the determination of the
occurrence time of an impending mainshock.

uncontrolled, in the wild, environment. Often caused by the cameras limited
capabilities, it is common for these captured facial images to be blurred or
low resolution. Super resolution algorithms are therefore crucial in improving
the resolution of such images especially when the image size is small requiring
enlargement. This paper aims to demonstrate the effect of one of the
state-of-the-art algorithms in the field of image super resolution. To
demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm, various before and after 3D
face alignment cases are provided using the images from the Labeled Faces in
the Wild (lfw). Resulting images are subject to testing on a closed set face
recognition protocol using unsupervised algorithms with high dimension
extracted features. The inclusion of super resolution algorithm resulted in
significant improved recognition rate over recently reported results obtained
from unsupervised algorithms.

  Heterostructure via Ion Irradiation: Optical Evidences and Photonic
  Applications",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are receiving great attentions due to
their intriguing properties and potentials in many research fields. The flow of
charge carriers in vdW heterostructures can be efficiently rectified by the
inter-layer coupling between neighboring layers, offering a rich collection of
functionalities and a mechanism for designing atomically thin devices.
Nevertheless, non-uniform contact in larger-area heterostructures reduces the
device efficiency. In this work, ion irradiation had been verified as an
efficient technique to enhance the contact and interlayer coupling in the newly
developed graphene/WSe2 hetero-structure with a large area of 10 mm x 10 mm.
During the ion irradiation process, the morphology of monolayer graphene had
been modified, promoting the contact with WSe2. Experimental evidences of the
tunable interlayer electron transfer are displayed by investigation of
photoluminescence and ultrafast absorption of the irradiated heterostructure.
Besides, we have found that in graphene/WSe2 heterostructure, graphene serves
as a fast channel for the photo-excited carriers to relax in WSe2, and the
nonlinear absorption of WSe2 could be effectively tuned by the carrier transfer
process in graphene, enabling specific optical absorption of the
heterostructure in comparison with separated graphene or WSe2. On the basis of
these new findings, by applying the ion beam modified graphene/WSe2
heterostructure as a saturable absorber, Q-switched pulsed lasing with
optimized performance has been realized in a Nd:YAG waveguide cavity. This work
paves the way towards developing novel devices based on large-area
heterostructures by using ion beam irradiation.

  properties of light-emitting diodes based on (In,Ga)N/GaN nanowires",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the experimental electroluminescence (EL) spectra of light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) based on N-polar (In,Ga)N/GaN nanowires (NWs), we observed a double peak
structure. The relative intensity of the two peaks evolves in a peculiar way
with injected current. Spatially and spectrally resolved EL maps confirmed the
presence of two main transitions in the spectra, and suggested that they are
emitted by the majority of single nano-LEDs. In order to elucidate the physical
origin of this effect, we performed theoretical calculations of the strain,
electric field, and charge density distributions both for planar LEDs and
NW-LEDs. On this basis, we simulated also the EL spectra of these devices,
which exhibit a double peak structure for N-polar heterostructures, both in the
NW and the planar case. In contrast, this feature is not observed when Ga-polar
planar LEDs are simulated. We found that the physical origin of the double peak
structure is a stronger quantum-confined Stark effect occurring in the first
and last quantum well of the N-polar heterostructures. The peculiar evolution
of the relative peak intensities with injected current, seen only in the case
of the NW-LED, is attributed to the three-dimensional strain variation
resulting from elastic relaxation at the free sidewalls of the NWs. Therefore,
this study provides important insights on the working principle of N-polar LEDs
based on both planar and NW heterostructures.

Each subcarrier is switched to either the energy harvesting unit or the

implement the system, one-bit feedback is required for each subcarrier. Two
optimization problems are defined, converted to binary knapsack problems, and
solved using dynamic programming approaches. Upper bounds are obtained using
continuous relaxations. Power allocation is integrated to further increase the
performance. Numerical studies show that the proposed frequency switching based
