the feedback of high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) to prove the statistical
validity of the most common schemes used to define an evolutionary sequence for
high-mass clumps, and characterise the sensitivity of different tracers to this
process. Methods: From the spectroscopic follow-ups of the ATLASGAL TOP100
sample, we selected several multiplets of CH3CN, CH3CCH, and CH3OH emission
lines to derive and compare the physical properties of the gas in the clumps
along the evolutionary sequence. Our findings are compared with results
obtained from CO isotopologues, dust, and NH3 from previous studies on the same
sample. Results: The chemical properties of each species have a major role on
the measured physical properties. Low temperatures are traced by NH3, CH3OH,
and CO (in the early phases), the warm and dense envelope can be probed with
CH3CN, CH3CCH, and, in evolved sources via CO isotopologues. CH3OH and CH3CN
are also abundant in the hot cores, and their high-excitation transitions may
be good tools to study the kinematics in the hot gas surrounding the YSOs that
these clumps are hosting. All tracers show, to different degrees, progressive
warming with evolution. The relation between gas temperature and L/M is
reproduced by a toy model of a spherical, internally heated clump. Conclusions:
The evolutionary sequence defined for the clumps is statistically valid and we
could identify the processes dominating in different intervals of L/M. For
L/M<2Lsun/Msun a large quantity of gas is still being accumulated and
compressed at the bottom of the potential well. Between
2Lsun/Msun<L/M<40Lsun/Msun the YSOs gain mass and increase in L; the first hot
cores appear around L/M=10Lsun/Msun. Finally, for L/M>40Lsun/Msun HII regions
become common, showing that dissipation of the parental clump dominates.

methods to assess the dynamic complexity of individual processes at different

has never been formalized theoretically, and empirical evaluations are
complicated by practical issues such as filtering and downsampling. Here we
extend the very popular measure of Granger causality (GC), a prominent tool for
assessing directed lagged interactions between joint processes, to quantify
information transfer across multiple time scales. We show that the multiscale
processing of a vector autoregressive (AR) process introduces a moving average
(MA) component, and describe how to represent the resulting ARMA process using
state space (SS) models and to combine the SS model parameters for computing
exact GC values at arbitrarily large time scales. We exploit the theoretical
formulation to identify peculiar features of multiscale GC in basic AR
processes, and demonstrate with numerical simulations the much larger
estimation accuracy of the SS approach compared with pure AR modeling of
filtered and downsampled data. The improved computational reliability is
exploited to disclose meaningful multiscale patterns of information transfer

boundaries and physical processes that act over a wide range of scales.
Constructing geographically constrained boundary-conforming spatial
discretizations of these domains with flexible use of anisotropically, fully
unstructured meshes is a challenge. The problem contains a wide range of scales
and a relatively large, heterogeneous constraint parameter space. Approaches
are commonly ad hoc, model or application specific and insufficiently
described. Development of new spatial domains is frequently time-consuming,
hard to repeat, error prone and difficult to ensure consistent due to the
significant human input required. As a consequence, it is difficult to
reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data handling and
initialization, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons rigorously.
Moreover, for flexible unstructured meshes, there is additionally a greater
potential for inconsistencies in model initialization and forcing parameters.
This paper introduces a consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for
geophysical models, that is automated, quick-to-draft and repeat, and provides
a rigorous and robust approach that is consistent to the source data
throughout. The approach is enabling further new research in complex
multi-scale domains, difficult or not possible to achieve with existing
methods. Examples being actively pursued in a range of geophysical modeling
efforts are presented alongside the approach, together with the implementation

research towards the use of binary descriptors as they are reported

The late fusion of binary and local descriptor is selected because among binary

simulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic,
fully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous

it can be difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data

considering it much like a numerical simulation model problem of its own. It
introduces a generalised, extensible, self-documenting approach to carefully
describe, and necessarily fully, the constraints over the heterogeneous
parameter space that determine how a domain is spatially discretised. This
additionally provides a method to accurately record these constraints, using
high-level natural language based abstractions, that enables full accounts of

generalised consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for geophysical
models is developed, that is automated, robust and repeatable, quick-to-draft,

interprets the description above to execute a self-consistent spatial

using data collected by the CLEO-c detector. An amplitude analysis is performed
in order to disentangle the various intermediate state contributions. To limit
the model complexity a data driven regularization procedure is applied. The
prominent contributions are the decay modes $D^0\to a_1(1260)^+\pi^-$, $D^0\to
\sigma f_0(1370)$ and $D^0 \to \rho(770)^0 \rho(770)^0$. The broad resonances
$a_1(1260)^+$, $\pi(1300)^+$ and $a_1(1640)^+$ are studied in detail, including
quasi-model-independent parametrizations of their lineshapes. The mass and
width of the $a_1(1260)^+$ meson are determined to be
$m_{a_1(1260)^+}=[1225\pm9\text{(stat)}\pm17\text{(syst)}\pm10\text{(model)}]\text{MeV}/c^2$
and $\Gamma_{a_1(1260)^+}=[430\pm24\text{(stat)}\pm25
\text{(syst)}\pm18\text{(model)}]\text{MeV}$. The amplitude model of $D^0\to
K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decays obtained from CLEO II.V, CLEO III, and CLEO-c data is
revisited with improved lineshape parametrizations. The largest components are
the decay modes $D^0\to\phi(1020)\rho(770)^0$, $D^0 \to K_1(1270)^+ K^-$ and
$D^0 \to K(1400)^+ K^-$. The fractional $CP$-even content of the decay $D^0\to
\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ is calculated from the amplitude model to be
$F_+^{4\pi}=[72.9\pm0.9\text{(stat)}\pm1.5\text{(syst)}\pm1.0\text{(model)}]\%$,
consistent with that obtained from a previous model-independent measurement.
For $D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decays, the $CP$-even fraction is measured for
the first time and found to be
$F_+^{KK\pi\pi}=[75.3\pm1.8\text{(stat)}\pm3.3\text{(syst)}\pm3.5\text{(model)}]\%$.
The global decay rate asymmetries between $D^0$ and $\overline{D}^0$ decays are
measured to be
$A^{4\pi}_{CP}=[+0.54\pm1.04\text{(stat)}\pm0.51\text{(syst)}]\%$ and
$A^{KK\pi\pi}_{CP}=[+1.84\pm1.74\text{(stat)}\pm0.30\text{(syst)}]\%$.

a networked game is studied. Players are only able to choose their decisions
from a feasible action set. The feasible set is considered to be a private
linear equality constraint that is coupled through decisions of the other
players. We consider that each player has his own private constraint and it has
not to be shared with the other players. This general case also embodies the
one with shared constraints between players and it can be also simply extended
to the case with inequality constraints. Since the players don't have access to
other players' actions, they need to exchange estimates of others' actions and
a local copy of the Lagrangian multiplier with their neighbors over a connected
communication graph. We develop a relatively fast algorithm by reformulating
the conservative GNE problem within the framework of inexact-ADMM. The
convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed under a few mild assumptions on cost
functions. Finally, the algorithm is simulated for a wireless ad-hoc network.

feedback stabilization of a swarm of agents on a finite state space whose time
evolution is modeled as a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). The resulting
(mean-field) control problem is that of controlling a nonlinear system with
desired global stability properties. We first prove that any probability
distribution with a strongly connected support can be stabilized using
time-invariant inputs. Secondly, we show the asymptotic controllability of all
possible probability distributions, including distributions that assign zero
density to some states and which do not necessarily have a strongly connected
support. Lastly, we demonstrate that there always exists a globally
asymptotically stabilizing decentralized density feedback law with the
additional property that the control inputs are zero at equilibrium, whenever
the graph is strongly connected and bidirected. Then the problem of
synthesizing closed-loop polynomial feedback is framed as a optimization
problem using state-of-the-art sum-of-squares optimization tools. The
optimization problem searches for polynomial feedback laws that make the
candidate Lyapunov function a stability certificate for the resulting
closed-loop system. Our methodology is tested for two cases on a five vertex
graph, and the stabilization properties of the constructed control laws are
validated with numerical simulations of the corresponding system of ordinary
differential equations.

baryon acoustic oscillations and the cosmic microwave background radiation from
WMAP and Planck measurements to estimate the equation of state parameters. We
obtained that both $f_{gas}$ samples provide consistent constraints on the

quantitatively explained by a combination of two effects arising in a wet
granulate: i) enhanced friction at particle contacts in the presence of
attractive capillary forces, and ii) energy dissipation due to the rupture and
reformation of liquid bridges. Coulomb friction at grain contacts gives rise to
an energy dissipation which grows linearly with increasing confining pressure,

coefficient in the case of wet grains, as the confining pressure increases the
energy dissipation for dry systems is faster than for wet ones.

renders joint modeling of those two sources of data necessary. To tackle the
above problems, in this paper, we utilize the rich framework of (temporal)
point processes to model event data and timely update its intensity function by
the synergic twin Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In the proposed
architecture, the intensity function is synergistically modulated by one RNN
with asynchronous events as input and another RNN with time series as input.
Furthermore, to enhance the interpretability of the model, the attention

allows a black-box treatment for modeling the intensity. We substantiate the

As software projects change continuously, it is crucial to understand how the
build system changes because neglecting its maintenance can lead to expensive
build breakage. Recent studies have investigated the (co-)evolution of build
configurations and reasons for build breakage, but they did this only on a
coarse grained level. In this paper, we present BUILDDIFF, an approach to
extract detailed build changes from MAVEN build files and classify them into 95
change types. In a manual evaluation of 400 build changing commits, we show
that BUILDDIFF can extract and classify build changes with an average precision
and recall of 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. We then present two studies using
the build changes extracted from 30 open source Java projects to study the
frequency and time of build changes. The results show that the top 10 most
frequent change types account for 73% of the build changes. Among them, changes
to version numbers and changes to dependencies of the projects occur most
frequently. Furthermore, our results show that build changes occur frequently
around releases. With these results, we provide the basis for further research,
such as for analyzing the (co-)evolution of build files with other artifacts or
improving effort estimation approaches. Furthermore, our detailed change
information enables improvements of refactoring approaches for build
configurations and improvements of models to identify error-prone build files.

In this paper, we describe crowd-sourcing universal part-of-speech tags for the

annotation task into three subtasks: one in which a subset of tokens are
labeled automatically, one in which questions are specifically designed to
disambiguate a subset of high frequency words, and a more general cascaded
approach for the remaining data in which questions are displayed to the worker
following a decision tree structure. Each subtask is extended and adapted for a
multilingual setting and the universal tagset. The quality of the annotation
process is measured using hidden check questions annotated with gold labels.
The overall agreement between gold standard labels and the majority vote is
between 0.95 and 0.96 for just three labels and the average recall across

evolution most disks lack sufficient dust to form giant planet cores. Stacking
the individually undetected continuum sources limits their average dust mass to
5$\times$ lower than that of the faintest detected disk, supporting theoretical
models that indicate rapid dissipation once disk clearing begins. Comparing the
protoplanetary disk population in $\sigma$ Orionis to those of other
star-forming regions supports the steady decline in average dust mass and the
steepening of the $M_{\rm dust}$-$M_{\ast}$ relation with age; studying these
evolutionary trends can inform the relative importance of different disk
processes during key eras of planet formation. External photoevaporation from
the central O9 star is influencing disk evolution throughout the region: dust
masses clearly decline with decreasing separation from the photoionizing
source, and the handful of CO detections exist at projected separations $>1.5$
pc. Collectively, our findings indicate that giant planet formation is
inherently rare and/or well underway by a few Myr of age.

ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium over their gas content. In this
paper, we investigate this process through a set of simulations of Milky Way
like galaxies falling inside idealised clusters of 10$^{14}$ M$_\odot$ and
10$^{15}$ M$_\odot$, containing a cool-core or not, using the adaptive mesh
refinement code RAMSES. We use these simulations to constrain how much of the
initial mass contained in the gaseous disk of the galaxy will be converted into
stars and how much of it will be lost, after a single crossing of the entire
cluster. We find that, if the galaxy reaches the central region of a cool-core
cluster, it is expected to lose all its gas, independently of its entry
conditions and of the cluster's mass. On the other hand, it is expected to
never lose all its gas after crossing a cluster without a cool-core just once.
Before reaching the centre of the cluster, the SFR of the galaxy is always
enhanced, by a factor of 1.5 to 3. If the galaxy crosses the cluster without
being completely stripped, its final amount of gas is on average two times
smaller after crossing the 10$^{15}$ M$_\odot$ cluster, relative to the
10$^{14}$ M$_\odot$ cluster. This is reflected in the final SFR of the galaxy,
which is also two times smaller in the former, ranging from 0.5 $-$ 1 M$_\odot$

interactions in young star-forming clusters and/or associations. This is done
using a combination of analytic methods and numerical simulations of 2+2
scattering interactions, both in isolation and in a homogeneous background
potential. We focus on interactions that produce two single stars and a binary,
and study the outcomes as a function of the depth of the background potential,
within a range typical of cluster cores. As reference parameters for the
observational properties, we use those observed for the system of runaway stars
AE Aur and $\mu$ Col and binary $\iota$ Ori. We find that the outcome fractions
have no appreciable dependence on the depth of the potential, and neither do
the velocities of the ejected single stars. However, as the potential gets
deeper and a larger fraction of binaries remain trapped, two binary populations
emerge, with the escaped component having higher speeds and shorter semi-major
axes than the trapped one. Additionally, we find that the relative angles
between the ejected products are generally large. In particular, the angle
between the ejected fastest star and the escaped binary is typically $\gtrsim
120-135^{\circ}$, with a peak at around $160^{\circ}$. However, as the
potential gets deeper, the angle distribution becomes broader. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of the
properties of the runaway stars AE Aur and $\mu$ Col.

any RV Tau star to date spanning a baseline of $\sim$4 years and clearly

measured DF Cyg's formal period (the time interval between two successive deep
minima) to be $~49.84 \pm 0.02~$days. The trend in the arrival times emulates
that of the long-term period. There appears to be precisely 16 deep+shallow

features an infrared excess indicative of a disk possibly linked to a binary
companion. From a recent Gaia parallax measurement for DF Cyg, we calculated
that it has a distance of $990 \pm 372$pc and a physical radius of $R_\star =

the most likely interpretation for the decrease in flux from the long-period

Tangent Cylinder (TC), for Ekman numbers down to $E=3.36\times10^{-6}$, in a
configuration relevant to the liquid core of the Earth. In the apparatus, the
TC results from the Proudman-Taylor constraint incurred by rotating a
hemispherical fluid vessel heated in its centre by a protruding heating element
of cylindrical shape. The resulting convection that develops above the heater,
i.e within the TC, is shown to set in for critical Rayleigh numbers and
wavenumbers respectively scaling as $Ra_c\sim E^{4/3}$ and $a_c\sim E^{1/3}$
with the Ekman number $E$. Though exhibiting the same exponents as for plane
rotating convection, these laws are indicative of much larger convective plumes
at onset. The structure and dynamics of these plumes are in fact closer to
those found in solid rotating cylinders heated from below, suggesting that the
confinement within the TC induced by the Taylor-Proudman constraint influences
convection in a similar way as solid walls would do. There is further
similarity in that the critical modes in the TC all exhibit a slow retrograde
precession at onset. In supercritical regimes, the precession evolves into a
thermal wind with a complex structure featuring retrograde rotation at high
latitude and either prograde or retrograde rotation at low latitudes (close to
the heater), depending on the criticality and the Ekman number. Nevertheless
the intensity of the thermal wind measured by the Rossby number scales as
$Ro\sim 0.85(Ra_q^*)^{0.41}$ with the Rayleigh number based on the heat flux
$Ra_q^*$. This scaling suggests that the convection in the TC is driven by
quasi-geostrophic dynamics, a finding supported by the scaling for the
rotation-normalised Nusselt number $Nu^{*} \sim (Ra_{q}^{*})^{5/9}$.

the Hadwiger number of a convex body is the maximum vertex degree over all such
contact graphs. In this paper, we investigate the Hadwiger and contact numbers
of totally separable packings of convex domains, which we refer to as the
separable Hadwiger number and the separable contact number, respectively. We
show that the separable Hadwiger number of any smooth convex domain is $4$ and
the maximum separable contact number of any packing of $n$ translates of a
smooth strictly convex domain is $\left\lfloor 2n - 2\sqrt{n}\right\rfloor$.
Our proofs employ a characterization of total separability in terms of
hemispherical caps on the boundary of a convex body, Auerbach bases of finite

perimeter polyominoes and an approximation of smooth $o$-symmetric strictly

reproduced from an amplitude that is factorized before the splitting occurs. We
confirm results at one-loop, through single Glauber exchange, and at two-loops,
through double Glauber exchange. To approach the calculation, we begin by
reviewing the importance of Glauber scaling for factorization. We show that for
any situation where initial state and final state particles are not collinear,
the Glauber contribution is entirely contained in the soft contribution. The
contributions coming from Glauber operators are necessarily non-analytic
functions of external momentum, with the non-analyticity arising from the
rapidity regulator. The non-analyticity is critical so that Glauber operators
can both preserve factorization when it holds and produce
factorization-violating effects when they are present.

integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) galaxy surveys spanning absolute $K$-band
magnitude $-21.5 > M_K > -26.6$, or stellar mass $8 \times 10^{9} < M_* < 2
\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. We find these galaxies to reside in a diverse range of
environments measured by four methods: group membership (whether a galaxy is a
brightest group/cluster galaxy, satellite, or isolated), halo mass, large-scale
mass density (measured over a few Mpc), and local mass density (measured within
the $N$th neighbour). The spatially resolved IFS stellar kinematics provide
robust measurements of the spin parameter $\lambda_e$ and enable us to examine
the relationship among $\lambda_e$, $M_*$, and galaxy environment. We find a
strong correlation between $\lambda_e$ and $M_*$, where the average $\lambda_e$
decreases from $\sim 0.4$ to below 0.1 with increasing mass, and the fraction
of slow rotators $f_{\rm slow}$ increases from $\sim 10$% to 90%. We show for
the first time that at fixed $M_*$, there are almost no trends between galaxy
spin and environment; the apparent kinematic morphology-density relation for
ETGs is therefore primarily driven by $M_*$ and is accounted for by the joint
correlations between $M_*$ and spin, and between $M_*$ and environment. A
possible exception is that the increased $f_{\rm slow}$ at high local density
is slightly more than expected based only on these joint correlations. Our
results suggest that the physical processes responsible for building up the
present-day stellar masses of massive galaxies are also very efficient at
reducing their spin, in any environment.

raise the question of how localization may affect the regulatory activity of

show that the non-uniform spatial distributions of mRNA can alter the
threshold-linear response that characterizes sRNAs that act stoichiometrically,
and modulate the hierarchy among targets co-regulated by the same sRNA. We also
identify conditions where the sub-cellular organization of cofactors in the
sRNA pathway can induce spatial heterogeneity on sRNA targets. Our results
suggest that under certain conditions, interpretation and modeling of natural
and synthetic gene regulatory circuits need to take into account the spatial
organization of the transcripts of participating genes.

indicates that assigning fitness based on team vs.\ individual behavior has a
strong impact on the ability of evolved teams of artificial agents to exhibit

single-objective evolution. In contrast, when a multiobjective evolutionary
algorithm is used, populations can be subject to individual-level objectives,
team-level objectives, or combinations of the two. This paper explores the
performance of cooperatively coevolved teams of agents controlled by artificial
neural networks subject to these types of objectives. Specifically, predator
agents are evolved to capture scripted prey agents in a torus-shaped grid
world. Because of the tension between individual and team behaviors, multiple
modes of behavior can be useful, and thus the effect of modular neural networks
is also explored. Results demonstrate that fitness rewarding individual
behavior is superior to fitness rewarding team behavior, despite being applied
to a cooperative task. However, the use of networks with multiple modules
allows predators to discover intelligent behavior, regardless of which type of
objectives are used.

may have physical conditions (high gas densities) required to form stars.
Indeed, several recent models predict that such massive galactic outflows may
ignite star formation within the outflow itself. This star-formation mode, in
which stars form with high radial velocities, could contribute to the
morphological evolution of galaxies, to the evolution in size and velocity
dispersion of the spheroidal component of galaxies, and would contribute to the
population of high-velocity stars, which could even escape the galaxy. Such
star formation could provide in-situ chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic
and intergalactic medium (through supernova explosions of young stars on large
orbits), and some models also predict that it may contribute substantially to
the global star formation rate observed in distant galaxies. Although there
exists observational evidence for star formation triggered by outflows or jets
into their host galaxy, as a consequence of gas compression, evidence for star
formation occurring within galactic outflows is still missing. Here we report
new spectroscopic observations that unambiguously reveal star formation
occurring in a galactic outflow at a redshift of 0.0448. The inferred star
formation rate in the outflow is larger than 15 Msun/yr. Star formation may
also be occurring in other galactic outflows, but may have been missed by
previous observations owing to the lack of adequate diagnostics.

programs (UQPs) approximately, which are known to be NP-hard. In the UQP
framework, we maximize a quadratic function of a vector of complex variables
with unit modulus. Several problems in active sensing and wireless
communication applications boil down to UQP. With this motivation, we present
three new heuristic methods with polynomial-time complexity to solve the UQP
approximately. The first method is called dominant-eigenvector-matching; here
the solution is picked that matches the complex arguments of the dominant
eigenvector of the Hermitian matrix in the UQP formulation. We also provide a
performance guarantee for this method. The second method, a greedy strategy, is
shown to provide a performance guarantee of (1-1/e) with respect to the optimal
objective value given that the objective function possesses a property called
string submodularity. The third heuristic method is called row-swap greedy
strategy, which is an extension to the greedy strategy and utilizes certain
properties of the UQP to provide a better performance than the greedy strategy
at the expense of an increase in computational complexity. We present numerical
results to demonstrate the performance of these heuristic methods, and also
compare the performance of these methods against a standard heuristic method

of functionally graded bars under torsional loading is presented. The
formulation is general in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary
cross-section made of any type of elastoplastic material. In material science
the Functionally Graded Material (FGM) is a non-homogeneous composite which
performs as a single-phase material, by unifying the best properties of its
constituent phase material. The nonlinear elastic-plastic behavior is treated
by employing the deformation theory of plasticity. According to this theory,
the material constants are assumed variable within the cross section, and are
updated through an iterative process so as the equivalent stress and strain at
each point coincide with the uniaxial material curve. In this investigation a
new straightforward nonlinear procedure is introduced in the deformation theory
of plasticity which simplifies the solution method. At each iteration step, the
warping function is obtained by solving the torsion problem of a
non-homogeneous isotropic bar using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in
conjunction with the Analog Equation Method (AEM). Without restricting the
generality, the FGM material is comprised of a ceramic phase and a metal phase.
The ceramic is assumed to behave linearly elastic, whereas the metal is modeled
as an elastic-linear hardening material. Furthermore, the TTO homogenization
scheme for estimating the effective properties of the two-phase FGM was
adopted. Several bars with various cross-sections and material types are
analyzed, in order to validate the proposed model and exemplify its salient
features. Moreover, useful conclusion are drawn from the elastic-plastic
behavior of functionally graded bars under torsional loading.

the nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.
Instead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the
observed system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may
produce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence
of sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of
non-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it
consists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series
of an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be
used to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without
using blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.
The method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the
audio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4)

obtained by wet chemical routes followed by a thermal treatment at low

W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy phases that were used as hydrogen evolution
catalysts. We observed a Tafel slope of 38.7 mV dec$^{-1}$ and 96 mV onset
potential (at current density of 10 mA cm$^{-2}$) when the heterostructure
alloy is annealed at 300 $^o$C. These results indicate that heterostructure
formed by graphene and W$_{0.4}$Mo$_{0.6}$S$_2$ alloys are far more efficient
than WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ by at least a factor of two, and it is superior than
any other reported TMD system. This strategy offers a cheap and low temperature
synthesis alternative able to replace Pt in the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER). Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the alloy is stable over time,
i.e. the catalytic activity does not experience a significant change even after
1000 cycles. Using density functional theory calculations, we found that this
enhanced hydrogen evolution in the W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloys is mainly due to
the lower energy barrier created by a favorable overlap of the d-orbitals from
the transition metals and the s-orbitals of H$_2$, with the lowest energy
barrier occurring for W$_{0.4}$Mo$_{0.6}$S$_2$ alloy. Thus, it is now possible
to further improve the performance of the ""inert"" TMD basal plane via metal
alloying, in addition to the previously reported strategies of creation of
point defects, vacancies and edges. The synthesis of

inhomogeneous Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) structures, b) a detailed chemical
analysis behind the CR-induced destruction of CO, and c) exploring the thermal
state of CR-irradiated molecular gas. CRs permeating the interstellar medium
with $\zeta_{\rm CR}$$\gtrsim 10\times$(Galactic) are found to significantly
reduce the [CO]/[H$_2$] abundance ratios throughout the mass of a GMC. CO
rotational line imaging will then show much clumpier structures than the actual
ones. For $\zeta_{\rm CR}$$\gtrsim 100\times$(Galactic) this bias becomes
severe, limiting the utility of CO lines for recovering structural and
dynamical characteristics of H$_2$-rich galaxies throughout the Universe,
including many of the so-called Main Sequence (MS) galaxies where the bulk of
cosmic star formation occurs. Both C$^+$ and C abundances increase with rising
$\zeta_{\rm CR}$, with C remaining the most abundant of the two throughout
H$_2$ clouds, when $\zeta_{\rm CR}\sim (1-100)\times$(Galactic). C$^+$ starts
to dominate for $\zeta_{\rm CR}$$\gtrsim 10^3\times$(Galactic). The thermal
state of the gas in the inner and denser regions of GMCs is invariant with
$T_{\rm gas}\sim 10\,{\rm K}$ for $\zeta_{\rm CR}\sim (1-10)\times$(Galactic).
For $\zeta_{\rm CR}$$\sim 10^3\times$(Galactic) this is no longer the case and
$T_{\rm gas}\sim 30-50\,{\rm K}$ are reached. Finally we identify OH as the key

particles with black body spectrum, i.e. Hawking radiation. Therefore, if the
black hole is surrounded by an isolated box, there is a thermal equilibrium
between the black hole and radiation gas. A simple case considering the thermal
equilibrium between the Schwarzschild black hole and radiation gas in an
isolated box has been well investigated previously in detail, i.e. taking the
conservation of energy and principle of maximal entropy for the isolated system
into account. In this paper, following the above spirit, the effects of massive
graviton on the thermal equilibrium will be investigated. For the gravity with
massive graviton, we will use the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive
gravity which has been proven to be ghost free. Because the graviton mass
depends on two parameters in the dRGT massive gravity, here we just investigate
two simple cases related to the two parameters, respectively. Our results show
that in the first case the massive graviton can suppress or increase the
condensation of black hole in the radiation gas although the $T-E$ diagram is
similar like the Schwarzschild black hole case. For the second case, a new
$T-E$ diagram has been obtained. Moreover, an interesting and important
prediction is that the condensation of black hole just increases from the zero
radius of horizon in this case, which is very different from the Schwarzschild
black hole case.

classifying multiple targets on an image (e.g., the basic target is a pixel or
a receptive field in segmentation, and an object proposal in detection), which
inspires us to optimize a loss function over a set of pixels/proposals for
generating adversarial perturbations. Based on this idea, we propose a novel
algorithm named Dense Adversary Generation (DAG), which generates a large
family of adversarial examples, and applies to a wide range of state-of-the-art
deep networks for segmentation and detection. We also find that the adversarial
perturbations can be transferred across networks with different training data,
based on different architectures, and even for different recognition tasks. In
particular, the transferability across networks with the same architecture is
more significant than in other cases. Besides, summing up heterogeneous

considers risk aversion arising due to a non-linear utility for money. Yet
behavioral studies have established that real agents exhibit risk attitudes
which cannot be captured by any expected utility model. We initiate the study
of revenue-optimal mechanisms under buyer behavioral models beyond expected
utility theory. We adopt a model from prospect theory which arose to explain
these discrepancies and incorporates agents under-weighting uncertain outcomes.
In our model, an event occurring with probability $x < 1$ is worth strictly
less to the agent than $x$ times the value of the event when it occurs with
certainty.
  In contrast to the risk-neutral setting, the optimal mechanism may be
randomized and appears challenging to find, even for a single buyer and a
single item for sale. Nevertheless, we give a characterization of the optimal
mechanism which enables positive approximation results. In particular, we show
that under a reasonable bounded-risk-aversion assumption, posted pricing
obtains a constant approximation. Notably, this result is ""risk-robust"" in that
it does not depend on the details of the buyer's risk attitude. Finally, we
examine a dynamic setting in which the buyer is uncertain about his future
value. In contrast to positive results for a risk-neutral buyer, we show that
the buyer's risk aversion may prevent the seller from approximating the optimal
revenue in a risk-robust manner.

  In this paper we present GraphZip, a scalable method for mining interesting

the presence of large and non-linear variations during the face development

the aging process into multiple short-term stages. Then, a novel generative
probabilistic model, named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving (TNVP)
transformation, is presented to model the facial aging process at each stage.
Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which requires an empirical
balance threshold, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), an intractable
model, our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function,
exact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations
between faces in consecutive stages. Our model shows its advantages not only in
capturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing
a smooth synthesis in age progression across faces. Our approach can model any
face in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points. Moreover, the
structure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping
the advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density
estimation. Our method is evaluated in both terms of synthesizing
age-progressed faces and cross-age face verification and consistently shows the
state-of-the-art results in various face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, MORPH,

effects may be sparse. Accordingly, the mean matrix can be estimated by solving
a penalized regression problem, applying a lasso penalty to the elementwise

specifying appropriate values of the penalty parameters is not. Leveraging the
posterior mode interpretation of the penalized regression problem, moment-based
empirical Bayes estimators of the penalty parameters can be defined. Estimation
of the mean matrix using these these moment-based empirical Bayes estimators
can be called LANOVA penalization, and the corresponding estimate of the mean

shown to be consistent. Additionally, LANOVA penalization is extended to
accommodate sparsity of row and column effects and to estimate an unknown mean
tensor. The behavior of the LANOVA estimate is examined under misspecification
of the distribution of the elementwise effects, and LANOVA penalization is
applied to several datasets, including a matrix of microarray data, a three-way

point detection methods for color images, by associating each medial point with
a local scale; ii) inspired by the invertibility property of the binary MAT, we
also associate each medial point with a local encoding that allows us to invert
the AMAT, reconstructing the input image; iii) we describe a clustering scheme
that takes advantage of the additional scale and appearance information to
group individual points into medial branches, providing a shape decomposition
of the underlying image regions. In our experiments, we show state-of-the-art
performance in medial point detection on Berkeley Medial AXes (BMAX500), a new
dataset of medial axes based on the BSDS500 database, and good generalization
on the SK506 and WH-SYMMAX datasets. We also measure the quality of
reconstructed images from BMAX500, obtained by inverting their computed AMAT.
Our approach delivers significantly better reconstruction quality with respect

Planck significantly reduces the allowed space of HI reionization models,
pointing toward a later ending and/or less extended phase transition than
previously believed. Reionization impulsively heats the intergalactic medium
(IGM) to $\sim10^4$ K, and owing to long cooling and dynamical times in the
diffuse gas, comparable to the Hubble time, memory of reionization heating is
retained. Therefore, a late ending reionization has significant implications
for the structure of the $z\sim5-6$ Lyman-$\alpha$ (ly$\alpha$) forest. Using
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations that allow us to vary the timing of
reionization and its associated heat injection, we argue that extant thermal
signatures from reionization can be detected via the Ly$\alpha$ forest power
spectrum at $5< z<6$. This arises because the small-scale cutoff in the power
depends not only the the IGM temperature at these epochs, but is also
particularly sensitive to the pressure smoothing scale set by the IGM full
thermal history. Comparing our different reionization models with existing
measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum at $z=5.0-5.4$, we
find that models satisfying Planck's $\tau_e$, constraint favor a moderate
amount of heat injection consistent with galaxies driving reionization, but
disfavoring quasar-driven scenarios. We explore the impact of different
reionization histories and heating models on the shape of the power spectrum,
and find that they can produce similar effects, but argue that this degeneracy
can be broken with high enough quality data. We study the feasibility of
measuring the flux power spectrum at $z\simeq 6$ using mock quasar spectra and
conclude that a sample of $\sim10$ high-resolution spectra with an attainable
signal-to-noise ratio will allow distinguishing between different reionization
scenarios.

imply efficient approximation algorithms for a very general class of (adaptive)

  In tandem with these broad applications, we examine the structure and design

measure the activities of large numbers of neurons simultaneously in behaving

a first-order approximation of the neuron's activity over time. Determining the
exact time at which a neuron spikes on the basis of its fluorescence trace is
an important open problem in the field of computational neuroscience.
  Recently, a convex optimization problem involving an $\ell_1$ penalty was
proposed for this task. In this paper, we slightly modify that recent proposal
by replacing the $\ell_1$ penalty with an $\ell_0$ penalty. In stark contrast
to the conventional wisdom that $\ell_0$ optimization problems are
computationally intractable, we show that the resulting optimization problem
can be efficiently solved for the global optimum using an extremely simple and
efficient dynamic programming algorithm. Our R-language implementation of the
proposed algorithm runs in a few minutes on fluorescence traces of $100,000$
timesteps. Furthermore, our proposal leads to substantial improvements over the
previous $\ell_1$ proposal, in simulations as well as on two calcium imaging

than the frequency of its translational mode. Because of the frequency
mismatch, the intrinsic coupling between librational and translational modes is
very weak in vacuum. Here we propose a scheme to couple its librational and

After the initial
stage of planet formation is complete, the gravitational interactions between
planets can lead to the physical collision of two planets, or the ejection of
one or more planets from the system. When this occurs, the remaining planets
are typically left in more eccentric orbits. Here we use present-day
eccentricities of the observed exoplanet population to reconstruct the initial
mass function of exoplanets before the onset of dynamical instability. We
developed a Bayesian framework that combines data from N-body simulations with
present-day observations to compute a probability distribution for the planets
that were ejected or collided in the past. Integrating across the exoplanet
population, we obtained an estimate of the initial mass function of exoplanets.
We find that the ejected planets are primarily sub-Saturn type planets. While
the present-day distribution appears to be bimodal, with peaks around $\sim 1
M_{\rm J}$ and $\sim 20 M_\oplus$, this bimodality does not seem to be
primordial. Instead, planets around $\sim 60 M_\oplus$ appear to be
preferentially removed by dynamical instabilities. Attempts to reproduce
exoplanet populations using population synthesis codes should be mindful of the
fact that the present population has been depleted of intermediate-mass
planets. Future work should explore how the system architecture and
multiplicity might alter our results.

accelerating the inference process of convolutional neural networks, which is
more complicated in network structure yet with less inference complexity. The
core idea is to equip each original convolutional layer with another low-cost
collaborative layer (LCCL), and the element-wise multiplication of the ReLU
outputs of these two parallel layers produces the layer-wise output. The
combined layer is potentially more discriminative than the original
convolutional layer, and its inference is faster for two reasons: 1) the zero
cells of the LCCL feature maps will remain zero after element-wise
multiplication, and thus it is safe to skip the calculation of the
corresponding high-cost convolution in the original convolutional layer, 2)
LCCL is very fast if it is implemented as a 1*1 convolution or only a single
filter shared by all channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100

accelerate the inference process by 32\% on average with negligible performance

Here we report the intercalation of Cu into 2H-NbSe2 to make CuxNbSe2. As is
typically found when chemically altering an optimal superconductor, Tc
decreases with increasing x, but the way that Tc is suppressed in this case is
unusual - an S-shaped character is observed, with an inflection point near x =
0.03 and, at higher x, a leveling off of the Tc near 3 K - down to the usual
value for a layered TMDC. Electronic characterization reveals corresponding
S-like behavior for many of the materials parameters that influence Tc. To

Leveraging on the Bussgang decomposition, an exact achievable rate is derived
for the system with correlated quantization noise. Based on this, a closed-form
asymptotic approximation for the achievable rate is presented, thereby enabling
efficient evaluation of the impact of key parameters on the system performance.
Furthermore, power scaling laws are characterized to study the potential energy
efficiency associated with deploying massive one-bit antenna arrays at the
relay. In addition, a power allocation strategy is designed to compensate for
the rate degradation caused by the coarse quantization. Our results suggest
that the quality of the channel estimates depends on the specific orthogonal
pilot sequences that are used, contrary to unquantized systems where any set of
orthogonal pilot sequences gives the same result. Moreover, the sum rate gap
between the double-quantized relay system and an ideal non-quantized system is
a moderate factor of $4/\pi^2$ in the low power regime.

with as large an area as possible. We will find an upper bound, depending only
on $N$ and $r$, and not on the particular data presented, for the number of

have as large an area as possible, and this takes hardly any more time than

applied in many application domains, such as social community detection,
network visualization, and network topology analysis. Most of existing cohesive
subgraph metrics can guarantee good structural properties but may cause the
free-rider effect. Here, by free-rider effect, we mean that some irrelevant
subgraphs are combined as one subgraph if they only share a small number of
vertices and edges. In this paper, we study k-vertex connected component
(k-VCC) which can effectively eliminate the free-rider effect but less studied
in the literature. A k-VCC is a connected subgraph in which the removal of any
k-1 vertices will not disconnect the subgraph. In addition to eliminating the
free-rider effect, k-VCC also has other advantages such as bounded diameter,
high cohesiveness, bounded graph overlapping, and bounded subgraph number. We
propose a polynomial time algorithm to enumerate all k-VCCs of a graph by
recursively partitioning the graph into overlapped subgraphs. We find that the
key to improving the algorithm is reducing the number of local connectivity
testings. Therefore, we propose two effective optimization strategies, namely
neighbor sweep and group sweep, to largely reduce the number of local
connectivity testings. We conduct extensive performance studies using seven
large real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model as well as
the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

some hadronic-interaction models, can saturate the total flux. Such p+He model,
with small admixture of other light nuclei, naturally follows from cosmology
with recombination and reheating phases. The most radical assumption of the
presented model is the assumed unreliability of the experimental separation of
Helium and protons, which allows to consider He/p ratio as a free parameter.
The results presented here show that the models with dominant p+He composition
explain well the energy spectrum of the dip in the latest (2015 - 2017) data of

This corresponds to tiny Higgs portal coupling of dark matter as well as large

graph formed by a hole and a node that has at least 3 neighbors in the hole. In
this paper we obtain a decomposition theorem for the class of graphs that do
not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to a theta or a wheel, i.e. the
class of (theta, wheel)-free graphs. The decomposition theorem uses clique
cutsets and 2-joins. Clique cutsets are vertex cutsets that work really well in
decomposition based algorithms, but are unfortunately not general enough to
decompose more complex hereditary graph classes. A 2-join is an edge cutset
that appeared in decomposition theorems of several complex classes, such as
perfect graphs, even-hole-free graphs and others. In these decomposition
theorems 2-joins are used together with vertex cutsets that are more general
than clique cutsets, such as star cutsets and their generalizations (which are
much harder to use in algorithms). This is a first example of a decomposition
theorem that uses just the combination of clique cutsets and 2-joins. This has
several consequences. First, we can easily transform our decomposition theorem
into a complete structure theorem for (theta, wheel)-free graphs, i.e. we show
how every (theta, wheel)-free graph can be built starting from basic graphs
that can be explicitly constructed, and gluing them together by prescribed
composition operations; and all graphs built this way are (theta, wheel)-free.
Such structure theorems are very rare for hereditary graph classes, only a few
examples are known. Secondly, we obtain an $\mathcal O (n^4m)$-time
decomposition based recognition algorithm for (theta, wheel)-free graphs.
Finally, in Parts III and IV of this series, we give further applications of
our decomposition theorem.

one and the right-handed one, are adopted in the LCSR calculation. The
resultant LCSRs for the $B \to K^*$ TFFs are arranged according to the twist
structure of the $K^*$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), whose
twist-2, twist-3 and twist-4 terms behave quite differently by using different
correlators. We observe that the twist-4 LCDAs, though generally small, shall
have sizable contributions to the TFFs $A_{1/2}$, $V$ and $T_1$, thus the
twist-4 terms should be kept for a sound prediction. We also observe that even
though different choices of the correlator lead to different LCSRs with
different twist contributions, the large correlation coefficients for most of
the TFFs indicate that the LCSRs for different correlators are close to each
order, not only for their values at the large recoil point $q^2=0$ but also for
their ascending trends in whole $q^2$-region. Such a high degree of correlation
is confirmed by their application to the branching fraction of the
semi-leptonic decay $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$. Thus, a proper choice of
correlator may inversely provide a chance for probing uncertain LCDAs, i.e. the
contributions from those LCDAs can be amplified to a certain degree via a
proper choice of correlator, thus amplifying the sensitivity of the TFFs, and
hence their related observables, to those LCDAs.

specific heat is observed at about 1.08 K which may either reflect an
antiferromagnetic transition of the system or a superconducting transition
arising from Al impurity. We would argue that this anomaly in low temperature
region may be the long sought antiferromagnetic transition in FeSe. Global
fitting in wide temperature region shows that the models with a single
contribution with isotropic s-wave, anisotropic s-wave, and d-wave gap all do
not work well, nor the two isotropic s-wave gaps. We then fit the data by a

conservation for the low temperature transition, we reach a conclusion that the

$k_z$. However, a third hole-like band ($\gamma$) is not observed, which is
expected around the zone center from band calculations and is common in
iron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalization
factor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in our
data is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can exist
without coherent quasiparticles in the $\gamma$ band. This may help resolve the
current controversy on the superconducting gap structure of FeS. Moreover, by
comparing the $\beta$ bandwidths of various iron chalcogenides, including FeS,

types, there often exist certain acute problems that make it difficult for PTS
to directly accommodate many common realistic programming features such as
general recursion, recursive types, effects (e.g., exceptions, references,
input/output), etc. In this paper, Applied Type System (ATS) is presented as a
framework for designing and formalizing type systems in support of practical
programming with advanced types (including dependent types). In particular, it
is demonstrated that ATS can readily accommodate a paradigm referred to as
programming with theorem-proving (PwTP) in which programs and proofs are
constructed in a syntactically intertwined manner, yielding a practical
approach to internalizing constraint-solving needed during type-checking. The
key salient feature of ATS lies in a complete separation between statics, where
types are formed and reasoned about, and dynamics, where programs are
constructed and evaluated. With this separation, it is no longer possible for a
program to occur in a type as is otherwise allowed in PTS. The paper contains
not only a formal development of ATS but also some examples taken from
ats-lang.org, a programming language with a type system rooted in ATS, in

of great importance to quantum information processing as it relates to quantum

quantum system will unavoidably suffer from decoherence. Here, we investigate
the dynamic behaviors of the entropic uncertainty relation of an atom-cavity
interacting system under a bosonic reservoir during the crossover between
Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Specifically, we explore the dynamic
behavior of the entropic uncertainty relation for a pair of incompatible
observables under the reservoir-induced atomic decay effect both with and
without quantum memory. We find that the uncertainty dramatically depends on
both the atom-cavity and the cavity-reservoir interactions, as well as the
correlation time, $\tau$, of the structured reservoir. Furthermore, we verify
that the uncertainty is anti-correlated with the purity of the state of the
observed qubit-system. We also propose a remarkably simple and efficient way to
reduce the uncertainty by utilizing quantum weak measurement reversal.
Therefore our work offers a new insight into the uncertainty dynamics for

observations of Abell 194 obtained with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). We
use the SRT data in combination with archival Very Large Array observations to
derive both the spectral aging and Rotation Measure (RM) images of the radio
galaxies 3C40A and 3C40B embedded in Abell 194. The optical analysis indicates
that Abell 194 does not show a major and recent cluster merger, but rather
agrees with a scenario of accretion of small groups. Under the minimum energy
assumption, the lifetimes of synchrotron electrons in 3C40B measured from the
spectral break are found to be 157 Myrs. The break frequency image and the
electron density profile inferred from the X-ray emission are used in
combination with the RM data to constrain the intra-cluster magnetic field
power spectrum. By assuming a Kolmogorov power law power spectrum, we find that
the RM data in Abell 194 are well described by a magnetic field with a maximum
scale of fluctuations of Lambda_max=64 kpc and a central magnetic field
strength of <B0>=1.5 microG. Further out, the field decreases with the radius
following the gas density to the power of eta=1.1. Comparing Abell 194 with a
small sample of galaxy clusters, there is a hint of a trend between central
electron densities and magnetic field strengths.

X-ray luminous at fixed mass. Hence, our X-ray flux-limited sample, compared to

investigate magnetism in binary compounds CaN and CaAs. Regarding the structure
of analogous magnetic materials and experimental results of CaAs synthesis, we
have considered two cubic structures: rocksalt (RS) and zincblende (ZB), and
four hexagonal structures: NiAs, wurtzite (WZ), anti-NiAs, and NaO. The
calculated results show that CaN in cubic, NiAs, and wurtzite structures, and
CaAs only in zincblende phase have ferromagnetic ground states with a magnetic
moment of $1\mu _B$. Electronic structure analysis of these materials indicates
that magnetism originates from anion $p$ states. Existence of flat $p$ bands
and consequently high density of states at the Fermi level of magnetic
structures gives rise to Stoner spin splitting and spontaneous ferromagnetism.

Programmers, however, spend a substantial amount of time interacting with
incomplete programs -- programs with holes, type inconsistencies and binding
inconsistencies -- using tools like program editors and live programming
environments (which interleave editing and evaluation). Semanticists have done
comparatively little to formally characterize (1) the static and dynamic
semantics of incomplete programs; (2) the actions available to programmers as
they edit and inspect incomplete programs; and (3) the behavior of editor
services that suggest likely edit actions to the programmer based on semantic
information extracted from the incomplete program being edited, and from
programs that the system has encountered in the past. As such, each tool
designer has largely been left to develop their own ad hoc heuristics.
  This paper serves as a vision statement for a research program that seeks to
develop these ""missing"" semantic foundations. Our hope is that these
contributions, which will take the form of a series of simple formal calculi
equipped with a tractable metatheory, will guide the design of a variety of

principles in the design of Hazel, an experimental live lab notebook

the Hazel language with the editor so that we can explore concepts such as
edit-time semantic conflict resolution mechanisms and mechanisms that allow
library providers to install library-specific editor services.

the median is the same concept but when the distance is measured by the $L_1$
norm. These two predictors stem from the fact that the mean and the median,

happens that an interesting {\it logarithmic distance} can be defined on the
cone of strictly positive vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in such a way that the
minimizer of the distance to a collection of points is their geometric mean.\\
This distance on the base space leads to an interesting distance on the class
of strictly positive random variables, which in turn leads to an interesting
class of best predictors predictors and their estimators, as well as a
corresponding notion of conditional expectation. The appropriate version of the
Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, can also be obtained. We

language processing (NLP) can be used efficiently for patient phenotyping.
Patient phenotyping is a classification task for determining whether a patient
has a medical condition, and is a crucial part of secondary analysis of
healthcare data. We assess the performance of deep learning algorithms and
compare them with classical NLP approaches.
  Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
n-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical
concepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The
performance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge
summaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.
  Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks. The
average F1-score of our model is 76 (PPV of 83, and sensitivity of 71) with our
model having an F1-score up to 37 points higher than alternative approaches. We
additionally assess the interpretability of our model by presenting a method
that extracts the most salient phrases for a particular prediction.
  Conclusion: We show that NLP methods based on deep learning improve the
performance of patient phenotyping. Our CNN-based algorithm automatically
learns the phrases associated with each patient phenotype. As such, it reduces
the annotation complexity for clinical domain experts, who are normally
required to develop task-specific annotation rules and identify relevant
phrases. Our method performs well in terms of both performance and
interpretability, which indicates that deep learning is an effective approach
to patient phenotyping based on clinicians' notes.

all points of the process. However, if each point of this process is removed
with probability $p$ from either of the two lines, independently of the other
points, then the walk almost surely visits all points. Moreover, the greedy
walk on two parallel lines, where each line has a copy of the same realisation
of a homogeneous Poisson point process, but one copy is shifted by some small
$s$, almost surely visits all points.

the relationship between the processing conditions, microstructure and

Monte Carlo (KMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to predict the
microstructure evolution during the carbonization process of carbon fiber
manufacturing. The model accurately predicts the cross-sectional microstructure
of carbon fibers, predicting features such as graphitic sheets and hairpin
structures that have been observed experimentally. We predict the transverse
modulus of the resulting fibers and find that the modulus is slightly lower
than experimental values, but is up to an order of magnitude lower than ideal
graphite. We attribute this to the perfect longitudinal texture of our
simulated structures, as well as the chain sliding mechanism that governs the
deformation of the fibers, rather than the van der Waals interaction that
governs the modulus for graphite. We also observe that high reaction rates
result in porous structures that have lower moduli.

Engel and Sabre Kais","Accessing dark states optically through excitation-ferrying states",,,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.bio-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The efficiency of solar energy harvesting systems is largely determined by
their ability to transfer excitations from the antenna to the energy trapping
center before recombination. Dark state protection, achieved by coherent
coupling between subunits in the antenna structure, can significantly reduce
radiative recombination and enhance the efficiency of energy trapping. Because
the dark states cannot be populated by optical transitions from the ground
state, they are usually accessed through phononic relaxation from the bright
states. In this study, we explore a novel way of connecting the dark states and
the bright states via optical transitions. In a ring-like chromophore system
inspired by natural photosynthetic antennae, the single-excitation bright state
can be optically connected to the lowest energy single-excitation dark state
through certain double-excitation states. We call such double-excitation states
the ferry states and show that they are the result of accidental degeneracy
between two categories of double-excitation states. We then mathematically
prove that the ferry states are only available when N, the number of subunits
on the ring, satisfies N=4l+2 (l being an integer). Numerical calculations
confirm that the ferry states enhance the energy transfer power of our model,
showing a significant energy transfer power spike at N=6 compared with smaller
N values, even without phononic relaxation. The proposed mathematical theory
for the ferry states is not restricted to this one particular system or
numerical model. In fact, it is potentially applicable to any coherent optical
system that adopts a ring-shaped chromophore arrangement. Beyond the ideal
case, the ferry state mechanism also demonstrates robustness under weak
phononic dissipation, weak site energy disorder, and large coupling strength
disorder.

frames. We solve the problem of the generalized Sagnac effect in the standard
synchronization of clocks. The speed of a light beam that traverses an optical
fiber loop is measured with respect to the proper time of the light detector,
and is shown to be other than the constant c, though it appears to be c if
measured by the time standard-synchronized. The fiber loop, which can have an
arbitrary shape, is described by an infinite number of straight lines such that
it can be handled by the general framework of Mansouri and Sexl (MS). For a
complete analysis of the Sagnac effect, the motion of the laboratory should be
taken into account. The MS framework is introduced to deal with its motion
relative to a preferred reference frame. Though the one-way speed of light is
other than c, its two-way speed is shown to be c with respect to the proper
time. The theoretical analysis of the generalized Sagnac effect corresponds to
the experimental results, and shows the usefulness of the standard
synchronization. The introduction of the standard synchrony can make
mathematical manipulation easy and can allow us to deal with relative motions
between inertial frames without information on their velocities relative to the
preferred frame.

polymer or Edwards measure for fractional Brownian motion in dimension
$d\in\mathbb{N}$ with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$ fulfilling $dH < 1$. We make
use of a construction of the diffusion via Dirichlet form techniques in
infinite dimensional (Gaussian) analysis. By providing a Fukushima
decomposition for the stochastic quantization of the fractional Edwards measure
we prove that the constructed process solves weakly a stochastic differential
equation in infinite dimension for quasi-all starting points. Moreover, the
solution process is driven by an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process taking values in
an infinite dimensional distribution space and is unique, in the sense that the
underlying Dirichlet form is Markov unique. The equilibrium measure, which is
by construction the fractional Edwards measure, is specified to be an extremal
Gibbs state and therefore, the constructed stochastic dynamics is time ergodic.
The studied stochastic differential equation provides in the language of
polymer physics the dynamics of the bonds, i.e. stochastically spoken the noise
of the process. An integration leads then to polymer paths. We show that if one
starts with a continuous polymer configuration the integrated process stays
almost surely continuous during the time evolution.
