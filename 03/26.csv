machines. This tedious task is time consuming and prone to errors due to
fatigue of human annotators. The goal is to have a system that takes as input
an image and returns a count of the objects inside and justification for the
prediction in the form of object localization. We repose a problem, originally
posed by Lempitsky and Zisserman, to instead predict a count map which contains
redundant counts based on the receptive field of a smaller regression network.
The regression network predicts a count of the objects that exist inside this
frame. By processing the image in a fully convolutional way each pixel is going
to be accounted for some number of times, the number of windows which include
it, which is the size of each window, (i.e., 32x32 = 1024). To recover the true
count we take the average over the redundant predictions. Our contribution is
redundant counting instead of predicting a density map in order to average over
errors. We also propose a novel deep neural network architecture adapted from
the Inception family of networks called the Count-ception network. Together our
approach results in a 20% relative improvement (2.9 to 2.3 MAE) over the state

nanomanipulation of the AFM tip can be used to assemble 3D plasmonic

successfully assembled with nanometer precision, the relevant 3D plasmonic

exploit the fundamental understanding of various electromagnetic 3D couplings

therefore, they offer a way to handle the unobserved heterogeneity between

one latent class is required to capture the observed variable distribution.
Therefore, a GMM with continuous non-elliptical distributions is proposed to
capture skewness and heavier tails in the data set. Specifically, multivariate
skew-t distributions and generalized hyperbolic distributions are introduced to
extend GMMs. When extending GMMs, four statistical models are considered with
differing distributions of measurement errors and random effects. The

We verify the results of R\'enyi entropy by two different replica methods. We

exploit the results of relative entropy to yield the lower and upper bounds on
trace distance of the excited-state and thermal-state reduced density matrices.
Our results are consistent with subsystem weak ETH, which requires the above

non-negligible CCP feedbacks. Over the land, where the GCM results are not
conclusive, our findings are supported by atmospheric boundary layer models. A
simplified radiative model further suggests that such shifts may in turn cause
reduced reflection of solar radiation, thus inducing a positive feedback on
climate. The crucial role of the cloud cycle calls for increased attention to
the temporal evolution of the cloud diurnal cycle in climate models.

is defined to be the join of a clique and a regular graph. A wheel graph
obtained from the join of a complete graph on a vertex with a cycle. A question
about when wheel graphs are determined by their adjacency spectra is still
unsolved. So, any indication about the determinations of these graphs with
respect to their adjacency spectra can be an interesting and important problem.
In [Y. Zhang, X. Liu, and X. Yong: Which wheel graphs are determined by their

natural generalization of wheel graphs and we show that these graphs are
determined by their adjacency spectra as well as their Laplacian spectra. Also,
we show that complement of some of these graphs are determined by their

programs (SDP). While SDPs are solvable in polynomial time using interior point
methods, in practice generic SDP solvers do not scale well to high-dimensional
problems. In order to cope with this problem, Burer and Monteiro proposed a
non-convex rank-constrained formulation, which has good performance in practice
but is still poorly understood theoretically.
  In this paper we study the rank-constrained version of SDPs arising in MaxCut
and in synchronization problems. We establish a Grothendieck-type inequality
that proves that all the local maxima and dangerous saddle points are within a
small multiplicative gap from the global maximum. We use this structural
information to prove that SDPs can be solved within a known accuracy, by
applying the Riemannian trust-region method to this non-convex problem, while
constraining the rank to be of order one. For the MaxCut problem, our
inequality implies that any local maximizer of the rank-constrained SDP
provides a $ (1 - 1/(k-1)) \times 0.878$ approximation of the MaxCut, when the
rank is fixed to $k$.
  We then apply our results to data matrices generated according to the
Gaussian ${\mathbb Z}_2$ synchronization problem, and the two-groups stochastic
block model with large bounded degree. We prove that the error achieved by
local maximizers undergoes a phase transition at the same threshold as for
information-theoretically optimal methods.

cluster these patients into similar groups to help identify those with similar

compares very favorably to other methods via simulation of problems of this

likely, while only four test scores had high (>0.5) posterior probability of

  https://library2.um.edu.mo/etheses/b33358400_ft.pdf",,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Machine translation (MT) was developed as one of the hottest research topics
in the natural language processing (NLP) literature. One important issue in MT
is that how to evaluate the MT system reasonably and tell us whether the
translation system makes an improvement or not. The traditional manual judgment
methods are expensive, time-consuming, unrepeatable, and sometimes with low
agreement. On the other hand, the popular automatic MT evaluation methods have
some weaknesses. Firstly, they tend to perform well on the language pairs with
English as the target language, but weak when English is used as source.
Secondly, some methods rely on many additional linguistic features to achieve
good performance, which makes the metric unable to replicate and apply to other
language pairs easily. Thirdly, some popular metrics utilize incomprehensive
factors, which result in low performance on some practical tasks. In this
thesis, to address the existing problems, we design novel MT evaluation methods
and investigate their performances on different languages. Firstly, we design
augmented factors to yield highly accurate evaluation. Secondly, we design a
tunable evaluation model where weighting of factors can be optimized according
to the characteristics of languages. Thirdly, in the enhanced version of our
methods, we design concise linguistic feature using part-of-speech (POS) to
show that our methods can yield even higher performance when using some
external linguistic resources. Finally, we introduce the practical performance
of our metrics in the ACL-WMT workshop shared tasks, which show that the
proposed methods are robust across different languages. In addition, we also
present some novel work on quality estimation of MT without using reference
translations including the usage of probability models of Na\""ive Bayes (NB),
support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms, and CRFs.

quantum mechanics theories with vector or matrix large $N$ limits (on the
boundary) and weakly coupled gauge theories on a fixed $AdS_2$ background (in
the bulk). The boundary theories can be embedded as 1d sectors of 3d ${\cal N}
= 4$ superconformal field theories with holographic duals, from which they can
be obtained using supersymmetric localization. We study a few examples of such
1d theories: theories with vector large $N$ limits that are embedded into 3d
theories of many free massless hypermultiplets with $AdS_4$ higher spin duals;
and a 1d theory with a matrix large $N$ limit embedded into the 3d ABJM theory
at Chern-Simons level $k=1$, which has an $AdS_4$ supergravity dual. We propose
that the $U(N)$ singlet sectors of the 1d vector models are dual to 2d gauge
theories on $AdS_2$ whose gauge algebras are finite dimensional and whose full
non-linear actions we completely determine in some cases. The 1d theory
embedded into ABJM theory has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant sector dual to a 2d
gauge theory on $AdS_2$ whose gauge algebra is the infinite dimensional algebra
of area preserving diffeomorphisms of a two-sphere. We provide evidence that
the 2d gauge theories on $AdS_2$ can be obtained from localizing the $AdS_4$
duals of the 3d SCFTs mentioned above, and thus argue that our 2d/1d dualities
can be obtained via supersymmetric localization on both sides of their parent
$AdS_4$/CFT$_3$ dualities. We discuss the boundary terms required by
holographic renormalization in the 2d gauge theories on $AdS_2$ and show how
they arise from supersymmetric localization.

Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemics on networks. We consider a
population game framework where nodes choose whether or not to vaccinate
themselves, and the epidemic risk is defined as the infection probability at
the endemic state of the epidemic under a degree-based mean-field
approximation. Motivated by studies in behavioral economics showing that humans
perceive probabilities and risks in a nonlinear fashion, we specifically
examine the impacts of such misperceptions on the Nash equilibrium protection
strategies. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of a threshold
equilibrium where nodes with degrees larger than a certain threshold vaccinate.
When the vaccination cost is sufficiently high, we show that behavioral biases
cause fewer players to vaccinate, and vice versa. We quantify this effect for a
class of networks with power-law degree distributions by proving tight bounds
on the ratio of equilibrium thresholds under behavioral and true perceptions of
probabilities. We further characterize the socially optimal vaccination policy
and investigate the inefficiency of Nash equilibrium.

observation of an interfacial region at the Pt/YIG interface, we place a limit
on the induced magnetism of the Pt layer and confirm the existence of an
interfacial layer at the GGG/YIG interface. Polarised neutron reflectometry
(PNR) was used to give depth dependence of both the structure and magnetism of
these structures. We find that a thin film of YIG on GGG is best described by
three distinct layers: an interfacial layer near the GGG, around 5 nm thick and
non-magnetic, a magnetic bulk phase, and a non-magnetic and compositionally
distinct thin layer near the surface. We theorise that the bottom layer, which
is independent of the film thickness, is caused by Gd diffusion. The top layer
is likely to be extremely important in inverse spin Hall effect measurements,
and is most likely Y2O3 or very similar. Magnetic sensitivity in the PNR to any
induced moment in the Pt is increased by the existence of the Y2O3 layer; any

can withstand high temperature up to 2000K. Besides high stability, C3N is
predicted to be a superior stiff material with high Young's modulus (1090.0

roll-up C3N nanosheet into the corresponding nanotube, an out-of-plane bending
deformation is also investigated. The calculation indicates C3N nanosheet
possesses a fascinating bending Poisson's effect, namely, bending induced

nanotubes also present high Young's modulus and semiconducting properties. In
addition, the electronic properties of few-layer C3N nanosheet is also
investigated. It is predicated that C3N monolayer is an indirect semiconductor

autonomously sense, com- pute, and respond using energy-coupled ratchets that

proteins and motors, is a canonical example of biological active matter, which
is responsible for cargo transport, cell motility, division, and morphol- ogy.
Prior work on cytoskeletal active matter systems showed either extensile or
contractile dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a cytoskeletal system that can
control the direction of the network dynamics to be either extensile,
contractile, or static depending on the concentration of filaments or transient
crosslinkers through systematic variation of the crosslinker or micro- tubule
concentrations. Based off these new observations and our previously published
results, we created a simple one-dimensional model of the interaction of
filaments within a bundle. Despite its simplicity, our model recapitulates the
observed activities of our experimental sys- tem, implying that the dynamics of
our finite networks of bundles are driven by the local filament-filament
interactions within the bundle. Finally, we show that contractile phases can
result in autonomously motile networks that resemble cells. Our experiments and
model allow us to gain a deeper understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics and
provide a stepping stone for designing active, autonomous systems that could
potentially dynamically switch states.

sparse signal recovery with partial orthogonal sensing matrices. In this paper,
we extend the Turbo-CS algorithm to solve compressed sensing problems involving
more general signal structure, including compressive image recovery and
low-rank matrix recovery. A main difficulty for such an extension is that the
original Turbo-CS algorithm requires prior knowledge of the signal distribution
that is usually unavailable in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we
propose to redesign the Turbo-CS algorithm by employing a generic denoiser that
does not depend on the prior distribution and hence the name denoising-based
Turbo-CS (D-Turbo-CS). We then derive the extrinsic information for a generic
denoiser by following the Turbo-CS principle. Based on that, we optimize the
parametric extrinsic denoisers to minimize the output mean-square error (MSE).
Explicit expressions are derived for the extrinsic SURE-LET denoiser used in
compressive image denoising and also for the singular value thresholding (SVT)
denoiser used in low-rank matrix denoising. We find that the dynamics of
D-Turbo-CS can be well described by a scaler recursion called MSE evolution,
similar to the case for Turbo-CS. Numerical results demonstrate that D-Turbo-CS
considerably outperforms the counterpart algorithms in both reconstruction
quality and running time.

2015, the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the
network's flooding mechanism to a different protocol, known as diffusion.
However, no systematic justification was provided for the change, and it is
unclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper,
we model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties,

nonparametric forests---ensembles of decision trees, and learn the ensemble
parameters and the trees in a unified optimization problem within the
large-margin framework. In this fashion, we easily achieve nonlinear learning
of potential functions on both unary and pairwise terms in CRFs. Moreover, we
learn class-wise decision trees for each object that appears in the image. Due
to the rich structure and flexibility of decision trees, our approach is
powerful in modelling complex data likelihoods and label relationships. The
resulting optimization problem is very challenging because it can have
exponentially many variables and constraints. We show that this challenging

  Chest X-rays","10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ICCV 2017",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the most commonly prescribed medical imaging
procedures, often with over 2-10x more scans than other imaging modalities such
as MRI, CT scan, and PET scans. These voluminous CXR scans place significant
workloads on radiologists and medical practitioners. Organ segmentation is a
crucial step to obtain effective computer-aided detection on CXR. In this work,
we propose Structure Correcting Adversarial Network (SCAN) to segment lung
fields and the heart in CXR images. SCAN incorporates a critic network to
impose on the convolutional segmentation network the structural regularities
emerging from human physiology. During training, the critic network learns to
discriminate between the ground truth organ annotations from the masks
synthesized by the segmentation network. Through this adversarial process the
critic network learns the higher order structures and guides the segmentation
model to achieve realistic segmentation outcomes. Extensive experiments show
that our method produces highly accurate and natural segmentation. Using only
very limited training data available, our model reaches human-level performance
without relying on any existing trained model or dataset. Our method also
generalizes well to CXR images from a different patient population and disease
profiles, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

on top of a kink instability in lengthening current-carrying magnetic flux
tubes. Observations indicate that the dynamics of magnetic flux tubes in our
cosmos and terrestrial experiments can involve topological changes faster than
time scales predicted by resistive magnetohydrodynamics. Recent laboratory
experiments suggest that hierarchies of instabilities, such as kink and
Rayleigh-Taylor, could be responsible for initiating fast topological changes
by locally accessing two fluid and kinetic regimes. Sausage instabilities can
also provide this coupling mechanism between disparate scales. Flux tube
experiments can be classified by the flux tube's evolution in a configuration
space described by a normalized inverse aspect-ratio $\bar{k}$ and
current-to-magnetic flux ratio $\bar{\lambda}$. A lengthening current-carrying
magnetic flux tube traverses this $\bar{k}$ - $\bar{\lambda}$ space and crosses
stability boundaries. We derive a single general criterion for the onset of the
sausage and kink instabilities in idealized magnetic flux tubes with core and
skin currents. The criterion indicates a dependence of the stability boundaries
on current profiles and shows overlapping kink and sausage unstable regions in
the $\bar{k}$ - $\bar{\lambda}$ space with two free parameters. Numerical
investigation of the stability criterion reduces the number of free parameters
to a single one that describes the current profile, and confirms the
overlapping sausage and kink unstable regions in $\bar{k}$ - $\bar{\lambda}$
space. A lengthening, ideal current-carrying magnetic flux tube can therefore
become sausage unstable after it becomes kink unstable.

that is, for a multivariate observation, its output response lies on a

of grossly corrupted manifold-valued responses, a bottleneck issue commonly
encountered in practical scenarios. Our model first takes a correction step on
the grossly corrupted responses via geodesic curves on the manifold, and then
performs multivariate linear regression on the corrected data. This results in
a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem on manifolds. To this end, we
propose a dedicated approach named PALMR, by utilizing and extending the
proximal alternating linearized minimization techniques. Theoretically, we
investigate its convergence property, where it is shown to converge to a
critical point under mild conditions. Empirically, we test our model on both
synthetic and real diffusion tensor imaging data, and show that our model
outperforms other multivariate regression models when manifold-valued responses
contain gross errors, and is effective in identifying gross errors.

labeling a small fraction of the data and each data point being labeled by
several experts. This reduces the workload on individual experts and also gives
a better estimate of the unobserved ground truth. When experts disagree, the
standard approaches are to treat the majority opinion as the correct label or
to model the correct label as a distribution. These approaches, however, do not
make any use of potentially valuable information about which expert produced
which label. To make use of this extra information, we propose modeling the
experts individually and then learning averaging weights for combining them,
possibly in sample-specific ways. This allows us to give more weight to more
reliable experts and take advantage of the unique strengths of individual
experts at classifying certain types of data. Here we show that our approach
leads to improvements in computer-aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. We
also show that our method performs better than competing algorithms by Welinder

(a.k.a. assortative mixing) in their social ties, which implies that they
prefer bonding with others of their own kind. But what are the reasons for this
phenomenon? Is it that such relations are more convenient and easier to
maintain? Or are there also some more tangible benefits to be gained from this
collective behaviour?
  The current work takes a game-theoretic perspective on this phenomenon, and
studies the conditions under which different assortative mixing strategies lead
to equilibrium in an evolving social network. We focus on a biased preferential
attachment model where the strategy of each group (e.g., political or social
minority) determines the level of bias of its members toward other group
members and non-members. Our first result is that if the utility function that
the group attempts to maximize is the degree centrality of the group,
interpreted as the sum of degrees of the group members in the network, then the
only strategy achieving Nash equilibrium is a perfect homophily, which implies
that cooperation with other groups is harmful to this utility function. A
second, and perhaps more surprising, result is that if a reward for inter-group
cooperation is added to the utility function (e.g., externally enforced by an
authority as a regulation), then there are only two possible equilibria,
namely, perfect homophily or perfect heterophily, and it is possible to
characterize their feasibility spaces. Interestingly, these results hold
regardless of the minority-majority ratio in the population.
  We believe that these results, as well as the game-theoretic perspective
presented herein, may contribute to a better understanding of the forces that
shape the groups and communities of our society.

observed in the $\pi^{\pm}\psi(3686)$ invariant mass spectrum for data at
$\sqrt{s} = 4.416~$GeV. A fit with an $S$-wave Breit-Wigner function yields a
mass $M=4032.1\pm2.4$~$MeV$^{2}$, where the errors are statistical only.
However, there are still unresolved discrepancies between the fit model and
data. The width of the intermediate state varies in a wide range for different
kinematic regions within the data set. Therefore no simple interpretation of
the data has been found, and a future data sample with larger statistics and
more theoretical input will be required to better understand this issue.

sector radiatively mediate the flavor violation to the quark sector around the
TeV scale and effectively realize the observed CKM matrix. The lightest
particle in the hidden sector, whose contribution to the CKM matrix is expected
to be dominant, is a good dark matter (DM) candidate, so we focus on the

explicit relation between the CKM matrix and flavor violating couplings, such
as four-quark couplings, because both are radiatively induced by the particles
in the hidden sector. Then, we can explicitly find the DM mass region and the
size of Yukawa couplings between the DM and quarks, based on the study of
flavor physics and DM physics. In conclusion, we show that DM mass in our
scenario is around the TeV scale, and the Yukawa couplings are between ${\cal
O}(0.01)$ and ${\cal O}(1)$. The spin-independent DM scattering cross section

The improvement is achieved based on a known algorithm that constructs

showed that the single-dish sources are comprised of a blend of several
galaxies. Consequently, number counts derived from low and high angular
resolution observations are in disagreement. This demonstrates the importance
of resolution effects and the need to have realistic simulations to explore
them. We built a new 2deg^2 simulation of the extragalactic sky from the
far-infrared to the submillimeter. It is based on an updated version of the two
star-formation mode galaxy evolution model. Using global galaxy properties, we
use the abundance matching technique to populate a dark-matter lightcone and
thus simulate the clustering. We produce maps and extract the sources, and show
that the limited angular resolution of single-dish instruments have a strong
impact on (sub)millimeter continuum observations. Taking into account these
resolution effects, we are reproducing a large set of observables, including
number counts, redshift distributions, and cosmic infrared background power
spectra. Our simulation describes consistently the number counts from
single-dish telescopes and interferometers. In particular, at 350 and 500 um,
we find that number counts measured by Herschel between 5 and 50 mJy are biased
towards high values by a factor 2, and that redshift distributions are biased
towards low z. We also show that the clustering has an important impact on the
Herschel pixel histogram used to derive number counts from P(D) analysis.
Finally, we demonstrate that the large number density of red Herschel sources
found in observations but not in models could be an observational artifact
caused by the combination of noise, resolution effects, and the steepness of
color and flux density distributions. Our simulation (SIDES) is available at

bound by the non-detection of primordial gravitational waves. We show that the

the energy density of ALPs of mass smaller than $m_\chi$ is too low to explain

standard Gross-Neveu model -- the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory -- at three-loop
order, and compute critical exponents in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions for general
number of fermion flavors. Our results fully encompass the previously known
two-loop calculations, and agree with the known three-loop results in the
purely bosonic limit of the theory. We also find the exponents to satisfy the
emergent super-scaling relations in the limit of a single-component fermion,
order by order up to three loops. Finally, we apply the computed series for the
exponents and their Pad\'e approximants to several phase transitions of current
interest: metal-insulator transitions of spin-1/2 and spinless fermions on the
honeycomb lattice, emergent supersymmetric surface field theory in topological
phases, as well as the disorder-induced quantum transition in Weyl semimetals.

Since then
it has sparked much research in Geometric Group Theory. However, it is
notoriously hard to explicitly compute bounded cohomology, even for most basic
`non-positively curved' groups. On the other hand, there is a well-known
interpretation of ordinary group cohomology in dimension 2 and 3 in terms of
group extensions. The aim of this paper is to make this interpretation
available for bounded group cohomology. This will involve quasihomomorphisms as

$a(t)$ is assumed to obey the `background' Friedmann equation for a perfectly
homogeneous universe while particles move according to equations of motions
driven by the gravity of the density fluctuations. It has recently been
suggested that the emergence of structure modifies the evolution of $a(t)$ via
Newtonian (or `kinematic') backreaction and that this may avoid the need for
dark energy. Here we point out that the conventional system of equations is
exact in Newtonian gravity and there is no approximation in the use of the
homogeneous universe equation for $a(t)$. The recently proposed modification of
Racz et al.\ (2017) does not reduce to Newtonian gravity in the limit of low
velocities. We discuss the relation of this to the `generalised Friedmann
equation' of Buchert and Ehlers. These are quite different things; their
formula describes individual regions and is obtained under the restrictive
assumption that the matter behaves like a pressure-free fluid whereas our
result is exact for collisionless dynamics and is an auxiliary relation
appearing in the structure equations. We use the symmetry of the general
velocity autocorrelation function to show how Buchert's $\cal Q$ tends very
rapidly to zero for large volume and that this does not simply arise `by
construction' through the adoption of periodic boundary conditions as has been
claimed. We conclude that, to the extent that Newtonian gravity accurately
describes the low-$z$ universe, there is no backreaction of structure on $a(t)$
and that the need for dark energy cannot be avoided in this way.

a magnetic field, known as the Hofstadter butterfly, is determined by the
lattice geometry as well as the external field. Recent realizations of
artificial gauge fields and adjustable optical lattices in cold atom
experiments necessitate the consideration of these self-similar spectra for the
most general two-dimensional lattice. In a previous work, we investigated the
evolution of the spectrum for an experimentally realized lattice which was
tuned by changing the unit cell structure but keeping the square Bravais
lattice fixed. We now consider all possible Bravais lattices in two dimensions
and investigate the structure of the Hofstadter butterfly as the lattice is
deformed between lattices with different point symmetry groups. We model the
optical lattice by a sinusoidal real space potential and obtain the tight
binding model for any lattice geometry by calculating the Wannier functions. We
introduce the magnetic field via Peierls substitution and numerically calculate
the energy spectrum. The transition between the two most symmetric lattices,
i.e. the triangular and the square lattice displays the importance of bipartite
symmetry featuring deformation as well as closing of some of the major energy
gaps. The transition from the square to rectangular and from the triangular to
centered rectangular lattices are analyzed in terms of coupling of
one-dimensional chains. We calculate the Chern numbers of the major gaps and
Chern number transfer between bands during the transitions. We use gap Chern
numbers to identify distinct topological regions in the space of Bravais

  Models with Repairable Servers","48 pages; 9 figures",,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supermarket models are a class of interesting parallel queueing networks with
dynamic randomized load balancing and real-time resource management. When the
parallel servers are subject to breakdowns and repairs, analysis of such a
supermarket model becomes more difficult and challenging. In this paper, we
apply the mean-field theory to studying four interrelated supermarket models
with repairable servers, and numerically indicate impact of the different
repairman groups on performance of the systems. First, we set up the systems of
mean-field equations for the supermarket models with repairable servers. Then
we prove the asymptotic independence of the supermarket models through the
operator semi-group and the mean-field limit. Furthermore, we show that the
fixed points of the supermarket models satisfy the systems of nonlinear
equations. Finally, we use the fixed points to give numerical computation for
performer analysis, and provide valuable observations on model improvement.
Therefore, this paper provides a new and effective method in the study of
complex supermarket models.

planets remain poorly constrained and few of these systems have lower bounds on
the orbital distance of any massive outer planets. We infer a minimum orbital
distance and upper limits on the inclination of a hypothetical Jovian-mass
planet orbiting exterior to the six transiting planets at Kepler-11. Our
constraints are derived from dynamical models together with observations
provided by the Kepler mission. Firstly, the lack of transit timing variations
(TTV) in the outermost transiting planet Kepler-11 g imply that the system does
not contain a Jovian mass perturber within 2 AU from the star. Secondly, we
test under what initial conditions a Jovian-mass planet moderately inclined
from the transiting planets would make their co-transiting configuration
unlikely. The transiting planets are secularly coupled and exhibit small mutual
inclinations over long time-scales, although the outermost transiting planet,
Kepler-11 g is weakly coupled to the inner five. We rule out a Jovian-mass
planet on a 3 degree inclination within 3.0 AU, and higher inclinations out to
further orbital distances, unless an undetected planet exists orbiting in the
dynamical gap between Kepler-11 f and Kepler-11 g. Our constraints depend
little on whether we assume the six transiting planets of Kepler-11 were
initially perfectly co-planar or whether a minimum initial mutual inclination
between the transiting planets is adopted based on the measured impact
parameters of the transiting planets.

spacetime Weyl's transformations are at the core of a general relativistic,
conformally covariant scalar tensor theory aimed at the resolution of the most
intriguing enigma of modern Physics: the cosmological constant paradox
(hereafter: Lambda paradox. A Higgs mechanism within a spontaneous symmetry
breaking process offers formal connections, via an effective potential V(eff),
between some relevant properties of the elementary particles and the dark
energy content of the Universe. The nonintegrable application of the Weyl's
geometry leads to a Proca equation accounting for the dynamics of a
vector-meson proposed as an optimum candidate for Dark Matter. The average
vacuum-energy density in the Universe and the ""cosmological constant"" are
evaluated on the basis of the recent experimental data of the PLANCK Mission.
The resolution of the paradox is found for all exponential inflationary
potentials and is consistent with the experimental data. The result of the
theory: Lambda=6|V(eff)|shows that the paradox is determined by the algebraic
mismatch between two large counteracting functions of the scalar field
contributing to V(eff). The critical stability of the Universe is discussed.

  Intervention",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile
health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide
influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and
portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods
for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no
information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However,
data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online
learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides,
we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and
connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method
for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar
users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned
policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic
RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method
in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective
policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm
start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization
of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised
learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we
propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the
proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related
tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that
in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.
