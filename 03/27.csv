goal is to compute a function of these values in a distributed manner. In this
paper, we propose a novel token-based approach to compute a wide class of
target functions to which we refer as ""Token-based function Computation with
Memory"" (TCM) algorithm. In this approach, node values are attached to tokens
and travel across the network. Each pair of travelling tokens would coalesce
when they meet, forming a token with a new value as a function of the original
token values. In contrast to the Coalescing Random Walk (CRW) algorithm, where
token movement is governed by random walk, meeting of tokens in our scheme is
accelerated by adopting a novel chasing mechanism. We proved that, compared to
the CRW algorithm, the TCM algorithm results in a reduction of time complexity
by a factor of at least $\sqrt{n/\log(n)}$ in Erd\""os-Renyi and complete
graphs, and by a factor of $\log(n)/\log(\log(n))$ in torus networks.
Simulation results show that there is at least a constant factor improvement in
the message complexity of TCM algorithm in all considered topologies.
Robustness of the CRW and TCM algorithms in the presence of node failure is
analyzed. We show that their robustness can be improved by running multiple
instances of the algorithms in parallel.

images of the same person captured by different non-overlapping camera views
against significant and unknown cross-view feature distortion. While a large
number of distance metric/subspace learning models have been developed for
re-id, the cross-view transformations they learned are view-generic and thus
potentially less effective in quantifying the feature distortion inherent to
each camera view. Learning view-specific feature transformations for re-id
(i.e., view-specific re-id), an under-studied approach, becomes an alternative
resort for this problem. In this work, we formulate a novel view-specific
person re-identification framework from the feature augmentation point of view,
called Camera coRrelation Aware Feature augmenTation (CRAFT). Specifically,
CRAFT performs cross-view adaptation by automatically measuring camera
correlation from cross-view visual data distribution and adaptively conducting
feature augmentation to transform the original features into a new adaptive
space. Through our augmentation framework, view-generic learning algorithms can
be readily generalized to learn and optimize view-specific sub-models whilst
simultaneously modelling view-generic discrimination information. Therefore,
our framework not only inherits the strength of view-generic model learning but
also provides an effective way to take into account view specific
characteristics. Our CRAFT framework can be extended to jointly learn
view-specific feature transformations for person re-id across a large network
with more than two cameras, a largely under-investigated but realistic re-id
setting. Additionally, we present a domain-generic deep person appearance
representation which is designed particularly to be towards view invariant for
facilitating cross-view adaptation by CRAFT.

distributed $p$-dimensional random vectors into a $p \times n$ data matrix, we
investigate the problem of testing independence among columns under the
matrix-variate normal modeling of data. We propose a computationally simple and
tuning-free test statistic, characterize its limiting null distribution,
analyze the statistical power and prove its minimax optimality. As an important
by-product of the test statistic, a ratio-consistent estimator for the
quadratic functional of a covariance matrix from correlated samples is
developed. We further study the effect of correlation among samples to an
important high-dimensional inference problem --- large-scale multiple testing
of Pearson's correlation coefficients. Indeed, blindly using classical
inference results based on the assumed independence of samples will lead to
many false discoveries, which suggests the need for conducting independence
testing before applying existing methods. To address the challenge arising from
correlation among samples, we propose a ""sandwich estimator"" of Pearson's
correlation coefficient by de-correlating the samples. Based on this approach,
the resulting multiple testing procedure asymptotically controls the overall
false discovery rate at the nominal level while maintaining good statistical
power. Both simulated and real data experiments are carried out to demonstrate

forms have perfectly identical representations over $\mathbb{Z}$, they are
constant multiples of regular forms, or is included in either of two families
parametrized by $\mathbb{R}^2$ (so called, hexagonal and rhombohedral
families). Our results aim to clarify the limitations imposed to such a pair by
computational and theoretical approaches. Firstly, the result of an exhaustive
search for such pairs of integral quadratic forms is presented, in order to
provide a concrete version of the Kaplansky conjecture. The obtained list
contains a small number of non-regular forms that are confirmed to have the
identical representations up to 3,000,000, although a strong limitation on the
existence of such pairs is still observed, regardless of whether the
coefficient field is $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$. Secondly, we prove that if
two pairs of ternary quadratic forms have the identical simultaneous
representations over $\mathbb{Q}$, their constant multiples are equivalent over
$\mathbb{Q}$. This was motivated by the question why the other families were
not detected in the search. In the proof, the parametrization of quartic rings
and their resolvent rings by Bhargava is used to discuss pairs of ternary
quadratic forms.

of chiral anomaly in many-body systems of chiral fermions. A notable example is
the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). Enthusiastic efforts have been made to search
for the CME in the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions. A
crucial challenge is that the extremely strong magnetic field in such
collisions may last only for a brief moment and the CME current may have to
occur at so early a stage that the quark-gluon matter is still far from thermal
equilibrium. This thus requires modeling of the CME in an out-of-equilibrium
setting. With the recently developed theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory,
we make a first phenomenological study of the CME-induced charge separation
during the pre-thermal stage in heavy ion collisions. The effect is found to be
very sensitive to the time dependence of the magnetic field and also influenced
by the initial quark momentum spectrum as well as the relaxation time of the
system evolution toward thermal equilibrium. Within the present approach, such
pre-thermal charge separation is found to be modest.

variations of the quantum effective action in an arbitrary curved space
background field. All Conservation, Trace and Conformal Ward Identities (CWIs),
including contact terms, are completely fixed in this covariant approach. The
Trace and CWIs are anomalous. Their anomalous contributions may be computed
unambiguously by metric variation of the exact 1PI quantum effective action

specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it
is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms).
Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a
time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The
proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic
vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.

popular complex architectures, such as the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and

and vesicular topographies through nanoscale reorganization of lipids,
proteins, and carbohydrates. However, prior attempts to understand the initial
stages of nanoscale bending have been limited by experimental resolution.
Through the implementation of polarized localization microscopy (PLM), this
manuscript reports the inherent membrane bending capability of cholera toxin
subunit B (CTxB) in quasi-one component supported lipid bilayers. Membrane buds
were first detected with <50 nm radius, grew to >200 nm radius, and extended
into longer tubules with dependence on the membrane tension and CTxB
concentration. Compared to the concentration of the planar supported lipid
bilayers, CTxB was >10x more concentrated on the positive curvature top and
>25x more concentrated on the negative Gaussian curvature neck of the nanoscale
membrane buds. This finding elucidates prior observations by correlating CTxB
clustering and diffusion to CTxB-induced membrane bending. CTxB is frequently
used as a marker for liquid-ordered lipid phases; however, the coupling between
CTxB and membrane bending provides an alternate understanding of CTxB-induced
membrane reorganization. Single-particle tracking was performed on both lipids
and CTxB to reveal the correlation between single-molecule diffusion, CTxB
accumulation, and membrane topography. Slowed lipid and CTxB diffusion was
observed at the nanoscale buds locations, suggesting a local increase in
membrane viscosity or molecular crowding upon membrane bending. These results
suggest inherent CTxB-induced membrane bending as a mechanism for initiating
CTxB internalization in cells that is initially independent of clathrin,
caveolin, actin, and lipid phase separation.

G(M)$ of Riemannian metrics, which we call \emph{metrics of the gradient type}.
For such metrics $g$, the geodesic flow $v^g$ on the spherical tangent bundle
$SM \to M$ admits a Lyapunov function (so the $v^g$-flow is traversing). It
turns out, that metrics of the gradient type are exactly the non-trapping
metrics.
  For every $g \in \mathcal G(M)$, the geodesic scattering along the boundary
$\partial M$ can be expressed in terms of the \emph{scattering map} $C_{v^g}:
\partial_1^+(SM) \to \partial_1^-(SM)$. It acts from a domain
$\partial_1^+(SM)$ in the boundary $\partial(SM)$ to the complementary domain
$\partial_1^-(SM)$, both domains being diffeomorphic. We prove that, for a
\emph{boundary generic} metric $g \in \mathcal G(M)$ the map $C_{v^g}$ allows
for a reconstruction of $SM$ and of the geodesic foliation $\mathcal F(v^g)$ on
it, up to a homeomorphism (often a diffeomorphism).
  Also, for such $g$, the knowledge of the scattering map $C_{v^g}$ makes it
possible to recover the homology of $M$, the Gromov simplicial semi-norm on it,
and the fundamental group of $M$. Additionally, $C_{v^g}$ allows to reconstruct
the naturally stratified topological type of the space of geodesics on $M$.

lighter than the surrounding liquid. However, the growth of the foam free of
gravity effects is still very relevant, as it is connected to manufacturing in

Precise determination of stellar masses is necessary to test the
validity of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stellar evolutionary models, whose
predictions are in disagreement with measurements for masses below 1.2 Msun. To
improve such a test, and based on our previous studies, we selected the AB
Doradus moving group (AB Dor-MG) as the best-suited association on which to
apply radio-based high-precision astrometric techniques to study binary
systems. Aims. We seek to determine precise estimates of the masses of a set of
stars belonging to the AB Dor-MG using radio and infrared observations.
Methods. We observed in phase-reference mode with the Very Large Array (VLA) at
5 GHz and with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 8.4 GHz the stars HD 160934,
EK Dra, PW And, and LO Peg. We also observed some of these stars with the
near-infrared CCD AstraLux camera at the Calar Alto observatory to complement
the radio observations. Results. We determine model-independent dynamical
masses of both components of the star HD 160934, A and c, which are 0.70+/-0.07
Msun and 0.45+/-0.04 Msun , respectively. We revised the orbital parameters of
EK Dra and we determine a sum of the masses of the system of 1.38+/-0.08 Msun.
We also explored the binarity of the stars LO Peg and PW And. Conclusions. We
found observational evidence that PMS evolutionary models underpredict the mass
of PMS stars by 10%-40%, as previously reported by other authors. We also
inferred that the origin of the radio emission must be similar in all observed
stars, that is, extreme magnetic activity of the stellar corona that triggers
gyrosynchrotron emission from non-thermal, accelerated electrons.

learning (ZSL) aims at automatically recognizing the instances from unseen
object classes without training data. To address this problem, ZSL is usually
carried out in the following two aspects: 1) capturing the domain distribution
connections between seen classes data and unseen classes data; and 2) modeling
the semantic interactions between the image feature space and the label
embedding space. Motivated by these observations, we propose a bidirectional
mapping based semantic relationship modeling scheme that seeks for crossmodal
knowledge transfer by simultaneously projecting the image features and label
embeddings into a common latent space. Namely, we have a bidirectional
connection relationship that takes place from the image feature space to the
latent space as well as from the label embedding space to the latent space. To
deal with the domain shift problem, we further present a transductive learning
approach that formulates the class prediction problem in an iterative refining
process, where the object classification capacity is progressively reinforced
through bootstrapping-based model updating over highly reliable instances.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (AwA, CUB and SUN) demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art
approaches.

inferential capability to recognize instances of a new category that has never
seen before. Two fundamental challenges in it are visual-semantic embedding and
domain adaptation in cross-modality learning and unseen class prediction steps,
respectively. To address both challenges, this paper presents two corresponding
methods named Adaptive STructural Embedding (ASTE) and Self-PAsed Selective
Strategy (SPASS), respectively. Specifically, ASTE formulates the
visualsemantic interactions in a latent structural SVM framework to adaptively
adjust the slack variables to embody the different reliableness among training
instances. In this way, the reliable instances are imposed with small
punishments, wheras the less reliable instances are imposed with more severe
punishments. Thus, it ensures a more discriminative embedding. On the other
hand, SPASS offers a framework to alleviate the domain shift problem in ZSL,
which exploits the unseen data in an easy to hard fashion. Particularly, SPASS
borrows the idea from selfpaced learning by iteratively selecting the unseen
instances from reliable to less reliable to gradually adapt the knowledge from
the seen domain to the unseen domain. Subsequently, by combining SPASS and
ASTE, we present a self-paced Transductive ASTE (TASTE) method to progressively
reinforce the classification capacity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets (i.e., AwA, CUB, and aPY) demonstrate the superiorities of ASTE and
TASTE. Furthermore, we also propose a fast training (FT) strategy to improve
the efficiency of most of existing ZSL methods. The FT strategy is surprisingly
simple and general enough, which can speed up the training time of most
existing methods by 4~300 times while holding the previous performance.

optimization problems with nonuniform convex constraint sets and nonuniform
stepsizes for general differentiable convex objective functions. The
communication graphs are not required to be strongly connected at any time, the
gradients of the local objective functions are not required to be bounded when
their independent variables tend to infinity, and the constraint sets are not
required to be bounded. For continuous-time multi-agent systems, a distributed
continuous algorithm is first introduced where the stepsizes and the convex
constraint sets are both nonuniform. It is shown that all agents reach a
consensus while minimizing the team objective function even when the constraint
sets are unbounded. After that, the obtained results are extended to
discrete-time multi-agent systems and then the case where each agent remains in
a corresponding convex constraint set is studied. To ensure all agents to
remain in a bounded region, a switching mechanism is introduced in the
algorithms. It is shown that the distributed optimization problems can be
solved, even though the discretization of the algorithms might deviate the
convergence of the agents from the minimum of the objective functions. Finally,
numerical examples are included to show the obtained theoretical results.

that the potential execution orders of callbacks are missing from the apps'

have been found to be related to callback sequences. Existing work on control
flow analysis of Android apps have mainly focused on analyzing GUI events. GUI
events, although being a key part of determining control flow of Android apps,
do not offer a complete picture. Our observation is that orthogonal to GUI
events, the Android API calls also play an important role in determining the
order of callbacks. In the past, such control flow information has been modeled
manually. This paper presents a complementary solution of constructing program
paths for Android apps. We proposed a specification technique, called Predicate
Callback Summary (PCS), that represents the callback control flow information
(including callback sequences as well as the conditions under which the
callbacks are invoked) in Android API methods and developed static analysis
techniques to automatically compute and apply such summaries to construct apps'
callback sequences. Our experiments show that by applying PCSs, we are able to
construct Android apps' control flow graphs, including inter-callback
relations, and also to detect infeasible paths involving multiple callbacks.
Such control flow information can help program analysis and testing tools to
report more precise results. Our detailed experimental data is available at:

the first time. The fundamental idea is to replace the single excitation and

network of interconnected nano-devices that can simultaneously excite and

large number of nanosensors jointly and distributively collect the Raman

more importantly, proves its feasibility, by utilizing accurate models of

mass degeneracy between stop and neutralino plus top quark. Searching for such
a stop at the LHC is a challenge. On the other hand, in terms of the argument
of natural SUSY, other members in the stop sector, including a heavier stop
$\tilde{t}_2$ and lighter sbottom $\tilde{b}_1$ (both assumed to be

searching for them would provide an alternative method to probe natural SUSY

tolerates relatively heavy colored partners near the TeV scale, with a
moderately large mass gap between the heavier members and the lightest stop.
Then $W/Z/h$ as companions of $\tilde{t}_2$ and $\tilde{b}_1$ decaying into

concentration of the polymer CP, and the polymer-solvent interactions
{\epsilon}ij (i = A, B; j = S1, S2). Morphology diagrams are constructed as
functions of CP, CS2, and/or {\epsilon}AS2. The copolymer morphological
sequence from dissolved -> sphere -> rod-> ring/cage-> vesicle is obtained upon
increasing CS2 at a fixed CP. This morphology sequence is consistent with
previous experimental observations. It is found that the selectivity of the
selective solvent affects the self-assembled microstructure significantly. In
particular, when the interaction {\epsilon}BS2 is negative, aggregates of
stacked lamellae dominate the diagram. The mechanisms of aggregate
transformation and the formation of stacked lamellar aggregates are discussed
by analyzing variations of the average contact numbers of the A or B monomers
with monomers and with molecules of the two types of solvent, as well as the
mean square end-to-end distances of chains. It is found that the basic
morphological sequence of spheres to rods to vesicles and the stacked lamellar
aggregates result from competition between the interfacial energy and the chain
conformational entropy. Analysis of the vesicle structure reveals that the
vesicle size increases with increasing CP or with decreasing CS2, but remains
almost unchanged with variations in {\epsilon}AS2.

present a model of the dynamics of a {\it Culex quinquefasciatus} mosquito
population that incorporates the effect of rainfall and use it to study the
influence of the number of rainy days and the mean monthly precipitation on the
maximum yearly abundance of mosquitoes $M_{max}$. Additionally, using a
fracturing process, we investigate the influence of the variability in daily
rainfall on $M_{max}$. We find that, given a constant value of monthly
precipitation, there is an optimum number of rainy days for which $M_{max}$ is
a maximum. On the other hand, we show that increasing daily rainfall
variability reduces the dependence of $M_{max}$ on the number of rainy days,
leading also to a higher abundance of mosquitoes for the case of low mean
monthly precipitation. Finally, we explore the effect of the rainfall in the
months preceding the wettest season, and we obtain that a regimen with high
precipitations throughout the year and a higher variability tends to advance
slightly the time at which the peak mosquito abundance occurs, but could
significantly change the total mosquito abundance in a year.

was obtained over the output map space. Such a weighted SOM pattern of the
output changes when the input changes. In order to analyze the change, it is
important to measure the difference of the patterns. Many methods have been
proposed for the dissimilarity measure of patterns. However, it remains a major
challenge when attempting to measure how the patterns change. In this paper, we
propose a visualization approach that simplifies the comparison of the
difference in terms of the pattern property. Using this approach, the change
can be analyzed by integrating colors and star glyph shapes representing the
property dissimilarity. Ecological data is used to demonstrate the usefulness
of our approach and the experimental results show that our approach provides
the change information effectively.

based on an information-theoretic quantity, mutual information, and use it
successfully as a criterion to eliminate unnecessary hash table updates. Next,
we also show how to optimize the mutual information objective using stochastic

connectivity in multichannel brain physiological signals (e.g.,
electroencephalograms, local field potentials). The difficulties from analyzing
these data mainly come from two aspects: first, there are major statistical and
computational challenges for modeling and analyzing high dimensional
multichannel brain signals; second, there is no set of universally-agreed
measures for characterizing connectivity. To model multichannel brain signals,
our approach is to fit a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with potentially
high lag order so that complex lead-lag temporal dynamics between the channels
can be captured. Estimates of the VAR model will be obtained by our proposed
hybrid LASSLE (LASSO+LSE) method which combines regularization (to control for
sparsity) and least squares estimation (to improve bias and mean-squared
error). Then we employ some measures of connectivity but put an emphasis on
partial directed coherence (PDC) which can capture the directional connectivity
between channels. PDC is a frequency-specific measure that explains the extent
to which the present oscillatory activity in a sender channel influences the
future oscillatory activity in a specific receiver channel relative to all
possible receivers in the network. The proposed modeling approach provided key
insights into potential functional relationships among simultaneously recorded
sites during performance of a complex memory task. Specifically, this novel
method was successful in quantifying patterns of effective connectivity across
electrode locations, and in capturing how these patterns varied across trial
epochs and trial types.

This demands a detailed knowledge of the nuclear structure relevant for these

elements are very sensitive to the nuclear correlations in the initial and
final nuclei, and the spin-dependent nuclear structure factors of dark matter
scattering depend on the subtle distribution of the nuclear spin among all
nucleons. In addition, nucleons are composite and strongly interacting, which
implies that many-nucleon processes are necessary for a correct description of

a coupling to two nucleons, called two-nucleon currents.

$\mathcal{DDE}$ layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the

reorganizations of integrands into parts that are manifestly finite and parts
that have poor power counting but integrate to zero due to integral identities.
At two loops we find that in the large loop-momentum limit the required
integral identities follow from Lorentz and SL(2) relabeling symmetry. We carry
out a nontrivial check at four loops showing that the identities generated in
this way are a complete set. We propose that at $L$ loops the combination of
Lorentz and SL($L$) symmetry is sufficient for displaying enhanced
cancellations when they happen, whenever the theory is known to be ultraviolet
finite up to $(L-1)$ loops.

resource has to be divided among n agents with different valuations in a
proportional way --- giving each agent a piece with a value of at least 1/n of
the total. In many applications, such as dividing a land-estate or a
time-interval, it is also important that the pieces are connected. We propose
two additional requirements: resource-monotonicity (RM) and
population-monotonicity (PM). When either the cake or the set of agents changes
and the cake is re-divided using the same rule, the utility of all remaining
agents must change in the same direction.
  Classic cake-cutting protocols are neither RM nor PM. Moreover, we prove that
no Pareto-optimal proportional division rule can be either RM or PM. Motivated
by this negative result, we search for division rules that are
weakly-Pareto-optimal --- no other division is strictly better for all agents.
  We present two such rules. The relative-equitable rule, which assigns the
maximum possible relative value equal for all agents, is proportional and PM.
The so-called rightmost-mark rule, which is an improved version of the Cut and

match the short rise time, narrow light curve peak, and extremely broad
spectral lines of SN1998bw requires a model with <3Msun ejecta but a high
explosion energy of a few 1e52erg and 0.5Msun of Ni56. However the relatively
high luminosity, the presence of narrow spectral lines of intermediate mass
elements, and the low ionization at the nebular stage are matched with a more
standard C-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) star explosion, with an ejecta of >10Msun, an
explosion energy >1e51erg, and only 0.1Msun of Ni56. As the two models are
mutually exclusive, the breaking of spherical symmetry is essential to match
the early/late photometric/spectroscopic properties of SN1998bw. This
conclusion confirms the notion that the ejecta of SN1998bw is aspherical on
large scales. More generally, with asphericity, the energetics and Ni56 mass of
LGRB/SNe are reduced and their ejecta mass is increased, favoring a massive
fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet star progenitor. Contrary to persisting claims in
favor of the proto-magnetar model for LGRB/SNe, such progenitor/ejecta

variables and many tools and theorems are available for analysis of strictly
Boolean models. However, multilevel variables are often required to account for
threshold effects, in which knowledge of the Boolean case does not generalise
straightforwardly. This motivated the development of conversion methods for
multilevel to Boolean models. In particular, Van Ham's method has been shown to
yield a one-to-one, neighbour and regulation preserving dynamics, making it the
de facto standard approach to the problem. However, Van Ham's method has
several drawbacks: most notably, it introduces vast regions of ""non-admissible""
states that have no counterpart in the multilevel, original model. This raises
special difficulties for the analysis of interaction between variables and
circuit functionality, which is believed to be central to the understanding of
dynamic properties of logical models. Here, we propose a new multilevel to
Boolean conversion method, with software implementation. Contrary to Van Ham's,
our method doesn't yield a one-to-one transposition of multilevel trajectories,
however, it maps each and every Boolean state to a specific multilevel state,
thus getting rid of the non-admissible regions and, at the expense of
(apparently) more complicated, ""parallel"" trajectories. One of the prominent
features of our method is that it preserves dynamics and interaction of
variables in a certain manner. As a demonstration of the usability of our
method, we apply it to construct a new Boolean counter-example to the
well-known conjecture that a local negative circuit is necessary to generate
sustained oscillations. This result illustrates the general relevance of our
method for the study of multilevel logical models.

which has the capability of controlling the overall impedance of the
transmission line. However, the cost of the CVSR is about one tenth of a
similar rated FACTS device which potentially allows large numbers of devices to
be installed. The multi-stage TEP with the CVSR considering the $N-1$ security
constraints is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model. The
nonlinear part of the power flow introduced by the variable reactance is
linearized by a reformulation technique. To reduce the computational burden for
a practical large scale system, a decomposition approach is proposed. The
detailed simulation results on the IEEE 24-bus and a more practical Polish
2383-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, the
appropriately allocated CVSRs add flexibility to the TEP problem and allow
reduced planning costs. Although the proposed decomposition approach cannot
guarantee global optimality, a high level picture of how the network can be
planned reliably and economically considering CVSR is achieved.

one-dimensional (1D) dynamically modulated superlattices, both theoretically
and numerically. In contrast to conventional lattices with straight waveguides,
the quasi-energy band of infinite modulated superlattice is periodic not only
in the transverse Bloch momentum, but it also changes periodically with
increase of the coupling strength between waveguides. Due to collapse of
quasi-energy bands dynamical superlattices admit known dynamical localization
effect. If, however, such a lattice is truncated, periodic longitudinal
modulation leads to appearance of specific edge states that exist within
certain periodically spaced intervals of coupling constants. We discuss unusual
transport properties of such truncated superlattices and illustrate different
excitation regimes and enhanced robustness of edge states in them, that is
associated with topology of the quasi-energy band.

from an alphabet~$\Sigma$ is the minimum cost of transforming one tree into the
other by a sequence of elementary operations consisting of deleting and
relabeling existing nodes, as well as inserting new nodes. Tree edit distance
is a well known generalization of string edit distance. The fastest known
algorithm for tree edit distance runs in cubic $O(n^3)$ time and is based on a
similar dynamic programming solution as string edit distance. In this paper we
show that a truly subcubic $O(n^{3-\varepsilon})$ time algorithm for tree edit
distance is unlikely: For $|\Sigma| = \Omega(n)$, a truly subcubic algorithm
for tree edit distance implies a truly subcubic algorithm for the all pairs
shortest paths problem. For $|\Sigma| = O(1)$, a truly subcubic algorithm for
tree edit distance implies an $O(n^{k-\varepsilon})$ algorithm for finding a
maximum weight $k$-clique.
  Thus, while in terms of upper bounds string edit distance and tree edit
distance are highly related, in terms of lower bounds string edit distance
exhibits the hardness of the strong exponential time hypothesis [Backurs, Indyk

full-/half-duplex receiver deployment strategy is proposed to secure legitimate
transmissions, by letting a fraction of legitimate receivers work in the
full-duplex (FD) mode sending jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers upon
their information receptions, and letting the other receivers work in the
half-duplex mode just receiving their desired signals. The objective of this
paper is to choose properly the fraction of FD receivers for achieving the
optimal network security performance. Both accurate expressions and tractable
approximations for the connection outage probability and the secrecy outage
probability of an arbitrary legitimate link are derived, based on which the
area secure link number, network-wide secrecy throughput and network-wide
secrecy energy efficiency are optimized respectively. Various insights into the
optimal fraction are further developed and its closed-form expressions are also
derived under perfect self-interference cancellation or in a dense network. It
is concluded that the fraction of FD receivers triggers a non-trivial trade-off
between reliability and secrecy, and the proposed strategy can significantly
enhance the network security performance.

corresponding to the DAMA modulation if interpreted as due to dark matter
weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). First we show how a modulated
signal gives information on the WIMP velocity distribution function in the
Galactic rest frame, from which the unmodulated signal descends. Then we
perform a mathematically-sound profile likelihood analysis in which we profile
the likelihood over a continuum of nuisance parameters (namely, the WIMP
velocity distribution). As a first application of the method, which is very
general and valid for any class of velocity distributions, we restrict the
analysis to velocity distributions that are isotropic in the Galactic frame. In
this way we obtain halo-independent maximum-likelihood estimates and confidence
intervals for the DAMA unmodulated signal. We find that the estimated
unmodulated signal is in line with expectations for a WIMP-induced modulation
and is compatible with the DAMA background+signal rate. Specifically, for the
isotropic case we find that the modulated amplitude ranges between a few
percent and about 25% of the unmodulated amplitude, depending on the WIMP mass.

phylo-genetic methods, accounting for the possible differences between gene
histories and species histories. Reconciliation consists in explaining these
differences by gene-scale events such as duplication, loss, transfer, which
translates mathematically into a mapping between gene tree nodes and species
tree nodes or branches. Gene conversion is a very frequent biological event,
which results in the replacement of a gene by a copy of another from the same
species and in the same gene tree. Including this event in reconciliations has
never been attempted because this changes as well the solutions as the methods
to construct reconciliations. Standard algorithms based on dynamic programming
become ineffective. We propose here a novel mathematical framework including
gene conversion as an evolutionary event in gene tree/species tree
reconciliation. We describe a randomized algorithm giving in polynomial running
time a reconciliation minimizing the number of duplications, losses and
conversions. We show that the space of reconciliations includes an analog of
the Last Common Ancestor reconciliation, but is not limited to it. Our
algorithm outputs any optimal reconciliation with non null probability. We
argue that this study opens a wide research avenue on including gene conversion

experimental evidence for high-energy series of exciton transitions, which

bands demonstrating a pronounced size effect are observed for CdTe, CdSe, and
CdS NPLs in addition to the $E_0$ exciton bands in the visible region. These
new bands are attributed to transitions analogous to the $E_1$, $E_1+\Delta_1$,

of the electronic structure and absorption spectra support this explanation and
show that the main contribution to these optical transitions comes from $X$ and
$M$ points of the 2D BZ, which originate from $L$ and $X$ points of the 3D BZ.
At the same time, the $E_0$ series of transitions at the $\Gamma$ point is well
described by the multiband effective-mass model. The observation of the UV

dot-phonon coupling is discussed within non-Markovian regime beyond Born

carried out with respect to the phonon interaction and compared with the non-

because the discriminator network learns the structure in line drawings, it

Contributions from the vector component to the dynamic dipole polarizabilities

facilitating in choosing circular polarization of lasers in the experiments.
Moreover, the actual clock transitions in these ions are carried out among the

transitions are estimated and found to be different from $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$
for the atomic transitions due to different contributions coming from the

$\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$ values that depend only on the scalar component of

hold in all imaging situations and it is not a necessary condition for solving
the inverse problem of light propagation. Here, we present a method to solve
the linear inverse problem of coherent light propagation without assuming shift

main tethers that extend radially outward from the spacecraft in the sail spin
plane. Furthermore, the tips of the main tethers host remote units that are
connected by auxiliary tethers at the sail rim. Here, we derive the equation of
main tether shape and present both a numerical solution and an analytical
approximation for the shape as parametrized both by the ratio of the electric
sail force to the centrifugal force and the sail orientation with respect to
the solar wind direction. The resulting shape is such that near the spacecraft,
the roots of the main tethers form a cone, whereas towards the rim, this coning
is flattened by the centrifugal force, and the sail is coplanar with the sail
spin plane. Our approximation for the sail shape is parametrized only by the
tether root coning angle and the main tether length. Using the approximate
shape, we obtain the torque and thrust of the electric sail force applied to
the sail. As a result, the amplitude of the tether voltage modulation required
for the maintenance of the sail attitude is given as a torque-free solution.
The amplitude is smaller than that previously obtained for a rigid single
tether resembling a spherical pendulum. This implies that less thrusting margin
is required for the maintenance of the sail attitude. For a given voltage
modulation, the thrust vectoring is then considered in terms of the radial and
transverse thrust components.

quantum-classical system is described by a combined quantum system consisting
of two quantum cavity subsystems. Quantum filtering theory and a quantum
extended Kalman filter method are employed to estimate the states of the
combined quantum system. An estimate of the classical stochastic process is
derived from the estimate of the combined quantum system. The effectiveness and
performance of the proposed methods are illustrated by numerical results.

this process by using a Generalized Feynman-Kac (GFK) method[5] in which the
new measure associated with the trial function is stationary, so that the

up the convergence rate. We calculate the path integrals using space averaging

  Systems","9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Although a data processing system often works as a batch processing system,
many enterprises deploy such a system as a service, which we call the
service-oriented data processing system. It has been shown that in-memory data
processing systems suffer from serious memory pressure. The situation becomes
even worse for the service-oriented data processing systems due to various
reasons. For example, in a service-oriented system, multiple submitted tasks
are launched at the same time and executed in the same context in the
resources, comparing with the batch processing mode where the tasks are
processed one by one. Therefore, the memory pressure will affect all submitted
tasks, including the tasks that only incur the light memory pressure when they
are run alone. In this paper, we find that the reason why memory pressure
arises is because the running tasks produce massive long-living data objects in
the limited memory space. Our studies further reveal that the long-living data
objects are generated by the API functions that are invoked by the in-memory
processing frameworks. Based on these findings, we propose a method to classify
the API functions based on the memory usage rate. Further, we design a
scheduler called MURS to mitigate the memory pressure. We implement MURS in
Spark and conduct the experiments to evaluate the performance of MURS. The
results show that when comparing to Spark, MURS can 1) decrease the execution
time of the submitted jobs by up to 65.8\%, 2) mitigate the memory pressure in
the server by decreasing the garbage collection time by up to 81\%, and 3)
reduce the data spilling, and hence disk I/O, by approximately 90\%.

for the simulation of entangled polymer melts has been developed. Polymeric
beads consist of several Kuhn segments, and their motion is dictated by the
Helmholtz energy of the sample, which is a sum of the entropic elasticity of
chain strands between beads, slip springs, and nonbonded interactions. The
entanglement effect is introduced by the slip springs, which are springs
connecting either nonsuccessive beads on the same chain or beads on different
polymer chains. The terminal positions of slip springs are altered during the
simulation through a kinetic Monte Carlo hopping scheme, with rate-controlled
creation/destruction processes for the slip springs at chain ends. The rate
constants are consistent with the free energy function employed and satisfy
microscopic reversibility at equilibrium. The free energy of nonbonded
interactions is derived from an appropriate equation of state, and it is
computed as a functional of the local density by passing an orthogonal grid
through the simulation box; accounting for it is necessary for reproducing the
correct compressibility of the polymeric material. Parameters invoked by the
mesoscopic model are derived from experimental volumetric and viscosity data or
from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, establishing a ""bottom-up""
predictive framework for conducting slip spring simulations of polymeric
systems of specific chemistry. The mesoscopic simulation methodology is

and find that (1) the MFR corresponds well to the high $\mathcal{T}_{w}$ region

interpreting the bright structure at the base of the jet. The twist number of

instability is regarded as the initiation mechanism of the blowout jet as
$\mathcal{T}_{w}$ reaching or even exceeding the threshold value of the kink
instability. Our results also indicate that the bright point at the decaying

Information (VoI) analysis, in which we estimate expected reductions in loss
from learning specific parameters or collecting data of a given design. We
describe the theory and practice of VoI for Bayesian evidence synthesis, using
and extending ideas from health economics, computer modelling and Bayesian
design. The methods are general to a range of decision problems including point
estimation and choices between discrete actions. We apply them to a model for
estimating prevalence of HIV infection, combining indirect information from
several surveys, registers and expert beliefs. This analysis shows which
parameters contribute most of the uncertainty about each prevalence estimate,
and provides the expected improvements in precision from collecting specific
amounts of additional data.

logistic regression. This new approach makes easier the use of exponential
priors and the computation of lasso regularization path. Precisely, we study a
limiting behavior for which class imbalance is artificially increased by
replication of the majority class observations. If some strong overlap
conditions are satisfied, the maximum likelihood estimate converges towards a
finite value close to the initial one (intercept excluded) as shown by
simulations with binary predictors. This solution corresponds to the extremum
of a concave function that we refer to as ""rescaled"" likelihood. In this
context, the use of exponential priors has a clear interpretation as a shift on
the predictor means for the minority class. Thanks to the simple binary
structure, some random designs give analytic path estimators for the lasso
regularization problem. An effective approximate path algorithm by piecewise
logarithmic functions based on matrix inversions is also presented. This work
was motivated by its potential application to spontaneous reports databases in
a pharmacovigilance context.

rotational braking of any magnetic, massive star, with a rotational period

HD 108's observed X-ray luminosity is also much higher than predicted by the
XADM model, a unique discrepancy amongst magnetic O-type stars. Previously
reported magnetic data cover only a small fraction ($\sim$3.5\%) of $P_{\rm
rot}$, and were furthermore acquired when the star was in a photometric and
spectroscopic `low state' at which the longitudinal magnetic field $\langle
B_z\rangle$~was likely at a minimum. We have obtained a new ESPaDOnS magnetic
measurement of HD 108, 6 years after the last reported measurement. The star is
returning to a spectroscopic high state, although its emission lines are still
below their maximum observed strength, consistent with the proposed 55-year
period. We measured $\langle B_z\rangle=-325 \pm 45$ G, twice the strength of
the 2007-2009 observations, raising the lower limit of the dipole surface
magnetic field strength to $B_{\rm d} \ge 1$ kG. The simultaneous increase in
$\langle B_z\rangle$~and emission strength is consistent with the oblique
rotator model. Extrapolation of the $\langle B_z\rangle$~maximum via comparison
of HD 108's spectroscopic and magnetic data with the similar Of?p star HD
191612 suggests that $B_{\rm d} > 2$~kG, yielding $t_{\rm S, max}<3$~Myr,
compatible with the stellar age. These results also yield a better agreement
between the observed X-ray luminosity and that predicted by the XADM model.

vehicle routing is presented. Given a setting with multiple fields, a path
network connecting these, multiple depots at which a number of harvesters are
initially located, the main question addressed is: Which crop out of a set of
different crops to assign to each field when accounting for the given setting?
It must be answered by every farm manager at the beginning of every work-cycle
starting with plant seeding and ending with harvesting. Rather than solving an
assignment problem only, it is here also accounted for the connectivity between
fields. In practice, fields are often located distant apart. Traveling costs of
machinery and limited harvesting windows demand optimised operation and route
planning. Therefore, the proposed method outputs crop assignments to fields and
simultaneously determines crop-tours, i.e., optimised sequences in which to
service fields of the same crop during harvest. It is of particular relevance
for larger farms and groups of farms that collaborate and share machinery.
Integer programming based exact algorithms are derived. For large numbers of
fields, where these algorithms may not be tractable due to computational
constraints, elements of clustering and the solution of local Traveling
Salesman Problems are added, thereby on the one hand rendering the method
heuristic and in general suboptimal, but on the other hand maintaining
large-scale applicability.

process can lead to different planetary architectures (i.e. location, size,
mass, and water content) when the star system is single or double. In the late
phase of planetary formation, when embryo-sized objects dominate the inner
region of the system, asteroids are also present and can provide additional
material for objects inside the habitable zone (HZ). In this study, we make a
comparison of several binary star systems and aim to show how efficient they
are at moving icy asteroids from beyond the snow line into orbits crossing the
HZ. We also analyze the influence of secular and mean motion resonances on the
water transport towards the HZ. Our study shows that small bodies also
participate in bearing a non-negligible amount of water to the HZ. The
proximity of a companion moving on an eccentric orbit increases the flux of
asteroids to the HZ, which could result in a more efficient water transport on
a short timescale, causing a heavy bombardment. In contrast to asteroids moving
under the gravitational perturbations of one G-type star and a gas giant, we
show that the presence of a companion star not only favors a faster depletion
of our disk of planetesimals, but can also bring 4-5 times more water into the
whole HZ. However, due to the secular resonance located either inside the HZ or
inside the asteroid belt, impacts between icy planetesimals from the disk and
big objects in the HZ can occur at high impact speed. Therefore, real collision
modeling using a GPU 3D-SPH code show that in reality, the water content of the
projectile is greatly reduced and therefore, also the water transported to
planets or embryos initially inside the HZ.

combination of high signal-to-noise ratio and short rise time, thin LGADs
provide good time resolutions.
  LGADs with an active thickness of about 45 $\mu$m were produced at CNM
Barcelona. Their gains and time resolutions were studied in beam tests for two
different multiplication layer implantation doses, as well as before and after
irradiation with neutrons up to $10^{15}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$.
  The gain showed the expected decrease at a fixed voltage for a lower initial
implantation dose, as well as for a higher fluence due to effective acceptor
removal in the multiplication layer. Time resolutions below 30 ps were obtained
at the highest applied voltages for both implantation doses before irradiation.
Also after an intermediate fluence of $3\times10^{14}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$, similar
values were measured since a higher applicable reverse bias voltage could
recover most of the pre-irradiation gain. At $10^{15}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$, the
time resolution at the maximum applicable voltage of 620 V during the beam test
was measured to be 57 ps since the voltage stability was not good enough to
compensate for the gain layer loss. The time resolutions were found to follow
approximately a universal function of gain for all implantation doses and
fluences.

with frequent anomalies exhibiting unusually high or low values. We use Markov
Random Fields (MRFs) to detect spatio-temporally coherent anomalies in gridded
annual rainfall data across India from 1901-2005. MRFs are undirected graphical
models where each node is associated with a \{location,year\} pair, with edges
connecting nodes representing adjacent locations or years. Some nodes represent
observations of precipitation, while the rest represent unobserved
(\emph{latent}) states that can take one of three values: high/low/normal. The
MRF represents a probability distribution over the variables, using \emph{node
potential} and \emph{edge potential} functions defined on nodes and edges of
the graph. Optimal values of latent state variables are estimated by maximizing
the posterior probability of the observations, using Gibbs sampling. Edge
potentials enforce spatial and temporal coherence, and node potentials
influence threshold for anomalies by affecting the prior probabilities of the
states. The model can be tuned to recover anomalies detected by threshold-based
methods. The competing influences of spatial and temporal coherence can be
adjusted through edge potentials.
  We study spatio-temporal properties of rainfall anomalies discovered by this
method, using suitable measures. We identify nonstationarities in occurrence of
positive and negative anomalies between the first and second halves of the 20th
century. We find that between these periods, there has been decrease in
rainfall during June-September (JJAS) and an increase during other months.
These effects are highlighted prominently in the statistics of anomalies.
Properties of anomalies learnt from this approach could present tests of
regional-scale rainfall simulations by climate models and statistical
simulators.

  Why are the terrestrial planets so different? Venus should be the most
Earth-like of all our planetary neighbours: its size, bulk composition and
distance from the Sun are very similar to those of Earth. Its original
atmosphere was probably similar to that of early Earth, with abundant water
that would have been liquid under the young sun's fainter output. Even today,
with its global cloud cover, the surface of Venus receives less solar energy
than does Earth, so why did a moderate climate ensue here but a catastrophic
runaway greenhouse on Venus? How and why did it all go wrong for Venus? What
lessons can be learned about the life story of terrestrial planets in general,
in this era of discovery of Earth-like exoplanets? Were the radically different
evolutionary paths of Earth and Venus driven solely by distance from the Sun,
or do internal dynamics, geological activity, volcanic outgassing and
weathering also play an important part?

Venus orbiter named EnVision, to focus on Venus' geology and geochemical
cycles, seeking evidence for present and past activity. The payload comprises a
state-of-the-art S-band radar which will be able to return imagery at spatial

spots --- and understanding structure-dynamics relations in these systems
remain major scientific challenges. Here we derive an exact expression for the
local thermal energy of interacting particles (the mean local potential energy
change due to thermal fluctuations) in glassy systems by a systematic
low-temperature expansion. We show that the local thermal energy can attain
anomalously large values, inversely related to the degree of softness of
localized structures in a glass, determined by a coupling between internal
stresses --- an intrinsic signature of glassy frustration ---, anharmonicity
and low-frequency vibrational modes. These anomalously large values follow a
fat-tailed distribution, with a universal exponent related to the recently
observed universal $\omega^4$ density of states of quasi-localized
low-frequency vibrational modes. When the spatial thermal energy field --- a
`softness field' --- is considered, this power-law tail manifests itself by
highly localized spots which are significantly softer than their surroundings.
These soft spots are shown to be susceptible to plastic rearrangements under
external driving forces, having predictive powers that surpass those of the
normal-modes-based approach. These results offer a general,
system/model-independent, physical-observable-based approach to identify
structural properties of quiescent glasses and to relate them to glassy
dynamics.

  * What is the smallest $n$ such that there is some element of the ternary

strongly dependent on wavelength (~1 day delay between B and I bands). The
second component, emerging simultaneously with the nova detection in
gamma-rays, evolves at a slower pace, its optical brightness being proportional
to the gamma-ray flux, and its passage through maximum not dependent on

by 4x from novae at the distance of the Bulge seems to suggest that gamma-ray
emission is not a widespread property of normal novae. We discuss the

one telescope (as opposed to data provided by a number of different

produced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time
reaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the
corona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the
formed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the
nuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum
and be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal
anisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC
energy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,
about 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with
p_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton
traversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift
of about 7 GeV (I would call it as a parton binding energy) from the original
power law p^{-6} production cross section in pp explains well all the observed
R_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at RHIC energy,
where the cross section follows a power law with about p^{-8} and this shift
explains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for neutral pions with p_t above 15
GeV/c. We also show that the observed at LHC dependence of v_2 at high p_t and
our previous predictions agree.

this paper, therefore, we make the first attempt to tackle a new challenging

formulate a new optimization, named Service Overlay Forest (SOF), to minimize
the total cost of all allocated VNFs and all multicast trees in the forest. We
design a new $3\rho_{ST}$-approximation algorithm to solve the problem, where
$\rho_{ST}$ denotes the best approximation ratio of the Steiner Tree problem,

enjoy superiority to previous ones in finding the correct mapping with the

group-theoretic methods, which allow us to identify and enumerate these inputs,
and argue about irreversible system behaviors with undesired effects on many
computational problems. The concept of so-called configuration shift-symmetry
is applied to two-dimensional cellular automata as an ideal model of
computation. Regardless of the transition function, the results show the
universal insolvability of crucial distributed tasks, such as leader election,
pattern recognition, hashing, and encryption. By using compact enumeration

shift-symmetric for a uniform or density-uniform distribution. Further, we
devise an algorithm detecting the presence of shift-symmetry in a
configuration.
  Given the resource constraints, the enumeration and probability formulas can
directly help to lower the minimal expected error and provide recommendations
for system's size and initialization. Besides cellular automata, the

a stable fixed point at which the scalar-quartic and the Yukawa coupling

the finite value of the Yukawa coupling constants in the standard model.

optimization is the large scale of the input information that is available for
the controlling agent, namely all the traffic data that is continually sampled
by the traffic detectors that cover the urban network. This issue has in the
past forced researchers to focus on agents that work on localized parts of the
traffic network, typically on individual intersections, and to coordinate every
individual agent in a multi-agent setup. In order to overcome the large scale
of the available state information, we propose to rely on the ability of deep
Learning approaches to handle large input spaces, in the form of Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. We performed several

provide an upper and two lower bounds on this probability for a very general

for a special case where the links have identical probabilities across the

between any two nodes. Finally, we discuss scenarios where the information
regarding the presence and absence of links is initially available in the form
of time duration (of presence or absence intervals) continuous probability

this paper, we study analytically the maximum matchings in two scale-free

during and potentially even before the era of reionization. Although the number
of GRBs identified at z>6 remains small, they provide a unique window on
typical star-forming galaxies at that time, and thus are complementary to deep
field observations. We report the identification of the optical drop-out
afterglow of Swift GRB 120923A in near-infrared Gemini-North imaging, and
derive a redshift of z=7.84_{-0.12}^{+0.06} from VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy. At
this redshift the peak 15-150 keV luminosity of the burst was 3.2x10^52 erg/s,
and in fact the burst was close to the Swift/BAT detection threshold. The X-ray
and near-infrared afterglow were also faint, and in this sense it was a rather
typical long-duration GRB in terms of rest-frame luminosity. We present ground-
and space-based follow-up observations spanning from X-ray to radio, and find
that a standard external shock model with a constant-density circumburst
environment with density, n~4x10^-2 cm^-3 gives a good fit to the data. The
near-infrared light curve exhibits a sharp break at t~3.4 days in the observer
frame, which if interpreted as being due to a jet corresponds to an opening
angle of ~5 degrees. The beaming corrected gamma-ray energy is then
E_gamma~2x10^50 erg, while the beaming-corrected kinetic energy is lower,
E_K~10^49 erg, suggesting that GRB 120923A was a comparatively low kinetic
energy event. We discuss the implications of this event for our understanding
of the high-redshift population of GRBs and their identification.

able to describe the results of radiation and matter era numerical simulations

show that the fact that the energy of global monopoles is not localized within
their cores affects their dynamics and, thus, the Hubble damping terms in the
VOS equations. We study the ultra-relativistic linear scaling regime predicted
by the VOS equations and demonstrate that it cannot be attained either on

homogeneous fields, a simultaneous measurement is needed, as the homogeneous

focused on developing architectures such as the Inception and residual
networks. The convolution layer is the core of the CNN, but few studies have
addressed the convolution unit itself. In this paper, we introduce a
convolution unit called the active convolution unit (ACU). A new convolution
has no fixed shape, because of which we can define any form of convolution. Its
shape can be learned through backpropagation during training. Our proposed unit
has a few advantages. First, the ACU is a generalization of convolution; it can
define not only all conventional convolutions, but also convolutions with
fractional pixel coordinates. We can freely change the shape of the
convolution, which provides greater freedom to form CNN structures. Second, the
shape of the convolution is learned while training and there is no need to tune
it by hand. Third, the ACU can learn better than a conventional unit, where we
obtained the improvement simply by changing the conventional convolution to an
ACU. We tested our proposed method on plain and residual networks, and the
results showed significant improvement using our method on various datasets and
architectures in comparison with the baseline.

inserted Li atoms resulting in a disintegration of the host matrix. We found
that higher concentration of oxygen atoms in the mixture reduces its relative
expansion upon lithiation, which is a desirable quality for anode materials. It
helps in preventing crack formation and pulverization due to large fluctuations
in volume. Our study also demonstrate that a higher oxygen content increases
the lithium storage capacity of the anode. However, it can also cause the
formation of stable complexes like lithium silicates that might result into
reversible capacity loss as indicated by the voltage-composition curves. The
study provides valuable insights into the role of oxygen in moderating the

compute a stable matching of minimum or maximum weight. This problem is known
to be NP-hard in general. Our contribution is two fold: a polyhedral
characterization and an approximation algorithm. Previously Chen et al. have
shown that the stable matching polytope is integral if and only if the subgraph
obtained after running phase one of Irving's algorithm is bipartite. We improve
upon this result by showing that there are instances where this subgraph might
not be bipartite but one can further eliminate some edges and arrive at a
bipartite subgraph. Our elimination procedure ensures that the set of stable
matchings remains the same, and thus the stable matching polytope of the final
subgraph contains the incidence vectors of all stable matchings of our original
graph. This allows us to characterize a larger class of instances for which the
weighted stable matching problem is polynomial-time solvable. We also show that
our edge elimination procedure is best possible, meaning that if the subgraph
we arrive at is not bipartite, then there is no bipartite subgraph that has the
same set of stable matchings as the original graph. We complement these results
with a $2$-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight stable matching
problem for instances where each agent has at most two possible partners in any
stable matching. This is the first approximation result for any class of
instances with general weights.

agent and human societies. Nevertheless, choosing the norms to regulate a
society is by no means straightforward. The reasons are twofold. First, the
norms to choose from may not be independent (i.e, they can be related to each
other). Second, different preference criteria may be applied when choosing the
norms to enact. This paper advances the state of the art by modeling a series
of decision-making problems that regulation authorities confront when choosing
the policies to establish. In order to do so, we first identify three different
norm relationships -namely, generalisation, exclusivity, and substitutability-
and we then consider norm representation power, cost, and associated moral
values as alternative preference criteria. Thereafter, we show that the
decision-making problems faced by policy makers can be encoded as linear
programs, and hence solved with the aid of state-of-the-art solvers.

user wearing a head-mounted display: as the user rotates his head,
correspondingly different fields-of-view (FoV) of the 360 video are rendered
for observation. Transmitting the entire 360 video in high quality over
bandwidth-constrained networks from server to client for real-time playback is
challenging. In this paper we propose a multi-stream switching framework for VR
video streaming: the server pre-encodes a set of VR video streams covering
different view ranges that account for server-client round trip time (RTT)
delay, and during streaming the server transmits and switches streams according
to a user's detected head rotation angle. For a given RTT, we formulate an
optimization to seek multiple VR streams of different view ranges and the
head-angle-to-stream mapping function simultaneously, in order to minimize the
expected distortion subject to bandwidth and storage constraints. We propose an
alternating algorithm that, at each iteration, computes the optimal streams
while keeping the mapping function fixed and vice versa. Experiments show that
for the same bandwidth, our multi-stream switching scheme outperforms a
non-switching single-stream approach by up to 2.9dB in PSNR.

in Josephson junctions using the semiclassical RCSJ model of junction dynamics.
The influence of a 4$\pi$-periodic supercurrent contribution can be detected
through its effect on the width of the Shapiro steps and the Fourier spectrum
of the voltage signal. We explain how the inclusion of a capacitance term
results in a strong quenching of the odd steps when the junction is
underdamped, and hence may be used to effectively detect Majorana bound states.
Furthermore, in presence of capacitance the first and third steps are quenched
to a different degree, as observed experimentally. We examine the emission
spectrum of phase-locked solutions, showing that the presence of
period-doubling may difficult the measurement of the 4$\pi$-periodic
contribution from the Fourier spectrum. Finally, we study the voltage response
in the quasiperiodic regime and indicate how the Fourier spectra and the
first-return maps in this regime reflect the change of periodicity in the
supercurrent.

emails, news, and movies, they widely neglect mind-maps as a source for user
modeling. We consider this a serious shortcoming since we assume user modeling
based on mind maps to be equally effective as user modeling based on other
items. Hence, millions of mind-mapping users could benefit from user-modeling
applications such as recommender systems. The objective of this doctoral thesis
is to develop an effective user-modeling approach based on mind maps. To
achieve this objective, we integrate a recommender system in our mind-mapping
and reference-management software Docear. The recommender system builds user
models based on the mind maps, and recommends research papers based on the user
models. As part of our research, we identify several variables relating to
mind-map-based user modeling, and evaluate the variables' impact on
user-modeling effectiveness with an offline evaluation, a user study, and an
online evaluation based on 430,893 recommendations displayed to 4,700 users. We
find, among others, that the number of analyzed nodes, modification time,
visibility of nodes, relations between nodes, and number of children and
siblings of a node affect the effectiveness of user modeling. When all
variables are combined in a favorable way, this novel approach achieves
click-through rates of 7.20%, which is nearly twice as effective as the best
baseline. In addition, we show that user modeling based on mind maps performs
about as well as user modeling based on other items, namely the research
articles users downloaded or cited. Our findings let us to conclude that user
modeling based on mind maps is a promising research field, and that developers
of mind-mapping applications should integrate recommender systems into their
applications. Such systems could create additional value for millions of
mind-mapping users.

the x rays excite inner-shell electrons leading to the ionization of the

plasma, i.e., warm or hot dense matter. The resulting system consists of atoms
in various electronic configurations, thermalizing on sub-picosecond to
picosecond timescales after photoexcitation. We present a simulation study of
x-ray-heated solid-density matter. For this we use XMDYN, a Monte-Carlo
molecular-dynamics-based code with periodic boundary conditions, which allows
one to investigate non-equilibrium dynamics. XMDYN is capable of treating
systems containing light and heavy atomic species with full electronic
configuration space and 3D spatial inhomogeneity. For the validation of our
approach we compare for a model system the electron temperatures and the ion
charge-state distribution from XMDYN to results for the thermalized system
based on the average-atom model implemented in XATOM, an ab-initio x-ray atomic
physics toolkit extended to include a plasma environment. Further, we also
compare the average charge evolution of diamond with the predictions of a
Boltzmann continuum approach. We demonstrate that XMDYN results are in good
quantitative agreement with the above mentioned approaches, suggesting that the
current implementation of XMDYN is a viable approach to simulate the dynamics
of x-ray-driven non-equilibrium dynamics in solids. In order to illustrate the

framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health

this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on

MedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical and lab covariates
and supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between
observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of
patient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP
kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points
while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and
periodicity in patient observations. MedGP has a number of benefits over
current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series
data, (ii) quantifying confidence regions in the predictions, (iii) exploiting
a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) inferring interpretable
relationships among clinical covariates. We evaluate and compare results from
MedGP on the task of online prediction for three patient subgroups from two
medical data sets across 8,043 patients. We found MedGP improves online
prediction over baseline methods for nearly all covariates across different

of each directed edge is dominated by a parameter controlling the extent of
network reciprocity. We derive two expressions for the mean first passage time

agree well with each other. We also analytically determine all the eigenvalues
as well as their multiplicities for the fundamental matrix of the dynamical
process, and show that the largest eigenvalue has an identical dominant scaling

on the MFPT, which behaves as a power-law function of the system size with the
power exponent dependent on the parameter, signaling the crucial role of
reciprocity in random walks occurring in weighted networks.

located at the center of the Milky Way is currently the very best candidate for
a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in our immediate vicinity. The strongest
evidence for this is provided by measurements of stellar orbits, variable X-ray
emission, and strongly variable polarized near-infrared emission from the
location of the radio source Sagittarius~A* (SgrA*) in the middle of the
central stellar cluster. If SgrA* is indeed a SMBH it will, in projection onto
the sky, have the largest event horizon and will certainly be the first and
most important target of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) observations currently being prepared. These observations
in combination with the infrared interferometry experiment GRAVITY at the Very
Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and other experiments across the
electromagnetic spectrum might yield proof for the presence of a black hole at
the center of the Milky Way. It is, however, unclear when the ever mounting
evidence for SgrA* being associated with a SMBH will suffice as a convincing
proof. Additional compelling evidence may come from future gravitational wave
observatories. This manuscript reviews the observational facts, theoretical
grounds and conceptual aspects for the case of SgrA* being a black hole. We
treat theory and observations in the framework of the philosophical discussions
about ""(Anti)Realism and Underdetermination"", as this line of arguments allows
us to describe the situation in observational astrophysics with respect to
supermassive black holes. Questions concerning the existence of supermassive
black holes and in particular SgrA* are discussed using causation as an
indispensable element. We show that the results of our investigation are
convincingly mapped out by this combination of concepts.

approach to witness the rapid oscillations of the condensates for a relatively
smaller value of SO coupling in a time independent harmonic trap compared to
their counterparts in a transient trap. Keeping track of the evolution of the
condensates in a transient trap during its transition from confining to
expulsive trap, we notice that they collapse in the expulsive trap. We further
show that one can manipulate the scattering length through Feshbach resonance
to stretch the lifetime of the confining trap and revive the condensate.
Considering a SO coupled state as the initial state, the numerical simulation
indicates that the reinforcement of Rabi coupling on SO coupled BECs generates

estimation is based on precise measurements of the magnetic field at two
different locations, performed with two independent groups of particles. This
approach, however, is sensitive to fluctuations of the off-set field
determining the level-splitting of the particles and results in collective
dephasing. In this work we use the framework of quantum metrology to assess the
maximal accuracy for gradient estimation. For arbitrary positioning of
particles, we identify optimal entangled and separable states allowing the
estimation of gradients with the maximal accuracy, quantified by the quantum
Fisher information. We also analyze the performance of states from the
decoherence-free subspace (DFS), which are insensitive to the fluctuations of
the magnetic offset field. We find that these states allow to measure a
gradient directly, without the necessity of estimating the magnetic offset
field. Moreover, we show that DFS states attain a precision for gradient
estimation comparable to the optimal entangled states. Finally, for the above
classes of states we find simple and feasible measurements saturating the

enough to impact the physics of large scale structure formation. In particular,
the associated cut-off in the linear matter power spectrum modifies the
structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the scales probed by the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of distant quasars. We study this effect by making use of
dedicated cosmological simulations which take into account the hydrodynamics of
the IGM. We explore heuristically the amplitude of quantum pressure for the FDM
masses considered here and conclude that quantum effects should not modify
significantly the non-linear evolution of matter density at the scales relevant
to the measured Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power, and for $m_a \geq 10^{-22}$ eV. We
derive a scaling law between $m_a$ and the mass of the well-studied thermal
warm dark matter (WDM) model that is best adapted to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest

extrapolation. By comparing FDM simulations with the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power
spectra determined from the BOSS survey, and marginalizing over relevant
nuisance parameters, we exclude FDM masses in the range $10^{-22} \leq m_a <

about equal to the radius of the giant star, and the more compact companion
accretes mass through an accretion disk. The accretion disk is assumed to
launch two opposite jets that efficiently remove gas from the envelope along
the orbit of the companion. The efficient envelope removal by jets prevents the
binary system from entering a common envelope evolution, at least for part of
the time. The GEE might be continuous or intermittent. I crudely estimate the
total GEE time period to be in the range of about hundreds of years, for a
continuous GEE, and up to few tens of thousands of years for intermittent GEE.
The key new point is that the removal of envelope gas by jets during the GEE
prevents the system from entering a common envelope evolution, and by that
substantially increases the volume of the stellar binary parameter space that
leads to SNe IIb, both to lower secondary masses and to closer orbital
separations.

(H-FMM) for 2-D Helmholtz equation in layered media. To illustrate the main
algorithm ideas, we focus on the case of two and three layers in this work. The
key compression step in the H-FMM is based on a fact that the multipole
expansion for the sources of the free-space Green's function can be used also
to compress the far field of the sources of the layered-media or domain Green's
function, and a similar result exists for the translation operators for the
multipole and local expansions. The mathematical error analysis is shown
rigorously by an image representation of the Sommerfeld spectral form of the
domain Green's function. As a result, in the H-FMM algorithm, both the
""multipole-to-multipole"" and ""local-to-local"" translation operators are the
same as those in the free-space case, allowing easy adaptation of existing
free-space FMM. All the spatially variant information of the domain Green's
function are collected into the ""multipole-to-local"" translations and therefore
the FMM becomes ""heterogeneous"". The compressed representation further reduces
the cost of evaluating the domain Green's function when computing the local
direct interactions. Preliminary numerical experiments are presented to
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm with much improved
performance over some existing methods for inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, we
also show that, due to the equivalence between the complex line image
representation and Sommerfeld integral representation of layered media Green's
function, the new algorithm can be generalized to multi-layered media with
minor modification where details for compression formulas, translation
operators, and bookkeeping strategies will be addressed in a subsequent paper.

the $10-100$~au scale; this produces a disk that is misaligned with the
outflow. The outflows are classified into two types: a magneto-centrifugal wind
and a spiral flow. In the latter, because of the geometry, the axis of rotation
is misaligned with the magnetic field. The magnetic field has an internal
structure in the cloud cores, which also causes misalignment between the
outflows and the magnetic field on the scale of the cloud core. The
distribution of the angular momentum vectors in a core also has a non-monotonic
internal structure. This should create a time-dependent accretion of angular
momenta onto the circumstellar disk. Therefore, the circumstellar disks are
expected to change their orientation as well as their sizes in the long-term
evolutions.

Dirichlet-Laplacian on bounded open sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}$ with fractal
boundaries. It is well-known from the results of Lapidus and Pomerance
\cite{LapPo1} that the asymptotic second term of the eigenvalue counting
function can be described in terms of the Minkowski content of the boundary of
$\Omega$ provided it exists. He and Lapidus \cite{HeLap2} discussed a
remarkable extension of this characterization to sets $\Omega$ with boundaries
that are not necessarily Minkowski measurable. They employed so-called
generalized Minkowski contents given in terms of gauge functions more general
than the usual power functions. The class of valid gauge functions in their
theory is characterized by some technical conditions, the geometric meaning and
necessity of which is not obvious. Therefore, it is not completely clear how
general the approach is and which sets $\Omega$ are covered. Here we revisit
these results and put them in the context of regularly varying functions. Using
Karamata theory, it is possible to get rid of most of the technical conditions
and simplify the proofs given by He and Lapidus, revealing thus even more of
the beauty of their results. Further simplifications arise from
characterization results for Minkowski contents obtained in \cite{RW13}. We
hope our new point of view on these spectral problems will initiate some
further investigations of this beautiful theory.

data-intensive systems that have given rise to applications targeting
transformation and cleaning of data. However, while schema design, data
cleaning, and data migration are now reasonably well understood in isolation,
not much attention has been given to the interplay between the tools addressing
issues in these areas. We focus on the problem of determining whether the
available data-processing procedures can be used together to bring about the
desired quality of the given data. For instance, consider an organization
introducing new data-analysis tasks. Depending on the tasks, it may be a
priority to determine whether the data can be processed and transformed using
the available data-processing tools to satisfy certain properties or quality
assurances needed for the success of the task. Here, while the organization may
control some of its tools, some other tools may be external or proprietary,
with only basic information available on how they process data. The problem is
then, how to decide which tools to apply, and in which order, to make the data
ready for the new tasks?
  Toward addressing this problem, we develop a new framework that abstracts
data-processing tools as black-box procedures with only some of the properties
exposed, such as the applicability requirements, the parts of the data that the
procedure modifies, and the conditions that the data satisfy once the procedure
has been applied. We show how common tasks such as data cleaning and data
migration are encapsulated into our framework and, as a proof of concept, we
study basic properties of the framework for the case of procedures described by
standard relational constraints. While reasoning in this framework may be
computationally infeasible in general, we show that there exist well-behaved
special cases with potential practical applications.

walls, it remains to be seen how dense such domain walls can be packed
together. Here we show that a universal short range repulsion that scales with
the strength of the DM interaction exists among chiral domain walls. The
distance between the two walls can be reduced with application of out of plane
field, allowing formation of coupled domain walls. Surprisingly, the current
driven velocity of such coupled walls is independent of the out of plane field,
enabling manipulation of significantly compressed coupled domain walls using
current pulses. Moreover, we find that a single current pulse with optimum

with X-ray sources (mostly from Swift-XRT), correlated with other radio, IR and
optical data in the field. We built a set of Spectral Energy Distributions
(SED) templates representative of the various blazar classes, and we
quantitatively compared them to the observed multi-wavelength flux density data
for all Swift-XRT sources found within the Fermi error-box, by taking advantage
of some well-recognised regularities in the broad-band spectral properties of
the objects. We tested the procedure by comparison with a few well-known
blazars, and tested the chance for false positive recognition of UGS sources
against known pulsars and other Galactic and extragalactic sources. Based on
our spectral recognition tool, we find the blazar candidate counterparts for 14
2FGL UGSs among 183 selected at high galactic latitudes. Further our tool also
allows us rough estimates of the redshift for the candidate blazar. In a few
cases in which this has been possible (i.e. when the counterpart was a SDSS
object), we verified that our estimate is consistent with the measured
redshift. The estimated redshifts of the proposed UGS counterparts are larger,
on average, than those of known Fermi blazars, a fact that might explain the
lack of previous association or identification in published catalogues.

The first stage is a Multi-Path Region Proposal Network (MP-RPN) that proposes

to further boost its performance. The second stage is a Boosted Forests
classifier, which utilizes deep facial features pooled from inside the
candidate face regions as well as deep contextual features pooled from a larger
region surrounding the candidate face regions. This step is included to further
remove hard negative samples. Experiments show that this approach achieves

stochastic processes for analysing longitudinal semicontinuous data. In theory,
such models can offer greater flexibility than the standard two-part model with
patient-specific random effects. However, in practice the high dimensional
integrations involved in the marginal likelihood (i.e. integrated over the
stochastic processes) significantly complicates model fitting. Thus
non-standard computationally intensive procedures based on simulating the
marginal likelihood have so far only been proposed. In this paper, we describe
an efficient method of implementation by demonstrating how the high dimensional
integrations involved in the marginal likelihood can be computed efficiently.
Specifically, by using a property of the multivariate normal distribution and
the standard marginal cumulative distribution function identity, we transform
the marginal likelihood so that the high dimensional integrations are contained
in the cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution,
which can then be efficiently evaluated. Hence maximum likelihood estimation
can be used to obtain parameter estimates and asymptotic standard errors (from
the observed information matrix) of model parameters. We describe our proposed
efficient implementation procedure for the standard two-part model
parameterisation and when it is of interest to directly model the overall
marginal mean. The methodology is applied on a psoriatic arthritis data set

original sample comprises 20,247 objects, making it the largest sample of white
dwarfs with measured three-dimensional velocities. Furthermore, the volume
probed by our sample is large, allowing us to obtain relevant kinematical
information. In particular, our sample extends from a Galactocentric radial
distance $R_{\rm G}=7.8$~kpc to 9.3~kpc, and vertical distances from the
Galactic plane ranging from $Z=-0.5$~kpc to 0.5~kpc. We examine the mean

  Observations and Remote Sensing, 16 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for infrared small target
detection. They work well on the images with homogeneous backgrounds and
high-contrast targets. However, when facing highly heterogeneous backgrounds,
they would not perform very well, mainly due to: 1) the existence of strong
edges and other interfering components, 2) not utilizing the priors fully.
Inspired by this, we propose a novel method to exploit both local and non-local
priors simultaneously. Firstly, we employ a new infrared patch-tensor (IPT)
model to represent the image and preserve its spatial correlations. Exploiting
the target sparse prior and background non-local self-correlation prior, the
target-background separation is modeled as a robust low-rank tensor recovery
problem. Moreover, with the help of the structure tensor and reweighted idea,
we design an entry-wise local-structure-adaptive and sparsity enhancing weight
to replace the globally constant weighting parameter. The decomposition could
be achieved via the element-wise reweighted higher-order robust principal
component analysis with an additional convergence condition according to the
practical situation of target detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms the other state-of-the-arts, in particular for the images
with very dim targets and heavy clutters.

should be carried out through full multidimensional integrations. This reduces
the efficiency of the higher order FEM solvers especially when the coupling

level. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to
select a video for annotation. The API then detects the video labels (objects

whether an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that the API
will return only the adversary-desired labels. For this, we select an image,
which is different from the video content, and insert it, periodically and at a
very low rate, into the video. We found that if we insert one image every two

the inserted image. Note that the modification to the video is hardly
noticeable as, for instance, for a typical frame rate of 25, we insert only one
image per 50 video frames. We also found that, by inserting one image per
second, all the shot labels returned by the API are related to the inserted
image. We perform the experiments on the sample videos provided by the API

porous media. We first present a numerical scheme for the analysis of entropy
production in dissolving porous media. Our scheme uses a greyscale digital
model of natural chalk obtained by X-ray nanotomography. Greyscale models
preserve structural heterogeneities with very high fidelity, which is essential
for simulating a system dominated by infiltration instability. We focus on the
coupling between two types of entropy production: the percolative entropy
generated by dissipating the kinetic energy of fluid flow and the reactive
entropy that originates from the consumption of chemical free energy. Their
temporal patterns pinpoint three stages of microstructural evolution. We then
show that the regional mixing deteriorates infiltration instability by reducing
local variations in reactant distribution. In addition, we show that the
microstructural evolution can be particularly sensitive to the initially
present transport heterogeneities when the global flowrate is small. This
dependence on flowrate indicates that the need to resolve the structural
features of a porous system is greater when the residence time of the fluid is
long.

We combined a reactor network model with grey scale tomography to seek the
morphological interpretation for differences among geometric, reactive and

allowed us to delineate the experimentally convoluted variables and study
independently the effects of initial geometry and macroscopic flowrate.
Simulations based on North Sea chalk microstructure showed that geometric
surface not only serves as the interface for water-rock interactions but also
represents the regional transport heterogeneities that can be amplified
indefinitely by dissolutive percolation. Hence, RII leads to channelization of
the solid matrix, which results in fluid focusing and an increase in geometric
surface area. Fluid focusing reduces the reactive surface area and the
residence time of reactants, both of which amplify the differences in question,

channels form, leading to fluid breakthrough. This phenomenon is important in
geologic carbon storage, where the dissolution of CO2 in water increases the

intact reservoir. We demonstrate the controlling mechanism for the dissolution
patterns in natural porous materials. This was done using numerical simulations
based on high resolution digital models of North Sea chalk. We tested three
model scenarios, and found that aqueous CO2 dissolve porous media
homogeneously, leading to large breakthrough porosity. In contrast, CO2-free
solution develops elongated convective channels in porous media, known as
wormholes, and resulting in small breakthrough porosity. We further show that a
homogeneous dissolution pattern appears because the sample size is smaller than
the theoretical size of a developing wormhole. The result indicates that the
presence of dissolved CO2 expands the reactive subvolume of a porous medium,
and thus enhances the geochemical alteration of reservoir structures and might
undermine the sealing integrity of caprocks when minerals dissolve.

networks with an overwhelming geometric complexity. Despite decades of study,
the mechanism by which a dominant wormhole develops its path during growth
remains elusive. Here we show that the trajectory of a growing wormhole can be
predicted by identifying the flowpath with a so-called minimum cumulative
surface. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the cumulative surface
determines the position of the dissolution front. We then show, using numerical
simulation based on greyscale nanotomography data, that the tip of an advancing
pore always follows the migration of the most far reaching dissolution front.
Finally, we show the good accord between theory and the observation with in

process rather than, as classical theories imply, a stochastic one that can
only be analysed statistically. Our results shed new light on engineering of
artificial flow systems by exploiting self-organization in natural porous
materials.

injection of massive amounts of CO2 can undermine the mechanical stability of
the formation structure before carbon mineralization takes place. The
geomechanical impact of geologic carbon storage is therefore closely related to
the structural sustainability of the chosen reservoir as well as the
probability of buoyancy driven CO2 leakage through caprocks. Here we show, with
a combination of ex situ nanotomography and in situ microtomography, that the
presence of dissolved CO2 in water produces a homogeneous dissolution pattern
in natural chalk microstructure. This pattern stems from a greater apparent
solubility of chalk and therefore a greater reactive subvolume in a sample.
When a porous medium dissolves homogeneously in an imposed flow field, three
geomechanical effects were observed: material compaction, fracturing and grain
relocation. These phenomena demonstrated distinct feedbacks to the migration of
the dissolution front and severely complicated the infiltration instability
problem. We conclude that the presence of dissolved CO2 makes the dissolution
front less susceptible to spatial and temporal perturbations in the strongly
coupled geochemical and geomechanical processes.

of many geologic landscapes. Identifying the dissolution front, the interface
between the reactive and the unreactive regions in a dissolving medium, is a
prerequisite for studying dissolution kinetics. Despite its fundamental
importance, the dynamics of a dissolution front in an evolving natural
microstructure has never been reported. Here we show an unexpected spontaneous
migration of the dissolution front against the pressure gradient of a flow
field. This retraction stems from the infiltration instability induced surface
generation, which can lead to a reactive surface dramatically greater than the
ex situ geometric surface. The results are supported by a very good agreement
between observations made with real time X-ray imaging and simulations based on
static images of a rock determined by nanoCT. They both show that the in situ
specific surface area of natural porous media is dependent on the flow field
and reflects a balancing between surface generation and destruction. The
reported dynamics challenge many long-held understanding of water-rock
interactions and shed light on reconciling the discrepancies between field and
laboratory measurements of reaction kinetics.

charged particle on the dynamics of the particle itself. Here we report
experimental radiation emission spectra from ultrarelativistic positrons in
silicon in a regime where both quantum and radiation-reaction effects dominate
the dynamics of the positrons. We found that each positron emits multiple
photons with energy comparable to its own energy, revealing the importance of
quantum photon recoil. Moreover, the shape of the emission spectra indicates
that photon emissions occur in a nonlinear regime where positrons absorb
several quanta from the crystal field. Our theoretical analysis shows that only
a full quantum theory of radiation reaction is capable of explaining the
experimental results, with radiation-reaction effects arising from the recoils
undergone by the positrons during multiple photon emissions. This experiment is
the first fundamental test of quantum electrodynamics in a new regime where the
dynamics of charged particles is determined not only by the external
electromagnetic fields but also by the radiation-field generated by the charges
themselves. Future experiments carried out in the same line will be able to, in
principle, also shed light on the fundamental question about the structure of
the electromagnetic field close to elementary charges.
