Tsallis, Shannon and Gaussian entropy have been used to study decoherence
separately; in this paper, we compared the results of the sus-mentioned
entropies in nanostructures. The linear combination operator and the unitary
transformation was used to derive the magnetopolaron spectrum that strongly
interact with the LO phonons in the presence of electric field in the pseudo
harmonic and delta quantum dot. Numerical results revealed for the quantum
pseudo dot that: (i) The amplitude of Gauss entropy is greater than the
amplitude of Tsallis entropy which inturn is greater than the amplitude of
Shannon entropy. The Tsallis entropy is not more significant in nanostructure
compared to Shannon and Gauss entropies, (ii) With an increase of the zero
point, the dominance of the Gauss entropy on the Shannon entropy was observed
on one hand and the dominance of the Shannon entropy on the Tsallis entropy on
the other hand ; this suggested that in nanostructures, Gauss entropy is more
suitable in the evaluation of the average of information in the system, for the
delta quantum dot it was observed that (iii) when the Gauss entropy is
considered, a lot of information about the system is missed. The collapse
revival phenomenon in Shannon entropy was observed in RbCl and GaAs delta
quantum dot with the enhancement of delta parameter; with an increase in this
parameter, the system in the case of CsI evolved coherently; with Shannon and
Tsallis entropies , information in the system is faster and coherently
exchanged; (iv) The Shannon entropy is more significant because its amplitude
outweighs on the others when the delta dimension length enhances. The Tsallis
entropy involves as wave bundle; which oscillate periodically with an increase
of the oscillation period when delta dimension length is improved.

in NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright FRED-type outburst
in 2013 can be understood in the framework of thermal emission from
unstationary accretion disc with temperature radial distribution transforming
from a single-temperature blackbody emitting ring into the multi-colour
irradiated accretion disc. SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state
transition looks curious, as it can not be repro- duced by the standard disc
irradiation model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR
spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux
changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our interpreta-
tion, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting parts of the
accretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination from the central
source and are heated primary by hard X-rays (E > 10 keV), scattered in the hot
corona or wind possibly formed above the optically-thick outer accretion flow;
the outer edge of multi-colour disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated
primary by direct X-ray illumination.
  We point out that future simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of X-ray
Nova systems during the fast X-ray state transition interval are of great
importance, as it can serve as 'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions
in outer regions of accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to
directly test the energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure
and accretion flow geometry in transient LMXBs.

  arXiv:1509.03697, and was submitted again due to some confusion",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian shrinkage methods have generated a lot of recent interest as tools
for high-dimensional regression and model selection. These methods naturally
facilitate tractable uncertainty quantification and incorporation of prior
information. A common feature of these models, including the Bayesian lasso,
global-local shrinkage priors, and spike-and-slab priors is that the
corresponding priors on the regression coefficients can be expressed as scale
mixture of normals. While the three-step Gibbs sampler used to sample from the
often intractable associated posterior density has been shown to be
geometrically ergodic for several of these models (Khare and Hobert, 2013; Pal
and Khare, 2014), it has been demonstrated recently that convergence of this
sampler can still be quite slow in modern high-dimensional settings despite
this apparent theoretical safeguard. We propose a new method to draw from the
same posterior via a tractable two-step blocked Gibbs sampler. We demonstrate
that our proposed two-step blocked sampler exhibits vastly superior convergence
behavior compared to the original three- step sampler in high-dimensional
regimes on both real and simulated data. We also provide a detailed theoretical
underpinning to the new method in the context of the Bayesian lasso. First, we
derive explicit upper bounds for the (geometric) rate of convergence.
Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that while the original Bayesian
lasso chain is not Hilbert-Schmidt, the proposed chain is trace class (and
hence Hilbert-Schmidt). The trace class property has useful theoretical and
practical implications. It implies that the corresponding Markov operator is
compact, and its eigenvalues are summable. It also facilitates a rigorous
comparison of the two-step blocked chain with ""sandwich"" algorithms which aim
to improve performance of the two-step chain by inserting an inexpensive extra
step.

significantly reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining high image
quality is an important area of research in low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. We
propose a new penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction method
that exploits regularization based on an efficient Union of Learned TRAnsforms
(PWLS-ULTRA). The union of square transforms is pre-learned from numerous image
patches extracted from a dataset of CT images or volumes. The proposed
PWLS-based cost function is optimized by alternating between a CT image
reconstruction step, and a sparse coding and clustering step. The CT image
reconstruction step is accelerated by a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian
method with ordered-subsets that reduces the number of forward and back
projections. Simulations with 2-D and 3-D axial CT scans of the extended
cardiac-torso phantom and 3D helical chest and abdomen scans show that for both
normal-dose and low-dose levels, the proposed method significantly improves the
quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS reconstruction with a
nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP). PWLS with regularization
based on a union of learned transforms leads to better image reconstructions
than using a single learned square transform. We also incorporate patch-based
weights in PWLS-ULTRA that enhance image quality and help improve image
resolution uniformity. The proposed approach achieves comparable or better
image quality compared to learned overcomplete synthesis dictionaries, but
importantly, is much faster (computationally more efficient).

is investigated by comparing a non-equilibrium transport approach, the
Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD), to a 2D+1 viscous hydrodynamical model,
which is based on the assumption of local equilibrium and conservation laws.
Starting the hydrodynamical model from the same non-equilibrium initial
condition as in the PHSD, using an equivalent lQCD Equation-of-State (EoS), the
same transport coefficients, i.e. shear viscosity $\eta$ and the bulk viscosity
$\zeta$ in the hydrodynamical model, we compare the time evolution of the
system in terms of energy density, Fourier transformed energy density, spatial
and momentum eccentricities and ellipticity in order to quantify the traces of
non-equilibrium phenomena. In addition, we also investigate the role of initial
pre-equilibrium flow on the hydrodynamical evolution and demonstrate its
importance for final state observables. We find that due to non-equilibrium
effects, the event-by-event transport calculations show large fluctuations in
the collective properties, while ensemble averaged observables are close to the
hydrodynamical results.

minimization problems with simple constraints and inexact oracle. The objective
function is given as a sum of ""`hard""', possibly non-convex part, and
""`simple""' convex part. Informally speaking, oracle inexactness means that, for
the ""`hard""' part, at any point we can approximately calculate the value of the
function and construct a quadratic function, which approximately bounds this
function from above. We give several examples of such inexactness: smooth
non-convex functions with inexact H\""older-continuous gradient, functions given
by auxiliary uniformly concave maximization problem, which can be solved only
approximately. For the introduced class of problems, we propose a gradient-type
method, which allows to use different proximal setup to adapt to geometry of
the feasible set, adaptively chooses controlled oracle error, allows for
inexact proximal mapping. We provide convergence rate for our method in terms
of the norm of generalized gradient mapping and show that, in the case of
inexact H\""older-continuous gradient, our method is universal with respect to
H\""older parameters of the problem. Finally, in a particular case, we show that
small value of the norm of generalized gradient mapping at a point means that a
necessary condition of local minimum approximately holds at that point.

remarkable physical link between the two populations. GMCs and YSCCs follow the
HI filaments, except in the outermost regions where the survey finds fewer GMCs
than YSCCs, likely due to undetected, low CO-luminosity clouds. The GMCs have
masses between 2$\times 10^4$ and 2$\times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ and are classified
according to different cloud evolutionary stages: inactive clouds are 32$\%$ of
the total, classified clouds with embedded and exposed star formation are
16$\%$ and 52$\%$ of the total respectively. Across the regular southern spiral
arm, inactive clouds are preferentially located in the inner part of the arm,
possibly suggesting a triggering of star formation as the cloud crosses the
arm. Some YSCCs are embedded star-forming sites while the majority have
GALEX-UV and H$\alpha$ counterparts with estimated cluster masses and ages. The
distribution of the non-embedded YSCC ages peaks around 5~Myrs with only a few
being as old as 8--10~Myrs. These age estimates together with the number of
GMCs in the various evolutionary stages lead us to conclude that 14~Myrs is a
typical lifetime of a GMC in M33, prior to cloud dispersal. The inactive and
embedded phases are short, lasting about 4 and 2~Myrs respectively. This
underlines that embedded YSCCs rapidly break out from the clouds and become
partially visible in H$\alpha$ or UV long before cloud dispersal.

particulate products depends on the production of particles with a desired size
and shape from a previous primary operation such as crystallisation. This is
because these properties of size and shape affect the behaviour of the
particles in the secondary processes. The size and the shape of the particles
are very sensitive to the conditions of the crystallisation processes, and so
control of these processes is essential. This control requires the development
of software tools that can effectively and efficiently process the sensor data
captured in situ. However, these tools have various strengths and limitations
depending on the process conditions and the nature of the particles.
  In this work, we employ wet milling of crystalline particles as a case study
of a process which produces effects typical to crystallisation processes. We
study some of the strengths and limitations of our previously introduced tools
for estimating the particle size distribution (PSD) and the aspect ratio from
chord length distribution (CLD) and imaging data. We find situations where the
CLD tool works better than the imaging tool and vice versa. However, in general
both tools complement each other, and can therefore be employed in a suitable
multi-objective optimisation approach to estimate PSD and aspect ratio.

problems, which take a specific form. Furthermore, these optimization problems

Felsberg and Sommer in 2001 and has been employed for a variety of purposes in
image processing and computer vision research. In particular, it has been found
to be useful in the analysis of ultrasound imagery in several research
scenarios mostly in work done within the BioMedIA lab at Oxford. However, the
literature on the monogenic signal can be difficult to penetrate due to the
lack of a single resource to explain the various principles from basics. The
purpose of this document is therefore to introduce the principles, purpose,
applications, and limitations of the methodology. It assumes some background
knowledge from the fields of image and signal processing, in particular a good
knowledge of Fourier transforms as applied to signals and images. We will not

out of the quantum vacuum by a strong and slowly varying electric field. This
effect can be dynamically assisted by an additional weaker time-dependent
field, which may drastically enhance the pair-creation probability. In previous
studies, it has been found that the enhancement may crucially depend on the
temporal shape of this weaker pulse, e.g., a Gaussian profile $\exp\{-(\omega
t)^2\}$ or a Sauter pulse $1/\cosh^2(\omega t)$ behave quite differently. In
order to understand this difference, we make a perturbative expansion in terms
of the weaker field while treating the strong electric field
non-perturbatively. For a large class of profiles including the Sauter pulse,
already the sum of the zeroth-order and the first-order amplitudes of this
perturbative expansion yields good agreement. For other cases, such as a
Gaussian or sinusoidal profile, this is not true in general and higher orders
can yield the dominant contribution - where the dominant order depends on the
chosen parameters. Our findings are confirmed by numerical simulations and help
us to sort previous results into a bigger picture.

  In previous works, J.Y. Chemin and Cl. David obtained new results for the

uses the fact that for this nonlinear equation, solutions of scales which are
different enough almost do not interact. The nonlinearity of the original
equation just required to determine a condition about the size of the scale
which depends continuously on the data.
  The idea is to apply the building technique of the map described above,
starting from the point that the Black-Scholes equation can be transformed into
a linear heat equation, which has a natural scaling invariance, and that the
linearity of the transformed equation enables one to obtain exact solutions,
and, thus, yield interesting results. The aim of this paper is to present a new
way to change either the Delta, or other greeks, by a given amount ; this
technique appears thus as a new way to control the equation, without resorting
to control functions. Indeed, one can change the greeks directly using the

resummed vertices with two hard and $n$ soft momenta in cosmological
perturbation theory. These responses measure the impact of long-wavelength

of the responses (i.e., their angular dependence) can be decomposed
unambiguously through a ""bias"" expansion of the local power spectrum, with a
fixed number of physical response coefficients, which are only a function of
the hard wavenumber $k$. Further, the responses up to $n$-th order completely
describe the $(n+2)$-point function in the squeezed limit, i.e. with two hard
and $n$ soft modes, which one can use to derive the response coefficients. This
generalizes previous results, which relate the angle-averaged squeezed limit to
isotropic response coefficients. We derive the complete expression of first-
and second-order responses at leading order in perturbation theory, and present
extrapolations to nonlinear scales based on simulation measurements of the
isotropic response coefficients. As an application, we use these results to
predict the non-Gaussian part of the angle-averaged matter power spectrum
covariance ${\rm Cov}^{\rm NG}_{\ell = 0}(k_1,k_2)$, in the limit where one of
the modes, say $k_2$, is much smaller than the other. Without any free
parameters, our model results are in very good agreement with simulations for
$k_2 \lesssim 0.06\ h/{\rm Mpc}$, and for any $k_1 \gtrsim 2 k_2$. The
well-defined kinematic structure of the power spectrum response also permits a
quick evaluation of the angular dependence of the covariance matrix. While we
focus on the matter density field, the formalism presented here can be

correlated over several mega-parsecs. The large-scale ""galactic conformity""
phenomenon around central galaxies has been regarded as a potential signature
of ""galaxy assembly bias"" or ""pre-heating"", both of which interpret conformity
as a result of direct environmental effects acting on galaxy formation.
Building on the iHOD halo quenching framework developed in Zu & Mandelbaum
(2015, 2016), we discover that our fiducial halo mass quenching model, without
any galaxy assembly bias, can successfully explain the overall environmental
dependence and the conformity of galaxy colours in SDSS, as measured by the
mark correlation functions of galaxy colours and the red galaxy fractions
around isolated primaries, respectively. Our fiducial iHOD halo quenching mock
also correctly predicts the differences in the spatial clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing signals between the more vs. less red galaxy subsamples,
split by the red-sequence ridge-line at fixed stellar mass. Meanwhile, models
that tie galaxy colours fully or partially to halo assembly bias have
difficulties in matching all these observables simultaneously. Therefore, we
demonstrate that the observed environmental dependence of galaxy colours can be
naturally explained by the combination of 1) halo quenching and 2) the
variation of halo mass function with environment --- an indirect environmental
effect mediated by two separate physical processes.

third UCDs known to host supermassive BHs. They both have a high fraction of
their total mass in their BH; $\sim$13% for VUCD3 and $\sim$18% for M59cO. They
also have low best-fit stellar $M/L$s, supporting the proposed scenario that
most massive UCDs host high mass fraction BHs. The properties of the BHs and
UCDs are consistent with both objects being the tidally stripped remnants of
$\sim$10$^9$ M$_\odot$ galaxies.

potential candidate for moderating gas cooling and subsequent star formation
through depositing energy in the intra-cluster gas. In this work, we simulate
the jet-intra-cluster medium interaction using the moving-mesh
magnetohydrodynamics code Arepo. Our model injects supersonic, low density,
collimated and magnetised outflows in cluster centres, which are then stopped
by the surrounding gas, thermalise and inflate low-density cavities filled with
cosmic-rays. We perform high-resolution, non-radiative simulations of the lobe
creation, expansion and disruption, and find that its dynamical evolution is in
qualitative agreement with simulations of idealised low-density cavities that
are dominated by a large-scale Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The buoyant rising
of the lobe does not create energetically significant small-scale chaotic
motion in a volume-filling fashion, but rather a systematic upward motion in
the wake of the lobe and a corresponding back-flow perpendicular to it. We find
that, overall, 50 per cent of the injected energy ends up in material which is
not part of the lobe, and about 25 per cent remains in the inner 100 kpc. We
conclude that jet-inflated, buoyantly rising cavities drive systematic gas
motions which play an important role in heating the central regions, while
mixing of lobe material is sub-dominant. Encouragingly, the main mechanisms
responsible for this energy deposition can be modelled already at resolutions
within reach in future, high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy
clusters.

observe because the most abundant molecule (H2) lacks a permanent dipole
moment. Rotational transitions of CO are often used as a tracer of H2, but CO
is much less abundant and the conversion from CO intensity to H2 mass is often
highly uncertain. Here we present a new method for estimating the column
density of cold molecular gas (Sigma_gas) using optical spectroscopy. We
utilise the spatially resolved H-alpha maps of flux and velocity dispersion
from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy
Survey. We derive maps of Sigma_gas by inverting the multi-freefall star
formation relation, which connects the star formation rate surface density
(Sigma_SFR) with Sigma_gas and the turbulent Mach number (Mach). Based on the
measured range of Sigma_SFR = 0.005-1.5 M_sol/yr/kpc^2 and Mach = 18-130, we
predict Sigma_gas = 7-200 M_sol/pc^2 in the star-forming regions of our sample
of 260 SAMI galaxies. These values are close to previously measured Sigma_gas
obtained directly with unresolved CO observations of similar galaxies at low
redshift. We classify each galaxy in our sample as 'Star-forming' (219) or
'Composite/AGN/Shock' (41), and find that in Composite/AGN/Shock galaxies the
average Sigma_SFR, Mach, and Sigma_gas are enhanced by factors of 2.0, 1.6, and
1.3, respectively, compared to Star-forming galaxies. We compare our
predictions of Sigma_gas with those obtained by inverting the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation and find that our new method is a factor of two more accurate in
predicting Sigma_gas, with an average deviation of 32% from the actual
Sigma_gas.

relevance of a statistical approach to planetary orbits. In such a statistical
description, the time-dependent position and velocity of the planets are
replaced by the probability density function (PDF) of their orbital elements.
It is quite natural to set up this kind of approach in the framework of
statistical mechanics. In the present paper I focus on the collisionless
excitation of eccentricities and inclinations by gravitational interactions in
a planetary system, the prototype of such a dynamics being the future planet
trajectories in the solar system. I thus address the statistical mechanics of
the planetary orbits in the solar system and try to reproduce the PDFs
numerically constructed by Laskar (2008). I show that the microcanonical
ensemble of the Laplace-Lagrange theory accurately reproduce the statistics of
the giant planet orbits. To model the inner planets I then investigate the
ansatz of equiprobability in the phase space constrained by the secular
integrals of motion. The eccentricity and inclination PDFs of Earth and Venus
are reproduced with no free parameters. Within the limitations of a stationary
model, the predictions also show a reasonable agreement with Mars PDFs and that
of Mercury inclination. The eccentricity of Mercury demands in contrast a
deeper analysis. I finally revisit Laskar's random walk approach to the time
dependence of the inner planet PDFs. Such a statistical theory could be
combined with direct numerical simulations of planet trajectories in the
context of planet formation, which is likely to be a chaotic process.

$R(D^{(*)})$ anomaly using two scalar leptoquarks (LQs) with the same mass and
coupling to fermions related via a discrete symmetry: an $SU(2)$ singlet and an
$SU(2)$ triplet, both with hypercharge $Y=-2/3$. In this way, potentially
dangerous contributions to $b\to s\nu\nu$ are avoided and non-CKM suppressed
effects in $R(D^{(*)})$ can be generated. This allows for smaller overall
couplings to fermions weakening the direct LHC bounds. In our model,
$R(D^{(*)})$ is directly correlated to $b\to s\tau^+\tau^-$ transitions where
an enhancement by orders of magnitude compared to the standard model (SM) is
predicted, such that these decay modes are in the reach of LHCb and BELLE II.
Furthermore, one can also naturally explain the $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ anomalies
(including $R(K)$) by a $C_9=-C_{10}$ like contribution without spoiling
$\mu-e$ universality in charged current decays. In this case sizable effects in
$b\to s\tau\mu$ transitions are predicted which are again well within the
experimental reach. One can even address the longstanding anomaly in $a_\mu$,
generating a sizable decay rate for $\tau\to\mu\gamma$. However, we find that
out of the three anomalies $R(D^{(*)})$, $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ and $a_{\mu}$ only
two (but any two) can be explained simultaneously.

model all planet transits and subtract out the transit signals for each star,
restoring the in-transit data points, and use the Kepler pipeline to search the

However, with the increasing area of sky covered by dark energy experiments,

recover convergence fields on the celestial sphere using an extension of the

recover convergence maps in the planar setting, considering a variety of
different projections and defining the local rotations that are required when
projecting spin fields such as cosmic shear. For the sky coverages typical of
future surveys, errors introduced by projection effects can be of order tens of
percent, exceeding 50% in some cases. The stereographic projection, which is
conformal and so preserves local angles, is the most effective planar
projection. In any case, these errors can be avoided entirely by recovering
convergence fields directly on the celestial sphere. We apply the spherical
Kaiser-Squires mass-mapping method presented to the public Dark Energy Survey

the size evolution of quiescent galaxies from the star-forming population by
assuming different simple models for the suppression of star-formation. These
models include an instantaneous and delayed quenching without altering the

that instantaneous quenching reproduces well the observed mass-size relation of

individual growth of the galaxies by minor mergers is preferred over other
models without structural change for $\log(m/M_{\odot})>11.0$ galaxies at

magnetic environment, and derive a set of sufficient conditions that allow one
to describe the dynamics in terms of the effective interaction with a classical
fluctuating field. We find that for short interaction times the dynamics of the
open system is described by a Gaussian noise map for several different
interaction models and independently on the temperature of the environment. In
order to go beyond a qualitative understanding of the origin and physical
meaning of the above short-time constraint, we take a general viewpoint and,
based on an algebraic approach, suggest that any quantum environment can be
described by classical fields whenever global symmetries lead to the definition
of environmental operators that remain well defined when increasing the size,
i.e. the number of dynamical variables, of the environment. In the case of the
bosonic environment this statement is exactly demonstrated via a constructive
procedure that explicitly shows why a large number of environmental dynamical
variables and, necessarily, global symmetries, entail the set of conditions
derived in the first part of the work.

the user can also define model-specific counter-terms. As an example we discuss
the renormalisation of the electric charge in the Thomson limit for top-quark
decays in the standard model. One-loop induced decays are also supported. The
framework additionally allows the addition of mass and mixing corrections
induced at higher orders for the involved external states. We explain our
procedure to cancel infra-red divergences for such cases, which is achieved
through an infra-red counter-term taking into account corrected Goldstone boson
vertices. We compare our results for sfermion, gluino and Higgs decays in the
minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) against the public codes SFOLD,
FVSFOLD and HFOLD and explain observed differences. Radiative induced gluino

cosmology. One problem that plagues the use of this tool in the era of

spectroscopic observation do not have properties that match those of (far more
numerous) dimmer galaxies; thus, ill-designed empirical methods that produce
accurate and precise redshift estimates for the former generally will not
produce good estimates for the latter. In this paper, we provide a principled
framework for generating conditional density estimates (i.e. photometric
redshift PDFs) that takes into account selection bias and the covariate shift
that this bias induces. We base our approach on the assumption that the
probability that astronomers label a galaxy (i.e. determine its spectroscopic
redshift) depends only on its measured (photometric and perhaps other)
properties x and not on its true redshift. With this assumption, we can
explicitly write down risk functions that allow us to both tune and compare
methods for estimating importance weights (i.e. the ratio of densities of
unlabeled and labeled galaxies for different values of x) and conditional
densities. We also provide a method for combining multiple conditional density
estimates for the same galaxy into a single estimate with better properties. We
apply our risk functions to an analysis of approximately one million galaxies,
mostly observed by SDSS, and demonstrate through multiple diagnostic tests that
our method achieves good conditional density estimates for the unlabeled

fields in order to improve liquid, gas or nanoparticle tracer for Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) in medical applications. In this paper we utilize
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the hyperpolarisation effect of
negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres on carbon-13 nuclei and their
spin diffusion in a diamond single crystal close to the excited state level
anti crossing (ESLAC) around 50 mT. Whereas the electron spins of the NV centre
can be easily polarized in its m = 0 ground state at room temperature just by
irradiation with green light , the swop of the NV electron spin polarization to
a carbon-13 nuclei is a complex task. We found that the coupling between the
polarized NV electron spin, the electron spin of a substitutional nitrogen
impurity (P1) as well as its nitrogen-14 nuclei and the carbon-13 nuclear spin
has to be considered. Here we show that through an optimization of this
procedure, in about two minutes a signal to noise ratio which corresponds to a
23 hour standard measurement without hyperpolarisation and an accumulation of
460 single scans can be obtained. Furthermore we were able to identify several
polarisation peaks of different sign at different magnetic fields in a region
of some tens of gauss. Most of the peaks can be attributed to a coupling of the
NV centres to nearby P1 centres. We present a new theoretical model in a
framework of cross polarisation of a four spin dynamic model in good agreement
with our experimental data. The results demonstrate the opportunities and power
as well as limitations of hyperpolarisation in diamond via NV centres. We

In order to undermine the correct decision under the alternative hypothesis
that the test sequence has not been drawn from $X$, the attacker can modify a

corrupt the training sequence either by adding some fake samples or by
replacing some samples with fake ones. We derive the unique rationalizable

assuming that the defender bases its decision by relying only on the first

possible to distinguish the various models via CP-violating effects in $B \to

all possible LQ models, only three can explain the data, and these are all
equivalent as far as $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ processes are concerned. In this
single LQ model, the weak phase of the coupling can be large, leading to some
sizeable CP asymmetries in $B \to K^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-$. There is a spectrum of
$Z'$ models; the key parameter is $g_L^{\mu\mu}$, which describes the strength
of the $Z'$ coupling to $\mu^+\mu^-$. If $g_L^{\mu\mu}$ is small (large), the
constraints from $B^0_s$-${\bar B}^0_s$ mixing are stringent (weak), leading to
a small (large) value of the NP weak phase, and corresponding small (large) CP
asymmetries. We therefore find that the measurement of CP-violating asymmetries

we consider a generic model of two weakly coupled dynamical systems, and show
how noise in one part of the system is transmitted through the coupling
interface. Working synergistically with the coupling, the noise on one system
drives a large fluctuation in the other, even when there is no noise in the
second system. Moreover, the large fluctuation happens while the first system
exhibits only small random oscillations. Uncertainty effects are quantified by
showing how characteristic time scales of noise induced switching scale as a
function of the coupling between the two coupled parts of the experiment. In
addition, our results show that the probability of switching in the noise-free
system scales inversely as the square of reduced noise intensity amplitude,
rendering the virtual probability of switching to be an extremely rare event.
Our results showing the interplay between transmitted noise and coupling are
also confirmed through simulations, which agree quite well with analytic

observed. Here we show that these misalignments can be generated through a
""secular precession resonance"" between the nodal precession of the inner disc
and the precession of the gap-opening (stellar or massive planetary) companion.
An evolving protostellar system may naturally cross this resonance during its
lifetime due to disc dissipation and/or companion migration. If resonance
crossing occurs on the right timescale, of order a few Myrs, characteristic for
young protostellar systems, the inner and outer discs can become highly
misaligned ($\gtrsim 60$ degrees). When the primary star has a mass of order a
solar mass, generating a significant misalignment typically requires the
companion to have a mass of $\sim 0.01-0.1$ M$_\odot$ and an orbital separation
of tens of AU. The recently observed companion in the cavity of the gapped,
highly misaligned system HD 142527 satisfies these requirements, indicating
that a previous resonance crossing event misaligned the inner and outer discs.
Our scenario for HD 142527's misaligned discs predicts that the companion's
orbital plane is aligned with the outer disc's; this prediction should be
testable with future observations as the companion's orbit is mapped out.
Misalignments observed in several other gapped disc systems could be generated
by the same secular resonance mechanism.

functions based upon the Chebyshev and Gegenbauer polynomials, have polynomial
factors $p_n(s)$, whose zeros lie all on the `critical line' $\Re\,s=1/2$ or on

terms of combinatorial sums related to H. W. Gould's S:4/3, S:4/2 and S:3/1
binomial coefficient forms. Their `critical polynomial' factors are then
identified as variants of the S:4/1 form, and more compactly in terms of
certain $_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we extend these
results to a $1$-parameter family of polynomials with zeros only on the
critical line. These polynomials possess the functional equation
$p_n(s;\beta)=\pm p_n(1-s;\beta)$, similar to that for the Riemann xi function.
  It is shown that via manipulation of the binomial factors, these `critical

yields the rational function $q_n(s).$ The denominator of the rational form has
singularities on the negative real axis, and so $q_n(s)$ has the same `critical

along the positive real axis, $q_n(s)\rightarrow 1$ from below, mimicking
$1/\zeta(s)$ on the positive real line.

form, and with $\mathcal{C}_n$ the $n$th Catalan number, $s$ an integer, we
show that polynomials $4\mathcal{C}_{n-1}p_{2n}(s)$ and

of different CoMP schemes, we identify their applicability and necessary
conditions for their use in downlink multi-cell NOMA system. After that, we
discuss different network scenarios with different spatial distributions of
users and study the applicability of CoMP schemes in these network scenarios.
To the end, a numerical performance evaluation is carried out for the proposed
CoMP-NOMA systems and the results are compared with those for conventional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based CoMP systems. The numerical results
quantify the spectral efficiency gain of the proposed CoMP-NOMA models over

Compiler optimization is one of the most effective solutions to tackle this

potential. However, all of these techniques provided with a compiler are
usually applied at compile time, so they rely on static analysis, which is
insufficient for achieving maximum parallelism and producing desired

runtime methods. This strategy can be implemented by delaying certain amount of
code analysis to be done at runtime. In this research, we improve the parallel

for problems of fluid-structure interaction, treating the particular case in
which an elastic structure is immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid. The
IB approach to such problems is to describe the elasticity of the immersed
structure in Lagrangian form, and to describe the momentum, viscosity, and
incompressibility of the coupled fluid-structure system in Eulerian form.
Interaction between Lagrangian and Eulerian variables is mediated by integral
equations with Dirac delta function kernels. The IB method provides a unified
formulation for fluid-structure interaction models involving both thin elastic
boundaries and also thick viscoelastic bodies. In this work, we describe the
application of an adaptive, staggered-grid version of the IB method to the
three-dimensional simulation of the fluid dynamics of the aortic heart valve.
Our model describes the thin leaflets of the aortic valve as immersed elastic
boundaries, and describes the wall of the aortic root as a thick, semi-rigid
elastic structure. A physiological left-ventricular pressure waveform is used
to drive flow through the model valve, and dynamic pressure loading conditions
are provided by a reduced (zero-dimensional) circulation model that has been
fit to clinical data. We use this model and method to simulate aortic valve
dynamics over multiple cardiac cycles. The model is shown to approach rapidly a
periodic steady state in which physiological cardiac output is obtained at
physiological pressures. These realistic flow rates are not specified in the
model, however. Instead, they emerge from the fluid-structure interaction
simulation.

produce the radioactive species that power radiation and give rise to the
formation of the observables. Therefore, the physical mechanism of the
combustion processes, as reviewed here, is the key to understand these
astrophysical events. Theory establishes two distinct modes of propagation for
combustion fronts: subsonic deflagrations and supersonic detonations. Both are
assumed to play an important role in thermonuclear supernovae. The physical

Carlo (QMC) simulation can behave similarly to quantum annealing (QA). The
theoretical analysis was based on calculating transition rates between local
minima, in the large spin limit using WentzelKramers-Brillouin (WKB)
approximation, for highly symmetric systems of ferromagnetically coupled
qubits. The rate of transition was observed to scale the same in QMC and
incoherent quantum tunneling, implying that there might be no quantum advantage
of QA compared to QMC other than a prefactor. Quantum annealing is believed to
provide quantum advantage through large scale superposition and entanglement
and not just incoherent tunneling. Even for incoherent tunneling, the scaling
similarity with QMC observed above does not hold in general. Here, we compare
incoherent tunneling and QMC escape using perturbation theory, which has much
wider validity than WKB approximation. We show that the two do not scale the
same way when there are multiple homotopy-inequivalent paths for tunneling. We
demonstrate through examples that frustration can generate an exponential
number of tunneling paths, which under certain conditions can lead to an
exponential advantage for incoherent tunneling over classical QMC escape. We
provide analytical and numerical evidence for such an advantage and show that
it holds beyond perturbation theory.

the strength of printed parts often does not rival that of
traditionally-manufactured parts. The fused-filament fabrication method
involves melting a thermoplastic, followed by layer-by-layer extrusion of the
molten viscoelastic material to fabricate a three-dimensional object. The
strength of the welds between layers is controlled by interdiffusion and
entanglement of the melt across the interface. However, diffusion slows down as
the printed layer cools towards the glass transition temperature. Diffusion is
also affected by high shear rates in the nozzle, which significantly deform and
disentangle the polymer microstructure prior to welding. In this paper, we
model non-isothermal polymer relaxation, entanglement recovery, and diffusion
processes that occur post-extrusion to investigate the effects that typical
printing conditions and amorphous (non-crystalline) polymer rheology have on
the ultimate weld structure. Although we find the weld thickness to be of the
order of the polymer size, the structure of the weld is anisotropic and
relatively disentangled; reduced mechanical strength at the weld is attributed
to this lower degree of entanglement.

millimeter wave (MMW)-based radio frequency (RF) and free-space optical (FSO)
links. The results are obtained in cases with and without hybrid automatic
repeat request (HARQ). Taking the MMW characteristics of the RF links into
account, we derive closed-form expressions for the networks' outage probability
and ergodic achievable rates. We also evaluate the effect of various parameters
such as power amplifiers efficiency, number of antennas as well as different
coherence times of the RF and the FSO links on the system performance. Finally,
we determine the minimum number of the transmit antennas in the RF link such
that the same rate is supported in the RF- and the FSO-based hops. The results
show the efficiency of the RF-FSO setups in different conditions. Moreover,
HARQ can effectively improve the outage probability/energy efficiency, and
compensate for the effect of hardware impairments in RF-FSO networks. For
common parameter settings of the RF-FSO dual-hop networks, outage probability
of 10^{-4} and code rate of 3 nats-per-channel-use, the implementation of HARQ
with a maximum of 2 and 3 retransmissions reduces the required power, compared
to cases with open-loop communication, by 13 and 17 dB, respectively.

underlying random graphs. The second step estimates parameters given the
estimated local structure of random graphs. Both steps can be implemented in

architecture for single microphone speech enhancement. By contrast to most
speech enhancement algorithms that overlook the speech variability mainly
caused by phoneme structure, our framework comprises a set of deep neural
networks (DNNs), each one of which is an 'expert' in enhancing a given speech
type corresponding to a phoneme. A gating DNN determines which expert is
assigned to a given speech segment. A speech presence probability (SPP) is then
obtained as a weighted average of the expert SPP decisions, with the weights
determined by the gating DNN. A soft spectral attenuation, based on the SPP, is
then applied to enhance the noisy speech signal. The experts and the gating
components of the DMoE network are trained jointly. As part of the training,
speech clustering into different subsets is performed in an unsupervised
manner. Therefore, unlike previous methods, a phoneme-labeled database is not
required for the training procedure. A series of experiments with different
noise types verified the applicability of the new algorithm to the task of
speech enhancement. The proposed scheme outperforms other schemes that either
do not consider phoneme structure or use a simpler training methodology.

call these p-value buckets. We present algorithms that, with arbitrarily high

great especially for $\sin2\beta$, and up and down quark masses. In this paper,
we show that by choosing PS as the gauge group and modifying the Yukawa sector,
the low energy fit improves significantly while other qualities of the model
are maintained. In particular, the lightest SUSY particle is the neutralino
with mass of order 300 - 500 GeV, the lightest stop and sbottom have mass of
order 3 - 5 TeV and the CP odd Higgs mass is of order 5 - 6 TeV, so we are in
the decoupling limit for the light Higgs. In addition, we reinterpret gluino
simplified model analyses by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations and find that the
most stringent gluino mass bound for our model is
$M_{\tilde{g}}\sim1.9\,\text{TeV}$. The current best fit point, consistent with
this bound, with gluino mass $M_{\tilde{g}}=1.9\,\text{TeV}$ has
$\chi^2/\text{dof}\approx1.12$, compared to the best fit point of the previous
model with $\chi^2/\text{dof}=1.90$. We find that predictions for the electric
dipole moment of the electron, the branching ratio $BR(\mu \rightarrow e
\gamma)$ and the CP violating angle in the lepton sector, $\sin\delta$, are
affected significantly as compared to previous results. In summary, we are
unable to rule out this model or place an upper bound on gluino mass accessible
by this run of the LHC because the $\chi^2/\text{dof}$ of this model is well
below $2\sigma$ even for a gluino mass as high as 2.7 TeV. On the bright side,
this means that this model is still viable and we might find low energy SUSY

high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Previous work has concentrated on
sensing of a constant magnetic field or a periodic signal. Here, we instead
investigate the problem of estimating a field with non-periodic variation
described by a Wiener process. We propose and study, by numerical simulations,
an adaptive tracking protocol based on Bayesian estimation. The tracking
protocol updates the probability distribution for the magnetic field, based on
measurement outcomes, and adapts the choice of sensing time and phase in real
time. By taking the statistical properties of the signal into account, our
protocol strongly reduces the required measurement time. This leads to a
reduction of the error in the estimation of a time-varying signal by up to a
factor 4 compared to protocols that do not take this information into account.

reached a point of having too many divergent data, making it difficult to be

different physical and dynamical objects.
  Radial velocity data on the so-called 3-kpc arms do not coincide with radial
velocities of major spiral arms near 3kpc, nor near 2 kpc, nor near 4 kpc from
the Galactic Center (Fig. 1 and 2).
  Different 3-kpc arm features may require different models: turbulence around
a shock in a Galactic density wave between 2 and 4 kpc from the Galactic Center
(Table 1), or nuclear rotation between 0 and 2 kpc from the Galactic Center
region (Table 2), or a putative radial expansion between 0 and 4 kpc from the
Galactic Center.
  Despite their naming as Near 3-kiloparsec arms or Far 3-kiloparsec arms,
these features are not major arms. Those 3-kpc arm features nearer the Galactic
Center (within 13o of Galactic longitude) may be different than those farther
out (Table 2).
  Here we show that the plethora of observed '3-kpc arm' features can be

the Galactic Center (Table 1 - some of which are possibly associated with the
observed major spiral arms), and those within 13 degrees from the Galactic

has been made spatially inhomogeneous is examined via numerical simulation. The
inhomogeneity is introduced via step functions in the reaction progress
variable, with the local value of energy release correspondingly increased so
as to maintain the same average energy density in the medium, and thus a
constant Chapman Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity. A one-step Arrhenius rate
governs the rate of energy release in the reactive zones. The resulting
dynamics of a detonation propagating in such systems with one-dimensional
layers and two-dimensional squares are simulated using a Godunov-type
finite-volume scheme. The resulting wave dynamics are analyzed by computing the
average wave velocity and one-dimensional averaged wave structure. In the case
of sufficiently inhomogeneous media wherein the spacing between reactive zones
is greater than the inherent reaction zone length, average wave speeds
significantly greater than the corresponding CJ speed of the homogenized medium
are obtained. If the shock transit time between reactive zones is less than the
reaction time scale, then the classical CJ detonation velocity is recovered.
The spatio-temporal averaged structure of the waves in these systems is
analyzed via a Favre averaging technique, with terms associated with the
thermal and mechanical fluctuations being explicitly computed. The analysis of
the averaged wave structure identifies the super-CJ detonations as weak
detonations owing to the existence of mechanical non-equilibrium at the
effective sonic point embedded within the wave structure. The correspondence of
the super-CJ behavior identified in this study with real detonation phenomena
that may be observed in experiments is discussed.

dimension. These spaces are the subject of intensive study in various branches
of mathematics, including geometry, topology, and measure theory. There are
several well-studied notions of fractal dimension for sets and measures in
Euclidean space. We consider a definition of fractal dimension for finite
metric spaces which agrees with standard notions used to empirically estimate
the fractal dimension of various sets. We define the fractal dimension of some
metric space to be the infimum $\delta>0$, such that for any $\epsilon > 0$,
for any ball $B$ of radius $r\geq 2\epsilon$, and for any $\epsilon $-net $N$
(that is, for any maximal $\epsilon $-packing), we have $|B\cap
N|=O((r/\epsilon)^\delta)$.
  Using this definition we obtain faster algorithms for a plethora of classical
problems on sets of low fractal dimension in Euclidean space. Our results apply
to exact and fixed-parameter algorithms, approximation schemes, and spanner
constructions. Interestingly, the dependence of the performance of these
algorithms on the fractal dimension nearly matches the currently best-known
dependence on the standard Euclidean dimension. Thus, when the fractal
dimension is strictly smaller than the ambient dimension, our results yield
improved solutions in all of these settings.

transient faults, as it guarantees that even in the presence of such faults,
the system will recover to states where it satisfies its specification. One of
the desirable attributes of stabilization is the use of bounded space for each
variable. In this paper, we present an algorithm that transforms a stabilizing
program that uses variables with unbounded domain into a stabilizing program
that uses bounded variables and (practically bounded) physical time. While
non-stabilizing programs (that do not handle transient faults) can deal with
unbounded variables by assigning large enough but bounded space, stabilizing
programs that need to deal with arbitrary transient faults cannot do the same
since a transient fault may corrupt the variable to its maximum value. We show
that our transformation algorithm is applicable to several problems including
logical clocks, vector clocks, mutual exclusion, leader election, diffusing
computations, Paxos based consensus, and so on. Moreover, our approach can also
be used to bound counters used in an earlier work by Katz and Perry for adding
stabilization to a non-stabilizing program. By combining our algorithm with
that earlier work by Katz and Perry, it would be possible to provide
stabilization for a rich class of problems, by assigning large enough but
bounded space for variables.

observes a supervisor and infers a control policy. A known problem with this
""off-policy"" approach is that the robot's errors compound when drifting away
from the supervisor's demonstrations. On-policy, techniques alleviate this by
iteratively collecting corrective actions for the current robot policy.
However, these techniques can be tedious for human supervisors, add significant
computation burden, and may visit dangerous states during training. We propose
an off-policy approach that injects noise into the supervisor's policy while
demonstrating. This forces the supervisor to demonstrate how to recover from
errors. We propose a new algorithm, DART (Disturbances for Augmenting Robot
Trajectories), that collects demonstrations with injected noise, and optimizes
the noise level to approximate the error of the robot's trained policy during
data collection. We compare DART with DAgger and Behavior Cloning in two
domains: in simulation with an algorithmic supervisor on the MuJoCo tasks
(Walker, Humanoid, Hopper, Half-Cheetah) and in physical experiments with human
supervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform grasping in clutter. For
high dimensional tasks like Humanoid, DART can be up to $3x$ faster in
computation time and only decreases the supervisor's cumulative reward by $5\%$
during training, whereas DAgger executes policies that have $80\%$ less
cumulative reward than the supervisor. On the grasping in clutter task, DART
obtains on average a $62\%$ performance increase over Behavior Cloning.

an efficient mechanism for the electronic manipulation of the static and

nanomagnetism and electronic transport, and enabling the development of
energy-efficient magnetic nanodevices. Our present understanding of spin
transfer is based on the classical approximation for the magnetization, even
though the spin-polarized electrons mediating spin transfer are treated
quantum-mechanically. Here, we utilize a nanoscale magnetic spin-valve
structure to demonstrate that quantum zero-point fluctuations of magnetization,
neglected in the existing theories of spin transfer, provide the dominant
contribution to this effect at cryogenic temperatures, and remain
non-negligible even at room temperature. The demonstrated quantum spin transfer
(QST) is distinguished by a non-smooth piecewise-linear dependence of the
fluctuation intensity on current, and can be driven not only by the directional
flows of electrons, but also by their thermal motion. This effect can enhance
current-induced phenomena, overcoming the efficiency limitations that are
presently perceived as fundamental to the spin transfer mechanism.

significantly adding to the similar effect by X-rays or dark matter

NP-hard quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Previous work on semidefinite

tight in practice, but such SDPs typically scale badly, involving matrix
variables of dimension $n^2$ where n is the number of nodes. To achieve a speed
up, we propose a further relaxation of the SDP involving a number of positive
semidefinite matrices of dimension $\mathcal{O}(n)$ no greater than the number
of edges in one of the graphs. The relaxation can be further strengthened by
considering cliques in the graph, instead of edges. The dual problem of this
novel relaxation has a natural three-block structure that can be solved via a
convergent Augmented Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in a distributed
manner, where the most expensive step per iteration is computing the
eigendecomposition of matrices of dimension $\mathcal{O}(n)$. The new SDP
relaxation produces strong bounds on quadratic assignment problems where one of
the graphs is sparse with reduced computational complexity and running times,
and can be used in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)

examined in the entanglement sudden death (ESD) and revival of entanglement
(ROE) phenomena. Even though particles move fast, the ESD phenomenon does not
disappear if it occurs at zero velocity. However the time domain $0 \leq t \leq
t_*$ for nonvanishing entanglement becomes larger and larger with increasing
velocity. When ROE phenomenon occurs at zero velocity, even small velocity can
make this phenomenon not to occur although the oscillatory behavior of
entanglement in time is maintained. For comparatively large velocity the
amplitude of the oscillatory behavior becomes extremely small. In this way the
entanglement can be protected by particle velocity. The protection of

realization of novel materials that have topological properties arising from
band inversion. Such topological insulators are insulating in the bulk but have
conductive surface or edge states. Topological materials show various unusual
physical properties and are surmised to enable the creation of exotic
Majorana-fermion quasiparticles. How the signatures of topological behavior
evolve when the system size is reduced is interesting from both a fundamental
and an application-oriented point of view, as such understanding may form the
basis for tailoring systems to be in specific topological phases. This work
considers the specific case of quantum-well confinement defining
two-dimensional layers. Based on the effective-Hamiltonian description of bulk
topological insulators, and using a harmonic-oscillator potential as an example
for a softer-than-hard-wall confinement, we have studied the interplay of band
inversion and size quantization. Our model system provides a useful platform
for systematic study of the transition between the normal and topological
phases, including the development of band inversion and the formation of
massless-Dirac-fermion surface states. The effects of bare size quantization,
two-dimensional-subband mixing, and electron-hole asymmetry are disentangled

classically by general relativity, and topological insulators are new orders of

be different objects, but in this paper, we claim that the black hole can be

dimensional $AdS_3$ spacetime we give two evidences to support this claim: the
first evidence comes from the black hole ""membrane paradigm"", which says that
the horizon of black hole behaves like an electrical conductor. On the other
hand, the vacuum can be considered as an insulator. The second evidence comes
from the fact that the horizon of BTZ black hole can support two chiral
massless scalar field with opposite chirality. Those are two key properties of
2D topological insulator. We also consider the coupling with the
electromagnetic field to show that the boundary modes can conduct the
electricity. For higher dimensional black hole the first evidence is still
valid. So we conjecture that the higher dimensional black hole can also be
considered as higher dimensional topological insulators. This conjecture will
have far-reaching influences on our understanding of quantum black hole and the

function for the away-side jet can be measured by comparing integrated
away-side yields of direct photon-hadron pairs in heavy ion collisions to those
in p+p. We measured per-trigger-yield of associated hadrons in Au+Au collisions
and observed that there is a suppression compared to p+p for higher momentum
fraction ($z_T$) hadrons. This can be explained by the opacity of the hot
medium: energetic partons from the initial hard scattering lose energy while
traversing it. A yield enhancement on the other hand has been found at low
$z_T$ (high $\xi$). Medium response is likely to be responsible for the
enhanced production of these lower momentum particles. The same measurement is

agents with heterogeneous nonlinear dynamics, where there is no constraint on
input signals. The nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics are heterogeneous,
satisfying a Lipschitz-like condition that will be defined later and is more
general than the Lipschitz condition. In the proposed algorithm, a control
input and a filter are designed for each agent. Each agent's filter has two
outputs and the idea is that the first output estimates the average of the
input signals and the second output estimates the average of the input
velocities asymptotically. In parallel, each agent's position and velocity are
driven to track, respectively, the first and the second outputs. Having
heterogeneous nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics necessitates designing the
filters for agents. Since the nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics can be
unbounded and the input signals are arbitrary, novel state-dependent
time-varying gains are employed in agents' filters and control inputs to
overcome these unboundedness effects. Finally the results are improved to
achieve the distributed average tracking for a group of double-integrator
agents, where there is no constraint on input signals and the filter is not
required anymore. Numerical simulations are also presented to illustrate the

Besides, noise in the target image is also a challenging issue especially when

Image Filtering (RGIF), which contains a data term and a smoothness term, to
solve the two issues mentioned above. The data term makes our model
simultaneously denoise the target image and perform GIF which is robust against

both the guidance image and the target image which is robust against the

be solved through the proposed Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) in
an efficient manner. For challenging applications such as guided depth map
upsampling, we further develop a data-driven parameter optimization scheme to
properly determine the parameter in our model. This optimization scheme can
help to preserve small structures and sharp depth edges even for a large
upsampling factor (8x for example). Moreover, the specially designed structure
of the data term and the smoothness term makes our model perform well in
edge-preserving smoothing for single-image tasks (i.e., the guidance image is

confined filament body, along newly-formed open field lines rooted around the
south end of the filament, and some bright plasma flowed from the north end of

lines shifted southward with multiple branches. The puff-like CME also showed
multiple bright fronts and a clear southward shift. All the results indicate an

companies, home owners, and wildlife biologists) have often led to spirited
political debates and even violent eco-terrorism. One way to transform these
conflicts into multi-stakeholder negotiations is to provide a high-fidelity
simulation environment in which stakeholders can explore the space of
alternative policies and understand the tradeoffs therein. Such an environment
needs to support fast optimization of MDP policies so that users can adjust
reward functions and analyze the resulting optimal policies. This paper
assesses the suitability of SMAC---a black-box empirical function optimization
algorithm---for rapid optimization of MDP policies. The paper describes five
reward function components and four stakeholder constituencies. It then
introduces a parameterized class of policies that can be easily understood by
the stakeholders. SMAC is applied to find the optimal policy in this class for
the reward functions of each of the stakeholder constituencies. The results
confirm that SMAC is able to rapidly find good policies that make sense from
the domain perspective. Because the full-fidelity forest fire simulator is far
too expensive to support interactive optimization, SMAC is applied to a
surrogate model constructed from a modest number of runs of the full-fidelity
simulator. To check the quality of the SMAC-optimized policies, the policies
are evaluated on the full-fidelity simulator. The results confirm that the
surrogate values estimates are valid. This is the first successful optimization
of wildfire management policies using a full-fidelity simulation. The same
methodology should be applicable to other contentious natural resource
management problems where high-fidelity simulation is extremely expensive.

  Liquid Interfaces",,,"10.1063/1.4986082",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The magnitude of the pH of the surface of water continues to be a contentious
topic in the physical chemistry of aqueous interfaces. Recent theoretical
studies have shown little or no preference for the proton to be at the surface
compared to the bulk\cite{baer2014toward}. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations, we revisit the propensity of the excess proton for the air-water
interface with a particular focus on the role of instantaneous liquid
interfaces. We find a much a stronger propensity of the proton for the surface
of water. The enhanced water structuring around the proton results in the
presence of proton wires that run parallel to the surface as well as a
hydrophobic environment made up of under-coordinated topological defect water
molecules, both of which create favorable conditions for proton confinement at
the surface. The Grotthuss mechanism within the structured water layer involves
a mixture of both concerted and closely spaced stepwise proton hops. The proton
makes excursions within the first solvation layer either in proximity to or
along the instantaneous interface.

distances, similar to a molecular force, since Jastrow proposed it in 1951. The
existence of the repulsion was experimentally confirmed from the proton-proton
scattering 1S_0 phase shift, which becomes negative beyond 230 MeV. This
repulsion is essential for preventing the nucleon-nucleon system from
collapsing by attraction. The origin of the repulsion has been considered to be
due to the Pauli principle, similar to the repulsion originally revealed in
alpha-alpha scattering, in many studies including recent lattice QCD
calculations. On the other hand, very recently it was shown that an
inter-nuclear potential including alpha-alpha interactions has a
Luneburg-lens-like attraction at short distances rather than repulsion. We show
that the nuclear force with an attractive potential at short distances that
reproduces the experimental phase shifts well has a Luneburg-lens-like
structural Pauli attractive core (SPAC) at short distances and acts as apparent
repulsion. The apparent repulsion is caused by the deeply embedded unobservable
Pauli forbidden state similar to nucleus-nucleus potentials.

functional optimization. We avoid Problem (1) by using Bethe approximation.
Bethe approximation is an approximation technique equivalent to the loopy
belief propagation. Problem (2) can be solved by using orthonormal function
expansion. Orthonormal function expansion can reduce a functional optimization
problem to a function optimization problem. Our method can provide an analytic

is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show
overall title structure and the use of proper nouns in titles are very

Chilean tsunami in rivers in Japan and a new methodology for data processing
are used to verify that tsunami dissipation in a river at each instant and
locality depends on the tidally-modified wave-locked slope of the river
surface. As deduced from the observations, a relatively small tsunami or ocean
noise traveling at mild wave-locked slopes can propagate virtually without
losses to the upstream locations where observed tidal ranges are a fraction of
that downstream; though at the higher slopes, tidal and riverine currents
combined efficiently damp the shorter waves. The observed correlations between
the tsunami admittance upriver and the traveled wave-locked slopes are
explained analytically under the fully-nonlinear shallow-water approximation.
It is found that the wave-locked slope in a purely incident wave relates to the
bottom drag in the same manner as a steady surface slope does for a stationary
flow. For a small-amplitude tsunami in the study rivers, the wave-locked slope
in a co-propagating tidal wave defines the background current and thereby
friction experienced by the tsunami.

  non-collinear spin processing",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A cluster composed of a few magnetic atoms assembled on the surface of a
nonmagnetic substrate is one suitable realization of a bit for future concepts
of spin-based information technology. The prevalent approach to achieve
magnetic stability of the bit is decoupling the cluster spin from substrate
conduction electrons in order to suppress spin-flips destabilizing the bit.
However, this route entails less flexibility in tailoring the coupling between
the bits which is ultimately needed for spin-processing. Here, we show using a
spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscope, that we can write, read, and store
spin information for hours in clusters of only three atoms strongly coupled to
a substrate featuring a cloud of non-collinearly polarized host atoms, a so
called non-collinear giant moment cluster (GMC). The GMC can be driven into a
Kondo screened state by simply moving one of its atoms to a different site.
Owing to the exceptional atomic tunability of the non-collinear substrate
mediated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, novel concepts of spin-based
information technology get within reach, as we demonstrate by a logical scheme
for a four-bit register.

particular, in the case where for each $i$, $C_i=Fix (U_i)=\{z\in \mathcal
H\mid p_i(z)=0\}$, $U_i\colon\mathcal H\rightarrow \mathcal H$ is a cutter and
$p_i\colon\mathcal H\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is a proximity function. Moreover,
we make the following assumption: the computation of $p_i$ is at most as
difficult as the evaluation of $U_i$ and this is at most as difficult as
projecting onto $C_i$. We study a double-layer fixed point algorithm which
applies two types of controls in every iteration step. The first one -- the
outer control -- is assumed to be almost cyclic. The second one -- the inner
control -- determines the most important sets from those offered by the first
one. The selection is made in terms of proximity functions. The convergence
results presented in this manuscript depend on the conditions which first, bind
together the sets, the operators and the proximity functions and second,
connect the inner and outer controls. In particular, weak regularity
(demi-closedness principle), bounded regularity and bounded linear regularity
imply weak, strong and linear convergence of our algorithm, respectively. The
framework presented in this paper covers many known (subgradient) projection
algorithms already existing in the literature; for example, those applied with
(almost) cyclic, remotest-set, maximum displacement, most-violated constraint
and simultaneous controls. In addition, we provide several new examples, where

been adequate because the undecided were comparatively small enough to assume
that they do not affect the relative proportions of the decided voters.
However, in the presence of high numbers of undecided voters, these static
rules may in fact bias election predictions from election poll authors and
meta-poll analysts. In this paper, we examine the effect of undecided voters in
the 2016 US presidential election to the previous three presidential elections.
We show there were a relatively high number of undecided voters over the
campaign and on election day, and that the allocation of undecided voters in
this election was not consistent with two-party proportional (or even)
allocations. We find evidence that static allocation regimes are inadequate for
election prediction models and that probabilistic allocations may be superior.

optically. Auto-correlation of the resonant photoluminescence and resonant
optical pumping experiments are used to study the spin relaxation channels in
this multilevel spin system. We identified for the hybrid Mn-hole spin an
efficient relaxation channel driven by the interplay of the Mn-hole exchange
interaction and the coupling to acoustic phonons. We also show that the optical
$\Lambda$ systems are connected through inefficient spin-flips than can be
enhanced under weak transverse magnetic field. The dynamics of the resonant
photoluminescence in a p-doped magnetic quantum dot is well described by a
complete rate equation model. Our results suggest that long lived hybrid
Mn-hole spin could be obtained in quantum dot systems with large
heavy-hole/light-hole splitting.

mechanism of strong interaction called confinement. In this work, the dynamics
of quarks and gluons are investigated using deeply virtual Compton scattering
(DVCS): produced by a multi-GeV electron, a highly virtual photon scatters off
the proton which subsequently radiates a high energy photon. Similarly to
holography, measuring not only the magnitude but also the phase of the DVCS
amplitude allows to perform 3D images of the internal structure of the proton.
The phase is made accessible through the quantum-mechanical interference of
DVCS with the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process, in which the final photon is emitted
by the electron rather than the proton.
  We report herein the first full determination of the BH-DVCS interference by
exploiting the distinct energy dependences of the DVCS and BH amplitudes. In
the high energy regime where the scattering process is expected to occur off a
single quark in the proton, these accurate measurements show an intriguing
sensitivity to gluons, the carriers of the strong interaction.

is studied using the total energy. At z ~ 2, the galaxies in the simulation are
evenly distributed within clusters, moving later on towards more central
locations. In this process, gas from the ICM is accreted and mixed with the gas
in the galactic halo. Simultaneously, the interaction with the environment
removes part of the gas. A characteristic stellar mass around M* ~ 10e10 Msun
appears as a threshold marking two differentiated behaviours. Below this mass,
galaxies are located at the external part of clusters and have eccentric
orbits. The effect of the interaction with the environment is marginal. Above,
galaxies are mainly located at the inner part of clusters with mostly radial
orbits with low velocities. In these massive systems, part of the gas, strongly
correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, is removed. The amount of
removed gas is sub-dominant compared with the quantity of retained gas which is
continuously influenced by the hot gas coming from the ICM. The analysis of
individual galaxies reveals the existence of a complex pattern of flows,
turbulence and a constant fuelling of gas to the hot corona from the ICM that
could make the global effect of the interaction of galaxies with their

herein, the statistical treatment of the simulation results is done within the

different temperatures that the crystal growth laws rescaled onto the waiting
times of the critically-sized nucleus follow the unified dependence, that can
simplify significantly theoretical description of the post-nucleation growth of
crystalline nuclei. The evaluated size-dependent growth rates are characterized
by transition to the steady-state growth regime, which depends on the
temperature and occurs in the glassy systems when the size of a growing nucleus
becomes two-three times larger than a critical size. It is suggested to
consider the temperature dependencies of the crystal growth rate
characteristics by using the reduced temperature scale $\widetilde{T}$. Thus,
it is revealed that the scaled values of the crystal growth rate
characteristics (namely, the steady-state growth rate and the attachment rate
for the critically-sized nucleus) as functions of the reduced temperature
$\widetilde{T}$ for glassy systems follow the unified power-law dependencies.
This finding is supported by available simulation results; the correspondence
with the experimental data for the crystal growth rate in glassy systems at the

transport from a belt of icy asteroids onto planets or embryos orbiting inside

host-star has an accompanying gas giant planet. For a comparison, we perform
two case studies where a secular resonance (SR) is located either inside the HZ
close to 1.0 au (causing eccentric motion of a planet or embryos therein) or in
the asteroid belt, beyond the snow line. In the latter case, a higher flux of
icy objects moving towards the HZ is expected. Collisions between asteroids and
objects in the HZ are treated analytically. Our purely dynamical study shows
that the SR in the HZ boosts the water transport; however, collisions can occur
at very high impact speeds. In this paper, we treat for the first time,
realistic collisions using a GPU 3D-SPH code to assess the water loss in the
projectile. Including the water loss into the dynamical results, we get more
realistic values for the water mass fraction of the asteroid during an impact.
We highlight that collisions occurring at high velocities greatly reduce the
water content of the projectile and thus the amount of water transported to
planets or embryos orbiting inside the HZ. Moreover, we discuss other effects
that could modify our results, namely the asteroid's surface rate recession due
to ice sublimation and the atmospheric drag contribution on the asteroids' mass
loss.

Quantum-Euler and for the Quantum-Navier-Stokes equations. Our results are
based on the fact that Euler-Korteweg systems and corresponding
Navier--Stokes-Korteweg systems can be reformulated through an augmented system
such as the compressible Navier-Stokes system with density dependent
viscosities satisfying the BD algebraic relation. This was also observed
recently [by D. Bresch, F. Couderc, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] for the
Euler-Korteweg system for numerical purposes. As a by-product of our analysis,
we show that this augmented formulation helps to define relative entropy
estimates for the Euler Korteweg systems in a simplest way compared to recent
works [See D. Donatelli, E. Feireisl, P. Marcati (2015) and J. Giesselmann, C.

superpositions of the electronic states of the parent ion. However, ultrafast
electron ejection triggers not only electronic but also nuclear
dynamics---leading to electronic decoherence, which is typically neglected on
time scales up to tens of femtoseconds. We propose a full quantum-dynamical
treatment of nuclear motion in an adiabatic framework, where nuclear
wavepackets move on adiabatic potential energy surfaces expanded up to second
order at the Franck-Condon point. We show that electronic decoherence is caused
by the interplay of a large number of nuclear degrees of freedom and by the
relative topology of the potential energy surfaces. Application to
$\mathrm{H_2O}$, paraxylene, and phenylalanine shows that an initially coherent
state evolves to an electronically mixed state within just a few femtoseconds.
In these examples the fast vibrations involving hydrogen atoms do not affect
electronic coherence at short times. Conversely, vibrational modes involving
the whole molecular skeleton, which are slow in the ground electronic state,
quickly destroy it upon photoionization.

magnetron sputtering. The mechanism of their growth formation is explained and
their optical properties are presented. The films grown when the level of
residual Oxygen in the background vacuum was between 5E-9Torr to 20E-9Torr
exhibit double Epsilon-Near-Zero (2-ENZ) behaviour with ENZ1 and ENZ2
wavelengths tunable in the 700-850 nm and in the 1100-1350 nm spectral ranges,
respectively. Samples fabricated when the level of residual Oxygen in the
background vacuum was above 2E-8Torr exhibit non-metallic behaviour, while the
layers deposited when the level of residual Oxygen in the background vacuum was
below 5E-9Torr, show metallic behaviour with a single ENZ value. The double ENZ
phenomenon is related to the level of residual Oxygen in the background vacuum
and is attributed to the mixture of TiN and TiOxNy/TiOx phases in the films.
Varying the partial pressure of nitrogen during the deposition can further
control the amount of TiN, TiOx and TiOxNy compounds in the films and,
therefore, tune the screened plasma wavelength. A good approximation of the
ellipsometric behaviour is achieved with Maxwell-Garnett theory for a composite
film formed by a mixture of TiO2 and TiN phases suggesting that double ENZ
TiOxNy films are formed by inclusions of TiN within a TiO2 matrix. These
oxynitride compounds could be considered as new materials exhibiting double ENZ

While conventional super-resolution aims to increase the spatial resolution of
an input image, our goal is to spectrally enhance the input, i.e., generate an
image with the same spatial resolution, but a greatly increased number of
narrow (hyper-spectral) wave-length bands. Just like the spatial statistics of
natural images has rich structure, which one can exploit as prior to predict
high-frequency content from a low resolution image, the same is also true in
the spectral domain: the materials and lighting conditions of the observed
world induce structure in the spectrum of wavelengths observed at a given
pixel. Surprisingly, very little work exists that attempts to use this
diagnosis and achieve blind spectral super-resolution from single images. We
start from the conjecture that, just like in the spatial domain, we can learn
the statistics of natural image spectra, and with its help generate finely
resolved hyper-spectral images from RGB input. Technically, we follow the
current best practice and implement a convolutional neural network (CNN), which
is trained to carry out the end-to-end mapping from an entire RGB image to the
corresponding hyperspectral image of equal size. We demonstrate spectral
super-resolution both for conventional RGB images and for multi-spectral
satellite data, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

this problem, we propose to exploit depth information to provide more invariant
body shape and skeleton information regardless of illumination and color
change. More specifically, we exploit depth voxel covariance descriptor and
further propose a locally rotation invariant depth shape descriptor called
Eigen-depth feature to describe pedestrian body shape. We prove that the
distance between any two covariance matrices on the Riemannian manifold is
equivalent to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding Eigen-depth
features. Furthermore, we propose a kernelized implicit feature transfer scheme
to estimate Eigen-depth feature implicitly from RGB image when depth
information is not available. We find that combining the estimated depth
features with RGB-based appearance features can sometimes help to better reduce
visual ambiguities of appearance features caused by illumination and similar
clothes. The effectiveness of our models was validated on publicly available
depth pedestrian datasets as compared to related methods for person

  Accuracy Comparison with Default Settings",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are now a broad range of time series classification (TSC) algorithms
designed to exploit different representations of the data. These have been
evaluated on a range of problems hosted at the UCR-UEA TSC Archive
(www.timeseriesclassification.com), and there have been extensive comparative
studies. However, our understanding of why one algorithm outperforms another is
still anecdotal at best. This series of experiments is meant to help provide
insights into what sort of discriminatory features in the data lead one set of
algorithms that exploit a particular representation to be better than other
algorithms. We categorise five different feature spaces exploited by TSC
algorithms then design data simulators to generate randomised data from each
representation. We describe what results we expected from each class of
algorithm and data representation, then observe whether these prior beliefs are
supported by the experimental evidence. We provide an open source
implementation of all the simulators to allow for the controlled testing of
hypotheses relating to classifier performance on different data
representations. We identify many surprising results that confounded our
expectations, and use these results to highlight how an over simplified view of
classifier structure can often lead to erroneous prior beliefs. We believe
ensembling can often overcome prior bias, and our results support the belief by
showing that the ensemble approach adopted by the Hierarchical Collective of
Transform based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE) is significantly better than the
alternatives when the data representation is unknown, and is significantly
better than, or not significantly significantly better than, or not
significantly worse than, the best other approach on three out of five of the
individual simulators.

from full quantum dynamics to various flavours of semiclassical or ab initio
molecular dynamics, each with its advantages and its limitations. As this
contribution shows, the most common approach employed up-to-date to learn about
the deactivation of nucleobases in gas phase is a combination of the Tully
surface hopping algorithm with on-the-fly CASSCF calculations. Different
methods or, even more dramatically, different electronic structure methods can
provide different dynamics. A comprehensive review of the different mechanisms
suggested for each nucleobase is provided and compared to available
experimental time scales. The results are discussed in a general context
involving the effects of the different applied electronic structure and
dynamics methods. Mechanistic similarities and differences between the two
groups of nucleobases---the purine derivatives (adenine and guanine) and the
pyrimidine derivatives (thymine, uracil, and cytosine)---are elucidated.
Finally, a perspective on the future of dynamics simulations in the context of
nucleobase relaxation is given.

classical linear analyses of spatio-temporal gait parameters. Here, we use more
advanced, yet not less practical, non-linear techniques to analyse gait time
series of healthy subjects. We aimed at finding more sensitive indexes related
to spatio-temporal gait parameters than those previously used, with the hope to
better identify abnormal locomotion. We analysed large-scale stride interval
time series and mean step width in 34 participants while altering walking
direction (forward vs. backward walking) and with or without galvanic
vestibular stimulation. The Hurst exponent $\alpha$ and the Minkowski fractal
dimension $D$ were computed and interpreted as indexes expressing
predictability and complexity of stride interval time series, respectively. We
show that $\alpha$ and $D$ accurately capture stride interval changes in
function of the experimental condition. Walking forward exhibited maximal
complexity ($D$) and hence, adaptability. In contrast, any perturbation
(walking backward and/or stimulation of the vestibular system) decreased it.
Furthermore, walking backward increased predictability ($\alpha$) through a
more stereotyped pattern of the stride interval and galvanic vestibular
stimulation reduced predictability. The present study demonstrates the
complementary power of the Hurst exponent and the fractal dimension to improve
walking classification. These holistic indexes can easily be interpreted in the
framework of optimal movement complexity. Our developments may have immediate
applications in rehabilitation, diagnosis, and classification procedures.

proposal is confirmed by numerical calculations, indicating that near-perfect
invisibility can be attained for arbitrary objects with low-index contrast. We
further demonstrate the cases where the idea can be extended to high-index
objects or restricted to within practical limits by avoiding gain areas. The
proposed concept opens a new route for the practical implementation of
complex-shaped objects with arbitrarily suppressed scatterings determined on

upper limit on the quiescent X-ray luminosity of SXT 1H 1905+000 suggests that

radio pulsations would link SXTs more strongly with tMSPs; and thus e.g. put
stricter constraints on tMSP transitional timescales, through the connection
with the well-known SXT periods of quiescence. A non-detection allows us, based
on the telescope sensitivity, to estimate how likely these sources are to
pulsate in radio. Over a ten-year span, 2006-2015, we carried out targeted
radio observations at 400/800 MHz with Arecibo, and searched for radio
pulsations from the quiescent SXT 1H 1905+000. None of the observations have
revealed radio pulsations from the targeted SXT. For a 1-ms pulsar our flux
density upper limit is 10.3 $\rm{\mu}$Jy. At an assumed distance of 10 kpc this
translates to a pseudo-luminosity upper limit of 1.0 mJy kpc$^2$, which makes
our search complete to $\sim85$% of the known MSP population. Given the high
sensitivity, and the generally large beaming fraction of millisecond pulsars,
we conclude that SXT 1H 1905+000 is unlikely to emit in radio as a transitional
millisecond pulsar.

new dimension reduction algorithm on SPD matrix space to transform
high-dimensional SPD matrices into low-dimensional SPD matrices. Our work is
based on the fact that the set of all SPD matrices with the same size has a Lie
group structure, and we aim to transform the manifold learning to the SPD

non-constant under extreme market conditions in a single factor setting; on the
other hand, they are not significantly different from the linear estimates of
the Fama-French three-factor model. If we extend the single factor model with
the Fama-French factors, the simple linear model is able to explain the US

undergo phase transitions that are characterised by changes in the structures

macroscopic loops. There are many such loops, and the joint distribution of
their lengths is always given by a {\it Poisson-Dirichlet distribution}.
  This distribution concerns random partitions and it is not widely known in
statistical physics. We introduce it explicitly, and we explain that it is the
invariant measure of a mean-field split-merge process. It is relevant to
spatial models because the macroscopic loops are so intertwined that they
behave effectively in mean-field fashion. This heuristics can be made exact and
it allows to calculate the parameter of the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. We
discuss consequences about symmetry breaking in certain quantum spin systems.

Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience
interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually
switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR,
an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a

challenges in pattern mining. This challenge is approached by introducing a
constraint for pattern selection. One of the first constraints proposed in
pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is
an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its
superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern
selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to
generate patterns satisfying these constraints.
  In order to deal with nonmonotonic constraints we introduce the notion of
""projection antimonotonicity"" and SOFIA algorithm that allow generating best
patterns for a class of nonmonotonic constraints. Cosine interest, robustness,
stability of closed itemsets, and the associated delta-measure are among these
constraints. SOFIA starts from light descriptions of transactions in dataset (a
small set of items in the case of itemset description) and then iteratively
adds more information to these descriptions (more items with indication of

are also used. These models appear at first sight to be very different, but
here it is shown that they all may be expressed in terms of elementary
viscoelastic models.
  For a medium expressed with fractional models, many elementary spring-damper
combinations are added, each of them weighted according to a long-tailed
distribution, hinting at a fractional distribution of time constants or
relaxation frequencies. This may open up for a more physical interpretation of
the fractional models.
  The shear wave component of the poroelastic model is shown to be modeled
exactly by a three-component Zener model. The extended poroviscoelastic model
is found to be equivalent to what is called a non-standard four-parameter
model. Accordingly, the large number of parameters in the porous models can be
reduced to the same number as in their viscoelastic equivalents. As long as the
individual displacements from the solid and fluid parts cannot be measured
individually the main use of the poro(visco)elastic models is therefore as a
physics based method for determining parameters in a viscoelastic model.

non-equilibrium time evolution in integrable models (and in particular in the
XXZ spin chain) can be described by the so-called Generalized Gibbs Ensemble
(GGE). It is known that the micro-canonical ensemble built on a complete set of
charges correctly describes the long-time limit of local observables, and
recently a canonical ensemble was built by Ilievski et. al. using particle
occupation number operators. Here we provide an alternative construction by
considering truncated GGE's (tGGE's) that only include a finite number of well
localized conserved operators. It is shown that the tGGE's can approximate the
steady states with arbitrary precision, i.e. all physical observables are
exactly reproduced in the infinite truncation limit. In addition, we show that
a complete canonical ensemble can in fact be built in terms of a new (discrete)
set of charges built as linear combinations of the standard ones.
  Our general arguments are applied to concrete quench situations in the XXZ
chain, where the initial states are simple two-site or four-site product
states. Depending on the quench we find that numerical results for the local
correlators can be obtained with remarkable precision using truncated GGE's

coextrusion through a series of layer multiplying elements. Different films
composed of alternating layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and
polystyrene (PS) were fabricated with the aim to reach individual layer
thicknesses as small as possible, varying the number of layers, the mass
composition of both components and the final total thickness of the film. Films
were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and a statistical analysis
was used to determine the distribution in layer thicknesses and the continuity
of layers. For the PS/PMMA nanolayered systems, results point out the existence
of a critical layer thickness around 10 nm, below which the layers break up.
This critical layer thickness is reached regardless of the processing route,
suggesting it might be dependent only on material characteristics but not on

XML nodes and XPath relationships satisfied between them. A lot of TPQ types
have been proposed; this paper takes into account a TPQ model extended by a
specification of output and non-output query nodes since it complies with the
XQuery semantics and, in many cases, it leads to a more efficient query
processing. In general, there are two approaches to process the TPQ: holistic
joins and binary joins. Whereas the binary join approach builds a query plan as
a tree of interconnected binary operators, the holistic join approach evaluates
a whole query using one operator (i.e., using one complex algorithm).
Surprisingly, a thorough analytical and experimental comparison is still
missing despite an enormous research effort in this area. In this paper, we try
to fill this gap; we analytically and experimentally show that the binary joins
used in a fully-pipelined plan (i.e., the plan where each join operation does
not wait for the complete result of the previous operation and no explicit
sorting is used) can often outperform the holistic joins, especially for TPQs
with a higher ratio of non-output query nodes. The main contributions of this
paper can be summarized as follows: (i) we introduce several improvements of
existing binary join approaches allowing to build a fully-pipelined plan for a
TPQ considering non-output query nodes, (ii) we prove that for a certain class
of TPQs such a plan has the linear time complexity with respect to the size of
the input and output as well as the linear space complexity with respect to the
XML document depth (i.e., the same complexity as the holistic join approaches),
(iii) we show that our improved binary join approach outperforms the holistic
join approaches in many situations, and (iv) we propose a simple combined
approach that uses advantages of both types of approaches.

graphs. However, it can be tricky to implement graph algorithms correctly and
efficiently in Pregel's vertex-centric model, especially when the algorithm has
multiple computation stages, complicated data dependencies, or even
communication over dynamic internal data structures. Some domain-specific
languages (DSLs) have been proposed to provide more intuitive ways to implement
graph algorithms, but due to the lack of support for remote access --- reading
or writing attributes of other vertices through references --- they cannot
handle the above mentioned dynamic communication, causing a class of Pregel
algorithms with fast convergence impossible to implement.
  To address this problem, we design and implement Palgol, a more declarative
and powerful DSL which supports remote access. In particular, programmers can
use a more declarative syntax called chain access to naturally specify dynamic
communication as if directly reading data on arbitrary remote vertices. By
analyzing the logic patterns of chain access, we provide a novel algorithm for
compiling Palgol programs to efficient Pregel code. We demonstrate the power of
Palgol by using it to implement several practical Pregel algorithms, and the

transit depth and host star brightness. The focus on this object has produced a
number of high-cadence transit observations using high-resolution optical
spectrographs. Here we present an analysis of seven full H$\alpha$ transits of
HD 189733 b using HARPS on the 3.6 meter La Silla telescope and HIRES on Keck
I, taken over the course of nine years from 2006 to 2015. H$\alpha$
transmission signals are analyzed as a function of the stellar activity level,
as measured using the normalized core flux of the Ca II H and K lines. We find
strong variations in the strength of the H$\alpha$ transmission spectrum from
epoch to epoch. However, there is no clear trend between the Ca II core
emission and the strength of the in-transit H$\alpha$ signal, although the
transit showing the largest absorption value also occurs when the star is the
most active. We present simulations of the in-transit contrast effect and find
that the planet must consistently transit active latitudes with very strong
facular and plage emission regions in order to reproduce the observed line
strengths. We also investigate the measured velocity centroids with models of
planetary rotation and show that the small line profile velocities could be due
to large velocities in the upper atmosphere of the planet. Overall, we find it
more likely that the measured H$\alpha$ signals arise in the extended planetary
atmosphere, although a better understanding of active region emission for
active stars such as HD 189733 are needed.

SgrB2(N) is one of its main centers of activity. It hosts several compact and
UCHII regions, as well as two known hot molecular cores (SgrB2(N1) and
SgrB2(N2)), where complex organic molecules are detected. Our goal is to use
the high sensitivity of ALMA to characterize the hot core population in
SgrB2(N) and shed a new light on the star formation process. We use a complete
3 mm spectral line survey conducted with ALMA to search for faint hot cores in
SgrB2(N). We report the discovery of three new hot cores that we call
SgrB2(N3), SgrB2(N4), and SgrB2(N5). The three sources are associated with
class II methanol masers, well known tracers of high-mass star formation, and
SgrB2(N5) also with a UCHII region. The chemical composition of the sources and
the column densities are derived by modelling the whole spectra under the
assumption of LTE. The H2 column densities are computed from ALMA and SMA
continuum emission maps. The H2 column densities of these new hot cores are
found to be 16 up to 36 times lower than the one of the main hot core Sgr
B2(N1). Their spectra have spectral line densities of 11 up to 31 emission
lines per GHz, assigned to 22-25 molecules. We derive rotational temperatures
around 140-180 K for the three new hot cores and mean source sizes of 0.4 for
SgrB2(N3) and 1.0 for SgrB2(N4) and SgrB2(N5). SgrB2(N3) and SgrB2(N5) show
high velocity wing emission in typical outflow tracers, with a bipolar
morphology in their integrated intensity maps suggesting the presence of an
outflow, like in SgrB2(N1). The associations of the hot cores with class II
methanol masers, outflows, and/or UCHII regions tentatively suggest the
following age sequence: SgrB2(N4), SgrB2(N3), SgrB2(N5), SgrB2(N1). The status
of SgrB2(N2) is unclear. It may contain two distinct sources, a UCHII region
and a very young hot core.

is surprisingly rich, generalising results found in GR or in related
scalar-tensor theories. We investigate the properties and conserved charges of
black holes, using both analytical and numerical techniques, highlighting
configurations that are more compact than in GR. We then study properties of
neutron stars, showing how the vector profile can influence the star internal
structure. Depending on properties of matter and fields inside the star,
neutron stars can be more massive than in GR, and they can be even more compact
than Schwarzschild black holes, making these objects observationally
interesting. We also comment on possible extensions of our configurations to

develop synthetic X-ray synchrotron orbital light curves and explore the model
parameter space allowed by radio eclipse constraints applied on archetypal

stand-off is $R_0 \sim 0.15$ -- $0.3$ fraction of binary separation from the
companion center, depending on the orbit inclination. Constructed X-ray light
curves for B1957+20 using these values are qualitatively consistent with those
observed, and we find occultation of the shock by the companion as a minor
influence, demanding significant Doppler factors to yield double peaks. For
J1023+0038, radio eclipses imply $R_0 \lesssim 0.4$ while X-ray light curves
suggest $0.1\lesssim R_0 \lesssim 0.3$ (from the pulsar). Degeneracies in the

  size","38 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human populations have a complex history of introgression and of changing
population size. Human genetic variation has been affected by both these
processes, so that inference of past population size depends upon the pattern
of gene flow and introgression among past populations. One remarkable aspect of
human population history as inferred from genetics is a consistent ""wave"" of
larger effective population size, prior to the bottlenecks and expansions of
the last 100,000 years. Here I carry out a series of simulations to investigate
how introgression and gene flow from genetically divergent ancestral
populations affect the inference of ancestral effective population size. Both
introgression and gene flow from an extinct, genetically divergent population
consistently produce a wave in the history of inferred effective population
size. The time and amplitude of the wave reflect the time of origin of the
genetically divergent ancestral populations and the strength of introgression
or gene flow. These results demonstrate that even small fractions of
introgression or gene flow from ancient populations may have large effects on
the inference of effective population size.

revamp our verification scheme in two distinct ways using fault tolerance that

correction with the same threshold as universal quantum computation. The second
has a higher overhead but an improved threshold (1.97\%) based on error
detection. We show that classically sampling upto additive errors is likely

both transmission delay and queueing delay are considered. With short
transmission time, the blocklength of channel codes is finite, and the Shannon
Capacity cannot be used to characterize the maximal achievable rate with given
transmission error probability. With randomly arrived packets, some packets may
violate the queueing delay. Moreover, since the queueing delay is shorter than
the channel coherence time in typical scenarios, the required transmit power to
guarantee the queueing delay and transmission error probability will become
unbounded even with spatial diversity. To ensure the required
quality-of-service (QoS) with finite transmit power, a proactive packet
dropping mechanism is introduced. Then, the overall packet loss probability
includes transmission error probability, queueing delay violation probability,
and packet dropping probability. We optimize the packet dropping policy, power
allocation policy, and bandwidth allocation policy to minimize the transmit
power under the QoS constraint. The optimal solution is obtained, which depends
on both channel and queue state information. Simulation and numerical results
validate our analysis, and show that setting packet loss probabilities equal is
a near optimal solution.

emission of an even number of IR laser photons is responsible for the
characteristic sidebands in the perpendicular direction separated by twice the
IR photon energy. We analyze the dependence of the energy spectrum on the laser
intensity and the time delay between the XUV pulse and the IR laser. Finally,
we show that our semiclassical simulations are in very good agreement with
quantum calculations within the strong field approximation and the numerical
solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation.

is crucial to optimizing the functionality of these systems in real
physiological applications. Here we address this problem for a specific, yet
representative, system. We present an experimental and analytical study on the
aggregation of superparamagnetic liposomes in suspension in the presence of a
controllable external magnetic field. We study the aggregation kinetics and
report an intermediate time power law evolution and a long time stationary
value for the average aggregate diffusion coefficient, both depending on the
magnetic field intensity. We then show that the long time aggregate structure
is fractal with a fractal dimension that decreases upon increasing the magnetic
field intensity. By scaling arguments we also establish an analytical relation
between the aggregate fractal dimension and the power law exponent controlling
the aggregation kinetics. This relation is indeed independent on the magnetic
field intensity. Despite the superparamagnetic character of our particles, we
further prove the existence of a population of surviving aggregates able to
maintain their integrity after switching off the external magnetic field.
Finally, we suggest a schematic interaction scenario to rationalize the
observed coexistence between reversible and irreversible aggregation.

generalization of cubic splines to manifolds is not self-evident, with several
distinct approaches. One possibility is to mimic the acceleration minimizing
property, which leads to Riemannian cubics. This, however, require the solution
of a coupled set of non-linear boundary value problems that cannot be

convergence of linear order. In terms of numerical tractability and
computational efficiency, the new method surpasses those based on Riemannian

theoretical framework for the formation of the cosmic web, and specifically
those aspects that characterize its unique nature: its complex topological
connectivity and multiscale spinal structure of sheetlike membranes, elongated
filaments and compact cluster nodes. The present work represents an extension
of the work by Arnol'd et al., who classified the caustics for the 1- and
2-dimensional Zel'dovich approximation. His seminal work established the role
of emerging singularities in the formation of nonlinear structures in the
universe. At the transition from the linear to nonlinear structure evolution,
the first complex features emerge at locations where different fluid elements
cross to establish multistream regions. The classification and characterization
of these mass element foldings can be encapsulated in caustic conditions on the
eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the deformation tensor field. We introduce
an alternative and transparent proof for Lagrangian catastrophe theory, and
derive the caustic conditions for general Lagrangian fluids, with arbitrary
dynamics, including dissipative terms and vorticity. The new proof allows us to
describe the full 3-dimensional complexity of the gravitationally evolving
cosmic matter field. One of our key findings is the significance of the
eigenvector field of the deformation field for outlining the spatial structure
of the caustic skeleton. We consider the caustic conditions for the
3-dimensional Zel'dovich approximation, extending earlier work on those for 1-
and 2-dimensional fluids towards the full spatial richness of the cosmic web.

loose on a given graph. The zombies randomly choose their initial location, and
during the course of the game, move directly toward the survivor. At each
round, they move to the neighbouring vertex that minimizes the distance to the
survivor; if there is more than one such vertex, then they choose one uniformly
at random. The survivor attempts to escape from the zombies by moving to a
neighbouring vertex or staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if
eventually one of them eats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise,
the survivor wins. The zombie number of a graph is the minimum number of
zombies needed to play such that the probability that they win is at least 1/2.
  This variant of the game was recently investigated for several graph
families, such as cycles, hypercubes, incidence graphs of projective planes,
and grids $P_n \square P_n$. However, unfortunately, still very little is known
for toroidal grids $C_n \square C_n$: the zombie number of $C_n \square C_n$ is
at least $\sqrt n/(\omega\log n)$, where $\omega = \omega(n)$ is any function
going to infinity as $n \to \infty$, and no upper bound is known except a
trivial bound of $O(n^2 \log n)$. In this note, we provide an approach that

require either skeleton joints or hand-crafted depth features as inputs. An
end-to-end manner, mapping from raw depth maps to action classes, is
non-trivial to design due to the fact that: 1) single channel map lacks texture
thus weakens the discriminative power; 2) relatively small set of depth
training data. To address these challenges, we propose to learn an RNN driven
by privileged information (PI) in three-steps: An encoder is pre-trained to
learn a joint embedding of depth appearance and PI (i.e. skeleton joints). The
learned embedding layers are then tuned in the learning step, aiming to
optimize the network by exploiting PI in a form of multi-task loss. However,
exploiting PI as a secondary task provides little help to improve the
performance of a primary task (i.e. classification) due to the gap between
them. Finally, a bridging matrix is defined to connect two tasks by discovering
latent PI in the refining step. Our PI-based classification loss maintains a
consistency between latent PI and predicted distribution. The latent PI and
network are iteratively estimated and updated in an expectation-maximization
procedure. The proposed learning process provides greater discriminative power
to model subtle depth difference, while helping avoid overfitting the scarcer
training data. Our experiments show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmark datasets and our newly
collected Blanket dataset.

a dispersion parameter are proposed. The estimators are based on three steps.
In the first step the maximum rank correlation estimator is used to
consistently estimate the slopes up to a scale factor. In the second step, the
scale factor, the intercept, and the dispersion parameter are consistently
estimated using a MT-estimator of a simple regression model. The combined
estimator is highly robust but inefficient. Then, randomized quantile residuals
based on the initial estimators are used to detect outliers to be rejected and
to define a set S of observations to be retained. Finally, a conditional
maximum likelihood (CML) estimator given the observations in S is computed. We
show that, under the model, S tends to the complete sample for increasing
sample size. Therefore, the CML tends to the unconditional maximum likelihood
estimator. It is therefore highly efficient, while maintaining the high degree
of robustness of the initial estimator. The case of the negative binomial
regression model is studied in detail.

Factorization (NMF) objective function for text clustering and the Symmetric
NMF (SymNMF) objective function for graph clustering. We propose an effective
algorithm for the joint NMF objective function, based on a block coordinate
descent (BCD) framework. The proposed hybrid method discovers content
associations via latent connections found using SymNMF. The method can also be
applied with a natural conversion of the problem when a hypergraph formulation
is used or the content is associated with hypergraph edges.
  Experimental results show that by simultaneously utilizing both content and
connection structure, our hybrid method produces higher quality clustering
results compared to the other NMF clustering methods that uses content alone
(standard NMF) or connection structure alone (SymNMF). We also present some
interesting applications to several types of real world data such as citation

applied to general data expressed with both feature space vectors and pairwise

they have an underlying discrete irreversible evolution, but in the long term
exhibit the properties of a time reversible system, in the form of limit

unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time O(dt^2) and to compute
explicitly the solution at each time step, avoiding costly sub-iterations. This
approach may reduce the computational cost by twenty, as well as it may enable
perfect synchronism for whole-building simulation and co-simulation.

segmented silicon sensors fabricated on high-ohmic $p$-type silicon are
$p^+$-implants. Although the knowledge of the $p^+$-implant dose and of the
doping profile is highly relevant for the understanding and optimisation of
sensors, this information is usually not available from the vendors, and
methods to obtain it are highly welcome. The paper presents methods to obtain
this information from circular MOSFETs fabricated as test structures on the
same wafer as the sensors. Two circular MOSFETs, one with and one without a
$p^+$-implant under the gate, are used for this study. They were produced on
Magnetic Czochralski silicon doped with $\approx 3.5 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$
of boron and $\langle 1 0 0 \, \rangle$ crystal orientation. The drain-source
current as function of gate voltage for different back-side voltages is
measured at a drain-source voltage of 50 mV in the linear MOSFET region, and
the values of threshold voltage and mobility extracted using the standard
MOSFET formulae. To determine the bulk doping, the implantation dose and
profile from the data, two methods are used, which give compatible results. The
doping profile, which varies between $3.5 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $2
\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the MOSFET with $p^+$-implant, is determined down
to a distance of a fraction of a $\mu $m from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. The
method of extracting the doping profiles is verified using data from a TCAD
simulation of the two MOSFETs. The details of the methods and of the problems
encountered are discussed.

sources and detectors, have traditionally relied on frequency bandwidth to
retrieve range information, while using mechanical or electronic beamsteering
to obtain cross-range information. This approach has resulted in complex and
expensive hardware when extended to large-scale systems requiring ultrawide
bandwidth. Relying on bandwidth can create difficulties in calibration,
alignment, and imaging of dispersive objects. We present an alternative
approach using an electrically-large, dynamically reconfigurable, metasurface
antenna that generates spatially-distinct radiation patterns as a function of
tuning state. The metasurface antenna comprises a waveguide feeding an array of
metamaterial radiators, each of whose properties can be modified by applying a
voltage to a diode integrated into the element. By deploying two of these
apertures, one as the transmitter and one as the receiver, we realize
sufficient spatial diversity to alleviate the dependence on frequency bandwidth
and obtain both range and cross-range information using measurements at a
single frequency. We demonstrate the method experimentally, using
one-dimensional dynamic metasurface apertures and reconstructing various
two-dimensional scenes (range and cross-range). Furthermore, we modify a
conventional microwave imaging technique---the range migration algorithm---to
be compatible with such configurations, resulting in an imaging system that is
fast and simple in both software and hardware. The imaging scheme presented in
this paper has broad application to radio frequency imaging, including security
screening, through-wall imaging, biomedical diagnostics, and synthetic aperture
radar.

counter-propagating laser beams. Special emphasis is on the discussion of the
time evolution of the system that exhibits the characteristics of a

entropy and particle density of the system. We give an outlook to applications

Last but not least, our bindings have been designed to platform-independent and
