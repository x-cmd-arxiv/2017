Algebra",,,,"math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A group is $\frac{3}{2}$-generated if every non-identity element is contained
in a generating pair. A conjecture of Breuer, Guralnick and Kantor from 2008
asserts that a finite group is $\frac{3}{2}$-generated if and only if every
proper quotient of the group is cyclic, and recent work of Guralnick reduces
this conjecture to almost simple groups. In this paper, we prove a stronger
form of the conjecture for almost simple symplectic and odd-dimensional
orthogonal groups. More generally, we study the uniform spread of these groups,
obtaining lower bounds and related asymptotics. This builds on earlier work of
Burness and Guest, who established the conjecture for almost simple linear
groups.

partly obscures an emission line region by assuming virialized gas in the
emission region surrounding a supermassive black hole with known mass. When a
spiky Lya1216 line emission is present at the flat bottom of the deep Nv1240

quasars in the SDSS database showing such Lya lines. The scale of their BAL
outflows are found to be 3-26 pc, moderately larger than the theoretical scale
(0.01-0.1 pc) of trough forming regions for winds originating from accretion
discs, but significantly smaller than most outflow sizes derived using the
absorption troughs of the excited states of ions. For these three outflows, the
lower limits of ratio of kinetic luminosity to Eddington luminosity are
0.02%-0.07%. These lower limits are substantially smaller than that is required
to have significant feedback effect on their host galaxies.

bacteria forgo a single cell lifestyle for a communal lifestyle hallmarked by
high cell density and physical interactions between cells potentially altering
their behaviour. It is thus crucial to understand how initially identical
single cells start to behave differently while assembling in these tight
communities. Here we show that cells in the microcolonies formed by the human

within an hour upon colony formation. Observation of merging microcolonies and
tracking of single cells within microcolonies reveal a heterogeneous motility
behavior: cells close to the surface of the microcolony exhibit a much higher
motility compared to cells towards the center. Numerical simulations of a
biophysical model for the microcolonies at the single cell level suggest that
the emergence of differential behavior within a multicellular microcolony of
otherwise identical cells is of mechanical origin. It could suggest a route
toward further bacterial differentiation and ultimately mature biofilms.

monotonically at a rate consistent with the action of radiation pressure
sweeping. The individual components exhibit comet-like morphologies and also
fade except where secondary fragmentation is accompanied by the release of

the components of P/2013 R3 would form a single spherical body with radius

applications of collaborative consumption systems. The agents generate a random
amount of spare resource that they can exchange with their one-hop neighbours,
seeking to maximize the amount of desirable resource items they receive in the
long run. We study this system from three different perspectives: a) the
central designer who seeks the resource allocation that achieves the most fair
endowments after the exchange; b) the game theoretic where the nodes seek to
form sharing coalitions within teams, attempting to maximize the benefit of
their team only; c) the market where the nodes are engaged in trade with their
neighbours trying to improve their own benefit. It is shown that there is a
unique family of sharing allocations that are at the same time most fair,
stable with respect to continuous coalition formation among the nodes and
achieving equilibrium in the market perspective. A dynamic sharing policy is
given then where each node observes the sharing rates of its neighbours and
allocates its resource accordingly. That policy is shown to achieve long term
sharing ratios that are within the family of equilibrium allocations of the

designs the transmit covariance matrix to maximize its information rate. When
passive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesters are present in the network, the
transmissions are constrained by both the transmit power limits and the energy
harvesting requirements. A passive RF energy harvester collects the radiated
energy from nearby wireless information transmitters instead of using a
dedicated wireless power source. It needs multiple transmitters to concentrate
their RF radiation on it because typical electric field strengths are weak. In
this paper, strategic games are proposed for the multi-user transmissions.
First, in a non-cooperative game, each transmitter has a best-response strategy
for the transmit covariance matrix that follows a multi-level water-filling
solution. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists. Secondly, in a cooperative
game, there is no need to estimate the proportion of the harvested energy from
each transmitter. Rather, the transmitters bargain over the unit-reward of the
energy contribution. An approximation of the information rate is used in
constructing the individual utility such that the problem of network utility
maximization can be decomposed and the bargaining process can be implemented
distributively. The bargaining solution gives a point of rates that is superior
to the Nash equilibria and close to the Pareto front. Simulation results verify
the algorithms that provide good communication performance while satisfying the
RF energy-harvesting requirements.

by INAF (Italy). Its active surface will allow us to observe at frequencies of
up to 116 GHz. At the moment, three receivers, one per focal position, have
been installed and tested. The SRT was officially opened in October 2013, upon
completion of its technical commissioning phase. In this paper, we provide an
overview of the main science drivers for the SRT, describe the main outcomes
from the scientific commissioning of the telescope, and discuss a set of
observations demonstrating the SRT's scientific capabilities. One of the main
objectives of scientific commissioning was the identification of deficiencies
in the instrumentation and/or in the telescope sub-systems for further
optimization. As a result, the overall telescope performance has been
significantly improved. As part of the scientific commissioning activities,
different observing modes were tested and validated, and first astronomical
observations were carried out to demonstrate the science capabilities of the
SRT. In addition, we developed astronomer-oriented software tools, to support
future observers on-site. The astronomical validation activities were
prioritized based on technical readiness and scientific impact. The highest
priority was to make the SRT available for joint observations as part of
European networks. As a result, the SRT started to participate (in shared-risk
mode) in EVN (European VLBI Network) and LEAP (Large European Array for
Pulsars) observing sessions in early 2014. The validation of single-dish
operations for the suite of SRT first light receivers and backends continued in
the following years, and was concluded with the first call for
shared-risk/early-science observations issued at the end of 2015.

candidate for dark matter in the Universe. Its phenomenological property is
strongly affected by the gaugino fraction in the Higgsino-like state. If this
is sizable, in other words, if gaugino masses are less than ${\cal O}(10)$ TeV,
we may probe the Higgsino dark matter in future non-accelerator experiments
such as dark matter direct searches and measurements of electric dipole
moments. On the other hand, if gauginos are much heavier, then it is hard to
search for Higgsino in these experiments. In this case, due to a lack of
gaugino components, the mass difference between the neutral and charged
Higgsinos is uniquely determined by electroweak interactions to be around $350$
MeV, which makes the heavier charged state rather long-lived, with a decay
length of about $1$ cm. In this letter, we argue that a charged particle with a
flight length of ${\cal O}(1)$ cm can be probed in disappearing-track searches
if we require only two hits in the pixel detector. Even in this case, we can
reduce background events with the help of the displaced-vertex reconstruction
technique. We study the prospects of this search strategy at the LHC and future
colliders for the Higgsino dark matter scenario. It is found that an almost
pure Higgsino is indeed within the reach of the future $33$ TeV collider
experiments. We then discuss that the interplay among collider and
non-accelerator experiments plays a crucial role in testing the Higgsino dark
matter scenarios. Our strategy for disappearing-track searches can also enlarge
the discovery potential of pure wino dark matter as well as other
electroweak-charged dark matter candidates.

IIn showing a light curve with five bumps during its decline phase. The bumps
had amplitudes between 0.4 and 0.9 mag and durations between 20 and 120 days.
The most prominent bumps appeared in all our different optical bands. The
spectra showed typical SN IIn characteristics, with emission lines of H$\alpha$
(with broad component FWHM ~$10^{3}-10^{4} ~{\rm ~km ~s^{-1}}$ and narrow
component FWHM ~$10^2 \rm ~km ~s^{-1}$) and He I, but also with Fe II, Ca II,
Na I D and H$\beta$ P-Cygni profiles (with velocities of ~$10^{3}$ ${\rm ~km

with $M_r \approx -15$ mag around 210 days before discovery. Large, variable
progenitor mass-loss rates (~> 0.01 $M_{\odot} \rm ~yr^{-1}$) and CSM densities

of iPTF13z arose from SN ejecta interacting with denser regions in the CSM,
possibly produced by the eruptions of a luminous blue variable star.

isotropization time (when the longitudinal and transverse pressures approach

can occur in several different orderings. In particular, the condensate can
remain far from equilibrium even long after the plasma has hydrodynamized and
EoSized. We also explore the rapidity distribution of the energy density at
hydrodynamization. This is far from boost-invariant and its width decreases as
the non-conformality increases. Nevertheless, the velocity field at
hydrodynamization is almost exactly boost-invariant regardless of the
non-conformality. This result may be used to constrain the initialization of
hydrodynamic fields in heavy ion collisions.

Since torsion can potentially affect interesting phenomena such as
gravitational waves and early Universe inflation, in this paper we allow
torsion to exist and propagate within the Horndeski framework. To achieve this
goal, we cast the Horndeski Lagrangian in Cartan's first-order formalism, and
introduce wave operators designed to act covariantly on p-form fields that
carry Lorentz indices. We find that nonminimal couplings and second-order

computational costs with competitive performance in comparison with the

contraction drives intracellular flows, and these flows transport the chemical
signals that regulate contraction in the first place. As a consequence of these
non-linear interactions, a diversity of migratory behaviors can be observed in
migrating \phys fragments. To study these dynamics, we measure the
spatio-temporal distributions of the velocities of the endoplasm and ectoplasm
of each migrating fragment, the traction stresses it generates on the
substratum, and the concentration of free intracellular calcium. Using these
unprecedented experimental data, we classify migrating \phys fragments
according to their dynamics, finding that they often exhibit spontaneously
coordinated waves of flow, contractility and chemical signaling. We show that
\phys fragments exhibiting symmetric spatio-temporal patterns of endoplasmic
flow migrate significantly slower than fragments with asymmetric patterns. In
addition, our joint measurements of ectoplasm velocity and traction stress at
the substratum suggest that forward motion of the ectoplasm is enabled by a
succession of stick-slip transitions, which we conjecture are also organized in
the form of waves. Combining our experiments with a simplified
convection-diffusion model, we show that the convective transport of calcium
ions may be key for establishing and maintaining the spatio-temporal patterns
of calcium concentration that regulate the generation of contractile forces.

unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and on the other hand, non-real images
created through Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we propose a

assigns sample a label y from the K possible classes or marks it as a fake

forces real samples to be close in the feature space, enabling a bottom-up
clustering process, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification.
To ensure higher quality of generated images for GANs with consequent improved
pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated

secondary effects from gluons splitting into heavy-quark pairs. To be specific,
we focus on the Drell-Yan process and consider the vector-boson transverse

observables. The theoretical description depends on the hierarchy between the
hard, mass, and the $q_T$ (or $\mathcal T$) scales, ranging from the decoupling

evolution calculations must employ parametric algorithms for mass loss, and

loss algorithms for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial
mass range of $15-35\,M_\odot$. We consider combinations drawn from two hot
phase algorithms, three cool phase algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet algorithms.
We consider linear wind efficiency scale factors of $1$, $0.33$, and $0.1$ to
account for reductions in mass loss rates due to wind inhomogeneities. We find
that the initial to final mass mapping for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS)
mass has a $\sim 50\%$ uncertainty if all algorithm combinations and wind
efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale factor dominates this
uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal structure of our models
vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final observable parameters are
much less sensitive for ZAMS mass $\lesssim 30\,M_\odot$. This indicates that
uncertainty in wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS
mass of most single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations.
Furthermore, we show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is
sensitive to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss.
We find that the compactness parameter $\xi\propto M/R(M)$ varies by as much as
$30\%$ for a given ZAMS mass evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass
loss algorithm combinations. [abridged]

chemical gradients and possibly foster grain growth. The aim of this paper is
to understand how disc midplane temperature changes with gas and dust
evolution, and identify trends that may influence planet formation or allow to
constrain disc evolution observationally. We calculate disc temperature,
hydrostatic equilibrium and dust settling in a mutually consistent way from a
grid of disc models at different stages of gas loss, grain growth and hole
opening. We find that the CO snowline location depends very strongly on disc
properties. The CO snowline location migrates closer to the star for increasing
degrees of gas dispersal and dust growth. Around a typical A type star, the
snowline can be anywhere between several tens and a few hundred au, depending
on the disc properties such as gas mass and grain size. In fact, gas loss is as
efficient as dust evolution in settling discs, and flat discs may be gas-poor
counterparts of flared discs. Our results, in the context of different pre-main
sequence evolution of the luminosity in low- and intermediate-mass stars
suggests very different thermal (and hence chemical) histories in these two

good agreement with observations of Milky Way clouds. The driving parameter (b)
for the turbulence within each cloud is characterised by the ratio of the
density contrast (sigma_rho) to the average Mach number (Mach) within the
cloud, b = sigma_rho/Mach. As shown in previous works, b ~ 1/3 indicates
solenoidal (divergence-free) driving and b ~ 1 indicates compressive
(curl-free) driving. We find that the average b value of all the clouds formed
in the simulations has a lower limit of b > 0.2. Importantly, we find that b
has a broad distribution, covering values from purely solenoidal to purely
compressive driving. Tracking the evolution of individual clouds reveals that
the b value for each cloud does not vary significantly over their lifetime.
Finally, we perform a resolution study with minimum cell sizes of 8, 4, 2 and 1
pc and find that the average b value increases with increasing resolution.
Therefore, we conclude that our measured b values are strictly lower limits and
that a resolution better than 1 pc is required for convergence. However,

cases, which means that the effective driving mode alters significantly from

the number of data points, their application has been limited to small

modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly
with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to
simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are
examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic
oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits
structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture
of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or
uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a
mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a
physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also
demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We
present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing
scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a
range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond.

hot Jupiters can be well explained with a single truncated power law
distribution with a lower cutoff near 2$a_{Roche}$, a result that still holds
after a decade, and $\gamma=-0.51\pm^{0.19}_{0.20}$. However, the HAT and WASP
data show evidence for multiple populations (Bayes factor $\approx 10^{21}$).
We find that $15\pm^{9}_{6}\%$ reside in a component consistent with disk
migration ($\gamma=-0.04\pm^{0.53}_{1.27}$) and $85\pm^{6}_{9}\%$ in one
consistent with high-eccentricity migration ($\gamma=-1.38\pm^{0.32}_{0.47}$).
We find no immediately strong connections with some observed host star
properties and speculate on how future exoplanet surveys could improve upon hot
Jupiter population inference.

develop an algorithm that accurately extracts the location of the first

splashback radius of a halo as the smoothed average of the apocenter radii of
individual particles. This definition allows us to reliably measure the
splashback radii of 95% of host halos above a resolution limit of 1000

these radio data with optical, near-infrared (UltraVISTA), mid-infrared
(Spitzer/IRAC) data, and X-ray data (Chandra), we find counterparts to radio
sources for ~93% of the radio sample (in the areas of the COSMOS field not
affected by saturated or bright sources in the optical to NIR bands), reaching
out to z<6. We further classify the sources as star forming galaxies or AGN
based on various criteria, such as X-ray luminosity, observed MIR color, UV-FIR
spectral-energy distribution, rest-frame NUV-optical color corrected for dust
extinction, and radio-excess relative to that expected from the hosts'
star-formation rate. We separate the AGN into sub-samples dominated by
low-to-moderate and moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN, candidates for
high-redshift analogues to local low- and high-excitation emission line AGN,
respectively. We study the fractional contributions of these sub-populations
down to radio flux levels of ~11uJy at 3GHz (or ~20uJy at 1.4GHz assuming a
spectral index of -0.7). We find that the dominant fraction at 1.4GHz flux
densities above ~200uJy is constituted of low-to-moderate radiative luminosity
AGN. Below densities of ~100uJy the fraction of star-forming galaxies increases
to ~60%, followed by the moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN (~20%), and
low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN (~20%). Based on this observational
evidence, we extrapolate the fractions down to sensitivities of the SKA. Our
estimates suggest that at the faint flux limits to be reached by the SKA1
surveys, a selection based only on radio flux limits can provide a simple tool
to efficiently identify samples highly (>75%) dominated by star-forming
galaxies.

selected with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 3 GHz (10 cm) within the VLA-COSMOS
3 GHz Large Project, and cross-matched with multiwavelength ancillary data.
This is the largest sample of high-redshift (z$\lesssim$6) radio sources with
exquisite photometric coverage and redshift measurements available. We
constructed a sample of moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN (HLAGN) via
spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition combined with standard X-ray
and mid-infrared diagnostics. Within the remainder of the sample we further
identified low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN (MLAGN) via excess in radio
emission relative to the star formation rates in their host galaxies. We show
that AGN power in HLAGN occurs predominantly in radiative form, while MLAGN
display a substantial mechanical AGN luminosity component. We found significant
differences in the host properties of the two AGN classes, as a function of
redshift. At z$<$1.5, MLAGN appear to reside in significantly more massive and
less star-forming galaxies compared to HLAGN. At z$>$1.5, we observed a
reversal in the behaviour of the stellar mass distributions with the HLAGN
populating the higher stellar mass tail. We interpret this finding as a
possible hint of the downsizing of galaxies hosting HLAGN, with the most
massive galaxies triggering AGN activity earlier than less massive galaxies,
and then fading to MLAGN at lower redshifts. Our conclusion is that HLAGN and
MLAGN samples trace two distinct galaxy and AGN populations in a wide range of
redshifts, possibly resembling the radio AGN types often referred to as
radiative- and jet-mode (or high- and low-excitation), respectively.

uncertainties affecting the predictions for the number of EMRIs detectable by
LISA, and find that competing astrophysical assumptions produce a variance of

where emission is believed to arise solely from star-formation, and those where
an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is thought to be present. We account for
non-detections in the radio or in the infrared using a doubly-censored survival
analysis. We find that the IRRC of star-forming galaxies, quantified by the
infrared-to-1.4GHz radio luminosity ratio ($q_{\rm TIR}$), decreases with
increasing redshift: $q_{\rm TIR}(z)=(2.88\pm0.03)(1+z)^{-0.19\pm0.01}$.
Moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN do not follow the same $q_{\rm
TIR}$$(z)$ trend, having a lower normalisation and steeper decrease with
redshift. We cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified AGN
contributions only to the radio regime may be steepening the observed $q_{\rm
TIR}(z)$ trend of the star-forming population. An increasing fractional
contribution to the observed 3GHz flux by free-free emission of star-forming
galaxies may also affect the derived evolution. However, we find that the
standard (M82-based) assumption of the typical radio spectral energy
distribution (SED) for star-forming galaxies is inconsistent with our results.
This suggests a more complex shape of the typical radio SED for star-forming
galaxies, and that imperfect $K$ corrections in the radio may govern the
derived redshift trend of $q_{\rm TIR}$. Lastly, we present a
redshift-dependent relation between rest-frame 1.4GHz radio luminosity and star
formation rate taking the derived redshift trend into account.

on ultraviolet (UV) rest-frame observations of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at
high redshifts (z>4) on the order of 15-20%, owing to appreciable star
formation in highly dust-obscured galaxies, which might remain undetected in

different viewpoints is often error prone, as an object's appearance can vary
greatly between images. For such cases, it has been shown that using motion
extracted from video can achieve much better results than using a static image.
This paper extends these earlier works based on the scene dynamics. In this
paper we propose a new method to compute the epipolar geometry from a video
stream, by exploiting the following observation: For a pixel p in Image A, all
pixels corresponding to p in Image B are on the same epipolar line.
Equivalently, the image of the line going through camera A's center and p is an
epipolar line in B. Therefore, when cameras A and B are synchronized, the
momentary images of two objects projecting to the same pixel, p, in camera A at
times t1 and t2, lie on an epipolar line in camera B. Based on this observation
we achieve fast and precise computation of epipolar lines. Calibrating cameras
based on our method of finding epipolar lines is much faster and more robust
than previous methods.

(S_i)_{i\in [1,k]}$ of $V(G)$ into $k$ stable sets $S_1,\ldots, S_{k}$. Given a
weight function $w: V(G) \to \mathbb{R}^+$, the weight of a color $S_i$ is
defined as $w(i) = \max_{v \in S_i} w(v)$ and the weight of a coloring $c$ as
$w(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}w(i)$. Guan and Zhu [Inf. Process. Lett., 1997] defined
the weighted chromatic number of a pair $(G,w)$, denoted by $\sigma(G,w)$, as
the minimum weight of a proper coloring of $G$. For a positive integer $r$,
they also defined $\sigma(G,w;r)$ as the minimum of $w(c)$ among all proper
$r$-colorings $c$ of $G$.
  The complexity of determining $\sigma(G,w)$ when $G$ is a tree was open for
almost 20 years, until Ara\'ujo et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2014] recently
proved that the problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(\log n)}$ on $n$-vertex
trees unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.
  The objective of this article is to provide hardness results for computing
$\sigma(G,w)$ and $\sigma(G,w;r)$ when $G$ is a tree or a forest, relying on
complexity assumptions weaker than the ETH. Namely, we study the problem from
the viewpoint of parameterized complexity, and we assume the weaker hypothesis
$FPT \neq W[1]$. Building on the techniques of Ara\'ujo et al., we prove that
when $G$ is a forest, computing $\sigma(G,w)$ is $W[1]$-hard parameterized by
the size of a largest connected component of $G$, and that computing
$\sigma(G,w;r)$ is $W[2]$-hard parameterized by $r$. Our results rule out the
existence of $FPT$ algorithms for computing these invariants on trees or
forests for many natural choices of the parameter.

to compute the explicit vertical solutions for a given annulus. These solutions
satisfy energy and hydrostatic balance, as well as the radiative transfer
equation. In comparison to the 1D model, the 2D calculation predicts a less
extensive expansion of the atmosphere by orders of magnitude at the
parsec/sub-parsec scale, but the new scale-height $h$ may still exceed the
radial distance $R$ for various physical conditions. A total of 192 NSD models
are computed across the input parameter space in order to predict distributions
of a line of sight column density $N_H$. Assuming a random distribution of
input parameters, the statistics yield 56% of Type 1, 23% of Compton-thin Type

planetary rings, one of the least understood processes related to planet

their great diversity of mass, structure and composition is a challenge for any
formation scenario. Recent advances in our understanding of ring and satellite
formation and destruction suggest that these processes are interconnected, so
that rings and satellites may be two aspects of the same geological system.
However, no single theory seems able to explain the origin of the different
planetary rings known in our Solar System, and it now seems evident that rings
may result from a variety of processes like giant collisions, tidal stripping
of comets or satellites, as well as planet formation itself.
  In order to build any theory of ring formation it is important to specify
physical processes that affect the long-term evolution of rings, as well as to
describe the different observations that any ring formation model should
explain. This is the topic of section 2. In section 3, we focus our attention
on Saturn's rings and their main properties, and then discuss the pros and cons
of a series of ring formation models. We also discuss the link between rings
and satellites. In section 4, we extend the discussion to the other giant
planets (Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune). Section 5 is devoted to new types of
rings -- the recent discovery of rings orbiting small outer Solar System bodies
(Centaurs), and the possible rings around extrasolar planets. In section 6, we
conclude and try to identify critical observations and theoretical advances
needed to better understand the origin of rings and their significance in the
global evolution of planets.

algorithm iteratively solves the coordinate transform between the Lagrangian
and Eulerian frames without requiring any specific knowledge of the dynamics.
For dark matter field, it produces the non-linear displacement potential with
very high fidelity. The reconstruction error at the pixel level is within a few
percent, and is caused only by the emergence of the transverse component after
the shell-crossing. As it circumvents the strongest non-linearity of the
density evolution, the reconstructed field is well-described by linear theory
and immune from the bulk-flow smearing of the BAO signature. Therefore this
algorithm could significantly improve the measurement accuracy of the sound
horizon scale. For a perfect large-scale structure survey at redshift zero
without Poisson or instrumental noise, the fractional error is reduced by a
factor of 2.7, very close to the ideal limit with linear power spectrum and
Gaussian covariance matrix.

successes in a large variety of computer vision tasks. However, the high
computation intensity of DNNs makes it challenging to deploy these models on
resource-limited systems. Some studies used low-rank approaches that
approximate the filters by low-rank basis to accelerate the testing. Those
works directly decomposed the pre-trained DNNs by Low-Rank Approximations
(LRA). How to train DNNs toward lower-rank space for more efficient DNNs,
however, remains as an open area. To solve the issue, in this work, we propose
Force Regularization, which uses attractive forces to enforce filters so as to
coordinate more weight information into lower-rank space. We mathematically and
empirically verify that after applying our technique, standard LRA methods can
reconstruct filters using much lower basis and thus result in faster DNNs. The
effectiveness of our approach is comprehensively evaluated in ResNets, AlexNet,
and GoogLeNet. In AlexNet, for example, Force Regularization gains 2x speedup
on modern GPU without accuracy loss and 4.05x speedup on CPU by paying small
accuracy degradation. Moreover, Force Regularization better initializes the
low-rank DNNs such that the fine-tuning can converge faster toward higher
accuracy. The obtained lower-rank DNNs can be further sparsified, proving that
Force Regularization can be integrated with state-of-the-art sparsity-based

critical tasks for network administrators today. It has an important role for
organizations, governments and our society due to its valuable resources on
computer networks. Traditional misuse detection strategies are unable to detect
new and unknown intrusion. Besides, anomaly detection in network security is
aim to distinguish between illegal or malicious events and normal behavior of
network systems. Anomaly detection can be considered as a classification
problem where it builds models of normal network behavior, which it uses to
detect new patterns that significantly deviate from the model. Most of the cur-
rent research on anomaly detection is based on the learning of normally and
anomaly behaviors. They do not take into account the previous, re- cent events
to detect the new incoming one. In this paper, we propose a real time
collective anomaly detection model based on neural network learning and feature
operating. Normally a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM
RNN) is trained only on normal data and it is capable of predicting several
time steps ahead of an input. In our approach, a LSTM RNN is trained with
normal time series data before performing a live prediction for each time step.
Instead of considering each time step separately, the observation of prediction
errors from a certain number of time steps is now proposed as a new idea for
detecting collective anomalies. The prediction errors from a number of the
latest time steps above a threshold will indicate a collective anomaly. The
model is built on a time series version of the KDD 1999 dataset. The
experiments demonstrate that it is possible to offer reliable and efficient for
collective anomaly detection.

where the physical evolution of the state of a qubit or group of qubits during

stems from a combination of control errors and random single qubit errors from
interaction with the environment. While great strides have been made in
mitigating control errors, intrinsic qubit error remains a serious problem that
sets the primary limit for gate fidelity in modern superconducting qubit
architectures. Simultaneously, recent developments of small error-corrected
logical qubit devices promise significant increases in logical state lifetime,
but translating those improvements into increases in gate fidelity is a complex
challenge. In this Letter, we propose a new formalism for implementing gates on
and between small logical qubit devices which inherit the parent device's
tolerance to single qubit errors which occur at any time before or during the
gate. Using a standard phenomenological noise model for superconducting qubits,
we demonstrate a universal one- and two-qubit gate set with error rates an
order of magnitude lower than those for equivalent operations on single qubits
or pairs of qubits, running for the same total duration. The effective logical
gate error rate in these models displays superlinear error reduction with
linear increases in single qubit lifetime, proving that passive error
correction is capable of increasing gate fidelity. These developments further
suggest that incorporating small logical qubits into a measurement based code

graph, network communication between players is considered to be limited. A
generalized communication graph is designed so that players exchange only their
required information. An algorithm is designed whereby players, with possibly
partially-coupled cost functions, make decisions based on the estimates of
other players' actions obtained from local neighbors. It is shown that this
choice of communication graph guarantees that all players' information is

graphs, almost sure convergence to a Nash equilibrium is proved for diminishing
step sizes. Moreover, the case when the cost functions are not known by the
players is investigated and a convergence proof is presented for diminishing
step sizes. The effect of the second largest eigenvalue of the expected
communication matrix on the convergence rate is quantified. The trade-off

integral field spectroscopy data obtained from 734 galaxies observed by the
CALIFA survey. These unparalleled spatially resolved spectroscopic data allow
us to determine the metallicity at the same physical scale ($\mathrm{R_{e}}$)
for different calibrators. We obtain MZ relations with similar shapes for all
calibrators, once the scale factors among them are taken into account. We do
not find any significant secondary relation of the MZR with either the star
formation rate (SFR) or the specific SFR for any of the calibrators used in
this study, based on the analysis of the residuals of the best fitted relation.
However we do see a hint for a (s)SFR-dependent deviation of the MZ-relation at
low masses (M$<$10$^{9.5}$M$_\odot$), where our sample is not complete. We are
thus unable to confirm the results by Mannucci et al. (2010), although we
cannot exclude that this result is due to the differences in the analysed
datasets. In contrast, our results are inconsistent with the results by
Lara-Lopez et al. (2010), and we can exclude the presence of a SFR-Mass-Oxygen
abundance Fundamental Plane. These results agree with previous findings
suggesting that either (1) the secondary relation with the SFR could be induced
by an aperture effect in single fiber/aperture spectroscopic surveys, (2) it
could be related to a local effect confined to the central regions of galaxies,
or (3) it is just restricted to the low-mass regime, or a combination of the
three effects.

notes in an audio recording, through three attributes: onset time, duration and
pitch. Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA) has become very popular
for this task. PLCA is a spectrogram factorization method, able to model a
magnitude spectrogram as a linear combination of spectral vectors from a
dictionary. Such methods use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to
estimate the parameters of the acoustic model. This algorithm presents
well-known inherent defaults (local convergence, initialization dependency),
making EM-based systems limited in their applications to AMT, particularly in
regards to the mathematical form and number of priors. To overcome such limits,
we propose in this paper to employ a different estimation framework based on
Particle Filtering (PF), which consists in sampling the posterior distribution
over larger parameter ranges. This framework proves to be more robust in
parameter estimation, more flexible and unifying in the integration of prior
knowledge in the system. Note-level transcription accuracies of 61.8 $\%$ and
59.5 $\%$ were achieved on evaluation sound datasets of two different
instrument repertoires, including the classical piano (from MAPS dataset) and
the marovany zither, and direct comparisons to previous PLCA-based approaches

reached thermal equilibrium, such dark matter is apparently either too abundant

condensate is generated during an early era of cosmological history and its
late decay dilutes dark matter. We show that such dilution allows previously
thermalized gravitinos to account for the observed dark matter over very wide
ranges of gravitino mass, keV < $m_{3/2}$ < TeV, axion decay constant, $10^9$

from axion production from both misalignment and parametric resonance

events with displaced vertices and kinks, and may contain saxions decaying to

functions fulfilling the same requirements at the pole. We exemplify the case
for the $K^*(892)$ vector meson, where the mass function deviates around 2 MeV
from the $K\pi$ threshold to the pole position. The absorptive correction
depends on the mass of the particles in the loop. For vector mesons, whose main
decay is into two pseudoscalar mesons ($PP'$), the flavor symmetry breaking
induces a correction to the longitudinal part of the propagator. Considering

obtaining the modified vector and scalar form factors. The $K_S\pi^-$ spectrum

start-up companies and technology giants have jumped into the space.
Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoT, come at the
expense of privacy and security. Industry reports and academic work have
revealed many attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property
loss and large-scale availability problems. To mitigate such threats, a few
solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the
impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a
comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming
to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move
forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive
amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related
articles. Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning
technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from
industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them,
the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further
attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT
ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this
taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we
define. Our assessment reveals that relevant security and privacy problems are
far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a
problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We
stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend
of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also
identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT
ecosystem.

trajectories in the de Broglie - Bohm picture of quantum mechanics, in systems
of two and three degrees of freedom. In the 2D case, chaos is generated via
multiple scatterings of the trajectories with one or more `nodal point -
X-point complexes'. In the 3D case, these complexes form foliations along
`nodal lines' accompanied by `X-lines'. We also identify cases of integrable or
partially integrable quantum trajectories. The role of chaos is important in
interpreting the dynamical origin of the `quantum relaxation' effect, i.e. the
dynamical emergence of Born's rule for the quantum probabilities, which has
been proposed as an extension of the Bohmian picture of quantum mechanics. In
particular, the local scaling laws characterizing the chaotic scattering
phenomena near X-points, or X-lines, are related to the global rate at which
the quantum relaxation is observed to proceed. Also, the degree of chaos
determines the rate at which nearly-coherent initial wavepacket states lose
their spatial coherence in the course of time.

leads to pronounced peak in the scattering rate and we demonstrate that this

unequivocally demonstrate that interaction of electrons with resonant mode in

self energy signatures of the electron-boson coupling in cuprates and resolve
long standing controversy surrounding this issue. The momentum dependence of
the strength of electron-mode interaction enables development of quantitative

(or penalization) is used to control model complexity and induce desired
structure. Each penalty has a weight parameter that indicates how strongly the
structure corresponding to that penalty should be enforced. Typically the
parameters are chosen to minimize the error on a separate validation set using
a simple grid search or a gradient-free optimization method. It is more
efficient to tune parameters if the gradient can be determined, but this is
often difficult for problems with non-smooth penalty functions. Here we show
that for many penalized regression problems, the validation loss is actually
smooth almost-everywhere with respect to the penalty parameters. We can
therefore apply a modified gradient descent algorithm to tune parameters.
Through simulation studies on example regression problems, we find that
increasing the number of penalty parameters and tuning them using our method
can decrease the generalization error.

previous detections of a low-frequency hard lag found in XMM-Newton data. The
NuSTAR spectrum is well described by a low-temperature Comptonisation continuum

one or more pronunciations for each word. In this paper, we focus on learning a
similarity function between two pronunciations. The pronunciations can be the
canonical and the surface pronunciations of the same word or they can be two
surface pronunciations of different words. This task generalizes problems such
as lexical access (the problem of learning the mapping between words and their

to dynamically increase the size of the pronunciation lexicon, or in predicting
ASR errors. We propose two methods, which are based on recurrent neural
networks, to learn the similarity function. The first is based on binary
classification, and the second is based on learning the ranking of the
pronunciations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on the task of
lexical access using a subset of the Switchboard conversational speech corpus.

the most striking is the scaling of the overall abundance of proteins, or
protein domains, sharing a specific functional annotation across genomes of
given size. The size of these functional categories change, on average, as
power-laws in the total number of protein-coding genes. Here, we show that such
regularities are not restricted to the overall behavior of high-level
functional categories, but also exist systematically at the level of single
evolutionary families of protein domains. Specifically, the number of proteins
within each family follows family-specific scaling laws with genome size.
Functionally similar sets of families tend to follow similar scaling laws, but
this is not always the case. To understand this systematically, we provide a
comprehensive classification of families based on their scaling properties.
Additionally, we develop a quantitative score for the heterogeneity of the
scaling of families belonging to a given category or predefined group. Under
the common reasonable assumption that selection is driven solely or mainly by
biological function, these findings point to fine-tuned and interdependent
functional roles of specific protein domains, beyond our current functional
annotations. This analysis provides a deeper view on the links between
evolutionary expansion of protein families and the functional constraints

into different categories such as deterministic vs. probabilistic, comparative
methods vs. generative methods, and so on. In some of the more popular
comparative methods, researchers compare observed epidemiological data from
early stages of an outbreak with the output of proposed models to forecast the
future trend and prevalence of the pandemic. A significant problem in this area
is the lack of standard well-defined evaluation measures to select the best
algorithm among different ones, as well as for selecting the best possible
configuration for a particular algorithm.
  Results: In this paper, we present an evaluation framework which allows for
combining different features, error measures, and ranking schema to evaluate
forecasts. We describe the various epidemic features (Epi-features) included to
characterize the output of forecasting methods and provide suitable error
measures that could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods with
respect to these Epi-features. We focus on long-term predictions rather than
short-term forecasting and demonstrate the utility of the framework by
evaluating six forecasting methods for predicting influenza in the United
States. Our results demonstrate that different error measures lead to different
rankings even for a single Epi-feature. Further, our experimental analyses show
that no single method dominates the rest in predicting all Epi-features, when
evaluated across error measures. As an alternative, we provide various
consensus ranking schema that summarizes individual rankings, thus accounting
for different error measures. We believe that a comprehensive evaluation
framework, as presented in this paper, will add value to the computational
epidemiology community.

We also aim
to provide equations to estimate accurate dust properties from limited
observational datasets.
  We assemble a sample of 1,630 nearby (z<0.1) galaxies-over a large range of
Mstar, SFR - with multi-wavelength observations available from wise, iras,
planck and/or SCUBA. The characterization of dust emission comes from SED
fitting using Draine & Li dust models, which we parametrize using two
components (warm and cold ). The subsample of these galaxies with global
measurements of CO and/or HI are used to explore the molecular and/or atomic
gas content of the galaxies.
  The total Lir, Mdust and dust temperature of the cold component (Tc) form a
plane that we refer to as the dust plane. A galaxy's sSFR drives its position
on the dust plane: starburst galaxies show higher Lir, Mdust and Tc compared to
Main Sequence and passive galaxies. Starburst galaxies also show higher
specific Mdust (Mdust/Mstar) and specific Mgas (Mgas/Mstar). The Mdust is more
closely correlated with the total Mgas (atomic plus molecular) than with the
individual components. Our multi wavelength data allows us to define several
equations to estimate Lir, Mdust and Tc from one or two monochromatic
luminosities in the infrared and/or sub-millimeter.
  We estimate the dust mass and infrared luminosity from a single monochromatic
luminosity within the R-J tail of the dust emission, with errors of 0.12 and
0.20dex, respectively. These errors are reduced to 0.05 and 0.10 dex,
respectively, if the Tc is used. The Mdust is correlated with the total Mism
(Mism \propto Mdust^0.7). For galaxies with Mstar 8.5<log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.9,
the conversion factor \alpha_850mum shows a large scatter (rms=0.29dex). The SF
mode of a galaxy shows a correlation with both the Mgass and Mdust: high
Mdust/Mstar galaxies are gas-rich and show the highest SFRs.

waves can interact with each other, changing their phases, wavelengths, shapes,

from the multimode nature of the interacting electromagnetic fields, such as

interaction of light waves without them physically overlapping, thus providing
a viable solution for those challenges, as indicated in recent bulk-optics

tend to focus on avoiding saddle points and local minima. However, the
practical observation is that, at least in the case of the most successful Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), practitioners can always increase the
network size to fit the training data (an extreme example would be [1]). The
most successful DCNNs such as VGG and ResNets are best used with a degree of
""overparametrization"". In this work, we characterize with a mix of theory and
experiments, the landscape of the empirical risk of overparametrized DCNNs. We
first prove in the regression framework the existence of a large number of
degenerate global minimizers with zero empirical error (modulo inconsistent
equations). The argument that relies on the use of Bezout theorem is rigorous
when the RELUs are replaced by a polynomial nonlinearity (which empirically
works as well). As described in our Theory III [2] paper, the same minimizers
are degenerate and thus very likely to be found by SGD that will furthermore
select with higher probability the most robust zero-minimizer. We further
experimentally explored and visualized the landscape of empirical risk of a
DCNN on CIFAR-10 during the entire training process and especially the global
minima. Finally, based on our theoretical and experimental results, we propose
an intuitive model of the landscape of DCNN's empirical loss surface, which
might not be as complicated as people commonly believe.

at discovering massive dense cores (MDCs) able to host the high-mass analogs of
low-mass prestellar cores, which have been searched for over the past decade.
We here focus on NGC6334, one of the best-studied HOBYS molecular cloud
complexes.
  We used Herschel PACS and SPIRE 70-500mu images of the NGC6334 complex
complemented with (sub)millimeter and mid-infrared data. We built a complete
procedure to extract ~0.1 pc dense cores with the getsources software, which
simultaneously measures their far-infrared to millimeter fluxes. We carefully
estimated the temperatures and masses of these dense cores from their SEDs.
  A cross-correlation with high-mass star formation signposts suggests a mass
threshold of 75Msun for MDCs in NGC6334. MDCs have temperatures of 9.5-40K,
masses of 75-1000Msun, and densities of 10^5-10^8cm-3. Their mid-IR emission is
used to separate 6 IR-bright and 10 IR-quiet protostellar MDCs while their 70mu
emission strength, with respect to fitted SEDs, helps identify 16 starless MDC
candidates. The ability of the latter to host high-mass prestellar cores is
investigated here and remains questionable. An increase in mass and density
from the starless to the IR-quiet and IR-bright phases suggests that the
protostars and MDCs simultaneously grow in mass. The statistical lifetimes of
the high-mass prestellar and protostellar core phases, estimated to be
1-7x10^4yr and at most 3x10^5yr respectively, suggest a dynamical scenario of
high-mass star formation.
  The present study provides good mass estimates for a statistically
significant sample, covering the earliest phases of high-mass star formation.
High-mass prestellar cores may not exist in NGC6334, favoring a scenario
presented here, which simultaneously forms clouds and high-mass protostars.

eroded by their surrounding fluid, which would result in a significantly
increased concentration of heavy elements in the hydrogen-helium envelope.
Furthermore, the heavy elements could inhibit convection by creating a
stabilizing gradient of composition. In order to explore the effects of core
erosion, we performed ab initio simulations to study structural, diffusion and
viscosity properties of dense multi-component mixtures of hydrogen, helium, and
silicon dioxide at relevant pressure-temperature conditions. We computed radial
distribution functions to identify changes in the chemical behavior of the

erosion and the mixing of its constituents into the envelope, which will help

at the transition temperature from their self-field critical currents. Our
central finding is that the enhancement in transition temperature for these

retaining a largely unchanged bulk superconducting gap. Literature data reveals
that ultrathin niobium films similarly develop a second superconducting gap.
Based on the available data, it seems that, for type-II superconductors, a new

in strong gravitational fields. The current observations on the
gravitational-wave (GW) bursts by LIGO have already placed various constraints
on the alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate the
possible bounds which could be placed on the Brans-Dicke gravity using GW
detection from inspiralling compact binaries with the proposed Einstein
Telescope, a third-generation GW detector. We first calculate in details the
waveforms of gravitational radiation in the lowest post-Newtonian
approximation, including the tensor and scalar fields, which can be divided
into the three polarization modes, i.e. ""plus mode"", ""cross mode"" and
""breathing mode"". Applying the stationary phase approximation, we obtain their
Fourier transforms, and derive the correction terms in amplitude, phase and
polarization of GWs, relative to the corresponding results in General
Relativity. Imposing the noise level of Einstein Telescope, we find that the GW
detection from inspiralling compact binaries, composed of a neutron star and a
black hole, can place stringent constraints on the Brans-Dicke gravity. The
bound on the coupling constant $\omega_{\rm BD}$ depends on the mass,
sky-position, orbital angle, polarization angle, luminosity distance, redshift
distribution and total observed number $N_{\rm GW}$ of the binary systems.
Taking into account all the burst events up to redshift $z=5$, we find that the
bound could be $\omega_{\rm BD}\gtrsim 10^{6}\times(N_{\rm GW}/10^4)^{1/2}$.
Even for the conservative estimation with $10^{4}$ observed events, the bound
is still more than one order tighter than the current limit from Solar System
experiments. So, we conclude that Einstein Telescope will provide a powerful
platform to test alternative theories of gravity.

our understanding of gravitational wave sources such as GW 150914, as well as
the incidence of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Two scenarios have been
suggested for both phenomena: one of them involves rapid rotation and
quasi-chemical homogeneous evolution (CHE), the other invokes classical
evolution through mass loss in single and binary systems. WR spin rates might
enable us to test these two scenarios. In order to obtain empirical constraints
on black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR
stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a
significantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).
This brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to
the Galactic sample. We measure WR wind asymmetries with VLT-FORS linear
spectropolarimetry. We report the detection of new line effects in the LMC WN
star BAT99-43 and the WC star BAT99-70, as well as the famous WR/LBV HD 5980 in
the SMC, which might be evolving chemically homogeneously. With the previous
reported line effects in the late-type WNL (Ofpe/WN9) objects BAT99-22 and
BAT99-33, this brings the total LMC WR sample to 4, i.e. a frequency of ~10%.
Perhaps surprisingly, the incidence of line effects amongst low-Z WR stars is
not found to be any higher than amongst the Galactic WR sample, challenging the
rotationally-induced CHE model. As WR mass loss is likely Z-dependent, our
Magellanic Cloud line-effect WR stars may maintain their surface rotation and
fulfill the basic conditions for producing long GRBs, both via the classical
post-red supergiant (RSG) or luminous blue variable (LBV) channel, as well as
resulting from CHE due to physics specific to very massive stars (VMS).

the antisymmetric resonant modes of the thin film, resulting from surface
phonon-polariton coupling, on- and off-resonance with the resonant mode of the
bulk as a function of the temperature bias direction. Rectification efficiency
is investigated by varying structural parameters, namely the vacuum gap size,
the dielectric function of the substrate onto which the film is coated, and the
film thickness to gap size ratio. Calculations based on fluctuational

and focuses on improving solvers by offline training. Specifically, the key
issues of offline training methods are discussed, and research belonging to
this category but from different areas are reviewed in a unified framework.
Existing training methods generally adopt a two-stage strategy in which
selecting the training instances and training instances are treated in two
independent phases. This paper proposes a new training method, dubbed LiangYi,
which addresses these two issues simultaneously. LiangYi includes a training
module for a population-based solver and an instance sampling module for
updating the training instances. The idea behind LiangYi is to promote the
population-based solver by training it (with the training module) to improve
its performance on those instances (discovered by the sampling module) on which
it performs badly, while keeping the good performances obtained by it on
previous instances. An instantiation of LiangYi on the Travelling Salesman
Problem is also proposed. Empirical results on a huge testing set containing
10000 instances showed LiangYi could train solvers that perform significantly

stored in the corona, but the build up of coronal energy alone may be
insufficient for the imminent flare occurrence. The flare onset mechanism is a
critical but less understood problem, insights into which could be gained from
small-scale energy releases known as precursors, which are observed as small
pre-flare brightenings in various wavelengths, and also from certain
small-scale magnetic configurations such as the opposite polarity fluxes, where
magnetic orientation of small bipoles is opposite to that of the ambient main
polarities. However, high-resolution observations of flare precursors together
with the associated photospheric magnetic field dynamics are lacking. Here we
study precursors of a flare using unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of
the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope, complemented by novel microwave data. Two
episodes of precursor brightenings are initiated at a small-scale magnetic
channel (a form of opposite polarity fluxes) with multiple polarity inversions
and enhanced magnetic fluxes and currents, lying near the footpoints of sheared
magnetic loops. The low-atmospheric origin of these precursor emissions is
corroborated by microwave spectra. We propose that the emerging magnetic
channel field interacts with the sheared arcades to cause precursor
brightenings at the main flare core region. These high-resolution results
provide evidence of low-atmospheric small-scale energy release and possible
relationship to the onset of the main flare.

consistent and accurate calibrations of the CIV-based SE BH mass estimators
against the H$\beta$ reverberation-based masses, using three different measures
of broad-line width: full-width at half maximum (FWHM), line dispersion
($\sigma_{\rm line}$) and mean absolute deviation (MAD). The newly expanded

L_{\rm bol}/$erg s$^{\rm -1}=41.7-46.9$), and we derive the new CIV-based mass
estimators using a Bayesian linear regression analysis over this range. We
generally recommend the use of $\sigma_{\rm line}$ or MAD rather than FWHM to
obtain a less biased velocity measurement of the CIV emission line, because its
narrow-line component contribution is difficult to decompose from the
broad-line profile.

unstable flux rope which showed counterclockwise rotation. The flux rope could
not reach the height of torus instability and failed to form a coronal mass

the best atmospheric seeing images (FWHM $\lesssim$0.8""), which constitute

made object catalogs to compare the optimal-resolution, yet shallower image to
the lower-resolution but deeper image. We show that the number counts for both

$U_{AB}$$\sim$ 27, the object counts from the optimal-resolution image start to
drop-off dramatically (90% between $U_{AB}$ = 27 and 28 mag), while the deepest
image with better surface-brightness sensitivity ($\mu^{AB}_{U}$$\lesssim$ 32
mag arcsec$^{-2}$) show a more gradual drop (10% between $U_{AB}$ $\simeq$ 27

clumpy features within the galaxies are more prominent in the
optimal-resolution image compared to the deeper mosaics. Finally, we find - for
220 brighter galaxies with $U_{AB}$$\lesssim$ 24 mag - only marginal
differences in total flux between the optimal-resolution and lower-resolution
light-profiles to $\mu^{AB}_{U}$$\lesssim$ 32 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. In only 10% of

reduced 192016 magnitude observations of 165 asteroids of the Themis family,
using data from the astrometric-photometric database of the Minor Planet
Center, MPCOBS, and measuring the absolute magnitudes from the phase plots. 25
objects of 165 (15.2%), exhibited bumps or enhancements in brightness that
might indicate low level cometary activity. Since activity repeats at the same
place in different orbits and in many occasions is centered at perihelion,
activity might be due to water ice sublimation. As of September 2016, there are
717768 asteroids listed in the MPC files. If we assume that we do not have any
false positives and the above percentage can be extrapolated to the whole Main
Belt, the number of potentially active asteroid gets to the very large number
of ~111.000. This number is much larger than the ones predicted in previous
surveys and indicates one of three scenarios: A) there are many false positives
in our detections and the real number of active asteroid is much smaller than
we found, implying that the MPC astrometric-photometric database is only
astrometric and not photometric. B) The location of active asteroids is
restricted to the Themis family and an extrapolation to the whole belt is not
possible. Or C) there are few false positives in our candidates and the main
belt actually contains many low level active asteroids undetected by current
surveys. Case C) would imply that the main belt is not a field of bare rocks
but a graveyard of extinct comets, changing our current paradigm of the main
belt. So it is of the outmost importance to verify observationally our

employed to enhance the interaction time between light and matter. Here, we
propose to utilize the effect of coherent population trapping (CPT) to directly
generate squeezed light without any optical cavity. Combined with the slow
propagation speed of light in a CPT medium, a coherent state passing through an
atomic ensemble with a high optical density (OD) can evolve into a highly
squeezed state even in a single passage. Our study reveals that noise squeezing
of more than $10$ dB can be achieved with an OD of 1,000, which is currently
available in experiments. A larger OD can further increase the degree of
squeezing. As the light intensity and two-photon detuning are key factors in
the CPT interaction, we also demonstrate that the minimum variance at a given
OD can be reached for a wide range of these two factors, showing the proposed
scheme is flexible and robust. Furthermore, there is no need to consider the
phase-matching condition in the CPT scheme. Our introduction of high OD in
atomic media not only brings a long light-matter interaction time comparable to
optical cavities, but also opens new avenue in the generation of squeezed light
for quantum interface.

(lasting >~ 1 sec) black holes may form in cases both of successful and failed
supernovalike explosions. A basic trend is that cores with a specific angular

comparing the results with the equivalent nucleon form factors. Drawing on a
recent extension of the graded-symmetry approach for the flavor-singlet

In a sense, the manifold generalizes the symmetry, which is also a solution to

discrete models of hyperbolic type. It is known that such kind equations have
two hierarchies of symmetries, corresponding to the characteristic directions.
We have shown that properly chosen generalized invariant manifold allows one to
construct recursion operators that generate these symmetries. It is surprising
that both recursion operators are related to different parametrizations of the

results for the pressure and structure factor of the system in a whole range of

to a very unacceptable result beyond that region. Namely, the Percus-Yevick
theory predicts a smooth behavior of the pressure that diverges only when the
volume fraction $\eta$ approaches unity. Thus, within the theory there seems to
be no indication for the termination of the liquid phase and the transition to
a solid or to a glass. In the present article we study the Percus-Yevick hard
sphere pair distribution function, $g_2(r)$, for various spatial dimensions. We
find that beyond a certain critical volume fraction $\eta_c$, the pair
distribution function, $g_2(r)$, which should be positive definite, becomes
negative at some distances. We also present an intriguing observation that the
critical $\eta_c$ values we find are consistent with volume fractions where
onsets of random close packing (or maximally random jammed states) are reported
in the literature for various dimensions. That observation is supported by an
intuitive argument. This work may have important implications for other systems

application areas, screening methods that rapidly identify a small subset of
promising predictors have become commonplace. We propose a new MOdular Bayes
Screening (MOBS) approach, which involves several novel characteristics that
can potentially lead to improved performance. MOBS first applies a Bayesian
mixture model to the marginal distribution of the response, obtaining posterior
samples of mixture weights, cluster-specific parameters, and cluster
allocations for each subject. Hypothesis tests are then introduced,
corresponding to whether or not to include a given predictor, with posterior
probabilities for each hypothesis available analytically conditionally on
unknowns sampled in the first stage and tuning parameters controlling borrowing
of information across tests. By marginalizing over the first stage posterior
samples, we avoid under-estimation of uncertainty typical of two-stage methods.
We greatly simplify the model specification and reduce computational complexity
by using {\em modularization}. We provide basic theoretical support for this
approach, and illustrate excellent performance relative to competitors in
simulation studies and the ability to capture complex shifts beyond simple
differences in means. The method is illustrated with applications to genomics
by using a very high-dimensional cis-eQTL dataset with roughly 38 million SNPs.

[4, 5], which in an asymptotic sense describes the evolution of the component
sizes of a wide array of near-critical coalescent processes, including the
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi process.
  We show tightness of the fixation time in the ""Brownian"" regime, explicitly
determining the median value of the fixation time to within an optimal $O(1)$
window. This generalizes {\L}uczak's result [31] for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graph using completely different techniques.
  In the heavy-tailed case, in which the limit of the component sizes can be
encoded using a thinned pure-jump L\'{e}vy process, we prove that only
one-sided tightness holds. This shows a genuine difference in the possible
behavior in the two regimes.
  The solution to the leader problem in the setting of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graph played an important role in the study of the scaling limit of the
minimal spanning tree on the complete graph [2]. We believe that analogous
results, such as those proved herein, will be useful in establishing
universality of the intrinsic geometry of the minimal spanning tree across a
large class of models.

first posed questions about the stability of Taylor-Couette flows of conducting
material under the influence of large-scale magnetic fields. These and many new
questions can now be answered numerically where the nonlinear simulations even
provide the instability-induced values of several transport coefficients. The
cylindrical containers are axially unbounded and penetrated by magnetic
background fields with axial and/or azimuthal components. The influence of the
magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$ on the onset of the instabilities is shown to be
substantial. The potential flow subject to axial fields becomes unstable
against axisymmetric perturbations for a certain supercritical value of the
averaged Reynolds number $\overline{Rm}=\sqrt{Re\cdot Rm}$ (with $Re$ the
Reynolds number of rotation, $Rm$ its magnetic Reynolds number). Rotation
profiles as flat as the quasi-Keplerian rotation law scale similarly but only
for $Pm\gg 1$ while for $Pm\ll 1$ the instability instead sets in for
supercritical $Rm$ at an optimal value of the magnetic field. Among the
considered instabilities of azimuthal fields, those of the Chandrasekhar-type,
where the background field and the background flow have identical radial
profiles, are particularly interesting. They are unstable against
nonaxisymmetric perturbations if at least one of the diffusivities is non-zero.
For $Pm\ll 1$ the onset of the instability scales with $Re$ while it scales
with $\overline{Rm}$ for $Pm\gg 1$. - Even superrotation can be destabilized by
azimuthal and current-free magnetic fields; this recently discovered
nonaxisymmetric instability is of a double-diffusive character, thus excluding
$Pm= 1$. It scales with $Re$ for $Pm\to 0$ and with $Rm$ for $Pm\to \infty$.

and learn human perceptions. Interestingly, the semantic context of images is
often ambiguous as images can be perceived with emphasis on different aspects,
which may be contradictory to each other.
  In this paper, we present a method for learning the semantic similarity among
images, inferring their latent aspects and embedding them into multi-spaces
corresponding to their semantic aspects.
  We consider the multi-embedding problem as an optimization function that
evaluates the embedded distances with respect to the qualitative clustering
queries. The key idea of our approach is to collect and embed qualitative
measures that share the same aspects in bundles. To ensure similarity aspect
sharing among multiple measures, image classification queries are presented to,
and solved by users. The collected image clusters are then converted into
bundles of tuples, which are fed into our bundle optimization algorithm that
jointly infers the aspect similarity and multi-aspect embedding. Extensive
experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-embedding approaches on various datasets, and scales
well for large multi-aspect similarity measures.

density structures at a distance of 2.5--15~R propagating with periodicity of

formed in the lower corona. We used the large Ukrainian radio telescope URAN-2
to observe type IV radio bursts in the frequency range of 8--32~MHz during the
time interval of 08:15--11:00~UT on August 1, 2011. Radio emission in this
frequency range originated at the distance of 1.5--2.5 R according to the
Baumbach-Allen density model of the solar corona. Morlet wavelet analysis
showed the periodicity of 80~min in radio emission intensity at all
frequencies, which demonstrates that there are quasi-periodic variations of
coronal density at all heights. The observed periodicity corresponds to the
acoustic cut-off frequency of stratified corona at a temperature of 1~MK. We
suggest that continuous perturbations of the coronal base in the form of
jets/explosive events generate acoustic pulses, which propagate upwards and
leave the wake behind oscillating at the coronal cut-off frequency. This wake
may transform into recurrent shocks due to the density decrease with height,
which leads to the observed periodicity in the radio emission. The recurrent
shocks may trigger quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection in helmet streamers,
where the opposite field lines merge and consequently may generate periodic
density structures observed in the solar wind.

Furthermore, they can store energy in their elastic element and can release it
later to achieve human-like dynamic movements. However, it is not clear how to
integrate them in teleoperator systems so that they can be controlled
intuitively by a human.
  We performed an experiment to study human use of elastic tools to determine
how a teleoperator system with an elastic slave would need to be designed. For
this, we had 13 untrained participants hammer with an elastic tool under
different stiffness conditions, asking them to try to find the best timing for
a backward-forward swing motion in order to achieve the strongest impact.
  We found that the participants generally executed the task efficiently after
a few trials and they converged to very similar solutions. The stiffness
influenced the performance slightly, a stiffness between 2.3 Nm/rad and 4.1
Nm/rad showing the best results.
  We conclude that humans intuitively know how to efficiently use elastic tools
for hammering type tasks. This could facilitate the control of teleoperator
systems with elastic slave manipulators for tasks requiring explosive movements
like hammering.

  through Power Talk in DC Microgrids","Submitted to a magazine",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The future smart grid is envisioned as a network of interconnected microgrids
(MGs) - small-scale local power networks comprising generators, storage
capacities and loads. MGs bring unprecedented modularity, efficiency,
sustainability, and resilience to the power grid as a whole. Due to the high
share of renewable generation, MGs require innovative concepts for control and
optimization, giving rise to a novel class of smart energy applications, in
which communications represent an integral part. In this paper, we review power
talk, a communication technique specifically developed for direct current MGs,
which exploits the communication potential residing within the MG power
equipment. Depending on the smart energy application, power talk can be used
either as a primary communication enabler, or an auxiliary communication system
that provides resilient and secure operation. The key advantage of power talk
is that it derives its availability, reliability, and security from the very MG
elements, outmatching standard, off-the shelf communication solutions.

consisted of a long single pulse sequence of 6678 pulses, and its fluctuation
spectral analysis revealed that the pulsar shows a time-varying amplitude
modulation, where for a thousand periods or so the spectra have a broad low
frequency ""red"" excess and then at intervals they suddenly exhibit highly
periodic longitude-stationary modulation of both the core and conal components
for several hundred periods. The fluctuations of the leading conal and the core
components are in phase, while those in the trailing conal component in
counterphase. These fluctuation properties are consistant with shorter pulse
sequence analyses reported in an earlier study by Weltevrede et al. (2006,
2007) as well as in our shorter pulse sequence data sets. We argue that this
dual modulation of core and conal emission cannot be understood by a model
where subpulse modulation is associated with the plasma {\bf E}$\times${\bf B}

emission-pattern change over timescales of $\sim$18 s (or 25 pulsar periods),

such that $H$ is $k$-geodesic, but not $(k+1)$-geodesic, so this defines a
strict hierarchy of properties. We are interested in situations in which this
hierarchy collapses in the sense that if $H \subseteq G$ is $k$-geodesic, then
$H$ is already fully geodesic in $G$.
  Our first result of this kind asserts that if $T$ is a tree and $T \subseteq
G$ is 2-geodesic with respect to some length-function $\ell$, then it is fully
geodesic. This fails for graphs containing a cycle. We also prove that if $C$
is a cycle and $C \subseteq G$ is 6-geodesic, then $C$ is fully geodesic. We
present an example showing that the number six is indeed optimal.
  We then develop a structural approach towards a more general theory and
present several open questions concerning the big picture underlying this
phenomenon.

rotational-vibrational state distribution from investigated spectra without
limiting presumptions, a state-by- state temperature-independent fitting
procedure is the ideal approach. In this paper we present a novel software tool
developed for this purpose, freely available for scientific community. The
introduced tool offers a convenient way to construct Boltzmann plots even from
partially overlapping spectra, in user-friendly environment. We apply the novel
software to the challenging case of OH spectra in surface streamer discharges

barrier discharge is characterised by ICCD and electrical measurements, the
spatially and phase resolved rotational temperatures from N$_2$ (C-B) and

that OH(A) states with quantum numbers (v' = 0, 9 $\leq$ N' $\leq$ 13) are
overpopulated with respect to the found two-Boltzmann distribution. We
hypothesise that fast vibrational-energy transfer is responsible for this

proposals are generated and then filtered by pre-trained object/part models.
This is computationally expensive and not scalable once the number of

data-driven method for object and part localization. Given an unlabeled test
image, our approach transfers annotations from a few similar images retrieved
in the training set. In particular, we propose an iterative transfer strategy
that gradually refine the predicted bounding boxes. Based on the located

to target language programs reflects and preserves behavioural equivalence.
Such compilers have important security benefits, as they limit the power of an
attacker interacting with the program in the target language to that of an
attacker interacting with the program in the source language. Proving compiler
full-abstraction is, however, rather complicated. A common proof technique is
based on the back-translation of target-level program contexts to
behaviourally-equivalent source-level contexts. However, constructing such a
back- translation is problematic when the source language is not strong enough
to embed an encoding of the target language. For instance, when compiling from
STLC to ULC, the lack of recursive types in the former prevents such a
back-translation.
  We propose a general and elegant solution for this problem. The key insight
is that it suffices to construct an approximate back-translation. The
approximation is only accurate up to a certain number of steps and conservative
beyond that, in the sense that the context generated by the back-translation
may diverge when the original would not, but not vice versa. Based on this
insight, we describe a general technique for proving compiler full-abstraction
and demonstrate it on a compiler from STLC to ULC. The proof uses asymmetric
cross-language logical relations and makes innovative use of step-indexing to
express the relation between a context and its approximate back-translation.
The proof extends easily to common compiler patterns such as modular
compilation and it, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first compiler full
abstraction proof to have been fully mechanised in Coq. We believe this proof
technique can scale to challenging settings and enable simpler, more scalable
proofs of compiler full-abstraction.

part in visual perception at different levels of abstraction, i.e.,
superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels. One important question is to
identify the ""entry"" level at which the visual representation is commenced in
the process of object recognition. For a long time, it was believed that the
basic level had advantage over two others; a claim that has been challenged
recently. Here we used a series of psychophysics experiments, based on a rapid
presentation paradigm, as well as two computational models, with bandpass
filtered images to study the processing order of the categorization levels. In
these experiments, we investigated the type of visual information required for
categorizing objects in each level by varying the spatial frequency bands of
the input image. The results of our psychophysics experiments and computational
models are consistent. They indicate that the different spatial frequency
information had different effects on object categorization in each level. In
the absence of high frequency information, subordinate and basic level
categorization are performed inaccurately, while superordinate level is
performed well. This means that, low frequency information is sufficient for
superordinate level, but not for the basic and subordinate levels. These finer
levels require high frequency information, which appears to take longer to be
processed, leading to longer reaction times. Finally, to avoid the ceiling
effect, we evaluated the robustness of the results by adding different amounts
of noise to the input images and repeating the experiments. As expected, the
categorization accuracy decreased and the reaction time increased
significantly, but the trends were the same.This shows that our results are not
due to a ceiling effect.

is following the evolution of the concept of a dense core in stars, which was
important both for an understanding of stellar evolution and as a testing
ground for the fast-evolving field of nuclear physics. In spite of the divide
between physicists and astrophysicists, some key actors working in the
cross-fertilized soil of overlapping but different scientific cultures
formulated models and tentative theories that gradually evolved into more
realistic and structured astrophysical objects. These investigations culminated
in the first contact with general relativity in 1939, when J. Robert
Oppenheimer and his students George Volkoff and Hartland Snyder systematically
applied the theory to the dense core of a collapsing neutron star. This
pioneering application of Einstein's theory to an astrophysical compact object
can be regarded as a milestone in the path eventually leading to the emergence
of relativistic astrophysics in the early 1960s.

metastases. Here we propose that this effect may be due to the fact that
resection of primary tumor results in a decrease in the total systemic amount
of angiogenesis stimulators, such as VEGF and bFGF. This in turn causes
decrease in the systemic level of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as PF-4 and
TSP-1, which at least temporarily relieves inhibition of secondary tumors,
allowing them to grow. This construct is predicated on the notion that systemic
level of angiogenesis inhibitors is regulated by the systemic level of
angiogenesis stimulators, as the host is trying to maintain the homeostatic
balance of stimulators to inhibitors in the body. We evaluate this hypothesis
using a conceptual mathematical model and show that indeed, this mechanism can
explain accelerated growth of secondary tumors following resection of a primary
tumor. We also show that there exists a tradeoff between time of surgery and
time to onset of metastatic growth. We conclude with a discussion of possible
therapeutic approaches that may counteract this effect and reduce metastatic
recurrences after surgery.

common technique for addressing this multiple testing problem is to adjust the
procedure in a way that controls the proportion of true null hypotheses that
are incorrectly rejected, or the false discovery rate (FDR). Unfortunately,
generic FDR procedures suffer from low power when the hypotheses are dependent,
and techniques designed to account for dependence are sensitive to
misspecification of the underlying statistical model. In this paper, we develop
a Bayesian decision theoretic approach for dependent multiple testing and a
nonparametric hierarchical statistical model that flexibly controls false

accounts for generic spatial dependence and allows the practitioner to flexibly
specify the decision criteria. Finally, we apply our procedure to several

uncertainty due to a lack of data is fundamental in machine learning. A basic
instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and
costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise
the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that
a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a
threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range
of cost functions other than the posterior variance.
  This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian
control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies
that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a
well-defined Whittle index. We discuss computation of that index, give
closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated
index policy with heuristic policies.
  The proof is based on a new verification theorem that demonstrates threshold
structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary
sequences known as mechanical words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear
maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology.

for some class of probability measures yields a formula for the covariance of
two functions (of a stochastic variable). In comparison with the Brascamp--Lieb
inequality, this formula is a more flexible and in some contexts stronger means
for the analysis of correlation asymptotics in statistical mechanics. Using a
fine version of the Closed Range Theorem, the identity's validity is shown to
be equivalent to some explicitly given spectral properties of Witten-Laplacians
on Euclidean space, and the formula is moreover deduced from the obtained
abstract expression for the range projection. As a corollary, a generalised
version of Brascamp--Lieb's inequality is obtained. For a certain class of
measures occurring in statistical mechanics, explicit criteria for the means
are found from the Persson--Agmon formula, from compactness of embeddings and
from the Weyl calculus of pseudo-differential operators, which give results for
closed range, strict positivity, essential self-adjointness and domain
characterisations.

first successful application of the (pseudo-)high dilution method to the
conditions of on-surface synthesis in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). This approach
leads to high yields (up to 84%) of cyclic hyperbenzene ([18]-honeycombene) via
an Ullmann-type reaction from 4,4""-dibromo-meta-terphenyl (DMTP) as precursor
on a Ag(111) surface. The mechanism of macrocycle formation was explored in
detail using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS). We propose that hyperbenzene (MTP)6 forms majorly by
stepwise desilverization of an organometallic (MTP-Ag)6 macrocycle, which
preforms via cyclisation of (MTP-Ag)6 chains under pseudo-high dilution
condition. The high probability of cyclisation on the stage of the
organometallic phase results from the reversibility of the C-Ag bond. The case
is different from that in solution, in which cyclisation typically occurs on
the stage of covalently bonded open-chain precursor. This difference in the
cyclisation mechanism on a surface compared to that in solution stems mainly
from the 2D confinement exerted by the surface template, which to a large
extent prevents the flipping of chain segments necessary for cyclisation.

that the triggering of the blowout jet was due to the emergence and
cancellation of magnetic fluxes on the photosphere. During the rising stage of
the jet, the EUV wave appeared just ahead of the jet top, lasting about 4
minutes and at a speed of 458 - \speed{762}. In addition, obvious dark material
is observed along the EUV jet body, which confirms the observation of a
mini-filament eruption at the jet base in the chromosphere. Interestingly, two
distinct but overlapped CME structures can be observed in corona together with
the eruption of the blowout jet. One is in narrow jet-shape, while the other
one is in bubble-shape. The jet-shaped component was unambiguously related with
the outwardly running jet itself, while the bubble-like one might either be
produced due to the reconstruction of the high coronal fields or by the
internal reconnection during the mini-filament ejection according to the

One way is to use abstract machines that pass a token on a fixed graph along a
path indicated by the GoI. These token-passing abstract machines are space
efficient, because they handle duplicated computation by repeating the same
moves of a token on the fixed graph. Although they can be adapted to obtain
sound models with regard to the equational theories of various evaluation
strategies for the lambda calculus, it can be at the expense of significant
time costs. In this paper we show a token-passing abstract machine that can
implement evaluation strategies for the lambda calculus, with certified time
efficiency. Our abstract machine, called the Dynamic GoI Machine (DGoIM),
rewrites the graph to avoid replicating computation, using the token to find
the redexes. The flexibility of interleaving token transitions and graph
rewriting allows the DGoIM to balance the trade-off of space and time costs.
This paper shows that the DGoIM can implement call-by-need evaluation for the
lambda calculus by using a strategy of interleaving token passing with as much
graph rewriting as possible. Our quantitative analysis confirms that the DGoIM
with this strategy of interleaving the two kinds of possible operations on
graphs can be classified as ""efficient"" following Accattoli's taxonomy of
abstract machines.

transport of electrons in the energy range between 1 keV and 10 MeV has been
studied using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code system. We have extended the electron
degradation spectra calculations down to 200 eV by solving an integral equation
derived from the cavity integral formulation for the absorbed dose. The present
study confirms the constancy of the w value in the megavoltage energy range
though our calculation method is not capable of accurately predicting its
absolute value. When the average electron energy falls below several keV, it is
well known that w exhibits an increase in its absolute value which our
calculations also indicate.

function on the unit interval which is needed for fast function evaluation.
This paper presents a variation of their result. To make the above statement
precise, one has to specify what a ""set of information"" is and what ""fast""
should mean. Kawamura and Cook use polynomial-time computability in the sense
of second-order complexity theory to define what ""fast"" means but do not use
the most general ""sets of information"" this framework is able to handle.
Instead they require codes to be length-monotone. This paper removes the
additional premise of length-monotonicity, and instead imposes further
conditions on the speed of the evaluation: The operation should now be
computable in ""hyper-linear"" time. This means that the running time can not
contain any iterations of the length function and, while an arbitrary
polynomial may be applied to its value, on the argument side at most a shift by
a constant is allowed. This is a very restrictive notion, but one can check
that the Kawamura and Cook representation allows for hyper-linear time
evaluation. The paper proves that it is not minimal with this property by
providing the minimal set of information necessary for hyper-linear evaluation
and proving that it is not polynomial-time equivalent to any encoding using
only length-monotone names. Ultimatively, this is due to a failure of
polynomial-time computability of an upper bound to a modulus of continuity.
Indeed this failure seems to reflect the behavior of software based on the
ideas of computable analysis appropriately and was one of the reasons for a
closer investigation in the first place.

develop a semi-analytical method for calculating the probability that two

simplified analytical form to describe how the mutual inclination between two
planets evolves due to secular interactions with a wide orbit inclined planet
and use this to determine the mean probability that the two inner planets are
observed to transit. From application to Kepler-48 and HD-106315 we constrain
the inclinations of the outer planets in these systems (known from RV). We also
apply this work to the so called Kepler Dichotomy, which describes the excess
of single transiting systems observed by Kepler. We find 3 different ways of
explaining this dichotomy: some systems could be inherently single, some
multi-planet systems could have inherently large mutual inclinations, while
some multi-planet systems could cyclically attain large mutual inclinations
through interaction with an inclined outer planet. We show how the different
mechanisms can be combined to fit the observed populations of Kepler systems
with one and two transiting planets. We also show how the distribution of
mutual inclinations of transiting two planet systems constrains the fraction of
two planet systems that have perturbing outer planets, since such systems
should be preferentially discovered by Kepler when the inner planets are
coplanar due to an increased transit probability.

be due to a non-magnetic heating component in their atmospheres. With the
exceptions noted above, preliminary results suggest that the average heating

times as in a matter dominated epoch until the scale factor reaches a minimum,
after which it starts expanding. While such scenarios are known to lead to
scale invariant spectra of primordial perturbations after the bounce, the
challenge has been to construct completely symmetric bounces that lead to a
tensor-to-scalar ratio which is small enough to be consistent with the recent
cosmological data. In this work, we construct a model involving two scalar
fields (a canonical field and a non-canonical ghost field) to drive the
symmetric matter bounce and study the evolution of the scalar perturbations in
the model. If we consider the scale associated with the bounce to be of the
order of the Planck scale, the model is completely described in terms of only
one parameter, viz the value of the scale factor at the bounce. We evolve the
scalar perturbations numerically across the bounce and evaluate the scalar
power spectra after the bounce. We show that, while the scalar and tensor
perturbation spectra are scale invariant over scales of cosmological interest,
the tensor-to-scalar ratio proves to be much smaller than the current upper

automatically using conventional classification methods. The dialect

under-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region. In this paper, we
start by analyzing statistically Algerian dialects in order to capture their
specificities related to prosody information which are extracted at utterance
level after a coarse-grained consonant/vowel segmentation. According to these
analysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken
Arabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID). It takes advantage from the
fact that dialects have an inherent property of naturally structured into
hierarchy. Within HADID, a top-down hierarchical classification is applied, in
which we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) method to build a local classifier for
every parent node into the hierarchy dialect structure. Our framework is
implemented and evaluated on Algerian Arabic dialects corpus. Whereas, the
hierarchy dialect structure is deduced from historic and linguistic knowledges.
The results reveal that within {\HD}, the best classifier is DNNs compared to
Support Vector Machine. In addition, compared with a baseline Flat
classification system, our HADID gives an improvement of 63.5% in term of
precision. Furthermore, overall results evidence the suitability of our
prosody-based HADID for speaker independent dialect identification while
requiring less than 6s test utterances.

$\left\langle\mathcal{N}_\mathrm{tot}\right\rangle\sim\exp{(r\,L)}$ with its

generalised Lyapunov exponent (GLE) which is a moment-generating function
characterising the large-deviation type fluctuations of the solution to the
initial value problem associated with the random Schr\""odinger operator of the
1D Anderson localization problem. For strong confinement, the rate $r$ is small
and given by a non-perturbative (instanton, Lifshitz tail-like) contribution to
GLE. For weak confinement, the rate $r$ is found to be proportional to the
inverse Larkin length of the pinning theory. As an application, identifying the
depinning with a landscape ""topology trivialization"" phenomenon, we obtain an
upper bound for the depinning threshold $f_c$, in the presence of an applied
force, for elastic lines and $d$-dimensional manifolds, expressed through the
mean modulus of the spectral determinant of the Laplace operators with a random
potential. We also discuss the question of counting of stable equilibria.
Finally, we extend the method to calculate the asymptotic number of equilibria
at fixed energy (elastic, potential and total), and obtain the (annealed)
distribution of the energy density over these equilibria (i.e. force-free
configurations). Some connections with the Larkin model are also established.

enabled unprecedented control over light absorption and excited charges,

into a 2D array of SiO2 nanocylinders, and experimentally prove a powerful
concept: the resulting metamaterial preserves the radiative properties of the
Si-NCs and inherits the spectrally-selective absorption properties of the
nanocylinders. This hierarchical approach provides increased photoluminescence
(PL) intensity obtained without utilizing any lossy plasmonic components. We
perform rigorous calculations and predict that a freestanding metamaterial
enables tunable absorption peaks up to 50% in the visible spectrum, in
correspondence of the nanocylinder Mie resonances and of the grating condition
in the array. We experimentally detect extinction spectral peaks in the
metamaterial, which drive enhanced absorption in the Si-NCs. Consequently, the
metamaterial features increased PL intensity, obtained without affecting the PL
lifetime, angular pattern and extraction efficiency. Remarkably, our
best-performing metamaterial shows +30% PL intensity achieved with a lower
amount of Si-NCs, compared to an equivalent planar film without nanocylinders,
resulting in a 3-fold average PL enhancement per Si-NC. The principle
demonstrated here is general and the Si-NCs can be replaced with other
semiconductor quantum dots, rare-earth ions or organic molecules. Similarly,
the dielectric medium can be adjusted on purpose. This spectral selectivity of
absorption paves the way for an effective light down-conversion scheme to
increase the efficiency of solar cells. We envision the use of this
hierarchical design for other efficient photovoltaic, photo-catalytic and
artificial photosynthetic devices with spectrally-selective absorption and
enhanced efficiency.

  Methods. We have built a kinematic flux transport model of the solar dynamo
based on the Babcock-Leighton framework. We constructed the source term for the
poloidal field using SOLIS magnetograms spanning three solar cycles. Based on
this source we calculated the azimuthal flux below the surface. The flux
transport model has two free parameters which we constrain using sunspot
observations from cycle 22. We compared the model results with observations
from cycle 23.
  Results. The structure of the azimuthal field is mainly axisymmetric. The
departures from axisymmetry represent, on average, ~3% of the total azimuthal
flux. Owing to its relative weakness, the non-axisymmetric structure of the
azimuthal field does not have a significant impact on the location in which the
emergences appear or on the amount of flux contained in them. We find that the
probability of emergence is a function of the ratio between the flux content of
an active region and the underlying azimuthal flux.

uncover the transition of surface patterns, two dimensional plane strain
simulations are performed on the defected bilayer subjected to uniaxial
compression. Although the substrate is considered as the linear elastic
material, the presence of defects can directly trigger the formation of locally
ridged and then folding configurations from flat surface with a relatively
small compressive strain. It is followed by the coexisting phases of folds and
wrinkles under further overall compression. This phase transition reverses the
traditional transition of wrinkle to ridge or fold for defect free substrates.
It is also found that the onset of initial bifurcation is highly dependent on
the spatial configuration and geometries of holes, since the interaction of
defects allows more strain relief mechanisms beyond wrinkling. Furthermore, a
rich diversity of periodic surface topologies, including overall waves,
localizations, saw like and coexisting features of folds and wrinkles can be
obtained by varying the diameter, depth and spacing of holes as well as
compressive strain, which provides a potential approach to engineer various

progress in the last decade, prompting further exploration of the chemistry of
such materials. Doping and hydrogenating graphene is an experimentally realised
method of changing its surface chemistry, but there is still a great deal to be
understood on how doping impacts on the adsorption of molecules. Developing
this understanding is key to unlocking the potential applications of these
materials. High throughput screening methods can provide particularly effective
ways to explore vast chemical compositions of materials. Here, alchemical
derivatives are used as a method to screen the dissociative adsorption energy
of water molecules on various BN doped topologies of hydrogenated graphene. The
predictions from alchemical derivatives are assessed by comparison to density
functional theory. This screening method is found to predict dissociative
adsorption energies that span a range of more than 2 eV, with a mean absolute
error $<0.1$ eV. In addition, we show that the quality of such predictions can
be readily assessed by examination of the Kohn-Sham highest occupied molecular
orbital in the initial states. In this way, the root mean square error in the
dissociative adsorption energies of water is reduced by almost an order of
magnitude (down to $\sim0.02$ eV) after filtering out poor predictions. The
findings point the way towards a reliable use of first order alchemical
derivatives for efficient screening procedures.

communications (MCs) for a network consisting of several sensors and a fusion
center (FC). If a sensor detects an abnormality, it injects into the medium a
number of molecules which is proportional to the sensed value. Two transmission
schemes for releasing molecules into the medium are considered. In the first
scheme, referred to as DTM, each sensor releases a different type of molecule,
whereas in the second scheme, referred to as STM, all sensors release the same
type of molecule. The molecules released by the sensors propagate through the
MC channel and some may reach the FC where the final decision regarding whether
or not an abnormality has occurred is made. We derive the optimal decision
rules for both DTM and STM. However, the optimal detectors entail high
computational complexity as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) have to be computed.
To overcome this issue, we show that the optimal decision rule for STM can be
transformed into an equivalent low-complexity decision rule. Since a similar
transformation is not possible for DTM, we propose simple low-complexity
sub-optimal detectors based on different approximations of the LLR. The
proposed low-complexity detectors are more suitable for practical MC systems
than the original complex optimal decision rule, particularly when the FC is a
nano-machine with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore, we analyze
the performance of the proposed detectors in terms of their false alarm and
missed detection probabilities. Simulation results verify our analytical
derivations and reveal interesting insights regarding the trade-off between
complexity and performance of the proposed detectors and the considered DTM and
STM schemes.

self-dual noncommutative connective. The logic is defined by means of
proof-nets, rather than a sequent calculus. Later a deep inference system BV
was developed with an eye to capturing Pomset logic, but equivalence of system
has not been proven up to now. As for a sequent calculus formulation, it has
not been known for either of these logics, and there are convincing arguments
that such a sequent calculus in the usual sense simply does not exist for them.
In an on-going work on semantics we discovered a system similar to Pomset
logic, where a noncommutative connective is no longer self-dual. Pomset logic
appears as a degeneration, when the class of models is restricted. Motivated by
these semantic considerations, we define in the current work a semicommutative
multiplicative linear logic}, which is multiplicative linear logic extended
with two nonisomorphic noncommutative connectives (not to be confused with very
different Abrusci-Ruet noncommutative logic). We develop a syntax of proof-nets
and show how this logic degenerates to Pomset logic. However, a more
interesting problem than just finding yet another noncommutative logic is to
find a sequent calculus for this logic. We introduce decorated sequents, which
are sequents equipped with an extra structure of a binary relation of
reachability on formulas. We define a decorated sequent calculus for
semicommutative logic and prove that it is cut-free, sound and complete. This
is adapted to ""degenerate"" variations, including Pomset logic. Thus, in
particular, we give a variant of sequent calculus formulation for Pomset logic,
which is one of the key results of the paper.

quantum world. However, in addition to the ""quantum system of interest,"" there
are many other systems ""of no interest"" in the Universe that can imprint

articulated pose and RGB frames and propose a two-stream approach. The pose
stream is processed with a convolutional model taking as input a 3D tensor
holding data from a sub-sequence. A specific joint ordering, which respects the
topology of the human body, ensures that different convolutional layers
correspond to meaningful levels of abstraction. The raw RGB stream is handled
by a spatio-temporal soft-attention mechanism conditioned on features from the
pose network. An LSTM network receives input from a set of image locations at
each instant. A trainable glimpse sensor extracts features on a set of
predefined locations specified by the pose stream, namely the 4 hands of the
two people involved in the activity. Appearance features give important cues on
hand motion and on objects held in each hand. We show that it is of high
interest to shift the attention to different hands at different time steps
depending on the activity itself. Finally a temporal attention mechanism learns
how to fuse LSTM features over time. We evaluate the method on 3 datasets.
State-of-the-art results are achieved on the largest dataset for human activity

breaking of a conservation law by quantum fluctuations. For instance, the
number of Weyl fermions of each chirality is not independently conserved in
parallel electric and magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral anomaly.
In addition, an underlying curved spacetime provides a distinct contribution to
a chiral imbalance, an effect known as the mixed axial-gravitational anomaly,
which remains experimentally elusive. However, the presence of a mixed
gauge-gravitational anomaly has recently been tied to thermoelectrical
transport in a magnetic field, even in flat spacetime, opening the door to
experimentally probe such type of anomalies in Weyl semimetals. Using a

different ontologies in diverse fields.After discovering the alignments,several
performance scores are available to evaluate them.The scores typically require
the identified alignment and a reference containing the underlying actual
correspondences of the given ontologies.The current trend in the alignment
evaluation is to put forward a new score(e.g., precision, weighted precision,
etc.)and to compare various alignments by juxtaposing the obtained scores.
However,it is substantially provocative to select one measure among others for
comparison.On top of that, claiming if one system has a better performance than
one another cannot be substantiated solely by comparing two scalars.In this
paper,we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to theoretically
favor one system over one another.The McNemar's test is the statistical means
by which the comparison of two ontology alignment systems over one matching
task is drawn.The test applies to a 2x2 contingency table which can be
constructed in two different ways based on the alignments,each of which has
their own merits/pitfalls.The ways of the contingency table construction and
various apposite statistics from the McNemar's test are elaborated in minute
detail.In the case of having more than two alignment systems for comparison,
the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. Thus, the ways of preventing
such an error are also discussed.A directed graph visualizes the outcome of the
McNemar's test in the presence of multiple alignment systems.From this graph,
it is readily understood if one system is better than one another or if their
differences are imperceptible.The proposed statistical methodologies are

overcome some important drawbacks of the Al-Mg alloys, such as poor formability
and large springback. However, the numerical simulation of these processes
requires the adoption of coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis,
using temperature-dependent material models. The numerical description of the
thermo-mechanical behaviour can require a large set of experimental tests.
These experimental tests should be performed under conditions identical to the
ones observed in the forming process. In this study, the warm deep drawing of a
cylindrical cup is analysed, including the split-ring test to assess the
temperature effect on the springback. Based on the analysis of the forming
process conditions, the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the AA5086 aluminium
alloy is described by a rate-independent thermo-elasto-plastic material model.
The hardening law adopted is temperature-dependent while the yield function is
temperature-independent. Nevertheless, the yield criterion parameters are
selected based on the temperature of the heated tools. In fact, the model
assumes that the temperature of the tools is uniform and constant, adopting a
variable interfacial heat transfer coefficient. The accuracy of the proposed
finite element model is assessed by comparing numerical and experimental
results. The predicted punch force, thickness distribution and earing profile
are in very good agreement with the experimental measurements, when the
anisotropic behaviour of the blank is accurately described. However, this does
not guarantee a correct springback prediction, which is strongly influenced by
the elastic properties, namely the Young's modulus.

nanophotonics because it enables sensitive control of photons' spin degree of
freedom and thereby the trajectory of the photons, which is useful for
applications such as signal encoding and routing. A recent study showed that
the SOI of photons manifests in the presence of a gradient in the permittivity
of the medium through which the photons propagate; this enhances the scattering
of circularly polarized light and results in the photons propagating along
twisted trajectories. Here we theoretically predict that, because of the
equivalence between an inhomogeneous dielectric medium and a gravitational
field demonstrated in transformation optics, a significant SOI is induced onto
circularly polarized light passing by the gravitational lens of a black hole.
This leads to: i) the photons to propagate along chiral trajectories if the
size of the blackhole is smaller than the wavelength of the incident photons,
ii) the resulting image of the gravitational lens to manifest an azimuthal
rotation because of these chiral trajectories. The findings open for a way to
probe for and discover subwavelength-size black holes using circularly

radiative transfer codes to predict the molecular line or continuum emission.
An analysis of the output hyper-spectral cube given by such radiative transfer
code can be made directly in GASS using the various post-treatment options
implemented, such as calculation of moments or convolution with a beam. This
makes GASS well suited to model and analyse both interferometric and
single-dish data. This paper is focused on the results given by the association
of GASS and LIME, a 3D radiative transfer code, and we show that the complex
geometry observed in star-forming regions can be adequately handled by
GASS+LIME.

  interaction","25 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding the interaction between the valves and walls of the heart is
important in assessing and subsequently treating heart dysfunction. With
advancements in cardiac imaging, nonlinear mechanics and computational
techniques, it is now possible to explore the mechanics of valve-heart
interactions using anatomically and physiologically realistic models. This
study presents an integrated model of the mitral valve (MV) coupled to the left
ventricle (LV), with the geometry derived from in vivo clinical magnetic
resonance images. Numerical simulations using this coupled MV-LV model are
developed using an immersed boundary/finite element method. The model
incorporates detailed valvular features, left ventricular contraction,
nonlinear soft tissue mechanics, and fluid-mediated interactions between the MV
and LV wall. We use the model to simulate the cardiac function from diastole to
systole, and investigate how myocardial active relaxation function affects the
LV pump function. The results of the new model agree with in vivo measurements,
and demonstrate that the diastolic filling pressure increases significantly
with impaired myocardial active relaxation to maintain the normal cardiac
output. The coupled model has the potential to advance fundamental knowledge of
mechanisms underlying MV-LV interaction, and help in risk stratification and
optimization of therapies for heart diseases.

that provide the same structure for the Henstock-Kurzweil (HK) integrable
functions as the $L^p$ spaces provide for the Lebesgue integrable functions.
These spaces also contain the wide sense Denjoy integrable functions. They were
first use to provide the foundations for the Feynman formulation of quantum
mechanics. It has recently been observed that these spaces contain the test
functions $\mathcal{D}$ as a continuous dense embedding. Thus, by the
Hahn-Banach theorem, $\mathcal{D}' \subset \mathcal{B}'$. A new family that
extend the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation $BMO[\mathbb{R}^n]$,
to include the HK-integrable functions are also introduced. We provide a few
applications. We use ${KS}^2$ to provide a simple solution to the generator
(with unbounded coefficients) problem for Markov processes. We also use $SD^2$
to provide the best possible a priori bound for the nonlinear term of the
Navier-Stokes equation.

So said Nobel laureate
Richard Feynman, and by his metric, we understand a bit about physics, less
about chemistry, and almost nothing about biology.
  When we fully understand a phenomenon, we can specify its entire sequence of
events, causes, and effects so completely that it is possible to fully simulate
it, with all its internal mechanisms intact. Achieving that level of
understanding is rare. It is commensurate with constructing a full design for a
machine that could serve as a stand-in for the thing being studied. To
understand a phenomenon sufficiently to fully simulate it is to understand it
computationally.
  'Computation' does not refer to computers per se. Rather, it refers to the
underlying principles and methods that make them work. As Turing Award
recipient Edsger Dijkstra said, computational science 'is no more about
computers than astronomy is about telescopes.' Computational science is the
study of the hidden rules underlying complex phenomena from physics to
psychology.
  Computational neuroscience, then, has the aim of understanding brains
sufficiently well to be able to simulate their functions, thereby subsuming the
twin goals of science and engineering: deeply understanding the inner workings
of our brains, and being able to construct simulacra of them. As simple robots
today substitute for human physical abilities, in settings from factories to
hospitals, so brain engineering will construct stand-ins for our mental
abilities, and possibly even enable us to fix our brains when they break.

partially coherent sources is a major challenge in array signal processing.
Though many subspace- based algorithms are available in literature, none of
them tackle the problem of resolving coherent sources directly, e.g. without
modifying the sample data covariance matrix. Compressive Sensing (CS) based
sparse recovery algorithms are being applied as a novel technique to this area.
In this paper, we introduce Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to the DOA
estimation problem. We demonstrate how a DOA estimation problem can be modelled
for sparse recovery problem and then exploited using OMP to obtain the set of
DOAs. Moreover, this algorithm uses only one snapshot to obtain the results.
The simulation results demonstrate the validity and advantages of using OMP
algorithm over the existing subspace- based algorithms.
