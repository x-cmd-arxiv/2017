  Within Populations",,,,,"cs.IR cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A growing body of research focuses on computationally detecting controversial
topics and understanding the stances people hold on them. Yet gaps remain in
our theoretical and practical understanding of how to define controversy, how
it manifests, and how to measure it. In this paper, we introduce a novel
measure we call ""contention"", defined with respect to a topic and a population.
We model contention from a mathematical standpoint. We validate our model by
examining a diverse set of sources: real-world polling data sets, actual voter
data, and Twitter coverage on several topics. In our publicly-released Twitter
data set of nearly 100M tweets, we examine several topics such as Brexit, the
2016 U.S. Elections, and ""The Dress"", and cross-reference them with other
sources. We demonstrate that the contention measure holds explanatory power for
a wide variety of observed phenomena, such as controversies over climate change
and other topics that are well within scientific consensus. Finally, we
re-examine the notion of controversy, and present a theoretical framework that
defines it in terms of population. We present preliminary evidence suggesting
that contention is one dimension of controversy, along with others, such as
""importance"". Our new contention measure, along with the hypothesized model of
controversy, suggest several avenues for future work in this emerging
interdisciplinary research area.

$f(x)$. The total influence $I(f)$ is the sum of influences of the coordinates.
The well-known `Junta Theorem' of Friedgut (1998) asserts that if $I(f) \leq

$O(2^{M/\epsilon})$ coordinates. Friedgut's theorem has a wide variety of
applications in mathematics and theoretical computer science.
  For a biased function with $E[f]=\mu$, the edge isoperimetric inequality on
the cube implies that $I(f) \geq 2\mu \log(1/\mu)$. Kahn and Kalai (2006)
asked, in the spirit of the Junta theorem, whether any $f$ such that $I(f)$ is
within a constant factor of the minimum, can be $\epsilon \mu$-approximated by
a DNF of a `small' size (i.e., a union of a small number of sub-cubes). We
answer the question by proving the following structure theorem: If $I(f) \leq
2\mu(\log(1/\mu)+M)$, then $f$ can be $\epsilon \mu$-approximated by a DNF of
size $2^{2^{O(M/\epsilon)}}$. The dependence on $M$ is sharp up to the constant

theories surface charges disentangle physical from gauge symmetries through the
use of Noether identities and the exactness symmetry condition. The surface
charges are quasilocal, explicitly coordinate independent, gauge invariant, and
background independent. For a black hole family solution the surface charge
conservation implies the first law of black hole mechanics. As a check we show
the first law for black hole electrically charged, rotating, and with an
asymptotically constant curvature (the Kerr-Newman (anti-)de Sitter family).
The charges, including the would-be mass term appearing in the first law, are
quasilocal. It is not required a reference to the asymptotic structure of the

mechanisms, first by phosphorylation at, and second by reduction and oxidation
of the Cys504 residues of two adjacent subunits. Here, we analyzed the effects
of this redox switch on the protein in vitro combined with force field
molecular dynamics (MD). Earlier X-ray data contain the structure of the rigid
body of the molecule but lack the flexible C-terminus with the important sites
for phosphorylation and redox regulation. An in silico model for this part was
established by replica exchange simulations and homology modelling, which is
consistent with results gained from CD spectroscopy with recombinant protein.
Thermofluor data indicated that the protein aggregates at bivalent ion
concentrations below 200 mM. In simulations the protein surface was covered at
these conditions by large amounts of ions, which most likely prevent
aggregation. A tryptophan residue (Trp295) in close proximity to the forming
disulfide allowed the measurement of the structural relaxation of the rigid
body upon reduction by fluorescent quenching. We were also able to determine
the second order rate constant of CRMP2 oxidation by H2O2. The simulated
solvent accessible surface of the hydroxyl group of Ser518 significantly
increased upon reduction of the disulfide bond. Our results give first detailed
insight in the profound structural changes of the tetrameric CRMP2 due to
oxidation and indicate a tightly connected regulation by phosphorylation and
redox modification.

and has been extensively studied using both analytical and numerical methods.
This test can also be combined with the Demeri test, which consists in cutting
a ring from the wall of a cylindrical cup, in order to open it afterwards to
measure the springback. This combination allows their use as benchmark test, in
order to improve the knowledge concerning the numerical simulation models,
through the comparison between experimental and numerical results. The focus of
this study is the experimental and numerical analyses of the Swift cup test,
followed by the Demeri test, performed with an AA5754-O alloy at room
temperature. In this context, a detailed analysis of the punch force evolution,
the thickness evolution along the cup wall, the earing profile, the strain
paths and their evolution and the ring opening is performed. The numerical
simulation is performed using the finite element code ABAQUS, with solid and
solid-shell elements, in order to compare the computational efficiency of these
type of elements. The results show that the solid-shell element is more
cost-effective than the solid, presenting global accurate predictions, excepted
for the thinning zones. Both the von Mises and the Hill48 yield criteria
predict the strain distributions in the final cup quite accurately. However,
improved knowledge concerning the stress states is still required, because the
Hill48 criterion showed difficulties in the correct prediction of the
springback, whatever the type of finite element adopted.

investigated from the viewpoint that the initial arities of all operations are
arbitrary. Relations between operations arising from the structure definitions,
however, lead to restrictions which determine their possible arity shapes and
lead us to the partial arity freedom principle. In this manner, polyadic vector
spaces and algebras, dual vector spaces, direct sums, tensor products and inner
pairing spaces are reconsidered. As one application, elements of polyadic
operator theory are outlined: multistars and polyadic analogs of adjoints,
operator norms, isometries and projections are introduced, as well as polyadic
C*-algebras, Toeplitz algebras and Cuntz algebras represented by polyadic
operators. Another application is connected with number theory, and it is shown
that congruence classes are polyadic rings of a special kind. Polyadic numbers
are introduced (see Definition 6.16), and Diophantine equations over these
polyadic rings are then considered. Polyadic analogs of the
Lander-Parkin-Selfridge conjecture and Fermat's last theorem are formulated.
For nonderived polyadic ring operations (on polyadic numbers) neither of these
statements holds, and counterexamples are given. Finally, a procedure for

  of local Hamiltonians",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the relationship between the energy spectrum of a local
Hamiltonian and the geometric properties of its ground state. By generalizing a
standard framework from the analysis of Markov chains to arbitrary
(non-stoquastic) Hamiltonians we are naturally led to see that the spectral gap
can always be upper bounded by an isoperimetric ratio that depends only on the
ground state probability distribution and the range of the terms in the
Hamiltonian, but not on any other details of the interaction couplings. This
means that for a given probability distribution the inequality constrains the
spectral gap of any local Hamiltonian with this distribution as its ground
state probability distribution in some basis (Eldar and Harrow derived a
similar result in order to characterize the output of low-depth quantum
circuits). Going further, we relate the Hilbert space localization properties
of the ground state to higher energy eigenvalues by showing that the presence
of k strongly localized ground state modes (i.e. clusters of probability, or
subsets with small expansion) in Hilbert space implies the presence of k energy
eigenvalues that are close to the ground state energy. Our results suggest that
quantum adiabatic optimization using local Hamiltonians will inevitably
encounter small spectral gaps when attempting to prepare ground states
corresponding to multi-modal probability distributions with strongly localized
modes, and this problem cannot necessarily be alleviated with the inclusion of
non-stoquastic couplings.

evolution of an emerging flux region, the associated photospheric and
chromospheric flow fields, and the properties of the accompanying arch filament
system. Methods. This study is based on imaging spectroscopy with the
G\""ottingen Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope, on 2008
August 7. Cloud model (CM) inversions of line scans in the strong chromospheric
absorption H$\alpha$ line yielded CM parameters, which describe the cool plasma
contained in the arch filament system. Results. The observations cover the
decay and convergence of two micro-pores with diameters of less than one
arcsecond and provide decay rates for intensity and area. The photospheric
horizontal flow speed is suppressed near the two micro-pores indicating that
the magnetic field is sufficiently strong to affect the convective energy
transport. The micro-pores are accompanied by an arch filament system, where
small-scale loops connect two regions with H$\alpha$ line-core brightenings
containing an emerging flux region with opposite polarities. The chromospheric
velocity of the cloud material is predominantly directed downwards near the
footpoints of the loops with velocities of up to 12 km/s, whereas loop tops
show upward motions of about 3 km/s. Conclusions. Micro-pores are the smallest
magnetic field concentrations leaving a photometric signature in the
photosphere. In the observed case, they are accompanied by a miniature arch
filament system indicative of newly emerging flux in the form of
$\Omega$-loops. Flux emergence and decay take place on a time-scale of about
two days, whereas the photometric decay of the micro-pores is much more rapid
(a few hours), which is consistent with the incipient submergence of
$\Omega$-loops. The results are representative for the smallest emerging flux
regions still recognizable as such.

use either huge simulation cells of up to $8\times10^5$ sites, or an embedding
scheme that allows the modelling of a single vacancy in an otherwise pristine
infinite honeycomb lattice. We find three results that stress the anomalous
nature of the magnetic moment ($m$) in this system. First, in the
non-interacting ($U=0$), zero temperature ($T=0$) case, the $m(B)$ is a
continuous smooth curve with divergent susceptibility, different from the
step-wise constant function found for a single unpaired spins in a gapped
system. Second, for $U=0$ and $T>0$, the linear susceptibility follows a power
law $\propto{T}^{-\alpha}$ with an exponent of $\alpha=0.77$ different from
conventional Curie's law. For $U>0$, in the mean field approximation, the
integrated moment is smaller than $m=1\mu_B$, in contrast with results using
periodic unit cells. These three results highlight that the magnetic response
of the local moment induced by sp$^3$ functionalizations in graphene is
different both from that of local moments in gaped systems, for which the
magnetic moment is quantized and follows a Curie law, and from Pauli
paramagnetism in conductors, for which a linear susceptibility can be defined
at $T=0$.

in the quest of achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via
graph-splitting, semi-definite programming, (linearized) belief propagation,

produced at a finite time with energy $E$ by an auxiliary $2\to 2$ sub-process,
with kinematics such that it has sufficient resolution to detect the
longitudinal spreading of an additional incoming string, the `source'. We test
this hypothesis in a gauge-invariant S-matrix calculation convolved with an
appropriate wavepacket peaked at a separation $X$ between the central
trajectories of the source and produced detector. The amplitude exhibits
support for scattering at the predicted longitudinal separation $X\sim\alpha'
E$, in sharp contrast to the analogous quantum field theory amplitude (whose
support manifestly traces out a tail of the position-space wavefunction). The
effect arises in a regime in which the string amplitude is not obtained as a
convergent sum of such QFT amplitudes, and has larger amplitude than similar
QFT models (with the same auxiliary four point amplitude). In a linear dilaton
background, the amplitude depends on the string coupling as expected if the
scattering is not simply occuring on the wavepacket tail in string theory. This
manifests the scale of longitudinal spreading in a gauge-invariant S-matrix
amplitude, in a calculable process with significant amplitude. It simulates a

spectral space (after Hochster), spectral extension of $\Spec(R)$, and that the
assignment $R\mapsto\scal(R)$ induces a contravariant functor. We then relate
-- in the case $R$ is an integral domain -- the topology on $\scal(R)$ with the
Zariski topology on the set of overrings of $R$. Furthermore, we investigate
the relationship between $\scal(R)$ and the space $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}(R)$
consisting of all nonempty inverse-closed subspaces of $\spec(R)$, which has
been introduced and studied in C.A. Finocchiaro, M. Fontana and D. Spirito,
""The space of inverse-closed subsets of a spectral space is spectral""
(submitted). In this context, we show that $\scal( R)$ is a spectral retract of
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}(R)$ and we characterize when $\scal( R)$ is
canonically homeomorphic to $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}(R)$, both in general and
when $\spec(R)$ is a Noetherian space. In particular, we obtain that, when $R$
is a B\'ezout domain, $\scal( R)$ is canonically homeomorphic both to
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}(R)$ and to the space $\overr(R)$ of the overrings of
$R$ (endowed with the Zariski topology). Finally, we compare the space
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}(R)$ with the space $\scal(R(T))$ of semigroup primes
of the Nagata ring $R(T)$, providing a canonical spectral embedding
$\xcal(R)\hookrightarrow\scal(R(T))$ which makes $\xcal(R)$ a spectral retract

framework that combines a variational auto-encoder with a generative
adversarial network, for synthesizing images in fine-grained categories, such
as faces of a specific person or objects in a category. Our approach models an
image as a composition of label and latent attributes in a probabilistic model.
By varying the fine-grained category label fed into the resulting generative
model, we can generate images in a specific category with randomly drawn values
on a latent attribute vector. Our approach has two novel aspects. First, we
adopt a cross entropy loss for the discriminative and classifier network, but a
mean discrepancy objective for the generative network. This kind of asymmetric
loss function makes the GAN training more stable. Second, we adopt an encoder
network to learn the relationship between the latent space and the real image
space, and use pairwise feature matching to keep the structure of generated
images. We experiment with natural images of faces, flowers, and birds, and
demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and
diverse samples with fine-grained category labels. We further show that our
models can be applied to other tasks, such as image inpainting,
super-resolution, and data augmentation for training better face recognition

While the New-Physics effects are then strongly suppressed by the ratio
$m_\mu/m_\tau$ of the lepton masses in $B^0_s\to\tau^+\tau^-$, they are hugely
enhanced by $m_\mu/m_e$ in $B^0_s\to e^+e^-$ and may result in a $B^0_s\to

state of de Sitter using spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries. In the
present paper we reinterpret this effect in terms of particle production and
relate the quantum states with and without soft modes by means of Bogoliubov
transformations. This also enables us to address the much discussed issues
regarding the observability of infrared effects in de Sitter from a new
perspective. While it is commonly agreed that infrared effects are not visible
to a single sub-horizon observer at late times, we argue that the question is
less trivial for a {\it patient observer} who has lived long enough to have a
record of the state before the soft mode was created. Though classically there
is no obstruction to measuring this effect locally, we give several indications
that quantum mechanical uncertainties may censor the effect. We then apply our
methods to find a non-perturbative description of the quantum state pertaining
to the Page time of de Sitter, and derive with these new methods the
probability distribution for the local quantum states of de Sitter and
slow-roll inflation in the presence of long modes. Finally, we use this to
formulate a precise criterion for the existence of eternal inflation in general
classes of slow-roll inflation.

DSFGs. We find a subset (11/31$\approx35$%) of DSFGs with inaccurate ($\Delta
z/(1+z)>0.2$) or non-existent photometric redshifts; these have very distinct
spectral energy distributions from the remaining DSFGs, suggesting a decoupling

that hard ionizing radiation fields are ubiquitous in high-z DSFGs, even more
so than typical mass or UV-selected high-z galaxies. We also confirm the
extreme level of dust obscuration in DSFGs, measuring very high Balmer
decrements, and very high ratios of IR to UV and IR to H$\alpha$ luminosities.

initially detected as a $\sim12\sigma$ overdensity of typical star-forming
galaxies in the blind spectroscopic survey of the early universe ($2<z<6$)
performed by VUDS. It was further mapped using a new technique developed that
statistically combines spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, the latter
derived from a recent compilation of deep multi-band imaging. Through various
methods, the descendant halo mass of PCl J1001+0220 is estimated to be
$\log(M_{h}/M_{\odot})_{z=0}\sim14.5-15$ with a large amount of mass apparently
already in place at $z\sim4.57$. Tentative evidence is found for a fractional
excess of older and more massive galaxies within the proto-cluster, an
observation which suggests the pervasive early onset of vigorous star
formation. No evidence is found for the differences in the star formation rates
of member and a matched sample of coeval field galaxies either through
rest-frame ultraviolet methods or through stacking extremely deep Very Large
Array 3 GHz imaging. Additionally, no evidence for pervasive strong active
galactic nuclei (AGN) activity is observed. Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope
images provides weak evidence for for an elevated incidence of galaxy-galaxy
interaction within the proto-cluster. The spectral properties of the two
samples are compared, with a definite suppression of Ly$\alpha$ seen in the
average member galaxy relative to the coeval field
($f_{esc,Ly\alpha}=1.8^{+0.3}_{-1.7}$% and $4.0^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$%, respectively).
This observation along with other lines of evidence leads us to infer the
possible presence of a large, cool diffuse medium within the proto-cluster
environment evocative of a nascent intracluster medium.

devoid of stars by standard stellar evolution theory. In previous papers we
presented the observed demographics of these sources and defined possible
theoretical formation channels through isolated binary evolution, the rapid
stripping of a subgiant's envelope, and stellar collisions. Sub-subgiants offer
key tests for single- and binary-star evolution and stellar collision models.
In this paper, we synthesize these findings to discuss the formation
frequencies through each of these channels. The empirical data, our analytic
formation rate calculations, and analyses of sub-subgiants in a large grid of
Monte Carlo globular cluster models suggest that the binary evolution channels
may be the most prevalent, though all channels appear to be viable routes to
sub-subgiant creation (especially in higher-mass globular clusters). Multiple
formation channels may operate simultaneously to produce the observed

an enigmatic new class of astrophysical transient. In a 180-day survey of the
Southern sky we discovered 3 FRBs at 843 MHz with the UTMOST array, as part of
commissioning science during a major ongoing upgrade. The wide field of view of
UTMOST ($\approx 9$ deg$^{2}$) is well suited to FRB searches. The primary beam
is covered by 352 partially overlapping fan-beams, each of which is searched
for FRBs in real time with pulse widths in the range 0.655 to 42 ms, and
dispersion measures $\leq$2000 pc cm$^{-3}$. Detections of FRBs with the UTMOST
array places a lower limit on their distances of $\approx 10^4$ km (limit of
the telescope near-field) supporting the case for an astronomical origin.
Repeating FRBs at UTMOST or an FRB detected simultaneously with the Parkes
radio telescope and UTMOST, would allow a few arcsec localisation, thereby
providing an excellent means of identifying FRB host galaxies, if present. Up
to 100 hours of follow-up for each FRB has been carried out with the UTMOST,
with no repeating bursts seen. From the detected position, we present 3$\sigma$
error ellipses of 15 arcsec x 8.4 deg on the sky for the point of origin for
the FRBs. We estimate an all-sky FRB rate at 843 MHz above a fluence $\cal
F_\mathrm{lim}$ of 11 Jy ms of $\sim 78$ events sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at the 95
percent confidence level. The measured rate of FRBs at 843 MHz is of order two
times higher than we had expected, scaling from the FRB rate at the Parkes
radio telescope, assuming that FRBs have a flat spectral index and a uniform
distribution in Euclidean space. We examine how this can be explained by FRBs
having a steeper spectral index and/or a flatter log$N$-log$\mathcal{F}$

medium (IGM) at the end of the epoch of reionization provides a valuable
constraint on the emissivity of the sources which reionized the Universe. While
measurements of the ionizing background at lower redshifts rely on a
simulation-calibrated mapping between the photoionization rate and the mean
transmission of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, at $z\gtrsim6$ the IGM becomes
increasingly opaque, and transmission arises solely in narrow spikes separated
by saturated Gunn-Peterson troughs. In this regime, the traditional approach of
measuring the average transmission over large $\sim 50$ Mpc$/h$ regions is less
sensitive and sub-optimal. Additionally, the five times smaller oscillator
strength of the Ly$\beta$ transition implies the Ly$\beta$ forest is
considerably more transparent at $z\gtrsim6$, even in the presence of
contamination by foreground $z\sim 5$ Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption. In this
work we present a novel statistical approach to analyze the joint distribution
of transmission spikes in the co-spatial $z\sim 6$ Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$
forests. Our method relies on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which
circumvents the necessity of computing the intractable likelihood function
describing the highly correlated Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ transmission. We
apply ABC to mock data generated from a large-volume hydrodynamical simulation
combined with a state-of-the-art model of ionizing background fluctuations in
the post-reionization IGM, and show that it is sensitive to higher IGM neutral
hydrogen fractions than previous techniques. As a proof of concept, we apply
this methodology to a real spectrum of a $z=6.54$ quasar and measure the
ionizing background from $5.4\leq z \leq 6.4$ along this sightline with
$\sim0.2$ dex statistical uncertainties.

galaxies and neighbour galaxies, also known as 'galactic conformity', out to 20
Mpc/h using three semi-analytic models (SAMs, one from L-GALAXIES and other two
from GALFORM). The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic
conformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models,
when the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in
real space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary
galaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same
stellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove
satellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in
GALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is
partially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a
satellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later
time in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the
L-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their
host halo in the past. Galactic conformity is also influenced by primary
galaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of different
masses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In
this case the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in
GALFORM models). Therefore, it seems difficult that conformity is directly
related with a long-range effect.

open strings for the mesons, the 't Hooft large-$N$ expansion of QCD is a
long-standing problem that resisted all the attempts despite the advent of the
celebrated gauge/gravity duality in the framework of string theory. We
demonstrate that in the canonical string framework such a solution does not
actually exist because an inconsistency arises between the renormalization
properties of the QCD S matrix at large $N$ -- a consequence of the asymptotic
freedom (AF) -- and the open/closed duality of the would-be string solution.
Specifically, the would-be open-string one-loop corrections to the tree
glueball amplitudes must be ultraviolet (UV) divergent. Hence, naively, the
inconsistency arises because these amplitudes are dual to tree closed-string
diagrams, which are universally believed to be both UV finite -- since they are
closed-string tree diagrams -- and infrared finite because of the glueball mass
gap. In fact, the inconsistency follows from a low-energy theorem of the NSVZ
type that controls the renormalization in QCD-like theories. The inconsistency
extends to the would-be canonical string for a vast class of 't Hooft large-$N$
QCD-like theories including $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD. We also demonstrate that
the presently existing SUSY string models with a mass gap -- such as
Klebanov-Strassler, Polchinski-Strassler (PS) and certain PS variants -- cannot
contradict the above-mentioned results since they are not asymptotically free.
Moreover, we shed light on the way the open/closed string duality may be
perturbatively realized in these string models compatibly with a mass gap in
the 't Hooft-planar closed-string sector and the low-energy theorem because of
the lack of AF. Finally, we suggest a noncanonical way-out for QCD-like
theories based on topological strings on noncommutative twistor space.

variations is uncertain: either the Universe is still undergoing the process of
He II reionization, or the Universe is highly ionized but the He II-ionizing
background fluctuates significantly on large scales. In an effort to build upon
our understanding of the latter scenario, we present a novel model for the
evolution of ionizing background fluctuations. Previous models have assumed the
mean free path of ionizing photons to be spatially uniform, ignoring the
dependence of that scale on the local ionization state of the intergalactic
medium (IGM). This assumption is reasonable when the mean free path is large
compared to the average distance between the primary sources of He II-ionizing
photons, $\gtrsim L_\star$ quasars. However, when this is no longer the case,
the background fluctuations become more severe, and an accurate description of
the average propagation of ionizing photons through the IGM requires
additionally accounting for the fluctuations in opacity. We demonstrate the
importance of this effect by constructing 3D semi-analytic models of the helium
ionizing background from $z=2.5$-$3.5$ that explicitly include a spatially
varying mean free path of ionizing photons. The resulting distribution of
effective optical depths at large scales in the He II Ly$\alpha$ forest is very
similar to the latest observations with HST/COS at $2.5 \lesssim z \lesssim
3.5$.

than the red giant branch in cluster color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), a region
not easily populated by standard stellar evolution pathways. While there has
been speculation on what mechanisms may create these unusual stars, no
well-developed theory exists to explain their origins. Here we discuss three
hypotheses of SSG formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2)
stripping of a subgiant's envelope, perhaps during a dynamical encounter, and
(3) reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective efficiency
and produce large star spots. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we develop
evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and compare the expected
stellar and orbital properties of these models with six known SSGs in the two
open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of these mechanisms can create stars
or binary systems in the SSG CMD domain. We also calculate the frequency with
which each of these mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the
magnetic field hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency
in open clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected
formation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in open
clusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in higher mass
globular clusters.

  Provably Secure Defense Mechanism",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chip designers outsource chip fabrication to external foundries, but at the
risk of IP theft. Logic locking, a promising solution to mitigate this threat,
adds extra logic gates (key gates) and inputs (key bits) to the chip so that it
functions correctly only when the correct key, known only to the designer but
not the foundry, is applied. In this paper, we identify a new vulnerability in
all existing logic locking schemes. Prior attacks on logic locking have assumed
that, in addition to the design of the locked chip, the attacker has access to
a working copy of the chip. Our attack does not require a working copy and yet
we successfully recover a significant fraction of key bits from the design of
the locked chip only. Empirically, we demonstrate the success of our attack on
eight large benchmark circuits from a benchmark suite that has been tailored
specifically for logic synthesis research, for two different logic locking
schemes. Then, to address this vulnerability, we initiate the study of provably
secure logic locking mechanisms. We formalize, for the first time to our
knowledge, a precise notion of security for logic locking. We establish that
any locking procedure that is secure under our definition is guaranteed to
counter our desynthesis attack, and all other such known attacks. We then
devise a new logic locking procedure, Meerkat, that guarantees that the locked
chip reveals no information about the key or the designer's intended
functionality. A main insight behind Meerkat is that canonical representations
of boolean functionality via Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs)
can be leveraged effectively to provide security. We analyze Meerkat with
regards to its security properties and the overhead it incurs. As such, our
work is a contribution to both the foundations and practice of securing digital
ICs.

matched with some special rings and codes over such rings with specific
properties are studied. However, these matchings in general are not
straightforward and because of the fact that the reverse of the codewords

is referred to as the reversibility problem. Here, 8-mers (DNA 8-bases) are
matched with the ring elements of $R_{16}=F_{16}+uF_{16}+vF_{16}+uvF_{16}.$
Furthermore, cyclic codes over the ring $R_{16}$ where the multiplication is

galaxies have compact dusty star-forming cores with effective radii of Re=1.3
kpc and Re=1.2 kpc in the 870 um continuum emission. The spatial extent of
star-forming molecular gas is also compact with Re=1.9 kpc and Re=2.3 kpc, but
more extended than the dust emission. Interpreting the observed
position-velocity diagrams with dynamical models, we find the starburst cores
to be rotation-dominated with the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to the
local velocity dispersion of v/sigma=7.0 (v=386 km/s) and v/sigma_0=4.1 (v=391
km/s). Given that the descendants of these massive galaxies in the local
universe are likely ellipticals with v/sigma nearly an order of magnitude
lower, the rapidly rotating galaxies would lose significant net angular
momentum in the intervening time. The comparisons among dynamical, stellar,
gas, and dust mass suggest that the starburst CO-to-H2 conversion factor of
alpha_CO=0.8 Msun/(K km/s/pc2) is appropriate in the spatially resolved cores.
The dense cores are likely to be formed in extreme environments similar to the
central regions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Our work also
demonstrates that a combination of medium-resolution CO and high-resolution
dust continuum observations is a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamical

inter-dependency of the transmit relay power on each antenna and the residual
self-interference in an FD-AF relay, we observe a distortion loop that degrades
the system performance when the relay dynamic range is not high. In this
regard, we analyze the relay function in presence of the hardware inaccuracies
and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the signal to
distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR), under relay and source transmit power
constraints. Due to the problem complexity, we propose a
gradient-projection-based (GP) algorithm to obtain an optimal solution.
Moreover, a nonalternating sub-optimal solution is proposed by assuming a
rank-1 relay amplification matrix, and separating the design of the relay
process into multiple stages (MuStR1). The proposed MuStR1 method is then
enhanced by introducing an alternating update over the optimization variables,
denoted as AltMuStR1 algorithm. It is observed that compared to GP, (Alt)MuStR1
algorithms significantly reduce the required computational complexity at the
expense of a slight performance degradation. Finally, the proposed methods are
evaluated under various system conditions, and compared with the methods
available in the current literature. In particular, it is observed that as the
hardware impairments increase, or for a system with a high transmit power, the

individual cost function. The cost functions of different agents are coupled
through a mean-field term that depends on the mean of the population states. We
show that although the mean-field game is not a potential game, under some mild

the optimal solution to a social welfare optimization problem, and this is true
even when the individual cost functions are non-convex. The connection enables
us to evaluate and promote the efficiency of the mean-field equilibrium. In

frequency stabilization in AC islanded microgrids. In the primary control
layer, each generation unit is equipped with a local controller acting on the
corresponding voltage-source converter. Following the plug-and-play design
approach previously proposed by some of the authors, whenever the
addition/removal of a distributed generation unit is required, feasibility of
the operation is automatically checked by designing local controllers through
convex optimization. The update of the voltage-control layer, when units plug
-in/-out, is therefore automatized and stability of the microgrid is always
preserved. Moreover, local control design is based only on the knowledge of
parameters of power lines and it does not require to store a global microgrid
model. In this work, we focus on bus-connected microgrid topologies and enhance
the primary plug-and-play layer with local virtual impedance loops and
secondary coordinated controllers ensuring bus voltage tracking and reactive
power sharing. In particular, the secondary control architecture is
distributed, hence mirroring the modularity of the primary control layer. We
validate primary and secondary controllers by performing experiments with
balanced, unbalanced and nonlinear loads, on a setup composed of three
bus-connected distributed generation units. Most importantly, the stability of
the microgrid after the addition/removal of distributed generation units is
assessed. Overall, the experimental results show the feasibility of the
proposed modular control design framework, where generation units can be
added/removed on the fly, thus enabling the deployment of virtual power plants

formation, with important implications for both the physical and chemical
evolution of young stellar objects. In particular, very little is known about
the accretion variability in the earliest stages of star formation.
  Aims: To characterise protostellar accretion histories towards individual
sources by utilising sublimation and freeze-out chemistry of CO.
  Methods: A sample of 24 embedded protostars are observed with the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) in context of the large program ""Mass Assembly of
Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA"" (MASSES). The size of the
C$^{18}$O emitting region, where CO has sublimated into the gas-phase, is
measured towards each source and compared to the expected size of the region
given the current luminosity. The SMA observations also include 1.3 mm
continuum data, which are used to investigate whether a link can be established
between accretion bursts and massive circumstellar disks.
  Results: Depending on the adopted sublimation temperature of the CO ice,
between 20% and 50% of the sources in the sample show extended C$^{18}$O
emission indicating that the gas was warm enough in the past that CO sublimated
and is currently in the process of refreezing; something which we attribute to
a recent accretion burst. Given the fraction of sources with extended C$^{18}$O
emission, we estimate an average interval between bursts of 20000-50000 yr,
which is consistent with previous estimates. No clear link can be established
between the presence of circumstellar disks and accretion bursts, however the
three closest known binaries in the sample (projected separations <20 AU) all
show evidence of a past accretion burst, indicating that close binary
interactions may also play a role in inducing accretion variability.

for gravitational wave experiments. They also provide insights on close binary

spatially resolved but indirect methods can identify candidates. In 2015 Liu et
al. reported an optical-continuum periodicity in the quasar PSO
J334.2028+01.4075, with the estimated mass and rest-frame period suggesting an
orbital separation of about 0.006 pc (0.7 micro-arcsec). The persistence of the
quasar's optical periodicity has recently been disfavored over an extended
baseline. However, if a radio jet is launched from a sub-parsec BBH, the
binary's properties can influence the radio structure on larger scales. Here,
we use the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) to study the parsec- and kiloparsec-scale emission energized by the
quasar's putative BBH. We find two VLBA components separated by 3.6 mas (30
pc), tentatively identifying one as the VLBA ""core"" from which the other was
ejected. The VLBA components contribute to a point-like, time-variable VLA
source that is straddled by lobes spanning 8 arcsec (66 kpc). We classify PSO
J334.2028+01.4075 as a lobe-dominated quasar, albeit with an atypically large
twist of 39 deg between its elongation position angles on parsec- and
kiloparsec-scales. By analogy with 3C 207, a well-studied lobe-dominated quasar
with a similarly-rare twist, we speculate that PSO J334.2028+01.4075 could be
ejecting jet components over an inner cone that traces a precessing jet in a

member of the Praesepe open cluster that we interpret as a Neptune-sized
transiting planet. The star is JS 183 (HSHJ 163, EPIC 211916756) with $T_{\rm
eff} = 3325\pm100$ K, $M_{*} = 0.44\pm0.04$ $M_{\odot}$, $R_{*} = 0.44\pm0.03$
$R_{\odot}$, and $\log{g_*} = 4.82\pm0.06$. The planet has an orbital period of
10.134588 days and a radius of $R_{P}= 0.32\pm0.02$ $R_J$. Since the star is
faint at $V=16.5$ and $J=13.3$, we are unable to obtain a measured
radial-velocity orbit, but we can constrain the companion mass to below about
1.7 $M_J$, and thus well below the planetary boundary. JS 183b (since
designated as K2-95b) is the second transiting planet found with ${\it K2}$
that resides in a several hundred Myr open cluster; both planets orbit mid-M
dwarf stars and are approximately Neptune-sized. With a well-determined stellar
density from the planetary transit, and with an independently known metallicity
from its cluster membership, JS 183 provides a particularly valuable test of
stellar models at the fully convective boundary. We find that JS 183 is the
lowest-density transit host known at the fully convective boundary, and that
its very low density is consistent with current models of stars just above the
fully convective boundary but in tension with the models just below the fully
convective boundary.

inverse problem in the context of general rough sets that concerns the
existence of rough basis for given approximations in a context. Granular
operator spaces and variants were recently introduced by the present author as
an optimal framework for anti-chain based algebraic semantics of general rough
sets and the inverse problem. In the framework, various sub-types of crisp and
non-crisp objects are identifiable that may be missed in more restrictive
formalism. This is also because in the latter cases concepts of complementation
and negation are taken for granted - while in reality they have a complicated
dialectical basis. This motivates a general approach to dialectical rough sets
building on previous work of the present author and figures of opposition. In
this paper dialectical rough logics are invented from a semantic perspective, a
concept of dialectical predicates is formalised, connection with dialetheias
and glutty negation are established, parthood analyzed and studied from the
viewpoint of classical and dialectical figures of opposition by the present
author. Her methods become more geometrical and encompass parthood as a primary
relation (as opposed to roughly equivalent objects) for algebraic semantics.

a model of the deformable object. To ""pull"" an arm and evaluate its utility, we
use the arm's model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding
the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the
utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and
balances exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models.
We also propose an approach based on Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary
Multi-armed Normal Bandits (KF-MANB) to leverage the coupling between models to
learn more from each arm pull. We demonstrate that our method outperforms
previous methods on synthetic trials, and performs competitively on several
manipulation tasks in simulation.

the host galaxies, with spatial extents of 2.5 to 11.0 kpc. Outflows are
detected uniformly across the star-forming main sequence, showing little trend
with the host galaxy SFR. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that the outflowing

is insufficient to drive at least some of these outflows, they are very likely
to be AGN-driven. The outflows have mass-loading factors of the order of unity,

random walkers (RWs) on directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) networks. Starting from
a random initial node, a random walker hops randomly along directed edges
between adjacent nodes in the network. The path terminates either by the
retracing scenario, when the walker enters a node which it has already visited
before, or by the trapping scenario, when it becomes trapped in a dead-end node
from which it cannot exit. The path length, namely the number of steps, $d$,
pursued by the random walker from the initial node up to its termination, is
called the first hitting time. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical
results for the tail distribution of first hitting times, $P(d>\ell)$. The
distribution $P(d>\ell)$ can be expressed as a product of an exponential
distribution and a Rayleigh distribution. We obtain expressions for the mean,
median and standard deviation of this distribution in terms of the network size
and its mean degree. We also calculate the distribution of last hitting times,
namely the path lengths of self-avoiding walks on directed ER networks, which
do not retrace their paths. The last hitting times are found to be much longer
than the first hitting times. The results are compared to those obtained for
undirected ER networks. It is found that the first hitting times of RWs in a
directed ER network are much longer than in the corresponding undirected
network. This is due to the fact that RWs on directed networks do not exhibit
the backtracking scenario, which is a dominant termination mechanism of RWs on
undirected networks. It is shown that our approach also applies to a broader
class of networks, referred to as semi-ER networks, in which the distribution
of in-degrees is Poisson, while the out-degrees may follow any desired
distribution with the same mean as the in-degree distribution.

of 100 m/s in the cloud deck, and large-scale intrinsic magnetic fields on the
order of 1 Gauss near the surface. The vertical structure of the zonal flows
remains obscure. The end-member scenarios are shallow flows confined in the
radiative atmosphere and deep flows throughout the entire planet. The
electrical conductivity increases rapidly yet smoothly as a function of depth
inside Jupiter and Saturn. Deep zonal flows will inevitably interact with the
magnetic field, at depth with even modest electrical conductivity. Here we
investigate the interaction between zonal flows and magnetic fields in the
semi-conducting region of giant planets. Employing mean-field electrodynamics,
we show that the interaction will generate detectable poloidal magnetic field
perturbations spatially correlated with the deep zonal flows. Assuming the peak
amplitude of the dynamo alpha-effect to be 0.1 mm/s, deep zonal flows on the
order of 0.1 - 1 m/s in the semi-conducting region of Jupiter and Saturn would
generate poloidal magnetic perturbations on the order of 0.01% - 1% of the
background dipole field. These poloidal perturbations should be detectable with
the in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Juno mission and the Cassini
Grand Finale. This implies that magnetic field measurements can be employed to
constrain the properties of deep zonal flows in the semi-conducting region of

ranges, and use $N$-body simulations to study their long-term dynamical
evolution in isolation as well as the formation of bar in them. We find that
dwarf disk galaxies readily form bars unless they have an excessively
concentrated halo or a hot disk. This suggests that infalling dwarf disk
galaxies are intrinsically unstable to bar formation, even without any external
perturbation, accounting for a population of barred dwarf galaxies in the
outskirts of the Virgo cluster. The bars form earlier and stronger in galaxies
with a lower fraction of counter-streaming motions, lower halo concentration,
lower velocity anisotropy, and thinner disk. Similarly to normal disk galaxies,
dwarf disk galaxies also undergo recurrent buckling instabilities. The first
buckling instability tends to shorten the bar and to thicken the disk, and
drives a dynamical transition in the bar pattern speed as well as mass inflow
rate. In nine models, the bars regrow after the mild first buckling instability
due to the efficient transfer of disk angular momentum to the halo, and are
subject to recurrent buckling instabilities to turn into X-shaped bulges.

because of its outstanding device based performance as a light-harvesting
semiconductor. Whereas the experimental and theoretical studies of this system
in the solid state have been numerously reported in the last 4 years, its
fundamental cluster physics is yet to be exploited. To this end, this study has
performed theoretical investigations using DFT-M06-2X/ADZP to examine the
principal geometrical, electronic, topological, and orbital properties of the
CH3NH3PbI3 nanocluster blocks. These clusters are found to be unusually
strongly bound, with binding energies lying between 93.53 and 125.11 kcal mol-1
(beyond the covalent limit, 40 kcal mol-1), enabling us to characterize the
underlying interactions as ultra-strong type. Based on this, together with the
unusually high charge transfers, strong hyperconjugative interactions,
sophisticated topologies of the charge density, and short intermolecular
distances uncovered, we have characterized the CH3NH3PbI3 as Mulliken inner

in the context of a phenomenological model with a massive gluon. Second, the

with realistic equations of state and opacities, we explored the outcome of
self-gravity at 50 AU in a protoplanetary disc irradiated by the central star.
We found that gravito-turbulence is sustained for a finite range of the surface
density, from $\sim 80$ to $\sim$ 250 gcm$^{-2}$. The disk is laminar below the
range while fragments above it. In the range of gravito-turbulence, the Toomre
parameter decreases monotonically from $\sim 1$ to $\sim 0.7$ as the surface
density increases while an effective cooling time is almost constant at $\sim
4$ in terms of the inverse of the orbital frequency. The turbulent motions are
supersonic at all heights, which dissipates through both shock waves and
compressional heating. The compressional motions, occurring near the midplane,
create upward flows, which not only contribute to supporting the disc but also
to transporting the dissipated energy to the disc surfaces. The irradiation
does not affect much the gravito-turbulence near the midplane unless the
grazing angle is larger than 0.32. We also show that a simple cooling function
with a constant cooling time does not approximate the realistic cooling.

  Williams","Preserving Distances in Very Faulty Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Preservers and additive spanners are sparse (hence cheap to store) subgraphs
that preserve the distances between given pairs of nodes exactly or with some
small additive error, respectively. Since real-world networks are prone to
failures, it makes sense to study fault-tolerant versions of the above
structures. This turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task. For every small
but arbitrary set of edge or vertex failures, the preservers and spanners need
to contain {\em replacement paths} around the faulted set. In this paper we
make substantial progress on fault tolerant preservers and additive spanners:
  (1) We present the first truly sub-quadratic size single-pair preservers in
unweighted (possibly directed) graphs for \emph{any} fixed number $f$ of
faults. Our result indeed generalizes to the single-source case, and can be
used to build new fault-tolerant additive spanners (for all pairs).
  (2) The size of the above single-pair preservers is $O(n^{2-g(f)})$ for some
positive function $g$, and grows to $O(n^2)$ for increasing $f$. We show that
this is necessary even in undirected unweighted graphs, and even if you allow
for a small additive error: If you aim at size $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ for
$\epsilon>0$, then the additive error has to be $\Omega(\eps f)$. This
surprisingly matches known upper bounds in the literature.
  (3) For weighted graphs, we provide matching upper and lower bounds for the
single pair case. Namely, the size of the preserver is $\Theta(n^2)$ for $f\geq
2$ in both directed and undirected graphs, while for $f=1$ the size is
$\Theta(n)$ in undirected graphs. For directed graphs, we have a superlinear
upper bound and a matching lower bound.
  Most of our lower bounds extend to the distance oracle setting, where rather
than a subgraph we ask for any compact data structure.

Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.900 (Release 14) RMa path loss models adopted
from the International Telecommunications Union - Radiocommunications (ITU-R)
Sector. This paper shows how the 3GPP RMa large-scale path loss models were
derived for frequencies below 6 GHz, yet they are being asserted for use up to
30 GHz, even though there has not been sufficient work or published data to
support their validity at frequencies above 6 GHz or in the mmWave bands. We
present the background of the 3GPP RMa path loss models and their use of odd
correction factors not suitable for rural scenarios, and show that the
multi-frequency close-in free space reference distance (CI) path loss model is
more accurate and reliable than current 3GPP and ITU-R RMa models. Using field
data and simulations, we introduce a new close-in free space reference distance
with height dependent path loss exponent model (CIH), that predicts rural
macrocell path loss using an effective path loss exponent that is a function of
base station antenna height. This work shows the CI and CIH models can be used
from 500 MHz to 100 GHz for rural mmWave coverage and interference analysis,
without any discontinuity at 6 GHz as exists in today's 3GPP and ITU-R RMa

suitable for future spintronic and topological applications. Recent studies
confirmed the room-temperature stabilization of skyrmions in ultrathin
ferromagnets. However, such ferromagnetic skyrmions show undesirable
topological effect, the skyrmion Hall effect, which leads to their
current-driven motion towards device edges, where skyrmions could easily be
annihilated by topographic defects. Recent theoretical studies have predicted
enhanced current-driven behaviour for antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled
skyrmions. Here we present the stabilization of these skyrmions and their
current-driven dynamics in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo films. By utilizing
element-specific X-ray imaging, we find that the skyrmions in the Gd and FeCo
sublayers are antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled. We further confirm that
ferrimagnetic skyrmions can move at a velocity of ~50 m s-1 with reduced
skyrmion Hall angle, {\theta}SkHE ~20{\deg}. Our findings open the door to
ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic skyrmionics while providing key
experimental evidences of recent theoretical studies.

ages between 10-300 Myr observed by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
(PHAT) survey in M31. The data show clear evidence of a high-mass truncation:
only 15 clusters more massive than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ are observed, compared to
$\sim$100 expected for a canonical $M^{-2}$ pure power-law mass function with
the same total number of clusters above the catalog completeness limit.
Adopting a Schechter function parameterization, we fit a characteristic
truncation mass of $M_c = 8.5^{+2.8}_{-1.8} \times 10^3$ $M_{\odot}$. While
previous studies have measured cluster mass function truncations, the
characteristic truncation mass we measure is the lowest ever reported.
Combining this M31 measurement with previous results, we find that the cluster
mass function truncation correlates strongly with the characteristic star
formation rate surface density of the host galaxy, where $M_c \propto$ $\langle
\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}} \rangle^{\sim1.1}$. We also find evidence that suggests
the observed $M_c$-$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ relation also applies to globular
clusters, linking the two populations via a common formation pathway. If so,
globular cluster mass functions could be useful tools for constraining the star
formation properties of their progenitor host galaxies in the early Universe.

shape and stability of a thin viscous sheet that is inhomogeneously stretched
in an imposed non-uniform temperature field. We first determine the associated
base flow by solving the long-timescale stretching flow of a flat sheet as a
function of two dimensionless parameters: the normalized stretching velocity
$\alpha$, and a dimensionless width of the heating zone $\beta$. This allows us
to determine the conditions for the onset of an out-of-plane wrinkling
instability stated in terms of an eigenvalue problem for a linear partial
differential equation governing the displacement of the midsurface of the
sheet. We show the sheet can become unstable in two regions that are upstream
and downstream of the heating zone where the minimum in-plane stress is
negative. This yields the shape and growth rates of the most unstable buckling
mode in both regions for various values of the stretching velocity and heating
zone width. A transition from stationary to oscillatory unstable modes is found
in the upstream region with increasing $\beta$ while the downstream region is
always stationary. We show that the wrinkling instability can be entirely
suppressed when the surface tension is large enough relative to the magnitude
of the in-plane stress. Finally, we present an operating diagram that indicates
regions of the parameter space that result in a required outlet sheet thickness
upon stretching, while simultaneously minimizing or suppressing the
out-of-plane buckling; a result that is relevant for the glass redraw method
used to create ultrathin glass sheets.

efficient resource sharing decisions at market equilibrium. Our results include

widespread availability of miniaturized sensors and internet-connected things
(IoT), security of electronic devices has become a top priority. Side-channel
attack (SCA) is one of the prominent methods to break the security of an
encryption system by exploiting the information leaked from the physical
devices. Correlational power attack (CPA) is an efficient power side-channel
attack technique, which analyses the correlation between the estimated and
measured supply current traces to extract the secret key. The existing
countermeasures to the power attacks are mainly based on reducing the SNR of
the leaked data, or introducing large overhead using techniques like power
balancing. This paper presents an attenuated signature AES (AS-AES), which
resists SCA with minimal noise current overhead. AS-AES uses a shunt
low-drop-out (LDO) regulator to suppress the AES current signature by 400x in
the supply current traces. The shunt LDO has been fabricated and validated in
130 nm CMOS technology. System-level implementation of the AS-AES along with
noise injection, shows that the system remains secure even after 50K
encryptions, with 10x reduction in power overhead compared to that of noise
addition alone.

of in-situ dust-producing planetesmial belt(s) is the most likely source of the

  Static contract simplification attacks this issue using program
transformation. It applies compile-time transformations to programs with
contracts to reduce the overall run time while preserving the original

obtain residual contracts that are collectively cheaper to check at run time.
We distinguish different levels of preservation of behavior, which impose
different limitations on the admissible transformations: Strong blame

find that period changes are often non-linear, sometimes cyclic, suggesting
physical origins beyond secular evolution. Our method more efficiently detects

patterns on flat terrains, the trajectories in the task space are planned to
satisfy the dynamic balance and slippage avoidance constraints, and also to
guarantee smooth landing of the swing foot. To ensure smooth landing of the
swing foot on surfaces with height uncertainty, the preplanned trajectories in
the task space should be adapted. The proposed adaptation algorithm consists of
two stages. In the first stage, once the swing foot reaches its maximum height,
the supervisory control is initiated until the touch is detected. After the
detection, the trajectories in the task space are modified to guarantee smooth
landing. In the second stage, this modification is preserved during the Double
Support Phase (DSP), and released in the next Single Support Phase (SSP).
Effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation algorithm is experimentally
verified through realization of the walking patterns on the SURENA III humanoid
robot, designed and fabricated at CAST. The walking is tested on a surface with
various flat obstacles, where the swing foot is prone to either land on the
ground soon or late.

learning community. However, the proper evaluation of new AC procedures is
hindered by two key hurdles. First, AC benchmarks are hard to set up. Second
and even more significantly, they are computationally expensive: a single run
of an AC procedure involves many costly runs of the target algorithm whose
performance is to be optimized in a given AC benchmark scenario. One common
workaround is to optimize cheap-to-evaluate artificial benchmark functions
(e.g., Branin) instead of actual algorithms; however, these have different
properties than realistic AC problems. Here, we propose an alternative
benchmarking approach that is similarly cheap to evaluate but much closer to
the original AC problem: replacing expensive benchmarks by surrogate benchmarks
constructed from AC benchmarks. These surrogate benchmarks approximate the
response surface corresponding to true target algorithm performance using a
regression model, and the original and surrogate benchmark share the same
(hyper-)parameter space. In our experiments, we construct and evaluate
surrogate benchmarks for hyperparameter optimization as well as for AC problems
that involve performance optimization of solvers for hard combinatorial
problems, drawing training data from the runs of existing AC procedures. We
show that our surrogate benchmarks capture overall important characteristics of
the AC scenarios, such as high- and low-performing regions, from which they
were derived, while being much easier to use and orders of magnitude cheaper to

of configurational transitions when the DNA is in double stranded form. In a
previous work of two of the authors the generalized Poland-Scheraga model has
been analyzed thanks to a representation in terms of a bivariate renewal
process. In this work we exploit this representation farther and fully
characterize the path properties of the system, making therefore explicit the
geometric structures -- and the configurational transitions -- that are
observed when the polymer is in the double stranded form. What we prove is
that, when the excess of bases is not absorbed in a homogeneous fashion along

smoothed sums, including $\sum P_k(n)^2 e^{-n/X}$ and the Laplace transform
$\int_0^\infty P_k(t)^2 e^{-t/X}dt$, in dimensions $k \geq 3$. We also obtain
main terms and power-saving error terms for the sharp sums $\sum_{n \leq X}
P_k(n)^2$, along with similar results for the sharp integral $\int_0^X P_3(t)^2

noncommuting one-qubit holonomic gates, rotating along $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{z}$

a first, offline preprocessing step, we cluster entities based on the
\emph{x--means} and \emph{spectral} clustering algorithms. In the second step,
we propose an optimized retrieval model which takes advantage of our
precomputed clusters. For a given set of entities retrieved by the BM25F
retrieval approach and a given user query, we further expand the result set
with relevant entities by considering features of the queries, entities and the
precomputed clusters. Finally, we re-rank the expanded result set with respect
to the relevance to the query. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on
the Billions Triple Challenge (BTC12) dataset. The proposed approach shows
significant improvements compared to the baseline and state of the art

We investigate the complexity of querying text by Conjunctive Queries (CQs) and

of hardness is that it may be intractable to instantiate the relation defined
by a regex formula, simply because it has an exponential number of tuples. Yet,
we are able to establish general upper bounds. In particular, UCQs can be
evaluated with polynomial delay, provided that every CQ has a bounded number of

evaluation is solvable with FPT (Fixed-Parameter Tractable) delay when the

mysterious phenomena in condensed matter. So far this problem has attracted
attention mainly from the purely scientific viewpoint. Here we report the first
experimental study on an impact of surface nano-structuring on LLT by using a
surface treatment called rubbing, which is the key technology for the
production of liquid crystal displays. We find that such a rubbing treatment
has a significant impact on the kinetics of liquid-liquid transition (LLT) of
an isotropic molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite. For a liquid confined
between rubbed surfaces, surface-induced barrier-less formation of the liquid
II phase is observed even in a metastable state, where there should be a
barrier for nucleation of the liquid II phase in bulk. Thus, surface rubbing of
substrates not only changes the ordering behavior, but also accelerates the
kinetics significantly. This spatio-temporal pattern modulation of LLT can be
explained by a wedge filling transition and the resulting drastic reduction of
the nucleation barrier. However, this effect completely disappears in the
unstable (spinodal) regime, indicating the absence of the activation barrier
even for bulk LLT. This confirms the presence of nucleation-growth-type and
spinodal-decomposition-type LLT, supporting that LLT is truly a first-order
transition with criticality. Our finding also opens up a new way to control the
kinetics of LLT of a liquid confined in a solid cell by structuring its surface
on a mesoscopic lengthscale, which may contribute to making LLT useful for
micro-fluidics and other industrial applications.

Carlo (MCMC) relies on sampling a discrete indexing variable to estimate the
posterior model probabilities. However, little attention has been paid to the
precision of these estimates. If only few switches occur between the models in
the transdimensional MCMC output, precision may be low and assessment based on
the assumption of independent samples misleading. Here, we propose a new method
to estimate the precision based on the observed transition matrix of the
model-indexing variable. Assuming a first order Markov model, the method
samples from the posterior of the stationary distribution. This allows
assessment of the uncertainty in the estimated posterior model probabilities,
model ranks, and Bayes factors. Moreover, the method provides an estimate for
the effective sample size of the MCMC output. In two model-selection examples,
we show that the proposed approach provides a good assessment of the

long-range correlated disorder through exact enumeration of random walks. The
disordered medium is modelled by percolation clusters with correlations
decaying with the distance as a power law, $r^{-a}$, generated with the
improved Fourier filtering method. To characterize this type of disorder, we
determine the percolation threshold $p_{\text c}$ by investigating
cluster-wrapping probabilities. At $p_{\text c}$, we estimate the
(sub-diffusive) walk dimension $d_{\text w}$ for different correlation
exponents $a$. Above $p_{\text c}$, our results suggest a normal random walk
behavior for weak correlations, whereas anomalous diffusion cannot be ruled out
in the strongly correlated case, i.e., for small $a$.

find that the Unitary gauge is consistent and equivalent to the $R_\xi$ gauge
at the level of $\beta$-functions. Then we compare the renormalized, finite,
one-loop Higgs potential in the two gauges and we again find equivalence. This
equivalence needs not only a complete cancellation of the gauge fixing
parameter $\xi$ from the $R_\xi$ gauge potential but also requires its
$\xi$-independent part to be equal to the Unitary gauge result. We follow the
quantum behaviour of the system by plotting Renormalization Group trajectories
and Lines of Constant Physics, with the former the well known curves and with
the latter, determined by the finite parts of the counter-terms, particularly
well suited for a comparison with non-perturbative studies.

characterized by sharply decreasing speed, abruptly increasing density and in
particular suddenly plummeting capacity. In order to clarify its root
mechanisms and model its observed properties, this paper proposes a
car-following model based on the following assumptions: (i) There exists a
preferred time-varied and speed-dependent space gap that cars hope to maintain;
(ii) there exists a region R restricted by two critical space gaps and two
critical speeds in the car following region on the speed-space gap diagram, in
which cars' movements are determined by the weighted mean of the space-
gap-determined acceleration and the speed-difference-determined acceleration;
and (iii) out of region R, cars either accelerate to the free flow speed or
decelerate to keep safety. Simulation results show that this model is able to
simultaneously reproduce traffic breakdown and the transition from the
synchronized traffic flow to wide moving jams. To our knowledge, this is the
first car-following model that is able to fully depict traffic breakdown,
spontaneous formation of jams, and the concave growth of the oscillations.

$C_{2k}$) in an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges for constant
$k\ge2$. A classic result by Bondy and Simonovits [J.Comb.Th.'74] implies that
if $m \ge100k n^{1+1/k}$, then $G$ contains a $C_{2k}$, further implying that
one needs to consider only graphs with $m = O(n^{1+1/k})$.
  Previously the best known algorithms were an $O(n^2)$ algorithm due to Yuster
and Zwick [J.Disc.Math'97] as well as a $O(m^{2-(1+\lceil
k/2\rceil^{-1})/(k+1)})$ algorithm by Alon et al. [Algorithmica'97].
  We present an algorithm that uses $O(m^{2k/(k+1)})$ time and finds a $C_{2k}$
if one exists. This bound is $O(n^2)$ exactly when $m=\Theta(n^{1+1/k})$. For
$4$-cycles our new bound coincides with Alon et al., while for every $k>2$ our
bound yields a polynomial improvement in $m$.
  Yuster and Zwick noted that it is ""plausible to conjecture that $O(n^2)$ is
the best possible bound in terms of $n$"". We show ""conditional optimality"": if
this hypothesis holds then our $O(m^{2k/(k+1)})$ algorithm is tight as well.
Furthermore, a folklore reduction implies that no combinatorial algorithm can
determine if a graph contains a $6$-cycle in time $O(m^{3/2-\epsilon})$ for any
$\epsilon>0$ under the widely believed combinatorial BMM conjecture. Coupled
with our main result, this gives tight bounds for finding $6$-cycles
combinatorially and also separates the complexity of finding $4$- and
$6$-cycles giving evidence that the exponent of $m$ in the running time should
indeed increase with $k$.
  The key ingredient in our algorithm is a new notion of capped $k$-walks,
which are walks of length $k$ that visit only nodes according to a fixed
ordering. Our main technical contribution is an involved analysis proving
several properties of such walks which may be of independent interest.

the latent series. Several methods for accomplishing this exist and three
particular ones are the classic SOBI and the recently proposed generalized FOBI

moments. In this paper we generalize the methodologies behind these algorithms
for tensor-valued time series. We assume that our data consists of a tensor
observed at each time point and that the observations are linear
transformations of latent tensors we wish to estimate. The tensorial
generalizations are shown to have particularly elegant forms and we show that
each of them is Fisher consistent and orthogonal equivariant. Comparing the new
methods with the original ones in various settings shows that the tensorial
extensions are superior to both their vector-valued counterparts and to two
existing tensorial dimension reduction methods for i.i.d. data. Finally,
applications to fMRI-data and video processing show that the methods are
capable of extracting relevant information from noisy high-dimensional data.

location in the disc in which it could occur are still unknown. Although the
effects of grain sizes and growth in discs have been widely studied, a
simultaneous analysis including dust composition is missing. In this work we
present the dynamical evolution and growth of multicomponent dust in a
protoplanetary disc using a 3D, two-fluid (gas+dust) Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that the dust vertical settling is
characterised by two phases: a density-driven phase which leads to a vertical
chemical sorting of dust and a size-driven phase which enhances the amount of
lighter material in the midplane. We also see an efficient radial chemical
sorting of the dust at large scales. We find that dust particles are
aerodynamically sorted in the inner disc. The disc becomes sub-solar in its
Fe/Si ratio on the surface since the early stage of evolution but sub-solar
Fe/Si can be also found in the outer disc-midplane at late stages. Aggregates
in the disc mimic the physical and chemical properties of chondrites,
suggesting that aerodynamical sorting played an important role in determining

swimming close to a planar free-slip surface by means of numerical solu- tions
of the Stokes equations obtained via a Boundary Element Method. Depending on
the initial condition, the swimmer can either escape from the free-slip surface
or collide with the boundary. Interestingly, the mi- croorganism does not
exhibit a stable orbit. Independently of escape or attraction to the interface,
close to a free-slip surface, the swimmer fol- lows a counter-clockwise
trajectory, in agreement with experimental find- ings, [15]. The hydrodynamics
is indeed modified by the free-surface. In fact, when the same swimmer moves
close to a no-slip wall, a set of initial conditions exists which result in
stable orbits. Moreover when moving close to a free-slip or a no-slip boundary
the swimmer assumes a different orientation with respect to its trajectory.
Taken together, these results contribute to shed light on the hydrodynamical
behaviour of microorgan- isms close to liquid-air interfaces which are relevant
for the formation of interfacial biofilms of aerobic bacteria.

State-of-the-art atomistic rare events simulations are applied for overcoming

interconnected surface cavities wetting starts with the formation of a liquid

in the rest of the liquid-vapor interface, which triggers the wetting of the

several pillars at the same time, could not be captured by previous atomistic

hybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We consider a Dirac field coupled to a
spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic cosmology, sourced by a scalar
inflaton, and treat the Dirac field as a perturbation. We describe the
inhomogeneities of this field in terms of creation and annihilation variables,
chosen to admit a unitary evolution if the Dirac fermion were treated as a test
field. Considering instead the full system, we truncate its action at quadratic
perturbative order and construct a canonical formulation. In particular this
implies that, in the global Hamiltonian constraint of the model, the
contribution of the homogeneous sector is corrected with a quadratic
perturbative term. We then adopt the hybrid LQC approach to quantize the full
model, combining the loop representation of the homogeneous geometry with the
Fock quantization of the inhomogeneities. We assume a Born-Oppenheimer ansatz
for physical states and show how to obtain a Schr\""odinger equation for the
quantum evolution of the perturbations, where the role of time is played by the
homogeneous inflaton. We prove that the resulting quantum evolution of the
Dirac field is indeed unitary, despite the fact that the underlying homogeneous
geometry has been quantized as well. Remarkably, in such evolution, the fermion
field couples to an infinite sequence of quantum moments of the homogeneous
geometry. Moreover, the evolved Fock vacuum of our fermion perturbations is
shown to be an exact solution of the Schr\""odinger equation. Finally, we
discuss in detail the quantum backreaction that the fermion field introduces in
the global Hamiltonian constraint. For completeness, our quantum study includes
since the beginning (gauge-invariant) scalar and tensor perturbations, that

micro-patterned superhydrophobic surface described in terms of alternated

the parallel grooves where a large gas cushion forms between fluid and solid
wall, giving rise to slippage at the gas-liquid interface. The potential of the
boundary element method (BEM) in dealing with mixed no-slip/perfect-slip
boundary conditions is exploited to systematically calculate the mobility
tensor for different particle-to-wall relative positions and for different
particle radii. The particle hydrodynamics is characterized by a non trivial
mobility field which presents a distinct near wall behavior where the wall
patterning directly affects the particle motion. In the far field, the effects
of the wall pattern can be accurately represented via an effective description
in terms of a homogeneous wall with a suitably defined apparent slippage. The
trajectory of the sphere under the action of an external force is also
described in some detail. A resonant regime is found when the frequency of the
transversal component of the force matches a characteristic crossing frequency
imposed by the wall pattern. It is found that, under resonance, the particle
undergoes a mean transversal drift. Since the resonance condition depends on
the particle radius the effect can in principle be used to conceive devices for
particle sorting based on superhydrophobic surfaces.

Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Recently, they deduced from this emission a
cosmic-ray (CR) over-density in the region with a local peak toward the
Galactic Center (GC) and proposed a diffusive scenario with a stationary source
at the GC to explain it. However, the high supernovae (SN) rate in the GC must
also create a sustained CR injection in the region via the shocks produced at
the time of their explosion. Considering typical diffusion coefficient close
the interstellar medium (ISM) value yields to a diffuse escape time much lower
than the recurrence time between each SN explosion, showing that a steady state
model will fail to reproduce the data. This work aims to study the impact of
the spatial and temporal distribution of SNs in the CMZ on the VHE emission
morphology and spectrum: we build a 3D model of VHE CR injection and diffusive
propagation with a realistic gas distribution. We show that a peaked gamma-ray
profile towards the GC can be obtained using realistic SN spatial distribution
taking into account the central massive star cluster. We conclude that the
contribution of SNs can not be neglected, in particular at large longitudes,

creating models without predefined scope. With a brushing interface similar to
common sculpting tools, our system silently records and analyzes users'
workflows, and predicts what they might or should do in the future to reduce
input labor or enhance output quality. Users can accept, ignore, or modify the
suggestions and thus maintain full control and individual style. They can also
explicitly select and clone past workflows over output model regions. Our key
idea is to consider how a model is authored via dynamic workflows in addition
to what it is shaped in static geometry, for more accurate analysis of user
intentions and more general synthesis of shape structures. The workflows
contain potential repetitions for analysis and synthesis, including user inputs
(e.g. pen strokes on a pressure sensing tablet), model outputs (e.g. extrusions
on an object surface), and camera viewpoints. We evaluate our method via user
feedbacks and authored models.

an atom or a quantum dot, in a modulated time-dependent environment with a
photonic band gap. An example of such an environment is a dynamical photonic
crystal or any other environment with a bandgap whose properties are modulated
in time, in the effective mass approximation. After introducing our model of
dynamical photonic crystal, we show that it allows new possibilities to control
and tailor the physical features of the emitted radiation, specifically its
frequency spectrum. In the weak coupling limit and in an adiabatic case, we
obtain the emitted spectrum and we show the appearance of two lateral peaks due
to the presence of the modulated environment, separated from the central peak
by the modulation frequency. We show that the two side peaks are not symmetric
in height, and that their height ratio can be exploited to investigate the
density of states of the environment. Our results show that a dynamical
environment can give further possibilities to modify the spontaneous emission
features, such as its spectrum and emission rate, with respect to a static one.
Observability of the phenomena we obtain is discussed, as well as relevance for
tailoring and engineering radiative processes.

collapse. We perform a set of three-dimensional high-resolution numerical
simulations of a turbulent, self-gravitating and magnetized interstellar medium

with star-forming regions. In particular, we focus on the role played by the
magnetic field and the feedback on the galactic vertical structure, the star

distribution of supernovae sufficiently correlated with the dense gas, we find
that supernova explosions can reproduce the observed SFR, particularly if the
magnetic field is on the order of a few $\mu G$. The vertical structure, which
results from a dynamical and an energy equilibrium is well reproduced by a
simple analytical model, which allows us to estimate the coupling between the
gas and the supernovae. We found the coupling to be rather low and on the order
of 1.5$\%$. Strong magnetic fields may help to increase this coupling by a
factor of about 2-3. To characterize the flow we compute the power spectra of
various quantities in 3D but also in 2D in order to account for the

initio or electron density functional calculations are used to evaluate the

regression is used here to reduce significantly the number of energy

using results of previous calculations to construct an approximate energy

  turbulence",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds
number 550, 1000, 1500, are used to analyse the turbulent production, transfer
and dissipation mechanisms in the compound space of scales and wall-distances
by means of the Kolmogorov equation generalized to inhomogeneous anisotropic
flows. Two distinct peaks of scale-energy source are identified. The first
stronger one belongs to the near-wall cycle. Its location in the space of
scales and physical space is found to scale in viscous units while its
intensity grows slowly with $Re$, indicating a near-wall modulation. The second
source peak is found further away from the wall in the putative overlap layer
and it is separated from the near-wall source by a layer of significant
scale-energy sink. The dynamics of the second outer source appears to be
strongly dependent on the Reynolds number. The detailed scale-by-scale analysis
of this source highlights well-defined features that are used to make the
properties of the outer turbulent source independent of Reynolds number and
wall-distance by rescaling the problem. Overall, the present results suggest a
strong connection of the observed outer scale-energy source with the presence
of an outer region of turbulence production whose mechanisms are well separated
from the near-wall region and whose statistical features agree with the
hypothesis of an overlap layer dominated by attached eddies. Inner-outer
interactions between the near-wall and outer source region in terms of
scale-energy fluxes are also analysed. It is conjectured that the near-wall
modulation of the statistics at increasing Reynolds number can be related to a
confinement of the near-wall turbulence production due to the presence of
increasingly large production scales in the outer scale-energy source region.

the main galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We take into account
the classification of voids into two types that resemble different evolutionary
modes: those with a rising integrated density profile (void-in-void mode, or
R-type) and voids with shells (void-in-cloud mode, or S-type). The results show
that voids of the same type have stronger clustering than the full sample. We
use the correlation analysis to define void clumps, associations with at least
two voids separated by a distance of at most the mean void separation. In order
to study the spatial configuration of void clumps, we compute the minimal
spanning tree and analyse their multiplicity, maximum length and elongation
parameter. We further study the dynamics of the smaller sphere that encloses
all the voids in each clump. Although the global densities of void clumps are
different according to their member-void types, the bulk motions of these
spheres are remarkably lower than those of randomly placed spheres with the
same radii distribution. In addition, the coherence of pairwise void motions
does not strongly depend on whether voids belong to the same clump. Void clumps
are useful to analyse the large-scale flows around voids, since voids embedded
in large underdense regions are mostly in the void-in-void regime, were the
expansion of the larger region produces the separation of voids. Similarly,
voids around overdense regions form clumps that are in collapse, as reflected
in the relative velocities of voids that are mostly approaching.

spatially developing turbulent boundary layer up to Re{\theta} = 2500. Two main
features differentiate the behavior of inertial particles in a zero-
pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer from the more commonly studied case
of a parallel channel flow. The first is the variation along the streamwise
direction of the local dimensionless parameters defining the fluid-particle in-
teractions. The second is the coexistence of an irrotational free-stream and a
near-wall rotational turbulent flow. As concerns the first issue, an inner and
an outer Stokes number can be defined using inner and outer flow units. The
inner Stokes number governs the near-wall behavior similarly to the case of
channel flow. To understand the effect of a laminar-turbulent interface, we ex-
amine the behavior of particles initially released in the free stream and show
that they present a distinct behavior with respect to those directly injected
inside the boundary layer. A region of minimum concentration occurs inside the
turbulent boundary layer at about one displacement thickness from the wall. Its
formation is due to the competition between two transport mecha- nisms: a
relatively slow turbulent diffusion towards the buffer layer and a fast
turbophoretic drift towards the wall.

received considerable attention from the mathematics and engineering community
in the last few years. The MHM methods allow solving highly heterogeneous
problems on coarse meshes while providing solutions with high-order precision.
It embeds independent local problems which are responsible for upscaling
unresolved scales into the numerical solution. These local contributions are
brought together through a global problem defined on the skeleton of the coarse
partition. Since the local problems are completely independent, they can be
easily computed in parallel. In this paper, we present two simulator prototypes
specifically crafted for the MHM methods, which adopt two different
implementation strategies: (i) a multi-programming language approach, each
language tackling different simulation issues; and (ii) a classical,
single-programming language approach. Specifically, we use C++ for numerical
computation of the global and local problems in a modular way; for process
distribution in the simulator, we adopt the Erlang concurrent language in the
first approach, and the MPI standard in the second approach. The aim of
exploring these different approaches is twofold: (i) allow for the deployment
of the simulator both in high-performance computing (with MPI) and in cloud
computing environments (with Erlang); and (ii) pave the way for further
exploration of quality attributes related to software productivity and
fault-tolerance, which are key to Exascale systems. We present a performance
evaluation of the two simulator prototypes taking into account their
efficiency.

a single hidden layer to predict Barry Cottonfield's likely reply to this
author's invitation to the ""Once Upon a Daydream"" junior prom at the Conard
High School gymnasium back in 1997. To examine the network's ability to
generalize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2
regularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range
of regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical
decision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently
engaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's
inability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well
documented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple
quadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is
not necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error.
  Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have
received an 87.2 (1)% chance of ""Yes"" given a particular set of environmental
input parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is
found to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild
evidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network
performs comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests
that the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not
affect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output,
implications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and
future directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra
teacher assures us that in Barry's case this is not possible.

diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) to increasingly heavy elements. Although
generally assumed to be small, we find that when using standard techniques the
pseudopotential localization error can be large, on the order of an electron
volt for an isolated cerium atom. We formally show that localization error can
be reduced to zero with improvements to the Jastrow factor alone and we define
a metric of Jastrow sensitivity that may be useful in the design of
pseudopotentials. We employ an extrapolation scheme to extract the bare fixed
node energy and estimate the localization error in both the locality
approximation and the T-moves schemes for the Ce atom in charge states 3+ and
4+. The locality approximation exhibits the lowest Jastrow sensitivity and
generally smaller localization errors than T-moves, although the locality
approximation energy approaches the localization free limit from above/below
for the 3+/4+ charge state. We find that energy minimized Jastrow factors
including three-body electron-electron-ion terms are the most effective at
reducing localization error for both the locality approximation and T-moves.
Less complex or variance minimized Jastrows are generally less effective. Our
results suggest that further improvements to Jastrow factors and trial
wavefunction forms will be necessary to reduce localization errors to chemical
accuracy in calculations of heavy elements.

environmental stimulation such as light. It is of great importance to
characterize the behavioral performance of w1118 flies because this would
provide a baseline from which the effect of the gene of interest could be
differentiated. Little work has been performed to characterize the walking
behavior in adult w1118 flies. Here we show that pulsed light stimulation
increased the regularity of walking trajectories of w1118 flies in circular
arenas. We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and
extracted the walking structures of w1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation
redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures.
Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of crossing over
the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of
mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed
light stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect
of mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic
light stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w1118 flies and
an unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying
w1118 isogenic background.

  In this paper, we propose a new adversarial model that shows how an air
gapped network can receive communications over a covert thermal channel.
Concretely, we show how attackers may use a compromised air-conditioning system
(connected to the internet) to send commands to infected hosts within an
air-gapped network. Since thermal communication protocols are a rather
unexplored domain, we propose a novel line-encoding and protocol suitable for
this type of channel. Moreover, we provide experimental results to demonstrate
the covert channel's feasibility, and to calculate the channel's bandwidth.

stars (HVSs), which are faster than the local escape velocity of the Galaxy and
their slower counterparts, the high-velocity stars in the Galactic halo. Such
HVSs are believed to be ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal
disruption of a binary by the super-massive black hole (Hills mechanism). The
Hyper-MUCHFUSS survey aims at finding high-velocity potentially unbound hot
subdwarf stars. We present the spectroscopic and kinematical analyses of a
He-sdO as well as three candidates among the sdB stars using optical Keck/ESI
and VLT (Xshooter, FORS) spectroscopy. Proper motions are determined by
combining positions from early-epoch photographic plates with those derived
from modern digital sky surveys. The Galactic rest frame velocities range from
203 km\,s$^{-1}$ to 660 km\,s$^{-1}$, indicating that most likely all four
stars are gravitationally bound to the Galaxy. With $T_\text{eff}=47000$ K and
a surface gravity of $\log g = 5.7$, SDSS J205030.39$-$061957.8 (J2050) is a
spectroscopic twin of the hypervelocity He-sdO US 708. As for the latter, the
GC is excluded as a place of origin based on the kinematic analysis. Hence, the
Hills mechanism can be excluded for J2050. The ejection velocity is much more
moderate ($385\pm79$ km\,s$^{-1}$) than that of US 708 ($998\pm68$
km\,s$^{-1}$). The binary thermonuclear supernova scenario suggested for US 708
would explain the observed properties of J2050 very well without pushing the
model parameters to their extreme limits, as required for US 708. Accordingly,
the star would be the surviving donor of a type Ia supernova. Three sdB stars
also showed extreme kinematics; one could be a HVS ejected from the GC, whereas
the other two could be ejected from the Galactic disk through the binary
supernova mechanism. Alternatively, they might be extreme halo stars.

complementarity of CORE with ambitious future ground-based CMB experiments that
could be deployed in the next decade. A possible CORE mission concept with a
150 cm diameter primary mirror can detect of the order of 50,000 clusters
through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE). The total yield increases
(decreases) by 25% when increasing (decreasing) the mirror diameter by 30 cm.
The 150 cm telescope configuration will detect the most massive clusters
($>10^{14}\, M_\odot$) at redshift $z>1.5$ over the whole sky, although the
exact number above this redshift is tied to the uncertain evolution of the
cluster SZE flux-mass relation; assuming self-similar evolution, CORE will
detect $\sim 500$ clusters at redshift $z>1.5$. This changes to 800 (200) when
increasing (decreasing) the mirror size by 30 cm. CORE will be able to measure
individual cluster halo masses through lensing of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies with a 1-$\sigma$ sensitivity of $4\times10^{14}

is an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ whose $(j, k)$ entries are $\exp(2i\pi m X_jY_k)$,
with $X_j$ and $Y_k$ two i.i.d sequences of random variables and $1\leq m\leq
n$ is a real number. When they are uniformly distributed on a symmetric
interval, this may be seen as a random discretization of the Finite Fourier
transform, whose spectrum has been extensively studied in relation with
band-limited functions. Our study is two-fold. Firstly, by pushing forward
concentration inequalities, we find an accurate comparison in $\ell^2$- norm
between the spectrum of $A^*A$ and the one of an integral operator that can be
defined in terms of the two probability laws chosen for the rows and the
columns. Our study includes the one of stationary Hermitian kernel matrices and
can be generalized to non stationary ones, for which the same kind of
comparison with an integral operator is possible. Because of possible
applications in the data science area, these last matrices have been largely
studied in the literature and our results are compared with previous ones.
  Secondly we concentrate on uniform distributions for the laws of $X_j$'s and
$Y_k$'s, for which the integral operator is the well-known Sinc-kernel operator
with parameter $m.$ Our previous study allows to translate to random Fourier
matrices the knowledge that we have on the spectrum of this operator. We have
for them asymptotic results for $m, n$ and $n/m$ tending to $\infty$, as well
as non asymptotic bounds in the spirit of recent work on the integral
operators. As an application, we give fairly good approximations of the number
of degrees of freedom and the capacity of a MIMO wireless communication network
approximation model. Finally, we provide the reader with some numerical
examples that illustrate the theoretical results of this paper.

develops a density gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow and exhibits
solid-like layering near the boundaries. Both the number of solid-like layers

increase with the shear rate. We argue that the inhomogeneous density profile
develops as the consequence of thermophoresis due to the non-uniform
temperature profile produced by shear-induced viscous heating in the simulated

nonlinear velocity profiles, inhomogeneous stress distributions and shear rate
dependent viscosity which exhibits shear thinning followed by shear thickening
as the shear rate is increased. The connection between these phenomena is

fundamental properties of some linear and nonlinear models with PT-symmetric

waves were limited to constant diffraction coefficients in the ambient medium.
Here we address effects of variable diffraction coefficient on the beam
dynamics in nonlinear media with generalized $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Scarf-II
potentials. The broken linear PT symmetry phase may enjoy a restoration with
the growing diffraction parameter. Continuous families of one- and
two-dimensional solitons are found to be stable. Particularly, some stable
solitons are analytically found. The existence range and propagation dynamics
of the solitons are identified. Transformation of the solitons by means of
adiabatically varying parameters, and collisions between solitons are studied
too. We also explore the evolution of constant-intensity waves in a model
combining the variable diffraction coefficient and complex potentials with
globally balanced gain and loss, which are more general than PT-symmetric ones,
but feature similar properties. Our results may suggest new experiments for
PT-symmetric nonlinear waves in nonlinear nonuniform optical media.

humans -- rightfully so -- generate multiple, diverse captions, due to the

brain cancer patients. During treatment, a very high dose of radiation is
delivered to a very narrow area. Prescribed radiation therapy for brain cancer
requires precisely defining the target treatment area, as well as delineating
vital brain structures which must be spared from radiotoxicity. Nevertheless,
delineation task is usually still manually performed, which is inefficient and
operator-dependent. Several attempts of automatizing this process have
reported. however, marginal results when analyzing organs in the optic region.
In this work we present a deep learning classification scheme based on
augmented-enhanced features to automatically segment organs at risk (OARs) in
the optic region -optic nerves, optic chiasm, pituitary gland and pituitary
stalk-. Fifteen MR images with various types of brain tumors were
retrospectively collected to undergo manual and automatic segmentation. Mean
Dice Similarity coefficients around 0.80 were reported. Incorporation of
proposed features yielded to improvements on the segmentation. Compared with
support vector machines, our method achieved better performance with less
variation on the results, as well as a considerably reduction on the
classification time. Performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated
with respect to manual contours. In this case, results obtained from the
automatic contours mostly lie on the variability of the observers, showing no
significant differences with respect to them. These results suggest therefore
that the proposed system is more accurate than other presented approaches, up
to date, to segment these structures. The speed, reproducibility, and
robustness of the process make the proposed deep learning-based classification
system a valuable tool for assisting in the delineation task of small OARs in
brain cancer.

strain and temperature is determined. In particular, we find that the
$xx$-component of the thermopower is strongly enhanced, while the
$yy$-component is strongly reduced, when applying 2% tensile strain. A similar
anisotropy is also found in the power factor. The temperature dependence of the
conductivity in the $a$-$b$ plane is found to be rather weak above 200 K, which
clearly indicates that the experimentally observed transport properties are

the small-signal electrothermal parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and the
superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$. Additionally, we examine the
effects of an applied magnetic field on the device performance. Our model
predicts a decrease in $T_{c}$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as the number of lateral

$L$ of a TES and its critical temperature, $T_{c} \propto L^{-0.7}$ for a
bilayer with normal-metal bars. We predict a periodic magnetic flux dependence
of $\alpha, \beta$ and $I_{c}$. Our results demonstrate good agreement with
published experimental data, which also show the reduction of $\alpha$, $\beta$

Although previous work has argued that charge order within the dimers or
intradimer double exchange plays an important role in determining the magnetic
properties, our results suggest that the dimers are better described as
molecular units due to significant orbital hybridization, resulting in one
spin-1/2 moment distributed equally over the two Ru sites. These molecular
building blocks form a frustrated, quasi-two-dimensional triangular lattice.
Our zero and longitudinal field muSR results indicate that the molecular
moments develop a collective, static magnetic ground state, with oscillations
of the zero field muon spin polarization indicative of long-range magnetic
order in the Lu sample. The static magnetism is much more disordered in the Y

Schwinger proper-time quark propagator in the lowest Landau level to calculate
the one-loop gluon self-energy, which in the sequel gives the the effective
gluon propagator. As an artifact of strong magnetic field approximation
($eB>>T^2$ and $eB>>m^2$), the Debye mass for massless flavors is found to
depend only on the magnetic field which is the dominant scale in comparison to
the scales prevalent in the thermal medium. However, for physical quark masses,
it depends on both magnetic field and temperature in a low temperature and high
magnetic field but the temperature dependence is very meagre and becomes
independent of temperature beyond a certain temperature and magnetic field.
With the above mentioned ingredients, the potential between heavy quark ($Q$)
and anti-quark ($\bar Q$) is obtained in a hot QCD medium in the presence of
strong magnetic field by correcting both short and long range components of the
potential in real-time formalism. It is found that the long range part of the
quarkonium potential is affected much more by magnetic field as compared to the
short range part. This observation facilitates us to estimate the magnetic
field beyond which the potential will be too weak to bind $Q\bar Q$ together.
For example, the $J/\psi$ is dissociated at $eB \sim$ 10 $m_\pi^2$ and
$\Upsilon$ is dissociated at $eB \sim$ 100 $m_\pi^2$ whereas its excited

exponentially embedded family method, termed Bayesian EEF. Unlike many other
Bayesian model selection methods, the Bayesian EEF can use vague proper priors
and improper noninformative priors to be objective in the elicitation of
parameter priors. Moreover, the penalty term of the rule is shown to be the sum
of half of the parameter dimension and the estimated mutual information between
parameter and observed data. This helps to reveal the EEF mechanism in
selecting model orders and may provide new insights into the open problems of
choosing an optimal penalty term for model order selection and choosing a good
prior from information theoretic viewpoints. The important example of linear
model order selection is given to illustrate the algorithms and arguments.
Lastly, the Bayesian EEF that uses Jeffreys prior coincides with the EEF rule
derived by frequentist strategies. This shows another interesting relationship
between the frequentist and Bayesian philosophies for model selection.

converters (VSCs) are widely used in power system stability analysis.
Regardless of how the impedance is modeled, there always exist coupling terms
in the impedance matrix, which makes the system a multi-input- multi-output
(MIMO) system. Some approximation approaches omit the coupling terms so that a
three-phase system can be treated like a single-phase one, and the
impedance-based stability criterion for a single-input-single-output (SISO)
system is applicable. However, such handling may result in analytical errors or
even incorrect conclusions in a mirror frequency coupled system. By introducing
the concept of generalized- impedances, this letter proposes a new stability
criterion based on a virtual SISO system, which can effectively handle the
coupling terms. Further, the effects of the phase-locked-loop (PLL) parameters
on system stability are studied based on the proposed criterion. The
effectiveness of the proposed criterion is verified by a hardware-in-the-loop

identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to
monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides.
Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans
were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, whereas genes for the catabolism of
derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (ii)
Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the
monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of
monosaccharide transporters. (iii) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes
may be involved in exchange pathways for the monosaccharides derived from
cleaved mucin glycans. (iv) The analyzed genomes demonstrated different
abilities to degrade known mucin glycans. Generally, the ability to degrade at
least one type of mucin glycan was predicted for 81% of the analyzed genomes.
(v) Eighty-two percent of the analyzed genomes can form mutualistic pairs that
are able to degrade mucin glycans and are not degradable by any of the paired
organisms alone. Taken together, these findings provide further insight into
the inter-microbial communications of the HGM as well as into host-HGM

converges to zero exponentially. The reversibility of the dynamics implies that
the entropy density of the microstates is conserved in the time evolution.
Still, it appears as if equilibrium, with a higher entropy density is
approached. In order to understand this process, we solve the dynamics by
formally proving how the information-theoretic characteristics of the
microstates develop over time. With this approach we can show that an estimate
of the entropy density based on finite length statistics within microstates
converges to the equilibrium entropy density. The process behind this apparent
entropy increase is a dissipation of correlation information over increasing
distances. It is shown that the average information-theoretic correlation
length increases linearly in time, being equivalent to a corresponding increase
in excess entropy.

the wavelength of light) and diffraction-free propagation. The small cross
section of the transverse field allows probing of linear and non-linear
spectroscopic features of atoms with exquisitely low power. The cooperativity
-- the figure of merit in many quantum optics and quantum information systems

inter-atomic coupling through the tightly-confined modes, which opens the
possibility of one-dimensional many-body physics and interesting quantum
interconnection applications. The presence of the ONF modifies the vacuum
field, affecting the spontaneous emission rates of atoms in its vicinity. The
high gradients in the radial intensity naturally provide the potential for
trapping atoms around the ONF, allowing the creation of one-dimensional arrays
of atoms. The same radial gradient in the transverse direction of the field is

variety of platforms and proposed for others, but larger search spaces have
only been demonstrated on a non-scalable NMR system. Here, we report results
for a complete three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the scalable quantum
computing technology of trapped atomic ions, with better-than-classical
performance. The algorithm is performed for all 8 possible single-result
oracles and all 28 possible two-result oracles. Two methods of state marking
are used for the oracles: a phase-flip method employed by other experimental
demonstrations, and a Boolean method requiring an ancilla qubit that is
directly equivalent to the state-marking scheme required to perform a classical
search. All quantum solutions are shown to outperform their classical
counterparts. We also report the first implementation of a Toffoli-4 gate,
which is used along with Toffoli-3 gates to construct the algorithms; these

measured for standard packing and a considerably larger upper angle. The change
in slope appears at the boundary between a densely packed stagnant region at
the periphery and the central flowing channel formed over the aperture. Since
the material in the latter zone is always fluidized, the flow rate is
unaffected by the initial packing of the bed. On the other hand, the contrast

arises, powered by residual H burning on the surface of the white dwarf. While
the general picture of the nova event is well established, the details and
balance of accretion and ejection processes in classical novae are still full

for massive accreting white dwarfs, which may be promising supernova Ia

supersoft X-ray source by XMM-Newton 610~days after outburst. The light curve
showed a periodicity consistent with the orbital period. During one third of
the orbit the luminosity was a factor of seven brighter than during the other
two thirds of the orbital period. In the present work we aim to disentangle the
X-ray spectral components of V5116 Sgr and their variability. We present the
high resolution spectra obtained with XMM-Newton RGS and Chandra LETGS/HRC-S in

VI and N VII. During the low-flux periods, the spectrum is dominated by an
atmosphere with the same temperature as during the high-flux period, but with
several emission features superimposed. Some of the emission lines are well
modeled with an optically thin plasma in collisional equilibrium, rich in C and
N, which also explains some excess in the spectra of the high-flux period. No
velocity shifts are observed in the absorption lines, with an upper limit set
by the spectral resolution of 500 km/s, consistent with the expectation of a

As a waveguide, the dissimilar-chain structure radically differs from the
well-studied identical-chain system. It is characterized by three speeds of the
long waves, two for the separate chains, and one for the intact strip where the
chains are connected. Accordingly, there exist three ranges, the subsonic for
both chains, the intersonic and the supersonic. The speed in the latter range
is supersonic for the intact strip and at the same time, it is subsonic for the
separate higher-speed chain. This fact allows the splitting wave to propagate
in the strip supersonically. We derive steady-state analytical solutions and
find that the splitting can propagate steadily only in two of these speed
ranges, the subsonic and the supersonic, whereas the intersonic regime is
forbidden. In the case of considerable difference in the chain stiffness, the
lowest dynamic threshold corresponds to the supersonic regime. The peculiarity
of the supersonic mode is that the supersonic energy delivery channel, being
initially absent, is opening with the moving splitting point. Based on the
discrete and related continuous models we find which regime can be implemented
depending on the structure parameters and loading conditions. The analysis
allows us to represent the characteristics of such processes and to demonstrate
strengths and weaknesses of different formulations, quasi-static, dynamic,
discrete or continuous. Analytical solutions for steady-state regimes are
obtained and analyzed in detail. We find the force-speed relations and show the
difference between the static and dynamic thresholds. The parameters and energy
of waves radiated by the propagating splitting are determined. We calculate the

changing the liquid content in this situation, we consider a simple foam
geometry known as a bubble lens: a bubble partially filling a narrow, straight
channel with a single film spanning the gap between the bubble and the opposite
wall. The triple vertices of this structure are decorated with Plateau borders
whose area determines the liquid fraction of the foam.
  We derive new expressions to allow the pressure in the Plateau borders to be
calculated, and determine numerically the range of driving velocities for which
the system reaches a steady state. As the liquid fraction increases, the lens
moves more slowly and the spanning film is more greatly distorted, reducing the
range of stable driving velocities. For higher velocities, the spanning film
moves so quickly that it leaves the bubble behind, a situation which must be
avoided in any particular application.

for measurement of time delay from the light curves of the images of a
gravitationally lensed quasar. The refinements mainly consist of a more
pragmatic approach to choose the smoothing time-scale free parameter,
generation of more realistic synthetic light curves for estimation of time
delay uncertainty and using a plot of normalized $\chi^2$ computed over a wide
range of trial time delay values to assess the reliability of a measured time
delay and also for identifying instances of catastrophic failure. We rigorously
tested the difference-smoothing algorithm on a large sample of more than
thousand pairs of simulated light curves having known true time delays between
them from the two most difficult `rungs' -- rung3 and rung4 -- of the first
edition of Strong Lens Time Delay Challenge (TDC1) and found an inherent
tendency of the algorithm to measure the magnitude of time delay to be higher
than the true value of time delay. However, we find that this systematic bias
is eliminated by applying a correction to each measured time delay according to
the magnitude and sign of the systematic error inferred by applying the time
delay estimator on synthetic light curves simulating the measured time delay.
Following these refinements, the TDC performance metrics for the
difference-smoothing algorithm are found to be competitive with those of the
best performing submissions of TDC1 for both the tested `rungs'. The MATLAB
codes used in this work and the detailed results are made publicly available at

power plants to adapt the supply to the fluctuating demand. An alternative
approach is controlling the demand side in such a way that certain appliances
modify their operation to adapt to the power availability. This is specially
important to achieve a high penetration of renewable energy sources. A number
of methods to manage the demand side have been proposed. In this work we focus
on dynamic demand control (DDC), where smart appliances can delay their
switchings depending on the frequency of the system. We introduce a simple
model to study the effects of DDC on the frequency of the power grid. The model
includes the power plant equations, a stochastic model for the demand that
reproduces, adjusting a single parameter, the statistical properties of
frequency fluctuations measured experimentally, and a generic DDC protocol. We
find that DDC can reduce small and medium size fluctuations but it can also
increase the probability of observing large frequency peaks due to the
necessity of recovering pending task. We also conclude that a deployment of DDC
around 30-40\% already allows a significant reduction of the fluctuations while
keeping the number of pending tasks low.

steps toward development of a real estate portal in Switzerland. Based on
continuous web crawling of publicly available real estate advertisements and
using building data from Open Street Map, we developed a system, where we
roughly estimate the rental and sale price indexes of 1.7 million buildings
across the country. In addition to these rough estimates, we developed a web
based API for accurate automated valuation of rental prices of individual
properties and spatial sensitivity analysis of rental market. We tested several
established function approximation methods against the test data to check the
quality of the rental price estimations and based on our experiments, Random
Forest gives very reasonable results with the median absolute relative error of
6.57 percent, which is comparable with the state of the art in the industry. We
argue that while recently there have been successful cases of real estate
portals, which are based on Big Data, majority of the existing solutions are
expensive, limited to certain users and mostly with non-transparent underlying
systems. As an alternative we discuss, how using the crawled data sets and
other open data sets provided from different institutes it is easily possible
to develop data driven services for spatial and temporal sensitivity analysis
in the real estate market to be used for different stakeholders. We believe

However, developers still lack affordable and accurate technology to measure

such problem. To this end, we introduce JetsonLEAP, a framework that supports
the implementation of energy-aware programs. JetsonLEAP consists of an embedded
hardware, in our case, the Nvidia Tegra TK1 System-on-a-chip device, a circuit
to control the flow of energy, of our own design, plus a library to instrument
program parts. We discuss two different circuit setups. The most precise setup
lets us reliably measure the energy spent by 225,000 instructions, the least
precise, although more affordable setup, gives us a window of 975,000
instructions. To probe the precision of our system, we use it in tandem with a
high-precision, high-cost acquisition system, and show that results do not
differ in any significant way from those that we get using our simpler
apparatus. Our entire infrastructure - board, power meter and both circuits -
can be reproduced with about $500.00. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
framework, we have used it to measure the energy consumed by programs running
on ARM cores, on the GPU, and on a remote server. Furthermore, we have studied
