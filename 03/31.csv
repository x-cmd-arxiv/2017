(products, other users, etc.). However, many untrustworthy users give
fraudulent ratings for excessive monetary gains. In the paper, we present
FairJudge, a system to identify such fraudulent users. We propose three
metrics: (i) the fairness of a user that quantifies how trustworthy the user is
in rating the products, (ii) the reliability of a rating that measures how
reliable the rating is, and (iii) the goodness of a product that measures the
quality of the product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable
ratings that are close to the goodness of the product. We formulate a mutually
recursive definition of these metrics, and further address cold start problems
and incorporate behavioral properties of users and products in the formulation.
We propose an iterative algorithm, FairJudge, to predict the values of the
three metrics. We prove that FairJudge is guaranteed to converge in a bounded
number of iterations, with linear time complexity. By conducting five different
experiments on five rating platforms, we show that FairJudge significantly
outperforms nine existing algorithms in predicting fair and unfair users. We
reported the 100 most unfair users in the Flipkart network to their review
fraud investigators, and 80 users were correctly identified (80% accuracy). The
FairJudge algorithm is already being deployed at Flipkart.

densifications to accomplish the ambitious goals for aggregate multi-user sum

attention back to applicable resource allocation (RA), which need to be
applicable for very short radio frames, large and dense sets of radio heads,
and large user populations in the coordination area. So far, mainly CSI-based
RA schemes have been proposed for this task. However, they have considerable
complexity and also incur a significant CSI acquisition overhead on the system.
In this paper, we study an alternative approach which promises lower complexity
with also a lower overhead. We propose to base the RA in multi-antenna CRAN
systems on the position information of user terminals only. We use Random
Forests as supervised machine learning approach to determine the multi-user
RAs. This likely leads to lower overhead costs, as the acquisition of position
information requires less radio resources in comparison to the acquisition of
instantaneous CSI. The results show the following findings: I) In general,
learning-based RA schemes can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to
CSI-based scheme; II) If taking the system overhead into account,
learning-based RA scheme utilizing position information outperform legacy
CSI-based scheme by up to 100%; III) Despite their dependency on the training
data, Random Forests based RA scheme is robust against position inaccuracies
and changes in the propagation scenario; IV) The most important factor
influencing the performance of learning-based RA scheme is the antenna
orientation, for which we present three approaches that restore most of the
original performance results. To the best of our knowledge, these insights are
new and indicate a novel as well as promising approach to master the complexity

optimization to learn encoder, quantizer, and decoder. However, the quantizer
is non-differentiable, and discrete entropy estimation usually is required for
rate control. These make it very challenging to develop a convolutional network
(CNN)-based image compression system. In this paper, motivated by that the
local information content is spatially variant in an image, we suggest that the
bit rate of the different parts of the image should be adapted to local
content. And the content aware bit rate is allocated under the guidance of a
content-weighted importance map. Thus, the sum of the importance map can serve
as a continuous alternative of discrete entropy estimation to control
compression rate. And binarizer is adopted to quantize the output of encoder
due to the binarization scheme is also directly defined by the importance map.
Furthermore, a proxy function is introduced for binary operation in backward
propagation to make it differentiable. Therefore, the encoder, decoder,
binarizer and importance map can be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner
by using a subset of the ImageNet database. In low bit rate image compression,
experiments show that our system significantly outperforms JPEG and JPEG 2000
by structural similarity (SSIM) index, and can produce the much better visual

the probe and the swimmers sterically hinder the probe's diffusive motion. In
competition with this steric hindrance is an enhancement driven by the activity

by $Pe_s = U_0 a /D_P$. The active contribution to the diffusivity scales as
$Pe_s^2$ for weak swimming and $Pe_s$ for strong swimming, but the transition

emergence of a magnetic flux rope in a magnetized coronal, leading either to
eruptions or to stable configurations, we test several global scalar quantities
for the ability to discriminate between the eruptive and the non-eruptive
simulations. From the magnetic field generated by the three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we compute and analyse the evolution of the
magnetic flux, of the magnetic energy and its decomposition into potential and
free energies, and of the relative magnetic helicity and its decomposition.
Unlike the magnetic flux and magnetic energies, magnetic helicities are able to
markedly distinguish the eruptive from the non-eruptive simulations. We find
that the ratio of the magnetic helicity of the current-carrying magnetic field
to the total relative helicity presents the highest values for the eruptive
simulations, in the pre-eruptive phase only. We observe that the eruptive
simulations do not possess the highest value of total magnetic helicity. In the
framework of our numerical study, the magnetic energies and the total relative
helicity do not correspond to good eruptivity proxies. Our study highlights
that the ratio of magnetic helicities diagnoses very clearly the eruptive

magnetic-helicity-based quantities may be very efficient for the prediction of

theory (in $d=4$ dimensions), to third order in chiral perturbation theory

This is done in the presence of an additional coupling, involving a parameter
$\eta$, describing the effect of a small explicit symmetry breaking term (quark
mass). For the chiral limit $\eta=0$ we demonstrate consistency with our
previous $\chi$PT computations of the finite-volume mass gap and isospin
susceptibility. For the massive case by computing the leading mass effect in
the susceptibility using $\chi$PT with dimensional regularization, we determine
the $\chi$PT expansion for $\eta$ to third order. The behavior of the shape
coefficients for long tube geometry obtained here might be of broader interest.
The susceptibility calculated from the rotator approximation differs from the
$\chi$PT result in terms vanishing like $1/\ell$ for $\ell=L_t/L_s\to\infty$.
We show that this deviation can be described by a correction to the rotator

  Large-Scale Data Centers",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most load balancing techniques implemented in current data centers tend to
rely on a mapping from packets to server IP addresses through a hash value
calculated from the flow five-tuple. The hash calculation allows extremely fast
packet forwarding and provides flow `stickiness', meaning that all packets
belonging to the same flow get dispatched to the same server. Unfortunately,
such static hashing may not yield an optimal degree of load balancing, e.g.,
due to variations in server processing speeds or traffic patterns. On the other
hand, dynamic schemes, such as the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) scheme,
provide a natural way to mitigate load imbalances, but at the expense of
stickiness violation.
  In the present paper we examine the fundamental trade-off between stickiness
violation and packet-level latency performance in large-scale data centers. We
establish that stringent flow stickiness carries a significant performance
penalty in terms of packet-level delay. Moreover, relaxing the stickiness
requirement by a minuscule amount is highly effective in clipping the tail of
the latency distribution. We further propose a bin-based load balancing scheme
that achieves a good balance among scalability, stickiness violation and
packet-level delay performance. Extensive simulation experiments corroborate
the analytical results and validate the effectiveness of the bin-based load
balancing scheme.

However, for getting grades for complex tasks, which require specific skills

crowd graders, grading based on partial perspectives becomes a big challenge
for evaluating complex tasks through crowdsourcing. Especially for those tasks
which not only need specific knowledge for grading, but also should be graded

propose a framework for grading complex tasks via multiple views, which are
different grading perspectives defined by experts for the task, to provide
uniformity. Aggregation algorithm based on graders variances are used to
combine the grades for each view. We also detect bias patterns of the graders,
and debias them regarding each view of the task. Bias pattern determines how
the behavior is biased among graders, which is detected by a statistical
technique. The proposed approach is analyzed on a synthetic data set. We show
that our model gives more accurate results compared to the grading approaches

symmetry breaking is studied theoretically and numerically for segregating
binary Bose--Einstein condensates in quasi-two-dimensional systems. Due to the
dynamic scaling law of the phase ordering kinetics, the domain-area
distribution is described by a universal function of the domain area, rescaled
by the mean distance between domain walls. The scaling theory for general
coarsening dynamics in two dimensions hypothesizes that the distribution during
the coarsening dynamics has a hierarchy with the two scaling regimes, the
microscopic and macroscopic regimes with distinct power-law exponents. The
power law in the macroscopic regime, where the domain size is larger than the
mean distance, is universally represented with the Fisher's exponent of the
percolation theory in two dimensions. On the other hand, the power-law exponent
in the microscopic regime is sensitive to the microscopic dynamics of the
system. This conjecture is confirmed by large-scale numerical simulations of
the coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equation for binary condensates. In the numerical
experiments of the superfluid system, the exponent in the microscopic regime
anomalously reaches to its theoretical upper limit of the general scaling
theory. The anomaly comes from the quantum-fluid effect in the presence of
circular vortex sheets, described by the hydrodynamic approximation neglecting
the fluid compressibility. It is also found that the distribution of superfluid
circulation along vortex sheets obeys a dynamic scaling law with different
power-law exponents in the two regimes. An analogy to quantum turbulence on the
hierarchy of vorticity distribution and the applicability to chiral superfluid

Autoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (NARX) is implemented. This
network considers input history of 30 minutes and output feedback of 120
minutes. Solar wind parameters mainly velocity, density and interplanetary
magnetic field are used as inputs. SYMH and ASYH indices during geomagnetic
storms of 1998-2013, having minimum SYMH <-85 nT are used as the target for
training two independent networks. We present the prediction of SYMH and ASYH
indices during 9 geomagnetic storms of solar cycle 24 including the recent
largest storm occurred on St. Patrick's day, 2015. The present prediction model
reproduces the entire time profile of SYMH and ASYH indices along with small
variations of ~ 10-30 minutes to good extent within noise level, indicating
significant contribution of interplanetary sources and past state of the
magnetosphere. Therefore, the developed networks can predict SYMH and ASYH
indices about an hour before, provided, real-time upstream solar wind data is
available. However, during the main phase of major storms, residuals
(observed-modeled) are found to be large, suggesting influence of internal
factors such as magnetospheric processes

phase-space trajectories of conservative Hamiltonian systems. The round-off
errors break the time reversibility and the displacement from the initial
condition, occurring when we integrate it forward and backward for the same
time interval, is related to the dynamical character of the trajectory. If the
motion is chaotic, in the sense of non-zero maximal Characteristic Lyapunov
Exponent (mLCE), then REM increases exponentially with time, as exp \lambda t,
while when the motion is regular (quasi-periodic) then REM increases as a power
law in time, as t^{\alpha}, where {\alpha} and {\lambda} are real coefficients.
We compare the REM with a variant of mLCE, the Mean Exponential Growth factor
of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). The test set includes the restricted three body
problem and five resonant planetary systems: HD 37124, Kepler-60, Kepler-36,
Kepler-29 and Kepler-26. We found a very good agreement between the outcomes of
these algorithms. Moreover, the numerical implementation of REM is astonishing
simple, and is based on solid theoretical background. The REM requires only a
symplectic and time-reversible (symmetric) integrator of the equations of
motion. This method is also CPU efficient. It may be particularly useful for
the dynamical analysis of multiple planetary systems in the KEPLER sample,
characterized by low-eccentricity orbits and relatively weak mutual
interactions. As an interesting side-result, we found a possible stable chaos
occurrence in the Kepler-29 planetary system.

mission, launched at the end of 2013, is expected to detect of the order of few
million EBs over a 5-year mission.
  We present an automated procedure to characterize EBs based on the geometric
morphology of their LCs with two aims: first to study an ensemble of EBs on a
statistical ground without the need to model the binary system, and second to
enable the automated identification of EBs that display atypical LCs. We model
the folded LC geometry of EBs using up to two Gaussian functions for the
eclipses and a cosine function for any ellipsoidal-like variability that may be
present between the eclipses. The procedure is applied to the OGLE-III data set
of EBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as a proof of concept. The bayesian
information criterion is used to select the best model among models containing
various combinations of those components, as well as to estimate the
significance of the components.
  Based on the two-Gaussian models, EBs with atypical LC geometries are
successfully identified in two diagrams, using the Abbe values of the original
and residual folded LCs, and the reduced $\chi^2$. Cleaning the data set from
the atypical cases and further filtering out LCs that contain non-significant
eclipse candidates, the ensemble of EBs can be studied on a statistical ground
using the two-Gaussian model parameters. For illustration purposes, we present
the distribution of projected eccentricities as a function of orbital period
for the OGLE-III set of EBs in the LMC, as well as the distribution of their

invariants of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[G]$-lattices whose extension of scalars to
$\mathbb{Q}_p$ is self-dual, called regulator constants. These were originally
introduced by Dokchitser--Dokchitser in the context of elliptic curves.
Regulator constants canonically yield a pairing between the space of Brauer
relations for G and the subspace of the representation ring for which regulator
constants are defined. For all G, we show that this pairing is never
identically zero. For formal reasons, this pairing will, in general, have
non-trivial kernel. But, if G has cyclic Sylow p-subgroups and we restrict to
considering permutation lattices, then we show that the pairing is
non-degenerate modulo the formal kernel. Using this we can show that, for
certain groups, including dihedral groups of order 2p for p odd, the
isomorphism class of any $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattice whose extension of scalars
to $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is self-dual, is determined by its regulator constants, its
extension of scalars to $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and a cohomological invariant of
Yakovlev.

  Affinity",,,,,"cs.LG physics.chem-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or
cheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular
docking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and
binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models
require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded
as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model
to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general
3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical
interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application
to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural
network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of
a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with
the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding
pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the
protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the
interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by
predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes
found in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics
and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve
experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform
or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all
previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are
end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven,
physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for
future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.

through which temporal cavity solitons of externally-driven, passive, Kerr
resonators can form robust long-range bound states. These bound states,
sometime also referred to as multi-soliton states or soliton crystals in
microresonators, require perturbations to the strict Lugiato-Lefever mean field
description of temporal cavity solitons. Binding occurs when the perturbation
excites a narrowband resonance in the soliton spectrum, which gives long
oscillatory tails to the solitons. Those tails can then interlock for a
discrete set of temporal separations between the solitons. The universality of
this mechanism is demonstrated in fiber ring cavities by providing experimental
observations of long-range bound states ensuing from three different
perturbations: third-order dispersion (dispersive wave generation), the
periodic nature of the cavity (Kelly sidebands), and the random birefringence
of the resonator. Sub-picosecond resolution of bound state separations and
their dynamics are obtained by using the dispersive Fourier transform
technique. Good agreement with theoretical models, including a new vector
mean-field model, is also reported.

hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of massive galaxy clusters (M_200c =
10^14-10^15 M_Sun) with baryon particle masses of ~10^6 M_Sun. Designed to
study the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key
part of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project (Barnes et al. 2017). They use a galaxy
formation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield
both realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent
with observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters
agrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up
to 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at
stellar masses Mstar > 10^10 M_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively
consistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function
matches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are
fewer low-mass (Mstar < 10^10 M_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of
clusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching.
Conversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in
clusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts (>
5r_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of
(sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to ~0.3 dex even well beyond
r_200c. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive
field haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.

further correcting for the implicit bias in virial mass measurements, the
implied GWB drops significantly but is still in tension with the most stringent

$3.6\sigma$ for the CRTS and PTF samples respectively. Although not decisive,

  Origin of giant clumps in gas-rich galaxy discs","MNRAS accepted",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1622",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Different from Milky-Way-like galaxies, discs of gas-rich galaxies are
clumpy. It is believed that the clumps form because of gravitational
instability. However, a necessary condition for gravitational instability to
develop is that the disc must dissipate its kinetic energy effectively, this
energy dissipation (also called cooling) is not well-understood. We propose
that collisions (coagulation) between molecular clouds dissipate the kinetic
energy of the discs, which leads to a dynamical cooling. The effectiveness of
this dynamical cooling is quantified by the dissipation parameter $D$, which is
the ratio between the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff}\approx 1/ \sqrt{G \rho_{\rm
disc}}$ and the cooling time determined by the cloud collision process $t_{\rm
cool}$. This ratio is related to the ratio between the mean surface density of
the disc $\Sigma_{\rm disc}$ and the mean surface density of molecular clouds
in the disc $\Sigma_{\rm cloud}$. When $D <1/3$ (which roughly corresponds to
$\Sigma_{\rm disc} < 1/3 \Sigma_{\rm cloud}$), cloud collision cooling is
inefficient, and fragmentation is suppressed. When $D > 1/3$ (which roughly
corresponds to $\Sigma_{\rm disc} > 1/3 \Sigma_{\rm cloud}$), cloud-cloud
collisions lead to a rapid cooling through which clumps form. On smaller
scales, cloud-cloud collisions can drive molecular cloud turbulence. This
dynamical cooling process can be taken into account in numerical simulations as
a subgrid model to simulate the global evolution of disc galaxies.

optimization methods when used in conjunctions with smooth kernels. An analysis
based on the spectral properties of the kernel demonstrates that only a
vanishingly small portion of the function space is reachable after a polynomial
number of gradient descent iterations. This lack of approximating power
drastically limits gradient descent for a fixed computational budget leading to
serious over-regularization/underfitting. The issue is purely algorithmic,
persisting even in the limit of infinite data.
  To address this shortcoming in practice, we introduce EigenPro iteration,
based on a preconditioning scheme using a small number of approximately
computed eigenvectors. It can also be viewed as learning a new kernel optimized
for gradient descent. It turns out that injecting this small (computationally
inexpensive and SGD-compatible) amount of approximate second-order information
leads to major improvements in convergence. For large data, this translates
into significant performance boost over the standard kernel methods. In
particular, we are able to consistently match or improve the state-of-the-art
results recently reported in the literature with a small fraction of their
computational budget.
  Finally, we feel that these results show a need for a broader computational
perspective on modern large-scale learning to complement more traditional
statistical and convergence analyses. In particular, many phenomena of
large-scale high-dimensional inference are best understood in terms of
optimization on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where standard algorithms
can sometimes have properties at odds with finite-dimensional intuition. A
systematic analysis concentrating on the approximation power of such algorithms
within a budget of computation may lead to progress both in theory and

metallic-line A1 V star Sirius A, brightest star in the sky, orbited in a
50.13-year period by Sirius B, the brightest and nearest white dwarf (WD).
Using images obtained over nearly two decades with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST), along with photographic observations covering almost 20 years, and
nearly 2300 historical measurements dating back to the 19th century, we
determine precise orbital elements for the visual binary. Combined with the
parallax and the motion of the A component, these elements yield dynamical
masses of 2.063+/-0.023 Msun and 1.018+/-0.011 Msun for Sirius A and B,
respectively. Our precise HST astrometry rules out third bodies orbiting either
star in the system, down to masses of ~15-25 Mjup. The location of Sirius B in
the H-R diagram is in excellent agreement with theoretical cooling tracks for
WDs of its dynamical mass, and implies a cooling age of ~126 Myr. The position
of Sirius B in the mass-radius plane is also consistent with WD theory,
assuming a carbon-oxygen core. Including the pre-WD evolutionary timescale of
the assumed progenitor, the total age of Sirius B is about 228+/-10 Myr. We
calculated evolutionary tracks for stars with the dynamical mass of Sirius A,
using two independent codes. We find it necessary to assume a slightly
sub-solar metallicity, of about 0.85 Zsun, to fit its location in the
luminosity-radius plane. The age of Sirius A based on these models is about
237-247 Myr, with uncertainties of +/-15 Myr, consistent with that of the WD
companion. We discuss astrophysical puzzles presented by the Sirius system,
including the probability that the two stars must have interacted in the past,
even though there is no direct evidence for this, and the orbital eccentricity
remains high.

of self-driving vehicles. These models need to be explainable - they should
provide easy-to-interpret rationales for their behavior - so that passengers,
insurance companies, law enforcement, developers etc., can understand what
triggered a particular behavior. Here we explore the use of visual
explanations. These explanations take the form of real-time highlighted regions
of an image that causally influence the network's output (steering control).
Our approach is two-stage. In the first stage, we use a visual attention model
to train a convolution network end-to-end from images to steering angle. The
attention model highlights image regions that potentially influence the
network's output. Some of these are true influences, but some are spurious. We
then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions actually
influence the output. This produces more succinct visual explanations and more
accurately exposes the network's behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model on three datasets totaling 16 hours of driving. We first show that
training with attention does not degrade the performance of the end-to-end
network. Then we show that the network causally cues on a variety of features
that are used by humans while driving.

charged impurities cannot be avoided, but their effect can be reduced by
compensation doping, i.e. by introducing defects of opposite charge. Screening
in such a system leads to the formation of electron-hole puddles, which
dominate bulk transport, as first recognized by Efros and Shklovskii. Metallic
surface states of topological insulators (TI) contribute extra screening
channels, suppressing puddles. We investigate the typical length $l_p$, which
determines the distance between puddles and the suppression of puddle formation
close to metallic surfaces in the limit where the gap $\Delta$ is much larger
than the typical Coulomb energy $E_c$ of neighboring dopants, $\Delta \gg E_c$.
In particular, this is relevant for three dimensional Bi-based topological
insulators, where $\Delta/E_c \sim 100$. Scaling arguments predict $l_p \sim
(\Delta/E_c)^2$. In contrast, we find numerically that $l_p$ is much smaller
and grows in an extended crossover regime approximately linearly with
$\Delta/E_c$ for numerically accessible values, $\Delta/E_c \lesssim 35$. We
show how a quantitative scaling argument can be used to extrapolate to larger
$\Delta/E_c$, where $l_p \sim (\Delta/E_c)^2/\ln(\Delta/E_c)$. Our results can
be used to predict a characteristic thickness of TI thin films, below which the
sample quality is strongly enhanced.

  Intelligence",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel method called the Relevance Subject Machine (RSM) to solve
the person re-identification (re-id) problem. RSM falls under the category of
Bayesian sparse recovery algorithms and uses the sparse representation of the
input video under a pre-defined dictionary to identify the subject in the
video. Our approach focuses on the multi-shot re-id problem, which is the
prevalent problem in many video analytics applications. RSM captures the
essence of the multi-shot re-id problem by constraining the support of the
sparse codes for each input video frame to be the same. Our proposed approach
is also robust enough to deal with time varying outliers and occlusions by
introducing a sparse, non-stationary noise term in the model error. We provide
a novel Variational Bayesian based inference procedure along with an intuitive
interpretation of the proposed update rules. We evaluate our approach over
several commonly used re-id datasets and show superior performance over current
state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, for ILIDS-VID, a recent large scale
re-id dataset, RSM shows significant improvement over all published approaches,
achieving an 11.5% (absolute) improvement in rank 1 accuracy over the closest
competing algorithm considered.

study on the exo-atmosphere of Qatar-1b, an exoplanet that looks much like HD
189733b regarding its host star activity level, their surface gravity, scale
height, equilibrium temperature and transit parameters. Thus, our motivation
relied on carrying out a comparative study of their atmospheres, and assess if
these are regulated by their environment. In this work we present one primary
transit of Qatar-1b obtained during September, 2014, using the 8.1 m GEMINI
North telescope. The observations were performed using the GMOS-N instrument in
multi-object spectroscopic mode. We collected fluxes of Qatar-1 and six more
reference stars, covering the wavelength range between 460 and 746 nm. The
achieved photometric precision of 0.18 parts-per-thousand in the white light
curve, at a cadence of 165 seconds, makes this one of the most precise datasets
obtained from the ground. We created 12 chromatic transit light curves that we
computed by integrating fluxes in wavelength bins of different sizes, ranging
between 3.5 and 20 nm. Although the data are of excellent quality, the
wavelength coverage and the precision of the transmission spectrum are not
sufficient to neither rule out or to favor classic atmospheric models.
Nonetheless, simple statistical analysis favors the clear atmosphere scenario.
A larger wavelength coverage or space-based data is required to characterize
the constituents of Qatar-1b's atmosphere and to compare it to the well known
HD 189733b. On top of the similarities of the orbital and physical parameters
of both exoplanets, from a long Halpha photometric follow-up of Qatar-1,
presented in this work, we find Qatar-1 to be as active as HD 189733.

Counterfactual Gaussian Process (CGP) to predict the counterfactual future

showing a transition between different mesoscopic regimes. Furthermore, by
experimentally introducing a novel concept, the supercurrent spectral density,
we determine the supercurrent-phase relation in a tunnelling experiment, thus

X-ray band recently unveiled by \nustar~(3$-$79 keV) where these objects show a
hard spectrum which enables us to constrain the inverse Compton peak and the

with the synchrotron peak located in the sub-millimeter range and the inverse
Compton peak in the MeV range, and therefore belong to the MeV blazar class.

the multi-user interference constructively rather than to suppress it. We
propose a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOOP) via the weighted
Tchebycheff method to study the trade-off between the two desirable system
design objectives namely the total downlink transmit power minimisation and the
total uplink transmit power minimisation problems at the same time ensuring the
required quality-of-service (QoS) for all users. In the proposed MOOP, we adapt
the QoS constraints for the downlink users to accommodate constructive
interference (CI) for both generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated signals
as well as for quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals. We also extended
our work to a robust design to study the system with imperfect uplink, downlink
and self-interference CSI. Simulation results and analysis show that,
significant power savings can be obtained. More importantly, however, the MOOP
approach here allows for the power saved to be traded off for both uplink and
downlink power savings, leading to an overall energy efficiency improvement in
the wireless link.

new advertising auction platform by Zillow, as Zillow switched from negotiated
contracts to using auctions in several geographically isolated markets. A
unique feature of this experiment is that the bidders in this market are real
estate agents that bid on their own behalf, not using third-party
intermediaries. To help bidders, Zillow also provided a recommendation tool
that suggested a bid for each bidder.
  Our main focus in this paper is on the decisions of bidders whether or not to
adopt the platform-provided bid recommendation. We observe that a significant
proportion of bidders do not use the recommended bid. Using the bid history of
the agents we infer their value, and compare the agents' regret with their
actual bidding history with results they would have obtained following the
recommendation. We find that for half of the agents not following the
recommendation, the increased effort of experimenting with alternate bids
results in increased regret, i.e., they get decreased net value out of the
system. The proportion of agents not following the recommendation slowly
declines as markets mature, but it remains large in most markets that we
observe. We argue that the main reason for this phenomenon is the lack of trust
in the platform-provided tool.
  Our work provides an empirical insight into possible design choices for
auction-based online advertising platforms. While search advertising platforms
(such as Google or Bing) allow bidders to submit bids on their own, many
display advertising platforms (such as Facebook) optimize bids on bidders'
behalf and eliminate the need for bids. Our empirical analysis shows that the
latter approach is preferred for markets where bidders are individuals, who
don't have access to third party tools, and who may question the fairness of
platform-provided suggestions.

two UI commands. We propose a systematic static code analysis procedure that
searches for Blob Listeners that we implement in InspectorGuidget. We conducted

guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget
feasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in
recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her.
  This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in
2010. There have been a number of improvements on the approximation guarantee

valuation is a monotone submodular function. We offer two general frameworks
for simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly
improve on the best known results for this problem, while also simplifying the

monotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets
(where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More
generally, given an $r$ approximation algorithm for the optimization problem

neural correlates of self-generated forms of thought, with current evidence
pointing toward central roles for the default, frontoparietal, and visual
networks. Recent work has linked the arising of thoughts more specifically to
default network activity, but the limited temporal resolution of fMRI has
precluded more detailed conclusions about where in the brain self-created
mental content is generated and how this is achieved. Here I argue that the
unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG)
in human epilepsy patients can begin to provide answers to questions about the
specific neural origins of self-generated thought. I review the extensive body
of literature from iEEG studies over the past few decades and show that many
studies involving passive recording or direct electrical stimulation throughout
the brain all point to the medial temporal lobe as a key site of
thought-generation. At the same time, null effects from other brain regions
suggest that various other default network hubs, such as the posterior
cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule, might have only a marginal role
(if any) in the self-generation or initiation of mental content like dreams,
visual imagery, memories, and prospective simulations. Ultimately, combining a
variety of neuroscientific methods that compensate for each other's weaknesses
and complement each other's strengths may prove to be the most effective way to
understand the brain's remarkable ability to decouple from the immediate

heliopause have intensities several hundred times those measured at the Earth
by PAMELA at nearly the same energies. This paper compares this new V1 data
with data from the earth-orbiting PAMELA experiment up to energies greater than
10 GeV where solar modulation effects are negligible. In this energy regime we
assume the main parameters governing electron propagation are diffusion and
energy loss and we use a Monte Carlo program to describe this propagation in
the galaxy. To reproduce the new Voyager electron spectrum, which is E-1.3,
together with that measured by PAMELA which is E-3.20 above 10 GeV, we require
a diffusion coefficient which is P 0.45 at energies above 0.5 GeV changing to a
P-1.00 dependence at lower rigidities. The entire electron spectrum observed at
both V1 and PAMELA from 3 MeV to 30 GeV can then be described by a simple
source spectrum, dj/dP P-2.25, with a spectral exponent that is independent of
rigidity. The change in exponent of the measured electron spectrum from -1.3 at
low energies to 3.2 at the highest energies can be explained by galactic
propagation effects related to the changing dependence of the diffusion
coefficient below 0.5 GeV, and the increasing importance above 0.5 GV of energy
loss from synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, which are both E2, and
which are responsible for most of the changing spectral exponent above 1.0 GV.
  As a result of the P-1.00 dependence of the diffusion coefficient below 0.5
GV that is required to fit the V1 electron spectrum, there is a rapid flow of
these low energy electrons out of the galaxy. These electrons in local IG space
are unobservable to us at any wave length and therefore form a dark energy
component which is 100 times the electrons rest energy.

separable (due to each agent only asking for one item), are not monotone, and
do not satisfy the gross substitute property-- increase in price of an item can
result in increased demand for the item. Devanur and Kannan in FOCS 08 showed
that market clearing prices can be found in polynomial time in markets with
fixed number of items and general PLC preferences. They also consider Fischer
markets with fixed number of agents (instead of fixed number of items), and
give a polynomial time algorithm for this case if preferences are separable

$\leq$ 1.9 yrs (rest). This includes equal occurrences of strengthening and
weakening plus the emergence of a new BAL system at $-$38,800 km/s accompanied
by dramatic strengthening in a mini-BAL at $-$22,800 km/s. We infer from

saturated with line-of-sight covering fractions ranging from 0.27 to 0.80 in
the highest to lowest column density regions, respectively. Three of the
mini-BALs also provide evidence for saturation and partial covering based on
$\sim$1:1 doublet ratios. We speculate that the BALs and mini-BALs form in
similar clumpy/filamentary outflows, with mini-BALs identifying smaller or
fewer clumps along our lines of sight. If we attribute the line variabilities
to clumps crossing our lines of sight at roughly Keplerian speeds, then a
typical variability time in our study, $\sim$1.1 yrs, corresponds to a distance
$\sim$2 pc from the central black hole. Combining this with the speed and

number of gas detections in these systems, to test our understanding of the
origin and evolution of this gaseous component. It is assumed that all debris
discs with icy planetesimals create second generation CO, C and O gas at some
level, and the aim of this paper is to predict that level and assess its
observability. We present a new semi-analytical equivalent of the numerical
model of Kral et al. (2016) allowing application to large numbers of
systems.That model assumes CO is produced from volatile-rich solid bodies at a
rate that can be predicted from the debris disc's fractional luminosity. CO
photodissociates rapidly into C and O that then evolve by viscous spreading.
This model provides a good qualitative explanation of all current observations,
with a few exceptional systems that likely have primordial gas. The radial
location of the debris and stellar luminosity explain some non-detections, e.g.
close-in debris (like HD 172555) is too warm to retain CO, while high stellar
luminosities (like $\eta$ Tel) result in short CO lifetimes. We list the most
promising targets for gas detections, predicting $>15$ CO detections and $>30$
CI detections with ALMA, and tens of CII and OI detections with future far-IR
missions. We find that CO, CI, CII and OI gas should be modelled in non-LTE for
most stars, and that CO, CI and OI lines will be optically thick for the most
gas-rich systems. Finally, we find that radiation pressure, which can blow out
CI around early-type stars, can be suppressed by self-shielding.

collision is studied in the framework of kinetic theory. We discuss the
approach to local thermal equilibrium, and the onset of hydrodynamics, in terms
of a particular set of moments of the distribution function. These moments
quantify the momentum anisotropies to a finer degree than the commonly used
ratio of longitudinal to transverse pressures. They are found to be in direct
correspondence with viscous corrections of hydrodynamics, and provide therefore
an alternative measure of these corrections in terms of the distortion of the
momentum distribution. As an application, we study the evolution of these
moments by solving the Boltzmann equation for a boost invariant expanding
system, first analytically in the relaxation time approximation, and then
numerically for a quark-gluon plasma within the small angle approximation to
the collision kernel.

where $f_0$ and $f_1$ denote the number of vertices and edges, respectively.
This parameter measures how much $P$ deviates from being simple.
  It turns out that the excess degree of a $d$-polytope does not take every
natural number: the smallest possible values are $0$ and $d-2$, and the value
$d-1$ only occurs when $d=3$ or 5. On the other hand, for fixed $d$, the number
of values not taken by the excess degree is finite if $d$ is odd, and the
number of even values not taken by the excess degree is finite if $d$ is even.
  The excess degree is then applied in three different settings. It is used to
show that polytopes with small excess (i.e. $\xi(P)<d$) have a very particular
structure: provided $d\ne5$, either there is a unique nonsimple vertex, or
every nonsimple vertex has degree $d+1$. This implies that such polytopes
behave in a similar manner to simple polytopes in terms of Minkowski
decomposability: they are either decomposable or pyramidal, and their duals are
always indecomposable. Secondly, we characterise completely the decomposable
$d$-polytopes with $2d+1$ vertices (up to combinatorial equivalence). And
thirdly all pairs $(f_0,f_1)$, for which there exists a 5-polytope with $f_0$
vertices and $f_1$ edges, are determined.

Likewise, twin boundaries reduce the external field required to nucleate domain
walls and provide strong pinning potentials, with the pinning strength
dependent on the twinning angle. The relative strengths of the known twin
defect types are quantified based on the anisotropy angles across their
boundaries. Samples that have undergone heat treatment are imaged using
electron back-scatter diffraction. The precise crystallographic orientation is
mapped spatially and converted into a number of realistic finite element
models, which are used to compute the effects of large concentrations of twin

the remanence coercivity and squareness. The maximum energy product

limit of the material and much lower than MnAl permanent magnets that have been
further processed to remove twin defects. The knowledge gained in this study

communications are considered as a standard part of future mobile networks,
where operators/consumers involve the devices in direct communication to
improve the cellular system throughput, latency, fairness, and energy
efficiency. However, battery life of mobile devices involved in such
communications is crucial for 5G smartphone users to explore the emerging
applications in DCS. It is anticipated that the owners of 5G-enabled
smartphones use their devices more extensively to talk, text, email, and surf
the Web more often than do customers with 4G smartphones or traditional
handsets, which puts a significantly higher demand on the battery life.
Smartphones are currently equipped with multiple radio interfaces that enable
them to access different types of wireless networks including LTE-direct and
Wi-Fi-direct, besides cellular networks. Such a capability is not well explored
within the context of DCS. This article proposes a new scheme to support the
emerging features in DCS where a D2D-enabled mobile device (sink device or a
file/content requester) aggregates the radio resources of multiple mobile
devices (source devices or file/content providers) via its multiple radio
interfaces such that the scheme is referred to as devices-to-device (Ds2D)
communications. Ds2D communication scheme ensures an optimal packet split among
the source mobile devices to improve the file/content transfer latency (FTL),
energy efficiency, and battery life. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed optimal packet split scheme among multiple source devices
participating in Ds2D communication scheme guarantees an improvement in mobile
battery life over wide range of data rate levels in comparison with the random
packet split strategy and traditional D2D communication paradigm between the
sink and source mobile devices.

$n$-gram language model (LM) smoothing.
  Experiments on a small corpus (UPenn Treebank, one million words of training
data and 10k vocabulary) have found the LSTM cell with dropout to be the best
model for encoding the $n$-gram state when compared with feed-forward and
vanilla RNN models. When preserving the sentence independence assumption the
LSTM $n$-gram matches the LSTM LM performance for $n=9$ and slightly
outperforms it for $n=13$. When allowing dependencies across sentence
boundaries, the LSTM $13$-gram almost matches the perplexity of the unlimited
history LSTM LM.
  LSTM $n$-gram smoothing also has the desirable property of improving with
increasing $n$-gram order, unlike the Katz or Kneser-Ney back-off estimators.
Using multinomial distributions as targets in training instead of the usual
one-hot target is only slightly beneficial for low $n$-gram orders.
  Experiments on the One Billion Words benchmark show that the results hold at
larger scale: while LSTM smoothing for short $n$-gram contexts does not provide
significant advantages over classic N-gram models, it becomes effective with
long contexts ($n > 5$); depending on the task and amount of data it can match
fully recurrent LSTM models at about $n=13$. This may have implications when
modeling short-format text, e.g. voice search/query LMs.
  Building LSTM $n$-gram LMs may be appealing for some practical situations:
the state in a $n$-gram LM can be succinctly represented with $(n-1)*4$ bytes
storing the identity of the words in the context and batches of $n$-gram
contexts can be processed in parallel. On the downside, the $n$-gram context
encoding computed by the LSTM is discarded, making the model more expensive
than a regular recurrent LSTM LM.

Considering that the appearance gap (dataset bias) between synthetic and real
smoke images degrades significantly the performance of the trained model on the
test set composed fully of real images, we build deep architectures based on
domain adaptation to confuse the distributions of features extracted from
synthetic and real smoke images. This approach expands the domain-invariant
feature space for smoke image samples. With their approximate feature
distribution off non-smoke images, the recognition rate of the trained model is
improved significantly compared to the model trained directly on mixed dataset
of synthetic and real images. Experimentally, several deep architectures with
different design choices are applied to the smoke detector. The ultimate
framework can get a satisfactory result on the test set. We believe that our

well as a mask based on the encoder-decoder framework. On the other hand, a
discriminator network aims to detect fake images. The network is trained with
three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The
spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct.
Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to
the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic.

$N_{\rm eff}$, is insufficient for probing generic, interacting models of DR.
In this work, we perform likelihood analyses which allow both free-streaming
effective neutrinos (parametrized by $N_{\rm eff}$) and interacting effective
neutrinos (parametrized by $N_{\rm fld}$). We motivate an alternative
parametrization of DR in terms of $N_{\rm tot}$ (total effective number of
neutrinos) and $f_{\rm fs}$ (the fraction of effective neutrinos which are
free-streaming), which is less degenerate than using $N_{\rm eff}$ and $N_{\rm
fld}$. Using the Planck 2015 likelihoods in conjunction with measurements of
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find constraints on the total amount of
beyond the Standard Model effective neutrinos (both free-streaming and
interacting) of $\Delta N_{\rm tot} < 0.39$ at 2$\sigma$. In addition, we
consider the possibility that this scenario alleviates the tensions between
early-time and late-time cosmological observations, in particular the
measurements of $\sigma_8$ (the amplitude of matter power fluctuations at
8$h^{-1}$ Mpc), finding a mild preference for interactions among light species.
We further forecast the sensitivities of a variety of future experiments,
including Advanced ACTPol (a representative CMB Stage-III experiment), CMB
Stage-IV, and the Euclid satellite. This study is relevant for probing
non-standard neutrino physics as well as a wide variety of new particle physics

standard-model has tree level contribution, coming from a charged Higgs alone
is highly unlikely. However these decay modes are good probes to search for
small charged Higgs signal if we can construct sensitive observables in these

much more sensitivity to the presence of charged Higgs than the usual

number of antennas at the base station, are expected to enhance network
throughput by enabling improved multiuser MIMO techniques. To deploy many
antennas in reasonable form factors, base stations are expected to employ
antenna arrays in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, which is known as
full-dimension (FD) MIMO. The most popular two-dimensional array is the uniform
planar array (UPA), where antennas are placed in a grid pattern. To exploit the
full benefit of massive MIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD), the
downlink channel state information (CSI) should be estimated, quantized, and
fed back from the receiver to the transmitter. However, it is difficult to
accurately quantize the channel in a computationally efficient manner due to
the high dimensionality of the massive MIMO channel. In this paper, we develop
both narrowband and wideband CSI quantizers for FD-MIMO taking the properties
of realistic channels and the UPA into consideration. To improve quantization
quality, we focus on not only quantizing dominant radio paths in the channel,
but also combining the quantized beams. We also develop a hierarchical beam
search approach, which scans both vertical and horizontal domains jointly with
moderate computational complexity. Numerical simulations verify that the
performance of the proposed quantizers is better than that of previous CSI
quantization techniques.

that finite completability of the sampled tensor is equivalent to having a
certain number of algebraically independent polynomials among the defined
polynomials. Our proposed approach results in characterizing the maximum number
of algebraically independent polynomials in terms of a simple geometric
structure of the sampling pattern, and therefore we obtain the deterministic
necessary and sufficient condition on the sampling pattern for finite
completability of the sampled tensor. Moreover, assuming that the entries of
the tensor are sampled independently with probability $p$ and using the
mentioned deterministic analysis, we propose a combinatorial method to derive a
lower bound on the sampling probability $p$, or equivalently, the number of
sampled entries that guarantees finite completability with high probability. We
also show that the existing result for the matrix completion problem can be
used to obtain a loose lower bound on the sampling probability $p$. In
addition, we obtain deterministic and probabilistic conditions for unique

remains a formidable barrier to their incorporation into a range of

and tungsten dichalcogenides with a large fraction of the periodic table. An
automated analysis of the energetics, atomic and electronic structure of
thousands of calculations results in insightful trends across the periodic
table and points out promising dopants to be pursued experimentally. Beyond
previously studied cases, our predictions suggest promising substitutional
dopants that result in p-type transport and reveal interesting physics behind
the substitution of the metal site. Doping with early transition metals (TMs)
leads to tensile strain and a significant reduction in the bandgap. The bandgap
increases and strain is reduced as the d-states are filled into the mid TMs;
these trends reverse are we move into the late TMs. Additionally, the Fermi
energy increases monotonously as the d-shell is filled from the early to mid
TMs and we observe few to no gap states indicating the possibility of both p-
(early TMs) and n- (mid TMs) type doping. Quite surprisingly, the simulations
indicate the possibility of interstitial doping of TMDs; the energetics reveal
that a significant number of dopants, increasing in number from molybdenum
disulfide to diselenide and to ditelluride, favor the interstitial sites over
adsorbed ones. Furthermore, calculations of the activation energy associated
with capturing the dopants into the interstitial site indicate that the process
is kinetically possible. This suggets that interstitial impurities in TMDs are
more common than thought to date and we propose a series of potential
interstitial dopants for TMDs relevant for application in nanoelectronics based
on a detailed analysis of the predicted electronic structures.

automated feature is attained by utilizing a programmable phase-only spatial

process which is, in general, inherently nonunitary. Some examples of

how they will be affected by the pixelated structure of the SLM screen. The
method proposed here enables one to implement much more general transformations

  Rotorcraft","8 pages",,,,"cs.NE cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-adaptive parameters are increasingly used in the field of Evolutionary
Robotics, as they allow key evolutionary rates to vary autonomously in a
context-sensitive manner throughout the optimisation process. A significant
limitation to self-adaptive mutation is that rates can be set unfavourably,
which hinders convergence. Rate restarts are typically employed to remedy this,
but thus far have only been applied in Evolutionary Robotics for mutation-only
algorithms. This paper focuses on the level at which evolutionary rate restarts
are applied in population-based algorithms with more than 1 evolutionary
operator. After testing on a real hexacopter hovering task, we conclude that
individual-level restarting results in higher fitness solutions without fitness
stagnation, and population restarts provide a more stable rate evolution.
Without restarts, experiments can become stuck in suboptimal controller/rate
combinations which can be difficult to escape from.

games. When the solution space is a Banach space $B$ endowed with a quadratic
norm $\|\cdot\|$, the optimal measure (mixed strategy) for such games (e.g. the
adversarial recovery of $u\in B$, given partial measurements $[\phi_i, u]$ with
$\phi_i\in B^*$, using relative error in $\|\cdot\|$-norm as a loss) is a
centered Gaussian field $\xi$ solely determined by the norm $\|\cdot\|$, whose
conditioning (on measurements) produces optimal bets. When measurements are
hierarchical, the process of conditioning this Gaussian field produces a
hierarchy of elementary bets (gamblets). These gamblets generalize the notion
of Wavelets and Wannier functions in the sense that they are adapted to the
norm $\|\cdot\|$ and induce a multi-resolution decomposition of $B$ that is
adapted to the eigensubspaces of the operator defining the norm $\|\cdot\|$.
When the operator is localized, we show that the resulting gamblets are
localized both in space and frequency and introduce the Fast Gamblet Transform
(FGT) with rigorous accuracy and (near-linear) complexity estimates. As the FFT
can be used to solve and diagonalize arbitrary PDEs with constant coefficients,
the FGT can be used to decompose a wide range of continuous linear operators
(including arbitrary continuous linear bijections from $H^s_0$ to $H^{-s}$ or
to $L^2$) into a sequence of independent linear systems with uniformly bounded

mathematizes the frequency dependent selection of competing strategies vying to

paper, we deal with two discrete versions of the replicator equation employed
to study evolution in a population where any two players, interaction is
modeled by a two-strategy symmetric normal-form game. There are twelve distinct
classes of such games, each typified by a particular ordinal relationship among
the elements of the corresponding payoff matrix. Here we find the sufficient
conditions for the existence of asymptotic solutions of the replicator
equations such that the solutions -- fixed points, periodic orbits, and chaotic
trajectories -- are all strictly physical, meaning that the frequency of any
strategy lies inside the closed interval zero to one at all times. Thus, we
elaborate which of the twelve types of games are capable of showing meaningful
physical solutions and for which of the two types of replicator equation.
Subsequently, we introduce the concept of the weight of fitness deviation that
is the scaling factor in a positive affine transformation connecting two payoff
matrices such that the corresponding one-shot games have exactly same Nash
equilibria and evolutionary stable states. The weight also quantifies how much
the excess of fitness of a strategy over the average fitness of the population
affects the per capita change in the frequency of the strategy. Intriguingly,
the weight's variation is capable of making the Nash equilibria and the
evolutionary stable states useless by introducing strict physical chaos in the
replicator dynamics based on the normal-form game.

projected separation normalized by the Einstein radius is s = 1.1 or 0.9 for
the wide and close solutions, respectively. We estimate the physical parameters

brown-dwarf or late M-dwarf host with a mass of $0.10^{+0.16}_{-0.05}M_{\odot}$

bulge. Such low-mass planetary systems in the Bulge are rare because the
detection efficiency of planets in short microlensing events is relatively low.
This discovery may suggest that such low mass planetary systems are abundant in
the Bulge and currently on-going high cadence survey programs will detect more

and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that was developed in subsequent
steps over several years. The model is meant to describe the evolution of AD in
vivo. In [Y. Achdou et al., 2013] we treated the problem at a microscopic
scale, where the typical length scale is a multiple of the size of the soma of
a single neuron. Subsequently, in [M. Bertsch at al., 2016] we concentrated on
the macroscopic scale, where brain neurons are regarded as a continuous medium,
structured by their degree of malfunctioning.
  In the second part of the paper we consider the relation between the
microscopic and the macroscopic models. In particular we show under which
assumptions the kinetic transport equation, which in the macroscopic model
governs the evolution of the probability measure for the degree of
malfunctioning of neurons, can be derived from a particle-based setting.
  In the microscopic model we consider basically mechanism i), modelling it by
a system of Smoluchowski equations for the amyloid concentration (describing
the agglomeration phenomenon), with the addition of a diffusion term as well as
of a source term on the neuronal membrane. At the macroscopic level instead we
model processes i) and ii) by a system of Smoluchowski equations for the
amyloid concentration, coupled to a kinetic-type transport equation for the
distribution function of the degree of malfunctioning of the neurons. The
second equation contains an integral term describing the random onset of the
disease as a jump process localized in particularly sensitive areas of the
brain.
  Even though we deliberately neglected many aspects of the complexity of the
brain and the disease, numerical simulations are in both cases (microscopic and
macroscopic) in good qualitative agreement with clinical data.

study non-Markovian quantum dynamics of the dark state in a $\Lambda$-type

counter-rotating terms on the dark state. In contrast to the dark state within
the RWA, leakage of the dark state occurs even at zero temperature, as a result
of these counter-rotating terms. Also, we present a method to restore the
quantum coherence of the dark state by applying a leakage elimination operator

for short periods. We present a set of idealised simulations of AGN outflows
affecting turbulent gas spheres, and investigate the effect of the outflow and
the AGN radiation field upon gas fragmentation. We show that AGN outflows of
sufficient luminosity shut off fragmentation while the nucleus is active, but
gas compression results in a burst of fragmentation after the AGN switches off.
Self-shielding of gas against the AGN radiation field allows some fragmentation
to occur during outbursts, but too much shielding results in a lower overall
fragmentation rate. For our idealised simulation setup, there is a critical AGN
luminosity which results in the highest fragmentation rate, with outflows being
too efficient at removing gas when $L > L_{\rm crit}$ and not efficient enough
to compress the gas to high densities otherwise. These results, although
preliminary, suggest that the interaction between AGN and star formation in
their host galaxies is particularly complex and requires careful study in order

can occur due to the suppression of spin scattering or weak localization, large
negative MR is rare in materials, and when it happens, it is usually related to
magnetism. The large negative MR in Weyl semimetals is peculiar in that it is
unrelated to magnetism and comes from chiral anomaly. Here we report that there
is a new mechanism for large negative MR which is not related to magnetism but
is related to disorder. In the newly-synthesized bulk-insulating topological
insulator TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$, we observed gigantic negative MR
reaching 98% in 14 T at 10 K, which is unprecedented in a nonmagnetic system.
Supported by numerical simulations, we argue that this phenomenon is likely due
to the Zeeman effect on a barely percolating current path formed in the
disordered bulk. Since disorder can also lead to non-saturating linear MR in
Ag$_{2+\delta}$Se, the present finding suggests that disorder engineering in
narrow-gap systems is useful for realizing gigantic MR in both positive and
negative directions.

to minimize the total transmission cost of the network, including cost within
the radio access network (RAN) and cost incurred by transmission to the core
network via backhaul links. The optimal redundancy ratio under given system
configuration is obtained with adapted particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm. We analyze the impact of important system parameters through
Monte-Carlo simulation. Results show that the optimal redundancy ratio is
mainly influenced by two parameters, which are the backhaul to RAN unit cost
ratio and the steepness of file popularity distribution. The total cost can be
reduced by up to 54% at given unit cost ratio of backhaul to RAN when the
optimal redundancy ratio is selected. Under typical file request pattern, the
reduction amount can be up to 57%.

equations involving a ""sum of squares"" operator $\mathcal{L}$ on a compact
manifold $\mathcal{M}$ assuming: $(i)$ the Chow-Rashevski-H\""ormander condition
ensuring the hypoellipticity of $\mathcal{L}$, and $(ii)$ the analyticity of
$\mathcal{M}$ and the coefficients of $\mathcal{L}$.
  The first result is the tunneling estimate $\|\varphi\|_{L^2(\omega)} \geq
Ce^{- \lambda^{\frac{k}{2}}}$ for normalized eigenfunctions $\varphi$ of
$\mathcal{L}$ from a nonempty open set $\omega\subset \mathcal{M}$, where $k$
is the hypoellipticity index of $\mathcal{L}$ and $\lambda$ the eigenvalue.
  The main result is a stability estimate for solutions to the hypoelliptic
wave equation $(\partial_t^2+\mathcal{L})u=0$: for $T>2 \sup_{x \in
\mathcal{M}}(dist(x,\omega))$ (here, $dist$ is the sub-Riemannian distance),
the observation of the solution on $(0,T)\times \omega$ determines the data.
The constant involved in the estimate is $Ce^{c\Lambda^k}$ where $\Lambda$ is
the typical frequency of the data.
  We then prove the approximate controllability of the hypoelliptic heat
equation $(\partial_t+\mathcal{L})v=1_\omega f$ in any time, with appropriate
(exponential) cost, depending on $k$. In case $k=2$ (Grushin, Heisenberg...),
we further show approximate controllability to trajectories with polynomial
cost in large time.
  We also explain how the analyticity assumption can be relaxed, and a boundary
$\partial \mathcal{M}$ can be added in some situations.
  Most results turn out to be optimal on a family of Grushin-type operators.
  The main proof relies on the general strategy developed by the authors in

model to describe the traffic variation pattern for a single base station in
real cellular networks. Firstly a sinusoid superposition model is proposed for
describing the temporal traffic variation of multiple base stations based on
real data in a current cellular network. It shows that the mean traffic volume
of many base stations in an area changes periodically and has three main
frequency components. Then, lognormal distribution is verified for spatial
modeling of real traffic data. The spatial traffic distributions at both spare
time and busy time are analyzed. Moreover, the parameters of the model are
presented in three typical regions: park, campus and central business district.
Finally, an approach for combined spatial-temporal traffic modeling of single
base station is proposed based on the temporal and spatial traffic distribution
of multiple base stations. All the three models are evaluated through
comparison with real data in current cellular networks. The results show that
these models can accurately describe the variation pattern of real traffic data

those of the Dirac fermion. However, their chiralities are exactly opposite.
The chiral KK modes of gravitinos could be localized in some types of
$f(R)$-thick branes on introducing a coupling term. We investigate the
localization of a gravitino on three types of $f(R)$-thick branes through a
Yukawa-like coupling term with background scalar fields. It has been shown that
all the KK modes of gravitinos cannot be localized in the pure geometric
$f(R)$-thick branes by adding a five-dimensional gravitino mass term. However,
for the $f(R)$-thick branes generated by one or two background scalar fields,
only the left- or right-handed zero mode could be localized in the branes, and
the massive KK resonant modes are the same for both left- and right-handed
gravitinos despite their opposing chiralities. All these results are consistent
with those of the five-dimensional Dirac fermion except their chiralities,

Usually, surface plasmon polaritons are suggested for this purpose, but they

understand the origin of magnetic fields in such late-type giant stars. In
analogy with late-type dwarf stars, we focus primarily on parameters known to
influence the generation of magnetic fields in the outer convective envelope.
We compute the classical dynamo parameters along the evolutionary tracks of
low- and intermediate-mass stars at various metallicities using stellar models
that have been extensively tested by spectroscopic and asteroseismic
observations. These include convective turnover timescales and convective
Rossby numbers, computed from the PMS to the tip of the RGB or the early AGB.
To investigate the effects of the very extended outer convective envelope, we
compute these parameters both for the entire convective envelope and locally,
that is, at different depths within the envelope. We also compute the turnover
timescales and corresponding Rossby numbers for the convective cores of
intermediate-mass stars on the main sequence.
  Our models show that the Rossby number of the convective envelope becomes
lower than unity in the well-delimited locations of the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram where magnetic fields have indeed been detected. We show that
alpha-omega dynamo processes might not be continuously operating, but that they
are favored in the stellar convective envelope at two specific moments along
the evolution tracks, that is, during the first dredge-up at the base of the
RGB and during central helium burning in the helium-burning phase and
early-AGB. This general behavior can explain the so-called magnetic strips
recently discovered by dedicated spectropolarimetric surveys of evolved stars.

from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using deep neural networks

lumpectomy. Methods: To train the DNNs, we use both the state-of-the-art
methods (Weight Decay and DropOut) and a newly introduced regularization method
based on function norms. Commonly used methods can fail when only a small
database is available. The use of a function norm introduces a direct control
over the complexity of the function with the aim of diminishing the risk of
overfitting. Results: As neither the code nor the data of previous results are
publicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in
the literature for a conservative comparison. Moreover, our method is applied
to locally collected data on several data configurations. The reported results
are the average over the different trials. Conclusion: The experimental results
show that the use of DNNs yields significantly better results than other
techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score,
G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Function norm regularization
yielded higher and more robust results than competing methods. Significance: We
have demonstrated a system that shows high promise for (partially) automated
margin assessment of human breast tissue, Equal error rate (EER) is reduced
from approximately 12\% (the lowest reported in the literature) to 5\%\,--\,a
58\% reduction. The method is computationally feasible for intraoperative

${{\mathrm{\Lambda{CDM}}}}$ model extended to $\Sigma m_\nu$, for which we
advocate the use of three mass-degenerate neutrinos. We focus on the study of
systematic uncertainties linked to the foregrounds modelling in CMB data
analysis, and on the impact of the present knowledge of the reionisation
optical depth. This is done through the use of different likelihoods built from
Planck data. Limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ are derived with various combinations of

Supernovae (SN) results. We also discuss the impact of the preference for
current CMB data for amplitudes of the gravitational lensing distortions higher
than expected within the ${{\mathrm{\Lambda{CDM}}}}$ model, and add the Planck
CMB lensing. We then derive a robust upper limit: $\Sigma m_\nu< 0.17\hbox{ eV

discuss the neutrino mass repartition and show that today's data do not allow

work towards being able to predict their occurrence. However, many aspects of
CME formation and eruption remain unclear, including whether magnetic flux
ropes are present before the onset of eruption and the key mechanisms that
cause CMEs to occur. In this work, the pre-eruptive coronal configuration of an
active region that produced an interplanetary CME with a clear magnetic flux
rope structure at 1 AU is studied. A forward-S sigmoid appears in
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data two hours before the onset of the eruption
(SOL2012-06-14), which is interpreted as a signature of a right-handed flux
rope that formed prior to the eruption. Flare ribbons and EUV dimmings are used
to infer the locations of the flux rope footpoints. These locations, together
with observations of the global magnetic flux distribution, indicate that an
interaction between newly emerged magnetic flux and pre-existing sunspot field
in the days prior to the eruption may have enabled the coronal flux rope to
form via tether-cutting-like reconnection. Composition analysis suggests that
the flux rope had a coronal plasma composition, supporting our interpretation
that the flux rope formed via magnetic reconnection in the corona. Once formed,
the flux rope remained stable for 2 hours before erupting as a CME.

some cases (the \emph{subtree} reduction) the reduction rules behave similarly
with respect to treewidth, while others (the \emph{cluster} reduction) behave
very differently, and the behaviour of the \emph{chain reduction} is
particularly intriguing because of its link with graph separators and forbidden
minors. We also show that the gap between treewidth and Tree Bisection and
Reconnect (TBR) distance can be infinitely large, and that unlike, for example,
planar graphs the treewidth of the display graph can be as much as linear in
its number of vertices. On a slightly different note we show that if a display
graph is formed from the fusion of a phylogenetic network and a tree, rather
than from two trees, the treewidth of the display graph is bounded whenever the
tree can be topologically embedded (""displayed"") within the network. This opens
the door to the formulation of the display problem in Monadic Second Order

supporting the interaction can be viewed as a local deformation of the plane.
It is known that the essential spectrum of this Schr\""odinger operator
coincides with $[-\frac14\alpha^2,+\infty)$. We prove that for all sufficiently
small $\beta > 0$ its discrete spectrum is non-empty and consists of a unique
simple eigenvalue. Moreover, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of this
eigenvalue in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0+$. In particular, this eigenvalue
tends to $-\frac14\alpha^2$ exponentially fast as $\beta\rightarrow 0+$.

linearized compressible, viscous fluid and an elastic plate (in the absence of
rotational inertia). Unlike existing work in the literature, we linearize the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations about an arbitrary state (assuming the
fluid is barotropic), and so the fluid PDE component of the interaction will
generally include a nontrivial ambient flow profile $ \mathbf{U}$. The
appearance of this term introduces new challenges at the level of the
stationary problem. In addition, the boundary of the fluid domain is
unavoidably Lipschitz, and so the well-posedness argument takes into account
the technical issues associated with obtaining necessary boundary trace and
elliptic regularity estimates. Much of the previous work on flow-plate models
was done via Galerkin-type constructions after obtaining good a priori
estimates on solutions (specifically \cite {Chu2013-comp}---the work most
pertinent to ours here); in contrast, we adopt here a Lumer-Phillips approach,
with a view of associating solutions of the fluid-structure dynamics with a
$C_{0}$-semigroup $\left\{ e^{ \mathcal{A}t}\right\} _{t\geq 0}$ on the natural
finite energy space of initial data. So, given this approach, the major
challenge in our work becomes establishing of the maximality of the operator
$\mathcal{A}$ which models the fluid-structure dynamics. In sum: our main
result is semigroup well-posedness for the fully coupled fluid-structure
dynamics, under the assumption that the ambient flow field $ \mathbf{U}\in
\mathbf{H}^{3}(\mathcal{O})$ has zero normal component trace on the boundary (a
standard assumption with respect to the literature). In the final sections we
address well-posedness of the system in the presence of the von Karman plate
nonlinearity, as well as the stationary problem associated with the dynamics.

argue for a vertically extended corona as opposed to two compact and distinct
primary sources. We find two neutral absorbers (one full-covering and one
partial-covering), an ionized absorber ($\log \xi = 2.8$), and a highly-ionized
ultra-fast outflow, which have all been reported previously. All analyzed
spectra are well described by this baseline model. The bulk of the spectral
variability between 1 keV and 6 keV can be accounted for by changes in the
column density of both neutral absorbers, which appear to be degenerate and
inversely correlated with the variable hard continuum component flux. We track
variability in absorption on both short (2 d) and long ($\sim$1 yr) timescales;
the observed evolution is either consistent with changes in the absorber
structure (clumpy absorber at distances ranging from the broad line region
(BLR) to the inner torus or a dusty radiatively driven wind) or a geometrically
stable neutral absorber that becomes increasingly ionized at a rising flux
level. The soft X-rays below 1 keV are dominated by photoionized emission from
extended gas that may act as a warm mirror for the nuclear radiation.

structure, such as the fields of a record, the variants of a union, or the
elements of a container. These data accessors are collectively known as optics;
they are fundamental to programs that manipulate complex data. INQUIRY:
Individual data accessors for simple data structures are easy to write, for
example as pairs of ""getter"" and ""setter"" methods. However, it is not obvious
how to combine data accessors, in such a way that data accessors for a compound
data structure are composed out of smaller data accessors for the parts of that
structure. Generally, one has to write a sequence of statements or declarations
that navigate step by step through the data structure, accessing one level at a
time - which is to say, data accessors are traditionally not first-class
citizens, combinable in their own right. APPROACH: We present a framework for
modular data access, in which individual data accessors for simple data
structures may be freely combined to obtain more complex data accessors for
compound data structures. Data accessors become first-class citizens. The
framework is based around the notion of profunctors, a flexible generalization
of functions. KNOWLEDGE: The language features required are higher-order
functions (""lambdas"" or ""closures""), parametrized types (""generics"" or
""abstract types""), and some mechanism for separating interfaces from
implementations (""abstract classes"" or ""modules""). We use Haskell as a vehicle
in which to present our constructions, but languages such as Java, C#, or Scala
that provide the necessary features should work just as well. GROUNDING: We
provide implementations of all our constructions, in the form of a literate
program: the manuscript file for the paper is also the source code for the
program, and the extracted code is available separately for evaluation. We also
prove the essential properties demonstrating that our profunctor-based
representations are precisely equivalent to the more familiar concrete
representations. IMPORTANCE: Our results should pave the way to simpler ways of
writing programs that access the components of compound data structures.

language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language abstraction
solutions during software development. It involves the implementation and
immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also
aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to
modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support.
Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we
address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of
DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of
general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both
domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect
development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools
like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving
nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g.,
Awesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation
approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in
the presence of other aspect languages. We extend AspectJ with a small set of
annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a
semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools.
Our transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to
implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with
those DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both
DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing
DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of
using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective
compared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our
approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then
implemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box. We implemented
Cool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be
accommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two
open source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process
application-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost
of developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of
programming with them. Crosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern
real-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right
tool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus
facilitating use of DSAL solutions in the software development process.

Reactive programming favors a wide class of contemporary software systems that
respond to user input, network messages, and other events. While reactive
programming is an active field of research, the implementation of reactive
concepts remains challenging. In particular, change detection represents a hard
but inevitable necessity when implementing reactive concepts. Typically, change
detection mechanisms are not intended for reuse but are tightly coupled to the
particular change resolution mechanism. As a result, developers often have to
re-implement similar abstractions. A reusable primitive for change detection is
still missing. To find a suitable primitive, we identify commonalities in
existing reactive concepts. We discover a class of reactive concepts,
state-based reactive concepts. All state-based reactive concepts share a common
change detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an
expression. On the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism,
we propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the
tedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease
the implementation of reactive programming concepts. We evaluate the design of
active expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive
concepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness
of active expressions. Active expressions enable the separation of essential
from non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts. By
using active expressions as a primitive for change detection, developers of
reactive language constructs and runtime support can now focus on the design of
how application programmers should be able to react to change. Ultimately, we
would like active expressions to encourage experiments with novel reactive
programming concepts and with that to yield a wider variety of them to explore.

specific language (EDSL) with good code-readability. They allow EDSL authors to
define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language
syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined
syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A
user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be
regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of
user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The
compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the
operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities
by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to
implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is
association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is
whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new
custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined
operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java
but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing
custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a
variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an
environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of
instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the
host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our
system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object.
This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static
name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a
system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an
object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed
system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the
compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out
semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running,
is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid
ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a
programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a
parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss
its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have
conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also
show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express
various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any
kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers
should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the
host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their
own syntax and name binding.

connection between each edit and its manifestation at run-time. Such immediacy
may conflict with the desire to perform a combined set of intermediate steps,
such as a refactoring, without immediately taking effect after each individual
edit. This becomes important when an incomplete sequence of small-scale changes
can easily break the running program. State-of-the-art solutions focus on
retroactive recovery mechanisms, such as debugging or version control. In
contrast, we propose a proactive approach: Multiple individual changes to the
program are collected in an Edit Transaction, which can be made effective if
deemed complete. Upon activation, the combined steps become visible together.
Edit Transactions are capable of dynamic scoping, allowing a set of changes to
be tested in isolation before being extended to the running application. This
enables a live programming workflow with full control over change granularity,
immediate feedback on tests, delayed effect on the running application, and
coarse-grained undos. We present an implementation of Edit Transactions along
with Edit-Transaction-aware tools in Squeak/Smalltalk. We asses this
implementation by conducting a case study with and without the new tool
support, comparing programming activities, errors, and detours for implementing
new functionality in a running simulation. We conclude that workflows using
Edit Transactions have the potential to increase confidence in a change, reduce
potential for run-time errors, and eventually make live programming more

Two important problems in practice are that, first, current reversible

building one reversible debugger, it is difficult to transfer that achievement
to a new programming environment. The user observes a bug when arriving at an
error. Searching backwards for the corresponding fault may require many reverse
steps. Ultimately, the user prefers to write an expression that will transition

watchpoint facility based on top of snapshots and record/replay.
Expression-transition watch- points are implemented as binary search through
the timeline of a program execution, while using the snapshots as landmarks
within that timeline. This allows for debugging of subtle bugs that appear only
after minutes or more of program execution. When a bug occurs within seconds of
program startup, repeated debugging sessions suffice. Reversible debugging is
preferred for bugs seen only after minutes. This architecture allows for an
efficient and easy-to-write snapshot-based reversibe debugger on top of a

interpreters and the implementation of a framework-level metaobject protocol

adaptation to tailor the interpreter's behavior on the task to be solved and to
introduce new features to fulfill unforeseen requirements. Many languages
provide a MOP that to some degree supports reflection. However, MOPs are
typically language-specific, their reflective functionality is often
restricted, and the adaptation and application logic are often mixed which
hardens the understanding and maintenance of the source code. Our system
overcomes these limitations. Approach: We designed and implemented a system to
support open programming language interpreters. The prototype implementation is
integrated in the Neverlang framework. The system exposes the structure,
behavior and the runtime state of any Neverlang-based interpreter with the
ability to modify it. Knowledge: Our system provides a complete control over
interpreter's structure, behavior and its runtime state. The approach is
applicable to every Neverlang-based interpreter. Adaptation code can
potentially be reused across different language implementations. Grounding:
Having a prototype implementation we focused on feasibility evaluation. The
paper shows that our approach well addresses problems commonly found in the
research literature. We have a demonstrative video and examples that illustrate
our approach on dynamic software adaptation, aspect-oriented programming,
debugging and context-aware interpreters. Importance: To our knowledge, our
paper presents the first reflective approach targeting a general framework for
language development. Our system provides full reflective support for free to
any Neverlang-based interpreter. We are not aware of any prior application of
open implementations to programming language interpreters in the sense defined
in this paper. Rather than substituting other approaches, we believe our system
can be used as a complementary technique in situations where other approaches
present serious limitations.

turbulent drag reduction. The texture consists of blade riblets in a
converging/diverging or herringbone pattern with spanwise wavelength
$\Lambda_f$. The aim is to quantify the drag change for this texture as
compared to a smooth wall and to study the underlying mechanisms. To that
purpose, Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flow in a channel with
height $L_z$ were performed. The FIK-identity for drag decomposition was
extended to textured walls and was used to study the drag change mechanisms.
For $\Lambda_f/L_z \gtrsim O(10)$, the herringbone texture behaves similarly to
a conventional parallel-riblet texture in yaw: the suppression of turbulent
advective transport results in a slight drag reduction of 2%. For
$\Lambda_f/L_z \lesssim O(1)$, the drag increases strongly with a maximum of
73%. This is attributed to enhanced mean and turbulent advection, which results
from the strong secondary flow that forms over regions of riblet
convergence/divergence. Hence, the employment of convergent/divergent riblets
in the texture seems to be detrimental to turbulent drag reduction.

about their visual appearance, captured by the RGB channel, robots heavily need

mapping them into three dimensional channels. This transfer learning procedure
makes them processable by pre-trained deep architectures. Current mappings are
based on heuristic assumptions over preprocessing steps and on what depth

which concerns Java or C-like languages. Our approach was that of software
engineers: we have processed existing research literature on the topic,
extracted both the abstract definitions of nine design defects and their
concrete implementation specifications, implemented them all in a tool we have
programmed and let it loose on a huge test set obtained from open source code
from thousands of GitHub projects. When it comes to knowledge, we have found
that more than twice as many methods in Python can be considered too long
(statistically extremely longer than their neighbours within the same project)
than in Java, but long parameter lists are seven times less likely to be found
in Python code than in Java code. We have also found that Functional
Decomposition, the way it was defined for Java, is not found in the Python code
at all, and Spaghetti Code and God Classes are extremely rare there as well.
The grounding and the confidence in these results comes from the fact that we
have performed our experiments on 32'058'823 lines of Python code, which is by
far the largest test set for a freely available Python parser. We have also
designed the experiment in such a way that it aligned with prior research on
design defect detection in Java in order to ease the comparison if we treat our
own actions as a replication. Thus, the importance of the work is both in the

subsystems is nowadays a subject of major interest in several field of
theoretical and applied physics, and the thermodynamic approach currently
favoured by practitioners is based on a phenomenological definition of an
interface energy associated with the partition, due to a lack of easily
computable expressions for a microscopic (i.e.~particle-based) interface
energy. In this article, we outline a general approach to derive sharp and
computable bounds for the interface free energy in terms of microscopic
statistical quantities. We discuss potential applications in nanothermodynamics

stellar evolution as some population synthesis models (PSM) suggest remains an
open question. Around 50 short period binary central stars ($P\sim1$ d) are
known, but with only four with measured orbital periods over 10 d, our
knowledge is severely incomplete. Here we report on the first discovery from a
systematic SALT HRS survey for long period binary central stars. We find a 142
d orbital period from radial velocities of the central star of NGC~1360,
HIP~16566. NGC~1360 appears to be the product of common-envelope (CE)
evolution, with nebula features similar to post-CE PNe, albeit with an orbital
period considerably longer than expected to be typical of post-CE PSM. The most
striking feature is a newly-identified ring of candidate low-ionisation
structures (LIS). Previous spatio-kinematic modelling of the nebula gives a
nebula inclination of $30\pm10$ deg, and assuming the binary nucleus is
coplanar with the nebula, multi-wavelength observations best fit a more
massive, evolved WD companion. A WD companion in a 142 d orbit is not the focus
of many PSM, making NGC~1360 a valuable system with which to improve future PSM
work. HIP~16566 is amongst many central stars in which large radial velocity
variability was found by low-resolution surveys. The discovery of its binary
nature may indicate long period binaries may be more common than PSM models
predict.

code artifacts are either implicit or globally declared in build scripts, which
impedes modular reasoning, separate compilation, and programmability in

design enables modular reasoning and separate compilation by preventing hidden

contrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a ""holistic"" approach: We
apply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to
predict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3D
bounding boxes. This, however, is not sufficient for handling objects from the
recent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an axis of rotational symmetry,
and the similarity of two images of such an object under two different poses
makes training the CNN challenging. We solve this problem by restricting the
range of poses used for training, and by introducing a classifier to identify
the range of a pose at run-time before estimating it. We also use an optional
additional step that refines the predicted poses. We improve the

challenges in computer vision, being a fundamental task for understanding how
visual recognition works. From a practical point of view, learning from
unsupervised visual input has an immense practical value, as very large
quantities of unlabeled videos can be collected at low cost. In this paper, we
address the task of unsupervised learning to detect and segment foreground
objects in single images. We achieve our goal by training a student pathway,
consisting of a deep neural network. It learns to predict from a single input
image (a video frame) the output for that particular frame, of a teacher
pathway that performs unsupervised object discovery in video. Our approach is
different from the published literature that performs unsupervised discovery in
videos or in collections of images at test time. We move the unsupervised
discovery phase during the training stage, while at test time we apply the
standard feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This has a dual
benefit: firstly, it allows in principle unlimited possibilities of learning
and generalization during training, while remaining very fast at testing.
Secondly, the student not only becomes able to detect in single images
significantly better than its unsupervised video discovery teacher, but it also
achieves state of the art results on two important current benchmarks, YouTube
Objects and Object Discovery datasets. Moreover, at test time, our system is at
least two orders of magnitude faster than other previous methods.

heaving motion significantly increases the average lift compared with the
steady flow, and also surpasses the quasi-steady predictions due to the

supports the formation of the $q=0$ momentum condensate, the nonlocal
hybridization $V_n$ supports the formation of the $q=\pi$ momentum condensate.
The combined effect of local and nonlocal hybridization further enhances the
excitonic correlations in $q=0$ as well as $q=\pi$ state, especially for $V$
and $V_n$ values from the charge-density-wave (CDW) region. Strong effects of
local and nonlocal hybridization are observed also for other ground-state
quantities of the model such as the $f$-electron density, or the density of
unbound $d$-electrons, which are generally enhanced with increasing $V$ and
$V_n$. The same calculations performed for nonzero values of $f$-level energy
$E_f$ revealed that this model can yield a reasonable explanation for the
pressure-induced resistivity anomaly observed experimentally in
$TmSe_{0.45}Te_{0.55}$ compound.

a distributed Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC), which provides opportunities for lower

more distributed datacenter locations) and accounts for service disruption that
could be incurred because of user mobility between the service areas of
different datacenters. Through evaluations with topology and traffic data from
a major carriers's network, we show that, compared to static, centralized
networks, careful virtualized provisioning can yield significant savings in
network costs while still minimizing service disruption due to mobility. We
demonstrate that up to a 75% reduction in redundant datacenter capacity over
the operator's current topology (while achieving the same level of resilience)
is possible by distributing load over many mobile cloud datacenters.

from the crustal magnetic field. However, measurements by satellites can only
sense the sum of the two contributions. In practice, the measured magnetic
field is expanded in spherical harmonics and separation into crust and core

In this paper, we derive a mathematical setup in which the two contributions

migration modes, namely mesenchymal and amoeboid migration. The cellular
microenvironment triggers the switch between both modes, thereby allowing
adaptation to dynamic conditions. It is, however, unclear if this
amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity contributes to a more effective tumor
invasion. We address this question with a mathematical model, where the
amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity is regulated in response to local
extracellular matrix resistance. Our numerical analysis reveals that
extracellular matrix structure and presence of a chemotactic gradient are key
determinants of the model behavior. Only in complex microenvironments, if the
extracellular matrix is highly heterogeneous and a chemotactic gradient directs
migration, the amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity allows a more
widespread invasion compared to the non-switching amoeboid and mesenchymal
modes. Importantly, these specific conditions are characteristic for in vivo
tumor invasion. Thus, our study suggests that \emph{in vitro} systems aiming at
unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor invasion should take
into account the complexity of the microenvironment by considering the combined
effects of structural heterogeneities and chemical gradients on cell migration.

valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or
prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for
this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for
prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies;
some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points
within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single
prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of
ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest
as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the
simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most
complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the
season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty,
and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to
predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States,
both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We
trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 -
2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in
the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods
showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component
models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the
component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable
predictions to public health decision makers.

phases in interacting boson and fermion systems have become a fascinating
theoretical direction in recent years. It has been shown that the (generalized)
group cohomology theory or cobordism theory can give rise to a complete
classification of SPT phases in interacting boson/spin systems. Nevertheless,
the construction and classification of SPT phases in interacting fermion
systems are much more complicated, especially in 3D. In this work, we revisit
this problem based on the equivalent class of fermionic symmetric local unitary
(FSLU) transformations. We construct very general fixed point SPT wavefunctions
for interacting fermion systems. We naturally reproduce the partial
classifications given by special group super-cohomology theory, and we show
that with an additional $\tilde{B}H^2(G_b, \mathbb Z_2)$ (the so-called
obstruction free subgroup of $H^2(G_b, \mathbb Z_2)$) structure, a complete
classification of SPT phases for three-dimensional interacting fermion systems
with a total symmetry group $G_f=G_b\times \mathbb Z_2^f$ can be obtained for
unitary symmetry group $G_b$. We also discuss the procedure of deriving a
general group super-cohomology theory in arbitrary dimensions.

inclusive forward neutron production. The observed asymmetry in $p$$+$Al
collisions is much smaller, while the asymmetry in $p$$+$Au collisions is a
factor of three larger in absolute value and of opposite sign. The interplay of
different neutron production mechanisms is discussed as a possible explanation
of the observed $A$ dependence.

genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for
co-translational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify
loci within genes that are both significantly enriched in slowly translated
codons and evolutionarily conserved. Surprisingly, we find that domain
boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead,
we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated
with co-translational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single
domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of
co-translational folding account for the majority of these loci across more
than 500 E. coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding,
this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have
been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes.
More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just
thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a

theoretical and practical interest, yet to fully reveal and understand the
interplay between pattern emergence and network structure remains to be an
outstanding problem. A fundamental issue is the effect of network structure on
the stability of the patterns. We address this issue by using the setting where
random links are systematically added to a regular lattice and focusing on the
dynamical evolution of spiral wave patterns. As the network structure deviates
more from the regular topology (so that it becomes increasingly more complex),
the original stable spiral wave pattern can disappear and a different type of
pattern can emerge. Our main findings are the following. (1) Short-distance
links added to a small region containing the spiral tip can have a more
significant effect on the wave pattern than long-distance connections. (2) As
more random links are introduced into the network, distinct pattern transitions
can occur, which include the transition of spiral wave to global
synchronization, to a chimera-like state, and then to a pinned spiral wave. (3)
Around the transitions the network dynamics is highly sensitive to small
variations in the network structure in the sense that the addition of even a
single link can change the pattern from one type to another. These findings
provide insights into the pattern dynamics in complex networks, a problem that

our framework cleanly unifies many different types of induction; as we move a

obtain a clear geometric intuition. We also provide additional tools for

as examples, we directly obtained the spectral phonon temperature (SPT) and
observed the local thermal nonequilibrium between the ballistic and diffusive

surprisingly large, and it provides an additional thermal interfacial
resistance mechanism. Our SPT results directly show that the vertical thermal
transport across the dimensionally mismatched graphene/substrate interface is
through the coupling between flexural acoustic phonons of graphene and the
longitudinal phonons in the substrate with mode conversion. In the
dimensionally matched interfaces, e.g. graphene/graphene junction and
graphene/boron nitride planar interfaces, strong coupling occurs between the
acoustic phonon modes on both sides, and the coupling decreases with
interfacial mixing. The SPT method together with the spectral heat flux can
eliminate the size effect of the thermal conductivity prediction induced from
ballistic transport. Our work shows that in thin films and across interfaces,

the robust and near-perfect adaptation of {\it E. coli} observed across a wide
range of spatially uniform attractant/repellent (ligand) concentrations. A
receptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the
two states. Enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates
active ones and the probability for it to be active depends on its level of
methylation and ligandation. A simple version of the model with two methylation
sites per receptor (M=2) shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU) akin to the
classical 2-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and
Koshland (GK). For extremely small and large ligand concentrations, the system
reduces to two 2-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous
fluctuations in activity (variance) estimated mathematically under linear noise
approximation (LNA) is found to peak near the ZOU transition. The variance is a
weak, non-monotonic and decreasing functions of ligand and receptor
concentrations. Gillespie simulations for M=2 show excellent agreement with
analytical results obtained under LNA. Numerical results for M=2, 3 and 4 show
ZOU in mean activity; the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The
magnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is
consistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling
pathway shows that this noise is large enough to have a beneficial effect on
the motility of the organism. The response of mean receptor activity to small
time-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration, computed within
linear response theory, is found to have a bilobe form.

Earth-like of all our planetary neighbours. Its size, bulk composition and
distance from the Sun are very similar to those of the Earth. Its original
atmosphere was probably similar to that of early Earth, with large atmospheric
abundances of carbon dioxide and water - possibly even a liquid water ocean.
While on Earth a moderate climate ensued, Venus experienced runaway greenhouse
warming, which led to its current hostile climate. How and why did it all go
wrong for Venus? What lessons can we learn about the life story of terrestrial
planets in general, whether in our solar system or in others?
  ESA's Venus Express mission proved very successful, answering many questions
about Earth's sibling planet and establishing European leadership in Venus
research. However, further understanding of Venus and its history requires
several more lines of investigation. Entry into the atmosphere is required to
measure noble gas isotopes to constrain formation & evolution models. Radar
mapping at metre-scale spatial resolution, and surface height change detection
at centimetre scale, would enable detection of current volcanic & tectonic
activity. A lander in the ancient tessera highlands would provide clues as to
the earliest geologic record available on Venus.
  To address these themes we propose a combination of an in situ balloon
platform, a radar-equipped orbiter, and (optionally) a descent probe. These
mission elements are modelled on the 2010 EVE M3 mission proposal, on the 2010
EnVision M3 proposal, and on Russia's Venera-D entry probe, respectively.
Together, these investigations address themes of comparative planetology and
solar system evolution.

great interest to many disciplines. This paper studies some shortcomings of the
existing dependency measures in detecting direct causal influences or their
lack of ability for group selection to capture strong dependencies and
accordingly introduces a new statistical dependency measure to overcome them.
This measure is inspired by Dobrushin's coefficients and based on the fact that
there is no dependency between $X$ and $Y$ given another variable $Z$, if and
only if the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ and $Z=z$ does not
change when $X$ takes another realization $x'$ while $Z$ takes the same
realization $z$. We show the advantages of this measure over the related
measures in the literature. Moreover, we establish the connection between our
measure and the integral probability metric (IPM) that helps to develop
estimators of the measure with lower complexity compared to other relevant
information theoretic based measures. Finally, we show the performance of this
measure through numerical simulations.

model to simulate the deformation and breakup of a ferrodroplet that is
immersed in a viscous medium and subject to an applied uniform magnetic field.
Instead of using the magnetic body force in the traditional Rosensweig model,
the key idea of this model is to propose a new magnetic energy that enables
direct effects of the magnetic field on the interface evolution. The model can
thereby be derived from the variational principle via minimizing the free
energy of the total system. This energy based modeling idea can be easily
extended to include more external fields in a convenient and consistent way for
more complicated applications involving multiple external fields. We validate
the model by performing a series of numerical simulations, including the
comparison with analytic solutions, the investigation of the effect of
different types of magnetic fields, the dynamical behaviors of the ferrodroplet
breakup under the strong magnetic field, magnetic/velocity/pressure field
distributions, the magnetic energy density, and the inertial phenomenon, etc.

persons is about three times the rate of married people of same age. This
excess mortality can be measured with good accuracy for all ages except for
young widowers. The reason is that, at least nowadays, very few people become
widowed under the age of 30. Here we show that disability data from census
records can also be used as a reliable substitute for mortality rates. In fact
excess-disability and excess-mortality go hand in hand. Moreover, as there are
about ten times more cases of disability than deaths, the disability variable
is able to offer more accurate measurements in all cases where the number of
deaths is small. This allows a more accurate investigation of the young widower
effect; it confirms that, as already suspected from death rate data, there is a
huge spike between the ages of 20 and 30. By using disability rates we can also
study additional features not accessible using death rate data. For example we
can examine the health impact of a change in living place. The observed
temporary inflated disability rate confirms what could be expected by invoking
the ""Transient Shock"" conjecture formulated by the authors in a previous paper.

the coherence of the two images still achieve good enough to generate the
digital elevation model (DEM). During the InSAR processing, we compared several
baseline estimating methods and obtained a good flat-earth phase removed
interferogram map. By using the latest SAR interferogram filter and phase
unwrapping method we proposed, we improved the coherence up to 0.88 in urban
area and obtained a high quality DEM in Ningbo area. In addition, we evaluated
the elevation model by comparing with the elevation values extracted from SRTM.
And the result shows that accuracy of the elevation map is about 5 m (RMS) in
plane area and 22m (RMS) in mountainous region, which demonstrated that
Gaofen-3 has the powerful ability of repeat-pass SAR Interferometry.

have been limited so far to scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical
Microscopy (s-NSOM) experiments where light from the sample is scattered by a
metallic-coated Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tip interacting with the material
at the nanoscale. These experiments have recently allowed imaging of plasmon
polaritons in graphene as well as hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HP2) in
hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN). Here we show that the high mechanical
sensitivity of an AFM cantilever can be exploited for imaging hyperbolic phonon
polaritons in hBN. In our imaging process, the lattice vibrations of hBN
micrometer-sized flakes are locally enhanced by the launched phonon polaritons.
These enhanced vibrations are coupled to the AFM tip in contact to the sample
surface and recorded during scanning. Imaging resolution better than
{\lambda}/20 is showed, comparable to the best resolution in s-NSOM.
Importantly, this detection mechanism is free from light background and it is
in fact the first photon-less detection of phonon polaritons.

  polymerization as a consequence of coagulative nucleation",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is demonstrated that the often observed broadness of the molecular weight
distribution obtained from latex particles synthesized by means of
surfactant-free emulsion polymerization results from the multistage kinetics.
The initial stage of the polymerization, by which the primary particles are
formed, is of the 01-kind which means that it can be assumed that the particles
are so small that at any moment of time there is no more than one radical chain
per particle. After the aggregation of primary particles into secondary
particles, the so called coagulative nucleation step, the polymerization
kinetics in the subsequently coalesced secondary particles is of the
pseudo-bulk kind which means that there are so many radicals in the particles
that the polymerization process proceeds as in bulk. The important consequence
is that the molecular weight of the 01-process is about one order of magnitude
larger than that of the pseudo-bulk process. Hence, each of these
polymerization modes and the aggregation stage in-between leave their traces in
the molecular weight distribution as is shown by experiments aimed at
prolonging the initial formation kinetics. Bimodal molecular weight
distributions are found both for ionic and non-ionic initiators.
