structure and function of biomolecules. Computational prediction of protein
mutation impacts offers a fast, economical and potentially accurate alternative
to laboratory mutagenesis. Most existing methods rely on geometric
descriptions, this work introduces a topology based approach to provide an
entirely new representation of protein mutation impacts that could not be
obtained from conventional techniques. Results: Topology based mutation
predictor (T-MP) is introduced to dramatically reduce the geometric complexity
and number of degrees of freedom of proteins, while element specific persistent
homology is proposed to retain essential biological information. The present
approach is found to outperform other existing methods in globular protein
mutation impact predictions. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 with an
RMSE of 0.92 kcal/mol is obtained on a test set of 350 mutation samples. For
the prediction of membrane protein stability changes upon mutation, the
proposed topological approach has a 84% higher Pearson correlation coefficient
than the current state-of-the-art empirical methods, achieving a Pearson
correlation of 0.57 and an RMSE of 1.09 kcal/mol in a 5-fold cross validation

saturation of this constraint enables us to predict the radiative Higgs mass
correctly. Generalization to constant curvature spaces is also given.

enhancements found in the QS regions due to a weaker feeding magnetic flux. The
observations also show that the quiet Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs) are formed at
a higher height in the upper photosphere than the photospheric continuum level.
Using simulations, we investigate the formation mechanism associated with the

this paper, we describe a modified interior-point method for the efficient
solution of large-and-sparse low-rank SDPs, which finds applications in graph

the problem data is large-and-sparse, conjugate gradients (CG) can be used to
avoid forming, storing, and factoring the large and fully-dense interior-point

ill-conditioning. Our central insight is that, for a rank-$k$, size-$n$ SDP,
the Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned only due to a rank-$nk$ perturbation,
which can be explicitly computed using a size-$n$ eigendecomposition. We
construct a preconditioner to ""correct"" the low-rank perturbation, thereby
allowing preconditioned CG to solve the Hessian equation in a few tens of
iterations. This modification is incorporated within SeDuMi, and used to reduce
the solution time and memory requirements of large-scale matrix-completion
problems by several orders of magnitude.

stable. However, when the corresponding exponent is bigger than 2, the
instability of the system grows when the power law exponent grows, indicating
that large values of the aforementioned parameter can be related to a loss in
the number of particles from the condensed state. This fact can be used also to
show that the stability conditions of the condensate are highly sensitive to
the exponent associated with the external potential.

is measured in the far field through wavefront sampling, which is performed via
dynamically reconfigurable slits implemented on a digital micromirror device

The measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of a forward

and T$_d$ structural phases that agree with density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations, and use them to identify phase fields in the MoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$
system, including single-phase 2H, 1T$^\prime$, and T$_d$ regions, as well as a
two-phase 1T$^\prime$ + T$_d$ region. Disorder arising from compositional
fluctuations in MoWTe$_2$ alloys breaks inversion and translational symmetry,
leading to the activation of an infrared 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$ mode and the
enhancement of a double-resonance Raman process in 2H-MoWTe$_2$ alloys.
Compositional fluctuations limit the phonon correlation length, which we
estimate by fitting the observed asymmetric Raman lineshapes with a phonon
confinement model. These observations reveal the important role of disorder in
MoWTe$_2$ alloys, clarify the structural phase boundaries, and provide a
foundation for future explorations of phase transitions and electronic
phenomena in this system.

  In this paper we present a full proof of the referred result, using a totally

First, by experimental measurement the functional effects of combinations of

statistical analysis of the frequencies and co-occurrences of protein residues

derive the mathematical relationship between epistasis calculated on the basis

epistatic terms: covariance implies epistasis, but epistasis does not
necessarily lead to covariance, indicating that covariance in itself is not the

epistatic contributions from the alignment, we can directly obtain a functional
prediction from the alignment statistics by applying a Walsh-Hadamard

designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of

is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather
than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard

error correction, which is crucial for prolonging the coherence time of qubits.
We propose a model device made of locally-interacting multiple qubits, designed
such that simultaneous single-qubit measurements on it can output probability
distributions whose average-case sampling is classically intractable, under
similar assumptions as the sampling of non-interacting bosons and instantaneous
quantum circuits. Notably, in contrast to these previous unitary-based
realizations, our measurement-based implementation has two distinctive
features. (i) Our implementation involves no adaptation of measurement bases,
leading output probability distributions to be generated in constant time,
independent of the system size. Thus, it could be implemented in principle
without quantum error correction. (ii) Verifying the classical intractability
of our sampling is done by changing the Pauli measurement bases only at certain
output qubits. Our usage of random commuting quantum circuits in place of
computationally universal circuits allows a unique unification of sampling and
verification, so that they require the same physical resource requirements in
contrast to the more demanding verification protocols seen elsewhere in the

quasi-topological gravity as special cases and possess a number of remarkable
properties: (i) In vacuum, or in the presence of suitable matter, there is a
single independent field equation which is a total derivative. (ii) At the
linearized level, the equations of motion on a maximally symmetric background
are second order, coinciding with the linearized Einstein equations up to a
redefinition of Newton's constant. Therefore, these theories propagate only the
massless, transverse graviton on a maximally symmetric background. (iii) While
the Lovelock and quasi-topological terms are trivial in four dimensions, there
exist four new generalized quasi-topological terms (the quartet) that are
nontrivial, leading to interesting higher curvature theories in $d \geq 4$
dimensions that appear well suited for holographic study. We construct four
dimensional black hole solutions to the theory and study their properties. A
study of black brane solutions in arbitrary dimensions reveals that these
solutions are modified from the `universal' properties these solutions have.

these phenomena in terms of implicit regularization, structural properties of

quantitatively vacuous when applied to networks learned by SGD in this ""deep

nonvacuous bounds. We return to an idea by Langford and Caruana (2001), who
used PAC-Bayes bounds to compute nonvacuous numerical bounds on generalization
error for stochastic two-layer two-hidden-unit neural networks via a
sensitivity analysis. By optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound directly, we are able
to extend their approach and obtain nonvacuous generalization bounds for deep
stochastic neural network classifiers with millions of parameters trained on
only tens of thousands of examples. We connect our findings to recent and old

global properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass, halo mass, age and gas
fraction, in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments
(EAGLE) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The slope of the
correlation between stellar mass and metallicity of star-forming (SF) gas
($M_*-Z_{\rm SF,gas}$ relation) depends somewhat on resolution, with the
higher-resolution run reproducing a steeper slope. This simulation predicts a
non-zero metallicity evolution, increasing by $\approx 0.5$ dex at $\sim 10^9
{\rm M}_{\odot}$ since $z = 3$. The simulated relation between stellar mass,
metallicity and star formation rate at $z \lesssim 5$ agrees remarkably well
with the observed fundamental metallicity relation. At $M_* \lesssim 10^{10.3}
{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and fixed stellar mass, higher metallicities are associated
with lower specific star formation rates, lower gas fractions and older stellar
populations. On the other hand, at higher $M_*$, there is a hint of an
inversion of the dependence of metallicity on these parameters. The fundamental
parameter that best correlates with the metal content, in the simulations, is
the gas fraction. The simulated gas fraction-metallicity relation exhibits
small scatter and does not evolve significantly since $z = 3$. In order to
better understand the origin of these correlations, we analyse a set of lower
resolution simulations in which feedback parameters are varied. We find that
the slope of the simulated $M_*-Z_{\rm SF,gas}$ relation is mostly determined
by stellar feedback at low stellar masses ($M_* \lesssim 10^{10} {\rm

feedback from active galactic nuclei.

explore the role of the local free-fall time (t$_{\rm ff}$) in thermally
unstable cooling. We find that the local cooling time (t$_{\rm cool}$) is as
effective an indicator of cold gas, traced through its nebular emission, as the
ratio of t$_{\rm cool}$/t$_{\rm ff}$. Therefore, t$_{\rm cool}$ alone
apparently governs the onset of thermally unstable cooling in hot atmospheres.
The location of the minimum t$_{\rm cool}$/t$_{\rm ff}$, a thermodynamic
parameter that simulations suggest may be key in driving thermal instability,
is unresolved in most systems. As a consequence, selection effects bias the
value and reduce the observed range in measured t$_{\rm cool}$/t$_{\rm ff}$
minima. The entropy profiles of cool-core clusters are characterized by broken
power-laws down to our resolution limit, with no indication of isentropic
cores. We show, for the first time, that mass isothermality and the $K \propto
r^{2/3}$ entropy profile slope imply a floor in t$_{\rm cool}$/t$_{\rm ff}$
profiles within central galaxies. No significant departures of t$_{\rm
cool}$/t$_{\rm ff}$ below 10 are found, which is inconsistent with many recent
feedback models. The inner densities and cooling times of cluster atmospheres
are resilient to change in response to powerful AGN activity, suggesting that
the energy coupling between AGN heating and atmospheric gas is gentler than
most models predict.

higher-energy cosmic rays leaving the source interact with the magnetized

suggests the possibility that FRBs originate from magnetars, formed by the
unusual supernovae in such galaxies. We investigate this via a comparison of
magnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We
calculate average volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production
channels such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via core-collapse supernovae.
For each channel we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics using
their known properties. We determine for the first time the number density of
FRB emitters (the product of their volumetric birthrate and lifetime), $R_{\rm
FRB}\tau\approx 10^4$Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming that FRBs are predominantly emitted
from repetitive sources similar to FRB 121102 and adopting a beaming factor of
0.1. By comparing rates we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe, GRBs)
implies a typical FRB lifetime of $\approx$30-300 yr, in good agreement with
other lines of argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent
with the available energy stored in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any
relation to magnetars produced via normal core-collapse supernovae leads to a
very short lifetime of $\approx$0.5yr, in conflict with both theory and
observation. We demonstrate that due to the diverse host galaxy distributions
of the different progenitor channels, many possible sources of FRB birth can be
ruled out with $\lesssim 10$ host galaxy identifications. Conversely, targeted
searches of galaxies that have previously hosted decades-old SLSNe and GRBs may
be a fruitful strategy for discovering new FRBs and related quiescent radio
sources, and determining the nature of their progenitors.

where the data distribution can change over time. These changes, referred to as
concept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop
over time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers
need to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts
has traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data
constantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in
detecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult,
costly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change
detection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false
alarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion
of the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process.
In this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm,
which tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier,
as a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent,
application independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental
algorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental
evaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the
cybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect
drifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature
based drift detectors. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts
only when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such,
the MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient
and general in its applicability.

phenomenon corresponds to the stabilization of the Kerr frequency comb
repetition rate. The locking of the second pump, through adiabatic tuning of
its frequency, to the comb generated by the first pump allows transitioning to
single-soliton states, manipulating the position of Kerr solitons in the
cavity, and tuning the frequency comb repetition rate within the locking range.
It also explains soliton crystal formation in resonators supporting a
dispersive wave emitted as a result of higher-order group velocity dispersion
or avoided mode crossing. We show that dichromatic pumping by externally
stabilized pumps can be utilized for stabilization of microresonator-based
optical frequency combs when the comb span does not cover an octave or a

Consequently, many DSLs follow a weak approach using macros or text generators,

Some of these features---e.g., syntax highlighting, type inference, error

deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views
of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in
our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance
metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the
view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance
between the representations of different views of the same object without
compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects,
resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects
within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the
model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category,
independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the
trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained
categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic
objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance
metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels
of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced
during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature
representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match
human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object
persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual
similarity judgment in biological neural networks.

significant demand for high capacity wireless communication with high energy
efficiency. Among technologies to provide the efficiency is full-duplex
wireless communication. Full-duplex wireless enhances capacity by
simultaneously transmitting uplink and downlink data with limited frequency
resources. Previous studies on full-duplex wireless mostly focuses on doubling
the network capacity, whereas in this paper we discuss that full-duplex
wireless can also provide higher energy efficiency. We propose low power
communication by wireless full-duplexing (LPFD), focusing on the fact that the
full-duplex communication duration becomes half of the halfduplex communication
duration. In the LPFD, by using the sleep state in which the transceiver
provided in the wireless communication terminal is turned off, power
consumption of the wireless communication terminal is reduced and energy
efficiency in wireless full duplex is improved. Simulation results show that
the energy efficiency achieved by LPFD is up to approximately 17.3 times higher
than the energy efficiency achieved by existing full-duplex medium access
protocol. Further, it is up to approximately 27.5 times higher than the energy
efficiency using power saving mode of half-duplex communication.

uncertainty decrease much more rapidly when using derivative information.
Moreover, we introduce techniques for overcoming ill-conditioning issues that
have plagued earlier methods for gradient-enhanced Gaussian processes and
kriging. We illustrate the efficacy of these methods using applications to real

exploting derivatives can provide substantial gains over standard methods.

crucial biological information via a multichannel image representation. It is

while $\mathcal{B}$ contains only $(k-1)$-subsets. Moreover, we assume
$\mathcal{A}$ consists of the first $m$ $k$-subsets in squashed
(colexicographic) order, while $\mathcal{B}$ consists of all $(k-1)$-subsets
not contained in the subsets in $\mathcal{A}$. Given reals $\alpha,\beta>0$, we
say the weight of $\mathcal F$ is
$\alpha\cdot|\mathcal{A}|+\beta\cdot|\mathcal{B}|$. We characterize the minimum
weight antichains $\mathcal F$ for any given $n,k,\alpha,\beta$, and we do the
same when in addition $\mathcal F$ is a maximal antichain. We can then derive
asymptotic results on both the minimum size and the minimum Lubell function.

successive contours of 13CO line emission. We find a break in the relation
between sigsfr and siggas, with the relation being power-law (sigsfr ~
siggas^N) with the index N varying between 1.4 and 3.6 above the break. The
siggas at the break is between 150-360 Msun/pc^2 for the sample clouds, which
compares well with the threshold gas density found in recent studies of
Galactic star-forming regions. Our clouds treated as a whole lie between the
Kennicutt (1998) relation and the linear relation for Galactic and
extra-galactic dense star-forming regions. We find a tendency for the high-mass

research was conducted to understand how text tutorials differ from other
tutorials, which tutorial types are preferred and, especially, which tutorial
types yield the best learning experience in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness, especially for programmers. To evaluate these questions, we
converted an existing video tutorial for a novel software tool into a
content-equivalent text tutorial. We then conducted an experiment in three
groups where 42 undergraduate students from a software engineering course were
commissioned to operate the software tool after using a tutorial: the first
group was provided only with the video tutorial, the second group only with the
text tutorial and the third group with both. In this context, the differences
in terms of efficiency were almost negligible: We could observe that
participants using only the text tutorial completed the tutorial faster than
the participants with the video tutorial. However, the participants using only
the video tutorial applied the learned content faster, achieving roughly the
same bottom line performance. We also found that if both tutorial types are
offered, participants prefer video tutorials for learning new content but text
tutorials for looking up ""missed"" information. We mainly gathered our data
through questionnaires and screen recordings and analyzed it with suitable
statistical hypotheses tests. The data is available at [12]. Since producing
tutorials requires effort, knowing with which type of tutorial learnability can
be increased to which extent has an immense practical relevance. We conclude
that in contexts similar to ours, while it would be ideal if software tool
makers would offer both tutorial types, it seems more efficient to produce only
text tutorials instead of a passive video tutorial - provided you manage to
motivate your learners to use them.

typically used to find the metabolites characterizing a phenotype of interest

in a loss of power and the selection of spurious variables. The goal of this
paper is to propose a variable selection procedure in the multivariate linear
model that accounts for the dependence structure of the multiple outputs which
may lead in the LC-MS framework to the selection of more relevant metabolites.
We propose a novel Lasso-based approach in the multivariate framework of the
general linear model taking into account the dependence structure by using
various modelings of the covariance matrix of the residuals. Our numerical
experiments show that including the estimation of the covariance matrix of the
residuals in the Lasso criterion dramatically improves the variable selection
performance. Our approach is also successfully applied to a LC-MS data set made
of African copals samples for which it is able to provide a small list of
metabolites without altering the phenotype discrimination. Our methodology is
implemented in the R package MultiVarSel which is available from the CRAN

quantified principal components from PCA not only allow exploration of
different phases and symmetry-breaking, but can distinguish phase transition
types and locate critical points. We show that the corresponding weight vectors
have a clear physical interpretation, which is particularly interesting in the
frustrated models such as the triangular antiferromagnet, where they can point
to incipient orders. Unlike the other well-studied models, the properties of
the BSI model are less well known. Using both PCA and conventional Monte Carlo
analysis, we demonstrate that the BSI model shows an absence of phase
transition and macroscopic ground-state degeneracy. The failure to capture the
`charge' correlations (vorticity) in the BSI model (XY model) from raw spin
configurations points to some of the limitations of PCA. Finally, we employ a

smaller than abstract specifications that omit many algorithm details. 3.The
simpler specifications led us to easily discover useless replies, unnecessary

specifications, by just following the simplified algorithm flows. 4.The
resulting specifications can be executed directly, and we can express
optimizations cleanly, yielding drastic performance improvement over naive

co-tracking based on the efficient cooperation of two detectors: a rapid
adaptive exemplar-based detector and another more sophisticated but slower
detector with a long-term memory. The sampling labeling and co-learning of the
detectors are conducted by an uncertainty sampling unit, which improves the

$\varepsilon(g,\{s_p,s_q\})$ obtained using only these two views is almost as
good as (i.e. within a small constant factor of) $\varepsilon(g,\mathcal{S})$.
Next, we extend the result to the entire ground plane $\mathcal{G}$ and show
that one can pick a small subset of $\mathcal{S'} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ (which
grows only linearly with the area of $\mathcal{G}$) and still obtain a constant
factor approximation, for every point $g \in \mathcal{G}$, to the minimum worst
case estimate obtained by merging all views in $\mathcal{S}$. Finally, we
present a multi-resolution view selection method which extends our techniques
to non-planar scenes. We show that the method can produce rich and accurate
dense reconstructions with a small number of views. Our results provide a view
selection mechanism with provable performance guarantees which can drastically
increase the speed of scene reconstruction algorithms. In addition to
theoretical results, we demonstrate their effectiveness in an application where
aerial imagery is used for monitoring farms and orchards.

user input, and/or simple scene models, we train an end-to-end deep neural
network that directly regresses a limited field-of-view photo to HDR
illumination, without strong assumptions on scene geometry, material

process: 1) we train a robust lighting classifier to automatically annotate the
location of light sources in a large dataset of LDR environment maps, 2) we use
these annotations to train a deep neural network that predicts the location of
lights in a scene from a single limited field-of-view photo, and 3) we
fine-tune this network using a small dataset of HDR environment maps to predict
light intensities. This allows us to automatically recover high-quality HDR
illumination estimates that significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art
methods. Consequently, using our illumination estimates for applications like
3D object insertion, we can achieve results that are photo-realistic, which is
validated via a perceptual user study.

precession (bSSFP) that jointly reconstructs undersampled data (by a factor of
R) across multiple coils (D) and multiple acquisitions (N). To devise a
multi-acquisition coil compression technique for improved computational
efficiency.
  Methods: The bSSFP image for a given coil and acquisition is modeled to be
modulated by a coil sensitivity and a bSSFP profile. The proposed
reconstruction by calibration over tensors (ReCat) recovers missing data by
tensor interpolation over the coil and acquisition dimensions. Coil compression
is achieved using a new method based on multilinear singular value
decomposition (MLCC). ReCat is compared with iterative self-consistent parallel
imaging (SPIRiT) and profile encoding (PE-SSFP) reconstructions.
  Results: Compared to parallel imaging or profile-encoding methods, ReCat
attains sensitive depiction of high-spatial-frequency information even at
higher R. In the brain, ReCat improves peak SNR (PSNR) by 1.1$\pm$1.0 dB over
SPIRiT and by 0.9$\pm$0.3 dB over PE-SSFP (mean$\pm$std across subjects;
average for N=2-8, R=8-16). Furthermore, reconstructions based on MLCC achieve
0.8$\pm$0.6 dB higher PSNR compared to those based on geometric coil
compression (GCC) (average for N=2-8, R=4-16).
  Conclusion: ReCat is a promising acceleration framework for
banding-artifact-free bSSFP imaging with high image quality; and MLCC offers
improved computational efficiency for tensor-based reconstructions.

  A key innovation of this paper is a concept of ActionTunnel---a 3D virtual

experience as moving into the scene. This connects two distinctive first person
images through similar walking paths. Our method takes a first person image
with a user defined future trajectory and outputs a new image that can afford

  Harvesting",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to
enable low-latency and location-aware data processing at the edge of mobile
networks. Since providing grid power supply in support of MEC can be costly and
even infeasible in some scenarios, on-site renewable energy is mandated as a
major or even sole power supply. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and
unpredictability of energy harvesting creates many new challenges of performing
effective MEC. In this paper, we develop an algorithm called GLOBE that
performs joint geographical load balancing (GLB) and admission control for
optimizing the system performance of a network of MEC-enabled and energy
harvesting-powered base stations. By leveraging and extending the Lyapunov
optimization with perturbation technique, GLOBE operates online without
requiring future system information and addresses significant challenges caused
by battery state dynamics and energy causality constraints. Moreover, GLOBE
works in a distributed manner, which makes our algorithm scalable to large
networks. We prove that GLOBE achieves a close-to-optimal system performance
compared to the offline algorithm that knows full future information, and
present a critical tradeoff between battery capacity and system performance.
Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate the superior
performance of GLOBE compared to benchmark algorithms.

concerned with the situation for which the discretization is required in

known that the multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC) method can improve upon

shows that using our MIMCMC method is preferable, in the sense above, to
i.i.d.~sampling from the most accurate approximation, under assumptions. The

present experimental study dealt with the head-on meeting of two action
potentials (AP) in a single excitable plant cell (Chara braunii internode). The
membrane potential was monitored at the two extremal regions of an excitable
cell. In control experiments, an AP was excited electrically at either end of
the cell cylinder. Subsequently, stimuli were applied simultaneously at both
ends of the cell in order to generate two APs that met each other head-on. When
two action potentials propagated into each other, the pulses did not penetrate
but annihilated (N=26 experiments in n=10 cells). APs in excitable plant cells
did not penetrate upon meeting head-on. In the classical electrical model, this
behavior is specifically attributed to relaxation of ion channel proteins. From
an acoustic point of view, annihilation can be viewed as a result of nonlinear
material properties the entire system. The present results suggest that APs in
excitable animal and plant cells belong to a similar class of nonlinear
phenomena. Intriguingly, other excitation waves in biology (intracellular
waves, cortical spreading depression, etc.) also annihilate upon collision and
are thus expected to follow the same underlying principles as the observed
action potentials.

and broken $\mathcal P*\mathcal T$ symmetry, where $\mathcal P$ stands for
spatial inversion and $\mathcal T$ for time reversal. The generic degeneracies
along symmetry lines are Weyl nodes: Chiral contact points between pairs of
bands. They can be single nodes with a chiral charge of magnitude $|\chi|=1$ or
composite nodes with $|\chi|=2$ or $3$, and the possible $\chi$ values only
depend on the order $n$ of the axis, not on the pitch $m/n$ of the screw.
Double Weyl nodes require $n=4$ or 6, and triple nodes require $n=6$. In all
cases the bands split linearly along the axis, and for composite nodes the
splitting is quadratic on the orthogonal plane. This is true for triple as well
as double nodes, due to the presence in the effective two-band Hamiltonian of a
nonchiral quadratic term that masks the chiral cubic dispersion. If $\mathcal
T$ symmetry is present and $\mathcal P$ is broken there may exist on some
symmetry lines Weyl nodes pinned to $\mathcal T$-invariant momenta, which in
some cases are unavoidable. In the absence of other symmetries their
classification depends on $n$, $m$, and the type of $\mathcal T$ symmetry. With
spinless $\mathcal T$ such $\mathcal T$-invariant Weyl nodes are always double
nodes, while with spinful $\mathcal T$ they can be single or triple nodes.
$\mathcal T$-invariant triples nodes can occur not only on 6-fold axes but also
on 3-fold ones, and their in-plane band splitting is cubic, not quadratic as in
the case of generic triple nodes. These rules are illustrated by means of
first-principles calculations for hcp cobalt, a $\mathcal T$-broken, $\mathcal
P$-invariant crystal with $6_3$ symmetry, and for trigonal tellurium and
hexagonal NbSi$_2$, which are $\mathcal T$-invariant, $\mathcal P$-broken
crystals with 3-fold and 6-fold screw symmetry respectively.

  Measurements","Technical report: 14 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with the non-convex power system state estimation (PSSE)
problem, which plays a central role in the monitoring and operation of electric
power networks. Given a set of noisy measurements, PSSE aims at estimating the
vector of complex voltages at all buses of the network. This is a challenging
task due to the inherent nonlinearity of power flows, for which existing
methods lack guaranteed convergence and theoretical analysis. Motivating by
these limitations, we propose a novel convexification framework for the PSSE
using semidefinite programming (SDP) and second-order cone programming (SOCP)
relaxations. We first study a related power flow (PF) problem as the noiseless
counterpart, which is cast as a constrained minimization program by adding a
suitably designed objective function. We study the performance of the proposed
framework in the case where the set of measurements includes: (i) nodal voltage
magnitudes, and (ii) branch active power flows over a spanning tree of the
network. It is shown that the SDP and SOCP relaxations both recover the true PF
solution as long as the voltage angle difference across each line of the
network is not too large (e.g., less than 90 degrees for lossless networks). By
capitalizing on this result, penalized SDP and SOCP problems are designed to
solve the PSSE, where a penalty based on the weighted least absolute value is
incorporated for fitting noisy measurements with possible bad data. Strong
theoretical results are derived to quantify the optimal solution of the
penalized SDP problem, which is shown to possess a dominant rank-one component
formed by lifting the true voltage vector. An upper bound on the estimation
error is also derived as a function of the noise power, which decreases
exponentially fast as the number of measurements increases.

thickness of the film and its transition temperature to a paraelectric phase
strongly depend on the Bardeen screening length, while the flexocoupling
affects the polarization rotation and closure domain structure and induces
ribbon-like nano-scale domains in the film depth far from the top open surface.
Hence the joint action of the surface screening (originating from e.g. the
adsorption of ambient ions or surface states) and flexocoupling may remarkably
modify polar and electromechanical properties of thin ferroelectric films.

positive values occur for Co in excess on anti-sites (Co$_Z$ or Co$_\text{Ti}$)
and for Ti$_Z$. The most abundant native defects were modeled as dilute alloys,
treated with the coherent potential approximation in combination with the
multiple-scattering theory Green function approach. The self-consistent
potentials determined this way were used to calculate the residual resistivity
via the Kubo-Greenwood formula and, based on its energy dependence, the Seebeck
coefficient of the systems. The latter is shown to depend significantly on the
type of defect, leading to variations that are related to subtle, spin-orbit
coupling induced, changes in the electronic structure above the half-metallic
gap. Two of the systems, Vc$_\text{Co}$ and Co$_Z$, are found to exhibit a
negative Seebeck coefficient. This observation, together with their low
formation energy, offers an explanation for the experimentally observed
negative Seebeck coefficient of the Co$_2$Ti$Z$ compounds as being due to
unintentionally created native defects.

pseudo-spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which emerges from the linear many-body
Schr\""odinger equation at the leading order in the number of particles. The
considered system is a three-dimensional diluted gas of identical bosons with
spin, possibly confined in space, and coupled with an external time-dependent
magnetic field; particles also interact among themselves through a short-scale
repulsive interaction. The limit of infinitely many particles is monitored in
the physically relevant Gross-Pitaevskii scaling. In our main theorem, if at
time zero the system is in a phase of complete condensation (at the level of
the reduced one-body marginal) and with energy per particle fixed by the
Gross-Pitaevskii functional, then such conditions persist also at later times,
with the one-body orbital of the condensate evolving according to a system of
non-linear cubic Schr\""odinger equations coupled among themselves through
linear (Rabi) terms. The proof relies on an adaptation to the spinor setting of
Pickl's projection counting method developed for the scalar case. Quantitative
rates of convergence are available, but not made explicit because evidently
non-optimal. In order to substantiate the formalism and the assumptions made in
the main theorem, in an introductory section we review the mathematical
formalisation of modern typical experiments with pseudo-spinor condensates.

boundary integral equation method is developed for efficient numerical
determination of these modes in the presence of multiple localized defects for
a wide range of two-dimensional geometries. The defects result in
eigenfunctions with a weak singularity that is resolved by decomposing the
solution as a superposition of Green's functions plus a smooth regular part.
This method is applied to a variety of regular and irregular domains and two
key phenomena are observed. First, careful placement of clamping points can
entirely eliminate particular eigenvalues and suggests a strategy for
manipulating the vibrational characteristics of rigid bodies so that
undesirable frequencies are removed. Second, clamping of the plate can result
in partitioning of the domain so that vibrational modes are largely confined to
certain spatial regions. This numerical method gives a precision tool for
tuning the vibrational characteristics of thin elastic plates.

cellular base stations, mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) has been
regarded as a promising means to accomplish the ambitious millisecond-scale
end-to-end latency requirement of the fifth-generation networks. In this paper,
we investigate the latency-minimization problem in a multi-user time-division
multiple access MECO system with joint communication and computation resource
allocation. Three different computation models are studied, i.e., local
compression, edge cloud compression, and partial compression offloading. First,
closed-form expressions of optimal resource allocation and minimum system delay
for both local and edge cloud compression models are derived. Then, for the
partial compression offloading model, we formulate a piecewise optimization
problem and prove that the optimal data segmentation strategy has a piecewise
structure. Based on this result, an optimal joint communication and computation
resource allocation algorithm is developed. To gain more insights, we also
analyze a specific scenario where communication resource is adequate while
computation resource is limited. In this special case, the closed-form solution
of the piecewise optimization problem can be derived. Our proposed algorithms
are finally verified by numerical results, which show that the novel partial
compression offloading model can significantly reduce the end-to-end latency.

discussion on the nature of the accreting neutron star. In most of the previous
studies the magnetic field of the neutron star was derived from the observed
spin-up/down rates based on the standard thin, magnetized accretion disk model.
However, under super-Eddington accretion the inner part of the accretion disk
becomes geometrically thick. In this work we consider both radiation feedback
from the neutron star and the sub-Keplerian rotation in a thick disk, and
calculate the magnetic moment - mass accretion rate relations for the measured
rates of spin change. We find that the derived neutron star's dipole magnetic
field depends the maximum accretion rate adopted, but is likely $\lesssim
10^{13}$ G. The predicted accretion rate change can be used to test the
proposed models by comparison with observations.

programs to prevent cancer. Cervical cancer incidence has significantly
decreased in countries that developed systems for organized screening engaging
medical practitioners, laboratories and patients. The system automatically
identifies individuals at risk of developing the disease and invites them for a
screening exam or a follow-up exam conducted by medical professionals. A triage
algorithm in the system aims to reduce unnecessary screening exams for
individuals at low-risk while detecting and treating individuals at high-risk.
Despite the general success of screening, the triage algorithm is a
one-size-fits all approach that is not personalized to a patient. This can
easily be observed in historical data from screening exams. Often patients rely
on personal factors to determine that they are either at high risk or not at
risk at all and take action at their own discretion. Can exploring patient
trajectories help hypothesize personal factors leading to their decisions? We
present Portinari, a data exploration tool to query and visualize future
trajectories of patients who have undergone a specific sequence of screening
exams. The web-based tool contains (a) a visual query interface (b) a backend
graph database of events in patients' lives (c) trajectory visualization using
sankey diagrams. We use Portinari to explore diverse trajectories of patients
following the Norwegian triage algorithm. The trajectories demonstrated
variable degrees of adherence to the triage algorithm and allowed
epidemiologists to hypothesize about the possible causes.

We show that it converges almost surely, uniformly in time, with a rate of
convergence of order 1/4 and propose an estimation of the error. We then extend
the well known Feynman- Kac formula which gives a probabilistic representation
of partial differential equations (PDEs), to its higher order version using
iterated processes. In particular we consider general position processes which
are not necessarily Markovian or are indexed by the real line but real valued.
We also weaken some assumptions from previous works. We show that intertwining
diffusions are related to transformations of high order PDEs. Combining our
numerical scheme with the Feynman-Kac formula, we simulate functionals of the
trajectories and solutions to fourth order PDEs that are naturally associated
to a general class of iterated processes.

a stranded planetary embryo that never became a fully-grown planet. A currently
popular planet formation theory predicts that Mars formed near Earth and Venus
and was subsequently scattered outwards to its present location. In such a
scenario, the compositions of the three planets are expected to be similar to
each other. However, bulk elemental and isotopic data for martian meteorites
demonstrate that key aspects of Mars' composition are markedly different from
that of Earth. This suggests that Mars formed outside of the terrestrial
feeding zone during primary accretion. It is therefore probable that Mars
always remained significantly farther from the Sun than Earth; its growth was
stunted early and its mass remained relatively low. Here we identify a
potential dynamical pathway that forms Mars in the asteroid belt and keeps it
outside of Earth's accretion zone while at the same time accounting for strict
age and compositional constraints, as well as mass differences. Our uncommon
pathway (approximately 2% probability) is based on the Grand Tack scenario of
terrestrial planet formation, in which the radial migration by Jupiter
gravitationally sculpts the planetesimal disc at Mars' current location. We
conclude that Mars' formation requires a specific dynamical pathway, while this
is less valid for Earth and Venus. We further predict that} Mars' volatile
budget is most likely different from Earth's and that Venus formed close enough
to our planet that it is expected to have a nearly identical composition from
common building blocks.

$R$-module. In this paper, we introduce the notion of $(\sigma,\delta)$-skew
McCoy modules which extends the notion of McCoy modules and $\sigma$-skew McCoy
modules. This concept can be regarded also as a generalization of
$(\sigma,\delta)$-skew Armendariz modules. Some properties of this concept are
established and some connections between $(\sigma,\delta)$-skew McCoyness and
$(\sigma,\delta)$-compatible reduced modules are examined. Also, we study the
property $(\sigma,\delta)$-skew McCoy of some skew triangular matrix extensions
$V_n(M,\sigma)$, for any nonnegative integer $n\geq 2$. As a consequence, we
obtain: (1) $M_R$ is $(\sigma,\delta)$-skew McCoy if and only if
$M[x]/M[x](x^n)$ is $(\overline{\sigma},\overline{\delta})$-skew McCoy, and (2)
$M_R$ is $\sigma$-skew McCoy if and only if $M[x;\sigma]/M[x;\sigma](x^n)$ is

  and Hockey","26 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the sports of soccer, hockey and basketball the most commonly used
statistics for player performance assessment are divided into two categories:
offensive statistics and defensive statistics. However, qualitative assessments
of playmaking (for example making ""smart"" passes) are difficult to quantify. It
would be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize
the flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to
successful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's
PageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but
here we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams
that emphasizes initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing
defensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a
node for each of the n players who play in the game and a ""goal node"". Arcs
between player nodes indicate sport-specific situations (including passes,
turnovers, scoring, fouls, out-of-bounds, play-stoppages, turnovers, missed
shots, defensive plays etc.), tailored for each sport. As well, some additional
arcs are added in to ensure that the associated matrix is primitive and hence
there is a unique PageRank vector. The PageRank vector of the associated matrix
is used to rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was
taken from nine NBA games played between 2014-2016. Many of the top-ranked
players (in the model) in a given game had some of the most impressive
traditional stat-lines. However, from the model there were surprises where some
players who had impressive stat-lines had lower ranks, and others who had less
impressive stat-lines had higher ranks. Overall, the model's ranking and
ratings reflect more the flow of the game compared to traditional sports
statistics.

strange forms as reported originally by ancient seers such as Parashara,

king of gods, went into hiding. Nahusha became luminous and egoistic after
absorbing radiance from gods and seers. When he kicked Agastya (southern star
Canopus), the latter cursed him to become a serpent and fall from the sky. We
posit arguments to surmise that this Mahabharata lore is a mythical recounting
of a cometary event wherein a comet crossed Ursa Major, moved southwards with
an elongated tail in the direction of Canopus and eventually went out of sight.

both in applicative and basic fields of research, thanks to its outstanding
properties of adsorption and catalysis but also because it is a reference
material for the study of many general properties of MOFs. Its metallic group
comprises a pair of Cu2+ ions chelated by four carboxylate bridges, forming a
structure known as paddle-wheel unit, which is the heart of the material.
However, previous studies have well established that the paddle-wheel is
incline to hydrolysis. In fact, the prolonged exposure of the material to
moisture promotes the hydrolysis of Cu-O bonds in the paddle-wheels, so
breaking the crystalline network. The main objective of the present
experimental investigation is the determination of the details of the
structural defects induced by this process in the crystal and it has been
successfully pursued by coupling the electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy with other more commonly considered techniques, as X-ray
diffraction, surface area estimation and scanning electron microscopy. Thanks
to this original approach we have recognized three stages of the process of
decomposition of HKUST-1 and we have unveiled the details of the corresponding
equilibrium structures of the paddle-wheels at the atomic scale level.

dominant retarded dispersion relations of a single ring for comparison, discuss
mode complementarity and hybridization, and introduce two new types of toroidal

silicon ring. A generalized Green's function is obtained for multilayer tori

Employing the Green's function, the scalar electric potential distribution

VLBI measurements with those obtained from pulsar timing data from the Nanshan

find that the timing positions differ significantly from the VLBI positions

change in the obliquity of the ecliptic of $2.16\pm0.33$\,mas is found for the
JPL ephemeris DE405, but no significant rotation is found in subsequent JPL
ephemerides. The accuracy with which we can relate the two frames is limited by
the current uncertainties in the VLBI reference source positions and in
matching the pulsars to their reference source. Not only do the timing
positions depend on the ephemeris used in computing them, but also different
segments of the timing data lead to varying position estimates. These
variations are mostly common to all ephemerides, but slight changes are seen at
