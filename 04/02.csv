precise tests of Standard Model (SM) predictions. Neutron decay is free of
nuclear structure corrections present in nuclear beta decays, and, with a
$10^8$ times larger branching ratio than the theoretically cleaner pion beta
decay, it is more readily accessible to experimental study than the latter.
Measurements at sufficient precision of the neutron lifetime, and of
correlations in free neutron beta decay, offer several stringent tests of the
SM, including the weak quark couplings (quark-lepton universality), and certain
extensions beyond the standard $V-A$ weak interaction theory. This paper
focuses on the long-running free neutron beta decay experimental program aimed
at obtaining an independent determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) mixing matrix element $V_{ud}$. We discuss the present state of precision
achieved in this program and briefly review the currently active projects, as
well as the expected near-term improvements in the field.

linear convergence up to a certain region including the optimal set, with error
of the order of the stepsize. Second, if appropriate problem parameters are

the several, high-profile, ""comebacks"" that were observed in almost all sports.
The Cavaliers won the championship after being down 3-1 in the 2016 NBA finals'
series against the Golden State Warriors, which was exactly the case for
Chicago Cubs and the World Series. The Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2016 even
though they were trailing by 25 points late in the third quarter, while FC
Barcelona in the top-16 round of the 2016-17 Champions League scored 3 goals
during the last 7 minutes of the game (including stoppage time) against PSG to
advance in the tournament. This has brought the robustness and accuracy of the
various probabilistic prediction models under high scrutiny. Many of these
models are proprietary, which makes it hard to evaluate. In this paper, we
build a simple and open, yet robust and well-calibrated, in-game probability
model for predicting the winner in an NFL (iWinRNFL) game. In particular, we
build a logistic regression model that utilizes a set of 10 variables to
predict the running win probability for the home team. We train our model using
detailed play-by-play data from the last 7 NFL seasons obtained through the
league's API. Our results indicate that in 75% of the cases iWinRNFL provides
an accurate winner projection, as compared to a 63% accuracy of a baseline
pre-game win probability model. Most importantly the probabilities that
iWinRNFL provides are well-calibrated. Finally, we have also evaluated more
complex, non-linear, models using the same set of features, without any
significant improvement in performance.

significantly reduced sensitivity to the variation of the electrical
conductivity of a liquid metal. A simple theoretical model of the flowmeter is
considered where the flow is approximated by a solid finite-thickness
conducting layer which moves in the presence of an ac magnetic field. In
contrast to the original design [Priede et al., Meas. Sci. Technol. 22 (2011)
055402], where the flow rate is determined by measuring only the phase shift
between the voltages induced in two receiving coils, the improved design
measures also the phase shift between the sending and the upstream receiving
coils. These two phase shifts are referred to as internal and external ones,
respectively. We show that the effect of electrical conductivity on the
internal phase shift, which is induced by the flow, can be strongly reduced by
rescaling it with the external phase shift, which depends mostly on the
conductivity of medium. Two different rescalings are found depending on the ac
frequency. At low frequencies, when the shielding effect is weak, the effect of
conductivity is strongly reduced by rescaling the internal phase shift with the
external one squared. At higher frequencies, the same is achieved by rescaling
the internal phase shift directly with the external one.

been limited primarily due to the lack of availability of large-scale, open

multimodal, domain-aware conversations, and propose the MMD benchmark dataset.
This dataset was gathered by working in close coordination with large number of
domain experts in the retail domain. These experts suggested various
conversations flows and dialog states which are typically seen in multimodal
conversations in the fashion domain. Keeping these flows and states in mind, we
created a dataset consisting of over 150K conversation sessions between
shoppers and sales agents, with the help of in-house annotators using a
semi-automated manually intense iterative process. With this dataset, we
propose 5 new sub-tasks for multimodal conversations along with their
evaluation methodology. We also propose two multimodal neural models in the
encode-attend-decode paradigm and demonstrate their performance on two of the
sub-tasks, namely text response generation and best image response selection.
These experiments serve to establish baseline performance and open new research
directions for each of these sub-tasks. Further, for each of the sub-tasks, we
present a `per-state evaluation' of 9 most significant dialog states, which
would enable more focused research into understanding the challenges and
complexities involved in each of these states.

accurate telescopes than those exist today. In this work, we propose a method
based on relationship between the transit timing variation (TTV) and the

help of a numerical simulation of the Earth-Moon system transits, we have
constructed data on the BF and the TTV for any configuration of an individual
transit. The experimental charts obtained indicate an easily detectable near
linear dependence. Even with an artificial increase in orbital speed of the
Moon and high-level errors in measurements the patterns suggest an accurate
correlation. A significant advantage of the method is its convenience for
multiple moons systems due to an additive properties of the TTV and the BF. Its
also important that mean motion resonance (MMR) in system have no affect on
ability of satellites detection. At the end we tried to retrieve parameters of
the Moon (without additional satellites) on the basis of the simulated
photometric curves. The results perform errors at the level of $\approx 0.45$

generation, which makes it impossible to use for stochastic modeling processes.

for generation a sequence of uniformly distributed pseudo random numbers and
quality assessment of the sequence given by them, as well as the ways to
implement some of these algorithms in OpenModelica system. Methods: All the
algorithms are implemented in C language, and the results of their work tested
using open source package DieHarder. For those algorithms that do not use bit
operations, we describe there realisation using OpwnModelica. The other
algorithms can be called in OpenModelica as C functions Results: We have
implemented and tested about nine algorithms. DieHarder testing revealed the
highest quality pseudo-random number generators. Also we have reviewed

piezoelectric substrate. The phonon-drag contribution S^g_PA from the extrinsic
potential of piezoelectric surface acoustic (PA) phonons of a piezoelectric
substrate (GaAs) is calculated as a function of temperature T and electron
concentration n_s. At very low temperature, S^g_PA is found to be much greater
than S^g_DA of the intrinsic deformation potential of acoustic (DA) phonons of

  interventions",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most work in causal inference considers deterministic interventions that set
each unit's treatment to some fixed value. However, under positivity violations
these interventions can lead to non-identification, inefficiency, and effects
with little practical relevance. Further, corresponding effects in longitudinal
studies are highly sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, resulting in
widespread use of unrealistic parametric models. We propose a novel solution to
these problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values
rather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have
several crucial advantages. First, they avoid positivity assumptions entirely.
Second, they require no parametric assumptions and yet still admit a simple
characterization of longitudinal effects, independent of the number of
timepoints. For example, they allow longitudinal effects to be visualized with
a single curve instead of lists of coefficients. After characterizing these
incremental interventions and giving identifying conditions for corresponding
effects, we also develop general efficiency theory, propose efficient
nonparametric estimators that can attain fast convergence rates even when
incorporating flexible machine learning, and propose a bootstrap-based
confidence band and simultaneous test of no treatment effect. Finally we
explore finite-sample performance via simulation, and apply the methods to
study time-varying sociological effects of incarceration on entry into
marriage.

polarization in the CMB is predicted to be very small, experimental limits
provide a valuable test of the underlying models. By exploiting the non-zero
circular-to-linear polarization coupling of the HWP polarization modulators,
data from SPIDER's 2015 Antarctic flight provide a constraint on Stokes $V$ at
95 and 150 GHz from $33<\ell<307$. No other limits exist over this full range
of angular scales, and SPIDER improves upon the previous limit by several
orders of magnitude, providing 95% C.L. constraints on $\ell

denoted $\mathcal{H}_3$, is the triangle-free analogue of the Rado graph. While
the Ramsey theory of the Rado graph has been completely established, beginning
with Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal-Pos\'{a} and culminating in work of Sauer and
Laflamme-Sauer-Vuksanovic, the Ramsey theory of $\mathcal{H}_3$ had only
progressed to bounds for vertex colorings (Komj\'{a}th-R\""{o}dl) and edge
colorings (Sauer). This was due to a lack of broadscale techniques. We solve
this problem in general: For each finite triangle-free graph $G$, there is a
finite number $T(G)$ such that for any coloring of all copies of $G$ in
$\mathcal{H}_3$ into finitely many colors, there is a subgraph of
$\mathcal{H}_3$ which is again universal homogeneous triangle-free in which the
coloring takes no more than $T(G)$ colors. This is the first such result for a
homogeneous structure omitting copies of some non-trivial finite structure. The
proof entails developments of new broadscale techniques, including a flexible
method for constructing trees which code $\mathcal{H}_3$ and the development of
their Ramsey theory.

maxmin share paradigm introduced by Budish as a measure for fairness. Procaccia
and Wang (EC'14) were first to investigate this fundamental problem in the
additive setting. In contrast to what real-world experiments suggest, they show
that a maxmin guarantee (1-MMS allocation) is not always possible even when the
number of agents is limited to 3. While the existence of an approximation
solution (e.g. a $1/2$-MMS allocation) is quite straightforward, improving the
guarantee becomes subtler for larger constants. Procaccia provide a proof for
existence of a $2/3$-MMS allocation and leave the question open for better
guarantees.
  Our main contribution is an answer to the above question. We improve the
result of [Procaccia and Wang] to a $3/4$ factor in the additive setting. The
main idea for our $3/4$-MMS allocation method is clustering the agents. To this
end, we introduce three notions and techniques, namely reducibility, matching
allocation, and cycle-envy-freeness, and prove the approximation guarantee of
our algorithm via non-trivial applications of these techniques. Our analysis
involves coloring and double counting arguments that might be of independent
interest.
  One major shortcoming of the current studies on fair allocation is the
additivity assumption on the valuations. We alleviate this by extending our
results to the case of submodular, fractionally subadditive, and subadditive
settings. More precisely, we give constant approximation guarantees for
submodular and XOS agents, and a logarithmic approximation for the case of
subadditive agents. Furthermore, we complement our results by providing close
upper bounds for each class of valuation functions. Finally, we present
algorithms to find such allocations for additive, submodular, and XOS settings
in polynomial time.

users seek to find model inputs that maximize the expected value of an
objective function. The objective function, however, is time-intensive to
evaluate, and cannot be directly measured. Instead, the stochastic nature of
the model means that individual realizations are corrupted by noise. More
formally, we consider the problem of optimizing the expected value of an
expensive black-box function with continuously-differentiable mean, from which
observations are corrupted by Gaussian noise. We present Parallel Simultaneous
Perturbation Optimization (PSPO), which extends a well-known stochastic
optimization algorithm, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation, in
several important ways. Our modifications allow the algorithm to fully take
advantage of parallel computing resources, like high-performance cloud
computing. The resulting PSPO algorithm takes fewer time-consuming iterations
to converge, automatically chooses the step size, and can vary the error
tolerance by step. Theoretical results are supported by a numerical example. To
demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, we implemented the algorithm to
maximize the pseudo-likelihood of a stochastic epidemiological model to data of

signals is getting popularity because of construction simplicity and low cost
of wearable devices. The task becomes very difficult due to the presence of
various motion artifacts. The objective is to develop algorithms to reduce the
effect of motion artifacts and thus obtain accurate heart rate estimation.
Methods- Proposed heart rate estimation scheme utilizes both time and frequency
domain analyses. Unlike conventional single stage adaptive filter, multi-stage
cascaded adaptive filtering is introduced by using three channel accelerometer
data to reduce the effect of motion artifacts. Both recursive least squares
(RLS) and least mean squares (LMS) adaptive filters are tested. Moreover,
singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is employed to obtain improved spectral peak
tracking. The outputs from the filter block and SSA operation are logically
combined and used for spectral domain heart rate estimation. Finally, a
tracking algorithm is incorporated considering neighbouring estimates. Results-
The proposed method provides an average absolute error of 1.16 beat per minute
(BPM) with a standard deviation of 1.74 BPM while tested on publicly available
database consisting of recordings from 12 subjects during physical activities.
Conclusion- It is found that the proposed method provides consistently better
heart rate estimation performance in comparison to that recently reported by
TROIKA, JOSS and SPECTRAP methods. Significance- The proposed method offers
very low estimation error and a smooth heart rate tracking with simple
algorithmic approach and thus feasible for implementing in wearable devices to
monitor heart rate for fitness and clinical purpose.

polymer matrix. As a consequence, their structural and rheological properties
are governed by a competition between magnetic particle-particle interactions
and mechanical matrix elasticity. Typically, the particles are permanently
fixed within the matrix, which makes them distinguishable by their positions.
Over time, particle neighbors do not change due to the fixation by the matrix.
Here we present a classical density functional approach for such ferrogels. We
map the elastic matrix-induced interactions between neighboring colloidal
particles distinguishable by their positions onto effective pairwise
interactions between indistinguishable particles similar to a ""pairwise
pseudopotential"". Using Monte-Carlo computer simulations, we demonstrate for
one-dimensional dipole-spring models of ferrogels that this mapping is
justified. We then use the pseudopotential as an input into classical density
functional theory of inhomogeneous fluids and predict the bulk elastic modulus
of the ferrogel under various conditions. In addition, we propose the use of an
""external pseudopotential"" when one switches from the viewpoint of a
one-dimensional dipole-spring object to a one-dimensional chain embedded in an
infinitely extended bulk matrix. Our mapping approach paves the way to describe
various inhomogeneous situations of ferrogels using classical density

targeted subsample probes low-luminosity, late-type galaxies at $z<0.02$ with
small impact parameters ($\langle\rho\rangle = 71$ kpc), and the serendipitous
subsample probes higher luminosity galaxies at $z\lesssim0.2$ with larger
impact parameters ($\langle\rho\rangle = 222$ kpc). HST and FUSE UV
spectroscopy of the absorbers and basic data for the associated galaxies,
derived from ground-based imaging and spectroscopy, are presented. We find
broad agreement with the COS-Halos results, but our sample shows no evidence
for changing ionization parameter or hydrogen density with distance from the
CGM host galaxy, probably because the COS-Halos survey probes the CGM at
smaller impact parameters. We find at least two passive galaxies with H I and
metal-line absorption, confirming the intriguing COS-Halos result that galaxies
sometimes have cool gas halos despite no on-going star formation. Using a new
methodology for fitting H I absorption complexes, we confirm the CGM cool gas
mass of Paper 1, but this value is significantly smaller than found by the
COS-Halos survey. We trace much of this difference to the specific values of
the low-$z$ meta-galactic ionization rate assumed. After accounting for this
difference, a best-value for the CGM cool gas mass is found by combining the
results of both surveys to obtain $\log{(M/M_{\odot})}=10.5\pm0.3$, or ~30% of
the total baryon reservoir of an $L \geq L^*$, star-forming galaxy.

Here, we show that an analogous quantum clustering phenomenon takes place in

involves extending the notion of clustering to Hilbert space, where the
classical Hamming distance is not immediately useful. Quantum clusters
correspond to macroscopically distinct subspaces of the full quantum ground
state space which grow with the system size. We explicitly demonstrate that
such clusters arise in the solution space of random quantum satisfiability

performed on metastable states that are produced from neutral gas particles and
ions in other electronic states. If the laser intensity is increased to obtain
a better LIF signal, then optical pumping can produce systematic effects
depending on the collision rates which control metastable population and
lifetime. We numerically simulate the ion velocity distribution measurement and
wave-detection process using a Lagrangian model for the LIF signal for the case
where metastables are produced directly from neutrals. This case requires more
strict precautions and is important for discharges with energetic primary
electrons and a high density of neutrals. Some of the results also apply to
metastables produced from pre-existing ions. The simulations show that optical
pumping broadening affects the ion velocity distribution function (IVDF)
$f_0(v)$ and its first-order perturbation $f_1(v,t)$ when laser intensity is
increased above a certain level. The results also suggest that ion temperature
measurements are only accurate when the metastable ions can live longer than
the ion-ion collision mean free time. For the purposes of wave detection, the
wave period has to be significantly shorter than the lifetime of metastable
ions for a direct interpretation. It is more generally true that metastable
ions may be viewed as test-particles. As long as an appropriate model is
available, LIF can be extended to a range of environments.

this paper, we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Convolutional
Neural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This
novel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images, and learn from both
fined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously. To enable
training on these hybrid inputs, we extend the method by developing a dedicated
double-subnet neural network structure, i.e. a Multi-Patch subnet and a
Layout-Aware subnet. We further construct an aggregation layer to effectively
combine the hybrid features from these two subnets. Extensive experiments on
the large-scale aesthetics assessment benchmark (AVA) demonstrate significant
performance improvement over the state-of-the-art in photo aesthetic
assessment.

of private information retrieval (PIR). In this paper we study the problem of

first prove an upper bound on the capacity of PMFR schemes which indicates the
minimum possible download size per unit of retrieved files. Then we design a
general PMFR scheme which happens to attain the upper bound when
$r\geq\frac{M}{2}$, thus achieving the optimal communication cost. As $r$ goes
down we show the trivial approach of executing $r$ independent PIR instances

capacity-achieving PIR schemes, our PMFR scheme reduces the number of
subpackages needed for each file from $N^M$ to $N^2$, which implies a great
reduction of implementation complexity.

by linking local maxima of the lensing signal to the mass function. Recent
applications to data have already been numerous and fruitful. However, the
importance of understanding and dealing with systematics increases as data
quality reaches an unprecedented level. One of the sources of systematics is
the convergence-shear inversion. This effect, inevitable when carrying out a
convergence field from observations, is usually neglected by theoretical peak
models. Thus, it could have an impact on cosmological results. In this paper,
we study the bias from neglecting (mis-modeling) the inversion. Our tests show
a small but non-negligible bias. The cosmological dependence of this bias seems
to be related to the parameter Sigma_8. When this bias propagates to the
parameter estimation, we discovered that constraint contours involving the dark
energy equation of state can differ by 2-sigma. Such an effect can be even
larger for future high-precision surveys and we argue that the inversion should
be properly modeled for theoretical peak models.

describing Streicher and Reus's denotational model of continuations in the

provides at the same time an interpretation of the type system and a proof of
the completeness of the system with respect to the continuation models by means
of a filter model construction. We then define a restriction of our system,
such that a lambda-mu term is typeable if and only if it is strongly
normalising. We also show that Parigot's typing of lambda-mu terms with
classically valid propositional formulas can be translated into the restricted
system, which then provides an alternative proof of strong normalisability for
the typed lambda-mu calculus.

velocity using a mean field theory for multiband superconductivity. This
roadmap is motivated by compelling experimental evidence for one component in
the proximity of a Lifshitz transition in cuprates, diborides and iron based

the two electron fluids, we search for the optimum coupling strength in the
electronic polaronic component which gives the largest amplification of the
superconducting critical temperature in comparison with the case of a single

autonomous vehicles is mainly driven by two factors: (1) increasingly
sophisticated algorithms that interpret the environment around the vehicle and
react accordingly, and (2) the continuous improvements of sensor technology
itself. In terms of cameras, these improvements typically include higher
spatial resolution, which as a consequence requires more data to be processed.
The trend to add multiple cameras to cover the entire surrounding of the
vehicle is not conducive in that matter. At the same time, an increasing number
of special purpose algorithms need access to the sensor input data to correctly
interpret the various complex situations that can occur, particularly in urban
traffic.
  By observing those trends, it becomes clear that a key challenge for vision
architectures in intelligent vehicles is to share computational resources. We
believe this challenge should be faced by introducing a representation of the
sensory data that provides compressed and structured access to all relevant
visual content of the scene. The Stixel World discussed in this paper is such a
representation. It is a medium-level model of the environment that is
specifically designed to compress information about obstacles by leveraging the
typical layout of outdoor traffic scenes. It has proven useful for a multitude
of automotive vision applications, including object detection, tracking,
segmentation, and mapping.
  In this paper, we summarize the ideas behind the model and generalize it to
take into account multiple dense input streams: the image itself, stereo depth
maps, and semantic class probability maps that can be generated, e.g., by CNNs.
Our generalization is embedded into a novel mathematical formulation for the
Stixel model. We further sketch how the free parameters of the model can be
learned using structured SVMs.

luminosity slowly decayed. We used XMM-Newton to observe the system during this

almost measure-preserving bijection between large parts of $X^{\otimes n}$ and
$Y^{\otimes n}$. In this way, $X$ and $Y$ are asymptotically equivalent.
  It turns out to be challenging to generalize this notion of asymptotic
equivalence to configurations of probability spaces, which are collections of
probability spaces with measure-preserving maps between some of them.
  In this article we introduce the intrinsic Kolmogorov-Sinai distance on the
space of configurations of probability spaces. Concentrating on the large-scale
geometry we pass to the asymptotic Kolmogorov-Sinai distance. It induces an
asymptotic equivalence relation on sequences of configurations of probability
spaces. We will call the equivalence classes \emph{tropical probability
spaces}.
  In this context we prove an Asymptotic Equipartition Property for
configurations. It states that tropical configurations can always be
approximated by homogeneous configurations. In addition, we show that the
solutions to certain Information-Optimization problems are
Lipschitz-con\-tinuous with respect to the asymptotic Kolmogorov-Sinai
distance. It follows from these two statements that in order to solve an
Information-Optimization problem, it suffices to consider homogeneous
configurations.
  Finally, we show that spaces of trajectories of length $n$ of certain
stochastic processes, in particular stationary Markov chains, have a tropical
limit.

by many as a catastrophic regime shift, since the positive feedback of
vegetation density on growth rates yields a system that admits alternative
steady states. Some support to this idea comes from the analysis of static
patterns, where peaks of the vegetation density histogram were associated with
these alternative states. Here we present a large-scale empirical study of
vegetation dynamics, aimed at identifying and quantifying directly the effects
of positive feedback. To do that, we have analyzed vegetation density across
$~2.5 \times 10^6 \ \rm{km}^2$ of the African Sahel region, with spatial
resolution of $30 \times 30$ meters, using three consecutive snapshots. The
results are mixed. The local vegetation density (measured at a single pixel)
moves towards the average of the corresponding rainfall line, indicating a
purely negative feedback. On the other hand, the chance of spatial clusters (of
many ""green"" pixels) to expand in the next census is growing with their size,
suggesting some positive feedback. We show that these apparently contradicting
results emerge naturally in a model with positive feedback and strong
demographic stochasticity, a model that allows for a catastrophic shift only in
a certain range of parameters. Static patterns, like the double peak in the
histogram of vegetation density, are shown to vary between censuses, with no
apparent correlation with the actual dynamical features.

including measurements of the positron fraction, electron and positron spectra
and inclusive electron+positron data. Precision measurements by PAMELA and
AMS-02 of the positron spectrum and its striking difference from the electron
spectrum have prompted several theoretical speculations. In order to
discriminate among different interpretations of the 'positron anomaly', a major
step is needed to achieve an accurate direct measurement of the shape of the
inclusive electron spectrum beyond 1 TeV. Ongoing efforts along this direction
by instruments already in orbit and by the recently launched CALET and DAMPE
missions are described. A challenging experimental scenario, at variance with
the standard paradigm of a single power law spectrum, emerges for the
cosmic-ray charged hadrons after the discovery of a discrepant hardening in the
rigidity spectra of protons and He in the 200 to 300 GV region (CREAM, PAMELA,
AMS-02) and the observation by AMS-02 of a possible break in the Li spectrum.
An additional puzzle comes from the apparent violation of the universality of
spectral indices whereby He and proton spectra are progressively hardening
above ~100 GV with a similar rigidity dependence, but the He spectrum is harder
than proton's. Secondary-to-primary ratios and isotope flux ratios provide
insight into the subtleties of propagation mechanism(s) and test the internal
consistency of the models of acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the
galaxy. Important complementary information on the abundance of nuclei heavier
than iron comes from dedicated balloon-borne instruments as SuperTIGER or
space-based missions as ACE at L1 that provided the first measurement of a
primary ""cosmic-ray clock"". A brief overview of future missions is given at the
end of the paper.

equilibrium topological phases exist, which are characterised by a Chern

show that optical lattices prove to be a good candidate for both its

Here, we scrutinize the temperature dependence of the ISFE of Au through
accurate first-principles derived Helmholtz free energies employing both the
super cell approach and the axial Ising model (AIM). A significant decrease of
the ISFE with temperature, $-(36$-$39)$\,\% from 0 to 890\,K depending on the
treatment of thermal expansion, is revealed, which matches the estimate based
on the experimental temperature coefficient $d \gamma / d T $ closely. We make
evident that this decrease predominantly originates from the excess vibrational
entropy at the stacking fault layer, although the contribution arising from the
static lattice expansion compensates it by approximately 60\,\%. Electronic
excitations are found to be of minor importance for the ISFE change with
temperature. We show that the Debye model in combination with the AIM captures
the correct sign but significantly underestimates the magnitude of the
vibrational contribution to $\gamma(T)$. The hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and
double hcp structures are established as metastable phases of Au. Our results
demonstrate that quantitative agreement with experiments can be obtained if all
relevant temperature-induced excitations are considered in first-principles
modeling and that the temperature dependence of the ISFE is substantial enough

Despite its relevance, statistical procedures for measuring the significance of

central limit theorem for conducting statistical inference for the
cross-covariance operator estimated between two stationary, weakly dependent,

that two series possess a specified cross-covariance structure at a given lag.
Since this test assumes that the series are jointly stationary, we also develop
a change-point detection procedure to validate this assumption, which is of
independent interest. The most imposing technical hurdle in implementing the
proposed tests involves estimating the spectrum of a high dimensional spectral
density operator at frequency zero. We propose a simple dimension reduction

modern condensed matter physics, Dirac semimetals and atomically-thin layered
materials. When these trends meet again in transition metal compounds, which
possess spin and orbital degrees of freedom and strong electron correlations,
more exotic phenomena are expected to emerge in the cross section of
topological states of matter and Mott physics. Here, we show by using ab initio
calculations that a monolayer form of transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTs),
which has a honeycomb network of transition metal cations, may exhibit multiple
Dirac cones with tunable gaps in the electronic structure. Furthermore, we
elucidate that electron correlations and carrier doping turn the multiple-Dirac
semimetal into a topological ferromagnet with high Chern number. Our findings
raise the honeycomb-monolayer TMTs to a new paradigm to explore correlated
Dirac electrons and topologically-nontrivial magnetism. In turn, the unique
wide-ranging properties of the materials will deliver new building blocks for
atomically thin heterostructures.

asymptotic solution of the KdV equation for both linear and weakly nonlinear

investigated is the analytical solution of viscous-KdV equation which reveals

method for the flux is applied in order avoid violation of both, the entropy
and ""Rankine-Hugoniot"" jump conditions. The time evolution is then computed
using a forward finite difference scheme. This numerical technique evades the
recovery of the primitive vector by solving an algebraic system of equations as
it is often used and so, it generalises standard techniques to solve these kind
of coupled systems. The article is presented bearing in mind special
relativistic hydrodynamic numerical schemes with an added pedagogical view in
the appendix section in order to easily comprehend the PVRS. We present the
convergence of the method for standard shock-tube problems of special
relativistic hydrodynamics and a graphical visualisation of the errors using
the fluctuations of the numerical values with respect to exact analytic
solutions. The PVRS circumvents the sometimes arduous computation that arises
from standard numerical methods techniques, which obtain the desired primitive
vector solution through an algebraic polynomial of the charges.

and field equations of non-Abelian gauge fields, considering the spatial
dimensions of a unit vector as the color degrees of freedom in the
complex-quaternion wavefunctions, exploring the physical properties of the
color confinement essentially. J. C. Maxwell was the first to employ the
quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. His
method inspires some subsequent scholars to introduce the quaternions,
octonions, and sedenions to research the electromagnetic field, gravitational
field, nuclear field, quantum mechanics, and gauge field. The application of
complex-sedenions is capable of depicting not only the field equations of the
classical mechanics on the macroscopic scale, but also the field equations of
the quantum mechanics on the microscopic scale. The latter can be degenerated
into the Dirac equation and Yang-Mills equation. In contrast to the
complex-number wavefunction, the wavefunction in the complex-quaternion space
possesses three new degrees of freedom, that is, three color degrees of
freedom. One complex-quaternion wavefunction is equivalent to three
conventional wavefunctions with the complex-numbers. It means that the three
spatial dimensions of unit vector in the complex-quaternion wavefunction can be
considered as the `three colors', naturally the color confinement will be
effective. In other words, in the complex-quaternion space, the `three colors'
are only the spatial dimensions, rather than any property of physical
substance. The existing `three colors' can be merged into the wavefunction,
described with the complex-quaternions.
