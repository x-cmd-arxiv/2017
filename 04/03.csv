totally real CR-structure, which contains two correlated 3-dimensional
CR-structures. It is defined by explicit Cartan relations and characterized by
the ""left"" and ""right"" CP3 points with two spinors and two Newman complex
trajectories. Using a gauge field action, which depends on this LCR-structure
and not the metric, a 4-dimensional pseudo-conformal field theory (PCFT) is
formulated. It is invariant under the two Cartan infinite dimensional Lie
algebras of the contained 3-dimensional CR-structures, in complete analogy to
the 2-dimensional CFT. These algebras do not assume central charges. ""Open"" and
""closed"" LCR-manifolds are defined in analogy to the 2-dimensional string
theory. The states and transition amplitudes of the PCFT model are defined
using the path-integral formalism as functional integrations over the
LCR-structures, where a summation over the structure relative invariants has to
be considered in addition to the ordinary summation over the topological
invariants of the LCR-manifolds. The gauge field propagator in the sector of
the ""open"" degenerate LCR-structure is computed and found to be confining.
Using the Elie Cartan list of automorphisms of the 3-dimensinal CR-structures,
the automorphisms of the LCR-structures are investigated. The Poincar\'e group
is an automorphism of the degenerate LCR-structure which is considered as the
vacuum. The ""left"" and ""right"" spinors of the vacuum LCR-structure transform
under the corresponding non-equivalent conjugate representations of the Lorentz
group. The electron-positron with electromagnetic and gravitational radiations
is identified as the Kerr-Newman LCR-manifold and the general phenomenological
framework is outlined.

perfect fluids, superfluids, solids and supersolids media. Symmetries dictate
both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the media. Generically, scalar
perturbations include, besides the gravitational potential, an additional
non-adiabatic mode associated with the entropy per particle {\sigma}. While
perfect fluids and solids are adiabatic with {\sigma} constant in time,
superfluids and supersolids feature a non-trivial dynamics for {\sigma}.
Special classes of isentropic media with zero {\sigma} can also be found.
Tensor modes become massive for solids and supersolids. Such an effective

appropriate BCS-like pairing terms for p-type order parameter. The normal state
band structure of graphene is modified not only through interaction with
adsorbed metal atoms, but also due to the folding of bands at Brillouin zone
boundaries resulting from a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}R30^{\circ}$ reconstruction.
Several different types of pairing symmetries are analyzed utilizing
Nambu-Gorkov Green's function techniques to show that $p+ip$-symmetric
nearest-neighbor pairing yields the most enhanced superconducting gap. The
character of the order parameter depends on the nature of the atomic orbitals
involved in the pairing process and exhibits interesting angular and radial
asymmetries. Finally, we suggest a method to distinguish between singlet and
triplet type superconductivity in the presence of magnetic substitutional
impurities using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

Multiple camera are used to expand the field of view as well as to mitigate the

it attempts to segment and count each individual in the crowd. For such an aim,
two head detectors trained with head images are employed: one based on support
vector machines and another based on Adaboost perceptron. The second approach,
regarded as an indirect approach employs learning algorithms and statistical
analysis on the whole crowd to achieve counting. For such an aim, corner points
are extracted from groups of people in a foreground image and computed by a
learning algorithm which estimates the number of people in the scene. Both
approaches count the number of people on the scene and not only on a given
image or video frame of the scene. The experimental results obtained on the
benchmark PETS2009 video dataset show that proposed indirect method surpasses
other methods with improvements of up to 46.7% and provides accurate counting
results for the crowded scenes. On the other hand, the direct method shows high
error rates due to the fact that the latter has much more complex problems to
solve, such as segmentation of heads.

law for a quadrotor UAV, subsequent to complete failure of a single rotor. The
control design problem considers the reduced state space which excludes the
angular velocity and orientation about the vertical body axis. The proposed
controller enables the quadrotor to track the orientation of this axis, and
consequently any prescribed position trajectory using only three rotors. The
control design is carried out in two stages. First, in order to track the
reduced attitude dynamics, a geometric controller with two input torques is
designed on the Lie-Group $SO(3)$. This is then extended to $SE(3)$ by
designing a saturation based feedback law, in order to track the center of mass
position with bounded thrust. The control law for the complete dynamics
achieves exponential tracking for all initial conditions lying in an open-dense
subset. The novelty of the geometric control design is in its ability to
effectively execute aggressive, global maneuvers despite complete loss of a
rotor. Numerical simulations on models of a variable pitch and a conventional
quadrotor have been presented to demonstrate the practical applicability of the
control design.

both the speed and success rate of measurement-based remote entanglement

these tasks. Here we consider two common measurements that are capable of
projecting into pairwise entangled states, namely half- and full-parity
measurements of two qubits, and determine in each case a globally optimal
protocol for generation of entanglement. For the half-parity measurement, we
rederive a previously described protocol using more general methods and prove
that it is globally optimal for several figures of merit, including maximal
concurrence or fidelity, and minimal time to reach a specified concurrence or
fidelity. For the full-parity measurement, we derive a protocol for rapid
entanglement generation related to that of (C. Hill, J. Ralph, Phys. Rev. A 77,
014305 (2008)), and then map the dynamics of the concurrence of the state to
the Bloch vector length of an effective qubit. This mapping allows us to prove
several optimality results for feedback protocols with full-parity
measurements. We further show that our full-parity protocol transfers
entanglement optimally from one qubit to the other amongst all
measurement-based schemes. The methods developed here will be useful for
deriving feedback protocols and determining their optimality properties in many

galaxies in the desired redshift range with strong [OII] emission. It provides
a target density of 200 deg$^{-2}$ on the North Galactic Cap (NGC) and of 240

investigated at high and low bulk charge carrier concentrations. At low charge
carrier density the WAL curves scale with the normal component of the magnetic
field, demonstrating the dominance of topological surface states in
magnetoconductivity. At high charge carrier density the WAL curves scale with
neither the applied field nor its normal component, implying a mixture of bulk
and surface conduction. WAL due to topological surface states shows no
dependence on the nature (electrons or holes) of the bulk charge carriers. The
observations of an extremely large, non-saturating magnetoresistance, and
ultrahigh mobility in the samples with lower carrier density further support
the presence of surface states. The physical parameters characterizing the WAL
effects are calculated using the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formula. At high charge
carrier concentrations, there is a greater number of conduction channels and a
decrease in the phase coherence length compared to low charge carrier
concentrations. The extremely large magnetoresistance and high mobility of
topological insulators have great technological value and can be exploited in
magneto-electric sensors and memory devices.

arise due to variation in experimental conditions (e.g. microscope settings,
non-specific background signal). This allows us to quantify bcd mRNA gradient
variability from embryo to embryo (important for studying the robustness of
developmental regulatory networks); sort out atypical gradients; and classify

objective. This naturally gives rise to a family of basic min-max graph cut

Answering this in the affirmative, the main goal of this paper is to study the

previous works in which recovery guarantees are based on the convex relaxation
of the problem, we propose a simple iterative algorithm based on
hard-thresholding of appropriate residuals. Under weaker assumptions than
previous works, we prove the global convergence of our iterative procedure;
moreover, it admits a much faster convergence rate and lesser computational
complexity per iteration. In practice, through systematic synthetic and real

turbulence is known to be minimal at small and large Stokes number and
substantial at $\rm St = \mathcal O(1)$. This non-monotonic trend, which has
been shown computationally and experimentally, is yet to be explained
analytically. In this study, we obtain an analytical expression for the
Lyapunov exponents that quantitatively predicts this trend. The sum of the
exponents, which is the normalized rate of change of the signed-volume of a
small cloud of particles, is correctly predicted to be negative and positive at
small and large Stokes numbers, respectively, asymptoting to $\tau Q$ as $\tau
\to 0$ and $\tau^{-1/2} |Q|^{1/4}$ as $\tau \to \infty$, where $\tau$ is the
particle relaxation time and $Q(\tau)$ is the difference between the norm of
the rotation- and strain-rate tensors computed along the particle trajectory.
Additionally, the trajectory crossing is predicted only in hyperbolic flows
where $Q<0$ for sufficiently inertial particles with a $\tau$ that scales with
$|Q|^{-1/2}$. Following the onset of crossovers, a transition from clustering
to dispersion is predicted correctly. We show these behaviors are not unique to
three-dimensional isotropic turbulence and can be reproduced closely by a
one-dimensional mono-harmonic flow, which appears as a fundamental canonical
problem in the study of particle clustering. Analysis of this one-dimensional
canonical flow shows that the rate of clustering, quantified as the product of
the Lyapunov exponent and particle relaxation time, is bounded by $-1/2$,
behaving with extreme nonlinearity in the hyperbolic flows and always remaining
positive in the elliptic flows. These findings, which are stemmed from our
analysis, are corroborated by the direct numerical simulations.

systems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,
planetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs
in non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their
host stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital
separations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide
theory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).
The distribution of $\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis
and the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this
also agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with
circular orbits and $\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet
interactions instead of HEM. By comparing circularisation times with stellar
ages, we found that hot Jupiters with $a < 0.05$ au have modified tidal quality
factors $10^{5} < Q'_p < 10^{9}$, and that stellar $Q'_s > 10^{6}-10^{7}$ are
required to explain the presence of eccentric planets at the same orbital
distance. As a by-product of our analysis, we detected a non-zero eccentricity
for HAT-P-29; we determined that five planets that were previously regarded to
have hints of non-zero eccentricity have circular orbits or undetermined
eccentricities; we unveiled curvatures caused by distant companions in the RV
time series of HAT-P-2, HAT-P-22, and HAT-P-29; and we revised the planetary

opening of new Landau levels. The effect of the anomalous magnetic moment is

$D_\tau(A)$ of positive $\rho\in A$ of trace \tau(\rho)=1 is an algebraic
analogue of the space of density matrices (the set of all positive matrices of
a fixed dimension of unit trace). Motivated by the literature concerning the
metric properties of the space of density matrices, the present paper studies
the density space $D_\tau(A)$ in terms of the Bures metric. Linear maps on A
that map $D_\tau(A)$ back into itself are positive and trace preserving, hence,
they may be viewed as an algebraic analogue of a quantum channel, which are
studied intensely in the literature on quantum computing and quantum
information theory.
  The main results in this paper are: (i) to establish that the Bures metric is
indeed a metric, (ii) to prove that channels induce nonexpansive maps of the
density space $D_\tau(A)$, (iii) to introduce and study channels on A that are
locally contractive maps (which we call Bures contractions) on the metric space
$D_\tau(A)$, and (iv) to analyse Bures contractions from the point of view of
the Frobenius theory of cone preserving linear maps.
  Although the focus is on unital C*-algebras, an important class of examples
is furnished by finite von Neumann algebras. Indeed, several of the C*-algebra
results are established by first proving them for finite von Neumann algebras
and then proving them for C*-algebras by embedding a C*-algebra A into its
enveloping von Neumann algebra $A^{**}$.

constant is larger than a critical value $\alpha_c(D N_f)$. In particular, we
obtain the critical coupling constant $\alpha_c\approx 0.36$ for $D N_f=8$.,
where $D=2,4$ corresponds to the SU(2) and SU(4) cases, respectively, and $N_f$
is the flavor number. Our results show a decreasing of the critical coupling
constant in comparison with the case of pure electromagnetic interaction, thus
yielding a more favorable scenario for the occurrence of dynamical symmetry
breaking. For two-dimensional materials,in application in condensed matter
systems, it implies an energy gap at the Dirac points or valleys of the
honeycomb lattice.

solutions to three difficult and intriguing problems in business finance,
economics and statistics. The paper discusses trading strategies for both
commodities and stocks but the main focus is on stock market trading at the New
York Stock Exchange.
  Problem 1: Buy Low and Sell High. The buy low and sell high problem can be
summarized like this: suppose the price of a commodity or stock fluctuates
indefinitely, is there any explicit strategy for a trader to ""ride the price
waves"" by buying low and selling high to eventually win even if price does not
increase?
  Problem 2: ""Beat"" the Market. In Part 2, the trading system presented in Part
1 is transformed into a strategy that always outperforms the market eventually.
  Problem 3: Can a Trader Outperform a geometric Brownian Motion? The general
belief is that it is impossible to ""beat"" a GBM since technical analysis of
historical prices is useless in predicting future prices. The last part of the
paper shows that the answer to Problem 3 is actually a ""YES"", which is quite
surprising.
  The trading strategies presented are based mainly on information obtained
from the movements of waves and wavelets created by large and small
fluctuations of market prices. They do not involve any forecasting or
prediction of future prices. Behavioral economics also plays a role in the
decision making process of the Wavelet Trading program. My website

magnetic field subject to a strong linearly polarized ac drive. Strong drive
implies that the Zeeman frequencies of the pair-partners are much smaller than
the Rabi frequency, so that the rotating wave approximation does not apply.
What makes the recombination dynamics nontrivial, is that the partners
recombine only when they form a singlet, S. By admixing singlet to triplets,
the drive induces the triplet recombination as well. We calculate the effective
decay rate of all four spin modes. Our main finding is that, under the strong
drive, the major contribution to the decay of the modes comes from short time
intervals when the driving field passes through zero. When the recombination
time in the absence of drive is short, fast recombination from S leads to
anomalously slow recombination from the other spin states of the pair. We show
that, with strong drive, this recombination becomes even slower. The
corresponding decay rate falls off as a power law with the amplitude of the
drive.

slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down
of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself
fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local
density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,
a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is
introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a
certain threshold value, $\rho_{\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle
rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period
($\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy
cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict
that with compression (increasing average density $\rho$) at a fixed
temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the
clusters, $\xi$, diverges as $\xi\sim(\rho_{\rm c}-\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is
the spatial dimensionality. This $\xi$ measures the average persistence length
of the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is
determined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a
fixed $\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\xi\sim(T-T_{\rm
c})^{-2/d}$, for which $\rho$ is identical to $\rho_{\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\rm c}$.
The exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one
predicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some
simulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence
is different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with
the thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.
We further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the
clusters.

of these planets, high pressure converts CH$_4$ into ethane, butane, or diamond
and releases H$_2$. Using simplified models which capture the basic physics of
the internal structure, we show that the physical properties of the atmosphere
depend on the outflux of H$_2$ from the mantle. When this outflux is $\lesssim
10^{10}$ [molec cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$], the outgassed atmosphere has base pressure
$\lesssim$ 1 bar. Larger outflows result in a substantial atmosphere where the
base pressure may approach $10^3 - 10^4$ bar. For any pressure, the mean
density of these planets, 2.4--3 [g cm$^{-3}$], is much larger than the mean
density of Uranus and Neptune, 1.3--1.6 [g cm$^{-3}$]. Thus, observations can
distinguish between a Planet Nine with a primordial H/He-rich atmosphere

networks provide opportunities to study link formation processes. However,
networks at scale often exhibits community structure (i.e. clustering), which
may confound local structural effects if it is not considered appropriately in
statistical analysis. To infer the (possibly) evolving clusters and other
network structures (e.g. degree distribution and/or transitivity) within each
community, simultaneously, we propose a class of statistical models named
Temporal Hierarchical Exponential Random Graph Models (THERGM). Our generative
model imposes a Markovian transition matrix for nodes to change their
membership, and assumes they join new community in a preferential attachment
way. For those remaining in the same cluster, they follow a specific temporal
ERG model (TERGM). While a direct MCMC based Bayesian estimation is
computational infeasible, we propose a two-stage strategy. At the first stage,
a specific dynamic latent space model will be used as the working model for
clustering. At the second stage, estimated memberships are taken as given to
fit a TERG model in each cluster. We evaluate our methods on simulated data in
terms of the mis-clustering rate, as well as the goodness of fit and link
prediction accuracy.

explosive thermonuclear fusion event is also one of the major processes

dynamics simulations suggest that the TBR between a multilayer 2-dimensional

explain this thickness dependence, we generalize the recent theory for
single-layer 2D crystals by Ong, Cai and Zhang [Phys. Rev. B 94, 165427

collection of real-valued functions on $\Omega$ is called a \emph{Noetherian
chain} if the partial derivatives of each function are expressible as
polynomials in the functions. A \emph{Noetherian function} is a polynomial
combination of elements of a Noetherian chain. We introduce \emph{Noetherian
parameters} (degrees, size of the coefficients) which measure the complexity of
a Noetherian chain. Our main result is an explicit form of the Pila-Wilkie
theorem for sets defined using Noetherian equalities and inequalities: for any
$\epsilon>0$, the number of points of height $H$ in the transcendental part of
the set is at most $C\cdot H^{\epsilon}$ where $C$ can be \emph{explicitly}
estimated from the Noetherian parameters and $\epsilon$.
  We show that many functions of interest in arithmetic geometry fall within
the Noetherian class, including elliptic and abelian functions, modular
functions and universal covers of compact Riemann surfaces, Jacobi theta
functions, periods of algebraic integrals, and the uniformizing map of the
Siegel modular variety $\mathcal{A}_g$. We thus effectivize the (geometric side
of) Pila-Zannier strategy for unlikely intersections in those instances that
involve only compact domains.

photons due to the much stronger interaction between phonons and matter. This
is especially true for high frequency heat carrying phonons, which are
intrinsic lattice vibrations experiencing many decoherence events with the
environment, and are thus generally assumed to be incoherent. Two photon
interference techniques, especially coherent population trapping (CPT) and
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), have led to extremely sensitive
detection, spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose the use of two photon
interference in a three level system to sense coherent phonons. Unlike prior
works which have treated phonon coupling as damping, we account for coherent
phonon coupling using a full quantum-mechanical treatment. We observe strong
asymmetry in absorption spectrum in CPT and negative dispersion in EIT
susceptibility in the presence of coherent phonon coupling which cannot be
accounted for if only pure phonon damping is considered. Our proposal has
application in sensing heat carrying coherent phonons effects and understanding
coherent bosonic multi-pathway interference effects in three coupled oscillator
systems.

  Data","Submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To allow fast and high-quality reconstruction of clinical
accelerated multi-coil MR data by learning a variational network that combines
the mathematical structure of variational models with deep learning.
  Theory and Methods: Generalized compressed sensing reconstruction formulated
as a variational model is embedded in an unrolled gradient descent scheme. All
parameters of this formulation, including the prior model defined by filter
kernels and activation functions as well as the data term weights, are learned
during an offline training procedure. The learned model can then be applied
online to previously unseen data.
  Results: The variational network approach is evaluated on a clinical knee
imaging protocol. The variational network reconstructions outperform standard
reconstruction algorithms in terms of image quality and residual artifacts for
all tested acceleration factors and sampling patterns.
  Conclusion: Variational network reconstructions preserve the natural
appearance of MR images as well as pathologies that were not included in the
training data set. Due to its high computational performance, i.e.,
reconstruction time of 193 ms on a single graphics card, and the omission of
parameter tuning once the network is trained, this new approach to image
reconstruction can easily be integrated into clinical workflow.

tensor to the Fisher information matrix of the categorical distributions, or
(ii) defining the dualistic information-geometric structure induced by a smooth
dissimilarity measure, the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In this work, we
introduce for clustering tasks a novel computationally-friendly framework for
modeling geometrically the probability simplex: The {\em Hilbert simplex

Hilbert's metric distance which satisfies the property of information
monotonicity with distance level set functions described by polytope
boundaries. We show that both the Aitchison and Hilbert simplex distances are
norm distances on normalized logarithmic representations with respect to the
$\ell_2$ and variation norms, respectively. We discuss the pros and cons of
those different statistical modelings, and benchmark experimentally these
different kind of geometries for center-based $k$-means and $k$-center
clustering. Furthermore, since a canonical Hilbert distance can be defined on
any bounded convex subset of the Euclidean space, we also consider Hilbert's
geometry of the elliptope of correlation matrices and study its clustering
performances compared to Fr\""obenius and log-det divergences.

solution is the implementation of hybrid beamforming techniques, which consist
of low-dimensional digital beamforming followed by analog radio frequency (RF)
beamforming. This work studies the optimization of hybrid beamforming in the
context of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture. In a C-RAN
system, digital baseband signal processing functionalities are migrated from
remote radio heads (RRHs) to a baseband processing unit (BBU) in the ""cloud"" by
means of finite-capacity fronthaul links. Specifically, this work tackles the
problem of jointly optimizing digital beamforming and fronthaul quantization
strategies at the BBU, as well as RF beamforming at the RRHs, with the goal of
maximizing the weighted downlink sum-rate. Fronthaul capacity and per-RRH power
constraints are enforced along with constant modulus constraints on the RF
beamforming matrices. An iterative algorithm is proposed that is based on
successive convex approximation and on the relaxation of the constant modulus
constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by numerical

photon index 1.16(4), which is harder than the values measured with RXTE PCA
and NuSTAR. This result supports the log-parabolic model for the broadband
X-ray spectrum. With the unprecedented angular resolution of Chandra, we
clearly identified off-pulse X-ray emission from the pulsar, and its spectrum
is best fit by a power law plus blackbody model. The latter component has a
temperature of ~0.14 keV with a bolometric luminosity comparable to the
luminosities of other young and high magnetic field RPPs, and it lies between
the temperature of magnetars and typical RPPs. In addition, we found that the

1.0 and 1.8 and anticorrelated with the flux. This is similar to the behavior

mathematics, called intuitionism. Intuitionism was revolutionary in many
respects but stands out -mathematically speaking- for its challenge of
Hilbert's formalist philosophy of mathematics and rejection of the law of
excluded middle from the 'classical' logic used in mainstream mathematics. Out
of intuitionism grew intuitionistic logic and the associated
Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation by which 'there exists x' intuitively
means 'an algorithm to compute x is given'. A number of schools of constructive
mathematics were developed, inspired by Brouwer's intuitionism and invariably
based on intuitionistic logic, but with varying interpretations of what
constitutes an algorithm. This paper deals with the dichotomy between
constructive and non-constructive mathematics, or rather the absence of such an
'excluded middle'. In particular, we challenge the 'binary' view that
mathematics is either constructive or not. To this end, we identify a part of
classical mathematics, namely classical Nonstandard Analysis, and show it
inhabits the twilight-zone between the constructive and non-constructive.
Intuitively, the predicate 'x is standard' typical of Nonstandard Analysis can
be interpreted as 'x is computable', giving rise to computable (and sometimes
constructive) mathematics obtained directly from classical Nonstandard
Analysis. Our results formalise Osswald's longstanding conjecture that
classical Nonstandard Analysis is locally constructive. Finally, an alternative
explanation of our results is provided by Brouwer's thesis that logic depends
upon mathematics.

Knowledge of the Lorenz number is important in many situations, such as in the

of a factor of two (or in the case of a bipolar system with a Fermi level near

identifying the sources of deviation in unipolar and bipolar two-band systems,

solar meridional circulation. However, travel-time measurements of the
subsurface meridional flow suffer from a variety of systematic errors, such as
a center-to-limb variation and an offset due to the P-angle uncertainty of
solar images. Here we apply the time-distance technique to contemporaneous
medium-degree Dopplergrams produced by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI to obtain the
travel-time difference caused by meridional circulation throughout the solar
convection zone. The P-angle offset in MDI images is measured by
cross-correlating MDI and HMI images. The travel-time measurements in the
south-north and east-west directions are averaged over the same observation
period for the two data sets and then compared to examine the consistency of
MDI and HMI travel times after correcting the systematic errors.
  The offsets in the south-north travel-time difference from MDI data induced
by the P-angle error gradually diminish with increasing travel distance.
However, these offsets become noisy for travel distances corresponding to waves
that reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that a careful
treatment of the P-angle problem is required when studying a deep meridional
flow. After correcting the P-angle and the removal of the center-to-limb
effect, the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI are consistent within the
error bars for meridional circulation covering the entire convection zone. The
fluctuations observed in both data sets are highly correlated and thus indicate
their solar origin rather than an instrumental origin. Although our results
demonstrate that the ad hoc correction is capable of reducing the wide
discrepancy in the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI, we cannot exclude
the possibility that there exist other systematic effects acting on the two
data sets in the same way.

test our results with high resolution GPS human trajectories, where a constant
sampling interval allows to recover at best $18\%$ of the movements, while
over-evaluating the average trip length by a factor of $2$. If we use a
sampling interval extracted from real communication data, we recover only
$11\%$ of moves, a value that cannot be increased above $16\%$ even with ideal
algorithms. These figures call for a more cautious use of data in all
quantitative studies of individuals' trajectories, casting in particular
serious doubts on the results of previous studies on human mobility based on
mobile phone data.

industry and academia. While several projects aim to build scalable and fast ML
systems, little work has addressed the pains of sourcing data and features for
ML tasks. Real-world relational databases typically have many tables (often,
dozens) and data scientists often struggle to even obtain and join all possible
tables that provide features for ML. In this context, Kumar et al. showed
recently that key-foreign key dependencies (KFKDs) between tables often lets us
avoid such joins without significantly affecting prediction accuracy--an idea
they called avoiding joins safely. While initially controversial, this idea has
since been used by multiple companies to reduce the burden of data sourcing for
ML. But their work applied only to linear classifiers. In this work, we verify
if their results hold for three popular complex classifiers: decision trees,
SVMs, and ANNs. We conduct an extensive experimental study using both
real-world datasets and simulations to analyze the effects of avoiding KFK
joins on such models. Our results show that these high-capacity classifiers are
surprisingly and counter-intuitively more robust to avoiding KFK joins compared
to linear classifiers, refuting an intuition from the prior work's analysis. We
explain this behavior intuitively and identify open questions at the
intersection of data management and ML theoretical research. All of our code

originating from the pion Boer-Mulders TMD PDFs convoluted with either the

a hard scale comparable to that of a recent COMPASS SIDIS measurement and hence

very common problems that can significantly alter the process outcome, e.g. the
chemical reaction efficiency, or the purity and the final concentrations of a
suspension. It is therefore no surprise that both levitation and minimal
contact transport methods including non wetting surfaces have been developed to
minimize the interactions between liquids and surfaces. Here we demonstrate
contactless surface levitation and transport of liquid drops, realized by
harnessing and sustaining the natural sublimation of a solid carbon
dioxide-coated substrate to generate a continuous supporting vapor layer. The
capability and limitations of this technique in handling liquids of extreme
surface tension and kinematic viscosity values are investigated both
experimentally and theoretically. The sublimating coating is capable of
repelling many viscous and low surface tension liquids, colloidal suspensions,
and non-Newtonian fluids as well, displaying outstanding omniphobic properties.
Finally, we demonstrate how sublimation can be used for liquid transport,
mixing and drop coalescence, with a sublimating layer coated on an underlying
substrate with prefabricated channels, conferring omniphobicity with a simple
physical approach, rather than a chemical one.

approach to simulate quasi-steady, heat flux driven close-contact melting. It
extends existing approaches found in the literature, and, for the first time,
allows to study the impact of a spatially varying heat flux distribution. We
will start by deriving the governing equations in a Lagrangian reference frame
fixed to the heat source. Exploiting the narrowness of the melt film enables us
to reduce the momentum balance to the Reynolds equation, which is coupled to
the energy balance via the velocity field. We particularize our derivation for
two simple, yet technically relevant geometries, namely a 3d circular disc and
a 2d planar heat source. An iterative solution procedure for the coupled system
is described in detail and discussed on the basis of a convergence study.
Furthermore, we present an extension to allow for rotational melting modes.
Various test cases demonstrate the proficiency of our method. In particular, we
will utilize the method to assess the efficiency of the close-contact melting
process and to quantify the model error introduced if convective losses are
neglected. Finally, we will draw conclusions and present an outlook to future

power spectrum with the transient decay time window, approaching $1/f$-type

a deeper but narrower network. Compared to narrower and deeper networks, wide
networks employ relatively less number of layers and have various important
benefits, such that they have less running time on parallel computing devices,
and they are less affected by gradient vanishing problems. However, the
parameter size of a wide network can be very large due to use of large width of
each layer in the network. In order to keep the benefits of wide networks
meanwhile improve the parameter size and accuracy trade-off of wide networks,
we propose a binary tree architecture to truncate architecture of wide networks
by reducing the width of the networks. More precisely, in the proposed
architecture, the width is continuously reduced from lower layers to higher
layers in order to increase the expressive capacity of network with a less
increase on parameter size. Also, to ease the gradient vanishing problem,
features obtained at different layers are concatenated to form the output of
our architecture. By employing the proposed architecture on a baseline wide
network, we can construct and train a new network with same depth but
considerably less number of parameters. In our experimental analyses, we
observe that the proposed architecture enables us to obtain better parameter
size and accuracy trade-off compared to baseline networks using various
benchmark image classification datasets. The results show that our model can
decrease the classification error of baseline from 20.43% to 19.22% on

greater than $70$ keV, and effects thought to be important in these experiments
are included, i.e. particle sources, orbital losses, the loop voltage and
microwave heating, with suitable volume averaging where necessary to give terms
independent of spatial dimensions. The model predicts current carried by
electrons with the same energies as inferred from the experiments, though the
current drive efficiency is smaller.

simulating multiple compressible fluids. Numerical treatments for a cut cell
shared by more than two materials are proposed. First, we simplify the
interface interaction inside such a cell with a reduced model to avoid explicit
interface reconstruction and complex flux calculation. Second, conservation is
strictly preserved by an efficient conservation correction procedure for the
cut cell. To improve the robustness, a multi-material scale separation model is
developed to consistently remove non-resolved interface scales. In addition,
the multi-resolution method and local time-stepping scheme are incorporated
into the proposed multi-material method to speed up the high-resolution
simulations. Various numerical test cases, including the multi-material shock
tube problem, inertial confinement fusion implosion, triple-point shock

method is suitable for a wide range of complex compressible multi-material

However, many ABC algorithms require a large number of simulations, which can
be costly. To reduce the computational cost, Bayesian optimisation (BO) and
surrogate models such as Gaussian processes have been proposed. Bayesian
optimisation enables one to intelligently decide where to evaluate the model
next but common BO strategies are not designed for the goal of estimating the

propose to compute the uncertainty in the ABC posterior density, which is due
to a lack of simulations to estimate this quantity accurately, and define a
loss function that measures this uncertainty. We then propose to select the
next evaluation location to minimise the expected loss. Experiments show that
the proposed method often produces the most accurate approximations as compared

a unique sample of the properties of the early solar nebula. The microscopic
properties of this dust played a key part in particle aggregation during the
formation of the Solar System. Cometary dust was previously considered to
comprise irregular, fluffy agglomerates on the basis of interpretations of
remote observations in the visible and infrared and the study of chondritic
porous interplanetary dust particles that were thought, but not proved, to
originate in comets. Although the dust returned by an earlier mission has
provided detailed mineralogy of particles from comet 81P/Wild, the fine-grained
aggregate component was strongly modified during collection. Here we report in
situ measurements of dust particles at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The
particles are aggregates of smaller, elongated grains, with structures at
distinct sizes indicating hierarchical aggregation. Topographic images of
selected dust particles with sizes of one micrometre to a few tens of
micrometres show a variety of morphologies, including compact single grains and
large porous aggregate particles, similar to chondritic porous interplanetary
dust particles. The measured grain elongations are similar to the value
inferred for interstellar dust and support the idea that such grains could
represent a fraction of the building blocks of comets. In the subsequent growth
phase, hierarchical agglomeration could be a dominant process and would produce
aggregates that stick more easily at higher masses and velocities than
homogeneous dust particles. The presence of hierarchical dust aggregates in the
near-surface of the nucleus of comet 67P also provides a mechanism for lowering
the tensile strength of the dust layer and aiding dust release.

and theoretical research both for its intrinsic interest and for its potential
exploitation in the realization of new spintronic functionalities. Spin-orbit
coupling is one of the key microscopic mechanisms to couple charge currents and
spin polarizations. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a two-dimensional
electron gas has been shown to give rise to the inverse spin galvanic effect,
i.e. the generation of a non-equilibrium spin polarization by a charge current.
Whereas the Rashba model may be applied to the interpretation of experimental
results in many cases, in general in a given real physical system spin-orbit
coupling also occurs due other mechanisms such as Dresselhaus bulk inversion
asymmetry and scattering from impurities. In this work we consider the inverse
spin galvanic effect in the presence of Rashba, Dresselhaus and impurity
spin-orbit scattering. We find that the size and form of the inverse spin
galvanic effect is greatly modified by the presence of the various sources of
spin-orbit coupling. Indeed, spin-orbit coupling affects the spin relaxation
time by adding the Elliott-Yafet mechanism to the Dyakonov-Perel and,
furthermore, it changes the non-equilibrium value of the current-induced spin
polarization by introducing a new spin generation torque. We use a diagrammatic
Kubo formula approach to evaluate the spin polarization-charge current response
function. We finally comment about the relevance of our results for the
interpretation of experimental results.

atmosphere, nominally based on HD 209458b, aimed at exploring both the
evolution of the deep atmosphere, and the acceleration of the zonal flow or
jet. We find the occurrence of a super-rotating equatorial jet is robust to
changes in various parameters, and over long timescales, even in the absence of
strong inner or bottom boundary drag. This jet is diminished in one simulation
only, where we strongly force the deep atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature
gradient over long timescales. Finally, although the eddy momentum fluxes in
our atmosphere show similarities with the proposed mechanism for accelerating
jets on tidally-locked planets, the picture appears more complex. We present
tentative evidence for a jet driven by a combination of eddy momentum transport
and mean flow.

it is often complex to describe, visualize, and compare large sequence data,
especially when there are multiple parallel sequences per subject. Hidden
(latent) Markov models (HMMs) are able to detect underlying latent structures

(MHMMs) allows clustering data into homogeneous subsets, with or without

  The seqHMM package in R is designed for the efficient modeling of sequences

one or multiple interdependent sequences using HMMs and MHMMs. Also other
restricted variants of the MHMM can be fitted, e.g., latent class models,

of data and models are useful during the whole analysis process from the first

angular momentum, which can be observed in two-photon absorption ($\Gamma_5^+$

and of $F$ excitons in one-photon absorption has given evidence that the
dispersion properties of the $\Gamma_5^+$ orbital valence band is giving rise
to a coupling of the yellow and green exciton series. In this paper we show
that the even and odd parity exciton system can be consistently described
within the same theoretical approach. However, the Hamiltonian of the even
parity system needs, in comparison to the odd exciton case, modifications to
account for the very small radius of the $1S$ exciton. In the presented
treatment we take special care of the central-cell corrections, which comprise
a reduced screening of the Coulomb potential at distances comparable to the
polaron radius, the exchange interaction being responsible for the exciton
splitting into ortho and para states, and the inclusion of terms in the fourth
power of $p$ in the kinetic energy. Since the yellow $1S$ exciton state is
coupled to all other states of positive parity, we show how the central-cell
corrections affect the whole even exciton series. The close resonance of the
$1S$ green exciton with states of the yellow exciton series has a strong impact
on the energies and oscillator strengths of all implied states. The consistency
between theory and experiment with respect to energies and oscillator strengths
for the even and odd exciton system in $\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ is a convincing proof
for the validity of the applied theory.

electronic, topological, optical and thermoelectric properties of materials. In
this work, strain-dependent phonon transport of recently-fabricated antimonene
(Sb monolayer) under biaxial strain is investigated from a combination of
first-principles calculations and the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It
is found that the ZA dispersion of antimonene with strain less than -1\% gives
imaginary frequencies, which suggests that compressive strain can induce
structural instability. Experimentally, it is possible to enhance structural
stability by tensile strain. Calculated results show that lattice thermal
conductivity increases with strain changing from -1\% to 6\%, and lattice
thermal conductivity at 6\% strain is 5.6 times larger than that at -1\% strain
at room temperature. It is interesting that lattice thermal conductivity is in
inverse proportion to buckling parameter $h$ in considered strain range. Such a
strain dependence of lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to enhanced
phonon lifetimes caused by increased strain, while group velocities have a
decreased effect on lattice thermal conductivity with increasing strain. It is
found that acoustic branches dominate the lattice thermal conductivity over the
full strain range. The cumulative room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity
at -1\% strain converges to maximum with phonon mean free path (MFP) at 50 nm,
while one at 6\% strain becomes as large as 44 $\mathrm{\mu m}$, which suggests
that strain can give rise to very strong size effects on lattice thermal
conductivity in antimonene. These results may provide guidance on fabrication
techniques of antimonene, and offer perspectives on tuning lattice thermal
conductivity by size and strain for applications of thermal management and
thermoelectricity.

in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for a one-parameter family of explicit scale-invariant
axi-symmetric initial data, which is smooth away from the origin and invariant
under the reflection with respect to the $xy$-plane. Working in the class of
axi-symmetric fields, we calculate numerically scale-invariant solutions of the
Cauchy problem in terms of their profile functions, which are smooth. The
solutions are necessarily unique for small data, but for large data we observe
a breaking of the reflection symmetry of the initial data through a
pitchfork-type bifurcation. By a variation of previous results by Jia &
\v{S}ver\'ak (2013) it is known rigorously that if the behavior seen here
numerically can be proved, optimal non-uniqueness examples for the Cauchy
problem can be established, and two different solutions can exists for the same
initial datum which is divergence-free, smooth away from the origin, compactly
supported, and locally $(-1)$-homogeneous near the origin. In particular,
assuming our (finite-dimensional) numerics represents faithfully the behavior
of the full (infinite-dimensional) system, the problem of uniqueness of the
Leray-Hopf solutions (with non-smooth initial data) has a negative answer and,
in addition, the perturbative arguments such those by Kato (1984) and Koch &
Tataru (2001), or the weak-strong uniqueness results by Leray, Prodi, Serrin,
Ladyzhenskaya and others, already give essentially optimal results. There are
no singularities involved in the numerics, as we work only with smooth profile
functions. It is conceivable that our calculations could be upgraded to a

additional work and calculations, including a much more detailed analysis of

attractive alternative for reasons of accuracy and efficiency and because time
step limitations associated with causal, CFL-like critera are avoided. In this
work, the Lorenz 1984 chaotic equations are solved using the time-spectral
algorithm GWRM. Comparisons of accuracy and efficiency are carried out for both
explicit and implicit time-stepping algorithms. It is found that the efficiency
of the GWRM compares well with these methods, in particular at high accuracy.
For perturbative scenarios, the GWRM was found to be as much as four times
faster than the finite difference methods. A primary reason is that the GWRM
time intervals typically are two orders of magnitude larger than those of the
finite difference methods. The GWRM has the additional advantage to produce
analytical solutions in the form of Chebyshev series expansions. The results
are encouraging for pursuing further studies, including spatial dependence, of
the relevance of time-spectral methods for NWP modelling.

  Given vertices $u,v$, linkable$(u,v)$ decides whether $u$ and $v$ are

investigation on high-dimensional EL from a new scope targeting at estimating a
high-dimensional sparse model parameters. We show that the new scope provides
an opportunity for relaxing the stringent requirement on the dimensionality of
the model parameter. Motivated by the new scope, we then propose a new
penalized EL by applying two penalty functions respectively regularizing the
model parameters and the associated Lagrange multipliers in the optimizations
of EL. By penalizing the Lagrange multiplier to encourage its sparsity, we show
that drastic dimension reduction in the number of estimating equations can be
effectively achieved without compromising the validity and consistency of the
resulting estimators. Most attractively, such a reduction in dimensionality of
estimating equations is actually equivalent to a selection among those
high-dimensional estimating equations, resulting in a highly parsimonious and
effective device for high-dimensional sparse model parameters. Allowing both
the dimensionalities of model parameters and estimating equations growing
exponentially with the sample size, our theory demonstrates that the estimator
from our new penalized EL is sparse and consistent with asymptotically normally
distributed nonzero components. Numerical simulations and a real data analysis
show that the proposed penalized EL works promisingly.

strongly related to the quantum Hall effect (QHE) on lattices. This relation
suggests to revisit the QHE because its Hall conductivity can be
unconventionally quantized. It exhibits a jump and changes sign abruptly if the
Fermi level crosses a van Hove singularity. In this Paper, we investigate the
unconventional QHE features by discussing band structures, Hall conductivities,
and topological edge states for square and triangular lattices; their origin
are Chern numbers of bands in the skyrmion crystal (THE) or of the
corresponding Landau levels (QHE). Striking features in the energy dependence
of the Hall conductivities are traced back to the band structure without

these findings, we derive an approximation that allows us to determine the

interaction among many agents when they are strategic and have various security
measures they can choose to defend themselves. The overall network security is
measured by what we call the average risk exposure (ARE) from neighbors, which
is proportional to the total (expected) number of attacks in the network.
  We first show that there exists a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a
population game. Then, we prove that as the agents with larger degrees in the
dependence graph see higher risks than those with smaller degrees, the overall
network security deteriorates in that the ARE experienced by agents increases
and there are more attacks in the network. Finally, using this finding, we
demonstrate that the effects of network mixing on ARE depend on the (cost)
effectiveness of security measures available to agents; if the security
measures are not effective, increasing assortativity of dependence graph
results in higher ARE. On the other hand, if the security measures are
effective at fending off the damages and losses from attacks, increasing
assortativity reduces the ARE experienced by agents.

selection task involves selecting the most informative variables for the model.
When the model is a simple location model and the number of relevant features
does not grow with the total number of features, sparse feature selection
corresponds to sparse mean estimation. We deal with a simplified mean
estimation problem consisting of an additive model with gaussian noise and mean
that is in a restricted, finite hypothesis space. This restriction simplifies
the mean estimation problem into a selection problem of combinatorial nature.
Although the hypothesis space is finite, its size is exponential in the
dimension of the mean. In limited data settings and when the size of the
hypothesis space depends on the amount of data or on the dimension of the data,
choosing an approximation set of hypotheses is a desirable approach. Choosing a
set of hypotheses instead of a single one implies replacing the bias-variance
trade off with a resolution-stability trade off. Generalization capacity
provides a resolution selection criterion based on allowing the learning
algorithm to communicate the largest amount of information in the data to the
learner without error. In this work the theory of approximation set coding and
generalization capacity is explored in order to understand this approach. We
then apply the generalization capacity criterion to the simplified sparse mean

higher harmonics, and combination frequencies: the stellar rotation period
$P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 6.82\pm0.18$ d, most likely related to the presence of the
stable magnetic poles, and a variation with a period of $10.0\pm0.3$ d
attributed to circumstellar environment, also detected in the H$\alpha$ and
several He I lines, yet absent in the purely photospheric lines. We confirm the
variability with $P_{\mathrm{rot}}$/4, likely caused by surface
inhomogeneities, being the possible photospheric drivers of the discrete

level of circumstellar activity clearly differs between the two BRITE observing
campaigns. We demonstrate that $\zeta$ Ori Aa is a highly variable star with
both periodic and non-periodic variations, as well as episodic events. The

exploiting new physics emerging in larger integrated quantum networks and for
stronger couplings. However control solid-state devices has constraints coming
from selection rules, due to symmetries which on the other hand yield
protection from decoherence, and from design issues, for instance that coupling
to microwave cavities is not directly switchable. We present two new schemes
for the $\Lambda$-STIRAP control problem with the constraint of one or two

converted to apply to circuit-QED architectures. We finally illustrate an
application to coherent spectroscopy of the so called ultrastrong atom-cavity

recently proposed by Y. Guo [Sci. Rep. 6, 25241 (2016)]. By recourse to a
systematic survey of a two-qubit system, we detected an undesirable behavior of
such a measure related to its representation-dependence. In the case of pure
states, this dependence manifests as a non-satisfactory entanglement measure
whenever a representation other than the Schmidt's is used. In order to avoid
this dependence on the basis, we argue that a minimization procedure over the
set of all possible representations of the quantum state is required. In the
case of pure states, this minimization can be analytically performed and the
optimal basis turns out to be that of Schmidt's. In addition, the resulting
measure inherits the main properties of Guo's measure and, unlike the latter,
it reduces to a legitimate entanglement measure in the case of pure states.
Some examples involving general mixed states are also analyzed considering such
a optimization. The results show that, in most cases of interest, the use of
Guo's measure can result in a overestimation of quantum correlations. However,
since Guo's measure has the advantage of being easily computable, it might be
used as a qualitative estimator of the presence of quantum correlations.

combine density functional theory with nonequilibrium Green's function
techniques to compute these two quantities in junctions with either a C$_{60}$
monomer or a C$_{60}$ dimer connected to gold electrodes, taking into account
the contributions of both electrons and phonons. Our results show that for
C$_{60}$ monomer junctions phonon transport plays a minor role in the thermal
conductance and, in turn, in the figure of merit, which can reach relatively
high values on the order of 0.1, depending on the contact geometry. At the
contrary, phonons completely dominate the thermal conductance in C$_{60}$ dimer
junctions and strongly reduce the figure of merit as compared to monomer
junctions. Thus, claims that by stacking C$_{60}$ molecules one could achieve
high thermoelectric performance, which have been made without considering the
phonon contribution, are not justified. Moreover, we analyze the relevance of
near-field thermal radiation for the figure of merit of these junctions within
the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. We conclude that photon
tunneling can be another detrimental factor for the thermoelectric performance,
which has been overlooked so far in the field of molecular electronics. Our
study illustrates the crucial roles that phonon transport and photon tunneling
can play when critically assessing the performance of molecular junctions as
potential nanoscale thermoelectric devices.

of programming language calculi, type systems, operational semantics, and
related formal systems has received considerable attention recently. However,
the dual problem of searching for errors in such formalizations has attracted
comparatively little attention. In this article, we present $\alpha$Check, a
bounded model-checker for metatheoretic properties of formal systems specified
using nominal logic. In contrast to the current state of the art for metatheory
verification, our approach is fully automatic, does not require expertise in
theorem proving on the part of the user, and produces counterexamples in the
case that a flaw is detected. We present two implementations of this technique,
one based on negation-as-failure and one based on negation elimination, along
with experimental results showing that these techniques are fast enough to be
used interactively to debug systems as they are developed.

referred to as a point cloud or a particle cloud, moves with the flow velocity.
In this paper, we consider different numerical methods of performing this
movement of points or particles. The movement is most commonly done by a first
order method, which assumes the velocity to be constant within a time step. We
show that this method is very inaccurate and that it introduces volume and mass
conservation errors. We further propose new methods for the same which
prescribe an additional ODE system that describes the characteristic velocity.
Movement is then performed along this characteristic velocity. The first new
way of moving points is an extension of mesh-based streamline tracing ideas to
meshfree methods. In the second way, the movement is done based on the
difference in approximated streamlines between two time levels, which
approximates the pathlines in unsteady flow. Numerical comparisons show these
method to be vastly superior to the conventionally used first order method.

gauge boson $X$ (with $M_X \ll M_W$), and characterized by a gauge coupling
$g_X$, have been proposed as a mean to reconcile cosmological observations and
short-baseline laboratory anomalies. We constrain this scenario using the
latest Planck data on Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies, and
measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We consistently include the
effect of secret interactions on cosmological perturbations, namely the
increased density and pressure fluctuations in the neutrino fluid, and still
find a severe tension between the secret interaction framework and cosmology.
In fact, taking into account neutrino scattering via secret interactions, we
derive our own mass bound on sterile neutrinos and find (at 95% CL) $m_s <
0.82$ eV or $m_s < 0.29$ eV from Planck alone or in combination with BAO,
respectively. These limits confirm the discrepancy with the laboratory
anomalies. Moreover, we constrain, in the limit of contact interaction, the
effective strength $G_X$ to be $ < 2.8 (2.0) \times 10^{10}\,G_F$ from Planck
(Planck+BAO). This result, together with the mass bound, strongly disfavours
the region with $M_X \sim 0.1$ MeV and relatively large coupling $g_X\sim

approach is that a single damped mode can be used to provide a harmonic
environment with Lorentzian spectral density. More complex spectral functions
can be tailored by combining several individually damped modes. We propose to
work with mixed-species crystals such that one species serves to encode the
spin while the other species is used to cool the vibrational degrees of freedom
to engineer the environment. The strength of the dissipation on the spin can be
controlled by tuning the coupling between spin and vibrational degrees of
freedom. In this way the dynamics of spin-boson models with macroscopic and
non-Markovian environments can be simulated using only a few ions. We
illustrate the approach by simulating an experiment with realistic parameters

lower bounds do not need to use large weights, and hold even if promised

that any algorithm $\mathcal A$ solving sampling problems in turnstile streams
in low memory can be used to encode subsets of $[n]$ of certain sizes into a
number of bits below the information theoretic minimum. Our encoder makes
adaptive queries to $\mathcal A$ throughout its execution, but done carefully
so as to not violate correctness. This is accomplished by injecting random
noise into the encoder's interactions with $\mathcal A$, which is loosely
motivated by techniques in differential privacy. Our second proof is via a
novel randomized reduction from Augmented Indexing [MNSW98] which needs to
interact with $\mathcal A$ adaptively. To handle the adaptivity we identify
certain likely interaction patterns and union bound over them to guarantee
correct interaction on all of them. To guarantee correctness, it is important
that the interaction hides some of its randomness from $\mathcal A$ in the
reduction.

have a potential for achieving high accessibility and controllability thanks to
the lower spatial dimension. Moreover, these objects naturally have a high
sensitivity to vibrations of the hosting membrane due to its low mass density

system based on color centers in a suspended hBN mechanical resonator. Through
group theoretical analyses and ab-initio calculation of the electronic and spin
properties of such a system, we identify a spin doublet ground state and
demonstrate that a spin-motion interaction can be engineered which enables
ground state cooling of the mechanical resonator. We also present a toolbox for
initialization, rotation, and readout of the defect spin qubit. As a result the
proposed setup presents the possibility for studying a wide range of physics.
To illustrate its assets, we show that a fast and noise resilient preparation
of a multicomponent cat state and a squeezed state of the mechanical resonator
is possible; the latter is achieved by realizing the extremely detuned,
ultrastrong coupling regime of the Rabi model, where a phonon superradiant
phase transition is expected to occur.

be explicitly described as a direct limit of finite symmetric groups. It is
homogeneous in the model-theoretic sense since it is the Fraisse limit of the
class of all finite groups. Since its introduction Hall's group, and several
natural generalisations, have been widely studied. In this article we use a
generalisation of Fraisse theory to construct a countable, universal, locally
finite semigroup $\mathcal{T}$, that arises as a direct limit of finite full
transformation semigroups, and has the highest possible degree of homogeneity.
We prove that it is unique up to isomorphism among semigroups satisfying these
properties. We prove an analogous result for inverse semigroups, constructing a
maximally homogeneous universal locally finite inverse semigroup $\mathcal{I}$
which is a direct limit of finite symmetric inverse semigroups (semigroups of
partial bijections). The semigroups $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ are the
natural counterparts of Hall's universal group for semigroups and inverse
semigroups, respectively. While these semigroups are not homogeneous, they
still exhibit a great deal of symmetry. We study the structural features of

contribution to the excess risk comes from the decision boundary of the optimal
Bayes classifier, but we also show that if these conditions are not satisfied,
then the dominant contribution may arise from the tails of the marginal
distribution of the features. Moreover, we prove that, provided the
$d$-dimensional marginal distribution of the features has a finite $\rho$th
moment for some $\rho > 4$ (as well as other regularity conditions), a local
choice of $k$ can yield a rate of convergence of the excess risk of
$O(n^{-4/(d+4)})$, where $n$ is the sample size, whereas for the standard
$k$-nearest neighbour classifier, our theory would require $d \geq 5$ and $\rho

$k$-nearest neighbour classifier for semi-supervised learning problems, where
the unlabelled data are used to obtain an estimate of the marginal feature
density, and fewer neighbours are used for classification when this density
estimate is small. Our worst-case rates are complemented by a minimax lower
bound, which reveals that the local, semi-supervised $k$-nearest neighbour
classifier attains the minimax optimal rate over our classes for the excess
risk, up to a subpolynomial factor in $n$. These theoretical improvements over

studies. Hebbian plasticity is driven by correlated activity of presynaptic and
postsynaptic neurons. Synapses that converge onto the same neuron often behave
as if they compete for a fixed resource; some survive the competition while
others are eliminated. To provide computational interpretations of these
aspects of synaptic plasticity, we formulate unsupervised learning as a
zero-sum game between Hebbian excitation and anti-Hebbian inhibition in a
neural network model. The game formalizes the intuition that Hebbian excitation
tries to maximize correlations of neurons with their inputs, while anti-Hebbian
inhibition tries to decorrelate neurons from each other. We further include a
model of synaptic competition, which enables a neuron to eliminate all
connections except those from its most strongly correlated inputs. Through
empirical studies, we show that this facilitates the learning of sensory
features that resemble parts of objects.

$\eta\rightarrow 3\pi^0\rightarrow 6\gamma$ decay modes were used to optimize
the statistical quality of the data and to estimate systematic uncertainties.
The measurement used the A2 detector setup at the tagged photon beam of the
electron accelerator MAMI in Mainz. A longitudinally polarized deuterated
butanol target was used in combination with a circularly polarized photon beam
from bremsstrahlung of a longitudinally polarized electron beam. The reaction
products were detected with the electromagnetic calorimeters Crystal Ball and
TAPS, which covered 98\% of the full solid angle. The results show that the
narrow structure observed earlier in the unpolarized excitation function of
$\eta$ photoproduction off the neutron appears only in reactions with
antiparallel photon and nucleon spin ($\sigma_{1/2}$). It is absent for
reactions with parallel spin orientation ($\sigma_{3/2}$) and thus very
probably related to partial waves with total spin 1/2. The behavior of the
angular distributions of the helicity-dependent cross sections was analyzed by
fitting them with Legendre polynomials. The results are in good agreement with
a model from the Bonn-Gatchina group, which uses an interference of $P_{11}$
and $S_{11}$ partial waves to explain the narrow structure.

mathematical instance of this methodology is to enumerate the proper vertex
colorings of a graph of growing size by a fixed number of colors.
  In Ehrhart theory, lattice points in the dilation of a fixed polytope by a

seven, only three of which are active over the entire inertial range. Of these
three, one parameter characterizes the variance of the mean field noise in SCT
and another characterizes the rate in the large deviations of the mean. The
third parameter is the decay exponent of the Fourier variables in the Fourier
expansion of the noise, which characterizes the smoothness of the turbulent
velocity. SCT compares favorably with velocity structure functions measured in
the experiment. We considered even-order structure functions ranging in order
from two to eight as well as the third-order structure functions at five
Taylor-Reynolds numbers (Rl) between 110 and 1450. The comparisons highlight
several advantages of the SCT, which include explicit predictions for the
structure functions at any scale and for any Reynolds number. We observed that
finite-Rl corrections, for instance, are important even at the highest Reynolds
numbers produced in the experiments. SCT gives us the correct basis function to
express all the moments of the velocity differences in turbulence in Fourier
space. The SCT produces the coefficients of the series and so determines the
statistical quantities that characterize the small scales in turbulence. It
also characterizes the random force acting on the fluid in the stochastic
Navier-Stokes equation, as described in the paper.

of the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 by utilizing a novel approach, namely
non-volatile electrostatic gating via corona charging of electret polymers.
Sufficient electric field can be imparted to a polymer-TI bilayer to result in
significant electron density depletion, even without the continuous connection
of a gate electrode or the chemical modification of the TI. We show that the
Fermi level of Bi2Se3 is shifted towards the Dirac point with this method.
Using THz spectroscopy, we find that the surface chemical potential is lowered
into the bulk band gap (~ 50 meV above the Dirac point and 170 meV below the
conduction band minimum) and it is stabilized in the intrinsic regime while
enhancing electron mobility. This represents the first use of a charged polymer
gate for modulating TI charge density. The mobility of surface state electrons
is enhanced to a value as high as ~1600 cm^2/Vs at 5K.

to have excellent potential for characterization of gases, in particular their
refractivity and density. However, its performance has in practice been found
to be limited by drifts. To remedy this, drift-free DFPC-OR (DF-DFCB-OR) has
recently been proposed. Suggested methodologies for realization of a specific
type of DF-DFCB-OR, termed Fast Switching DFCB-OR (FS-DFCB-OR), have been
presented in an accompanying work. This paper scrutinizes the performance and
the limitations of both DF- and FS-DFCB-OR for assessments of refractivity and
gas density, in particular their precision, accuracy, and temperature
dependence. It is shown that both refractivity and gas density can be assessed
by FS-DFCB-OR with a precision in the 10$^{-9}$ range under STP conditions. It
is demonstrated that the absolute accuracy is mainly limited by the accuracy by
which the instantaneous deformation of the cavity or the higher order virial
coefficients can be assessed. It is also shown that the internal accuracy, i.e.
the accuracy by which the system can be characterized with respect to an
internal standard, can be several orders of magnitude better than the absolute.
It is concluded that the temperature dependence of FS-DFCB-OR is exceptionally
small, typically in the 10$^{-8}$ to 10$^{-7}$/C range, and primarily caused by
thermal expansion of the FPC-spacer material. Finally, this paper discusses
means on how to design a FS-DFCB-or system for optimal performance and
epitomizes the conclusions of this and our accompanying works regarding both
DF- and FS-DFCB-OR in terms of performance and provides an outlook for both
techniques. Our works can serve as a basis for future realizations of
instrumentation for assessments of gas refractivity and density that can fully
benefit from the extraordinary potential of FPC-OR.

potential for assessments of gas density. However, drifts of the FP cavity
often limit its performance. We show that by the use of two narrow-linewidth
fiber lasers locked to two high finesse cavities and Allan-Werle plots that
drift-free DFPC-OR can be obtained for short measurement times (for which the
drifts of the cavity can be disregarded). Based on this, a novel strategy,
termed fast switching DFPC-OR (FS-DFPC-OR), is presented. A set of novel
methodologies for assessment of both gas density and flow rates (in particular
from small leaks) that are not restricted by the conventional limitations
imposed by the drifts of the cavity are presented. The methodologies deal with
assessments in both open and closed (finite-sized) compartments. They
circumvent the problem with volumetric expansion, i.e. that the gas density in
a measurement cavity is not the same as that in the closed external compartment
that should be assessed, by performing a pair of measurements in rapid
succession; the first one serves the purpose of assessing the density of the
gas that has been transferred into the measurement cavity by the gas
equilibration process, while the 2nd is used to automatically calibrate the
system with respect to the relative volumes of the measurement cavity and the
external compartment. The methodologies for assessments of leak rates comprise
triple cavity evacuation assessments, comprising two measurements performed in
rapid succession, supplemented by a 3rd measurement a certain time thereafter.
A clear explanation of why the technique has such a small temperature
dependence is given. It is concluded that FS-DFPC-OR constitutes a novel
strategy that can be used for precise and accurate assessment of gas number
density and gas flows under a variety of conditions, in particular
non-temperature stabilized ones.

refractometry (OR), FPC-OR, comprising the use of proposed novel methodologies
based on drift-free Dual FPC-OR (DF-DFPC-OR), have alleviated much of earlier
problems with FPC-OR, in particular drifts of the cavity spacer, and therefore
open up for new levels of accurate characterization of gases. However, to be
able to use these techniques for highly accurate assessments, general and
explicit expressions are needed for how the gas density, ${\rho_n}$, is related
to the refractivity of the gas, $n - 1$, and how the latter depends on the
change in frequency of laser light that follows an evacuation of the cavity,
$\Delta {\nu_l}$. This paper presents such relations that properly acknowledge
the influence of all conceivable phenomena and higher order (non-linear)
contributions to the assessment of these entities under drift-free conditions.
The relative contributions of each of these phenomena to measurements of gas
refractivity and density are individually assessed. It is shown, among other
things, that, the influence of cavity deformation is larger for an open cavity
(placed in a compartment in which gas is introduced) than a closed one; if not
accounted for appropriately, under standard pressure and temperature conditions
it can contribute to the accuracy of the technique with up to a few times
10$^{-3}$ if an open cavity is used, while it can be an order of magnitude
smaller, i.e. in the order of 10$^{-4}$, for a well-designed closed cavity. It
is also shown that the non-linearities from dispersion are smaller for the
cases when relocking takes place than when it is not used. The expressions
derived can serve as a basis for assessment of refractivity or gas density, and
changes in such, in future realizations of OR in such a way that they can fully
benefit from the extraordinary power of DF-DFPC-OR.

performance characteristics. Numerical simulations of such wear has seen
increasing attention over the last years. They have the potential to be much
faster and less expensive than the in vitro tests in use today. While it is
unlikely that in silico tests will replace actual physical tests in the
foreseeable future, a judicious combination of both approaches can help making
both implant design and pre-clinical testing quicker and more cost-effective.
  The challenge today for the design of simulation methods is to obtain results
that convey quantitative information, and to do so quickly and reliably. This
involves the choice of mathematical models as well as the numerical tools used
to solve them. The correctness of the choice can only be validated by comparing
with experimental results.
  In this paper we present finite element simulations of the wear in TKRs
during the gait cycle standardized in the ISO 14243-1 document, used for
compliance testing in several countries. As the ISO 14243-1 standard is
precisely defined and publicly available, it can serve as an excellent
benchmark for comparison of wear simulation methods. Our novel contact
algorithm works without Lagrange multipliers and penalty methods, achieving
unparalleled stability and efficiency. We compare our simulation results with
the experimental data from physical tests using two different actual TKRs, each
test being performed three times. We can closely predict the total mass loss
due to wear after five million gait cycles. We also observe a good match
