multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unfortunately, previous work on
multiuser MIMO has shown that the codebook size for channel feedback should
scale exponentially with the number of base station (BS) antennas, which is
greatly increased in massive MIMO systems. To reduce the codebook size and
feedback overhead, we propose an angle-of-departure (AoD)-adaptive subspace
codebook for channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO systems. Our key insight is
to leverage the observation that path AoDs vary more slowly than the path
gains. Within the angle coherence time, by utilizing the constant AoD
information, the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace codebook is able to quantize
the channel vector in a more accurate way. We also provide performance analysis
of the proposed codebook in the large-dimensional regime, where we prove that
to limit the capacity degradation within an acceptable level, the required
number of feedback bits only scales linearly with the number of resolvable
(path) AoDs, which is much smaller than the number of BS antennas. Moreover, we
compare quantized channel feedback using the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace
codebook with analog channel feedback. Extensive simulations that verify the
analytical results are provided.

a practical scheme involving channel inversion with the knowledge of the

Moreover, we adopt a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approach to selecting the

We devise two MIO models for hierarchical variable selection in which the
hierarchical structure of product categories is used to enhance the reliability

However, existing trimming methods ignore the uncertainty in this design stage

sample trimming but has better asymptotic properties. An advantage of the new
smoothly weighted estimator is its asymptotic linearity, which ensures that the

identify the empty regions in these low-dimensional spaces. Unfortunately such
efficiency is lacking in higher dimensions where the problem has been shown to
be NP-complete when the dimensions are included in the input. Applications for
algorithms that find large empty spaces include big data analysis, recommender

nonmagnetic, inversion-symmetry-breaking material is that it consists of only
simple $s$- and $p$-block elements. Interestingly, the material is ordinary
insulator in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and becomes nodal-surface
topological semimetal showing drumhead states when SOC is included. This is in
stark contrast to other nodal-line and nodal-surface semimetals, where the
extended nodal structure is destroyed once SOC is included. Importantly, the
linear band crossings host three-, four-, five- and six-fold degeneracies near
the Fermi level, making this compound very attractive for the study of
`unconventional' fermions. The band crossing points form a three-dimensional
nodal structure around the zone center at the Fermi level. We identify the
surface states responsible for the appearance of the drumhead states. The alloy
also shows a phase transition from topological semimetal to a trivial insulator
on application of pressure. In addition to revealing an intriguing effect of
SOC on the nodal structure, our findings introduce a new half-Heusler alloy in
the family of topological semimetals, thus creating more avenues for
experimental exploration.

effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our

in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI
more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human
intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI
more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we
argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a
theory of AI's mind (ToAIM) - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs,

considerable scientific and popular attention in recent times. Surprisingly, we
find that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its
top-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions
in the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening
to) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better

challenges, we show that one can in principle achieve a cosmic variance limited
measurement of the primary dipole using the reconstruction method we describe.
Since the primary CMB dipole is sensitive to the largest observable scales,
such a measurement would have a number of interesting applications for early

indications of an oscillatory motion of the gas filament. This evidence is
based on both the wave-like morphology of the filament as well as the
kinematics of the gas and stars, where the characteristic velocities of the
stars require a dynamical heating mechanism. As proposed by Stutz and Gould
(2016), such a heating mechanism (the ""Slingshot"") may be the result of an
oscillating gas filament in a gas-dominated (as opposed to stellar-mass
dominated) system. Here we test this hypothesis with the first
stellar-dynamical simulations in which the stars are subjected to the influence
of an oscillating cylindrical potential. The accelerating, cylindrical
background potential is populated with a narrow distribution of stars. By
coupling the potential to N-body dynamics, we are able to measure the influence
of the potential on the stellar distribution. The simulations provide evidence
that the slingshot mechanism can successfully reproduce several stringent
observational constraints. These include the stellar spread (both in projected
position and in velocity) around the filament, the symmetry in these
distributions, and a bulk motion of the stars with respect to the filament.
Using simple considerations we show that star-star interactions are incapable
of reproducing these spreads on their own when properly accounting for the gas
potential. Thus, properly accounting for the gas potential is essential for
understanding the dynamical evolution of star forming filamentary systems in
the era of Gaia.

during the entire cosmic history. It has been argued that quenching of the BH
growth is caused by a transition of a nuclear accretion disk into an advection
dominated accretion flow, with which strong outflows and/or jets are likely to
be associated. We investigate a relation between the maximum mass of SMBHs and
the radio-loudness of quasars with a well-defined sample of $\sim 10^5$ quasars
at a redshift range of $0<z<2$, obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys DR7
catalog. We find that the number fraction of the radio-loud (RL) quasars
increases above a threshold of $M_{\rm BH} \simeq 10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$,
independent of their redshifts. Moreover, the number fraction of RL quasars
with lower Eddington ratios (out of the whole RL quasars), indicating lower
accretion rates, increases above the critical BH mass. These observational
trends can be natural consequences of the proposed scenario of suppressing BH
growth around the apparent maximum mass of $\sim 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$. The
ongoing VLA Sky Survey in radio will allow us to estimate of the exact number
fraction of RL quasars more precisely, which gives further insights to

to z=1 shows that, on average, 55 per cent of the halo mass in compact groups
is assembled since z~1, compared to 40 per cent of the halo mass in fossil
groups (FGs) in the same time interval, indicating that compared to FGs, CGs
are relatively younger galaxy systems. At z=0, for a given halo mass, fossil
groups tend to have a larger concentration than compact groups. Investigating
the evolution of CG's parameters show that they become more compact with time.
CGs at z=0.5 see their magnitude gaps increase exponentially, but it takes ~10
Gyr for them to reach a magnitude gap of 2 magnitudes. The slow growth of the
magnitude gap leads to only a minority (~41 per cent) of CGs selected at z=0.5
turning into a FG by z=0. Also, while three-quarters of FGs go through a
compact phase, most fail to meet the CG isolation criterion, leaving only ~30
per cent of FGs fully satisfying the CG selection criteria. Therefore, there is
no strong link of CGs turning into FGs or FGs originating from CGs. The
relation between CGs and FGs is thus more complex, and in most cases, FGs and
CGs follow different evolutionary tracks.

giant molecular clouds (GMCs), stellar clusters and high-redshift clumps as a
function of the galactic environment. Recent works have proposed that these
maximum masses are set by shearing motions and centrifugal forces, but we show
that this idea is inconsistent with the low masses observed across an important
range of local-Universe environments, such as low-surface density galaxies and
galaxy outskirts. Instead, we propose that feedback from young stars can
disrupt clouds before the global collapse of the shear-limited area is
completed. We develop a shear-feedback hybrid model that depends on three
observable quantities: the gas surface density, the epicylic frequency, and the
Toomre parameter. The model is tested in four galactic environments: the Milky
Way, the Local Group galaxy M31, the spiral galaxy M83, and the high-redshift
galaxy zC406690. We demonstrate that our model simultaneously reproduces the
observed maximum masses of GMCs, clumps and clusters in each of these
environments. We find that clouds and clusters in M31 and in the Milky Way are
feedback-limited beyond radii of 8.4 and 4 kpc, respectively, whereas the
masses in M83 and zC406690 are shear-limited at all radii. In zC406690, the
maximum cluster masses decrease further due to their inspiral by dynamical
friction. These results illustrate that the maximum masses change from being
shear-limited to being feedback-limited as galaxies become less gas-rich and
evolve towards low shear. This explains why high-redshift clumps are more
massive than GMCs in the Local Universe.

Main Sequence (SFMS). Comparison with IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies
do not require further obscuration in addition to the UV-based correction,
though our sample does not include the most heavily obscured, massive galaxies.
The individual rest-frame $V$-band dust attenuation (A$_{\rm V}$) radial
profiles scatter around an average profile that gently decreases from $\sim1.8$
mag in the center down to $\sim0.6$ mag at $\sim3-4$ half-mass radii. We use
these maps to correct UV- and H$\alpha$-based star-formation rates (SFRs),
which agree with each other. At masses $<10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the
dust-corrected specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at
a mass-doubling timescale of $\sim300~\mathrm{Myr}$, pointing at a synchronous
growth of bulge and disk components. At masses $>10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the sSFR
profiles are typically centrally-suppressed by a factor of $\sim10$ relative to
the galaxy outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates
that at least a fraction of massive $z\sim2$ SFMS galaxies have started their
inside-out star-formation quenching that will move them to the quenched
sequence. In combination with other observations, galaxies above and below the
ridge of the SFMS relation have respectively centrally-enhanced and
centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture
where bulges are built due to gas `compaction' that leads to a high central SFR
as galaxies move towards the upper envelope of SFMS.

stellar populations in the inner regions of disc galaxies, using N-body
simulations with both a thin (kinematically cold) and a thick (kinematically
hot) disc which form a bar and boxy/peanut (b/p) bulge. The bar in the thin
disc component is $\sim$50\% stronger than the thick disc bar and is more
elongated, with an axis ratio almost half that of the thick disc bar. The thin
disc b/p bulge has a pronounced X-shape, while the thick disc b/p is weaker
with a rather boxy shape. This leads to the signature of the b/p bulge in the
thick disc to be weaker and further away from the plane than in the thin disc.
Regarding the kinematics, we find that the los velocity of thick disc stars in
the outer parts of the b/p bulge can be \emph{larger} than that of thin disc
stars, by up to 40\% and 20\% for side-on and Milky Way-like orientations of
the bar respectively. This is due to the different orbits followed by thin and
thick disc stars in the bar-b/p region, which are affected by the fact that: i)
thin disc stars are trapped more efficiently in the bar - b/p instability and
thus lose more angular momentum than their thick disc counterparts and ii)
thick disc stars have large radial excursions and therefore stars from large
radii with high angular momenta can be found in the bar region. We also find
that the difference between the los velocities of the thin and thick disc in
the b/p bulge ($\Delta v_{los}$) correlates with the initial difference between
the radial velocity dispersions of the two discs ($\Delta \sigma$) . We
therefore conclude that stars in the bar - b/p bulge will have considerably
different morphologies and kinematics depending on the kinematic properties of
the disc population they originate from.

while five polytropic segments are needed for maximum flexibility in the
absence of any prior knowledge of the EoS, regularizers are also necessary to
ensure that simple underlying EoS are not over-parametrized. For ideal data
with small measurement uncertainties, we show that the pressure at roughly
twice the nuclear saturation density, rho_sat, can be inferred to within 0.3
dex for many realizations of potential sources of uncertainties. The pressures
of more complicated EoS with significant phase transitions can also be inferred
to within ~30%. We also find that marginalizing the multi-dimensional parameter
space of pressure to infer a mass-radius relation can lead to biases of nearly
1 km in radius, towards larger radii. Using the full, five-dimensional
posterior likelihoods avoids this bias.

Assuming that this is a continuous transition, analytic results show that the
length scale should diverge with a critical exponent $\nu \ge 2$ in one
dimensional systems. Interestingly, this is in stark contrast with all exact
numerical studies which find $\nu \sim 1$. We introduce the Schmidt gap, new in
this context, which scales near the transition with a exponent $\nu > 2$
compatible with the analytical bound. We attribute this to an insensitivity to
certain finite size fluctuations, which remain significant in other quantities

a physical manifestation of the diverging length scale is apparent in the
entanglement length computed using the logarithmic negativity between disjoint

corresponding to a non-monotonic behavior in the friction law $\mu(I)$, is
present even if the dynamic and static microscopic friction coefficients are
identical, but disappears for softer particles. We argue that this instability
is induced by endogenous acoustic noise, which tends to make contacts slide,
leading to faster flow and increased noise. We show that soft spots, or
excitable regions in the materials, correspond to rolling contacts that are
about to slide, whose density is described by a nontrivial exponent $\theta_s$.
We build a microscopic theory for the non-monotonicity of $\mu(I)$, which also
predicts the scaling behavior of acoustic noise, the fraction of sliding

these quantities have no limit when particles become infinitely hard, as

matched filtering a modeled template against the noisy gravitational-wave data

signal-to-noise ratio) if the signal deviates from the template. One possible
instance in which this may occur is if the neutron star undergoes a glitch, a
sudden rapid increase in the rotation frequency seen in the timing of many

glitch rate and size in radio pulsars to estimate how often neutron star
glitches would occur within the parameter space of continuous
gravitational-wave searches and how much mismatch putative signals would suffer
in the search due to these glitches. We find that for many previous and
potential future searches continuous-wave signals have an elevated probability
of undergoing one or more glitches and that these glitches will often lead to a
substantial fraction of the signal-to-noise ratio being lost. This could lead
to a failure to identify candidate gravitational-wave signals in the initial

energy generation necessitates faster and more sophisticated voltage controls.
Unfortunately, recent research shows that local voltage control fails in
achieving the desired regulation, unless there is communication between the
controllers. However, the communication infrastructure for distribution systems
is less reliable and less ubiquitous as compared to that for the bulk
transmission system. In this paper, we design distributed voltage control that
uses limited communication. That is, only neighboring buses need to communicate
a few bits between each other for each control step. We investigate how these
controllers can achieve the desired asymptotic behavior of the voltage
regulation and we provide upper bounds on the number of bits that are needed to
ensure a predefined accuracy of the regulation. Finally, we illustrate the
results by numerical simulations.

(BHs) and galaxies form and assemble, sowing the seeds of galaxies as we know
them today. Detecting, identifying and understand- ing the first galaxies and
BHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy
formation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at
galaxies, BHs and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model
builds a population based on empirical relations. Galaxies are characterized by
a spectral energy distribution determined by age and metallicity, and AGNs by a
spectral energy distribution determined by BH mass and accretion rate. We
validate the model against observational constraints, and then predict
properties of galaxies and AGN in other wavelength and/or luminosity ranges,
estimating the contamination of stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass
X-ray binaries) for AGN searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice-versa
for galaxy searches. For high-redshift galaxies, with stellar ages < 1 Gyr, we
find that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at restframe
UV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become more important
sources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a color-color selection in JWST
bands to separate AGN vs star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations.
We also esti- mate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot,
metal-poor stars, at driving high ionization lines, such as C IV and He II.
Finally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupa- tion fraction
of BHs in low mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and X-ray AGN
luminosity function.

recognition tasks, as they reduce the search space dramatically. Most

predefined object detectors (e.g., human detector) to refine and score the
action proposals, but they require thousands of manual annotations to train.
  Given the action proposals in a video, the goal of the proposed work is to
generate a few better action proposals that are ranked properly. In our
approach, we first divide action proposal into sub-proposal and then use
Dynamic Programming based graph optimization scheme to select the optimal
combinations of sub-proposals from different proposals and assign each new
proposal a score. We propose a new unsupervised image-based actioness detector
that leverages web images and employs it as one of the node scores in our graph
formulation. Moreover, we capture motion information by estimating the number
of motion contours within each action proposal patch. The proposed method is an
unsupervised method that neither needs bounding box annotations nor video level
labels, which is desirable with the current explosion of large-scale action
datasets. Our approach is generic and does not depend on a specific action
proposal method. We evaluate our approach on several publicly available trimmed
and un-trimmed datasets and obtain better performance compared to several
proposal ranking methods. In addition, we demonstrate that properly ranked
proposals produce significantly better action detection as compared to
state-of-the-art proposal based methods.

considering a $12$ parameter extended scenario, we find that: a) the tension on
the Hubble constant can indeed be solved with dynamical dark energy, b) a
cosmological constant is ruled out at more than $95 \%$ c.l. by the Planck+R16
dataset, and c) all of the standard quintessence and half of the ""downward

decreases with time) is also excluded at more than $95 \%$ c.l. These results
are further confirmed when cosmic shear, CMB lensing, or SN~Ia luminosity
distance data are also included. However, tension remains with the BAO dataset.
A cosmological constant and small portion of the freezing quintessence models
are still in agreement with the Planck+R16+BAO dataset at between 68\% and 95\%

heating of plasmonically active nanowires at substrate temperatures from 5 to
60 K. The increase of the local temperature of the nanowire is quantified by a
bolometric approach and could be as large as 100 K for a substrate temperature
of 5 K and typical values of laser intensity. We also demonstrate that a $\sim
3\times$ reduction of the local temperature increase is possible by switching
to a sapphire or quartz substrate. Finite element modeling of the heat
dissipation reveals that the local temperature increase of the nanowire at
temperatures below $\sim$50 K is determined largely by the thermal boundary
resistance of the metal-substrate interface. The model reproduces the striking
experimental trend that in this regime the temperature of the nanowire varies
nonlinearly with the incident optical power. The thermal boundary resistance is
demonstrated to be a major constraint on reaching low temperatures necessary to
perform simultaneous inelastic electron tunneling and surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopies.

of exception handling features, the misuse of them can still cause catastrophic
software failures, such as application crash. Prior studies suggested
anti-patterns of exception handling; while little knowledge was shared about
the prevalence of these anti-patterns. In this paper, we investigate the
prevalence of exception-handling anti-patterns. We collected a thorough list of
exception anti-patterns from 16 open-source Java and C# libraries and
applications using an automated exception flow analysis tool. We found that
although exception handling anti- patterns widely exist in all of our subjects,
only a few anti- patterns (e.g. Unhandled Exceptions, Catch Generic,
Unreachable Handler, Over-catch, and Destructive Wrapping) can be commonly
identified. On the other hand, we find that the prevalence of anti- patterns
illustrates differences between C# and Java. Our results call for further

$\lambda_{1}\geq\lambda_{2}\geq\cdots\geq\lambda_{n}$, the energy of the graph
is defined by $E(G)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}|\lambda_{j}|$. Myriads of papers have been
published in the mathematical and chemistry literature about properties of this
graph invariant due to its connection with the energy of (bipartite) conjugated
molecules. However, a structural interpretation of this concept in terms of the
contributions of even and odd walks, and consequently on the contribution of
subgraphs, is not yet known. Here, we find such interpretation and prove that
the (adjacency) energy of any graph (bipartite or not) is a weighted sum of the
traces of even powers of the adjacency matrix. We then use such result to find
bounds for the energy in terms of subgraphs contributing to it. The new bounds
are studied for some specific simple graphs, such as cycles and fullerenes. We
observe that including contributions from subgraphs of sizes not bigger than 6
improves some of the best known bounds for the energy, and more importantly
gives insights about the contributions of specific subgraphs to the energy of

possible principles to determine that function. These lead to behaviour that,

the case of the latter, the edge modes are resistant to a much larger class of

cavity of roughly 120 AU in radius, and asymmetric dust and gas emission. By
comparing the observations with theoretical models, we find that the azimuthal
variations in gas and dust density reach a contrast of 54 for dust grains and
3.75 for CO molecules, with an extreme gas-to-dust ratio of 1.7 on the dust
crescent. We point out that caution is required in interpreting continuum
subtracted maps of the line emission as this process might result in removing a
large fraction of the line emission. Radially, we find that both the gas and
dust surface densities can be described by Gaussians, centered at the same disk
radius, and with gas profiles wider than for the dust. These results strongly
support a scenario in which millimeter dust grains are radially and azimuthally
trapped toward the center of a gas pressure bump. Finally, our observations
reveal a compact source of continuum and CO emission inside the dust depleted
cavity at about 50 AU from the primary star. The kinematics of the CO emission
from this region is different from that expected from material in Keplerian
rotation around the binary system, and might instead trace a compact disk

the high background and low signal-to-noise ratio of the single-photon based
imaging used in this technique, extraction of neural signals from the large
numbers of imaged cells automatically has remained challenging. Here we
describe a highly accurate framework for automatically identifying activated
neurons and extracting calcium signals from the miniscope imaging data, seeds
cleansing Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (sc-CNMF). This sc-CNMF
extends the conventional CNMF with two new modules: i) a neural enhancing
module to overcome miniscope-specific limitations, and ii) a seeds cleansing
module combining LSTM to rigorously select and cleanse the set of seeds for
detecting regions-of-interest. Our sc-CNMF yields highly stable and superior
performance in analyzing miniscope calcium imaging data compared to existing

address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by

taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models

approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the
clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel.
  We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other
state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK
is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without

with synchronization errors, i.e., insertions and deletions. Synchronization
errors are strictly more general and much harder to deal with than commonly
considered half-errors, i.e., symbol corruptions and erasures. For every
$\epsilon >0$, synchronization strings allow to index a sequence with an
$\epsilon^{-O(1)}$ size alphabet such that one can efficiently transform $k$
synchronization errors into $(1+\epsilon)k$ half-errors. This powerful new
technique has many applications. In this paper, we focus on designing insdel
codes, i.e., error correcting block codes (ECCs) for insertion deletion
channels.
  While ECCs for both half-errors and synchronization errors have been
intensely studied, the later has largely resisted progress. Indeed, it took
until 1999 for the first insdel codes with constant rate, constant distance,
and constant alphabet size to be constructed by Schulman and Zuckerman. Insdel
codes for asymptotically large or small noise rates were given in 2016 by
Guruswami et al. but these codes are still polynomially far from the optimal
rate-distance tradeoff. This makes the understanding of insdel codes up to this
work equivalent to what was known for regular ECCs after Forney introduced
concatenated codes in his doctoral thesis 50 years ago.
  A direct application of our synchronization strings based indexing method
gives a simple black-box construction which transforms any ECC into an equally
efficient insdel code with a slightly larger alphabet size. This instantly
transfers much of the highly developed understanding for regular ECCs over
large constant alphabets into the realm of insdel codes. Most notably, we
obtain efficient insdel codes which get arbitrarily close to the optimal
rate-distance tradeoff given by the Singleton bound for the complete noise
spectrum.

the mass ratio and spins of the progenitor binary black hole using the results

the spin of the primary black hole must be $\alpha_2=S_2/m_2^2>0.4$. The final
remnant of the merger is bounded by $\alpha_f>0.45$ and at least $4\%$ of the
total mass of the binary system is radiated into gravitational waves. We
consider four different pre-merger scenarios that further narrow those values.

binary had comparable masses with $q=0.70^{+0.29}_{-0.21}$ and the normalized

$\alpha_2=0.94^{+0.06}_{-0.22}$ and $\alpha_1=0.95^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$. We can

of a finite adiabatic temperature gradient $\nabla T_{\rm{ad}}$ and use mixed
boundary conditions for the temperature with fixed flux at the inner boundary
and fixed temperature at the outer boundary. This setup is intrinsically more
asymmetric than the more standard case of Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection in
liquids between parallel plates with fixed temperature boundary conditions.
Conditions where there is substantial asymmetry can cause a dramatic change in
the nature of convection and we demonstrate that this is the case here. The
flows can become pressure- rather than buoyancy- dominated leading to anomalous
heat transport by upflows. Counter-intuitively, the background temperature
gradient $\nabla\bar{T}$ can develop a subadiabatic layer (where
$\boldsymbol{g}\cdot\nabla\bar{T}<\boldsymbol{g}\cdot\nabla T_{\rm{ad}}$, where
$\boldsymbol{g}$ is gravity) although convection remains vigorous at every
point across the shell. This indicates a high degree of non-locality.

observations with the IRAM 30m telescope reveal in total ~ 10^9 M_sun of H_2
(assuming the standard CO-to-H_2 conversion) in several regions along the tail,
thus indicating that molecular gas may dominate its mass. Along the tail we
measure a smooth gradient in the radial velocity of the CO emission that is
offset to lower values from the more diffuse H{\alpha} gas velocities. Such a
dynamic separation of phases may be due to their differential acceleration by
ram pressure. D100 is likely being stripped at a high orbital velocity >2200
km/s by (nearly) peak ram pressure. Combined effects of ICM viscosity and
magnetic fields may be important for the evolution of the stripped ISM. We
propose D100 has reached a continuous mode of stripping of dense gas remaining
in its nuclear region. D100 is the second known case of an abundant molecular
stripped-gas tail, suggesting that conditions in the ICM at the centers of
galaxy clusters may be favorable for molecularization. From comparison with
other galaxies, we find there is a good correlation between the CO flux and the
H{\alpha} surface brightness in ram pressure stripped gas tails, over about 2
dex.

a result, the explicit time dependence of the system as a function of its

builds on the latter category by implementing a year-long, continuous,

for 30m resolution, 16-day frequency reflectance data from the Landsat
satellite. In this work we adapt the algorithm to 1km, 16-day frequency
reflectance data from the modis sensor aboard the Terra satellite. The CMFDA
algorithm is composed of two submodels which are fitted on a pixel-by-pixel
basis. The first estimates the amount of surface reflectance as a function of
the day of the year. The second estimates the occurrence of a deforestation
event by comparing the last few predicted and real reflectance values. For this
comparison, the reflectance observations for six different bands are first
combined into a forest index. Real and predicted values of the forest index are
then compared and high absolute differences for consecutive observation dates
are flagged as deforestation events. Our adapted algorithm also uses the two
model framework. However, since the modis 13A2 dataset used, includes
reflectance data for different spectral bands than those included in the
Landsat dataset, we cannot construct the forest index. Instead we propose two
contrasting approaches: a multivariate and an index approach similar to that of
CMFDA.

to belong to a given convex compact set ${\cal X}$ from indirect observation
$\omega=Ax+\xi$ of $x$ corrupted by random noise $\xi$ with finite covariance
matrix. It is shown that under some assumptions on ${\cal X}$ (satisfied, e.g.,
when ${\cal X}$ is the intersection of $K$ concentric ellipsoids/elliptic
cylinders, or the unit ball of the spectral norm in the space of matrices) and
on the norm $\|\cdot\|$ used to measure the recovery error (satisfied, e.g., by
$\|\cdot\|_p$-norms, $1\leq p\leq 2$, on ${\mathbf{R}}^m$ and by the nuclear
norm on the space of matrices), one can build, in a computationally efficient
manner, a ""presumably good"" linear in observations estimate, and that in the
case of zero mean Gaussian observation noise, this estimate is near-optimal
among all (linear and nonlinear) estimates in terms of its worst-case, over
$x\in {\cal X}$, expected $\|\cdot\|$-loss. These results form an essential
extension of those in our paper arXiv:1602.01355, where the assumptions on
${\cal X}$ were more restrictive, and the norm $\|\cdot\|$ was assumed to be
the Euclidean one. In addition, we develop near-optimal estimates for the case
of ""uncertain-but-bounded"" noise, where all we know about $\xi$ is that it is
bounded in a given norm by a given $\sigma$. Same as in arXiv:1602.01355, our

q\operatorname{mod}\mathcal{J}$, then $D(q)$ does not depend on $q$ (as long as
$\beta$, $\alpha$ and $p$ are fixed). Thus, reducing a $p\in\mathcal{X}$ modulo
$\mathcal{J}$ may lead to different results depending on the choices made in
the reduction process, but all of them become identical once $D$ is applied. We
also find an actual basis of the $\mathbf{k}$-module $\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{J}$,
using what we call forkless monomials.

is an excellent tool to probe its aerosols content without being affected by

requires a high resolution calibration and limits the number of images
available in the Cassini dataset. However, we show that it is possible to
extract on each profile the local maximum of intensity of this layer and
confirm its stability at $500 \pm 8$ km during the 2005-2007 period for all
latitudes lower than 45$^\circ$N. Using the fractal aggregate scattering model
of Tomasko et al. (2008) and a single scattering radiative transfer model, it
is possible to derive the optical properties required to explain the
observations made at different phase angles. Our results indicates that the
aerosols have at least ten monomers of 60 nm radius, while the typical
tangential column number density is about $2\cdot 10^{10}$ agg.m$^{-2}$.
Moreover, we demonstrate that these properties are constant within the error
bars in the southern hemisphere of Titan over the observed time period. In the
northern hemisphere, the size of the aerosols tend to decrease relatively to
the southern hemisphere and are associated with a higher tangential opacity.
However, the lower number of observations available in this region due to the
orbital constraints is a limiting factor in the accuracy of these results.
Assuming a fixed homogeneous content we notice that the tangential opacity can
fluctuate up to a factor 3 among the observations at the equator. These
variations could be linked with short scale temporal and/or longitudinal events
changing the local density of the layer.

decades remains a mystery. However, it is believed that correlations between
observable GRB properties given their huge luminosity/radiated energy and
redshift distribution extending up to at least $z \approx 9$, are promising
possible cosmological tools. They also may help to discriminate among the most
plausible theoretical models. Nowadays, the objective is to make GRBs standard
candles, similar to supernovae (SNe) Ia, through well-established and robust
correlations. However, differently from SNe Ia, GRBs span over several order of
magnitude in their energetics and hence cannot yet be considered standard
candles. Additionally, being observed at very large distances their physical
properties are affected by selection biases, the so called Malmquist bias or
Eddington effect. We describe the state of the art on how GRB prompt
correlations are corrected for these selection biases in order to employ them
as redshift estimators and cosmological tools. We stress that only after an
appropriate evaluation and correction for these effects, the GRB correlations
can be used to discriminate among the theoretical models of prompt emission, to
estimate the cosmological parameters and to serve as distance indicators via
redshift estimation.

practice, has been driven mainly by issues related to service cost and
complexity of commercial cloud providers (e.g., Amazon) employing massive data
centers. However, the resource inelasticity problem faced by the SCs due to
their relatively scarce resources (e.g., virtual machines) might lead to a
potential degradation of customer QoS and loss of revenue. A proposed solution
to this problem recommends the sharing of resources between competing SCs to
alleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise [1]. Based on this
idea, a recent effort ([2]) proposed SC-Share, a performance-driven static
market model for competitive small cloud environments that results in an
efficient market equilibrium jointly optimizing customer QoS satisfaction and
SC revenue generation. However, an important non-obvious question still remains
to be answered, without which SC sharing markets may not be guaranteed to
sustain in the long-run - is it still possible to achieve a stable market
efficient state when the supply of SC resources is dynamic in nature and there
is a variation of customer demand over time? In this paper, we address the
problem of efficient market design for SC resource sharing in dynamic

Chriss, Bertsimas and Lo in the late 90's. Its main application is slicing
large trading orders, in the interest of minimizing trading costs and potential
perturbations of price dynamics due to liquidity shocks. The initial
optimization frameworks were based on mean-variance minimization for the
trading costs. In the past 15 years, finer modelling of price dynamics, more
realistic control variables and different cost functionals were developed. The
inclusion of signals (i.e. short term predictors of price dynamics) in optimal
trading is a recent development and it is also the subject of this work.
  We incorporate a Markovian signal in the optimal trading framework which was
initially proposed by Gatheral, Schied, and Slynko [21] and provide results on
the existence and uniqueness of an optimal trading strategy. Moreover, we
derive an explicit singular optimal strategy for the special case of an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck signal and an exponentially decaying transient market
impact. The combination of a mean-reverting signal along with a market impact
decay is of special interest, since they affect the short term price variations
in opposite directions.
  Later, we show that in the asymptotic limit were the transient market impact
becomes instantaneous, the optimal strategy becomes continuous. This result is
compatible with the optimal trading framework which was proposed by Cartea and
Jaimungal [10].
  In order to support our models, we analyse nine months of tick by tick data
on 13 European stocks from the NASDAQ OMX exchange. We show that orderbook
imbalance is a predictor of the future price move and it has some
mean-reverting properties. From this data we show that market participants,
especially high frequency traders, use this signal in their trading strategies.

determined by the size of the spectral gap of the corresponding Markov
operator. However, calculating (and even approximating) the spectral gaps of
practical Monte Carlo Markov chains in statistics has proven to be an extremely
difficult and often insurmountable task, especially when these chains move on
continuous state spaces. In this paper, a method for accurate estimation of the
spectral gap is developed for general state space Markov chains whose operators
are non-negative and trace-class. The method is based on the fact that the
second largest eigenvalue (and hence the spectral gap) of such operators can be
bounded above and below by simple functions of the power sums of the
eigenvalues. These power sums often have nice integral representations. A
classical Monte Carlo method is proposed to estimate these integrals, and a
simple sufficient condition for finite variance is provided. This leads to
asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the second largest eigenvalue
(and the spectral gap) of the Markov operator. In contrast with previously
existing techniques, our method is not based on a near-stationary version of
the Markov chain, which, paradoxically, cannot be obtained in a principled
manner without bounds on the spectral gap. On the other hand, it can be quite
expensive from a computational standpoint. The efficiency of the method is
studied both theoretically and empirically.

were used to calculate the orbital period and new ephemerides of the eclipsing
system. The analysis of $O-C$ diagram reveals that the orbital period is
$0.58520481\ days$, decreasing at a rate of $dP/dt=-7.80\times10^{-8} d\
yr^{-1} $. The mass transfer between the two components and the light
time-travel effect due to a third body could be used to explain the period
decrease. However, a semidetached configuration with the less-mass component
filling and the primary nearly filling each of their Roche lobes was derived
from the synthesis of the light and radial velocity curves by using the 2015
version of the Wilson-Devinney code. We consider the period decrease to be the
nonconservative mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary and
the mass loss of the system, which was thought to be an EB type while it should
be an EA type (semi-detached Algol-type) from our study. The masses, radii and
luminosities of the primary and secondary are $1.60\pm0.07 M_\odot$,
$1.64\pm0.02 R_\odot$, $14.14\pm0.73 L_\odot$ and $0.74\pm0.02 M_\odot$,
$1.23\pm0.02 R_\odot$, $1.65\pm0.05 L_\odot$, respectively.

automated vehicles before they completely meet real-world operational
conditions. This paper introduces an `indirect shared control' scheme for
steer-by-wire vehicles, which allows the vehicle control authority to be
continuously shared between the driver and automation through unphysical
cooperation. This paper first balances the control objectives of the driver and
automation in a weighted summation, and then models the driver's adaptive
control behavior using a predictive control approach. The driver adaptation
modeling enables off-line evaluations of indirect shared control systems and
thus facilitates the design of the assistant controller. Unlike any
conventional driver model for manual driving, this model assumes that the
driver can learn and incorporate the controller strategy into his internal
model for more accurate path following. To satisfy the driving demands in
different scenarios, a sliding-window detector is designed to continuously
monitor the driver intention and automatically switch the authority weights
between the driver and automation. The simulation results illustrate the
advantages of considering the driver adaptation in path-following and
obstacle-avoidance tasks, and show the effectiveness of indirect shared control
for cooperative driving.

Engineering for SASs primarily aims to model adaptation logic and mechanisms.
Requirements models will guide the design decisions and runtime behaviors of

adaptation against non-functional requirements (NFRs), i.e. reliability and
performances. The approach begins with the models in RE stage and provides
runtime support for self-adaptation. We capture adaptation mechanisms as
graphical elements in the goal model. By assigning reliability and performance
attributes to related system tasks, we derive the tagged sequential diagram for
specifying the reliability and performances of system behaviors. To formalize
system behavior, we transform the requirements model to the corresponding
behavior model, expressed by Label Transition Systems (LTS). To analyze the
reliability requirements and performance requirements, we merged the sequential
diagram and LTS to a variable Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) and a variable
Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) respectively. Adaptation candidates are
characterized by the variable states. The optimal decision is derived by
verifying the concerned NFRs and reducing the decision space. Our approach is
implemented through the demonstration of a mobile information system.

decays approximately linearly in the low-voltage region, approaching the Li

embedded, the ability of adaptation is highly demanded by many
software-intensive systems. Two concerns, i.e., the requirements uncertainty
and the context uncertainty are most important among others at Requirements
Engineering (RE) stage. However, requirements analyzers can hardly figure out
the mathematical relation between requirements, system behavior and context,
especially for complex and nonlinear systems, due to the existence of above
uncertainties, misunderstanding and ambiguity of prior knowledge. An essential
issue to be addressed is how to model and specify these uncertainties at RE
stage and how to utilize the prior knowledge to achieve adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a fuzzy-based approach to modeling uncertainty and achieving
evolution. The approach introduces specifications to describe fuzziness. Based
on the specifications, we derive a series of reasoning rules as knowledge base
for achieving adaptation and evolution. These two targets are implemented
through four reasoning schemas from a control theory perspective. Specifically,
forward reasoning schema is used for direct adaptation; backward reasoning
schema is used for optimal adaptation. Parameter-identified schema implements
learning evolution by considering SAS as the gray-box system, while
system-identified reasoning schema implements learning evolution by considering
SAS as the gray-box system. The former two schemas function as the control
group, while the latter two are de-signed as the experimental groups to
illustrate the learning ability. Our approach is implemented under three types
of context through the demonstration of a mobile computing application.

decreasing the duty cycle ($f_{D}$) of switched biasing signal. In this paper,
an extended analysis of this 1/\textit{f} noise reduction model is presented

corner frequency ($f_{c}$) of the 1/\textit{f} noise and the value of shift is
a function of continuous ON time ({$T_{on}$}) of the device. This 1/\textit{f}

showed a complicated three-ribbon structure. To clarify the trigger process of

analyzed the data from Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope and the Solar Dynamics

investigated the spatio-temporal correlation between the magnetic field
structures, especially the non-potentiality of the horizontal field, and the
bright structures in the solar atmosphere. As a result, we determined that the
western side of the positive polarity, which is intruding on a negative
polarity region, is the location where the flare was triggered. This is due to
the fact that the sign of the magnetic shear in that region was opposite that
of the major shear of the AR, and the significant brightenings were observed
over the polarity inversion line (PIL) in that region before flare onset. These
features are consistent with the recently proposed flare-trigger model that
suggests that small reversed shear (RS) magnetic disturbances can trigger solar
flares. Moreover, we found that the RS field was located slightly off the
flaring PIL, contrary to the theoretical prediction. We discuss the possibility
of an extension of the RS model based on an extra numerical simulation. Our
result suggests that the RS field has a certain flexibility for displacement
from a highly sheared PIL, and that the RS field triggers more flares than we
expected.

appear consistent with noise after accounting for differences in angular
resolution and filtering. We then calculate (1) the cross-spectrum between two
independent halves of SPT data, (2) the cross-spectrum between two independent
halves of Planck data, and (3) the cross-spectrum between SPT and Planck data.
We find the three cross-spectra are well-fit (PTE = 0.30) by the null
hypothesis in which both experiments have measured the same sky map up to a
single free calibration parameter---i.e., we find no evidence for systematic
errors in either data set. As a by-product, we improve the precision of the SPT
calibration by nearly an order of magnitude, from 2.6% to 0.3% in power.
Finally, we compare all three cross-spectra to the full-sky Planck power
spectrum and find marginal evidence for differences between the power spectra
from the SPT-SZ footprint and the full sky. We model these differences as a
power law in spherical harmonic multipole number. The best-fit value of this
tilt is consistent among the three cross-spectra in the SPT-SZ footprint,
implying that the source of this tilt is a sample variance fluctuation in the
SPT-SZ region relative to the full sky. The consistency of cosmological

terms of node position, network connectivity and link metric. However, their
dynamics are almost predictable compared with the ad-hoc network. The existing
routing protocols specific to static or ad-hoc network do not consider this
predictability and thus are not very efficient for some cases.
  We present a topology model based on Divide-and-Merge methodology to
formulate the dynamic topology into the series of static topologies, which can
reflect the topology dynamics correctly with the least number of static
topologies. Then we design a dynamic programing algorithm to solve that model
and determine the timing of routing update and the topology to be used.
Besides, for the classic predictable dynamic network---space Internet, the
links at some region have shorter delay, which leads to most traffic converge
at these links. Meanwhile, the connectivity and metric of these links
continuously vary, which results in a great end-to-end path variations and
routing updates. In this paper, we propose a stable routing scheme which adds
link life-time into its metric to eliminate these dynamics. And then we take
use of the Dijkstra's greedy feature to release some paths from the dynamic
link, achieving the goal of routing stability. Experimental results show that
our method can significantly decrease the number of changed paths and affected
network nodes, and then greatly improve the network stability. Interestingly,
our method can also achieve better network performance, including the less
number of loss packets, smoother variation of end-to-end delay and higher
throughput.

a reduced version, where the tangential component on each simplicial edge ($d =

the orientation directly with respect to the North-East-Down frame. A key
contribution of the paper is to present a rigorous stability analysis showing
that the attitude estimates of the observer converge exponentially to the true
attitude and to provide a lower bound for the convergence rate of the observer.
Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that the observer effectively
compensates for the inherent drift of the pure monocular vision based attitude
estimation and is able to recover the North-East-Down orientation even if it is

number of important advantages over previous methods, such as WHAM. Despite its

learning models has been better than the traditional baselines for such tasks,
little is known about the elementary properties of a tweet encoded within these
representations, or why particular representations work better for certain
tasks. Our work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the
black-box of vector embeddings for tweets. Traditional feature engineering
methods for high-level applications have exploited various elementary
properties of tweets. We believe that a tweet representation is effective for
an application because it meticulously encodes the application-specific
elementary properties of tweets. To understand the elementary properties
encoded in a tweet representation, we evaluate the representations on the
accuracy to which they can model each of those properties such as tweet length,
presence of particular words, hashtags, mentions, capitalization, etc. Our
systematic extensive study of nine supervised and four unsupervised tweet
representations against most popular eight textual and five social elementary
properties reveal that Bi-directional LSTMs (BLSTMs) and Skip-Thought Vectors
(STV) best encode the textual and social properties of tweets respectively.
FastText is the best model for low resource settings, providing very little
degradation with reduction in embedding size. Finally, we draw interesting
insights by correlating the model performance obtained for elementary property
prediction tasks with the highlevel downstream applications.

best performance under dark conditions, i.e. in absence of moonlight or
twilight. Since operating the telescopes only during dark time would severely
limit the duty cycle, observations are also performed when the Moon is present
in the sky. Here we develop a dedicated Moon-adapted analysis to characterize
the performance of MAGIC under moonlight. We evaluate energy threshold, angular
resolution and sensitivity of MAGIC under different background light levels,
based on Crab Nebula observations and tuned Monte Carlo simulations. This study
includes observations taken under non-standard hardware configurations, such as
reducing the camera photomultiplier tubes gain by a factor ~1.7 (Reduced HV
settings) with respect to standard settings (Nominal HV) or using UV-pass
filters to strongly reduce the amount of moonlight reaching the cameras of the
telescopes. The Crab Nebula spectrum is correctly reconstructed in all the
studied illumination levels, that reach up to 30 times brighter than under dark
conditions. The main effect of moonlight is an increase in the analysis energy
threshold and in the systematic uncertainties on the flux normalization. The
sensitivity degradation is constrained to be below 10%, within 15-30% and
between 60 and 80% for Nominal HV, Reduced HV and UV-pass filter observations,
respectively. No worsening of the angular resolution was found. Thanks to
observations during moonlight, the maximal duty cycle of MAGIC can be increased
from ~18%, under dark nights only, to up to ~40% in total with only moderate
performance degradation.

  Study, Performance Analysis, and Multiple-Symbol Detection",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we analytically study the bit error rate (BER) performance of
underwater visible light communication (UVLC) systems with binary pulse
position modulation (BPPM). We simulate the channel fading-free impulse
response (FFIR) based on Monte Carlo numerical method to take into account the
absorption and scattering effects. Additionally, to characterize turbulence
effects, we multiply the aforementioned FFIR by a fading coefficient which for
weak oceanic turbulence can be modeled as a lognormal random variable (RV).
Moreover, to mitigate turbulence effects, we employ multiple transmitters
and/or receivers, i.e., spatial diversity technique over UVLC links.
Closed-form expressions for the system BER are provided, when equal gain
combiner (EGC) is employed at the receiver side, thanks to Gauss-Hermite
quadrature formula and approximation to the sum of lognormal RVs. We further
apply saddle-point approximation, an accurate photon-counting-based method, to
evaluate the system BER in the presence of shot noise. Both laser-based
collimated and light emitting diode (LED)-based diffusive links are
investigated. Since multiple-scattering effect of UVLC channels on the
propagating photons causes considerable inter-symbol interference (ISI),
especially for diffusive channels, we also obtain the optimum multiple-symbol
detection (MSD) algorithm to significantly alleviate ISI effects and improve
the system performance. Our numerical analysis indicates good matches between
the analytical and photon-counting results implying the negligibility of
signal-dependent shot noise, and also between analytical results and numerical
simulations confirming the accuracy of our derived closed-form expressions for
the system BER. Besides, our results show that spatial diversity significantly
mitigates fading impairments while MSD considerably alleviates ISI
deteriorations.

reproduce the clustering of DM halos once the grouping of particles into halos
is defined and kept fixed. The following methods have been considered:
Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) up to third order, Truncated LPT,
Augmented LPT, MUSCLE and COLA. The test runs as follows: halos are defined by
applying a friends-of-friends (FoF) halo finder to the output of an N-body
simulation. The approximate methods are then applied to the same initial
conditions of the simulation, producing for all particles displacements from
their starting position and velocities. The position and velocity of each halo
are computed by averaging over the particles that belong to that halo,
according to the FoF halo finder. This procedure allows us to perform a
well-posed test of how clustering of the matter density and halo density fields
are recovered, without asking to the approximate method an accurate
reconstruction of halos. We have considered the results at $z=0,0.5,1$, and we
have analysed power spectrum in real and redshift space, object-by-object
difference in position and velocity, density Probability Distribution Function
(PDF) and its moments, phase difference of Fourier modes. We find that higher
LPT orders are generally able to better reproduce the clustering of halos,

to 2LPT and 3LPT. Augmentation provides some improvement when coupled with
2LPT, while its effect is limited when coupled with 3LPT. Little improvement is

dynamics of an electron valley in monolayer MoS_{2} by using real-time

uniform magnetic field in dimension $d \le 3$, we study the possibility to
construct spanning sets of exponentially localized (generalized) Wannier
functions for the space of occupied states. When the magnetic flux per unit
cell satisfies a certain rationality condition, by going to the momentum-space
description one can model $m$ occupied energy bands by a real-analytic and
$\mathbb Z^{d}$-periodic family $\{P({\bf k})\}_{{\bf k} \in \mathbb R^{d}}$ of
orthogonal projections of rank $m$. A moving orthonormal basis of $\mathrm{Ran}
P({\bf k})$ consisting of real-analytic and $\mathbb Z^d$-periodic Bloch
vectors can be constructed if and only if the first Chern number(s) of $P$
vanish(es). Here we are mainly interested in the topologically obstructed case.
First, by dropping the generating condition, we show how to algorithmically
construct a collection of $m-1$ orthonormal, real-analytic, and periodic Bloch
vectors. Second, by dropping the linear independence condition, we construct a
Parseval frame of $m+1$ real-analytic and periodic Bloch vectors which generate
$\mathrm{Ran} P({\bf k})$. Both algorithms are based on a two-step logarithm
method which produces a moving orthonormal basis in the topologically trivial
case. A moving Parseval frame of analytic, periodic Bloch vectors corresponds
to a Parseval frame of exponentially localized composite Wannier functions. We
extend this construction to the case of magnetic Hamiltonians with an
irrational magnetic flux per unit cell and show how to produce Parseval frames
of exponentially localized generalized Wannier functions also in this setting.
Our results are illustrated in crystalline insulators modelled by $2d$ discrete
Hofstadter-like Hamiltonians, but apply to certain continuous models of
magnetic Schr\""{o}dinger operators as well.

driven by the internal potential energy of the ion. It is based on an effective
model of the Anderson-Newns-type for the subset of electronic states of the

approach is a pseudo-particle representation for the electronic configurations
of the projectile which enables us, by combining it with two additional

involving electronic configurations with different internal potential energies.
It is thus possible to treat Auger neutralization of the ion on an equal
footing with Auger de-excitation of temporarily formed radicals and/or negative
ions. From the Dyson equations for the projectile propagators and an
approximate evaluation of the self-energies, rate equations are obtained for
the probabilities with which the projectile configurations occur and an
electron is emitted in the course of the collision. Encouraging numerical
results, especially for the helium-tungsten system, indicate the potential of
the approach.

is particularly interesting since it shows linear-$T$-resistivity, which may
have something to do with the universal bound of diffusion. At finite density,
there are two diffusion constants $D_\pm$ describing the coupled diffusion of
charge and energy. By computing $D_\pm$ exactly, we find that in the incoherent
regime ($\beta/T \gg 1,\ \beta/\mu \gg 1$) $D_+$ is identified with the charge
diffusion constant ($D_c$) and $D_-$ is identified with the energy diffusion
constant ($D_e$). In the coherent regime, at very small density, $D_\pm$ are
`maximally' mixed in the sense that $D_+(D_-)$ is identified with $D_e(D_c)$,
which is opposite to the case in the incoherent regime. In the incoherent
regime $D_e \sim C_- \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_- = 1/2$ or 1 so it is
universal independently of $\beta$ and $\mu$. However, $D_c \sim C_+ \hbar
v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_+ = 1$ or $ \beta^2/16\pi^2 T^2$ so, in general, $C_+$
may not saturate to the lower bound in the incoherent regime, which suggests
that the characteristic velocity for charge diffusion may not be the butterfly
velocity. We find that the finite density does not affect the diffusion
property at zero density in the incoherent regime.

this geometry we derive a multi-mode generalized Bose-Hubbard model for
determining the quantum phases of the gas at the mechanical instability taking
into account the quantum fluctuations in all directions of space. Our model
limits the dimension of the numerically relevant Hilbert subspace by means of
an appropriate decomposition of the field operator, which is obtained from a
field theoretical model of the linear-zigzag instability. We determine the
phase diagrams of small systems using exact diagonalization and find that, even
for tight transverse confinement, the aspect ratio between the two transverse
trap frequencies controls not only the classical but also the quantum
properties of the ground state in a non-trivial way. Convergence tests at the

Commun",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In practical massive MIMO systems, a substantial portion of system resources
are consumed to acquire channel state information (CSI), leading to a
drastically lower system capacity compared with the ideal case where perfect
CSI is available. In this paper, we show that the overhead for CSI acquisition
can be largely compensated by the potential gain due to the sparsity of the
massive MIMO channel in a certain transformed domain. To this end, we propose a
novel blind detection scheme that simultaneously estimates the channel and data
by factorizing the received signal matrix. We show that by exploiting the
channel sparsity, our proposed scheme can achieve a DoF very close to the ideal
case, provided that the channel is sufficiently sparse. Specifically, the
achievable degree of freedom (DoF) has a fractional gap of only $1/T$ from the
ideal DoF, where $T$ is the channel coherence time. This is a remarkable
advance for understanding the performance limit of the massive MIMO system. We
further show that the performance advantage of our proposed scheme in the
asymptotic SNR regime carries over to the practical SNR regime. Numerical
results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms its
counterpart schemes in the practical SNR regime under various system
configurations.

Darboux transformation (FDT) algorithm having an operational complexity of
$\mathscr{O}\left(KN+N\log^2N\right)$ such that the error in the computed
$N$-samples of the $K$-soliton vanishes as $\mathscr{O}\left(N^{-p}\right)$

fixed $N$, this algorithm outperforms the the classical DT (CDT) algorithm
which has a complexity of $\mathscr{O}\left(K^2N\right)$. We further present
extension of these algorithms to the general version of DT which allows one to
add solitons to arbitrary profiles that are admissible as scattering potentials
in the ZS-problem. The general CDT/FDT algorithms have the same operational
complexity as that of the $K$-soliton case and the order of convergence matches
that of the underlying one-step method. A comparative study of these algorithms

self-organize into spatial patterns in the underlying metric space. The
resulting metric clusters of cooperators are able to survive in social dilemmas
as their spatial organization shields them from surrounding defectors, similar
to spatial selection in Euclidean space. We show that under certain conditions
these metric clusters are more efficient than the most connected nodes at
sustaining cooperation and that heterogeneity does not always favor--but can
even hinder--cooperation in social dilemmas. Our findings provide a new
perspective to understand the emergence of cooperation in evolutionary games in

Galaxies in BLUETIDES are characterised by rapidly increasing star formation

largely insensitive to stellar mass. As a result of the enhanced surface
density of metals more massive galaxies are predicted to have higher dust
attenuation resulting in a significant steepening of the observed far-UV

the UV luminosities of galaxies with stellar masses $10^{9-10}\,{\rm

discovered in low-capacitance ion channels/nanopores. Depending on the fixed

which a given type of ion can permeate the pore. The phenomenon arises from the
discreteness of the charge-carriers, the dielectric self-energy, an
electrostatic exclusion principle, and sequential pore neutralization, and it
manifests itself strongly for divalent ions (e.g.\ Ca$^{2+}$). Ionic Coulomb
blockade is closely analogous to electronic Coulomb blockade in quantum dots.
In addition to the non-local 1D Coulomb interaction considered in the standard
Coulomb blockade approach, we now propose a correction to take account of the
singular part of the attraction to the binding site (i.e.\ local site binding).
We show that this correction leads to a geometry-dependent shift of one of the

thermoelectric performance of SnSe. In the hole-doped regime, two kinds of
valence band valleys contribute to its transport properties: one is the valley
near the U-Z line, mainly consisting of the Se-$p_z$ orbitals, and the other is
the one along the $\Gamma$-Y line, mainly consisting of the Se-$p_y$ orbitals.
Whereas the former valley plays a major role in determining the transport
properties at room temperature, the latter one also offers comparable
contribution and so the band structure exhibits multi-valley character by
increasing the temperature. In the electron-doped regime, the conduction band
valley around the $\Gamma$ point solely contributes to the thermoelectric
performance, where the quasi-one-dimensional electronic structure along the
$a$-axis is crucial. This study provides an important knowledge for the
thermoelectric properties of SnSe, and will be useful for future search of
high-performance thermoelectric materials.

known example is the Casimir effect [1, 2] that is observed in quantum

finite boundaries have been observed, for example the surface plasmon mode [3]
that appears when the plasma has a finite extension. In this work a novel
instability associated with the finite transverse size of a beam owing through
a plasma system has been shown to exist. This instability leads to distinct
characteristic features of the associated magnetic field that gets generated.
For example, in contrast to the well known unstable Weibel mode of a beam
plasma system which generates magnetic field at the skin depth scale, this
instability generates magnetic field at the scales length of the transverse
beam dimension [4]. The existence of this new instability is demonstrated by
analytical arguments and by simulations conducted with the help of a variety of

interaction among each other and with external fields. They demonstrate
characteristic scaling laws in dependence on the principal quantum number $n$
for features such as the magnetic field for level crossing. While bearing
striking similarities to Rydberg atoms, fundamentally new insights may be
obtained for Rydberg excitons, as the crystal environment gives easy optical
access to many states within an exciton multiplet. Here we study experimentally
and theoretically the scaling of several characteristic parameters of Rydberg
excitons with $n$. From absorption spectra in magnetic field we find for the
first crossing of levels with adjacent principal quantum numbers a $B_r \propto
n^{-4}$ dependence of the resonance field strength, $B_r$, due to the dominant
paramagnetic term unlike in the atomic case where the diamagnetic contribution
is decisive. By contrast, in electric field we find scaling laws just like for
Rydberg atoms. The resonance electric field strength scales as $E_r \propto
n^{-5}$. We observe anticrossings of the states belonging to multiplets with
different principal quantum numbers. The energy splittings at the avoided
crossings scale as $n^{-4}$ which we relate to the crystal specific deviation
of the exciton Hamiltonian from the hydrogen model. We observe the exciton
polarizability in the electric field to scale as $n^7$. In magnetic field the
crossover field strength from a hydrogen-like exciton to a magnetoexciton
dominated by electron and hole Landau level quantization scales as $n^{-3}$.
The ionization voltages demonstrate a $n^{-4}$ scaling as for atoms. The width
of the absorption lines remains constant before dissociation for high enough
$n$, while for small $n \lesssim 12$ an exponential increase with the field is
found. These results are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations.

hydrogen, and in waste water treatment to degrade the organic pollutants. It is
soluble in ethanol, ethylene glycol and chloroform. TiO2 nanopowder is prepared
by many methods such as sol-gel method, chemical vapour deposition,
hydro-thermal, micro-emulsion etc. However, low cost and large scale synthesis
of nanoparticles for commercial applications are the major challenges in the

than other methods. It is a low cost, non toxic method which offers high
chemical stability. The finely grinded TiO2 nano powder offers shiny surface

problems. A large variety of methods has been established in recent years,
ranging from bi-level learning to high-dimensional machine learning techniques.
Most learning approaches, however, only aim at fitting parametrised models to
favourable training data whilst ignoring misfit training data completely. In
this paper, we follow up on the idea of learning parametrised regularisation
functions by quotient minimisation as established in [3]. We extend the model
therein to include higher-dimensional filter functions to be learned and allow
for fit- and misfit-training data consisting of multiple functions. We first
present results resembling behaviour of well-established derivative-based
sparse regularisers like total variation or higher-order total variation in
one-dimension. Our second and main contribution is the introduction of novel
families of non-derivative-based regularisers. This is accomplished by learning
favourable scales and geometric properties while at the same time avoiding
unfavourable ones.

as a result of gluing geometric realizations of its n-simplices followed by
removing the simplices of dimension n-2. The Regge geometry is encoded in a
boundary data of a BF-theory on this manifold. We construct an action
functional which coincides with the standard BF action for suitably regular
manifolds with defects and fields. On the other hand, the action evaluated at
solutions of the field equations satisfying certain boundary conditions
coincides with an evaluation of the Regge action at Regge geometries defined by
the boundary data. As a result we trade the degrees of freedom of Regge

there is a scheduler that always prevents deadline misses (if any), whatever
the sequence of job releases, which is a priori} unknown to the scheduler. In
the multiprocessor setting, this problem is notoriously difficult. The only
exact test for this problem has been proposed by Bonifaci and
Marchetti-Spaccamela: it consists in modelling all the possible behaviours of
the scheduler and of the tasks as a graph; and to interpret this graph as a
game between the tasks and the scheduler, which are seen as antagonistic
players. Then, computing a correct scheduler is equivalent to finding a winning
strategy for the `scheduler player', whose objective in the game is to avoid
deadline misses. In practice, however this approach is limited by the
intractable size of the graph. In this work, we consider the classical
attractor algorithm to solve such games, and introduce antichain techniques to
optimise its performance in practice and overcome the huge size of the game
graph. These techniques are inspired from results from the formal methods
community, and exploit the specific structure of the feasibility problem. We
demonstrate empirically that our approach allows to dramatically improve the
performance of the game solving algorithm.

drive smoothly in most situations, while maintaining their velocity below a
predetermined speed limit. However, some scenarios such as low road adherence
or inadequate speed limit may require vehicles to automatically adapt their
velocity without external input, while nearing the limits of their dynamic
capacities. Many of the existing trajectory planning approaches are incapable
of making such adjustments, since they assume a feasible velocity reference is
given. Moreover, near-limits trajectory planning often implies high-complexity
dynamic vehicle models, making computations difficult. In this article, we use
a simple dynamic model derived from numerical simulations to design a
trajectory planner for high-speed driving of an autonomous vehicle based on
model predictive control. Unlike existing techniques, our formulation includes
the selection of a feasible velocity to track a predetermined path while
avoiding obstacles. Simulation results on a highly precise vehicle model show
that our approach can be used in real-time to provide feasible trajectories
that can be tracked using a simple control architecture. Moreover, the use of
our simplified model makes the planner more robust and yields better
trajectories compared to kinematic models commonly used in trajectory planning.

adds linear combinations of ""shifted"" Green functions, ensuring that the
spatial singularities introduced by these terms are located below the grating
and therefore outside of the physical domain. With suitable coefficient choices
these terms annihilate the growing contributions in the original lattice sum
and yield algebraic convergence. Convergence of arbitrarily high order can be
obtained by including sufficiently many shifts. The second type of added terms
are quasi-periodic plane wave solutions of the Helmholtz equation which
reinstate certain necessary grazing modes without leading to blow-up at Wood

present an efficient high-order numerical method based on the this new Green
function for the problem of scattering by doubly periodic three-dimensional

methods for a class of highly oscillatory transport equations that arise in
semiclassical modeling of non-adiabatic quantum dynamics. These models contain
uncertainties, particularly in coefficients that correspond to the potentials
of the molecular system. We first focus on a highly oscillatory scalar model
with random uncertainty. Our method is built upon the nonlinear geometrical
optics (NGO) based method, developed in \cite{NGO} for numerical approximations
of deterministic equations, which can obtain accurate pointwise solution even
without numerically resolving spatially and temporally the oscillations. With
the random uncertainty, we show that such a method has oscillatory higher order
derivatives in the random space, thus requires a frequency dependent
discretization in the random space. We modify this method by introducing a new
""time"" variable based on the phase, which is shown to be non-oscillatory in the
random space, based on which we develop a gPC-SG method that can capture
oscillations with the frequency-independent time step, mesh size as well as the

radiative corrections to some important observables associated with the
Drell-Yan, scalar and pseudo-scalar Higgs boson productions at
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^{3}$LO) aiming to uplift the accuracy
of theoretical results. The Higgs bosons are produced dominantly at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) via gluon fusion through top quark loop, while one of the
subdominant ones takes place through bottom quark annihilation whose
contribution is equally important and must be included in precision studies.
Here, we have computed analytically the inclusive cross section of the Higgs
boson produced through this channel under the soft-virtual (SV) approximation
at N$^{3}$LO QCD following an elegant formalism. Moreover, the differential
rapidity distribution is another most important observable, which is expected
to be measured in upcoming days at the LHC. This immediately calls for very
precise theoretical predictions. The analytical expressions of the SV
corrections to this observable at N$^{3}$LO for the Higgs boson, produced
through gluon fusion, and leptonic pair in Drell-Yan (DY) production are
computed and the numerical impacts of these results are demonstrated. In
addition, the CP-odd/pseudo-scalar Higgs boson, which is one of the most prime
candidates in BSM scenarios, is studied in great details, taking into account
the QCD radiative corrections. We have computed the analytical results of the
three loop QCD corrections to the pseudo-scalar Higgs boson production and
consequently, obtained the inclusive production cross section at N$^{3}$LO
under SV approximation. These indeed help to reduce the theoretical
uncertainties arising from the renormalisation and factorisation scales and

sensitivity. Given two randomly chosen nodes, the sensitivity means the
probability that the more central node in the observed network is also more
central in the underlying network. The sensitivity concept relies on the
underlying network which is usually not accessible. Therefore, we propose two
methods to approximate the sensitivity. The iterative method, which simulates
possible underlying networks for the estimation and the imputation method,
which uses the sensitivity of the observed network for the estimation. Both
methods rely on the observed network and assumptions about the underlying type
of measurement error (e.g., the percentage of missing edges or nodes).
  Our experiments on real-world networks and random graphs show that the
iterative method performs well in many cases. In contrast, the imputation
method does not yield useful estimations for networks other than
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.

dense 3D reconstruction from multiple depth images. The most common approach to
depth fusion is based on averaging truncated signed distance functions, which
was originally proposed by Curless and Levoy in 1996. While this method is
simple and provides great results, it is not able to reconstruct (partially)
occluded surfaces and requires a large number frames to filter out sensor noise
and outliers. Motivated by the availability of large 3D model repositories and
recent advances in deep learning, we present a novel 3D CNN architecture that
learns to predict an implicit surface representation from the input depth maps.
Our learning based method significantly outperforms the traditional volumetric
fusion approach in terms of noise reduction and outlier suppression. By
learning the structure of real world 3D objects and scenes, our approach is
further able to reconstruct occluded regions and to fill in gaps in the
reconstruction. We demonstrate that our learning based approach outperforms
both vanilla TSDF fusion as well as TV-L1 fusion on the task of volumetric
fusion. Further, we demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D shape completion results.

algebraic relations between multiple inner products coming from the
non-commutative algebra of the angular momenta. A general formalism is derived
giving the integrated solution valid for all values of the involved spins, and
several applications of the formalism are treated in details. Among other
results, it is seen that, starting from a fully polarised state for the set of
identical spins, their total spin can at most only partially flip (in the
mean); this somewhat surprising fact means that the memory of the initial state
is kept for ever but varying the coupling constant allows to adjust at will the
possible polarisation of the final state. The robustness of the initial state
is shown to depend on the nature fermionic or bosonic of the perturbing spin
and also on the size of the collection of identical spins.

the curse of dimensionality and the ill-posedness, pointwise nonparametric

construct tests and confidence statements for qualitative features of the joint

Q-resolution operates on clauses and term-resolution operates on models of the

quiescence. During five of the six quiescent epochs we find evidence for a
second photometric period which is roughly 5 percent shorter than the 4.16 h
orbital period which we attribute to negative superhumps. V729 Sgr is therefore
one of the longest period CVs to show negative superhumps during quiescence.

in the analysis of real-world complex networks, and the problem of selecting
the $k$ most central vertices has been deeply analysed in the last decade.
However, this problem is computationally not easy, especially for large
networks: in the first part of the paper, we prove that it is not solvable in
time $\O(|E|^{2-\epsilon})$ on directed graphs, for any constant $\epsilon>0$,
under reasonable complexity assumptions. Furthermore, we propose a new
algorithm for selecting the $k$ most central nodes in a graph: we
experimentally show that this algorithm improves significantly both the
textbook algorithm, which is based on computing the distance between all pairs
of vertices, and the state of the art. For example, we are able to compute the
top $k$ nodes in few dozens of seconds in real-world networks with millions of
nodes and edges. Finally, as a case study, we compute the $10$ most central

played together in a movie, and in the Wikipedia citation network, which
contains a directed edge from a page $p$ to a page $q$ if $p$ contains a link

few iterations, and the solution sparsity significantly reduces the
computational cost per iteration. Particularly, we demonstrate the superiority
of PSM over various sparse learning approaches, including Dantzig selector for
sparse linear regression, LAD-Lasso for sparse robust linear regression, CLIME
for sparse precision matrix estimation, sparse differential network estimation,
and sparse Linear Programming Discriminant (LPD) analysis. We then provide
sufficient conditions under which PSM always outputs sparse solutions such that
its computational performance can be significantly boosted. Thorough numerical

applications, such as search and rescue in disaster areas or human social
interaction. Inertial-measurement unit (IMU) is promising to determine the
change of position over short periods of time, but it is very sensitive to
error accumulation over long term run. By equipping the mobile users with
ranging unit, e.g. ultra-wideband (UWB), it is possible to achieve accurate
relative positioning by trilateration-based approaches. As compared to vision
or laser-based sensors, the UWB does not need to be with in line-of-sight and
provides accurate distance estimation. However, UWB does not provide any
bearing information and the communication range is limited, thus UWB alone
cannot determine the user location without any ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose an approach to combine IMU inertial and UWB ranging measurement for
relative positioning between multiple mobile users without the knowledge of the
infrastructure. We incorporate the UWB and the IMU measurement into a
probabilistic-based framework, which allows to cooperatively position a group
of mobile users and recover from positioning failures. We have conducted
extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating IMU inertial
and UWB ranging measurements.

it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In
this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the

unitary notion of time is discussed. The subjectivity associated with the

the asymptotic form of the mean squared displacement of the tfLe transits from
$t^2$ (ballistic diffusion for short time) to $t^{2-2H}$, and then to $t^2$
(again ballistic diffusion for long time). On the other hand, the overdamped
tfLe has the transition of the diffusion type from $t^{2-2H}$ to $t^2$
(ballistic diffusion). The tfLe with harmonic potential is also considered.

phase-separated solution is studied. A {\it kinetic} critical radius rather
than the {\it thermodynamic} critical radius of standard classical nucleation
theory can be defined from the diffusional growth equations. It is shown that
there exist two kinetic critical radii for the core-shell-type nucleus, for
which both the inner core radius and the outer shell radius will be stationary.
Therefore, these two critical radii correspond to a single critical point of
the nucleation path with a single energy barrier even though the nucleation
looks like a two-step process. The two radii are given by formulas similar to
that of classical nucleation theory if the Ostwald-Freundlich boundary
condition is imposed at the surface of the inner nucleus and that of the outer
shell. The subsequent growth of a core-shell-type post-critical nucleus follows
the classical picture of Ostwald's step rule. Our result is consistent with
some of the experimental and numerical results which suggest the
core-shell-type critical nucleus.

  mode decomposition","to be published in Neurocomputing",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dictionary learning is a challenge topic in many image processing areas. The
basic goal is to learn a sparse representation from an overcomplete basis set.
Due to combining the advantages of generic multiscale representations with
learning based adaptivity, multiscale dictionary representation approaches have
the power in capturing structural characteristics of natural images. However,
existing multiscale learning approaches still suffer from three main
weaknesses: inadaptability to diverse scales of image data, sensitivity to
noise and outliers, difficulty to determine optimal dictionary structure. In
this paper, we present a novel multiscale dictionary learning paradigm for
sparse image representations based on an improved empirical mode decomposition.
This powerful data-driven analysis tool for multi-dimensional signal can fully
adaptively decompose the image into multiscale oscillating components according
to intrinsic modes of data self. This treatment can obtain a robust and
effective sparse representation, and meanwhile generates a raw base dictionary
at multiple geometric scales and spatial frequency bands. This dictionary is
refined by selecting optimal oscillating atoms based on frequency clustering.
In order to further enhance sparsity and generalization, a tolerance dictionary
is learned using a coherence regularized model. A fast proximal scheme is
developed to optimize this model. The multiscale dictionary is considered as
the product of oscillating dictionary and tolerance dictionary. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed learning approach has the superior
performance in sparse image representations as compared with several competing
methods. We also show the promising results in image denoising application.

transfer. This paper introduces a novel scheme that facilitates energy
beamforming by utilizing Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to
estimate the channel. Firstly, in the training stage, the ET will transmit
using each beamforming vector in a codebook, which is pre-defined using a
Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis. RSSI value corresponding to each beamforming
vector is fed back to the ET, and these values are used to estimate the channel
through a maximum likelihood analysis. The results that are obtained are
remarkably simple, requires minimal processing, and can be easily implemented.
The paper also validates the analytical results numerically, as well as
experimentally, and it is shown that the proposed method achieves impressive
results.
