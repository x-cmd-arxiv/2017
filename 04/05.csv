evolution and changes in the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum.
Four antineutrino detectors in two experimental halls were used to identify 2.2
million inverse beta decays (IBDs) over 1230 days spanning multiple fuel cycles
for each of six 2.9 GW$_{\textrm{th}}$ reactor cores at the Daya Bay and Ling
Ao nuclear power plants. Using detector data spanning effective $^{239}$Pu
fission fractions, $F_{239}$, from 0.25 to 0.35, Daya Bay measures an average
IBD yield, $\bar{\sigma}_f$, of $(5.90 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-43}$
cm$^2$/fission and a fuel-dependent variation in the IBD yield,
$d\sigma_f/dF_{239}$, of $(-1.86 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$/fission.
This observation rejects the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino flux as a
function of the $^{239}$Pu fission fraction at 10 standard deviations. The
variation in IBD yield was found to be energy-dependent, rejecting the
hypothesis of a constant antineutrino energy spectrum at 5.1 standard
deviations. While measurements of the evolution in the IBD spectrum show
general agreement with predictions from recent reactor models, the measured
evolution in total IBD yield disagrees with recent predictions at 3.1$\sigma$.
This discrepancy indicates that an overall deficit in measured flux with
respect to predictions does not result from equal fractional deficits from the
primary fission isotopes $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, $^{238}$U, and $^{241}$Pu.
Based on measured IBD yield variations, yields of $(6.17 \pm 0.17)$ and $(4.27
\pm 0.26) \times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$/fission have been determined for the two
dominant fission parent isotopes $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu. A 7.8% discrepancy
between the observed and predicted $^{235}$U yield suggests that this isotope
may be the primary contributor to the reactor antineutrino anomaly.

computer vision. Most approaches recover the depth at each pixel based on the
focal setting which exhibits maximal sharpness. Yet, it is not obvious how to
reliably estimate the sharpness level, particularly in low-textured areas. In
this paper, we propose `Deep Depth From Focus (DDFF)' as the first end-to-end
learning approach to this problem. One of the main challenges we face is the
hunger for data of deep neural networks. In order to obtain a significant
amount of focal stacks with corresponding groundtruth depth, we propose to
leverage a light-field camera with a co-calibrated RGB-D sensor. This allows us
to digitally create focal stacks of varying sizes. Compared to existing
benchmarks our dataset is 25 times larger, enabling the use of machine learning
for this inverse problem. We compare our results with state-of-the-art DFF
methods and we also analyze the effect of several key deep architectural
components. These experiments show that our proposed method `DDFFNet' achieves
state-of-the-art performance in all scenes, reducing depth error by more than
75% compared to the classical DFF methods.

Without substantial domain knowledge, multivariate search queries often return
sparse or uninformative results. This paper introduces an approach for
searching structured data based on probabilistic programming and nonparametric
Bayes. Users specify queries in a probabilistic language that combines standard
SQL database search operators with an information theoretic ranking function
called predictive relevance. Predictive relevance can be calculated by a fast
sparse matrix algorithm based on posterior samples from CrossCat, a
nonparametric Bayesian model for high-dimensional, heterogeneously-typed data
tables. The result is a flexible search technique that applies to a broad class
of information retrieval problems, which we integrate into BayesDB, a
probabilistic programming platform for probabilistic data analysis. This paper
demonstrates applications to databases of US colleges, global macroeconomic
indicators of public health, and classic cars. We found that human evaluators
often prefer the results from probabilistic search to results from a standard

growing. Many researchers nowadays, conduct and validate their solutions using
empirical research. Survey is one empirical method which enables researchers to
collect data from a large population. Main aim of the survey is to generalize
the findings. Aims: In this study we aim to identify the problems researchers
face during survey design, and mitigation strategies. Method: A literature
review as well as semi-structured interviews with nine software engineering
researchers were conducted to elicit their views on problems and mitigation
strategies. The researchers are all focused on empirical software engineering.
Results: We identified 24 problems and 65 strategies, structured according to
the survey research process. The most commonly discussed problem was sampling,
in particular the ability to obtain a sufficiently large sample. To improve
survey instrument design, evaluation and execution recommendations for question
formulation and survey pre-testing were given. The importance of involving
multiple researchers in the analysis of survey results was stressed.
Conclusions: The elicited problems and strategies may serve researchers during
the design of their studies. However, it was observed that some strategies were
conflicting. This shows that it is important to conduct a trade-off analysis
between strategies.

statistics, as the measured degree of second order coherence,

Halpha line, a common accretion tracer for young stars, to determine whether
they host a passive circumstellar disk. We used medium-resolution optical
spectroscopy to assess the objects' accretion status and to measure the Halpha
line. We found no convincing example of passive disks; only transition disk and
debris disk systems in our sample are non-accreting. Among accretors, we find
no example of flickering accretion, leading to an upper limit of 2.2% on the
duty cycle of accretion gaps assuming that all accreting TTS experience such
events. Combining literature results with our observations, we find that the
reliability of traditional Halpha-based criteria to test for accretion is high
but imperfect, particularly for low-mass TTS. We find a significant correlation
between stellar mass and the full width at 10 per cent of the peak (W10%) of
the Halpha line that does not seem to be related to variations in free-fall
velocity. Finally, our data reveal a positive correlation between the Halpha
equivalent width and its W10%, indicative of a systematic modulation in the
line profile whereby the high-velocity wings of the line are proportionally
more enhanced than its core when the line luminosity increases. We argue that
this supports the hypothesis that the mass accretion rate on the central star
is correlated with the Halpha W10% through a common physical mechanism.

$S$ with $K^2_S = 40, p_g=4, q=0$ whose canonical map has always degree $\geq
2$, and, for the general surface, of degree $2$ onto a canonical surface $Y$
with $K^2_Y = 12, p_g=4, q=0$.

of curves $(C_1 \times C_2 )/ G$; in our examples the group $G$ is elementary

enhanced, engineered, and efficiently extracted to the far-field for
observation. With this technique, the plasmonic thermal near-field of a 10nm

observed without the introduction of a vacuum-gap, a feature unique to this

terms of a 2-spinor bundle as the basic `building block'. This allows a clear,
direct view of geometric constructions aimed at a theory of such fields on a
curved spacetime. In particular, one recovers the Bargmann-Wigner equations and
the $2(2j+1)$-dimensional representation of the angular-momentum algebra needed
for the Joos-Weinberg equations. Looking for a first-order Lagrangian field
theory we argue, through considerations related to the 2-spinor description of
the Dirac map, that the needed bundle must be a fibered direct sum of a
symmetric `main sector'--carrying an irreducible representation of the
angular--momentum algebra|and an induced sequence of `ghost sectors'. Then one
indeed gets a Lagrangian field theory that, at least formally, can be expressed
in a way similar to the Dirac theory. In flat spacetime one gets plane-wave
solutions that are characterised by their values in the main sector. Besides
symmetric spinors, the above procedures can be adapted to anti-symmetric
spinors and to Hermitian spinors (the latter describing integer-spin fields).
Through natural decompositions, the case of a spin-2 field describing a
possible deformation of the spacetime metric can be treated in terms of the
previous results.

to demonstrate the collinear order for the iron deficient side of the Fe1+xTe

fluctuations associated with this collinear order are predominately transverse
at low energy transfers, consistent with a localized magnetic moment picture.
We then apply neutron inelastic scattering and polarization analysis to
investigate the dynamics and structure near the boundary between collinear and
helical order in the Fe1+xTe phase diagram. We first show that the phase
separating collinear and helical order is characterized by a spin-density wave
with a single propagation wave vector of (~ 0.45, 0, 0.5). We do not observe
harmonics or the presence of a charge density wave. The magnetic fluctuations
associated with this wavevector are different from the collinear phase being
strongly longitudinal in nature and correlated anisotropically in the (H,K)
plane. The excitations preserve the C4 symmetry of the lattice, but display
different widths in momentum along the two tetragonal directions at low energy
transfers. While the low energy excitations and minimal magnetic phase diagram
can be understood in terms of localized interactions, we suggest that the

transforming in the bi-fundamental representation $(N,\bar N)$ preserves, for
$N>4$, an accidental $U(1)$ symmetry firstly broken at operator dimension $N$.
Two configurations are possible for the vacuum expectation value of $Y$, which
correspond to the (maximal) little groups $\mathcal{H}_s=SU(N)_{L+R}$ and
$\mathcal{H}_h=SU(N-1)_L\times SU(N-1)_R\times U(1)_{L+R}$. In the first case
the accidental $U(1)$ gets also broken, yielding a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson
with mass suppression controlled by $N$, while in the second case a global
$U(1)$ remains unbroken. The strong CP problem is solved by coupling $Y$ to new
fermions carrying color. The first case allows for a Peccei-Quinn solution with
$U(1)_{PQ}$ protected up to order $N$ by the gauge symmetry. In the second case
$U(1)$ can get broken by condensates of the new strong dynamics, resulting in a
composite axion. By coupling $Y$ to fermions carrying only weak isospin, models
for axion-like particles can be constructed.

Ly$\alpha$ emitters, UV selected star forming (SF) galaxies and quasars at
similar redshifts. The CII] LF at $z\sim0.68$ is equally well described by a
Schechter or a power-law LF, characteristic of a mixture of SF and AGN
activity. The CIII] LF ($z\sim1.05$) is consistent to a scaled down version of
the Schechter H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ LF at their redshift, indicating a SF
origin. In stark contrast, the CIV LF at $z\sim1.53$ is well fit by a
power-law, quasar-like LF. We find that the brightest UV sources ($M_{UV}<-22$)
will universally have CIII] and CIV emission. However, on average, CIII] and
CIV are not as abundant as H$\alpha$ or Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the same
redshift, with cosmic average ratios of $\sim0.02-0.06$ to H$\alpha$ and
$\sim0.01-0.1$ to intrinsic Ly$\alpha$. We predict that the CIII] and CIV lines
can only be truly competitive in confirming high redshift candidates when the
hosts are intrinsically bright and the effective Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction is
below 1 per cent. While CIII] and CIV were proposed as good tracers of young,
relatively low-metallicity galaxies typical of the early Universe, we find

atmospheric model we employ makes the problem analytically tractable and
permits the derivation of useful scaling relations. We show that many tidal
models provide thermal feedback, producing interior radiative zones and leading
to enhanced g-mode dissipation with a wide spectrum of resonances. These
resonances are dynamically tuned by the thermal feedback, and so represent a
novel form of thermomechanical feedback, coupling vibrational modes to the very
slow thermal evolution of the planet. We then show that stellar irradiation
allows the heat produced by these modes to be trapped at depth with high
efficiency, leading to entropy increase in the central convective region, as
well as expansion of the planet's radius sufficient to match observed swelling.
We find that thermally driven winds play an essential role in this process by
making the thermal structure of the atmosphere spherically symmetric within a
few scale heights of the photosphere. We characterise the relationship between
the swelling factor, the orbital period and the host star and determine the
timescale for swelling. We show that these g-modes suffice to produce bloating

the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees
with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red
sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*>10^10.5 Mo.
The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass
via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold
inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red
sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming
galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We
then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite

show good agreement with observations out to z~2, despite not including a rapid
early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched
galaxies are far too numerous at z<1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly
over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise
a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and
keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench

Previous efforts propose specialized hardware implementations for DNNs,

the inputs to DNNs to improve their compute efficiency with comparable
classification accuracy. DyVEDeep equips DNNs with dynamic effort mechanisms
that, in the course of processing an input, identify how critical a group of
computations are to classify the input. DyVEDeep dynamically focuses its
compute effort only on the critical computa- tions, while skipping or
approximating the rest. We propose 3 effort knobs that operate at different
levels of granularity viz. neuron, feature and layer levels. We build DyVEDeep
versions for 5 popular image recognition benchmarks - one for CIFAR-10 and four

homogeneous because most of the key seismic parameters can be explained using a
simplified mineralogical model at expected press-temperature conditions.
However, recent high-resolution tomographic images have revealed seismic and
chemical stratification in the middle-to-lower parts of the lower mantle. Thus
far, the mechanism for the compositional stratification and seismic
inhomogeneity, especially their relationship with the speciation of iron in the
lower mantle, remains poorly understood. We have built a complete and
integrated thermodynamic model of iron and aluminum chemistry for lower mantle
conditions, and from this model has emerged a stratified picture of the
valence, spin and composition profile in the lower mantle. Within this picture
the lower mantle has an upper region with Fe3+ enriched bridgmanite with
high-spin ferropericlase and metallic Fe, and a lower region with low-spin,
iron-enriched ferropericlase coexisting with iron-depleted bridgmanite and
almost no metallic Fe. The transition between the regions occurs at a depth of
around 1600km and is driven by the spin transition in ferropericlase, which
significantly changes the iron partitioning and speciation to one that favors
Fe2+ in ferropericlase and suppresses Fe3+ and metallic iron formation These
changes lead to lowered bulk sound velocity by 3-4% around the mid-lower mantle
and enhanced density by ~1% toward the lowermost mantle. The predicted
chemically and seismically stratified lower mantle differs dramatically from
the traditional homogeneous model.

important to constrain their physical parameters and internal angular momentum
distribution to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar
internal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally
split oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars
more massive than the Sun. The SPB star HD201433 is known to be part of a
single-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting
with periods of about 3.3 and 154 d. Our results are based on photometric
observations made by BRITE - Constellation and the SMEI on board the Coriolis
satellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 years of radial
velocity measurements. We identify a sequence of 9 rotationally split dipole
modes in the photometric time series and establish that HD201433 is in
principle a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297+/-76 d.
Tidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly
accelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one
hundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of HD201433 is also
reflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of
about 0.9 s during the last 96 years. Combining the asteroseismic inferences
with the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner
binary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central SPB star
and its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit but not yet aligned
all spins of the system and have just begun to synchronise rotation.

incompatible with one another, these define distinct contexts for the given
measurement. The Kochen-Specker theorem rules out models of quantum theory that
satisfy a particular assumption of context-independence: that sharp
measurements are assigned outcomes both deterministically and independently of
their context. This notion of noncontextuality is not suited to a direct
experimental test because realistic measurements always have some degree of
unsharpness due to noise. However, a generalized notion of noncontextuality has
been proposed that is applicable to any experimental procedure, including
unsharp measurements, but also preparations as well, and for which a quantum
no-go result still holds. According to this notion, the model need only specify
a probability distribution over the outcomes of a measurement in a
context-independent way, rather than specifying a particular outcome. It also
implies novel constraints of context-independence for the representation of
preparations. In this article, we describe a general technique for translating
proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem into inequality constraints on realistic
experimental statistics, the violation of which witnesses the impossibility of
a noncontextual model. We focus on algebraic state-independent proofs, using
the Peres-Mermin square as our illustrative example. Our technique yields the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a particular set of correlations
(between the preparations and the measurements) to admit a noncontextual model.
The inequalities thus derived are demonstrably robust to noise. We specify how
experimental data must be processed in order to achieve a test of these
inequalities. We also provide a criticism of prior proposals for experimental
tests of noncontextuality based on the Peres-Mermin square.

Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused on
refining the DNN models, but have either shown limited success or required

Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by
coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the
original space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on
the original input with that on squeezed inputs, feature squeezing detects
adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper
explores two feature squeezing methods: reducing the color bit depth of each
pixel and spatial smoothing. These simple strategies are inexpensive and
complementary to other defenses, and can be combined in a joint detection
framework to achieve high detection rates against state-of-the-art attacks.

Fields Legacy Survey for three cluster fields, MACS J0416.1--2403, MACS
J0717.5+3745, and MACS J1149.5+2223. Within the HST coverage, 14 out of 44 850
$\mu$m sources have 3 GHz counterparts, five of which are also detected at 6
GHz. The 850 $\mu$m flux densities of these detected sources span from 0.7 to
4.4 mJy after correcting for lensing amplification. The median redshift of the
sample is $z = 1.28^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$, much lower than the typical redshifts ($z
= 2-3$) of brighter submillimeter galaxies in the literature. In addition, we
find that our sources have lower dust temperatures than those of the brighter
submillimeter galaxies. This is also confirmed by an analysis of the ratio
between infrared star formation rate and 850 $\mu$m flux density. However,
these 14 sources may not represent the general submillimeter population at the
same flux range, given that the SCUBA-2 sources without radio counterparts are
likely at higher redshifts. Detection of these sources would require deeper
radio images or submillimeter interferometry.

non-hyperbolic, some of these admit local bifurcations as well. Consequently
when these equilibrium points are perturbed, they lose their stability giving
rise to quasiperiodic orbits. The numerical simulations carried out by

galaxy clusters in the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph

14.2<log(M_200/M_odot)<15.2 and we measure spatially-resolved stellar
kinematics for 315 member galaxies with stellar masses
10.0<log(M_*/M_odot)<11.7 within 1R_200 of the cluster centers. We calculate
the spin parameter, lambda_R and use that to classify the kinematic morphology
of the galaxies as fast or slow rotators. The total fraction of slow rotators
in the early-type galaxy population, F_SR=0.14+/-0.02 and does not depend on
host cluster mass. Across the eight clusters, the fraction of slow rotators
increases with increasing local overdensity. We also find that the slow-rotator
fraction increases at small clustercentric radii (R_cl<0.3R_200), and note that
there is also an increase in slow-rotator fraction at R_cl~0.6R_200. The slow
rotators at these larger radii reside in cluster substructure. We find the
strongest increase in slow-rotator fraction occurs with increasing stellar
mass. After accounting for the strong correlation with stellar mass, we find no
significant relationship between spin parameter and local overdensity in the
cluster environment. We conclude that the primary driver for the kinematic
morphology--density relationship in galaxy clusters is the changing
distribution of galaxy stellar mass with local environment. The presence of
slow rotators in substructure suggests that the cluster kinematic
morphology--density relationship is a result of mass segregation of
slow-rotating galaxies forming in groups that later merge with clusters and
sink to the cluster center via dynamical friction.

models wrong? Did we misinterpret the probabilities? -- and how they went right
-- Perhaps the analyses were correct even though the predictions were wrong,
that's just the nature of probabilistic forecasting. With this in mind, we
analyze the election outcome with respect to a core set of effectiveness

or wrong, we argue that they were ineffective in conveying the extent to which
the data was informative of the outcome and the level of uncertainty in making
these assessments. Among other things, our analysis sheds light on the
shortcomings of the classical interpretations of probability and its
communication to consumers in the form of predictions. We present here an
alternative approach, based on a notion of validity, which offers two immediate
insights for predictive inference. First, the predictions are more
conservative, arguably more realistic, and come with certain guarantees on the
probability of an erroneous prediction. Second, our approach easily and
naturally reflects the (possibly substantial) uncertainty about the model by
outputting plausibilities instead of probabilities. Had these simple steps been
taken by the popular prediction outlets, the election outcome may not have been
so shocking.

optimisation model to find an optimal allocation for the combination of both
assets and currency hedging positions. Our optimisation model allows a
""currency overlay"", or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to
provide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency
exposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are
also included.
  To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return
distributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine
copula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of
the characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and
asymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the
uncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio
optimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated
from the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a
standard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the
proposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios
that give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario
generation approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return
compensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher
returns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the non-normality in
uncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.

The logarithmic entropy growth is understood from a noninteracting chain model

entropy, corresponding respectively to an overlapping and gapped energy spectra

simulations illustrate a new direct laser acceleration scenario, in which the
self-filamentation is triggered in a large-scale near-critical-density plasma
and electron bunches are accelerated periodically and collimated by the
ultra-intense electromagnetic field. The energy density of such electron beams
in high-Z materials reaches to $\sim10^{12} \mathrm{J/m^{3}}$, making it a
promising tool to drive warm or even hot dense matter states.

to prove well-posedness in low regularity Sobolev spaces. By well-posedness in
low regularity Sobolev spaces we mean that less regularity than the one imposed
by the energy methods is required (the energy methods do not exploit the
dispersive properties of the linear part of the equation). In many cases these
methods to prove well-posedness in low regularity Sobolev spaces lead to
optimal results in terms of the regularity of the initial data. By optimal we
mean that if one requires slightly less regularity then the corresponding
Cauchy problem becomes ill-posed in the Hadamard sense. We call the Sobolev
spaces in which these ill-posedness results hold spaces of supercritical
regularity.
  More recently, methods to prove probabilistic well-posedness in Sobolev
spaces of supercritical regularity were developed. More precisely, by
probabilistic well-posedness we mean that one endows the corresponding Sobolev
space of supercritical regularity with a non degenerate probability measure and
then one shows that almost surely with respect to this measure one can define a
(unique) global flow. However, in most of the cases when the methods to prove
probabilistic well-posedness apply, there is no information about the measure
transported by the flow. Very recently, a method to prove that the transported
measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the initial measure was
developed. In such a situation, we have a measure which is quasi-invariant
under the corresponding flow.

deep fusion framework that more effectively exploits spatial features from CNNs

the fully connected features effectively act as an attention mechanism to
direct the LSTM to interesting parts of the convolutional feature sequence. The
significance of our fusion method is its simplicity and effectiveness compared

market. Recent research has shown ways in which a data aggregator can design
mechanisms for users to ensure the quality of data, even in situations where
the users are effort-averse (i.e. prefer to submit lower-quality estimates) and
the data aggregator cannot observe the effort exerted by the users (i.e. the
contract suffers from the principal-agent problem). However, we have shown that
these mechanisms often break down in more realistic models, where multiple data
aggregators are in competition. Under minor assumptions on the properties of
the statistical estimators in use by data aggregators, we show that there is
either no Nash equilibrium, or there is an infinite number of Nash equilibrium.
In the latter case, there is a fundamental ambiguity in who bears the burden of
incentivizing different data sources. We are also able to calculate the price
of anarchy, which measures how much social welfare is lost between the Nash
equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e. between non-cooperative strategic play

predictions with accurate laboratory measurements for various types of well
characterized grains, including purely dielectric and strongly absorbing
materials representative of astronomical icy and metallic grains, respectively,
finding excellent agreement without the need of adding free parameters. We use
our model to explore the behavior of an astrophysical cloud illuminated by a
diffuse source with dust grains having parameters typical of the classic ISM
grains of Draine & Lee (1984) and protoplanetary disks, with an application to
the dark silhouette disk 114-426 in Orion Nebula. We find that the scattering
term modifies the transmitted radiation, both in terms of intensity
(extinction) and shape (reddening) of the spectral distribution. In particular,
for small optical thickness our results show that scattering makes reddening
almost negligible at visible wavelengths. Once the optical thickness increases
enough and the probability of scattering events become close to or larger than
1, reddening becomes present but appreciably modified with respect to the
standard expression for line-of-sight absorption. Moreover, variations of the
grain refractive index, in particular the amount of absorption, also play an
important role changing the shape of the spectral transmission curve, with
dielectric grain showing the minimum amount of reddening.

transport properties at the (111) LAO/STO interface. In addition, we find that
the (111) interface samples ""remember"" the backgate voltage $V_F$ at which they
are cooled at temperatures near the superconducting transition temperature
$T_c$, even if $V_g$ is subsequently changed at lower temperatures. The low
energy scale and other characteristics of this memory effect ($<1$ K)
distinguish it from charge-trapping effects previously observed in (001)

  to score network alignments",,,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gene Ontology (GO) terms are frequently used to score alignments between
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Methods exist to measure the GO
similarity between two proteins in isolation, but pairs of proteins in a
network alignment are not isolated: each pairing is implicitly dependent upon
every other pairing via the alignment itself. Current methods fail to take into
account the frequency of GO terms across the networks, and attempt to account
for common GO terms in an ad hoc fashion by imposing arbitrary rules on when to
""allow"" GO terms based on their location in the GO hierarchy, rather than using
readily available frequency information in the PPI networks themselves. Here we
develop a new measure, NetGO, that naturally weighs infrequent, informative GO
terms more heavily than frequent, less informative GO terms, without requiring
arbitrary cutoffs. In particular, NetGO down-weights the score of frequent GO
terms according to their frequency in the networks being aligned. This is a
global measure applicable only to alignments, independent of pairwise GO
measures, in the same sense that the edge-based EC or S3 scores are global
measures of topological similarity independent of pairwise topological
similarities. We demonstrate the superiority of NetGO by creating alignments of
predetermined quality based on homologous pairs of nodes and show that NetGO
correlates with alignment quality much better than any existing GO-based
alignment measures. We also demonstrate that NetGO provides a measure of
taxonomic similarity between species, consistent with existing taxonomic
measures--a feature not shared with existing GO-based network alignment
measures. Finally, we re-score alignments produced by almost a dozen aligners
from a previous study and show that NetGO does a better job than existing
measures at separating good alignments from bad ones.

mesons. Specifically, the $q\bar q$ quark model has difficulties in
understanding the light scalar mesons below 1 GeV, scalar and axial-vector
charmed mesons and $1^+$ charmonium-like state $X(3872)$. A common wisdom for
the resolution of these difficulties lies on the coupled channel effects which
will distort the quark model calculations. In this work, we focus on the near
mass degeneracy of scalar charmed mesons, $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$, and its
implications. Within the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory,
we show that near degeneracy can be qualitatively understood as a consequence
of self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels. Quantitatively, the
closeness of $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$ masses can be implemented by adjusting
two relevant strong couplings and the renormalization scale appearing in the
loop diagram. Then this in turn implies the mass similarity of $B_{s0}^*$ and
$B_0^{*0}$ mesons. The $P_0^* P'_1$ interaction with the Goldstone boson is
crucial for understanding the phenomenon of near degeneracy. Based on heavy
quark symmetry in conjunction with corrections from QCD and $1/m_Q$ effects, we
obtain the masses of $B^*_{(s)0}$ and $B'_{(s)1}$ mesons, for example,
$M_{B_{s0}^*}= (5715\pm1)\,{\rm MeV}+\delta\Delta_S$,
$M_{B'_{s1}}=(5763\pm1)\,{\rm MeV}+\delta\Delta_S$ with $\delta\Delta_S$ being
$1/m_Q$ corrections. We find that the predicted mass difference of 48 MeV
between $B'_{s1}$ and $B_{s0}^*$ is larger than that of $20\sim 30$ MeV
inferred from the relativistic quark models, whereas the difference of 15 MeV
between the central values of $M_{B'_{s1}}$ and $M_{B'_1}$ is much smaller than
the quark model expectation of $60-100$ MeV.

Instead, we extend homogeneous graphlets to their heterogeneous counterparts,

applications in estimation, clustering, and video compression. In contrast to
traditional signal processing, the irregularity of the signal domain makes
selecting a sampling set non-trivial and hard to analyze. Indeed, though
conditions for graph signal interpolation from noiseless samples exist, they do
not lead to a unique sampling set. The presence of noise makes choosing among
these sampling sets a hard combinatorial problem. Although greedy sampling
schemes are commonly used in practice, they have no performance guarantee. This
work takes a twofold approach to address this issue. First, universal
performance bounds are derived for the Bayesian estimation of graph signals
from noisy samples. In contrast to currently available bounds, they are not
restricted to specific sampling schemes and hold for any sampling sets. Second,
this paper provides near-optimal guarantees for greedy sampling by introducing
the concept of approximate submodularity and updating the classical greedy
bound. It then provides explicit bounds on the approximate supermodularity of
the interpolation mean-square error showing that it can be optimized with
worst-case guarantees using greedy search even though it is not supermodular.
Simulations illustrate the derived bound for different graph models and show an
application of graph signal sampling to reduce the complexity of kernel
principal component analysis.

events if either one does not cause the other. Its intuitive idea is that the

correlation disappears in both of the resulting subensembles if there is no
causal connection between these correlated events. These subensembles can be
regarded as common causes. Hofer-Szab\'{o} and R\'{e}dei (2004) generalized a
Reichenbachian common cause, and called it a Reichenbachian common cause

ensemble is divided more than two, while it is divided into two parts in the
case of Reichenbachian common causes. The number of these subensembles is
called the size of this system. In the present paper, we examine Reichenbachian
common cause systems in general probability theories which include classical
probability theories and quantum probability theories. It is shown that there
is no Reichenbachian common cause system for any correlation between two events
which are not logical independent, and that a general probability theory which
is represented by an atomless orthomodular lattice with a faithful
$\sigma$-additive probability measure contains Reichenbachian common cause
systems of size 3 for any correlation between two compatible and logical
independent events. Moreover, we discuss a relation between Bell's inequality

the nearest galaxy cluster to us, mapping its X-ray properties along four long
`arms' extending beyond the virial radius. The entropy profiles along all four
azimuths increase with radius, then level out beyond $0.5r_{200}$, while the
average pressure at large radii exceeds Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements.
These results can be explained by enhanced gas density fluctuations (clumping)
in the cluster's outskirts. Using a standard Navarro, Frenk and White (1997)
model, we estimate a virial mass, radius, and concentration parameter of
$M_{200}=1.05\pm0.02\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$, $r_{200}=974.1\pm5.7$ kpc, and $c
= 8.8 \pm0.2$, respectively. The inferred cumulative baryon fraction exceeds
the cosmic mean at $r\sim r_{200}$ along the major axis, suggesting enhanced
gas clumping possibly sourced by a candidate large-scale structure filament
along the north-south direction. The Suzaku data reveal a large-scale sloshing
pattern, with two new cold fronts detected at radii of 233 kpc and 280 kpc
along the western and southern arms, respectively. Two high-temperature regions
are also identified 1 Mpc towards the south and 605 kpc towards the west of
M87, likely representing shocks associated with the ongoing cluster growth.
Although systematic uncertainties in measuring the metallicity for low
temperature plasma remain, the data at large radii appear consistent with a
uniform metal distribution on scales of $\sim 90\times180$ kpc and larger,
providing additional support for the early chemical enrichment scenario driven
by galactic winds at redshifts of 2-3.

$\textit{type defect}$ of $\Delta$. Except when $\Delta$ is of a single
simplex, the type defect of $\Delta$, $\textrm{td}(\Delta)$, is the difference
$ \dim_k \textrm{Tor}_c^S(S/ I_\Delta,k) - c$, where $c$ is the codimension of
$\Delta$ and $S = k[x_1, \ldots x_n]$. We show that this invariant admits
surprisingly nice properties. For example, it is well-behaved when one glues
two complexes together along a face. Furthermore, $\Delta$ is Cohen-Macaulay if
$\textrm{td}(\Delta) \leq 0$. On the other hand, if $\Delta$ is a simple graph
(viewed as a one-dimensional complex), then $\textrm{td}(\Delta') \geq 0$ for
every induced subgraph $\Delta'$ of $\Delta$ if and only if $\Delta$ is
chordal. Requiring connected induced subgraphs to have type defect zero allows
us to define a class of graphs that we call $\textit{treeish}$, and which we
generalize to simplicial complexes. We then extend some of our chordality
results to higher dimensions, proving sharp lower bounds for most Betti numbers
of ideals with linear resolution, and classifying when equalities occur. As an
application, we prove sharp lower bounds for Betti numbers of graded ideals
(not necessarily monomial) with linear resolution.

the possibility of deploying small cells served by base stations mounted on

operators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand
without having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is
attached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to
dynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for
reducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal
blocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we
first propose distributed algorithms for autonomous control of drone movements,
and then model and analyse the spectral efficiency performance of a drone small
cell to shed new light on the fundamental benefits of dynamic repositioning. We
show that, with dynamic repositioning, the spectral efficiency of drone small
cells can be increased by nearly 100\% for realistic drone speed, height, and

noninvasively probing the microstructure of the neuronal tissue. The NODDI
model has been a popular approach to the estimation of tissue microstructure in
many neuroscience studies. It represents the diffusion signals with three types
of diffusion in tissue: intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and cerebrospinal fluid
compartments. However, the original NODDI method uses a computationally
expensive procedure to fit the model and could require a large number of
diffusion gradients for accurate microstructure estimation, which may be
impractical for clinical use. Therefore, efforts have been devoted to efficient
and accurate NODDI microstructure estimation with a reduced number of diffusion
gradients. In this work, we propose a deep network based approach to the NODDI
microstructure estimation, which is named Microstructure Estimation using a
Deep Network (MEDN). Motivated by the AMICO algorithm which accelerates the
computation of NODDI parameters, we formulate the microstructure estimation
problem in a dictionary-based framework. The proposed network comprises two
cascaded stages. The first stage resembles the solution to a dictionary-based
sparse reconstruction problem and the second stage computes the final
microstructure using the output of the first stage. The weights in the two
stages are jointly learned from training data, which is obtained from training
dMRI scans with diffusion gradients that densely sample the q-space. The
proposed method was applied to brain dMRI scans, where two shells each with 30
gradient directions (60 diffusion gradients in total) were used. Estimation
accuracy with respect to the gold standard was measured and the results
demonstrate that MEDN outperforms the competing algorithms.

Existing state-of-art methods formulate this as a binary classification task

Furthermore, in such applications, it may be possible that all images belong to

more appropriate. To this end, we formulate a novel problem of ranking images
with respect to their aesthetic quality. We construct a new dataset of image

they want them to be visually-attractive. This has given rise to automated,
one-touch enhancement tools. However, the inability of those tools to provide

methods to do the same. The existing typical machine-learned methods
heuristically (e.g. kNN-search) predict the enhancement parameters for a new

heuristic methods need constant interaction with the training images which
makes the parameter prediction sub-optimal and computationally expensive at

predicting the enhancement parameters given a new image using only its
features, without using any training images. We propose to model the
interaction between the image features and its corresponding enhancement

way to integrate the image features in the MF formulation. We show that our

(DR), a vision-threatening complication. Early detection and timely treatment
can reduce the occurrence of blindness due to DR. Computer-aided diagnosis has
the potential benefit of improving the accuracy and speed in DR detection. This
study is concerned with automatic classification of images with microaneurysm
(MA) and neovascularization (NV), two important DR clinical findings. Together
with normal images, this presents a 3-class classification problem. We propose
a modified color auto-correlogram feature (AutoCC) with low dimensionality that
is spectrally tuned towards DR images. Recognizing the fact that the images
with or without MA or NV are generally different only in small, localized
regions, we propose to employ a multi-class, multiple-instance learning
framework for performing the classification task using the proposed feature.
Extensive experiments including comparison with a few state-of-art image
classification approaches have been performed and the results suggest that the
proposed approach is promising as it outperforms other methods by a large
margin.

minimizing a general convex loss function $f(X)$ regularized by the matrix
nuclear norm $\|X\|_*$. Nuclear-norm regularized matrix inverse problems are at
the heart of many applications in machine learning, signal processing, and
control. The statistical performance of nuclear norm regularization has been
studied extensively in literature using convex analysis techniques. Despite its
optimal performance, the resulting optimization has high computational
complexity when solved using standard or even tailored fast convex solvers. To
develop faster and more scalable algorithms, we follow the proposal of
Burer-Monteiro to factor the matrix variable $X$ into the product of two
smaller rectangular matrices $X=UV^T$ and also replace the nuclear norm
$\|X\|_*$ with $(\|U\|_F^2+\|V\|_F^2)/2$. In spite of the nonconvexity of the
factored formulation, we prove that when the convex loss function $f(X)$ is
$(2r,4r)$-restricted well-conditioned, each critical point of the factored
problem either corresponds to the optimal solution $X^\star$ of the original
convex optimization or is a strict saddle point where the Hessian matrix has a
strictly negative eigenvalue. Such a geometric structure of the factored
formulation allows many local search algorithms to converge to the global
optimum with random initializations.

adaptation of step timing is often neglected as it gives rise to non-convex

is not necessary to optimize walking over several steps to ensure gait
viability and show that it is sufficient to merely select the next step timing

generator with an inverse dynamics controller that does not explicitly control
the center of mass nor the foot center of pressure. This is particularly useful
for biped robots with limited control authority over their foot center of
pressure, such as robots with point feet or passive ankles. Extensive
simulations on a humanoid robot with passive ankles demonstrate the

$\tau_c<10^{6.5}$~yr and located within 4.5~kpc of the Sun, omitting those
within the local spiral arm and those significantly affected by the Galactic
warp, and solve for $z_\odot$ and the scale height, $H$, for different cutoffs
in $\tau_c$. We compute these quantities using just the independently
determined distances, and these together with DM-based distances separately
using the YMW16 and NE2001 Galactic electron density models. We find that an
age cutoff at $10^{5.75}$~yr with YMW16 DM-distances gives the best results
with a minimum uncertainty in $z_\odot$ and an asymptotically stable value for
$H$ showing that, at this age and below, the observed pulsar $z$-distribution
is dominated by the dispersion in their birth locations. From this sample of
115 pulsars, we obtain $z_\odot=13.4\pm$4.4~pc and $H=56.9\pm$6.5~pc, similar

layers and investigate the effect of population imbalance on the ground state
phase at different layer spacings and average densities. The attractive part of
the interlayer interaction could lead to the BEC-BCS crossover and the Fermi
surface mismatch between two layers results in interesting uniform and
nonuniform superfluid phases, which we have investigated here using the BCS
mean-field theory together with the superfluid-mass density criterion. The
density imbalance reduces the pairing gap. At low densities, where the system
is on the BEC side of the crossover, this reduction is quite smooth while a
dense system rapidly becomes normal at intermediate density polarizations.
Stable homogeneous superfluidity is predicted to appear on the phase diagram
when the dipolar length exceeds both the layer spacing and the average
intralayer distance between dipoles, a regime which should be readily
accessible experimentally. This homogeneous superfluid phase becomes unstable
at intermediate densities and layer spacings. We have also examined that these
uniform and inhomogeneous superfluid phases survive when the effects of
intralayer screenings are also incorporated in the formalism.

this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning method that combines the
triplet model and the global structure of the embedding space. We rely on a
smart mining procedure that produces effective training samples for a low
computational cost. In addition, we propose an adaptive controller that
automatically adjusts the smart mining hyper-parameters and speeds up the
convergence of the training process. We show empirically that our proposed
method allows for fast and more accurate training of triplet ConvNets than
other competing mining methods. Additionally, we show that our method achieves
new state-of-the-art embedding results for CUB-200-2011 and Cars196 datasets.

queries (CQs) and their extensions and restrictions in the dynamic complexity
framework of Patnaik and Immerman. Starting from the basic language of
quantifier-free conjunctions of positive atoms, it studies the impact of
additional operators and features - such as union, atomic negation and
quantification - on the dynamic expressiveness, for the standard semantics as
well as for Delta-semantics.
  Although many different combinations of these features are possible, they
basically yield five important fragments for the standard semantics,
characterized by the addition of (1) arbitrary quantification and atomic
negation, (2) existential quantification and atomic negation, (3) existential
quantification, (4) atomic negation (but no quantification), and by (5) no
addition to the basic language at all. While fragments (3), (4) and (5) can be
separated, it remains open whether fragments (1), (2) and (3) are actually
different. The fragments arising from Delta-semantics are also subsumed by the
standard fragments (1), (2) and (4). The main fragments of DynFO that had been
studied in previous work, DynQF and DynProp, characterized by quantifier-free
update programs with or without auxiliary functions, respectively, also fit
into this hierarchy: DynProp coincides with fragment (4) and DynQF is strictly
above fragment (4) and within fragment (3).
  As a further result, all (statically) FO-definable queries are captured by
fragment (2) and a complete characterization of these queries in terms of
non-recursive dynamic programs with existential update formulas with one
existential quantifier is given.

observe no significant improvement in the quality of Rabi oscillations. For
weak driving this is consistent with Overhauser field fluctuations modulating
the qubit splitting. For strong driving we infer that effective voltage noise
modulates the coupling strength between RF drive and the qubit, thereby
quickening Rabi decay. Application of CPMG dynamical decoupling sequences
consisting of up to n = 32 {\pi} pulses significantly prolongs qubit coherence,
leading to marginally longer dephasing times in the symmetric configuration.
This is consistent with dynamical decoupling from low frequency noise, but

depends sensitively on the assumed solid surface density in the surrounding

envelope and includes some hydrogen and helium, and the deep interior can have
a gradual heavy-element structure. Accordingly, Jupiter's core may not be
well-defined. Accurate measurements of Jupiter's gravitational field by Juno
could put constraints on Jupiter's core mass. However, as we suggest here, the

are synchronized, in D-TDD each cell dynamically allocates resources to the

theory, we derive closed-form expressions for the UL and DL packet throughput,
also capturing the impact of random traffic arrivals and packet
retransmissions. Through our analysis, which is validated via simulations, we
confirm that D-TDD outperforms S-TDD in DL, with the vice versa occurring in
UL, since asymmetric transmissions reduce DL interference at the expense of an
increased UL interference. We also find that in asymmetric scenarios, where
most of the traffic is in DL, D-TDD provides a DL packet throughput gain by
better controlling the queuing delay, and that such gain vanishes in the
light-traffic regime.

the secrete messages are communicated simultaneously between two legitimate
parties. The successful experimental demonstration of QSDC opens up the
possibilities for practical implementation of QD protocols. Thus, it is
necessary to analyze the practical security issues of QD protocols for future
implementation. Since the very first proposal for QD by Nguyen (Phys. Lett. A,

However, all of those leak half of the secret bits to the adversary through
classical communications of the measurement results. In this direction,

Measurement Device Independent Quantum Dialogue (MDI-QD) scheme which is
resistant to such information leakage as well as side channel attacks. In the
proposed protocol, Alice and Bob, two legitimate parties, are allowed to
prepare the states only. The states are measured by an untrusted third party
(UTP) who may himself behave as an adversary. We show that our protocol is
secure under this adversarial model. The current protocol does not require any

robustness might not be guaranteed in the QSDC protocol with quantum memory

engineering. The most famous and useful third order tensor is the piezoelectric
tensor, which plays a key role in the piezoelectric effect, first discovered by
Curie brothers. On the other hand, the Levi-Civita tensor is famous in tensor
calculus. In this paper, we study third order tensors and (third order)
hypermatrices systematically, by regarding a third order tensor as a linear
operator which transforms a second order tensor into a first order tensor, or a
first order tensor into a second order tensor. For a third order tensor, we
define its transpose, kernel tensor and L-eigenvalues. Here, ""L"" is named after
Levi-Civita. The transpose of a third order tensor is uniquely defined. In
particular, the transpose of the piezoelectric tensor is the inverse
piezoelectric tensor (the electrostriction tensor). The kernel tensor of a
third order tensor is a second order positive semi-definite symmetric tensor,
which is the product of that third order tensor and its transpose. We define
L-eigenvalues, singular values, C-eigenvalues and Z-eigenvalues for a third
order tensor. They are all invariants of that third order tensor. For a third
order partially symmetric tensor, we give its eigenvector decomposition. The
piezoelectric tensor, the inverse piezoelectric tensor, and third order
symmetric tensors are third order partially symmetric tensors. We make a
conjecture a third order symmetric tensor has seven independent invariants. We
raise the questions on how may independent invariants a third order tensor, a

phenomenon but its significance is difficult to prove or theoretically explain.
Here we consider each solar hemisphere as a separate dynamical system connected
with the other hemisphere via an unknown coupling parameter. We use a
non-linear dynamics approach to calculate the scale-dependent conditional
dispersion (CD) of sunspots between hemispheres. Using daily Greenwich sunspot
areas, we calculated the Neumann and Pearson chi-squared distances between CDs
as indices showing the direction of coupling. We introduce an additional index
of synchronization which shows the strength of coupling and allows us to
discriminate between complete synchronization and independency of hemispheres.
All indices are evaluated in a four-year moving window showing the evolution of
coupling between hemispheres. We find that the driver-response interrelation
changes between hemispheres have a few pulses during 130 years of Greenwich
data with an at least 40 years-long period of unidirectional coupling. These
sharp nearly simultaneous pulses of all causality indices are found at the
decay of some 11-year cycles. The pulse rate of this new phenomenon of dynamic
coupling is irregular: although the first two pulses repeat after 22-year Hale
cycles, the last two pulses repeat after three and four 11-year cycles
respectively. The last pulse occurs at the decay phase of Cycle 23 so the next
pulse will likely appear during the decay of future Cycle 25 or later. This new
phenomenon of dynamic coupling reveals additional constraints for understanding

to construct these priors including the survey selection functions (SSFs)

distance biases. Due to the decline of the SSFs in distance, the simple
1/parallax estimate only mildly underestimates distances. We test the accuracy
of measured line-of-sight velocities (v_los) by binning the samples in the
nominal v_los uncertainties. We find: a) the LAMOST v_los have a ~ -5 km/s
offset; b) the average LAMOST measurement error for v_los is ~7 km/s,
significantly smaller than, and nearly uncorrelated with the nominal LAMOST
estimates. The RAVE sample shows either a moderate distance underestimate, or
an unaccounted source of v_los dispersion (e_v) from measurement errors and
binary stars. For a subsample of suspected binary stars in RAVE, our methods
indicate significant distance underestimates. Separating a sample in
metallicity or kinematics to select thick-disc/halo stars, discriminates
between distance bias and e_v. For LAMOST, this separation yields consistency
with pure v_los measurement errors. We find an anomaly near longitude

and antiunitary operators on a Hilbert space H. In quantum physics, antiunitary
operators implement time inversion or a PCT symmetry, and in the modular theory
of operator algebras they arise as modular conjugations from cyclic separating
vectors of von Neumann algebras. We survey some of the key concepts at the
borderline between the theory of local observables (Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
in the sense of Araki--Haag--Kastler) and modular theory of operator algebras
from the perspective of antiunitary group representations. Here a central point
is to encode modular objects in standard subspaces V in H which in turn are in
one-to-one correspondence with antiunitary representations of the
multiplicative group R^x. Half-sided modular inclusions and modular
intersections of standard subspaces correspond to antiunitary representations
of Aff(R), and these provide the basic building blocks for a general theory
started in the 90s with the ground breaking work of Borchers and Wiesbrock and
developed in various directions in the QFT context. The emphasis of these notes
lies on the translation between configurations of standard subspaces as they
arise in the context of modular localization developed by Brunetti, Guido and
Longo, and the more classical context of von Neumann algebras with cyclic
separating vectors. Our main point is that configurations of standard subspaces
can be studied from the perspective of antiunitary Lie group representations
and the geometry of the corresponding spaces, which are often fiber bundles
over ordered symmetric spaces. We expect this perspective to provide new and
systematic insight into the much richer configurations of nets of local
observables in QFT.

we use aggregated network data to calibrate the probabilities at which agents

Interpreting the link probabilities as strategies for link formation, we find

cascade of several sub-models. Earlier sub-models are trained to handle easy
and confident regions, and they progressively feed-forward harder regions to
the next sub-model for processing. Convolutions are only calculated on these
regions to reduce computations. The proposed method possesses several
advantages. First, LC classifies most of the easy regions in the shallow stage
and makes deeper stage focuses on a few hard regions. Such an adaptive and
'difficulty-aware' learning improves segmentation performance. Second, LC
accelerates both training and testing of deep network thanks to early decisions
in the shallow stage. Third, in comparison to MC, LC is an end-to-end trainable

information about ongoing events and people. For topics with multiple competing
perspectives, such as political events or political candidates, bias in the top
ranked results significantly shapes public opinion. However, bias does not
emerge from an algorithm alone. It is important to distinguish between the bias
that arises from the data that serves as the input to the ranking system and
the bias that arises from the ranking system itself. In this paper, we propose
a framework to quantify these distinct biases and apply this framework to
politics-related queries on Twitter. We found that both the input data and the
ranking system contribute significantly to produce varying amounts of bias in
the search results and in different ways. We discuss the consequences of these
biases and possible mechanisms to signal this bias in social media search
systems' interfaces.

psychiatric symptoms and their neural underpinnings, which has resulted in poor
treatment outcomes. This situation has prompted us to shift from symptom-based
diagnosis to data-driven diagnosis, aiming to redefine psychiatric disorders as
disorders of neural circuitry. Promising candidates for data-driven diagnosis
include resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI)-based biomarkers.
Although biomarkers have been developed with the aim of diagnosing patients and
predicting the efficacy of therapy, the focus has shifted to the identification
of biomarkers that represent therapeutic targets, which would allow for more
personalized treatment approaches. This type of biomarker (i.e., theranostic
biomarker) is expected to elucidate the disease mechanism of psychiatric
conditions and to offer an individualized neural circuit-based therapeutic
target based on the neural cause of a condition. To this end, researchers have
developed rs-fcMRI-based biomarkers and investigated a causal relationship
between potential biomarkers and disease-specific behavior using functional MRI
(fMRI)-based neurofeedback on functional connectivity. In this review, we
introduce recent approach for creating a theranostic biomarker, which consists
mainly of two parts: (i) developing an rs-fcMRI-based biomarker that can
predict diagnosis and/or symptoms with high accuracy, and (ii) the introduction
of a proof-of-concept study investigating the relationship between normalizing
the biomarker and symptom changes using fMRI-based neurofeedback. In parallel
with the introduction of recent studies, we review rs-fcMRI-based biomarker and
fMRI-based neurofeedback, focusing on the technological improvements and

changes between a fluorescent donor and an acceptor anchored to overhangs of a
forked DNA duplex. However, it has lacked single-base pair (1-bp) resolution
required for revealing stepping dynamics in unwinding because FRET signals are
usually blurred by thermal fluctuations of the overhangs. We designed a
nanotensioner in which a short DNA is bent to exert a force on the overhangs,
just as in optical/magnetic tweezers. The strategy improved the resolution of
FRET to 0.5 bp, high enough to uncover the differences in DNA unwinding by
yeast Pif1 and E. coli RecQ whose unwinding behaviors cannot be differentiated
by currently practiced methods. We found that Pif1 exhibits 1-bp-stepping
kinetics, while RecQ breaks 1 bp at a time but questers the nascent nucleotides
and releases them randomly. The high-resolution data allowed us to propose a
three-parameter model to quantitatively interpret the apparently different
unwinding behaviors of the two helicases which belong to two superfamilies.

hypervelocity white dwarfs whose progenitors were massive runaway stars.
Runaways which are even more massive will themselves go supernova, producing a
remnant whose velocity will be modulated by a supernova kick. This latter

and variance asymptotics and establish distributional limits. The results apply
to random walks both with drift (the mean of random walk increments) and with
no drift under mild moments assumptions on the increments.
  Assuming increments of the random walk have finite second moment and non-zero
mean, Snyder and Steele showed that $n^{-1} L_n$ converges almost surely to a
deterministic limit, and proved an upper bound on the variance Var$[ L_n] =
O(n)$. We show that $n^{-1}$Var$[L_n]$ converges and give a simple expression
for the limit, which is non-zero for walks outside a certain degenerate class.
This answers a question of Snyder and Steele. Furthermore, we prove a central
limit theorem for $L_n$ in the non-degenerate case.
  Then we focus on the perimeter length with no drift and area with both drift
and zero-drift cases. These results complement and contrast with previous work
and establish non-Gaussian distributional limits. We deduce these results from
weak convergence statements for the convex hulls of random walks to scaling
limits defined in terms of convex hulls of certain Brownian motions. We give
bounds that confirm that the limiting variances in our results are non-zero.

exhibit similar dynamics of social contagion. The precise mechanisms of
judgment propagation are not well understood, however, because it is difficult
to control for confounding factors such as homophily or dynamic network
structures. We introduce a novel experimental design that renders possible the
stringent study of judgment propagation. In this design, experimental chains of
individuals can revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after
observing a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good performer at
the top of a chain created a performance gap, which triggered waves of judgment
propagation down the chain. We evaluated the dynamics of judgment propagation
experimentally. Despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals,
the reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social
distance of three to four degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer
simulations showed that the speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially
with the social distance from the source. We show that information distortion
and the overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level
mechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our
results contribute to the understanding of social contagion processes, and our
experimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study judgment
propagation in the laboratory.

the most impactful recent contributions have been made possible through the
integration of recent Machine Learning methods (based in particular on Deep
Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks) with more traditional ones (e.g.
Monte-Carlo tree search, goal babbling exploration or addressable memory
systems). Regarding embodiment, we note that the traditional benchmark tasks
(e.g. visual classification or board games) are becoming obsolete as
state-of-the-art learning algorithms approach or even surpass human performance
in most of them, having recently encouraged the development of first-person 3D
game platforms embedding realistic physics. Building upon this analysis, we
first propose an embodied cognitive architecture integrating heterogenous
sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence into a unified framework. We demonstrate
the utility of our approach by showing how major contributions of the field can
be expressed within the proposed framework. We then claim that benchmarking
environments need to reproduce ecologically-valid conditions for bootstrapping
the acquisition of increasingly complex cognitive skills through the concept of
a cognitive arms race between embodied agents.

unentangled one. Given an initial state, a target state, and a Hamiltonian with
a set of permissible controls, can we reach the target state with coherent
quantum evolution and, in that case, what is the minimum time required? The
adiabatic theorem provides a far from optimal solution in the presence of a
spectral gap. Optimal control yields the fastest possible way of reaching the
target state and helps identify unreachable states. In the context of a simple
quantum system, we provide examples of both reachable and unreachable target
ground states and show that the unreachability is due to a symmetry. We find
the optimal protocol in the reachable case using three different approaches:
(i) a brute-force numerical minimization (ii) an efficient numerical
minimization using the bang-bang ansatz expected from the Pontryagin minimum
principle, and (iii) direct solution of the Pontryagin boundary value problem,
which yields an analytical understanding of the numerically obtained optimal
protocols. Interestingly, our system provides an example of singular control,
where the Pontryagin theorem does not guarantee bang-bang protocols.
Nevertheless, all three approaches give the same bang-bang protocol.

interest in various low-level vision tasks and has led to several

convex optimization with sparsity-promoting convex regularization was usually
regarded as a standard scheme for estimating sparse signals in noise. However,
using convex regularization can not still obtain the correct sparsity solution
under some practical problems including image inverse problems. In this paper
we propose a non-convex weighted $\ell_p$ minimization based group sparse

tractable and robust, the generalized soft-thresholding (GST) algorithm is
adopted to solve the non-convex $\ell_p$ minimization problem. In addition, to
improve the accuracy of the nonlocal similar patches selection, an adaptive
patch search (APS) scheme is proposed. Experimental results have demonstrated
that the proposed approach not only outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising

epochs of high precision photometry for SN 2014J from 277 days to 1181 days
past the $B-$band maximum light. The reprocessing of electrons and X-rays
emitted by the radioactive decay chain $^{57}$Co$\rightarrow ^{57}$Fe are
needed to explain the significant flattening of both the $F606W$-band and the
pseudo-bolometric light curves. The flattening confirms previous predictions
that the late-time evolution of type Ia supernova luminosities requires
additional energy input from the decay of $^{57}$Co (Seitenzahl et al. 2009).
By assuming the $F606W$-band luminosity scales with the bolometric luminosity

$^{57}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni$\sim$0.065$_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ is required. This mass ratio

heat a large volume and correspondingly large mass of gas in their

there has been a shift in the way information is produced and consumed.
Earlier, the only producers of information were traditional news organizations,
which broadcast the same carefully-edited information to all consumers over
mass media channels. Whereas, now, in online social media, any user can be a
producer of information, and every user selects which other users she connects
to, thereby choosing the information she consumes. Moreover, the personalized
recommendations that most social media sites provide also contribute towards
the information consumed by individual users. In this work, we define a concept
of information diet -- which is the topical distribution of a given set of
information items (e.g., tweets) -- to characterize the information produced
and consumed by various types of users in the popular Twitter social media. At
a high level, we find that (i) popular users mostly produce very specialized
diets focusing on only a few topics; in fact, news organizations (e.g.,
NYTimes) produce much more focused diets on social media as compared to their
mass media diets, (ii) most users' consumption diets are primarily focused
towards one or two topics of their interest, and (iii) the personalized
recommendations provided by Twitter help to mitigate some of the topical
imbalances in the users' consumption diets, by adding information on diverse
topics apart from the users' primary topics of interest.

Conjointly, we analyse the AIA EUV light curves and images in order to identify
the post-flare loops, their temporal and thermal evolution. By combining both
analysis we are able to propose a detailed scenario that explains the dynamics
of the flare. Our topological analysis shows that in addition to a null-point
topology with the fan separatrix, the spine lines and its surrounding
Quasi-Separatix Layers halo (typical for a circular flare), a flux rope and its
hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) are enclosed below the null. By comparing the
magnetic field topology and the EUV post-flare loops we obtain an almost
perfect match 1) between the footpoints of the separatrices and the EUV
1600~\AA{} ribbons and 2) between the HFT's field line footpoints and bright
spots observed inside the circular ribbons. We showed, for the first time in a
confined flare, that magnetic reconnection occured initially at the HFT, below
the flux rope. Reconnection at the null point between the flux rope and the
overlying field is only initiated in a second phase. In addition, we showed
that the EUV late phase observed after the main flare episode are caused by the
cooling loops of different length which have all reconnected at the null point
during the impulsive phase.

the images acquired in the other filters. Such an approach optimizes the
detection of relatively hot stars and allows the detection of complete sample
of BSSs even in the central region of high-density clusters, because the light

stellar systems, is sensibly reduced at UV wavelengths. Our UV-guided
selections of BSSs have been compared to the samples obtained in previous,
optical-driven surveys, clearly demonstrating the efficiency of the UV
approach. In each cluster we also measured the parameter A+, defined as the
area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a

the data matrix elements are real numbers, identically and independently
generated from a Gaussian distribution; in this setting we analytically find
that the distribution of the inferred interactions is Gaussian. For data of
Boolean type, more realistic in practice, the inferred interactions do not
generally follow a Gaussian. However, extensive numerical simulations indicate
that their distribution can be characterized by a single function determined by
a few system parameters after normalization by the standard deviation. This
property holds for both RLS and plmDCA and may be exploitable for inferring the

  ultrafast Grover algorithm",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last decades, there have been many proposals for quantum
computation. One of the promising candidates is adiabatic quantum computation
(AQC). The central idea of AQC is about finding the ground state of a system
with a problem Hamiltonian via particular adiabatic passages, starting from an
initialized ground state of a simple Hamiltonian. One disadvantage of AQC is
the significant growth of necessary runtime, in particular when there are
quantum phase transitions during the AQC passages. Here we propose a
nondeterministic ground state cooling quantum computation model based on
selective projection measurements on an ancilla coupled to the system with the
problem Hamiltonian previously cooled by conventional techniques. We illustrate
the model by Grover search problem and show that our nondeterministic model
requires a constant or at most logarithmic runtime and can also get rid of
possible difficulties in preparing the ground state of the simple Hamiltonian.

enhanced by mode locking through nuclear focusing, where the synchronization of
the electron spin to periodic pulsing is slowly transferred to the nuclear
spins of the semiconductor material, mediated by the hyperfine interaction
between these. The external magnetic field that drives the Larmor oscillations
of the electron spin also subjects the nuclear spins to a Zeeman-like coupling,
albeit a much weaker one. For typical magnetic fields used in experiments, the
energy scale of the nuclear Zeeman effect is comparable to that of the
hyperfine interaction, so that it is not negligible. In this work, we analyze
the influence of the nuclear Zeeman effect on mode locking quantitatively.
Within a perturbative framework, we calculate the Overhauser-field distribution
after a prolonged period of pulsing. We find that the nuclear Zeeman effect can
exchange resonant and non-resonant frequencies. We distinguish between models
with a single type and with multiple types of nuclei. For the latter case, the
positions of the resonances depend on the individual $g$ factors, rather than
on the average value.

that under PAPC has received less attention. A reason is that efficient
solutions for this problem are hard to find. The goal of this paper is to
devise an efficient algorithm for determining the capacity region of Gaussian
MIMO BCs subject to PAPC, which is scalable to the problem size. To this end,
we first transform the weighted sum capacity maximization problem, which is
inherently nonconvex with the input covariance matrices, into a convex
formulation in the dual multiple access channel by minimax duality. Then we
derive a computationally efficient algorithm combining the concept of
alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. The proposed
algorithm achieves much lower complexity compared to an existing interiorpoint

Protocol by most of the countries in the world, the global energy policy
framework has undergone a paradigm shift, as human societies have been leaving
aside the sole economic growth to embrace the broader concept of sustainable
development. As new electrification vectors, modern renewable power systems,
such as solar PV, have sprung up in the wake of this major mutation and have
typically been following an exponential growth since the mid-nineties.
Electricity as well as its lack indeed holds a central position within the
human development apparatus, from highly interconnected centralized power
networks reaching 100 % of the population in developed countries, to the almost
500 millions people without access to electricity in the multidimensionally
poor rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The encounter of the worldwide energy
context being changed with each of these specific social-energy paradigms has
ended up considering two strategies for integrating renewable resources in
power systems: the grid-connected architecture for meeting the sustainable
development requirements, and the rural off-grid electrification for settling
the lack of human development. By means of a historical and cross-sectional
overview, we depict here the ins and outs of this protean pattern and, using
the case of solar PV, analyze how it has eventually affected the development

has provided a promising way to reduce or move the attack surface that is
available for exploitation by an adversary. However, the current network- based
MTD obfuscates networks indiscriminately that makes some networks key services,
such as web and DNS services, unavailable, because many information of these
services has to be opened to the outside and remain real without compromising
their usability. Moreover, the indiscriminate obfuscation also severely reduces
the performance of networks. In this paper, we propose CHAOS, an SDN
(Software-defined networking)-based MTD system, which discriminately obfuscates
hosts with different security levels in a network. In CHAOS, we introduce a
Chaos Tower Obfuscation (CTO) method, which uses a Chaos Tower Structure (CTS)
to depict the hierarchy of all the hosts in an intranet and provides a more
unpredictable and flexible obfuscation method. We also present the design of
CHAOS, which leverages SDN features to obfuscate the attack surface including
IP obfuscation, ports obfuscation, and fingerprint obfuscation thereby
enhancing the unpredictability of the networking environment. We develop fast
CTO algorithms to achieve a different degree of obfuscation for the hosts in
each layer. Our experimental results show that a network protected by CHAOS is
capable of decreasing the percentage of information disclosure effectively to
guarantee the normal flow of traffic.

macrorealism in the context of a system described by a single dichotomic
variable Q. This is the view that a macroscopic system evolving in time
possesses definite properties which can be determined without disturbing the
future or past state. The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities, the most
commonly-studied test, are only necessary conditions for macrorealism, but
building on earlier work it is shown that when the four three-time LG
inequalities are augmented with a certain set of two-time inequalities also of
the LG form, Fine's theorem applies and these augmented conditions are then
both necessary and sufficient. A comparison is carried out with a very
different set of necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism, namely
the no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions proposed by Brukner, Clemente,
Kofler and others, which ensure that all probabilities for Q at one and two
times are independent of whether earlier or intermediate measurements are made
in a given run, and do not require (but imply) the LG inequalities. We argue
that tests based on the LG inequalities have the form of very weak classicality
conditions and can be satisfied in the face of moderate interference effects,
but those based on NSIT conditions have the form of much stronger coherence
witness conditions, satisfied only for zero interference. The two tests differ
in their implementation of non-invasive measurability so are testing different
notions of macrorealism: the augmented LG tests are indirect, entailing a
combination of the results of different experiments with only compatible
quantities measured in each experimental run, in close analogy with Bell tests,
and are primarily tests for macrorealism per se; by contrast the NSIT tests
entail sequential measurements of incompatible quantities and are primarily
tests for non-invasiveness

to quantum stabilization and open-system simulation, rely on the ability to
implement a target quantum channel over a specified time interval within
prescribed accuracy. This can be achieved by engineering a suitable unitary
dynamics of the system of interest along with its environment -- which,
depending on the available level of control, is fully or partly exploited as a
coherent quantum controller. After formalizing a controllability framework for
completely positive trace-preserving quantum dynamics, we provide sufficient
conditions on the environment state and dimension that allow for the
realization of relevant classes of quantum channels -- including extreme
channels, stochastic unitaries, or simply any channel. The results hinge on
generalizations of Stinespring's dilation via a subsystem principle. In the
process, we show that a conjecture by Lloyd on the minimal dimension of the
environment required for arbitrary open-system simulation, albeit formally
disproved, can in fact be salvaged -- provided that classical randomization is
included among the available resources. Existing measurement-based feedback
protocols for universal simulation, dynamical decoupling, and dissipative state

applications, and the resources they employ discussed in the light of the

elastic interface in a random medium by solving a particularly suited model of
hopping interacting particles that belongs to the quenched-Edwards-Wilkinson
depinning universality class. The model allows us to compare the cases of
uniformly activated and Arrhenius activated hops. In the former case, the
velocity accurately follows a standard scaling law of the force and noise
intensity with the analog of the thermal rounding exponent satisfying a
modified ""hyperscaling"" relation. For the Arrhenius activation, we find, both
numerically and analytically, that the standard scaling form fails for any
value of the thermal rounding exponent. We propose an alternative scaling
incorporating logarithmic corrections that appropriately fits the numerical
results. We argue that this anomalous scaling is related to the strong
correlation between activated hops that, alternated with deterministic
depinning-like avalanches, occur below the depinning threshold. We rationalize
the spatiotemporal patterns by making an analogy of the present model in the
near-threshold creep regime with some well-known models with extremal dynamics,
particularly the Bak-Sneppen model.

including the cases of $\mathbb R^n$, Heisenberg, and more general stratified

i.e. the hypoelliptic homogeneous left-invariant differential operators on the
group. The best constants are expressed in the variational form as well as in
terms of the ground state solutions of the corresponding nonlinear subelliptic
equations. The orders of these equations can be high depending on the Sobolev
space order in the Sobolev or Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, or may be
fractional. Applications are obtained also to equations with lower order terms
given by different hypoelliptic operators. Already in the case of $\mathbb
R^n$, the obtained results extend the classical relations by Weinstein to a
wide range of nonlinear elliptic equations of high orders with elliptic low
order terms and a wide range of interpolation inequalities of
Gagliardo-Nirenberg type. However, the proofs are different from those ivy
Weinstein because of the impossibility of using the rearrangement inequalities
already in the setting of the Heisenberg group. The considered class of graded
groups is the most general class of nilpotent Lie groups where one can still
consider hypoelliptic homogeneous invariant differential operators and the
corresponding subelliptic differential equations.

that one can use the incomplete information contained in this spectrum as prior

the sequences or strings which are produced by a source. We may have the source
without a computable algorithm for that but it can produce compressible or
incompressible strings. For example, so far there is no computable algorithm
that can define the abstract meaning of randomness even the easiest one,
Bernoulli probability distribution. Historically and philosophically there many
scientist believe the existence of the algorithm for a random process is a
contradiction because in their opinion, in the definition of a random variable,
implicitly assumed that there is no reason for the happening of an event and we
just know the probabilities. There is however no need to enter into this matter
here. As in the paper mentioned, all the algorithms for simulating a random

binary neutron star (NS) mergers, which could give rise to short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs). The strong magnetic fields and fast rotation of these magnetars
make them promising sources for gravitational wave (GW) detection using ground
based GW interferometers. Based on the observed masses of Galactic NS-NS
binaries, by assuming different equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter, we
investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by an
ensemble of newly born massive magnetars. The massive magnetar formation rate
is estimated through: (i) the SGRB formation rate (hereafter entitled as MFR1);
(ii) the NS-NS merger rate (hereafter entitled as MFR2). We find that for
massive magnetars with masses $M_{\rm mg}=2.4743 M_\odot$, if EOS CDDM2 is
assumed, the resultant SGWBs may be detected by the future Einstein Telescope
(ET) even for MFR1 with minimal local formation rate, and for MFR2 with a local
merger rate $\dot{\rho}_{\rm c}^{\rm o}(0)\lesssim 10$ ${\rm Mpc}^{-3}{\rm
Myr}^{-1}$. However, if EOS BSk21 is assumed, the SGWB may be detectable by the
ET for MFR1 with the maximal local formation rate. Moreover, the background
spectra show cutoffs at about 350 Hz in the case of EOS BSk21, and at 124 Hz
for CDDM2, respectively. We suggest that if the cutoff at $\sim100$ Hz in the
background spectrum from massive magnetars could be detected, then the quark

relatively small TOV maximum masses, would be excluded.

adopting an mildly super-Eddington rate $\dot{M}=6\times10^{-8}M_\odot~{\rm

only in accreting NSs with quite elastic crusts (slippage factor $s=0.05$), the
toroidal magnetic fields can be amplified within 1 Myrs, which is assumed to be
the longest duration of the RLOF. These IMXBs will evolve into NS+white dwarf
(WD) binaries if they are dynamical stable. However, before the formation of
NS+WD binaries, the high stellar density in the GC will probably lead to
frequent encounters between the NS+evolved star binaries (in post-early Case B
mass transfer phase) and NSs or exchange encounters with other stars, which may
produce single NSs. These NSs will evolve into magnetars when the amplified
poloidal magnetic fields diffuse out to the NS surfaces. Consequently, our
results provide a possible explanation for the origin of the GC magnetar SGR

slow mode in HeH or CH plasmas is the least damped mode and will be excited in
SBS, while the fast mode in AuB plasmas is the least damped mode and will be
excited in SBS. Due to strong Landau damping, the SBS in H or HeH plasmas is
strong convective instability, while the SBS in AuB plasmas is absolute
instability due to the weak Landau damping. However, although the SBS in CH
plasmas is weak convective instability in the linear theory, the SBS will
transform into absolute instability due to decreasing linear Landau damping by
particles trapping. These results give a detail research of the IAW modes
excitation and the properties of SBS in different species plasmas, thus
providing the possibility of controlling SBS by increasing the linear Landau
damping of the IAW by changing ion species.

which ensures that the transfer function between any two points in space is
identical, regardless of geometrical or material asymmetries. Breaking this
transmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation
and source protection. So far, devices that break reciprocity have been mostly
considered in dynamic systems, for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical
wave propagation associated with spatio-temporal variations. Here we show that
it is possible to strongly break reciprocity in static systems, realizing
mechanical metamaterials that, by combining large nonlinearities with suitable
geometrical asymmetries, and possibly topological features, exhibit vastly
different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well
as one-way displacement amplification. In addition to extending non-reciprocity
and isolation to statics, our work sheds new light on the understanding of
energy propagation in non-linear materials with asymmetric crystalline
structures and topological properties, opening avenues for energy absorption,
conversion and harvesting, soft robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics.

highly accurate clocks, comparable in stability to atomic clocks; secondly, a
small subset of pulsars, millisecond X-ray pulsars, provide all the necessary
ingredients for a passive galactic positioning system. This is known in
astronautics as X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV). XNAV is comparable to
GPS, except that it operates on a galactic scale. I propose a SETI-XNAV
research program to test the hypothesis that this pulsar positioning system
might be an instance of galactic-scale engineering by extraterrestrial beings
(section 4). The paper starts by exposing the basics of pulsar navigation
(section 2), continues with a critique of the rejection of the extraterrestrial
hypothesis when pulsars were first discovered (section 3). The core section 4
proposes lines of inquiry for SETI-XNAV, related to: the pulsar distribution
and power in the galaxy; their population; their evolution; possible pulse
synchronizations; pulsar usability when navigating near the speed of light;
decoding galactic coordinates; directed panspermia; and information content in
pulses. Even if pulsars are natural, they are likely to be used as standards by
ETIs in the galaxy (section 5). I discuss possible objections and potential
benefits for humanity, whether the research program succeeds or not (section
6).

  Savovic and Julian Higgins","Label-invariant models for the analysis of meta-epidemiological data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rich meta-epidemiological data sets have been collected to explore
associations between intervention effect estimates and study-level
characteristics. Welton et al. proposed models for the analysis of
meta-epidemiological data, but these models are restrictive because they force
heterogeneity among studies with a particular characteristic to be at least as
large as that among studies without the characteristic. In this paper we
present alternative models that are invariant to the labels defining the two
categories of studies. To exemplify the methods, we use a collection of
meta-analyses in which the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool has been implemented. We
first investigate the influence of small trial sample sizes (less than 100
participants), before investigating the influence of multiple methodological
flaws (inadequate or unclear sequence generation, allocation concealment and
blinding). We fit both the Welton et al. model and our proposed label-invariant
model and compare the results. Estimates of mean bias associated with the trial
characteristics and of between-trial variances are not very sensitive to the
choice of model. Results from fitting a univariable model show that
heterogeneity variance is, on average, 88% greater among trials with less than
100 participants. Based on a multivariable model, heterogeneity variance is, on
average, 25% greater among trials with inadequate/unclear sequence generation,
51% greater among trials with inadequate/unclear blinding, and 23% lower among
trials with inadequate/unclear allocation concealment, though the 95% intervals
for these ratios are very wide. Our proposed label-invariant models for
meta-epidemiological data analysis facilitate investigations of between-study
heterogeneity attributable to certain study characteristics.
