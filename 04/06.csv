for ultra-high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectroscopy of background stars in the

of HST provides the crucial benefit of eliminating the need for error-prone
telluric correction methods in the part of the spectrum where the C60+ bands
lie, and terrestrial water vapor contamination is severe. Our STIS spectrum of
the heavily-reddened B0 star BD63\,1964 reaches an unprecedented S/N for this
instrument ($\sim600-800$), allowing the detection of the diffuse interstellar
band (DIB) at 9577 \AA\ attributed to C60+ as well as new DIBs in the near-IR.
Unfortunately, the presence of overlapping stellar lines, and the unexpected
weakness of the C60+ bands in this sightline, prevents conclusive detection of
the weaker C60+ bands. A probable correlation between the 9577 \AA\ DIB
strength and interstellar radiation field is identified, which suggests that
more strongly-irradiated interstellar sightlines will provide the optimal

transmission vs. altitude was sensitive to the presence of N2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4,
C2H6, and haze. We derived line-of-sight abundances and local number densities
for the 5 molecular species, and line-of-sight optical depth and extinction
coefficients for the haze. We found the following major conclusions: 1) We
confirmed temperatures in Pluto's upper atmosphere that were colder than
expected before the New Horizons flyby, with upper atmospheric temperatures
near 65-68 K. The inferred enhanced Jeans escape rates were (3e22-7e22) N2/s
and (4e25-8e25) CH4/s at the exobase (at a radius of ~2900 km, or an altitude
of ~1710 km). 2) We measured CH4 abundances from 80 to 1200 km above the
surface. A joint analysis of the Alice CH4 and Alice and REX N2 measurements
implied a very stable lower atmosphere with a small eddy diffusion coefficient,
most likely between 550 and 4000 cm2/s. Such a small eddy diffusion coefficient
placed the homopause within 12 km of the surface, giving Pluto a small
planetary boundary layer. The inferred CH4 surface mixing ratio was
~0.28-0.35%. 3) The abundance profiles of the C2Hx hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4,
C2H6) were not simply exponential with altitude. We detected local maxima in
line-of-sight abundance near 410 km altitude for C2H4, near 320 km for C2H2,
and an inflection point or the suggestion of a local maximum at 260 km for
C2H6. We also detected local minima near 200 km altitude for C2H4, near 170 km
for C2H2, and an inflection point or minimum near 170-200 km for C2H6. These
compared favorably with models for hydrocarbon production near 300-400 km and
haze condensation near 200 km, especially for C2H2 and C2H4 (Wong et al. 2017).
4) We found haze that had an extinction coefficient approximately proportional
to N2 density.

Applying the approach of Klimontovich (1967) we obtain the retarded time

replaces Klimontovich's equation in cases when the direct-interaction effects
have to be taken into account. This becomes important in all systems where the

treatment effect estimates from randomized trials. The outcome distributions of
participants with missing and observed data are often different, which
increases the risk of bias. Causal inference methods may aid in reducing the
bias and improving efficiency by incorporating baseline variables into the
analysis. In particular, doubly robust estimators incorporate estimates of two
nuisance parameters: the outcome regression and the missingness mechanism, to
adjust for differences in the observed and unobserved groups that can be
explained by observed covariates. Such nuisance parameters are traditionally
estimated using parametric models, which generally preclude consistent
estimation, particularly in moderate to high dimensions. Recent research on
missing data has focused on data-adaptive estimation of the nuisance parameters
in order to achieve consistency, but the large sample properties of such
estimators are poorly understood. In this article we discuss a doubly robust
estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN) under
data-adaptive consistent estimation of the outcome regression or the
missingness mechanism. We provide a formula for an asymptotically valid
confidence interval under minimal assumptions. We show that our proposed
estimator has smaller finite-sample bias compared to standard doubly robust
estimators. We present a simulation study demonstrating the enhanced
performance of our estimators in terms of bias, efficiency, and coverage of the
confidence intervals. We present the results of an illustrative example: a

deformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface
impact, elastomeric sphere deform significantly, resulting in large-scale
material oscillations within the sphere, resulting in unique nested cavities.
We study these phenomena experimentally with high speed imaging and image
processing techniques. The water entry behavior of deformable spheres differs
from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as
well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this
deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact
conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an
effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for
time to cavity pinch-off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres.
Our results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period

in the out-of-plane direction (the direction of the reconnection electric
field) with an amplitude of around $\pm 10$~mV/m, which is much greater than
the reconnection electric field of around $0.1$~mV/m. Such large values of the

machine learning applications. Formal understanding on what makes these

still significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects
prior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this
work, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum
physics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel
theoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each
layer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias.
Specifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep
convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave
function, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This
facilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined
quantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate
correlation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a
deep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available. This description
enables us to carry a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, with
which we demonstrate a direct control over the inductive bias of the deep
network via its channel numbers, that are related to the min-cut in the
underlying graph. This result is relevant to any practitioner designing a
network for a specific task. We theoretically analyze ConvACs, and empirically
validate our findings on more common ConvNets which involve ReLU activations

convolutional network in well-defined graph-theoretic tools and the formal
connection to quantum entanglement, are two interdisciplinary bridges that are

even for a magnetic field strength not assumed to be in equipartition, a
disparity of factor of approximately 2 exists between the spectral age and that
determined from a dynamical standpoint. We confirm that the injection index of
both sources (as derived from the lobe emission) remains steeper than
classically assumed values even when considered on well resolved scales at low
frequencies, but find an unexpected sharp discontinuity between the spectrum of
the hotspots and the surrounding lobe emission. We suggest that this
discrepancy is due to the absorption of hotspot emission and/or non-homogeneous

blackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected
by the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European
Extremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from
neutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic
center, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark
matter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or
spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \times 10^{-45}$
cm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For
lighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with
dark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter,
it scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for
capture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could
determine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron
stars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur

particular, the neural network outperforms conventional methods in classifying
individual eigenstates pertaining to a single disorder realization. It allows
us to map out the structure of these eigenstates across the transition with

that SNe launch highly supersonic winds with properties that agree reasonably
well with expectations from analytic models. The energy loading ($\eta_E =
\dot{E}_{\rm wind} / \dot{E}_{\rm SN}$) of the winds in our simulations are
well converged with spatial resolution while the wind mass loading ($\eta_M =

that SNRs with cooling radii greater than the local scale height breakout of
the disc and power the wind. This model successfully explains the dependence
(or lack thereof) of $\eta_E$ (and by extension $\eta_M$) on the gas surface
density, star formation efficiency, disc radius, and the clustering of SNe. The
winds in the majority of our simulations are weaker than expected in reality,

technique employs prior measurements of source positions and surface brightness
profiles from a high-resolution fiducial band from the VISTA Deep Extragalactic
Observations (VIDEO) survey to model and fit the fluxes at lower-resolution
bands. We discuss our implementation of The Tractor over a square degree test
region within the XMM-LSS field with deep imaging in 12 NIR/optical bands. Our
new multi-band source catalogs offer a number of advantages over traditional
position-matched catalogs, including 1) consistent source cross-identification
between bands, 2) de-blending of sources that are clearly resolved in the
fiducial band but blended in the lower-resolution SERVS data, 3) a higher
source detection fraction in each band, 4) a larger number of candidate
galaxies in the redshift range 5 < z < 6, and 5) a statistically significant
improvement in the photometric redshift accuracy as evidenced by the
significant decrease in the fraction of outliers compared to spectroscopic
redshifts. Thus, forced photometry using The Tractor offers a means of
improving the accuracy of multi-band extragalactic surveys designed for galaxy
evolution studies. We will extend our application of this technique to the full
SERVS footprint in the future.

momentum in the disk even in the absence of a magnetic field, and are most
pronounced for secondary-to-primary mass ratios larger than $0.6$. We further
analyze carbon burning in these systems to assess the possibility of
detonation. Unlike the case of a $1.1 + 1.0 M_{\odot}$ C/O WD binary, we find
that WD binary systems with lower mass and smaller mass ratios do not detonate
as SNe Ia up to $\sim8-22$ outer dynamical times. Two additional models do
however undergo net heating, and their secular increase in temperature could
possibly result in a detonation on timescales longer than those considered

an object being a lens by performing a lens model fit. The second method,

quasars. The third method makes use of spectroscopic data to look for emission
lines from objects at a different redshift from that of the main galaxy. We
find 15 definite lenses, 36 highly probable lenses and 282 possible lenses.
Among the three methods, YATTALENS, which was developed specifically for this

cosmological scales. The gas accreted from the cosmic field is thermalized
inside the cluster halo. Gas entropy and pressure are expected to have a
self-similar behaviour with their radial distribution following a power law and
a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile, respectively. This has been shown
also in many different hydrodynamical simulations. We derive the
spatially-resolved thermodynamical properties of 47 X-ray galaxy clusters
observed with Chandra in the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.2, the largest sample
investigated so far in this redshift range with X-rays spectroscopy, with a
particular care in reconstructing the gas entropy and pressure radial profiles.
We search for deviation from the self-similar behaviour and look for possible
evolution with redshift. The entropy and pressure profiles lie very close to
the baseline prediction from gravitational structure formation. We show that
these profiles deviate from the baseline prediction as function of redshift, in
particular at z > 0.75, where, in the central regions, we observe higher values
of the entropy (by a factor of 2.2) and systematically lower estimates (by a
factor of 2.5) of the pressure. The effective polytropic index, which retains
informations about the thermal distribution of the gas, shows a slight linear
positive evolution with the redshift and the concentration of the dark matter
distribution. A prevalence of non-cool-core, disturbed systems, as we observe
at higher redshifts, can explain such behaviours.

show the existence of doublets of Floquet states which are respectively even

in extracting information on hadronic amplitudes assuming the values of the CKM

several solutions, which do not fully support the hierarchy of hadronic
amplitudes usually expected from theoretical arguments (colour suppression,
suppression of electroweak penguins), as illustrated from computations within

that the basic finite geometric objects enabling such a diversity of physical
applications of the MVL are the unique generalized quadrangles with lines of
size three, their one point extensions as well as their other extensions
isomorphic to affine polar spaces of rank three and order two. In a previous
work we have already connected generalized quadrangles to the structure of
cubic Jordan algebras related to entropy fomulas of black holes and strings in
five dimensions. In some respect the present paper can be regarded as a
generalization of that analysis for also providing a finite geometric

of a text are linked to each other. Knowledge about this socalled discourse
structure has been applied successfully to several natural language processing
tasks. This work studies the use of rhetorical relations for Information
Retrieval (IR): Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and
retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be
useful to IR? We present a language model modification that considers
rhetorical relations when estimating the relevance of a document to a query.
Empirical evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC settings shows
that certain rhetorical relations can benefit retrieval effectiveness notably
(> 10% in mean average precision over a state-of-the-art baseline).

correlation function is studied, and a method using opposite-charge pair data
to constrain its contributions to the measured correlations is described. The
measured source sizes are substantially larger in more central collisions and
are observed to decrease with increasing pair $k_{\mathrm{T}}$. A correlation
of the radii with the local charged-particle density is demonstrated. The
scaling of the extracted radii with the mean number of participating nucleons
is also used to compare a selection of initial-geometry models. The cross-term
$R_\mathrm{ol}$ is measured as a function of rapidity, and a nonzero value is
observed with $5.1\sigma$ combined significance for $-1 < y^{\star}_{\pi\pi} <

the entangled resource we employ here is given by two interacting spin-1/2

The interaction between the qubits is described by a Heisenberg-like
Hamiltonian, encompassing the Ising, the XX, the XY, the XXX, and XXZ models,
with or without external fields. For all those models we show analytically that
the probabilistic protocol is exactly equal to the deterministic one whenever
we have no external field. However, when we turn on the field the probabilistic
protocol outperforms the deterministic one in several interesting ways. Under
certain scenarios, for example, the efficiency (average fidelity) of the
probabilistic protocol is greater than the deterministic one and increases with
increasing temperature, a counterintuitive behavior. We also show regimes in
which the probabilistic protocol operates with relatively high success rates
and, at the same time, with efficiency greater than the classical limit 2/3, a
threshold that cannot be surpassed by any protocol using only classical
resources (no entanglement shared between Alice and Bob). The deterministic
protocol's efficiency under the same conditions is below 2/3, highlighting that
the probabilistic protocol is the only one yielding a genuine quantum
teleportation. We also show that near the quantum critical points for almost
all those models the qualitative and quantitative behaviors of the efficiency
change considerably, even at finite T.

selection statistically represent the true population of DLAs. However, we
caution that studies of DLA metallicities should take into the account the

submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face

invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the
(currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for
maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system
constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation
using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size
of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively).
We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy
algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm,
called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to
$k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system
constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$
function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and
show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller
than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we
compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in
a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that
while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline,
it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.

propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to
address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm
that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the
output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the
solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of
optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the
Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.

water and the excess response found on the high frequency side of the Debye
peak. We find a lack of agreement on the microscopic phenomena underlying both
of these features. To better understand the molecular origin of Debye peak we
ran large scale molecular dynamics simulations and performed several different
distance-dependent decompositions of the low frequency dielectric spectra,
finding that it involves processes that take place on scales of 1.5-2.0 nm. We
also calculated the $k$-dependence of the Debye relaxation, finding it to be
highly dispersive. These findings are inconsistent with models that relate
Debye relaxation to local processes such as the rotation/translation of
molecules after H-bond breaking. We introduce the spectrumfitter Python package
for fitting dielectric spectra and analyze different ways of fitting the high
frequency excess, such as including one or two additional Debye peaks. We
propose using the generalized Lydanne-Sachs-Teller (gLST) equation as a way of
testing the physicality of model dielectric functions. Our attempts at fitting
the experimental spectrum using the gLST relation as a constraint indicate that
the traditional way of fitting the excess response with secondary and tertiary
Debye relaxations is problematic. All of our work is consistent with the recent
theory of Popov et al. (2016) that Debye relaxation is due to the migration of
Bjerrum-like defects in the hydrogen bond network. Under this theory, the
mechanism of Debye relaxation in liquid water is similar to the mechanism in
ice, but the heterogeneity and power-law dynamics of the H-bond network in
water results in excess response on the high frequency side of the peak.

that the other modes which can be moved can be shifted to any chosen location
with arbitrary precision. These results were developed for perfectly
decentralized, or block diagonal, information structure, where each control

  In this paper, we consider fixed modes for arbitrary information structures,
where certain control inputs may depend on some measurements but not others. We
provide a comprehensive proof that the modes which cannot be altered by a

  This shows that a system can be stabilized by a linear time-invariant
controller with the given information structure as long as all of the modes

algorithm for synthesizing such a stabilizing decentralized controller is then
distilled from the proof.

predominantly by the giant H II region Markarian 71 (Mrk 71). We compare the
system with GPs in terms of morphology, excitation properties, specific
star-formation rate, kinematics, absorption of low-ionization species,
reddening, and chemical abundance, and find consistencies throughout. Since
extreme GPs are associated with both candidate and confirmed Lyman continuum
(LyC) emitters, Mrk 71/NGC 2366 is thus also a good candidate for LyC escape.
The spatially resolved data for this object show a superbubble blowout
generated by mechanical feedback from one of its two super star clusters
(SSCs), Knot B, while the extreme ionization properties are driven by the <1
Myr-old, enshrouded SSC Knot A, which has ~ 10 times higher ionizing
luminosity. Very massive stars (> 100 Msun) may be present in this remarkable
object. Ionization-parameter mapping indicates the blowout region is optically
thin in the LyC, and the general properties also suggest LyC escape in the line
of sight. Mrk 71/NGC 2366 does differ from GPs in that it is 1 - 2 orders of
magnitude less luminous. The presence of this faint GP analog and candidate LyC
emitter (LCE) so close to us suggests that LCEs may be numerous and
commonplace, and therefore could significantly contribute to the cosmic
ionizing budget. Mrk 71/NGC 2366 offers an unprecedentedly detailed look at the
viscera of a candidate LCE, and could clarify the mechanisms of LyC escape.

$B_{\rm c}$ of electron Landau quantization. In more details, SLSN magnetars
can further be divided into two subclasses of magnetic fields of
$\sim(1-5)B_{\rm c}$ and $\sim(5-10)B_{\rm c}$, respectively. It is revealed
that these two subclasses of magnetars are just associated with the
slow-evolving and fast-evolving bolometric light curves of SLSNe. In
comparison, the magnetars harbored in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and associated
hypernovae are usually inferred to have much higher magnetic fields with a
lower boundary about $\sim10B_{\rm c}$. This robustly suggests that it is the
magnetic fields that play the crucial role in distinguishing SLSNe from

correlated with the masses of supernova ejecta, which provides a clue to
explore the nature of their progenitors. Moreover, the distribution of ejecta

to both derived complex analytic geometry and derived non-archimedean analytic

Unlike the Type IIn SN2010jl, which interacts with a dense wind for ~1yr, the
interaction ebbs after 2-3d, suggesting a dense and compact circumstellar
envelope. Here, we use multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics and
non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to explore the
properties of red supergiant (RSG) star explosions embedded in a variety of
dense envelopes. We consider the cases of an extended static atmosphere or a
steady-state wind, adopting a range of mass loss rates. The shock-breakout
signal, the SN radiation up to 10d, and the ejecta dynamics are strongly
influenced by the properties of this nearby environment. This compromises the
use of early-time observations to constrain Rstar. The presence of narrow lines
for 2-3d in 2013fs and 2013cu require a cocoon of material of ~0.01Msun out to
5-10Rstar. Spectral lines evolve from electron-scattering to Doppler broadened,
with a growing blueshift of their emission peaks. Recent studies propose a
super-wind phase with a mass loss rate from 0.001 up to 1Msun/yr in the last
months/years of the RSG life, although there is no observational constraint
that this external material is a steady-state outflow. Alternatively,
observations may be explained by the explosion of a RSG star inside its complex
atmosphere. Indeed, spatially resolved observations reveal that RSG stars have
extended atmospheres, with the presence of downflows and upflows out to several
Rstar, even in a standard RSG like Betelgeuse. Mass loading in the region
intermediate between star and wind can accommodate the 0.01Msun needed to
explain the observations of 2013fs. A puzzling super-wind phase prior to
core-collapse may be therefore superfluous [Abridged].

emission in this galaxy presumably originates from one of the three bright,
photoionizing knots known as A, B, and C. It is known that Knot C has strong
Ly$\alpha$ emission, and Knot B hosts an unusually bright ultraluminous X-ray
source, which may be a low-luminosity AGN. To clarify the LyC source, we carry
out ionization-parameter mapping (IPM) by obtaining narrow-band imaging from
the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS cameras to construct spatially resolved
ratio maps of [OIII]/[OII] emission from the galaxy. IPM traces the ionization
structure of the interstellar medium and allows us to identify optically thin
regions. To optimize the continuum subtraction, we introduce a new method for
determining the best continuum scale factor derived from the mode of the
continuum-subtracted, image flux distribution. We find no conclusive evidence
of LyC escape from Knots B or C, but instead, we identify a high-ionization
region extending over at least 1 kpc from Knot A. Knot A shows evidence of an
extremely young age ($\lesssim 1$ Myr), perhaps containing very massive stars
($>100$ M$_\odot$). It is weak in Ly$\alpha$, so if it is confirmed as the LyC

magnetically dead layers at the CoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface is necessary. In this

properties of CoFe2O4(111) layers with various thicknesses (thickness d = 1.4,
2.3, 4, and 11 nm) in the epitaxial CoFe2O4(111)/Al2O3(111)/Si(111) structures
using soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) combined with cluster-model calculation. The magnetization of
CoFe2O4 measured by XMCD gradually decreases with decreasing thickness d and
finally a magnetically dead layer is clearly detected at d = 1.4 nm. The
magnetically dead layer has frustration of magnetic interactions which is
revealed from comparison between the magnetizations at 300 and 6 K. From
analysis using configuration-interaction cluster-model calculation, the
decrease of d leads to a decrease in the inverse-to-normal spinel structure
ratio and also a decrease in the average valence of Fe at the octahedral sites.
These results strongly indicate that the magnetically dead layer at the
CoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface originates from various complex networks of
superexchange interactions through the change in the crystallographic and
electronic structures. Furthermore, from comparison of the magnetic properties
between d = 1.4 and 2.3 nm, it is found that ferrimagnetic order of the

provides a new way to test basic physics of the alignment of ultrasmall grains.
In this paper, we present a new model of polarized PAH emission that takes into
account the effect of PAH alignment with the magnetic field. We first generate
a large sample of the grain angular momentum $\bf J$ by simulating the
alignment of PAHs due to resonance paramagnetic relaxation that accounts for
various interaction processes. We then calculate the polarization level of PAH
emission features, for the different phases of the ISM, including the cold
neutral medium (CNM), reflection nebulae (RN), and photodissociation regions
(PDRs). We find that a moderate degree of PAH alignment can significantly
enhance the polarization degree of PAH emission compared to the previous
results obtained with randomly oriented $\bf J$. In particular, we find that
smallest, negatively charged PAHs in RN can be excited to slightly suprathermal
rotation due to enhanced ion collisional excitation, resulting in an increase
of the polarization with the ionization fraction. Our results suggest that RN
is the most favorable environment to observe polarized PAH emission and to test
alignment physics of nanoparticles. Finally, we present an explicit
relationship between the polarization level of PAH emission and the degree of
external alignment for the CNM and RN. The obtained relationship will be
particularly useful for testing alignment physics of PAHs by future
observations.

protected by time- reversal symmetry. However, even in the presence of magnetic

still exist, dubbed as pseudo quantum spin Hall effect. In this work, the
effects of the magnetic fields on the pseudo quantum spin Hall effect and the
phase transitions are studied. We show that an in-plane magnetic field drives a
pseudo quantum spin Hall state to metallic state at a high field. Moreover, at
a fixed in-plane magnetic field, an increasing out-of-plane magnetic field
leads to a reentrance of pseudo quantum spin Hall state in an inverted
InAs/GaSb quantum well. The edge state probability distribution and Chern
numbers are calculated to verify that the reentrant states are topologically
nontrivial. The origin of the reentrant behavior is attributed to the
nonmonotonic bending of Landau levels and the Landau level mixing caused by the
orbital effect induced by the in-plane magnetic field. The robustness to
disorder is demonstrated by the numerically calculated quantized conductance
for disordered nanowires within Landauer-B\""uttiker formalism.

unfavorable. In an attempt towards tackling this challenge, we propose a novel

hyperplane that separates this unknown yet useful feature from the rest.
Applying multiple instance learning in an SVM setup, we use the parameters of
this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the video. Since these
parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin
framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the CNN
features. We devise a joint optimization objective and an efficient solver that
learns these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers
over the hyperplanes. Showcased experiments on the standard HMDB and UCF101

resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we design a quadruplet loss,

was located near the $K2$ Campaign 9 field that was observed by a large number

number of these telescopes, and this enabled good coverage of the planetary
light curve signal. High angular resolution adaptive optics images from the

of the source star, as indicated by the light curve model. This excess flux
could be due to the lens star, but it could also be due to a companion to the

possibilities in a Bayesian analysis in the context of a standard Galactic

We determine the asymptotic number of such quartic $D_4$-fields ordered by

heuristics of Kedlaya and Wood. Additionally, we are able to impose any local
splitting conditions at any finite number of primes (sometimes, at an infinite

of order 4 elements in class groups and narrow class groups of quadratic fields

  Traditionally, there have been two approaches to counting quartic fields,
using arithmetic invariant theory in combination with geometry-of-number
techniques, and applying Kummer theory together with L-function methods. Both
of these strategies fall short in the case of $D_4$-fields ordered by conductor
since counting quartic fields containing a quadratic subfield with large
discriminant is difficult. However, when ordering by conductor, we utilize
additional algebraic structure arising from the outer automorphism of $D_4$
combined with both approaches mentioned above to obtain exact asymptotics.

the Boolean domain and characterized the computational complexity of such
problems. We investigate an algebraization of Schaefer's framework in which the
Fourier transform is used to represent constraints by multilinear polynomials
in a unique way. The polynomial representation of constraints gives rise to a
relaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables are
linear operators on some Hilbert space. For the case of constraints given by a
system of linear equations over the two-element field, this relaxation has
received considerable attention in the foundations of quantum mechanics, where
such constructions as the Mermin-Peres magic square show that there are systems
that have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operator
assignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain a complete
characterization of the classes of Boolean relations for which there is a gap
between satisfiability in the Boolean domain and the relaxation of
satisfiability via operator assignments. To establish our main result, we adapt
the notion of primitive-positive definability (pp-definability) to our setting,
a notion that has been used extensively in the study of constraint satisfaction
problems. Here, we show that pp-definability gives rise to gadget reductions
that preserve satisfiability gaps. We also present several additional
applications of this method. In particular and perhaps surprisingly, we show
that the relaxed notion of pp-definability in which the quantified variables
are allowed to range over operator assignments gives no additional expressive
power in defining Boolean relations.

range of Laponite (1.4 to 4 weight %) and salt concentrations (0 to 7 mM), the
system overwhelmingly demonstrates all the rheological characteristics of the
sol-gel transition leading to a percolated network. Analysis of the rheological
response leads to fractal dimension that primarily depends on the Laponite
concentration. We also obtain the activation energy for gelation, which is
observed to decrease with increase in Laponite as well as salt concentration.
Significantly, the cryo-TEM images of the post-gel state clearly show presence
of a percolated network formed by inter-particle bonds. The present work
therefore conclusively establishes the system to be in an attractive gel state
resolving a long-standing debate in the literature.

belonging to the same basic-level category, such as 200 subcategories belonging
to the bird, which is highly challenging due to large variance in the same
subcategory and small variance among different subcategories. Existing methods
generally first locate the objects or parts and then discriminate which
subcategory the image belongs to. However, they mainly have two limitations:
(1) Relying on object or part annotations which are heavily labor consuming.
(2) Ignoring the spatial relationships between the object and its parts as well
as among these parts, both of which are significantly helpful for finding
discriminative parts. Therefore, this paper proposes the object-part attention
model (OPAM) for weakly supervised fine-grained image classification, and the
main novelties are: (1) Object-part attention model integrates two level
attentions: object-level attention localizes objects of images, and part-level
attention selects discriminative parts of object. Both are jointly employed to
learn multi-view and multi-scale features to enhance their mutual promotions.
(2) Object-part spatial constraint model combines two spatial constraints:
object spatial constraint ensures selected parts highly representative, and
part spatial constraint eliminates redundancy and enhances discrimination of
selected parts. Both are jointly employed to exploit the subtle and local
differences for distinguishing the subcategories. Importantly, neither object
nor part annotations are used in our proposed approach, which avoids the heavy
labor consumption of labeling. Comparing with more than 10 state-of-the-art
methods on 4 widely-used datasets, our OPAM approach achieves the best

Methods for automatically increasing image memorability would have an impact in
many application fields like education, gaming or advertising. Our work is
inspired by the popular editing-by-applying-filters paradigm adopted in photo
editing applications, like Instagram and Prisma. In this context, the problem
of increasing image memorability maps to that of retrieving ""memorabilizing""
filters or style ""seeds"". Still, users generally have to go through most of the

process into a resource and time consuming task. In this work, we show that it

thus remarkably reducing the number of human attempts needed to find a good
match. Our approach leverages from recent advances in the field of image
synthesis and adopts a deep architecture for generating a memorable picture
from a given input image and a style seed. Importantly, to automatically select
the best style a novel learning-based solution, also relying on deep models, is
proposed. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on publicly available

holds true for a closed physical system consisting of pure antimatter in the
thermodynamical limit, but in a reversed form. We give two plausible arguments
in favour to this proposal: one refers to the CPT theorem of relativistic
quantum field theories while the other one is based on general thermodynamical
arguments. However in our understanding the ultimate validity or invalidity of
this idea can be decided only by future physical experiments.
  As a consequence of the proposal we argue that the dynamical evolution of
pure macroscopic antimatter systems can be very different from that of ordinary
matter systems in the sense that sufficiently massive antimatter systems could
have stronger tendency to form black holes during time evolution than their
ordinary counterparts. Taking into account the various uniqueness theorems in
black hole physics as well, as a result, antimatter could tracelessly disappear
behind black hole event horizons faster in time than ordinary matter. The
observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter could then be explained even if
their presence in the Universe was symmetric in the beginning.

imposed by the steady growth of cells have recently been discussed both
experimentally and theoretically. By assuming a small environmental
perturbation and considering a linear response to it, a common proportionality
in such expression changes was derived and partially verified by experimental
data. Here, we examined global protein expression in ${\it Escherichia coli}$
under various environmental perturbations. Remarkably they are proportional
across components, even though these environmental changes are not small and
cover different types of stresses, while the proportion coefficient corresponds
to the change in growth rate. However, since such global proportionality is not
generic to all systems under a condition of steady growth, a new conceptual
framework is needed. We hypothesized that such proportionality is a result of
evolution. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed a cell model with a huge
number of components that reproduces itself via a catalytic reaction network,
and confirmed that the common proportionality in the concentrations of all
components is shaped through evolutionary processes to maximize cell growth
(and therefore fitness) under a given environmental condition. Further, we
found that the concentration changes across all components in response to
environmental and evolutionary changes are constrained along a one-dimensional
major axis within a huge-dimensional state space. Based on these observations,
we propose a theory in which high-dimensional phenotypic changes after
evolution are constrained along a one-dimensional major axis that correlates
with the growth rate, which can explain broad experimental and numerical
results.

compounds were calculated using first-principles density functional theory. To
begin with, Cu$_2$MnAl is used as a case study to explain the interpretation of
the basic quantities and compare them with experiments. The main part of the
work focuses on Co$_2$-based compounds that are Co$_2$Mn$M$ with the main group
elements $M=$~Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, and Co$_2TM$ with the main
group elements Si or Ge, and the $3d$ transition metals $T=$~Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
and Fe. It is found that many properties of Heusler compounds correlate to the
mass or nuclear charge $Z$ of the main group element.
  Blackman's and Every's diagrams are used to compare the elastic properties of
the materials, whereas Pugh's and Poisson's ratios are used to analyze the
relationship between interatomic bonding and physical properties. It is found
that the {\it Pugh's criterion} on brittleness needs to be revised whereas {\it
Christensen's criterion} describes the ductile--brittle transition of Heusler
compounds very well. The calculated elastic properties give hint on a metallic
bonding with an intermediate brittleness for the studied Heusler compounds.
  The universal anisotropy of the stable compounds has values in the range of
$0.57 <A_U <2.73$. The compounds with higher $A_U$ values are found close to
the middle of the transition metal series. In particular, Co$_2$ScAl with
$A_U=0.01$ is predicted to be an isotropic material that comes closest to an
ideal Cauchy solid as compared to the remaining Co$_2$-based compounds. Apart
from the elastic constants and moduli, the sound velocities, Debye
temperatures, and hardness are predicted and discussed for the studied systems.
The calculated slowness surfaces for sound waves reflect the degree of
anisotropy of the compounds.

radiopure $^{100}$Mo-containing zinc and lithium molybdate crystals have been
produced and used to develop high performance single detector modules based on
0.2--0.4~kg scintillating bolometers. In particular, the energy resolution of
the lithium molybdate detectors near the $Q$-value of the double-beta
transition of $^{100}$Mo (3034~keV) is 4--6~keV FWHM. The rejection of the
$\alpha$-induced dominant background above 2.6~MeV is better than 8$\sigma$.
Less than 10~$\mu$Bq/kg activity of $^{232}$Th ($^{228}$Th) and $^{226}$Ra in

as security sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and
information flows in conjunction with Machine Learning classifiers to achieve
accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic
perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and
limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks
but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the
existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the
aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority
of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified
framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing
comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale
is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in
every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.
  MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information
from apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view.
Subsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted
combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides
multi-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to
locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g.,
methods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets
(incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three
state-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while
maintaining comparable efficiency. In our malicious code localisation
experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware, MKLDroid was able to identify
all the malice classes with 94% average recall.

the formulation of different reduced models, where electron inertia terms are
discarded while retaining some or all kinetic effects. Upon considering general
full-orbit particle trajectories, this paper compares the dispersion relations
emerging from such models in the case of the Weibel instability. As a result,
the question of how lengthscales below the electron skin depth can be neglected
in a kinetic treatment emerges as an unsolved problem, since all current
theories suffer from drawbacks of different nature. Alternatively, we discuss
fully kinetic theories that remove all these drawbacks by restricting to
frequencies well below the plasma frequency of both ions and electrons. By
giving up on the lengthscale restrictions appearing in previous works, these
models are obtained by assuming quasi-neutrality in the full Maxwell-Vlasov

problem that is difficult to solve in general. We thus propose an efficient
iterative algorithm by applying the block coordinate descent and successive
convex optimization techniques, which is guaranteed to converge to at least a
locally optimal solution. To achieve fast convergence and stable throughput, we
further propose a low-complexity initialization scheme for the UAV trajectory
design based on the simple circular trajectory. Extensive simulation results
are provided which show significant throughput gains of the proposed design as
compared to other benchmark schemes.

argon clusters on the chemical and electronic properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
(LAO/STO) heterointerfaces by combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
and electrical transport measurements. Due to its unique features, we show that
a short-time cluster ion irradiation of the LAO surface induces indirect
modifications in the chemical properties of the buried STO substrate, with (1)
a lowering of Ti atoms oxidation states (from Ti4+ to Ti3+ and Ti2+) correlated
to the formation of oxygen vacancies at the LAO surface and (2) the creation of
new surface states for Sr atoms. Contrary to what is observed by using higher
energy ion beam techniques, this leads to an increase of the electrical
conductivity at the LAO/STO interface. Our XPS data clearly reveal the
existence of dynamical processes on the titanium and strontium atoms, which
compete with the effect of the cluster ion beam irradiation. These relaxation
effects are in part attributed to the diffusion of the ion-induced oxygen
vacancies in the entire heterostructure, since an increase of the interfacial
metallicity is also evidenced far from the irradiated area. These results
demonstrate that a local perturbation of the LAO surface can induce new
properties at the interface and in the entire heterostructure. This study
highlights the possibility of tuning the electronic properties of LAO/STO
interfaces by surface engineering, confirming experimentally the intimate
connection between LAO surface chemistry and electronic properties of LAO/STO

case in the disordered phase, a first derivative of the chemical potential (or
the density) with respect to a magnetic field does not vanish in a magnetically
ordered phase when the field is applied parallel to the magnetic moment. This
effect is crucial and should be included when computing magnetic susceptibility
in the ordered phase, otherwise an unphysical result would be obtained. In
addition, consequently the magnetic susceptibility becomes different when
computed at a fixed density and a fixed chemical potential in the ordered

chemical potential to describe a system with a fixed density even if the
chemical potential is tuned to reproduce the correct density.

evolution in a galaxy using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations

grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering.
The dust species are separated into carbonaceous dust and silicate. The
evolution of grain size distribution is considered by dividing grain population
into large and small gains, which allows us to estimate extinction curves. We
examine the dependence of extinction curves on the position, gas density, and
metallicity in the galaxy, and find that extinction curves are flat at $t
\lesssim 0.3$ Gyr because stellar dust production dominates the total dust
abundance. The 2175 \AA\ bump and far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise become prominent
after dust growth by accretion. At $t \gtrsim 3$ Gyr, shattering works
efficiently in the outer disc and low density regions, so extinction curves
show a very strong 2175 \AA\ bump and steep FUV rise. The extinction curves at
$t\gtrsim 3$ Gyr are consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve, which
implies that we successfully included the necessary dust processes in the
model. The outer disc component caused by stellar feedback has an extinction
curves with a weaker 2175 \AA\ bump and flatter FUV slope. The strong
contribution of carbonaceous dust tends to underproduce the FUV rise in the
Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve, which supports selective loss of small
carbonaceous dust in the galaxy. The snapshot at young ages also explain the
extinction curves in high-redshift quasars.

the only pPN with previous published detections of H41a, H35a, and H30a

current observations are probing regions of the ionized wind with larger
expansion velocities and mass-loss rate than ~29 years ago. In the case of MWC
922, we observe a drastic transition from single-peaked profiles at 3mm to
double-peaked profiles at 1mm, which is consistent with maser amplification of
the highest frequency lines; the observed line profiles are compatible with
rotation and expansion of the ionized gas, probably arranged in a disk+wind
system around a ~5-10 Msun central mass. In M 2-9, the mm-RRL emission appears
to be tracing a recent mass outburst by one of the stars of the central binary
system. We present the results from non-LTE line and continuum radiative
transfer models, which enables us to constrain the structure, kinematics, and
physical conditions (electron temperature and density) of the ionized cores of

explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe, we exploit two metrics to
describe the late time Universe. Since the standard FLRW metric cannot
precisely describe the late time Universe on small scales, the template metric
with an evolving curvature parameter $\kappa_{\mathcal{D}}(t)$ is employed.
However, we doubt the validity of the prescription for $\kappa_{\mathcal{D}}$,
which motivates us apply observational Hubble parameter data (OHD) to constrain
parameters in dust cosmology. First, for FLRW metric, by getting best-fit
constraints of $\Omega^{{\mathcal{D}}_0}_m = 0.25^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$, $n =
0.02^{+0.69}_{-0.66}$, and $H_{\mathcal{D}_0} = 70.54^{+4.24}_{-3.97}\ {\rm km

template metric context, by marginalizing over $H_{\mathcal{D}_0}$ as a prior
of uniform distribution, we obtain the best-fit values of
$n=-1.22^{+0.68}_{-0.41}$ and
${{\Omega}_{m}^{\mathcal{D}_{0}}}=0.12^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$. Moreover, we utilize
three different Gaussian priors of $H_{\mathcal{D}_0}$, which result in
different best-fits of $n$, but almost the same best-fit value of
${{\Omega}_{m}^{\mathcal{D}_{0}}}\sim0.12$. Also, the absolute constraints
without marginalization of parameter are obtained: $n=-1.1^{+0.58}_{-0.50}$ and
${{\Omega}_{m}^{\mathcal{D}_{0}}}=0.13\pm0.03$. With these constraints, the
evolutions of the effective deceleration parameter $q^{\mathcal{D}}$ indicate
that the backreaction can account for the accelerated expansion of the Universe
without involving extra dark energy component in the scaling solution context.
Nevertheless, the results also verify that the prescription of
$\kappa_{\mathcal{D}}$ is insufficient and should be improved.

assigned to histories subject to a consistency condition of negligible
interference. The approach has the feature that a given physical situation
admits multiple sets of consistent histories that cannot in general be united
into a single consistent set, leading to a number of counter-intuitive or
contrary properties if propositions from different consistent sets are combined
indiscriminately. An alternative viewpoint is proposed in which multiple
consistent sets are classified according to whether or not there exists any
unifying probability for combinations of incompatible sets which replicates the
consistent histories result when restricted to a single consistent set. A
number of examples are exhibited in which this classification can be made, in
some cases with the assistance of the Bell, CHSH or Leggett-Garg inequalities
together with Fine's theorem. When a unifying probability exists logical
deductions in different consistent sets can in fact be combined, an extension
of the ""single framework rule"". It is argued that this classification coincides
with intuitive notions of the boundary between classical and quantum regimes
and in particular, the absence of a unifying probability for certain
combinations of consistent sets is regarded as a measure of the ""quantumness""
of the system. The proposed approach and results are closely related to recent
work on the classification of quasi-probabilities and this connection is
discussed.

planets with stellar mass. Such surveys rely on evolved stars for a sample of
intermediate-mass stars (so-called retired A stars), which are more amenable to
Doppler observations than their main-sequence progenitors. However, it has been
hypothesised that the masses of subgiant and low-luminosity red-giant stars
targeted by these surveys --- typically derived from a combination of
spectroscopy and isochrone fitting --- may be systematically overestimated.
Here, we test this hypothesis for the particular case of the exoplanet-host
star HD 212771 using K2 asteroseismology. The benchmark asteroseismic mass
($1.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\:\text{M}_{\odot}$) is significantly higher than the
value reported in the discovery paper ($1.15\pm0.08\:\text{M}_{\odot}$), which
has been used to inform the stellar mass-planet occurrence relation. This
result, therefore, does not lend support to the above hypothesis. Implications
for the fates of planetary systems are sensitively dependent on stellar mass.
Based on the derived asteroseismic mass, we predict the post-main-sequence
evolution of the Jovian planet orbiting HD 212771 under the effects of tidal

We find significant correlations between structure and transport efficiency:
High-performing structures tend to be more compact and, among those, the best
structures display a certain orientation of the chromophores, particularly the

reasonable, physically-motivated constraints, the FMO complex is highly attuned
to the purpose of energy transport, partly by exploiting these structural

occur in string derived models, and relatively light moduli are helpful for
obtaining viable phenomenology. We also study the effects of hidden sector
gluinos. In some parts of parameter space these can be the dominant dark matter

covering the whole band 6 (from 211 to 275 GHz). In order to determine the
continuum emission in line-rich sources, we use a new statistical method:
STATCONT. We detect 27 continuum sources in SgrB2(M) and 20 in SgrB2(N). We
study the continuum emission across the ALMA band 6, and compare it with
previous SMA 345 GHz and VLA 40 GHz observations, to study the nature of the
sources detected. The brightest sources are dominated by (partially optically
thick) dust emission, while there is an important degree of contamination from
ionized gas free-free emission in weaker sources. While the total mass in
SgrB2(M) is distributed in many fragments, most of the mass in SgrB2(N) arises
from a single object, with filamentary-like structures converging towards the
center. There seems to be a lack of low-mass dense cores in both regions. We
determine H2 volume densities for the cores of about 10^5-10^7 Msun pc^-3, one
to two orders of magnitude higher than the stellar densities of super star
clusters. In general, SgrB2(N) is chemically richer than SgrB2(M). There seems
to be a correlation between the chemical richness and the mass of the
fragments, with more massive clumps being more chemically rich. Both SgrB2(N)
and SgrB2(M) harbour a cluster of hot molecular cores. We compare the continuum
images with predictions from a detailed 3D radiative transfer model that
reproduces the structure of SgrB2 from 45 pc down to 100 au. This dataset,

simulations of laser cooling of the $^{12}$C$^{3+}$ ion beams by scanning the

performed. The simulation results indicated that a large momentum spread ion
beams could be laser-cooled by the combination of only one CW laser and the

The optimized parameters for scanning the RF-buncher frequency or laser

laser cooling at the CSRe. The Schottky noise spectra of longitudinally
modulated and laser-cooled ion beams was simulated to fully explain and
anticipate the experimental results. The combination of Schottky spectra from

the framework of the electron quantum optics. Excitations are then studied
through heat and mixed noise generated by the random partitioning at the
barrier. It is shown that levitons, the single-particle excitations of a filled
Fermi sea recently observed in experiments, represent the cleanest states for
heat transport, since excess heat and mixed shot noise both vanish only when
Lorentzian voltage pulses carrying integer electric charge are applied to the
conductor. This happens in the integer quantum Hall regime and for Laughlin
fractional states as well, with no influence of fractional physics on the
conditions for clean energy pulses. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness
of such excitations to the overlap of Lorentzian wavepackets. Even though mixed
and heat noise have nonlinear dependence on the voltage bias, and despite the
non-integer power-law behavior arising from the fractional quantum Hall
physics, an arbitrary superposition of levitons always generates minimal
excitation states.

images with resolved features onto one another and that is based on a
Taylor-expanded lensing potential close to a point on the critical curve within
our model-independent lens characterisation approach. From T, the same
information about the critical curve at fold and cusp points is derived as
determined by the quadrupole moment of the individual images as observables. In
addition, we read off the relative parities between the images, so that the
parity of all images is determined, when one is known. We compare all
retrievable ratios of potential derivatives to the actual ones and to those
obtained by using the quadrupole moment as observable for two and three image
configurations generated by a galaxy-cluster scale singular isothermal ellipse.
We conclude that using the quadrupole moments as observables, the properties of
the critical curve at the cusp points are retrieved to higher accuracy, at the
fold points to lower accuracy, and the ratios of second order potential
derivatives to comparable accuracy. We show that the approach using ratios of
convergences and reduced shear is equivalent to ours close to the critical
curve but yields more accurate results and is more robust because it does not
require a special coordinate system like the approach using potential
derivatives. T is determined by mapping manually assigned reference points in
the images onto each other. If the assignment of reference points is subject to
measurement uncertainties under noise, we find that the confidence intervals of
the lens parameters can be as large as the values, when the uncertainties are
larger than one pixel. Observed multiple images with resolved features are more
extended than unresolved ones, so that higher order moments should be taken
into account to improve the reconstruction.

demonstrate that all the moments of the FPT obey universal scalings with the

the high cost of acquisition, the data are usually sparse, and always contain

of these data are their often unbalanced nature: i.e, there is often systematic
variation between groups simply due to presence or absence of features, and
this variation is important to the biological interpretation of the data. A
simple example would be comparing transcriptomes of yeast cells with and

exhibit widely varying centres. This work extends a previously described

charged particles we need their velocities and positions as a function of the
lab frame time t. The relativistic motion of a particle in the lab frame is
described by Newton's second law corrected for the relativistic dependence of
the particle momentum on the velocity. In all standard derivations the
trajectories in the source part of the usual Maxwell's equations are identified
with the trajectories $\vec{x}(t)$ calculated by using the ""corrected"" Newton's
second law. This way of coupling fields and particles is considered correct. We
argue that this procedure needs to be changed by demonstrating a
counterintuitive: the results of conventional theory of radiation by
relativistically moving charges are not consistent with the principle of
relativity. The trajectory of a particle in the lab frame consistent with the
usual Maxwell's equations, is found by solving the dynamics equation in
manifestly covariant form, with the proper time $\tau$ used to parameterize the
particle world-line in space-time. We find a difference between the ""true""

way, and the covariant particle trajectory $\vec{x}_{cov}(t)$ calculated by
projecting the world-line to the lab frame and using t to parameterize the

$\vec{x}_{cov}(t)$ is consistent with the usual Maxwell's equations: therefore,
a correction of the conventional synchrotron-cyclotron radiation theory is

analytic equations of the locations of the shadow features as a function of the

In contrast to previous claims in the literature, we show that the position
angle of the line connecting the shadows cannot be directly related to the
position angle of the inner disk. We show how the analytic framework derived

estimates of the outer disk height to put constraints on the inner disk

that for the disk surrounding HD100453 the analytic estimates and
interferometric observations result in a consistent picture of the orientation

value varies depending on the orbital phase of the planet. This polarization
signal is either caused by the stellar occultation or by reflected starlight
from the surface of the orbiting planet. When the CGP system is located in the
Galactic bulge, its polarization signal becomes too weak to be measured
directly. One method for detecting and characterizing these weak polarization
signatures due to distant CGP systems is gravitational microlensing. In this
work, we focus on potential polarimetric observations of highly-magnified
microlensing events of CGP systems. When the lens is passing directly in front
of the source star with its planetary companion, the polarimetric signature
caused by the transiting planet is magnified. As a result some distinct
features in the polarimetry and light curves are produced. In the same way
microlensing amplifies the reflection-induced polarization signal. While the
planet-induced perturbations are magnified, whenever these polarimetric or
photometric deviations vanish for a moment the corresponding magnification
factor or the polarization component(s) is equal to the related one due to the
planet itself. In order to evaluate the observability of such systems through
polarimetric or photometric observations of high-magnification microlensing
events, we simulate these events by considering confirmed CGP systems as their
source stars and conclude that the efficiency for detecting the planet-induced
signal with the state-of-the-art polarimetric instrument (FORS2/VLT) is less
than 0.1 %. Consequently, these planet-induced polarimetry perturbations can
likely be detected under favorable conditions by high-resolution and
short-cadence polarimeters of the next generation.

and the measured data often includes noise, so state and parameter estimators
are needed to perform inference and further analysis using the system state
path. The distributions of SDEs which are nonlinear or subject to non-Gaussian
measurement noise do not admit tractable analytic expressions, so state and
parameter estimators for these systems are often approximations based on
heuristics, such as the extended and unscented Kalman smoothers, or the
prediction error method using nonlinear Kalman filters. However, the Onsager
Machlup functional can be used to obtain fictitious densities for the
parameters and state-paths of SDEs with analytic expressions. In this thesis,
we provide a unified theoretical framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation of general random variables, possibly infinite-dimensional, and show
how the Onsager--Machlup functional can be used to construct the joint MAP
state-path and parameter estimator for SDEs. We also prove that the minimum
energy estimator, which is often thought to be the MAP state-path estimator,
actually gives the state paths associated to the MAP noise paths. Furthermore,
we prove that the discretized MAP state-path and parameter estimators, which
have emerged recently as powerful alternatives to nonlinear Kalman smoothers,
converge hypographically as the discretization step vanishes. Their
hypographical limit, however, is the MAP estimator for SDEs when the
trapezoidal discretization is used and the minimum energy estimator when the
Euler discretization is used, associating different interpretations to each
discretized estimate.

Semantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications
in which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System
and crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the
digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people
about events they want to share with others typically participating in their
social networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance
of sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize
semantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a
crowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be
marked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept
from a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps
start to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the
meaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of
linked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to
perform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that
constitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the
map. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was
applied in a crowd map authoring tool.

energy storage devices in coordination with the power generators to maintain
the power balance between distributed resources and load devices. In order to
support the generators by using energy storage systems, an energy management
scheme must be deployed to ensure load demand is met. This paper proposes and
implements an energy management scheme based on model predictive control to
optimize the coordination between the energy storage and the power generators

extension of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which takes into
account the dynamic nature of the problem. This aspect requires the vehicle
routes to be updated in an ongoing manner as new customer requests arrive in
the system and must be incorporated into an evolving schedule during the
working day. Besides the vehicle capacity constraint involved in the classical
VRP, DVRPTW considers in addition time windows, which are able to better
capture real-world situations. Despite this, so far, few studies have focused
on tackling this problem of greater practical importance. To this end, this
study devises for the resolution of DVRPTW, an ant colony optimization based
algorithm, which resorts to a joint solution construction mechanism, able to
construct in parallel the vehicle routes. This method is coupled with a local
search procedure, aimed to further improve the solutions built by ants, and
with an insertion heuristics, which tries to reduce the number of vehicles used
to service the available customers. The experiments indicate that the proposed

(SSAC), where the learner is allowed to make adaptive queries to a domain
expert. The queries are of the kind ""do two given points belong to the same
optimal cluster?"" There are many clustering contexts where such same-cluster
queries are feasible. Ashtiani et al. exhibited the power of such queries by
showing that any instance of the $k$-means clustering problem, with additional
margin assumption, can be solved efficiently if one is allowed $O(k^2 \log{k} +
k \log{n})$ same-cluster queries. This is interesting since the $k$-means
problem, even with the margin assumption, is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard.
  In this paper, we extend the work of Ashtiani et al. to the approximation
setting showing that a few of such same-cluster queries enables one to get a
polynomial-time $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-means
problem without any margin assumption on the input dataset. Again, this is
interesting since the $k$-means problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to approximate
within a factor $(1 + c)$ for a fixed constant $0 < c < 1$. The number of
same-cluster queries used is $\textrm{poly}(k/\varepsilon)$ which is
independent of the size $n$ of the dataset. Our algorithm is based on the
$D^2$-sampling technique. We also give a conditional lower bound on the number
of same-cluster queries showing that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)
holds, then any such efficient query algorithm needs to make $\Omega
\left(\frac{k}{poly \log k} \right)$ same-cluster queries. Our algorithm can be
extended for the case when the oracle is faulty. Another result we show with
respect to the $k$-means++ seeding algorithm is that a small modification to
the $k$-means++ seeding algorithm within the SSAC framework converts it to a
constant factor approximation algorithm instead of the well known
$O(\log{k})$-approximation algorithm.

studied research topic. The instrumental variable (IV) and local causal
discovery (LCD) patterns are canonical examples of settings where a closed-form
expression exists for the causal effect of one variable on another, given the
presence of a third variable. Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the
latter only influences the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it
is likely that this assumption only holds approximately and that there will be
at least some form of weak interaction. This brings about the paradoxical
situation that, in the large-sample limit, no predictions are made, as
detecting the weak edge invalidates the setting. We introduce an alternative
approach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects the
existence of many 'weak' (irrelevant) and 'strong' interactions. We obtain a
posterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows
that, in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the
approach in an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the
MultiNest sampling algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to
show our method is robust even when strict faithfulness is violated.

of higher-dimensional operators leading to an effective theory. The
introduction of these operators makes the theory nonrenormalizable, and one may
reasonably expect a violation of unitarity in $2\to 2$ scattering
processes,depending on the values of the Wilson coefficients of the higher
dimensional operators. Bounds on these coefficients may be obtained from
demanding that there be no such unitarity violation below the scale of the
effective theory. We show, at the lowest level, how the new operators affect
the scattering amplitudes with longitudinal gauge bosons, scalars, and
$t\bar{t}$ in the final state, and find that one may expect a violation of
unitarity even at the LHC energies with small values of some of the new Wilson
coefficients. For most of the others, such a violation needs large
coefficients, indicating nonperturbative physics for the ultraviolet-complete
theory, although a proper treatment necessitates the inclusion of even
higher-dimensional operators. However, deviations from the Standard Model
expectations may be observed with even smaller values for these coefficients.
We find that $WW \to WW$, $WW\to ZZ$, and $ZZ\to hh$ scatterings are the best
possible channels to probe unitarity violations.

scattering method to find eigenstates of spin-1/2 XXX Gaudin magnets in an

natural approach which would be to simply orient the spin quantisation axis in
the same direction as the magnetic field through an appropriate rotation.
Instead, we define a modified realisation of the rational Gaudin algebra and
use the quantum inverse scattering method which allows us, within a slightly
modified implementation, to build an algebraic Bethe ansatz using the same
unrotated reference state (pseudovacuum) for any external field. This common
framework allows us to easily write determinant expressions for certain scalar
products which would be highly non-trivial in the rotated system approach.

face alignment and have shown potential for learning improved feature
representations. Although deeper layers can capture abstract concepts like
pose, it is difficult to capture the geometric relationships among the
keypoints in DCNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution-deconvolution
network for facial keypoint detection. Our model predicts the 2D locations of
the keypoints and their individual visibility along with 3D head pose, while
exploiting the spatial relationships among different keypoints. Different from
existing approaches of modeling these relationships, we propose learnable
transform functions which captures the relationships between keypoints at
feature level. However, due to extensive variations in pose, not all of these
relationships act at once, and hence we propose, a pose-based routing function
which implicitly models the active relationships. Both transform functions and
the routing function are implemented through convolutions in a multi-task
framework. Our approach presents a single-shot keypoint detection method,
making it different from many existing cascade regression-based methods. We
also show that learning these relationships significantly improve the accuracy
of keypoint detections for in-the-wild face images from challenging datasets
such as AFW and AFLW.

with an average speed-up of factor 3 for the standard networks considered here.
If generation capacities are also optimized, the average speed-up rises to a
factor of 12, reaching up to factor 213 in a particular instance. The speed-up
is largest for networks with many buses and decentral generators throughout the

field of the form $B_z\approx(1 + \cos(2\pi z/z_0))/2$ is externally imposed,
where the wavelength $z_0=50(r_o-r_i)$. Taylor vortices form where the field is
weak, but not where it is strong. As the Reynolds number measuring the rotation
rate is increased, the initial onset of vortices involves phase slip events,
whereby pairs of Taylor vortices are periodically formed and then drift
outward, away from the midplane where $B_z=0$. Subsequent bifurcations lead to
a variety of other solutions, including ones both symmetric and asymmetric
about the midplane. For even larger Reynolds numbers a different type of phase
slip arises, in which vortices form at the outer edges of the pattern and drift
inward, disappearing abruptly at a certain point. These solutions can also be
symmetric or asymmetric about the midplane, and co-exist at the same Reynolds
number. Many of the dynamics of these phase slip solutions are qualitatively
similar to previous results in geometrically ramped Taylor-Couette flows.

transmission eigenfunctions arising in wave scattering theory. We numerically
show that the aforementioned geometric structure can be much delicate and
intriguing. The major findings can be roughly summarized as follows. If there
is a cusp on the support of the underlying potential function, then the
interior transmission eigenfunction vanishes near the cusp if its interior
angle is less than $\pi$, whereas the interior transmission eigenfunction
localizes near the cusp if its interior angle is bigger than $\pi$.
Furthermore, we show that the vanishing and blowup orders are inversely
proportional to the interior angle of the cusp: the sharper the angle, the
higher the convergence order. Our results are first of its type in the spectral
theory for transmission eigenvalue problems, and the existing studies in the
literature concentrate more on the intrinsic properties of the transmission
eigenvalues instead of the transmission eigenfunctions. Due to the limitedness
of the computing resources, our study is by no means exclusive and complete. We
consider our study only in a certain geometric setup including corner, curved
corner and edge singularities. Nevertheless, we believe that similar results
hold for more general cusp singularities and rigorous theoretical
justifications are much desirable. Our study enriches the spectral theory for
transmission eigenvalue problems. We also discuss its implication to inverse
scattering theory.

item recommendation. It is easy to collect and is domain independent. However,
there is a lack of negative examples. Previous work tackles this problem by
assuming that users are not interested or not as much interested in the
unconsumed items. Those assumptions are often severely violated since
non-consumption can be due to factors like unawareness or lack of resources.
Therefore, non-consumption by a user does not always mean disinterest or
irrelevance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Conformative
Filtering (CoF) to address the issue. The motivating observation is that if
there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them have
consumed an item before, then it is likely that the item is not of interest to
the group. We perform multidimensional clustering on implicit feedback data
using hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA) to identify user `tastes' groups
and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups and
on the past behavior of the groups. Experiments on two real-world datasets from
different domains show that CoF has superior performance compared to several

numerically treat such problems is to simplify the coefficient by some
approximation, say $A_{\varepsilon}$, and to use standard finite elements. In
\cite{Repin2012} a combined modelling-discretization strategy has been proposed
which estimates the discretization and modelling errors by a posteriori
estimates of functional type. This strategy allows to balance these two errors
in a problem adapted way. However, the estimate of the modelling error is
derived under the assumption that the difference $A_{\scriptscriptstyle 0}
-A_{\varepsilon}$ is bounded in the $L^{\infty}$-norm, which requires that the
approximation of the coefficient matches the discontinuities of the original
coefficient. Therefore this theory is not appropriate for applications with
discontinuous coefficients along \textit{complicated, curved} interfaces. Based
on bounds for $A_{\scriptscriptstyle 0} -A_{\varepsilon}$ in an $L^{q}$-norm
with $q<\infty$ we generalize the combined modelling-discretization strategy to
a larger class of coefficients.

  We show that computing $\omega(G)$ and $\chi(G)$ for disjointness graphs of

to compute proper colorings of $G$ in which the number of colors satisfies the

the CMB due to milli-charged fermion vacuum polarization. Analytic expressions
for the degree of circular polarization and rotation angle of polarization

Relativity, there is one more polarization state which is the mixture of the
transverse breathing and longitudinal polarizations.The additional mode is
excited by the massive scalar field. In the massless limit, the longitudinal
polarization disappears, while the breathing one persists. The upper bound on
the graviton mass severely constrains the amplitude of the longitudinal
polarization, which makes its detection highly unlikely by the ground-based or

might be able to detect the polarization excited by the massive scalar field.
Since additional polarization states appear in alternative theories of gravity,
the measurement of the polarizations of gravitational waves can be used to
probe the nature of gravity. In addition to the plus and cross states, the
detection of the breathing polarization means that gravitation is mediated by
massless spin 2 and spin 0 fields, and the detection of both the breathing and

into the central star is a long-studied topic. It is well known that outward
migration is possible in viscous-heated discs relatively close to the central
star because the entropy gradient can be sufficiently steep that the positive
corotation torque overcomes the negative Lindblad torque. Yet efficiently
trapping planets in this region remains elusive. Here we study disc conditions
that yield outward migration for low-mass planets under specific planet
migration prescriptions. Using a steady-state disc model with a constant
alpha-viscosity, outward migration is only possible when the negative
temperature gradient exceeds ~0.87. We derive an implicit relation for the
maximum mass at which outward migration is possible as a function of viscosity
and disc scale height. We apply these criteria, using a simple power-law disc
model, to planets that have reached their pebble isolation mass after an
episode of rapid accretion. It is possible to trap planets with the pebble
isolation mass farther than the inner edge of the disc provided that alpha_crit
>~ 0.004 for discs older than 1 Myr. In very young discs the high temperature
causes the planets to grow to masses exceeding the maximum for outward
migration. As the disc evolves, these more massive planets often reach the
central star, generally only towards the end of the disc's lifetime. Saving
super-Earths is therefore a delicate interplay between disc viscosity, the
opacity profile and the temperature gradient in the viscously heated inner
disc.

Drullion (2014) (SHD14) is solved numerically for atmospheric turbulent shear
fows blowing over unsteady Stokes water waves, of low to moderate steepness. It
is demonstrated that as the wave steepens further the inner layer exceeds the
critical layer and beneath the cat's-eye there is a strong reverse flow which
will then affect the surface drag, but at the surface the flow adjusts itself
to the orbital velocity of the wave. We show that in the limit as c_r=U_* is
very small, namely slow moving waves the energy-transfer rate to the waves,
\beta, computed here using an eddy-viscosity model, agrees with the asymptotic
steady state analysis of Belcher and Hunt (1993) and the earlier model of
Townsend (1980). Computations for the cases when the waves are traveling faster
and growing significantly show a critical shear layer forms outside the inner
surface shear layer for steeper waves. We show that the critical layer produces
a significant but not the dominant effect; a weak lee-side jet is formed by the
inertial dynamics in the critical layer, which adds to the drag produced by the
sheltering effect. Over peaked waves, the inner layer flow on the lee-side
tends to slow and separate, which over a growing fast wave defects the
streamlines and the critical layer upwards on the lee side. Hence, it is
proposed, using an earlier study SHD14, that the mechanisms identified here for
wave-induced motion contributes to a larger net growth of wind driven water
waves when the waves are non-linear compared with growth rates for
monochromatic waves. This is because in non- linear waves individual harmonics
have stronger positive and weaker negative growth rates.

uniformly segmenting speech signals, in contrast to existing DNN based BN
feature extraction methods that train DNNs using labeled data to discriminate
speakers or pass-phrases or phones or a combination of them. In the context of

Finally, we use cosmological data to constraint the parametric space of this
dark energy model. Thus, we will use observational data to perform cosmography
for this holographic model based on fluid/gravity duality.

  arXiv:1608.07205",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the ideal Fermi gas that fills the space inside a cylindrical tube, there
are calculated the thermodynamic characteristics in general form for arbitrary
temperatures, namely: the thermodynamic potential, energy, entropy, equations
of state, heat capacities and compressibilities. All these quantities are
expressed through the introduced standard functions and their derivatives. The
radius of the tube is considered as an additional thermodynamic variable. It is
shown that at low temperatures in the quasi-one-dimensional case the
temperature dependencies of the entropy and heat capacities remain linear. The
dependencies of the entropy and heat capacities on the chemical potential have
sharp maximums at the points where the filling of a new discrete level begins.
The character of dependencies of thermodynamic quantities on the tube radius
proves to be qualitatively different in the cases of fixed linear and fixed
total density. At the fixed linear density these dependencies are monotonous
and at the fixed total density they have an oscillating character. Key words:
Fermi particle, nanotube, thermodynamic functions, low-dimensional systems,
equation of state, heat capacity, compressibility

discrete set of times t_n, separated by a small interval $\Delta t$ (which may
also represent a coordinate, etc.). Let the $z$ value in neighbour point
$t_{n+1}=t_n+\Delta t$ be expressed by the evolution equation as $z(t_{n+1})=
z(t_n+\Delta t)=f(z(t_n))$. This equation gives {\it\underline{a discrete
description}} of phenomenon. Considering phenomena at $t\gg \Delta t$ this
equation is transformed often into the differential equation allowing to
determine $z(t)$ -- {\underline{\it continuous description}}. It is usually
assumed that the continuous description describes correctly the main features
of a phenomenon at values $t>> \Delta t$.
  In this paper I show that the real behavior of some physical systems can
differ strongly from that given by the continuous description. The observation
of such effects may lead to the desire to supplement the original evolutionary
model by additional mechanisms, the origin of which require special
explanation. We will show that such construction may not be necessary -- simple
evolution model can describe different observable effects.
  This text contains no new calculations. Most of the discussed facts are well
known. New is the treatment of the results.

terms of the wave action spectrum evolving according the the wave-kinetic

asymptotes to a Gaussian distribution in forced-dissipated wave systems that
approach a steady state. Also, in non-stationary systems, if the statistics is
Gaussian initially, it will remain Gaussian at any time. Generally, the
statistics that is not Gaussian initially will remain non-Gaussian over the
characteristic nonlinear time of the wave spectrum. In freely decaying wave
turbulence, substantial deviations from Gaussianity may persist infinitely
long.

networks when they try to obtain loans from banks. Such secured loan can
enhance the solvency and promote the rapid growth in the economic upturn
period. However, potential systemic risk may happen within the risk binding
community. Especially, during the economic down period, the crisis may spread
in the guarantee network like a domino. Monitoring the financial status,
preventing or reducing systematic risk when crisis happens is highly concerned
by the regulatory commission and banks. We propose visual analytics approach
for loan guarantee network risk management, and consolidate the five analysis
tasks with financial experts: i) visual analytics for enterprises default risk,
whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and
developed an interface to visualize key indicators; ii) visual analytics for
high default groups, whereby a community detection based interactive approach
is presented; iii) visual analytics for high defaults pattern, whereby a motif
detection based interactive approach is described, and we adopt a Shneiderman
Mantra strategy to reduce the computation complexity. iv) visual analytics for
evolving guarantee network, whereby animation is used to help understanding the
guarantee dynamic; v) visual analytics approach and interface for default
diffusion path. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the
government and bank to monitor the default spread status. It also provides
insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systemic
financial risk. We implement the system with case studies on a real-world
guarantee network. Two financial experts are consulted with endorsement on the
developed tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual
analytics tool to explore the guarantee network risks in a systematic manner.

unexplored despite its potential expressiveness. In this paper, we formulate a
general chart pattern search problem to enable cross-representational
quantitative comparison of various search schemes. We suggest a HyperNEAT
framework applying state-of-the-art deep neural network techniques to find
attractive neural network-based chart patterns; These techniques enable a fast
evaluation and search of robust patterns, as well as bringing a performance
gain. The proposed framework successfully found attractive patterns on the
Korean stock market. We compared newly found patterns with those found by
different search schemes, showing the proposed approach has potential.
