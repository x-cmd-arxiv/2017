finally in the most famous two-dimensional semi-metal, namely graphene. We show
that plasmons in bulk metals as well as in a two-dimensional electron gas

thus, they would not exist in a ""classical world"". Furthermore, under certain
circumstances, light is able to couple with plasmons on metallic surfaces,
forming a surface plasmon polariton, which is very important in nanoplasmonics
due to its subwavelength nature. In addition, we outline two applications that
complete our theoretical investigation. Firstly, we examine how the presence of
gain (active) dielectrics affects surface plasmon polariton properties and we
find that there is a gain value for which the metallic losses are completely
eliminated resulting to lossless plasmon propagation. Secondly, we combine
monolayers of graphene in a periodic order and construct a plasmonic

node can be found if it has only a single neighbor; and a whole network can be
localized using only a single anchor node. Numerical results are presented

lead to particle acceleration, and to extended high-energy emitting regions. We
compute the non-thermal emission produced by the jet flow shocked by stellar
winds on the jet scale, far from the jet-star direct interaction region. First,
prescriptions for the winds of the relevant stellar populations in different
types of galaxies are obtained. The scenarios adopted include galaxies with
their central regions dominated by old or young stellar populations, and with
jets of different power. Then, we estimate the available energy to accelerate
particles in the jet shock, and compute the transport and energy evolution of
the accelerated electrons, plus their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission,
in the shocked flow along the jet. A significant fraction of the jet energy,
$\sim 0.1-10$\%, can potentially be available for the particles accelerated in
jet-wind shocks in the studied cases. The non-thermal particles can produce
most of the high-energy radiation on jet scales, far from the jet shock region.
This high-energy emission will be strongly enhanced in jets aligned with the
line of sight due to Doppler boosting effects. The interaction of relativistic
jets with stellar winds may contribute significantly to the persistent
high-energy emission in some AGNs with jets. However, in the particular case of

(C-RANs), where each radio remote head (RRH) is connected to the baseband unit
(BBU) pool through optical links. The RRHs jointly support the users by
efficiently exploiting the enhanced spatial degrees of freedom. Our proposed
scheme aims for maximizing the effective capacity (EC) of the user subject to
both per-RRH average-and peak-power constraints, where the EC is defined as the
maximum arrival rate that can be supported by the C-RAN under the statistical
delay requirement. We first transform the EC maximization problem into an
equivalent convex optimization problem. By using the Lagrange dual
decomposition method and solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) equations, the
optimal transmission power of each RRH can be obtained in closed-form.
Furthermore, an online tracking method is provided for approximating the
average power of each RRH for the sake of updating the Lagrange dual variables.
For the special case of two RRHs, the expression of the average power of each
RRH can be calculated in explicit form. Hence, the Lagrange dual variables can
be computed in advance in this special case. Furthermore, we derive the power
allocation for two important extreme cases: 1) no delay constraint; 2)
extremely stringent delay-requirements. Our simulation results show that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional algorithm without
considering the delay requirements. Furthermore, when appropriately tuning the
value of the delay exponent, our proposed algorithm is capable of guaranteeing
a delay outage probability below $10^{-9}$ when the maximum tolerable delay is
1 ms. This is suitable for the future ultra-reliable low latency communications
(URLLC).

law enforcement and forensic agencies worldwide. Yet, NIST evaluations show
that the performance of state-of-the-art latent recognition systems is far from
satisfactory. An automated latent fingerprint recognition system with high
accuracy is essential to compare latents found at crime scenes to a large
collection of reference prints to generate a candidate list of possible mates.
In this paper, we propose an automated latent fingerprint recognition algorithm
that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for ridge flow
estimation and minutiae descriptor extraction, and extract complementary
templates (two minutiae templates and one texture template) to represent the
latent. The comparison scores between the latent and a reference print based on
the three templates are fused to retrieve a short candidate list from the
reference database. Experimental results show that the rank-1 identification
accuracies (query latent is matched with its true mate in the reference
database) are 64.7% for the NIST SD27 and 75.3% for the WVU latent databases,
against a reference database of 100K rolled prints. These results are the best
among published papers on latent recognition and competitive with the
performance (66.7% and 70.8% rank-1 accuracies on NIST SD27 and WVU DB,
respectively) of a leading COTS latent Automated Fingerprint Identification
System (AFIS). By score-level (rank-level) fusion of our system with the

  Networks",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of topology recognition in wireless (radio) networks
modeled as undirected graphs. Topology recognition is a fundamental task in
which every node of the network has to output a map of the underlying graph
i.e., an isomorphic copy of it, and situate itself in this map. In wireless
networks, nodes communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round a node can
either transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and listen. At
the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in a given
round, if $v$ listens in this round, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that
transmits in this round. Nodes have labels which are (not necessarily
different) binary strings. The length of a labeling scheme is the largest
length of a label. We concentrate on wireless networks modeled by trees, and we
investigate two problems.
  \begin{itemize} \item What is the shortest labeling scheme that permits
topology recognition in all wireless tree networks of diameter $D$ and maximum
degree $\Delta$?
  \item What is the fastest topology recognition algorithm working for all
wireless tree networks of diameter $D$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, using such
a short labeling scheme? \end{itemize}

first problem, we show that the minimum length of a labeling scheme allowing
topology recognition in all trees of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 3$ is
$\Theta(\log\log \Delta)$. For such short schemes, used by an algorithm working
for the class of trees of diameter $D\geq 4$ and maximum degree $\Delta \geq
3$, we show almost matching bounds on the time of topology recognition: an
upper bound $O(D\Delta)$, and a lower bound $\Omega(D\Delta^{\epsilon})$, for
any constant $\epsilon<1$.

Earth masses) embedded in a protoplanetary disc, by means of three dimensional
hydrodynamics calculations with radiative transfer in the diffusion limit. When
the protoplanets radiate in the surrounding disc the energy released by the
accretion of solids, their eccentricity and inclination experience a growth
toward values which depend on the luminosity to mass ratio of the planet, which
are comparable to the disc's aspect ratio and which are reached over timescales
of a few thousand years. This growth is triggered by the appearance of a hot,
under-dense region in the vicinity of the planet. The growth rate of the
eccentricity is typically three times larger than that of the inclination. In
long term calculations, we find that the excitation of eccentricity and the
excitation of inclination are not independent. In the particular case in which
a planet has initially a very small eccentricity and inclination, the
eccentricity largely overruns the inclination. When the eccentricity reaches
its asymptotic value, the growth of inclination is quenched, yielding an
eccentric orbit with a very low inclination. As a side result, we find that the
eccentricity and inclination of non-luminous planets are damped more vigorously
in radiative discs than in isothermal discs.

generalization of the massive scalar field. The latter is a scalar version of
the recently introduced Nonlinear Field Space Theory (NFST), where physical
phase space of a given field is assumed to be compactified at large energies.
For our analysis we choose the simple case of a field with the spherical phase
space and endow it with the generalized Hamiltonian analogous to the XXZ
Heisenberg model, normally describing a system of spins in condensed matter
physics. Subsequently, we study both the homogenous cosmological sector and
linear perturbations of such a test field. In the homogenous sector we find
that nonlinearity of the field phase space is becoming relevant for large
volumes of universe and then it can lead to a recollapse, and possibly also at
very high energies, leading to the phase of a bounce. Quantization of the field
is performed in the limit where nontrivial nature of its phase space can be
neglected, while there is a non-vanishing contribution from the Lorentz
symmetry breaking term of the Hamiltonian. As a result, in the leading order of
the XXZ anisotropy parameter, we find that the inflationary spectral index
remains unmodified with respect to the standard case but the total amplitude of
perturbations is subject to a correction. The Bunch-Davies vacuum state also
becomes appropriately corrected. The proposed new approach is bringing
cosmology and condensed matter physics closer together, which may turn out to
be beneficial for both disciplines.

satisfaction problems (CSPs) over the Boolean domain as being either in
$\mathsf{P}$ or $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. This paper considers a promise-problem
variant of CSPs called PCSPs. A PCSP over a finite set of pairs of constraints
$\Gamma$ consists of a pair $(\Psi_P, \Psi_Q)$ of CSPs with the same set of
variables such that for every $(P, Q) \in \Gamma$, $P(x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_k})$
is a clause of $\Psi_P$ if and only if $Q(x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_k})$ is a clause
of $\Psi_Q$. The promise problem $\operatorname{PCSP}(\Gamma)$ is to
distinguish, given $(\Psi_P, \Psi_Q)$, between the cases $\Psi_P$ is
satisfiable and $\Psi_Q$ is unsatisfiable. Many natural problems including
approximate graph and hypergraph coloring can be placed in this framework.
  This paper is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the computational
complexity of Boolean promise CSPs. As our main result, we show that
$\operatorname{PCSP}(\Gamma)$ exhibits a dichotomy (it is either polynomial
time solvable or $\mathsf{NP}$-hard) when the relations in $\Gamma$ are
symmetric and allow for negations of variables. We achieve our dichotomy
theorem by extending the weak polymorphism framework of Austrin, Guruswami, and
H\aa stad [FOCS '14] which itself is a generalization of the algebraic approach
to study CSPs. In both the algorithm and hardness portions of our proof, we
incorporate new ideas and techniques not utilized in the CSP case.
  Furthermore, we show that the computational complexity of any promise CSP
(over arbitrary finite domains) is captured entirely by its weak polymorphisms,
a feature known as Galois correspondence, as well as give necessary and
sufficient conditions for the structure of this set of weak polymorphisms. Such
insights call us to question the existence of a general dichotomy for Boolean
PCSPs.

operators to local operators while at the same time all locality preserving
unitaries can be represented in a matrix product way. Moreover, we show that
the matrix product representation gives a straight-forward way to extract the

preserving unitaries. The key to our discussion is a set of `fixed point'
conditions which characterize the form of the matrix product unitary operators
after blocking sites. Finally, we show that if the unitary condition is relaxed
and only required for certain system sizes, the matrix product operator
formalism allows more possibilities than locality preserving unitaries. In
particular, we give an example of a simple matrix product operator which is
unitary only for odd system sizes, does not preserve locality and carries a
`fractional' index as compared to their locality preserving counterparts.

modeling of decision making processes and their facilitation directs attention
to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). At the core of the AHP are various
prioritization procedures (PPs) and consistency measures (CMs) for a Pairwise
Comparison Matrix (PCM) which, in a sense, reflects preferences of decision
makers. Certainly, when judgments about these preferences are perfectly
consistent (cardinally transitive), all PPs coincide and the quality of the
priority ratios (PRs) estimation is exemplary. However, human judgments are
very rarely consistent, thus the quality of PRs estimation may significantly
vary. The scale of these variations depends on the applied PP and utilized CM
for a PCM. This is why it is important to find out which PPs and which CMs for
a PCM lead directly to an improvement of the PRs estimation accuracy. The main
goal of this research is realized through the properly designed, coded and
executed seminal and sophisticated simulation algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica
8.0. These research results convince that the embedded in the AHP and commonly
applied, both genuine PP and CM for PCM may significantly deteriorate the

can sample any graph from: simple graphs; multigraphs (which may have
multiedges); and pseudographs (which may have multiedges and/or multiple
self-loops). In this note we extend these MCMC methods to `multiloop-graphs',
which allow multiple self-loops but not multiedges and `loopy-multigraphs'
which allow multiedges and single self-loops. We demonstrate that there are
degree sequences on which the standard MCMC methods cannot uniformly sample
multiloop-graphs, and exactly characterize which degree sequences can and
cannot be so sampled. In contrast, we prove that such MCMC methods can sample
all loopy-multigraphs. Taken together with recent work on graphs which allow
single self-loops but no multiedges, this work completes the study of the
connectivity (irreducibility) of double edge-swap Markov chains for all

fortuitous pre-explosion images. Using the high-resolution Hubble Space
Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3, we study the
massive star population found within 100pc of each our target SNe. For most of
the SNe in our sample, we find that there are multiple age components in the
surrounding stellar populations. In the cases of SNe~2003gd and 2005cs, we find
that the progenitor does not come from the youngest stellar population
component and, in fact, these relatively low mass progenitors ($\sim
8M_{\odot}$) are found in close proximity to stars as massive as $15$ and
$50-60M_{\odot}$, respectively. Overall, the field extinction (Galactic and
host) derived for these populations is $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{mags}$ higher than
the extinction that was generally applied in previously reported progenitor
analyses. We also find evidence, in particular for SN~2004dj, for significant
levels of differential extinction. Our analysis for SN~2008bk suggests a
significantly lower extinction for the population than the progenitor, but the
lifetime of the population and mass determined from pre-explosion images agree.
Overall, assuming that the appropriate age component can be suitably identified
from the multiple stellar population components present, we find that our
Bayesian approach to studying resolved stellar populations can match progenitor
masses determined from direct imaging to within $\pm 3M_{\odot}$.

high-resolution DM simulations. We detect weak mass segregation in the inner
regions of group/cluster haloes, consistent with observational findings. This
applies to samples of galaxy analogues selected using either their present-day
mass or past maximum (peak) mass. We find a strong radial trend in the
fractional mass lost by the galaxies since peak, independent of their mass.
This suggests that segregation is due to massive galaxies having formed closer
to the halo centres and not the preferential destruction of smaller galaxies
near halo centres. We divide our sample into galaxies that were accreted as a
group vs. as a single, distinct halo. We find strong evidence for preprocessing
-- the grouped galaxies lose $\sim 35-45\%$ of their peak mass before being
accreted onto their final host haloes, compared to single galaxies which lose
$\sim12\%$. After accretion, however, the single galaxies lose more mass
compared to the grouped ones. These results are consistent with a scenario in
which grouped galaxies are preprocessed in smaller haloes while single galaxies
`catch up' in terms of total mass loss once they are accreted onto the final
host halo. The fractional mass loss is mostly independent of the galaxy mass
and host mass, and increases with amount of time spent in a dense environment.

massive QGs that also resulted in spheroidal systems. Finally, we measured
residual-corrected surface brightness profiles for our sample. These show that
the Sersic parameterization is generally representative out to several

out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) signals quantum-information scrambling in
many-body systems. The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability represents
operators in quantum optics. The OTOC has been shown to equal a moment of a
summed quasiprobability. That quasiprobability, we argue, is an extension of
the KD distribution. We explore the quasiprobability's structure from
experimental, numerical, and theoretical perspectives. First, we simplify and
analyze the weak-measurement and interference protocols for measuring the OTOC
and its quasiprobability. We decrease, exponentially in system size, the number
of trials required to infer the OTOC from weak measurements. We also construct
a circuit for implementing the weak-measurement scheme. Next, we calculate the
quasiprobability (after coarse-graining) numerically and analytically: We
simulate a transverse-field Ising model first. Then, we calculate the
quasiprobability averaged over random circuits, which model chaotic dynamics.
The quasiprobability, we find, distinguishes chaotic from integrable regimes.
We observe nonclassical behaviors: The quasiprobability typically has negative
components. It becomes nonreal in some regimes. The onset of scrambling breaks
a symmetry that bifurcates the quasiprobability, as in classical-chaos
pitchforks. Finally, we present mathematical properties. The quasiprobability
obeys a Bayes-type theorem, for example, that exponentially decreases the
memory required to calculate weak values, in certain cases. A time-ordered
correlator analogous to the OTOC, insensitive to quantum-information
scrambling, depends on a quasiprobability closer to a classical probability.
This work not only illuminates the OTOC's underpinnings, but also generalizes
quasiprobability theory and motivates immediate-future weak-measurement
challenges.

analyze the ALMA visibilities in tandem with the broad-band spectral energy
distribution to measure the radial surface density profiles of dust and gas
emission from the system. The dust surface density decreases with radius
between ~100 and 310 au, with a marginally significant enhancement of surface
density at a radius of ~110 au. The SED requires an inner disk of small grains
in addition to the outer disk of larger grains resolved by ALMA. The gas disk
exhibits a surface density profile that increases with radius, contrary to most
previous spatially resolved observations of circumstellar gas disks. While ~80%
of the CO flux is well described by an axisymmetric power-law disk in Keplerian
rotation about the central star, residuals at ~20% of the peak flux exhibit a
departure from axisymmetry suggestive of spiral arms or a warp in the gas disk.
The radial extent of the gas disk (~220 au) is smaller than that of the dust
disk (~300 au), consistent with recent observations of other gas-bearing debris
disks. While there are so far only three broad debris disks with well
characterized radial dust profiles at millimeter wavelengths, 49 Ceti's disk
shows a markedly different structure from two radially resolved gas-poor debris
disks, implying that the physical processes generating and sculpting the gas

delay requirements and offload traffic from peak periods. By storing parts of
the popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested
files in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case,
when a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device (D2D)
communication is enabled. D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks is
also a new paradigm for the upcoming 5G wireless systems. By allowing a pair of
adjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D communication can achieve
higher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay. In this
work, we propose a very efficient caching algorithm for D2D-enabled cellular
networks to minimize the average transmission delay. Instead of searching over
all possible solutions, our algorithm finds out the best <file,user> pairs,
which provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy
with very low transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also
extended to address a more general scenario, in which the distributions of
fading coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over
time. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is
verified by comparing it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply
cache their favorite files.

Chern insulator subjected to a circular time-periodic perturbation: due to the
system's chiral nature, the depletion rate is shown to depend on the
orientation of the circular shake. Most importantly, taking the difference
between the rates obtained from two opposite orientations of the drive, and
integrating over a proper drive-frequency range, provides a direct measure of
the topological Chern number of the populated band ($\nu$): this ""differential
integrated rate"" is directly related to the strength of the driving field
through the quantized coefficient $\eta_0\!=\!\nu /\hbar^2$. Contrary to the
integer quantum Hall effect, this quantized response is found to be non-linear
with respect to the strength of the driving field and it explicitly involves
inter-band transitions. We investigate the possibility of probing this
phenomenon in ultracold gases and highlight the crucial role played by edge
states in this effect. We extend our results to 3D lattices, establishing a
link between depletion rates and the non-linear photogalvanic effect predicted

in such signals to encode them into few number of bits. Compressed sensing
recovery algorithms on the other hand use such signals' structures to recover
them from few linear observations. Despite the steady progress in the field of
compressed sensing, structures that are often used for signal recovery are
still much simpler than those employed by state-of-the-art compression codes.
The main goal of this paper is to bridge this gap through answering the
following question: Can one employ a given compression code to build an
efficient (polynomial time) compressed sensing recovery algorithm? In response
to this question, the compression-based gradient descent (C-GD) algorithm is
proposed. C-GD, which is a low-complexity iterative algorithm, is able to
employ a generic compression code for compressed sensing and therefore elevates
the scope of structures used in compressed sensing to those used by compression
codes. The convergence performance of C-GD and its required number of
measurements in terms of the rate-distortion performance of the compression
code are theoretically analyzed. It is also shown that C-GD is robust to
additive white Gaussian noise. Finally, the presented simulation results show
that combining C-GD with commercial image compression codes such as JPEG2000
yields state-of-the-art performance in imaging applications.

a self-consistent relationship between the CME center-of-mass motion detected

entirely based on EUV dimming observations (using AIA/SDO data) and complements
the traditional white-light scattering model (using LASCO/SOHO data), and both
models are independently capable to determine fundamental CME parameters such

LASCO is less sensitive than AIA in detecting CMEs (in 24$\%$ of the cases);
(2) CME masses below $m_{cme} \sim 10^{14}$ g are under-estimated by LASCO; (3)
AIA and LASCO masses, speeds, and energy agree closely in the statistical mean

approach on five graph processing packages: GraphMat, the Graph500, the Graph
Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite, GraphBIG, and PowerGraph using synthetic

high velocity neutral hydrogen clouds in our Galaxy halo, line emitting ionised
hydrogen originating from galactic winds in nearby starburst galaxies, and the
X-ray coronas surrounding the most massive galaxies, accounting for the gas in

of its low density in the expansive halo. The most sensitive measurements come
from detecting absorption by the intervening gas in the spectra of distant

velocity field that appears rotated with respect to the resolved disk geometry,

accretion streams, which may be responsible for the long-duration dimming of
optical light from AA Tau.

revolutionary tool to study cellular and molecular processes at single cell

platform enables efficient parallel processing of thousands of single cells
with direct counting of transcript copies using Unique Molecular Identifier
(UMI). Despite the technology advances, statistical methods and computational
tools are still lacking for analyzing droplet-based scRNA-Seq data.
Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell
transcriptomic data are still under-explored. Methods: We developed DIMM-SC, a
Dirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic
data. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments
and characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichlet
mixture prior. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used for parameter
inference. Results: We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SC
and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and
Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known cluster
labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis with
prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulation
studies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achieves
substantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clustering
variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as
a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty
for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference and
biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existing
clustering methods.

is based on biology. For learning, spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) may
be implemented using an energy efficient waveform superposition on memristor
based synapse. However, system level implementation has three challenges.
First, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short
voltage$-$spikes which is disturbed by large voltage$-$waveforms that are
simultaneously applied on the same memristor for real$-$time learning i.e. the
simultaneous read$-$write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly
replicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware.
Third, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this
paper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the
learning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in
real$-$time, asynchronously $-$ avoiding non$-$biomimetic clocking based
complex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software
at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit$-$simulator) with MATLAB
(mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an
example, the hardware shows 97.5 per cent accuracy in classification which is
equivalent to software for a Fisher$-$Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is
implemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO2 memristor.
We show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the
hardware performance (85 per cent), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM
characteristics specifically for SNN.

  A conflict-free coloring of a graph is a coloring of its vertices such that
the neighborhood (pointed or closed) of each vertex contains a vertex whose
color differs from the colors of all other vertices in that neighborhood. In
this paper we study conflict-colorings of intersection graphs of geometric
objects. We show that any intersection graph of n pseudo-discs in the plane
admits a conflict-free coloring with O(\log n) colors, with respect to both
closed and pointed neighborhoods. We also show that the latter bound is
asymptotically sharp. Using our methods, we also obtain a strengthening of the
two main results of Even et al. which we believe is of independent interest. In
particular, in view of the original motivation to study such colorings, this
strengthening suggests further applications to frequency assignment in wireless
networks.
  Finally, we present bounds on the number of colors needed for conflict-free
colorings of other classes of intersection graphs, including intersection
graphs of axis-parallel rectangles and of \rho-fat objects in the plane.

Se, Te), in the presence of vacancy defects (VDs). Defects usually play an
important role in tailoring electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of
semiconductors. We consider three types of VDs in SL TMDCs i) $X$-vacancy,
$X_{2}$-vacancy, and iii) $M$-vacancy. We show that VDs lead to localized
defect states (LDS) in the band structure, which in turn give rise to sharp
transitions in in-plane and out-of-plane optical susceptibilities,
$\chi_{\parallel}$ and $\chi_{\perp}$. The effects of spin orbit coupling (SOC)
are also considered. We find that SOC splitting in LDS is directly related to
the atomic number of the transition metal atoms. Apart from electronic and
optical properties we also find magnetic signatures (local magnetic moment of
$\sim\mu_{B}$) in MoSe$_{2}$ in the presence of Mo vacancy, which breaks the
time reversal symmetry and therefore lifts the Kramers degeneracy. We show that
a simple qualitative tight binding model (TBM), involving only the hopping
between atoms surrounding the vacancy with an on-site SOC term, is sufficient
to capture the essential features of LDS. In addition, the existence of the LDS
can be understood from the solution of the 2D Dirac Hamiltonian by employing
infinite mass boundary conditions. In order to provide a clear description of

finding the minimum energy to drive a fixed stationary state x = 0 into an
arbitrary non-stationary state x. The Riccati Equation (RE) associated to this
problem is not standard since the sign of the linear part is opposite to the
usual one, thus preventing the use of the known theory. Here we consider the
finite horizon case. We prove that the linear selfadjoint operator P(t),
associated to the value function, solves the above mentioned RE (Theorem 4.12).
Uniqueness does not hold in general but we are able to prove a partial
uniqueness result in the class of invertible operators (Theorem 4.13). In the
special case where the involved operators commute, a more detailed analysis of
the set of solutions is given (Theorems 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16). Examples of
applications are given.

but the relationship between the electron mobility and the sheet electron
density, $n_s$, is poorly understood. Here we derive a simple expression for
the three-dimensional electron density near the interface, $n_{3D}$, as a
function of $n_s$ and find that the mobility for LAO/STO-based interfaces
depends on $n_{3D}$ in the same way as it does for bulk doped STO. It is known
that undoped bulk STO is strongly compensated with $N \simeq 5 \times
10^{18}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$ background donors and acceptors. In intentionally doped
bulk STO with a concentration of electrons $n_{3D} < N$ background impurities
determine the electron scattering. Thus, when $n_{3D} < N$ it is natural to see
in LAO/STO the same mobility as in the bulk. On the other hand, in the bulk
samples with $n_{3D} > N$ the mobility collapses because scattering happens on
$n_{3D}$ intentionally introduced donors. For LAO/STO the polar catastrophe
which provides electrons is not supposed to provide equal number of random
donors and thus the mobility should be larger. The fact that the mobility is
still the same implies that for the LAO/STO the polar catastrophe model should
be revisited.

presence of a concave potential of the form $V(\phi) = V_0 \left[1- \left(
\frac{\phi}{\mu}\right)^n\right]$, where $V_0$ is a constant, and $\mu$ is a
mass scale. We show that there are two classes of equilibrium points. The first
class corresponds to $\phi \neq 0$, $\mu \neq 0$, $n = 0$, and $\dot{\phi} =
0$, which describe expanding and contracting de Sitter universes, for which the
shear anisotropy is zero. We show that the expanding de Sitter universe is a
local sink of the system, and therefore has associated to it a stable manifold.
Thus, orbits will approach this point at late times. In other words, such a
model is found to inflate and isotropize at late times as long as $n = 0$. The
second class of equilibrium points corresponds to an expanding and contracting
anisotropic universe. However, these points are found to emerge only when $n >
1$, $\phi = \dot{\phi} = 0$, which importantly implies that $V = V_0 < 0$ at
this point in order to ensure that the square of the shear scalar, $\sigma^2$
is real. Therefore, such equilibrium points correspond to the ekpyrotic
cosmological models. Further, we show that for $n = 2$, by Lyapunov's stability
theorem, the expanding equilibrium point is asymptotically stable, while for $n
> 2$, a two-dimensional stable manifold exists corresponding to the fact that
for $n > 2$, such an equilibrium point represents a local sink of the system.
Finally, we give a general condition for inflation to occur in this model in
terms of the deceleration parameter, and show that the expanding ekpyrotic
equilibrium point undergoes the phenomenon of anisotropic inflation if
$-3\Lambda/5 < V_0 < 0$, where $\Lambda > 0$ is the cosmological constant.

conventional subject ar- eas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular

has been sparked by dramatic enhancements of experimental capabilities in
ultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which now permit atoms and
molecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit with controllable
two-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic or
electromagnetically-dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows in particular
access to the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering
lengths far exceed all other length scales in the problem. The Efimov effect,
where 3 particles experienc- ing short-range interactions can
counterintuitively exhibit an infinite number of bound or quasi-bound energy

field of universal Efimov physics has taken off, driven particularly by a
combination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and
prior to the first observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical
studies dating back to 1970. Because experimental observations of Efimov

The shape of the experimentally observed stress-strain diagram is called
J-shaped. Indeed, the diagram has a plateau for the small strain region and
becomes linear in the relatively large strain region. Because of this highly
non-linear behavior, the J-shaped diagram is far beyond the scope of the
ordinary theory of elasticity. Therefore, the mechanism behind the J-shaped
diagram still remains to be clarified, although it is commonly believed that
the collagen degrees of freedom play an essential role. We find that the FG

problem of link flow correction, when the available traffic flow data on many
links in a road network are inconsistent with respect to the flow conservation
law. Without extra information, the problem is generally ill-posed when a large
portion of the link sensors are unhealthy. It is possible, however, to correct
the corrupted link flows \textit{accurately} with the proposed method under a
recoverability condition if there are only a few bad sensors which are located
at certain links. We analytically identify the links that are robust to
miscounts and relate them to the geometric structure of the traffic network by
introducing the recoverability concept and an algorithm for computing it. The
recoverability condition for corrupted links is simply the associated
recoverability being greater than 1. In a more realistic setting, besides the
unhealthy link sensors, small measurement noises may be present at the other
sensors. Under the same recoverability condition, our method guarantees to give
an estimated traffic flow fairly close to the ground-truth data and leads to a
bound for the correction error. Both synthetic and real-world examples are

score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use

an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity

This model is a generalization of the square lattice quantum dimer model as its
configuration space comprises fully-packed hard-core dimer coverings as well as
dimer configurations containing pentamers, where four dimers touch a vertex.
Thus in the QDPM, the fully-packed, hard-core constraint of the quantum dimer
model is relaxed such that the local dimer number at each vertex is fixed
modulo 3, resulting in an exact local $Z_3$ gauge symmetry. We construct a
local Hamiltonian for which the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) equal superposition state
is the exact ground state and has a 9-fold topological degeneracy on the torus.
Using Monte Carlo calculations, we find no spontaneous symmetry breaking in the
RK wavefunction and that its dimer-dimer correlation function decays
exponentially. By doping the QDPM RK state with a pair of monomers, we
demonstrate that $Z_3$ electric charges are deconfined. Additionally, we
introduce a $Z_3$ magnetic string operator that we find decays exponentially
and shows no signatures of magnetic vortex condensation and with correlations.
These numerical results suggest that the ground state of the QDPM is a dimer
liquid with $Z_3$ topological order.

tackle this conundrum by re-evaluating the $\beta$ ratio of interstellar grains

involving drift and that the locations of the data sources are
Poisson-distributed. In this setting, we characterize the performance of the
robot in terms of its sensing, agility, and computation capabilities. More
specifically, the robot's performance is characterized in terms of its ability
to sense the target locations from a distance, to maneuver quickly, and to
perform computations for inference and planning. We also characterize the
performance of the robot in terms of the amount and distribution of information
that can be acquired at each data source. The following are among our
theoretical results: the distribution of the amount of information among the
target locations immensely impacts the requirements for sensing targets from a
distance; performance increases with increasing maneuvering capability, but
with diminishing returns; and the computation requirements increase more
rapidly for planning as opposed to inference, with both increasing sensing
range and maneuvering ability. We provide computational experiments to validate
our theoretical results. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be
utilized in the co-design of sensing, actuation, and computation capabilities

the idea of evolutionary deep intelligence, which mimics biological evolution

factor in evolutionary deep intelligence is the genetic encoding scheme used to
simulate heredity and determine the architectures of offspring networks. In
this study, we take a deeper look at the notion of synaptic cluster-driven
evolution of deep neural networks which guides the evolution process towards
the formation of a highly sparse set of synaptic clusters in offspring
networks. Utilizing a synaptic cluster-driven genetic encoding, the
probabilistic encoding of synaptic traits considers not only individual
synaptic properties but also inter-synaptic relationships within a deep neural
network. This process results in highly sparse offspring networks which are
particularly tailored for parallel computational devices such as GPUs and deep
neural network accelerator chips. Comprehensive experimental results using four
well-known deep neural network architectures (LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet-56, and
DetectNet) on two different tasks (object categorization and object detection)
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Cluster-driven genetic
encoding scheme synthesizes networks that can achieve state-of-the-art
performance with significantly smaller number of synapses than that of the
original ancestor network. ($\sim$125-fold decrease in synapses for MNIST).
Furthermore, the improved cluster efficiency in the generated offspring
networks ($\sim$9.71-fold decrease in clusters for MNIST and a $\sim$8.16-fold
decrease in clusters for KITTI) is particularly useful for accelerated
performance on parallel computing hardware architectures such as those in GPUs

filter, propagating the second-order moment (i.e. variance) of the number of
targets alongside its mean. The resulting algorithm is more versatile in the
modelling choices than the PHD filter, and its computational cost is
significantly lower compared to the CPHD filter. The paper compares the three
filters in statistical simulations which demonstrate that the proposed filter
reacts more quickly to changes in the number of targets, i.e., target births
and target deaths, than the CPHD filter. In addition, a new statistic for
multi-object filters is introduced in order to study the correlation between
the estimated number of targets in different regions of the state space, and
propose a quantitative analysis of the spooky effect for the three filters.

based on low-degree polynomials, the study of which is pervasive in theoretical
computer science. Unfortunately, known methods for endowing such proofs with
zero knowledge guarantees do not retain this rich algebraic structure.
  In this work, we develop algebraic techniques for obtaining zero knowledge
variants of proof protocols in a way that leverages and preserves their
algebraic structure. Our constructions achieve unconditional (perfect) zero
knowledge in the Interactive Probabilistically Checkable Proof (IPCP) model of
Kalai and Raz [KR08] (the prover first sends a PCP oracle, then the prover and
verifier engage in an Interactive Proof in which the verifier may query the
PCP).
  Our main result is a zero knowledge variant of the sumcheck protocol [LFKN92]
in the IPCP model. The sumcheck protocol is a key building block in many IPs,
including the protocol for polynomial-space computation due to Shamir [Sha92],
and the protocol for parallel computation due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and
Rothblum [GKR15]. A core component of our result is an algebraic commitment
scheme, whose hiding property is guaranteed by algebraic query complexity lower
bounds [AW09,JKRS09]. This commitment scheme can then be used to considerably
strengthen our previous work [BCFGRS16] that gives a sumcheck protocol with
much weaker zero knowledge guarantees, itself using algebraic techniques based
on algorithms for polynomial identity testing [RS05,BW04].
  We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by deriving zero knowledge
variants of well-known protocols based on algebraic techniques, including the
protocols of Shamir and of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, as well as the
protocol of Babai, Fortnow, and Lund [BFL91].

and identified GAE structures using the ideal MHD solver CKA and the
gyrokinetic code EUTERPE. An analytic model for ICRH-heated minority ions is
used to estimate the fast ion temperature from the hydrogen species. Linear
growth rate scans using a local flux surface stability calculation, LGRO, are
performed. These studies demonstrate growth from circulating particles whose
speed is significantly less than the Alfven speed, and are resonant with the
mode through harmonics of the Fourier decomposition of the strongly-shaped
heliac magnetic field. They reveal drive is possible with a small, hot
energetic tail of the hydrogen species. Local linear growth rate scans are also
complemented with global calculations from CKA and EUTERPE. These qualitatively
confirm the findings from the LGRO study, and show that the inclusion of finite
Larmor radius effects can reduce the growth rate by a factor of three, but do
not affect marginal stability. Finally, a study of damping of the global mode
with the thermal plasma is conducted, computing continuum, and the damping
arising from parallel electric fields. We find that continuum damping is of
order 0.1% for the configuration studied. The inclusion of resistivity lifts
the damping to 19%. Such large damping is consistent with experimental
observations that in absence of drive the mode decays rapidly (~0.1 ms).

of the binary changes along the binary orbit over the superorbital period,
causing the phase shifts in the modulation, and around periastron, the compact

inter-atomic magnetic exchange interactions arising due to the non-regular site
occupancies of the magnetic cations in the system. In this work, we perform
{\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations by DFT+U method and combine
with a generalised thermodynamic model to compute the site occupancy patterns
of the magnetic cations, the structural properties and the magnetic exchange
interactions of Co$\left(Cr_{1-x}Fe_{x} \right)_{2}$O$_{4}$ for the entire
composition range $0<x<1$. We find that the substituting Fe atoms prefer to
occupy the tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure for the entire range of
$x$, in agreement with the experimental inferences. Our results on the
variations of the structural parameters with compositions agree very well with
the experiments. By computing the variations of the various inter-atomic

orbital-projected densities of states. The results and analysis presented in

  Conference on MicroManufacturing, UC Irvine, 2016",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integrated micro-nanochannel networks in fluidic devices are desirable in a
number of applications ranging from self-healing/cooling materials to
bioengineering. The conventional micro-manufacturing techniques are capable of
either producing microchannel or nanochannel networks for a fluidic application
but lack proficiency in the production of an integrated micro-nanochannel
network with a smooth transition from micro-to-nano scale dimension. In
addition, these techniques possess limitations such as heavy initial
investment, sophistication in operation and scale-up capabilities. Therefore,
the current paper demonstrates the combination of micro/nanotechnologies to
design and develop a biomimetic 3-D integrated micro-nanochannel network in
PDMS device for solute exchange. We have used 3-D printer, a scalable
technology, to design and manufacture micro-mold having fractal-shaped
features. Further, electrospinning was used to deposit nanofibrous network on
the fractal mold. Subsequent micro-molding with PDMS was used to obtain
fractal-shaped microchannels integrated with embedded nanofibers. Henceforth,
solvent etching of nanofibers followed by bonding of thin PDMS membrane
generated by spin coating to open end of channels leads to the formation of
functional microdevices. These PDMS devices mimic the natural vasculature of a
living system, where fractal-shaped microchannels will assist in efficient
fluid flow and the site of nanovascular network participates in heat/mass
transport operations. Further, dye flow propounds the functionality of such
devices. Our study hence proposes a simple and scalable hybrid microtechnolgy
to fabricate fluidic devices having multiscale architecture. This will also
facilitate the rapid fabrication of microfluidic devices for biomedical,
diagnostics, sensors and micro-TAS applications.

motivated by JL Lemma and an emerging field of Compressed Subspace Clustering
(CSC), we study for the first time the RIP of Gaussian random matrices for the
compression of two subspaces based on the generalized projection $F$-norm
distance. We theoretically prove that with high probability the affinity or
distance between two projected subspaces are concentrated around their
estimates. When the ambient dimension after projection is sufficiently large,
the affinity and distance between two subspaces almost remain unchanged after
random projection. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical work.

across multimedia data such as image and text. A two-stage learning framework
is widely adopted by most existing methods based on Deep Neural Network (DNN):
The first learning stage is to generate separate representation for each
modality, and the second learning stage is to get the cross-modal common
representation. However, the existing methods have three limitations: (1) In
the first learning stage, they only model intra-modality correlation, but
ignore inter-modality correlation with rich complementary context. (2) In the
second learning stage, they only adopt shallow networks with single-loss
regularization, but ignore the intrinsic relevance of intra-modality and
inter-modality correlation. (3) Only original instances are considered while
the complementary fine-grained clues provided by their patches are ignored. For
addressing the above problems, this paper proposes a cross-modal correlation
learning (CCL) approach with multi-grained fusion by hierarchical network, and
the contributions are as follows: (1) In the first learning stage, CCL exploits
multi-level association with joint optimization to preserve the complementary
context from intra-modality and inter-modality correlation simultaneously. (2)
In the second learning stage, a multi-task learning strategy is designed to
adaptively balance the intra-modality semantic category constraints and
inter-modality pairwise similarity constraints. (3) CCL adopts multi-grained
modeling, which fuses the coarse-grained instances and fine-grained patches to
make cross-modal correlation more precise. Comparing with 13 state-of-the-art
methods on 6 widely-used cross-modal datasets, the experimental results show
our CCL approach achieves the best performance.

due to significant presence of occluded and partially visible faces. One
promising technique to handle the challenge of partial faces is to design face
detectors based on facial segments. In this paper two different approaches of
facial segment-based face detection are discussed, namely, proposal-based
detection and detection by end-to-end regression. Methods that follow the first
approach rely on generating face proposals that contain facial segment
information. The three detectors following this approach, namely Facial
Segment-based Face Detector (FSFD), SegFace and DeepSegFace, discussed in this
paper, perform binary classification on each proposal based on features learned
from facial segments. The process of proposal generation, however, needs to be
handled separately, which can be very time consuming, and is not truly
necessary given the nature of the active authentication problem. Hence a novel
algorithm, Deep Regression-based User Image Detector (DRUID) is proposed, which
shifts from the classification to the regression paradigm, thus obviating the
need for proposal generation. DRUID has an unique network architecture with
customized loss functions, is trained using a relatively small amount of data
by utilizing a novel data augmentation scheme and is fast since it outputs the
bounding boxes of a face and its segments in a single pass. Being robust to
occlusion by design, the facial segment-based face detection methods,
especially DRUID show superior performance over other state-of-the-art face
detectors in terms of precision-recall and ROC curve on two mobile face
datasets.

viscid fluids. A natural analogue of Brenier's problem is introduced, where
generalized flows are no more supported by absolutely continuous paths, but by
Brownian sample paths. It turns out that this new variational problem is an
entropy minimization problem with marginal constraints entering the class of
convex minimization problems. This paper explores the connection between this
variational problem and Brenier's original problem. Its dual problem is derived
and the general shape of its solution is described. Under the restrictive
assumption that the pressure is a nice function, the kinematics of its solution
is made explicit and its connection with the Navier-Stokes equation is
established.

how much entanglement is needed to run such DI protocols? We present a

approximately $n$ bits of randomness starting from $n$ pairs of arbitrarily

the 183 GHz H2O line towards all the stars with peak flux densities greater
than 100 Jy, including a new detection from VY CMa. Towards all 5 targets, the
water line had indications of being due to maser emission and had higher peak
flux densities than for the SiO lines. The SiO lines appear to originate from
both thermal and maser processes. Comparison with simulations and models
indicate that 183 GHz maser emission is likely to extend to greater radii in
the circumstellar envelopes than SiO maser emission and to similar or greater
radii than water masers at 22, 321 and 325 GHz. We speculate that a prominent
blue-shifted feature in the W Hya 183 GHz spectrum is amplifying the stellar
continuum, and is located at a similar distance from the star as mainline OH
maser emission. From a comparison of the individual polarizations, we find that
the SiO maser linear polarization fraction of several features exceeds the
maximum fraction allowed under standard maser assumptions and requires strong
anisotropic pumping of the maser transition and strongly saturated maser
emission. The low polarization fraction of the H2O maser however, fits with the
expectation for a non-saturated maser. 183 GHz H2O masers can provide strong
probes of the mass loss process of evolved stars. Higher angular resolution
observations of this line using ALMA Band 5 will enable detailed investigation
of the emission location in circumstellar envelopes and can also provide
information on magnetic field strength and structure.

possibility of detecting within a finite delay and within a given accuracy if a

approximate sense is primarily motivated by the fact that system outputs in
concrete applications are measured by sensors that introduce measurement
errors. Consequently, it is not possible to detect exactly if the state of the
system has reached or not the set of faulty states. In order to check
approximate diagnosability on the class of nonlinear systems we use tools from
formal methods. We first derive a symbolic model approximating the original
system within any desired accuracy. This step allows us to check approximate
diagnosability of the symbolic model. We then establish the relation between
approximate diagnosability of the symbolic model and of the original nonlinear

upper and a lower bound in terms of the degree of interaction of existential
variables (short: degree)}---a novel measure of how many separate existential
quantifier blocks in a sentence are connected via joint occurrences of
variables in atoms. Our main result is the $k$-NEXPTIME-completeness of the
satisfiability problem for the set $SF_{\leq k}$ of all SF sentences that have
degree $k$ or smaller. Consequently, we show that SF-satisfiability is
non-elementary in general, since SF is defined without restrictions on the
degree. Beyond trivial lower bounds, nothing has been known about the hardness
of SF-satisfiability so far.

for data-driven decision making, a problem with potential applications ranging
from automated image recognition to medical diagnosis. Many of those algorithms
are implementations of quantum classifiers, or models for the classification of
data inputs with a quantum computer. Following the success of collective
decision making with ensembles in classical machine learning, this paper
introduces the concept of quantum ensembles of quantum classifiers. Creating
the ensemble corresponds to a state preparation routine, after which the
quantum classifiers are evaluated in parallel and their combined decision is
accessed by a single-qubit measurement. This framework naturally allows for
exponentially large ensembles in which -- similar to Bayesian learning -- the
individual classifiers do not have to be trained. As an example, we analyse an
exponentially large quantum ensemble in which each classifier is weighed
according to its performance in classifying the training data, leading to new
results for quantum as well as classical machine learning.

clusters at an increasingly finer granularity. Motivated by the fact that most
work on hierarchical clustering was based on providing algorithms, rather than
optimizing a specific objective, Dasgupta framed similarity-based hierarchical
clustering as a combinatorial optimization problem, where a `good' hierarchical
clustering is one that minimizes some cost function. He showed that this cost
function has certain desirable properties.
  We take an axiomatic approach to defining `good' objective functions for both
similarity and dissimilarity-based hierarchical clustering. We characterize a
set of ""admissible"" objective functions (that includes Dasgupta's one) that
have the property that when the input admits a `natural' hierarchical
clustering, it has an optimal value.
  Equipped with a suitable objective function, we analyze the performance of
practical algorithms, as well as develop better algorithms. For
similarity-based hierarchical clustering, Dasgupta showed that the divisive
sparsest-cut approach achieves an $O(\log^{3/2} n)$-approximation. We give a
refined analysis of the algorithm and show that it in fact achieves an
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$-approx. (Charikar and Chatziafratis independently proved
that it is a $O(\sqrt{\log n})$-approx.). This improves upon the LP-based
$O(\log n)$-approx. of Roy and Pokutta. For dissimilarity-based hierarchical
clustering, we show that the classic average-linkage algorithm gives a factor 2
approx., and provide a simple and better algorithm that gives a factor 3/2
approx..
  Finally, we consider `beyond-worst-case' scenario through a generalisation of
the stochastic block model for hierarchical clustering. We show that Dasgupta's
cost function has desirable properties for these inputs and we provide a simple
1 + o(1)-approximation in this setting.

of heavy atoms taking into account relativistic and resonance effects. When an
atom is exposed to an intense x-ray pulse generated by an x-ray free-electron
laser (XFEL), it is ionized to a highly charged ion via a sequence of
single-photon ionization and accompanying relaxation processes, and its final
charge state is limited by the last ionic state that can be ionized by a
single-photon ionization. If x-ray multiphoton ionization involves deep
inner-shell electrons in heavy atoms, energy shifts by relativistic effects
play an important role in ionization dynamics, as pointed out in [Phys.\ Rev.\
Lett.\ \textbf{110}, 173005 (2013)]. On the other hand, if the x-ray beam has a
broad energy bandwidth, the high-intensity x-ray pulse can drive resonant
photo-excitations for a broad range of ionic states and ionize even beyond the
direct one-photon ionization limit, as first proposed in [Nature\ Photon.\
\textbf{6}, 858 (2012)]. To investigate both relativistic and resonance
effects, we extend the \textsc{xatom} toolkit to incorporate relativistic
energy corrections and resonant excitations in x-ray multiphoton ionization
dynamics calculations. Charge-state distributions are calculated for Xe atoms
interacting with intense XFEL pulses at a photon energy of 1.5~keV and 5.5~keV,
respectively. For both photon energies, we demonstrate that the role of
resonant excitations in ionization dynamics is altered due to significant
shifts of orbital energy levels by relativistic effects. Therefore it is
necessary to take into account both effects to accurately simulate multiphoton
multiple ionization dynamics at high x-ray intensity.

wave functions localized in different layers which can be dynamically modified
by applying a time changeable in-plane magnetic field. Results of
time-dependent DFT calculations performed for a bilayer nanowire confining many
electrons show that the effect of such magnetic hybridization relies on tilting
of electrons' energy subbands, to the left or to the right, depending on a sign
of time derivative of oscillating magnetic field due to the Faraday law.
Consequently, the tilted subbands become a source of charge flow along the
wire. Strength of such magneto-induced current oscillations may achieve even
$0.6\mu\textrm{A}$ but it depends on duration of magnetic pulse as well as on
charge density confined in nanowire which has to be unequally distributed

both generate and modify the facial image from high-level semantic attributes.
Our key idea is to formulate a Semi-Latent Facial Attribute Space (SL-FAS) to
systematically learn relationship between user-defined and latent attributes,
as well as between those attributes and RGB imagery. As part of this newly
formulated space, we propose a new model --- SL-GAN which is a specific form of
Generative Adversarial Network. Finally, we present an iterative training

case that $b$ belongs to the Lebesgue space
$L^{l}\left(0,T;L^{q}\left(\mathbb{R}^{n}\right)\right)$. The regularity of
weak solutions to the parabolic equation $L_{t}u=0$ depends critically on the
value of the parabolic exponent $\gamma=\frac{2}{l}+\frac{n}{q}$. Without the
divergence-free condition on $b$, the regularity of weak solutions has been
established when $\gamma\leq1$, and the heat kernel estimate has been obtained
as well, except for the case that $l=\infty,q=n$. The regularity of weak
solutions was deemed not true for the critical case
$L^{\infty}\left(0,T;L^{n}\left(\mathbb{R}^{n}\right)\right)$ for a general
$b$, while it is true for the divergence-free case, and a written proof can be
deduced from the results in [Semenov, 2006]. One of the results obtained in the

supercritical cases and for vector fields $b$ which are divergence-free. We
will prove the best possible lower and upper bounds for the fundamental

divergence-free condition enters the study of parabolic equations rather
recently, mainly due to the discovery of the compensated compactness. The
interest for the study of such parabolic equations comes from its connections
with Leray's weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and the Taylor

we derive the probability of which BS tier a typical UE should associate to and
the expression of the activated BS density in each tier. Based on such results,
analytical expressions for the coverage probability and the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) in each tier are also obtained. The impact of the IMC on the
performance of all BS tiers is shown to be significant. In particular, there
will be a surplus of BSs when the BS density in each tier exceeds the UE
density, and the overall coverage probability as well as the ASE continuously
increase when the BS IMC is applied. Such finding is distinctively different
from that in existing work. Thus, our result sheds new light on the design and

system aimed for choosing representatives bodies, such as parliaments, based on
preferences of a population of voters over individual candidates. Each problem
in our framework is associated with a vector of weights: we show that the
approximability of the problem depends on structural properties of these

the objective function interpreted in a multiwinner election setup reflects to
the well-known Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule.

the problem allows constant factor approximation. This is surprising since the

we propose is based on dependent rounding [Srinivasan, FOCS'01] applied to the
solution of a natural LP-relaxation of the problem. The rounding process is
well known to produce distributions over integral solutions satisfying Negative
Correlation (NC), which is usually sufficient for the analysis of approximation
guarantees offered by rounding procedures. In our analysis, however, we need to
use the fact that the carefully implemented rounding process satisfies a
stronger property, called Negative Association (NA), which allows us to apply

applicability of plasma-wakefield accelerators. By developing an analytical
model which incorporates the evolution of the hose instability over long
propagation distances, this work demonstrates that the inherent drive-beam
energy loss, along with an initial beam energy spread detune the betatron
oscillations of beam electrons, and thereby mitigate the instability. It is
also shown that tapered plasma profiles can strongly reduce initial hosing
seeds. Hence, we demonstrate that the propagation of a drive beam can be
stabilized over long propagation distances, paving the way for the acceleration
of high-quality electron beams in plasma-wakefield accelerators. We find
excellent agreement between our models and particle-in-cell simulations.

production of enzymatic vs. non-enzymatic biomass components from a single

linear growth, where only the non-enzymatic component is produced, and
exponential growth with only enzymatic components being produced. Using
Pontryagin's maximum principle, we derive the optimal growth trajectory
depending on the model's parameters. It turns out that depending on the
parameters, either a single growth mode is optimal, or otherwise the optimal
solution is a concatenation of exponential growth with linear growth.
Importantly, on the short time scale, the choice of growth mode depends only on
catalytic rate constants and biomass weights of the two component types,
whereas on longer time scales, where the nutrient amount becomes limiting, also
the yield coefficients play a role.

consists of creating half the offspring with a mutation rate that is twice the
current mutation rate and the other half with half the current rate. The
mutation rate is then updated to the rate used in that subpopulation which
contains the best offspring.
  We analyze how the $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm with this
self-adjusting mutation rate optimizes the OneMax test function. We prove that
this dynamic version of the $(1+\lambda)$ EA finds the optimum in an expected
optimization time (number of fitness evaluations) of
$O(n\lambda/\log\lambda+n\log n)$. This time is asymptotically smaller than the
optimization time of the classic $(1+\lambda)$ EA. Previous work shows that
this performance is best-possible among all $\lambda$-parallel mutation-based
unbiased black-box algorithms.
  This result shows that the new way of adjusting the mutation rate can find
optimal dynamic parameter values on the fly. Since our adjustment mechanism is
simpler than the ones previously used for adjusting the mutation rate and does
not have parameters itself, we are optimistic that it will find other
applications.

The Bayesian de-blending tool, XID+, currently provides one of the best ways to
de-confuse deep Herschel SPIRE images, using a flat flux density prior. This
work is to demonstrate that existing multi-wavelength data sets can be
exploited to improve XID+ by providing an informed prior, resulting in more
accurate and precise extracted flux densities. Photometric data for galaxies in
the COSMOS field were used to constrain spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
using the fitting tool CIGALE. These SEDs were used to create Gaussian prior
estimates in the SPIRE bands for XID+. The multi-wavelength photometry and the
extracted SPIRE flux densities were run through CIGALE again to allow us to
compare the performance of the two priors. Inferred ALMA flux densities
(F$^i$), at 870$\mu$m and 1250$\mu$m, from the best fitting SEDs from the
second CIGALE run were compared with measured ALMA flux densities (F$^m$) as an
independent performance validation. Similar validations were conducted with the
SED modelling and fitting tool MAGPHYS and modified black body functions to
test for model dependency. We demonstrate a clear improvement in agreement
between the flux densities extracted with XID+ and existing data at other
wavelengths when using the new informed Gaussian prior over the original
uninformed prior. The residuals between F$^m$ and F$^i$ were calculated. For
the Gaussian prior, these residuals, expressed as a multiple of the ALMA error
($\sigma$), have a smaller standard deviation, 7.95$\sigma$ for the Gaussian
prior compared to 12.21$\sigma$ for the flat prior, reduced mean, 1.83$\sigma$
compared to 3.44$\sigma$, and have reduced skew to positive values, 7.97
compared to 11.50. These results were determined to not be significantly model
dependent. This results in statistically more reliable SPIRE flux densities.

fragments. There are many different physical and numerical explanations for
fragmentation, but simulations often show a non-convergent behavior for ever
better resolution.
  Aims. We investigate the influence of different numerical limiters in Godunov
type schemes on the fragmentation boundary in self- gravitating disks.
  Methods. We compare the linear and non-linear outcome in two-dimensional
shearingsheet simulations using the VANLEER and the SUPERBEE limiter.
  Results. We show that choosing inappropriate limiting functions to handle
shock-capturing in Godunov type schemes can lead to an overestimation of the
surface density in regions with shallow density gradients. The effect amplifies
itself on timescales comparable to the dynamical timescale even at high
resolutions. This is exactly the environment, where clumps are expected to
form. The effect is present without, but scaled up by, self-gravity and also
does not depend on cooling. Moreover it can be backtracked to a well known
effect called oversteepening. If the effect is also observed in the linear
case, the fragmentation limit is shifted to larger values of the critical
cooling timescale.

deep convolutional neural networks and affordable eye trackers. There exist
several approaches to recognize image pleasantness: (1) computer vision, and
(2) psychophysical signals. For natural images, computer vision approaches have
not been as successful as for abstract paintings and is lagging behind the
psychophysical signals like eye movements. Despite better results, the
scalability of eye movements is adversely affected by the sensor cost. While
the introduction of affordable sensors have helped the scalability issue by
making the sensors more accessible, the application of such sensors in a
loosely controlled human-computer interaction setup is not yet studied for
affective image tagging. On the other hand, deep convolutional neural networks
have boosted the performance of vision-based techniques significantly in recent
years. To investigate the current status in regard to affective image tagging,
we (1) introduce a new eye movement dataset using an affordable eye tracker,
(2) study the use of deep neural networks for pleasantness recognition, (3)
investigate the gap between deep features and eye movements. To meet these
ends, we record eye movements in a less controlled setup, akin to daily
human-computer interaction. We assess features from eye movements, visual
features, and their combination. Our results show that (1) recognizing natural
image pleasantness from eye movement under less restricted setup is difficult
and previously used techniques are prone to fail, and (2) visual class
categories are strong cues for predicting pleasantness, due to their
correlation with emotions, necessitating careful study of this phenomenon. This
latter finding is alerting as some deep learning approaches may fit to the
class category bias.

methods, accurate evaluation of singular and nearly singular integrals in layer

local expansion centered at some distance from the source boundary. In this
paper we introduce an extension of the QBX scheme in 2D denoted AQBX - adaptive
quadrature by expansion - which combines QBX with an algorithm for automated
selection of parameters, based on a target error tolerance. A key component in
this algorithm is the ability to accurately estimate the numerical errors in
the coefficients of the expansion. Combining previous results for flat panels
with a procedure for taking the panel shape into account, we derive such error
estimates for arbitrarily shaped boundaries in 2D that are discretized using
panel-based Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Applying our scheme to numerical
solutions of Dirichlet problems for the Laplace and Helmholtz equations, and
also for solving these equations, we find that the scheme is able to satisfy a
given target tolerance to within an order of magnitude, making it useful for
practical applications. This represents a significant simplification over the
original QBX algorithm, in which choosing a good set of parameters can be hard.

estimates of unemployment incidence cannot be released for Local Labor Market
Areas. These are unplanned domains defined as clusters of municipalities; many
are out-of-sample areas and the majority is characterized by a small sample
size, which render direct estimates inadequate. The Empirical Best Predictor
represents an appropriate, model-based, alternative. However, for non-Gaussian
responses, its computation and the computation of the analytic approximation to
its Mean Squared Error require the solution of (possibly) multiple integrals
that, generally, have not a closed form. To solve the issue, Monte Carlo
methods and parametric bootstrap are common choices, even though the
computational burden is a non trivial task. In this paper, we propose a
Semi-Parametric Empirical Best Predictor for a (possibly) non-linear mixed
effect model by leaving the distribution of the area-specific random effects
unspecified and estimating it from the observed data. This approach is known to
lead to a discrete mixing distribution which helps avoid unverifiable
parametric assumptions and heavy integral approximations. We also derive a
second-order, bias-corrected, analytic approximation to the corresponding Mean
Squared Error. Finite sample properties of the proposed approach are tested via
a large scale simulation study. Furthermore, the proposal is applied to

with vortex topologic theory and quantum dynamic models with experimental data
considered to justify the relation between superconductivity phenomena and
magnetic monopole properties. We find that the electromagnetic energy of
magnetic monopole is in agreement with vortex energy in topological theory and
it can get close to thermal energy at high temperature. These models suggest
the superconductivity is related to the mobile monopole or vortices. we show
that the electrical permittivity ($\epsilon$) and magnetic permeability ($\mu$)
of matter have a key role in the superconductive properties.

spin polarization of the conduction electrons induced by the oscillations in
the non-uniform magnetization forced by the electric field of the

the generation of the double frequency spin current. This spin current is
converted to the electric current via the inverse Spin Hall effect, and the
double-frequency electric current emits the second harmonic radiation.

In fact, clothing correlates with personality traits, both in terms of

that it represents a discriminative factor to differentiate among diverse

through the reaction between C$^+(^2P)$ and H$_2(\nu_{\rm H_2}=1, 2)$, while
the collisional (de)excitation and destruction of CH$^+$ is due to collisions
with hydrogen atoms and free electrons. State-to-state and
initial-state-specific rate coefficients are computed in the kinetic
temperature range 10-3000~K for the inelastic, exchange, abstraction and
dissociative recombination processes using accurate potential energy surfaces
and the best scattering methods. Good agreement, within a factor of 2, is found
between the experimental and theoretical thermal rate coefficients, except for
the reaction of CH$^+$ with H atoms at kinetic temperatures below 50~K. The
full set of collisional and chemical data are then implemented in a radiative

known as Induced Subgraph Isomorphism (for the pattern graph $F$), is solvable
in time $O(n^{W[F]})$. Motivated by this fact, we are interested in determining

quantifier depth 3, where $K_3+e$ denotes the paw graph. This provides an
example of a graph $F$ with $W[F]$ strictly less than the number of vertices in

the paw graph and its complement. If $F$ is a graph on $t$ vertices, we prove a
general lower bound $W[F]>(1/2-o(1))t$, where the function in the little-o

parameter $W^*[F]\le W[F]$, which is defined as the minimum $k$ such that
$I(F)$ is definable in the infinitary logic $L^k_{\infty\omega}$. We show that
$W^*[F]$ can be strictly less than $W[F]$. Specifically, $W^*[P_4]=3$ for $P_4$

by the low diffusivity of the O vacancy. Present first-principle
Density-Functional-Theory calculations show that the slow migration of the
doubly positively charged O vacancy at high temperature cannot be solely caused
by the ground-state migration energy but by the contribution of phonon
excitations to the free migration energy. With increasing temperature, the
effective barrier for oxygen vacancy migration increases. At about 1000K, which
is the operating temperature of fuel cells, the calculated O vacancy
diffusivity is more than one order of magnitude lower than that determined
using solely the ground-state migration barrier. The calculated diffusivity

backscatter devices (BDs) (e.g., sensors, tags) to modulate their information
bits over ambient RF carriers in an over-the-air manner. This technology also
called ""modulation in the air"", thus has emerged as a promising solution to
achieve green communications for future Internet-of-Things. This paper studies
an AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC
system from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel
joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol
period is designed to be in general an integer multiplication of the OFDM
symbol period, and the waveform for BD bit `0' maintains the same state within
a BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit `1' has a state transition in
the middle of each OFDM symbol period within a BD symbol period. In the
receiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the
direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient
OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a
single-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover
the BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form
expression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test
statistic, and derive the optimal detector. Moreover, practical timing
synchronization algorithms are proposed, and we also analyze the effect of
various system parameters on the system performance. Finally, extensive
numerical results are provided to verify that the proposed transceiver design
can improve the system bit-error-rate (BER) performance and the operating range
significantly, and achieve much higher data rate, as compared to the
conventional design.

the drift of grains through the ambient gas. We first calculate mechanical
torques (MATs) resulting from specular reflection of gas atoms for seven
irregular shapes: one shape of mirror symmetry, three highly irregular shapes
(HIS), and three weakly irregular shapes (WIS). We find that the grain with
mirror symmetry experiences negligible MATs due to its mirror-symmetry
geometry. Three highly irregular shapes can produce strong MATs which exhibit
some generic properties as radiative torques, while three weakly irregular
shapes produce less efficient MATs. We then study grain alignment by MATs for
the different angles between the drift velocity and the ambient magnetic field,
for paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains assuming efficient internal
relaxation. We find that for HIS grains, MATs can align subsonically drifting
grains in the same way as radiative torques, with low-J and high-J attractors.
For supersonic drift, MATs can align grains with low-J and high-J attractors,
analogous to radiative alignment by anisotropic radiation. We also show that
the joint action of MATs and magnetic torques in grains with iron inclusions
can lead to perfect MAT alignment. Our results point out the potential
importance of MAT alignment for HIS grains predicted by the analytical model of
Lazarian \& Hoang (2007b), although more theoretical and observational studies
are required due to uncertainty in the shape of interstellar grains. We outline
astrophysical environments where MAT alignment is potentially important.

nucleus. That is, regardless of whether the core nucleus is spherical or
deformed, each hypernuclear state is dominated by the single configuration of
the $\Lambda$ particle in the $s_{1/2}$ state ($\Lambda s_{1/2}$) coupled to
one core state of the ground band. In contrast, the low-lying negative-parity

problems involving coupled multi-physical response, especially in the linear
case for which boundary-only formulations are possible. This paper presents the
integral equation formulation for size-dependent linear thermoelastic response
of solids under steady state conditions. The formulation is based upon
consistent couple stress theory, which features a skew-symmetric couple-stress
pseudo-tensor. For general anisotropic thermoelastic material, there is not
only thermal strain deformation, but also thermal mean curvature deformation.
Interestingly, in this size-dependent multi-physics model, the thermal
governing equation is independent of the deformation. However, the mechanical
governing equations depend on the temperature field. First, thermal and
mechanical weak forms and reciprocal theorems are developed for this general
size-dependent thermoelastic theory. Then, an integral equation formulation for
the three-dimensional isotropic case is derived, along with the corresponding
singular infinite space fundamental solutions or kernel functions. Remarkably,
for isotropic materials within this theory, there is no thermal mean curvature
deformation, and the thermoelastic effect is solely the result of thermal
strain deformation. As a result, the size-dependent behavior is specified
entirely by a single characteristic length scale parameter, while the thermal
coupling is defined in terms of the thermal expansion coefficient, as in the
classical theory of steady state isotropic thermoelasticity. This
simplification permits the development of the required kernel functions from
previously defined fundamental solutions for isotropic media.

dynamics in which agents evaluate alternative views on the basis of the social
feedback obtained on expressing them. High support of the favored opinion in
the social environment, is treated as a positive feedback which reinforces the
value associated to this opinion. In connected networks of sufficiently high
modularity, different groups of agents can form strong convictions of competing
opinions. Linking the social feedback process to standard equilibrium concepts
we analytically characterize sufficient conditions for the stability of
bi-polarization. While previous models have emphasized the polarization effects
of deliberative argument-based communication, our model highlights an affective
experience-based route to polarization, without assumptions about negative
influence or bounded confidence.

addressed in terms of harmonic contrast reduction. A unique compact closed-form
solution for a surface impedance $Z_s(m,kr)$ is found in a straightforward
manner and without any approximation as a function of the harmonic index $m$
(scattering mode to suppress) and of the frequency regime $kr$ (product of
wavenumber $k$ and radius $r$ of the cloaked system) at any frequency regime.
In the quasi-static limit, mantle cloaking is obtained as a particular case for
$kr \ll 1$ and $m=0$. In addition, beyond quasi-static regime, impedance
coatings for a selected dominant harmonic wave can be designed with proper
dispersive behaviour, resulting in improved reduction levels and harmonic
filtering capability.

coefficient, an improved fixed-point iterative method is proposed to retrieve
the absorption coefficient for its cheap computational cost. And we prove the
convergence. To retrieve two coefficients simultaneously, Barzilai-Borwein (BB)
method is applied. Since the reconstruction of optical coefficients involves
the solution of original and adjoint RTEs in the framework of optimization, an
efficient solver with high accuracy is improved from~\cite{Gao}. Simulation
experiments illustrate that the improved fixed-point iterative method and the

successful machine learning technologies for image and video processing. The
most computationally intensive parts of CNNs are the convolutional layers,
which convolve multi-channel images with multiple kernels. A common approach to
implementing convolutional layers is to expand the image into a column matrix
(im2col) and perform Multiple Channel Multiple Kernel (MCMK) convolution using
an existing parallel General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) library. This im2col
conversion greatly increases the memory footprint of the input matrix and
reduces data locality.
  In this paper we propose a new approach to MCMK convolution that is based on
General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), but not on im2col. Our algorithm
eliminates the need for data replication on the input thereby enabling us to
apply the convolution kernels on the input images directly. We have implemented
several variants of our algorithm on a CPU processor and an embedded ARM
processor. On the CPU, our algorithm is faster than im2col in most cases.

water using laboratory mice, motivated by the need to understand the origin of
chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology is examined within our
understanding of the hydration of ions and proteins. Qualitative considerations
based on Hofmeister-type action of these ions, as well as quantitative
electrochemical models for the Gibbs free-energy change for ion-pair formation
are used to explain why Cd$^{2+}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and water hardness
due to Mg$^{2+}$ ions (but not Ca$^{2+}$) can be expected to be more
nephrotoxic, while AsO$_3^{3-}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and hardness may be
expected to be less nephrotoxic. The analysis is applied to a variety of ionic
species typically found in water to predict their likely combined
electro-chemical action. These results clarify the origins of chronic kidney
disease in the north-central province of Sri Lanka. The conclusion is further
strengthened by a study of the dietary load of Cd and As, where the dietary
loads are found to be safe, especially when the mitigating effects of
micronutrient ionic forms of Zn and Se, as well as corrections for
bio-availability are taken in to account. The resulting aetiological picture
supports the views that F$^-$, Cd$^{2+}$ (to a lesser extent), and Mg$^{2+}$
ions found in stagnant household well water act together with enhanced
toxicity, becoming the most likely causative factor of the disease. Similar
incidence of CKDu found in other tropical climates may have similar geological
origins.
