  Action Coding","ICCV 2017 - accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human face exhibits an inherent hierarchy in its representations (i.e.,
holistic facial expressions can be encoded via a set of facial action units
(AUs) and their intensity). Variational (deep) auto-encoders (VAE) have shown
great results in unsupervised extraction of hierarchical latent representations
from large amounts of image data, while being robust to noise and other
undesired artifacts. Potentially, this makes VAEs a suitable approach for
learning facial features for AU intensity estimation. Yet, most existing
VAE-based methods apply classifiers learned separately from the encoded
features. By contrast, the non-parametric (probabilistic) approaches, such as
Gaussian Processes (GPs), typically outperform their parametric counterparts,
but cannot deal easily with large amounts of data. To this end, we propose a
novel VAE semi-parametric modeling framework, named DeepCoder, which combines
the modeling power of parametric (convolutional) and nonparametric (ordinal
GPs) VAEs, for joint learning of (1) latent representations at multiple levels
in a task hierarchy1, and (2) classification of multiple ordinal outputs. We
show on benchmark datasets for AU intensity estimation that the proposed
DeepCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, and related VAEs and
deep learning models.

dipoles is used in order to determine the Newton-Raphson basins of attraction

position as well as of the stability of the Lagrange points are monitored when
the value of the ratio $\lambda$ of the magnetic moments varies in predefined
intervals. The regions on the configuration $(x,y)$ plane occupied by the
basins of convergence are revealed using the multivariate version of the
Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The correlations between the basins of
attraction of the libration points and the corresponding number of iterations
needed for obtaining the desired accuracy are also illustrated. We perform a
thorough and systematic numerical investigation by demonstrating how the
dynamical quantity $\lambda$ influences the shape, the geometry and also the
degree of fractality of the attracting domains. Our numerical results strongly
indicate that the ratio $\lambda$ is indeed a very influential parameter in the
electromagnetic binary system.

  Alignment: The Approach of Shot-Noise Ratio","32 pages, to appear in IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimedia content especially videos is expected to dominate data traffic in
next-generation mobile networks. Caching popular content at the network edge
has emerged to be a solution for low-latency content delivery. Compared with
the traditional wireless communication, content delivery has a key
characteristic that many signals coexisting in the air carry identical popular
content. They, however, can interfere with each other at a receiver if their
modulation-and-coding (MAC) schemes are adapted to individual channels
following the classic approach. To address this issue, we present a novel idea
of content adaptive MAC (CAMAC) where adapting MAC schemes to content ensures
that all signals carry identical content are encoded using an identical MAC
scheme, achieving spatial MAC alignment. Consequently, interference can be
harnessed as signals, to improve the reliability of wireless delivery. In the
remaining part of the paper, we focus on quantifying the gain CAMAC can bring
to a content-delivery network using a stochastic-geometry model. Specifically,
content helpers are distributed as a Poisson point process, each of which
transmits a file from a content database based on a given popularity
distribution. It is discovered that the successful content-delivery probability
is closely related to the distribution of the ratio of two independent shot
noise processes, named a shot-noise ratio. The distribution itself is an open
mathematical problem that we tackle in this work. Using stable-distribution
theory and tools from stochastic geometry, the distribution function is derived
in closed form. Extending the result in the context of content-delivery
networks with CAMAC yields the content-delivery probability in different closed
forms. In addition, the gain in the probability due to CAMAC is shown to grow
with the level of skewness in the content popularity distribution.

fixed-budget version of the thresholding bandit problem (TBP), where the
objective is to identify a set of arms whose quality is above a threshold. A
key feature of AugUCB is that it uses both mean and variance estimates to
eliminate arms that have been sufficiently explored; to the best of our
knowledge this is the first algorithm to employ such an approach for the
considered TBP. Theoretically, we obtain an upper bound on the loss
(probability of mis-classification) incurred by AugUCB. Although UCBEV in
literature provides a better guarantee, it is important to emphasize that UCBEV
has access to problem complexity (whose computation requires arms' mean and
variances), and hence is not realistic in practice; this is in contrast to
AugUCB whose implementation does not require any such complexity inputs. We
conduct extensive simulation experiments to validate the performance of AugUCB.
Through our simulation work, we establish that AugUCB, owing to its utilization
of variance estimates, performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art
APT, CSAR and other non variance-based algorithms.

detection is followed by a comprehensive simulation of the readout electronics

requires to evaluate exponentially many word sense combinations (with branching
factors of up to 6 or more), probabilistic algorithms allow to find approximate
solution in a tractable time by sampling the search space. We find that CSA, GA

  (Montreal: Minkowski Institute Press, 2017)",,,"gr-qc physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Notoriously, the Einstein equations of general relativity have solutions in
which closed timelike curves (CTCs) occur. On these curves time loops back onto
itself, which has exotic consequences. However, in order to make time travel
stories consistent constraints have to be satisfied, which prevents seemingly
ordinary and plausible processes from occurring. This, and several other
""unphysical"" features, have motivated many authors to exclude solutions with
CTCs from consideration, e.g. by conjecturing a chronology protection law. In
this contribution we shall investigate the nature of one particular class of
exotic consequences of CTCs, namely those involving unexpected cases of
indeterminism or determinism. Indeterminism arises even against the backdrop of
the usual deterministic physical theories when CTCs do not cross spacelike
hypersurfaces outside of a limited CTC-region (such hypersurfaces fail to be
Cauchy surfaces). By contrast, a certain kind of determinism appears to arise
when an indeterministic theory is applied on a CTC: things cannot be different
from what they already were. We shall argue that on further consideration both
this indeterminism and determinism on CTCs turn out to possess analogues in
other, familiar areas of physics. CTC-indeterminism is close to the
epistemological indeterminism we know from statistical physics, while the
""fixedness"" typical of CTC-determinism is pervasive in physics. CTC-determinism
and CTC-indeterminism therefore do not provide incontrovertible grounds for
rejecting CTCs as conceptually inadmissible.

screened by separate conduction bands corresponding to parity-even and odd
superpositions of the metallic leads. By changing the frequency and amplitude
of the perturbation, one can tune the system to a quantum critical point with
symmetric coupling of the impurity to both channels. For the understanding of
the driven state, energy absorption from the drive must be considered: Although
the absorption at the impurity is balanced by the energy flow into the
conduction band, locally it leads to non-thermal distribution functions which
can have a detrimental effect on the Kondo physics. However, a numerical
simulation demonstrates that the absorption can be systematically suppressed at
a fixed value of the induced couplings by increasing the frequency, so that the
time-averaged dynamics in the driven one-channel Anderson model can be used to
study the critical behavior of the two-channel model.

environmental conditions on the rotational regulation.
  We investigate the rotational properties of candidate members of the young
massive association Cygnus OB2. The Stetson variability index, Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, Saunders statistics, string/rope length method, and visual
verification of folded light curves were applied to select 1224 periodic
variable stars. Completeness and contamination of the periodic sample was
derived from Monte Carlo simulations, out of which 894 periods were considered
reliable. Our study was considered reasonably complete for periods from 2 to 30
days.
  The general rotational scenario seen in other young regions is confirmed by
Cygnus OB2 period distributions, with disked stars rotating on average slower
than non-disked stars. A mass-rotation dependence was also verified, but as in
NGC 6530, lower mass stars are rotating on average slower than higher mass
stars, with an excess of slow rotators among the lower mass population. The
effect of the environment on the rotational properties of the association was
investigated by re-analysing the results while taking into account the incident
UV radiation arising from O stars in the association. Results compatible with
the disk-locking scenario were verified for stars with low UV incidence, but no
statistical significant relation between rotation and disk presence was
verified for stars with high UV incidence suggesting that massive stars can
have an important role on regulating the rotation of nearby low mass stars.

logarithmic factors involving the dimension of the input matrix and the size of

smallest entries of the optimal scalings. This implies that our algorithms run
in nearly-linear time whenever $\kappa$ is quasi-polynomial, which includes, in

by providing a separate algorithm that uses an interior-point method and runs

could deviate from its Standard Model value in weakly coupled models, we study
both theoretical and phenomenological constraints. As a first step, we discuss
this question by modifying the Standard Model using effective operators.
Considering constraints from vacuum stability and perturbativity, we show that
only the latter can be reliably assessed in a model-independent way. We then
focus on UV models which receive constraints from Higgs coupling measurements,
electroweak precision tests, vacuum stability and perturbativity. We find that
the interplay of current measurements with perturbativity already exclude
self-coupling modifications above a factor of few with respect to the Standard
Model value.

  We address the general scaling problem as well as some important special

then we can solve the problem in total complexity $\tilde{O}(m + n^{4/3})$.
This greatly improves on the best known previous results, which were either
$\tilde{O}(n^4)$ or $O(m n^{1/2}/\varepsilon)$.

an initially flat surface and with a given angle distribution. This process
gives rise to a rough interface after some time of deposition. We performed
Monte Carlo simulations and, by changing the angle of deposition, we observed a
transition from the random deposition (RD) universality class to the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We measured the usual scaling

non-perpendicularly to the substrate, can change the universality class in a
discrete atomistic random deposition model. When particles are deposited with
an angle of $45^{\circ}$ in relation to the surface, the same values of the

is significant evolution in the shape and central wavelength of the line
profiles over the course of our observations, such that at early times the
lines are broad and redshifted, while at later times the lines are
significantly narrower and peak near the wavelengths of their corresponding
atomic transitions. Like ASASSN-14li, but unlike N-rich quasars, iPTF16fnl
shows neither MgII$\lambda 2798$\AA\ nor CIII]$\lambda 1909$\AA\ emission

that the complex HeII profiles observed in the optical spectra of many TDEs are
in part due to the presence of NIII and CIII Wolf-Rayet features, which can
potentially serve as probes of the far-UV when space-based observations are not
possible. Finally, we use Swift XRT and UVOT observations to place strong
limits on the X-ray emission and determine the characteristic temperature,
radius, and luminosity of the emitting material. We find that iPTF16fnl is

similar to observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and LSST. We
assess model performance with the area under the curve (AUC) of a Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Models trained on 10,000 lens and
non-lens containing images images exhibit an AUC of 0.975 for an HST-like
sample, 0.625 for one exposure of LSST, and 0.809 for 10-year mock LSST
observations. Performance appears to continually improve with the training set
size. Models trained on fewer images perform better in absence of the lens
galaxy light. However, with larger training data sets, information from the
lens galaxy actually improves model performance, indicating that HOG captures
much of the morphological complexity of the arc finding problem. We test our
classifier on data from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey and find that small scale
image features reduces the efficiency of our trained model. However, these
preliminary tests indicate that some parameterizations of HOG can compensate
for differences between observed mock data. One example best-case
parameterization results in an AUC of 0.6 in the F814 filter image with other
parameterization results equivalent to random performance.

suggesting that the ejecta morphology is likely elongated. The difference of
the CO and SiO line profiles is consistent with hydrodynamic simulations, which
show that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities cause mixing of gas, with heavier
elements much more disturbed, making more elongated structure. We obtained
isotopologue ratios of 28SiO/29SiO>13, 28SiO/30SiO>14, and 12CO/13CO>21, with
the most likely limits of 28SiO/29SiO>128, 28SiO/30SiO>189. Low 29Si and 30Si
abundances in SN 1987A are consistent with nucleosynthesis models that show
inefficient formation of neutron-rich isotopes in a low metallicity
environment, such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The deduced large mass of HCO+
(~5x10^-6 Msun) and small SiS mass (<6x10^-5 Msun) might be explained by some
mixing of elements immediately after the explosion. The mixing might have
caused some hydrogen from the envelope to sink into carbon and oxygen-rich
zones after the explosion, enabling the formation of a substantial mass of
HCO+. Oxygen atoms may have penetrated into silicon and sulphur zones,
suppressing formation of SiS. Our ALMA observations open up a new window to
investigate chemistry, dynamics and explosive-nucleosynthesis in supernovae.

address several of its problems, namely to explain dark matter, the
matter-antimatter asymmetry, or to improve the stability of the SM up to the

loop-corrections in BSM models with an arbitrary number of scalar singlets. We
then apply our method to a real and to a complex scalar singlet models. We
assess the importance of the one-loop radiative corrections first by computing
them for a tree level mixing sum constraint, and then for the main Higgs
production process $gg \to H$. We conclude that, for the currently allowed

results on the conductivities. In the simplest model, we find that the
conductivities do not track the doping evolution of the Hall coefficient, in
contrast to recent experimental findings. We propose a doping dependent
scattering rate, possibly due to quenched short-range charge fluctuations below
optimal doping, to consistently describe both the Hall data and the
longitudinal conductivities.

the weaker cycle 24. However, our analysis reveals an extremely complex and
diverse situation. For instance, there exists very limited commonality for
periods of less than one year. The few exceptions are the periods of 3.1--3.2
months found in the global occurrence rates of CMEs and in the sunspot area

periods of $\approx$1 and $\approx$2 years are more wide spread among the

two co-evolving populations simultaneously by using different scalarizing

the same region of the Pareto front, we stably match these two co-evolving
populations into one-one solution pairs according to their working regions of

recognition assumes that the sample's features (usually, i-vectors) are given
by a sum of three terms: a term that depends on the speaker identity, a term
that models the within-speaker variability and is assumed independent across
samples, and a final term that models any remaining variability and is also
independent across samples. In this work, we propose a generalization of this
model where the within-speaker variability is not necessarily assumed
independent across samples but dependent on another discrete variable. This
variable, which we call the channel variable as in the standard PLDA approach,
could be, for example, a discrete category for the channel characteristics, the
language spoken by the speaker, the type of speech in the sample
(conversational, monologue, read), etc. The value of this variable is assumed
to be known during training but not during testing. Scoring is performed, as in
standard PLDA, by computing a likelihood ratio between the null hypothesis that
the two sides of a trial belong to the same speaker versus the alternative
hypothesis that the two sides belong to different speakers. The two likelihoods
are computed by marginalizing over two hypothesis about the channels in both
sides of a trial: that they are the same and that they are different. This way,
we expect that the new model will be better at coping with same-channel versus
different-channel trials than standard PLDA, since knowledge about the channel
(or language, or speech style) is used during training and implicitly
considered during scoring.

detected a double MS that has not been detected in previous observations of NGC

find the two RGB branches observed in C generally exhibit different abundance
characteristics in a variety of elements (e.g., Ba, Na, and O) and in CN band
strengths, but no single element can define the two RGB branches. However,
simultaneously considering [Ba/Fe] or CN strengths with either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe],
or CN strengths can separate the two photometric RGB branches into two distinct
abundance groups. Matches of NGC 1851's published SGB and HB abundances to the
Washington photometry shows consistent characterizations of the MPs, which can
be defined as an O-rich/N-normal population and an O-poor/N-rich population.
Photometric synthesis for both the Washington C filter and the F336W filter
finds that these abundance characteristics, with appropriate variations in He,
can reproduce for both filters the photometric observations in both the RGB and

existence of protein channels that transition between open and closed states
with voltage dependent rate constants. The Hodgkin-Huxley model assumes
infinitely many channels, so fluctuations in the number of open channels do not
affect the voltage. However, real neurons have finitely many channels which
lead to fluctuations in the membrane voltage and modify the timing of the
spikes, which may in turn lead to large changes in the degree of
synchronization. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, neurons in the

number of neurons in the network. The channel noise only affects the time it

second-order Stokes surface waves on deep water in the presence of surface
tension. This extension is used to evaluate interfacial impedance for Stokes
waves under the assumption that the waves are growing and hence the surface
waves are unsteady. Thus, the previous investigation of Sajjadi et al. (2014)
is further explored in that (i) the surface wave is unsteady and nonlinear, and
(ii) the effect of the water viscosity, which affects surface stresses, is
taken into account. The determination of energy-transfer parameter, from wind
to waves, are calculated through a turbulence closure model but it is shown the
contribution due to turbulent shear flow is some 20% lower than that obtained
previously. A derivation leading to an expression for the closed streamlines
(Kelvin cat-eyes), which arise in the vicinity of the critical height, is found
for unsteady surface waves. From this expression it is deduced that as waves
grow or decay, the cats-eye are no longer symmetrical. Also investigated is the
energy transfer from wind to short Stokes waves through the viscous Reynolds
stresses in the immediate neighborhood of the water surface. It is shown that
the resonance between the Tollmien-Schlichting waves for a given turbulent wind
velocity profile and the free-surface Stokes waves give rise to an additional
contribution to the growth of nonlinear surface waves.

high-resolution image stacks that pose challenges to routine approaches and are
difficult for a human to annotate to obtain ground truth data. We present a

including a moving line-of-sight, can be accelerated using Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) by decomposing the Legendre polynomials into products of
Cartesian vectors. Here, we present a faster, optimal means of using FFTs for
this measurement. We avoid redundancy present in the Cartesian decomposition by
using a spherical harmonic decomposition of the Legendre polynomials.
Consequently, our method is substantially faster: a given multipole of order
$\ell$ requires only $2\ell+1$ FFTs rather than the $(\ell+1)(\ell+2)/2$ FFTs
of the Cartesian approach. For the hexadecapole ($\ell = 4$), this translates
to $40\%$ fewer FFTs, with increased savings for higher $\ell$. The reduction
in wall-clock time enables the calculation of finely-binned wedges in
$P(k,\mu)$, obtained by computing multipoles up to a large $\ell_{\rm max}$ and
combining them. This transformation has a number of advantages. We demonstrate
that by using non-uniform bins in $\mu$, we can isolate plane-of-sky (angular)
systematics to a narrow bin at $\mu \simeq 0$ while eliminating the
contamination from all other bins. We also show that the covariance matrix of
clustering wedges binned uniformly in $\mu$ becomes ill-conditioned when
combining multipoles up to large values of $\ell_{\rm max}$, but that the
problem can be avoided with non-uniform binning. As an example, we present
results using $\ell_{\rm max}=16$, for which our procedure requires a factor of
3.4 fewer FFTs than the Cartesian method, while removing the first $\mu$ bin
leads only to a 7% increase in statistical error on $f \sigma_8$, as compared
to a 54% increase with $\ell_{\rm max}=4$.

the in-plane thermal conductivity Kr from a second measurement using the same
modulation frequency but with a smaller spot size, when the heat flow becomes
three-dimensional, and the signal is sensitive to both Kr and Kz. By choosing
the same modulation frequency for the two sets of measurements, we can avoid
potential artifacts introduced by the frequency-dependent Kz, which we have
found to be non-negligible, especially for some two-dimensional layered
materials like MoS2. After careful evaluation of the sensitivity of a series of

the many-body wave function. Natural orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the
one-body density matrix from a calculation using an initial single-particle

accelerating convergence of wave functions, energies, and other observables.

electromagnetic observables involving the M1 operator fully converge, while the

will first try to get served by the cheapest available resource in its window

the potential to lead to cascading overload events. Our main result shows that
setting prices so as to optimally handle the {\em expected} demand works well:
with high probability, when the actual demand is instantiated, the system is
stable and the expected value of the jobs served is very close to that of the

be adapted to show that any hereditary property of $2$-dimensional matrices
over a finite alphabet (where row and column order is not ignored) is strongly
testable. The first result generalizes the result of Alon and Shapira [FOCS'05,
SICOMP'08], who showed that any hereditary graph property (without vertex
order) is strongly testable. The second result answers and generalizes a
conjecture of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP'07] concerning testing of matrix

  The testability is proved by establishing a removal lemma for vertex-ordered

forbidden vertex-ordered graphs, and any $\epsilon > 0$, there exist $\delta >

$\mathcal{F}$-free contains at least $\delta n^{|F|}$ copies of some
$F\in\mathcal{F}$ (with the correct vertex order) where $|F|\leq k$. The proof
bridges the gap between techniques related to the regularity lemma, used in the
long chain of papers investigating graph testing, and string testing

Furthermore, the present theory can be used to estimate the amount of energy
transferred to each component of nonlinear surface waves on deep water from a
turbulent shear flow blowing over it. Finally, it is demonstrated that in the
presence of turbulent eddy viscosity the Miles (1957) critical layer does not
play an important role. Thus, it is concluded that in the limit of zero growth
rate the effect of the wave growth arises from the elevated critical layer by
finite turbulent diffusivity, so that the perturbed flow and the drag force is
determined by the asymmetric and sheltering flow in the surface shear layer and
its matched interaction with the upper region.

Accretion and drag lead to a transformation of an embedded object and its orbit
during a common envelope phase. We present two suites of simulations spanning a
range of density gradients and Mach numbers -- relevant for flow near the limb
of a stellar envelope to the deep interior. In one suite, we adopt an ideal gas
adiabatic exponent of $\gamma=5/3$, in the other, $\gamma=4/3$. We find that
coefficients of drag rise in flows with steeper density gradients and that
coefficients of drag and accretion are consistently higher in the more
compressible, $\gamma=4/3$ flow. We illustrate the impact of these newly
derived coefficients by integrating the inspiral of a secondary object through
the envelopes of $3M_\odot$ ($\gamma\approx5/3$) and $80M_\odot$
($\gamma\approx4/3$) giants. In these examples, we find a relatively rapid
initial inspiral because, near the stellar limb, dynamical friction drag is
generated mainly from dense gas focussed from deeper within the primary-star's
envelope. This rapid initial inspiral timescale carries potential implications
for the timescale of transients from early common envelope interaction.

lattice point lying inside a circle in terms of the radius of the circle. The
heuristic that the number of points is very nearly the area of the circle is
surprisingly accurate. In this work, we describe two variants of the Gauss
Circle problem that exhibit similar characteristics.
  The first variant concerns sums of Fourier coefficients of $\text{GL}(2)$
cusp forms. These sums behave very similarly to the error term in the Gauss
Circle problem. We introduce new Dirichlet series with coefficients that are
squares of partial sums of Fourier coefficients of cusp forms. We study the
meromorphic properties of these Dirichlet series and use these series to give
new perspectives on the mean square of the size of sums of these Fourier
coefficients.
  The second variant concerns the number of lattice points of bounded size on
one-sheeted hyperboloids. This problem is very similar to counting the number
of lattice points within a spheres of various dimensions, except with the
additional constraint of lying on a hyperboloid. It turns out that this problem
is equivalent to estimating sums of the shape $\sum r_d(n^2 + h)$, where
$r_d(m)$ is the number of representations of $m$ as a sum of $d$ squares. We
prove improved smoothed and sharp estimates of the second moment of these sums,

photoreceptors sensitive to various wavelengths of light are distributed
randomly across the retina. Mechanisms that underlie stochastic cell fate
specification have been analysed in detail in the Drosophila retina. In

largely conserved among flies such that the difference between the Drosophila

strengths, rather than requiring a rewiring of the regulatory network. We
present a simple stochastic model which, among its other predictions, is

feeds into an instance subnetwork. This subnetwork uses the initial
category-level segmentation, along with cues from the output of an object
detector, within an end-to-end CRF to predict instances. This part of our model
is dynamically instantiated to produce a variable number of instances per

the climatological transport patterns we report agree well with GoM kinematics

suggest that coastal regions previously identified as high-risk for pollution
impact, are regions of maximal attraction. Also, we show examples where cLCSs
are remarkably similar to transport patterns observed during the Deepwater

assumption. We present a synchronous state machine replication protocol that
commits a decision every 3 rounds in the common case. The key challenge is to
ensure quorum intersection at one honest replica. Our solution is to rely on
the synchrony assumption to form a post-commit quorum of size $2f+1$, which
intersects at $f+1$ replicas with any pre-commit quorums of size $f+1$. Our
protocol also solves synchronous authenticated Byzantine agreement in expected
8 rounds. The best previous solution (Katz and Koo, 2006) requires expected 24
rounds. Our protocols may be applied to build Byzantine fault tolerant systems
or improve cryptographic protocols such as cryptocurrencies when synchrony can
be assumed.

high variance, slow convergence, and inefficient exploration. In this work, we
introduce a maximum entropy policy optimization framework which explicitly
encourages parameter exploration, and show that this framework can be reduced
to a Bayesian inference problem. We then propose a novel Stein variational
policy gradient method (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods
and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved

inequalities) have found widespread application in the study of the behavior of
primitive quantum Markov semigroups. The classical counterparts of these
inequalities are related to each other via a so-called transportation cost
inequality of order 2 (TC2). The latter inequality relies on the notion of a
metric on the set of probability distributions called the Wasserstein distance
of order 2. (TC2) in turn implies a transportation cost inequality of order 1
(TC1). In this paper, we introduce quantum generalizations of the inequalities
(TC1) and (TC2), making use of appropriate quantum versions of the Wasserstein
distances, one recently defined by Carlen and Maas and the other defined by us.
We establish that these inequalities are related to each other, and to the
quantum modified logarithmic Sobolev- and Poincar\'e inequalities, as in the
classical case. We also show that these inequalities imply certain
concentration-type results for the invariant state of the underlying semigroup.
We consider the example of the depolarizing semigroup to derive concentration
inequalities for any finite dimensional full-rank quantum state. These
inequalities are then applied to derive upper bounds on the error probabilities
occurring in the setting of finite blocklength quantum parameter estimation.

  approximation","25 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We justify rigorously an Isobe-Kakinuma model for water waves as a higher
order shallow water approximation in the case of a flat bottom. It is known
that the full water wave equations are approximated by the shallow water
equations with an error of order $O(\delta^2)$, where $\delta$ is a small
nondimensional parameter defined as the ratio of the mean depth to the typical
wavelength. The Green-Naghdi equations are known as higher order approximate
equations to the water wave equations with an error of order $O(\delta^4)$. In
this paper we show that the Isobe-Kakinuma model is a much higher order
approximation to the water wave equations with an error of order $O(\delta^6)$.

  room together",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the list-decodability, and related notions, of random linear
codes. This has been studied extensively before: there are many different
parameter regimes and many different variants. Previous works have used
complementary styles of arguments---which each work in their own parameter
regimes but not in others---and moreover have left some gaps in our
understanding of the list-decodability of random linear codes. In particular,
none of these arguments work well for list-recovery, a generalization of
list-decoding that has been useful in a variety of settings.
  In this work, we present a new approach, which works across parameter regimes
and further generalizes to list-recovery. Our main theorem can establish better
list-decoding and list-recovery results for low-rate random linear codes over
large fields; list-recovery of high-rate random linear codes; and it can
recover the rate bounds of Guruswami, Hastad, and Kopparty for constant-rate
random linear codes (although with large list sizes).

  Reconstruction","To be published in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we propose a framework for
reconstructing dynamic sequences of 2D cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images
from undersampled data using a deep cascade of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to accelerate the data acquisition process. In particular, we address
the case where data is acquired using aggressive Cartesian undersampling.
Firstly, we show that when each 2D image frame is reconstructed independently,
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 2D compressed sensing
approaches such as dictionary learning-based MR image reconstruction, in terms
of reconstruction error and reconstruction speed. Secondly, when reconstructing
the frames of the sequences jointly, we demonstrate that CNNs can learn
spatio-temporal correlations efficiently by combining convolution and data
sharing approaches. We show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and is capable of preserving anatomical structure more
faithfully up to 11-fold undersampling. Moreover, reconstruction is very fast:
each complete dynamic sequence can be reconstructed in less than 10s and, for
the 2D case, each image frame can be reconstructed in 23ms, enabling real-time
applications.

work, we explore observational scenarios for detecting strong equivalence

in-falling towards galaxy clusters, the supermassive black hole can be offset
from the galaxy center away from the direction of the cluster. Hence, well
resolved images of galaxies around nearby clusters can be used to identify the
displaced black hole via the star cluster bound to it. We show that this signal
is accessible with imaging surveys, both ongoing ones such as the Dark Energy

the central black hole in M~87 places new constraints on the galileon

disfavored for a large region of the parameter space. We also find a novel
phenomenon whereby the black hole can escape the galaxy completely in less than

  Butterfly Network",,,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Targeted attacks against network infrastructure are notoriously difficult to
guard against. In the case of communication networks, such attacks can leave
users vulnerable to censorship and surveillance, even when cryptography is
used. Much of the existing work on network fault-tolerance focuses on random
faults and does not apply to adversarial faults (attacks). Centralized networks
have single points of failure by definition, leading to a growing popularity in
decentralized architectures and protocols for greater fault-tolerance. However,
centralized network structure can arise even when protocols are decentralized.
Despite their decentralized protocols, the Internet and World-Wide Web have
been shown both theoretically and historically to be highly susceptible to
attack, in part due to emergent structural centralization. When single points
of failure exist, they are potentially vulnerable to non-technological (i.e.,
coercive) attacks, suggesting the importance of a structural approach to
attack-tolerance. We show how the assumption of partial trust transitivity,
while more realistic than the assumption underlying webs of trust, can be used
to quantify the effective redundancy of a network as a function of trust
transitivity. We also prove that the effective redundancy of the wrap-around
butterfly topology increases exponentially with trust transitivity and describe
a novel concurrent multipath routing algorithm for constructing paths to
utilize that redundancy. When portions of network structure can be dictated our
results can be used to create scalable, attack-tolerant infrastructures. More
generally, our results provide a theoretical formalism for evaluating the
effects of network structure on adversarial fault-tolerance.

at different nodes of a network to group within finite time at the same
location, not fixed in advanced.
  The extensive existing literature on this problem shares the same fundamental
assumption: the topological structure does not change during the rendezvous or
the gathering; this is true also for those investigations that consider faulty
nodes. In other words, they only consider static graphs. In this paper we start
the investigation of gathering in dynamic graphs, that is networks where the
topology changes continuously and at unpredictable locations.
  We study the feasibility of gathering mobile agents, identical and without
explicit communication capabilities, in a dynamic ring of anonymous nodes; the
class of dynamics we consider is the classic 1-interval-connectivity.
  We focus on the impact that factors such as chirality (i.e., a common sense
of orientation) and cross detection (i.e., the ability to detect, when
traversing an edge, whether some agent is traversing it in the other
direction), have on the solvability of the problem. We provide a complete
characterization of the classes of initial configurations from which the
gathering problem is solvable in presence and in absence of cross detection and
of chirality. The feasibility results of the characterization are all
constructive: we provide distributed algorithms that allow the agents to
gather. In particular, the protocols for gathering with cross detection are
time optimal. We also show that cross detection is a powerful computational
element.
  We prove that, without chirality, knowledge of the ring size is strictly more
powerful than knowledge of the number of agents; on the other hand, with
chirality, knowledge of n can be substituted by knowledge of k, yielding the
same classes of feasible initial configurations.

generation of 2e-2h states from 1e-2h states. One of the fundamental ways by
which electromagnetic (EM) waves interact with matter is by the generation of
excited electronic states. The interaction of EM field with atoms and molecules
is given by the field-dependent Hamiltonian. Excited states are intrinsically
transient in nature because they are not stationary states of the
field-dependent Hamiltonian. Consequently, the time-dependent dynamics of
excited states depend strongly on the external electromagnetic field. Starting
with the 1e-1h excitation in a general many-electron system, the system was
propagated in time using time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT). The
expression for time-dependent transition probability of
$(1\mathrm{e}-1\mathrm{h}) \rightarrow (2\mathrm{e}-2\mathrm{h})$ was evaluated
for a given time $t$ up to second-order in TDPT using diagrammatic techniques.
The derivation does not assume any a priori approximations to the
electron-electron correlation operator and presents the derivation of a
complete set of contributing diagrams associated with the full configuration
interaction wave function. The result from this work show that the calculation
of time-dependent transition probability can be factored into a
time-independent and time-dependent components. This is a significant outcome
for efficient computation of the time-dependent transition probability because
it allows for pre-computation of time-independent components before the start

an energy source frequently to recharge or replace its battery. We propose a

which the martensite-austenite transformation was stopped before completion in

higher temperatures than the ones previously recorded. In this paper, we study
a distinct memory fading effect which takes place by heating to a lower
temperature. This effect is reported in NiFeGa as polycrystalline ribbons, the
alloy being initially studied as bulk for which the thermal memory effect was
not found. If, after an initial incomplete heating up to T1 one performs a
second incomplete heating up to T2<T1, a new calorimetric dip appears at T2, as
expected, while less expected was that the dip corresponding to T1 reduces in
amplitude or even vanishes (if the arrest at T2 is repeated). The memory fading
effect is more clear for small differences T1-T2 and less obvious or absent for
large ones. The second part of the paper employs a statistical 2D model, which
associates the memorized temperatures with a depletion of certain martensite

$\nu_{18}$ nodal secular resonance, however the measured mean plane for the
40.3-42~au semi-major axis bin (just outside the $\nu_{18}$) is inclined
$\sim13^{\circ}$ to the predicted plane, a nearly 3-$\sigma$ discrepancy. For
the more distant Kuiper belt objects of semi-major axes in the range 50--80~au,

manner as a field-matter-bath coupling problem. First, the matter is described
by a cluster of Lorentz oscillators. Then the Maxwellian free field is coupled
to the Lorentz oscillators to describe a frequency dispersive medium. The
classical Hamiltonian is derived for such a coupled system, using Lorenz gauge
and decoupled scalar and vector potential formulations. The classical equations
of motion are derivable from the Hamiltonian using Hamilton equations. Then the
Hamiltonian is quantized with all the pertinent variables with the introduction
of commutators between the variables and their conjugate pairs. The quantum
equations of motion can be derived using the quantum Hamilton equations. It can
be shown that such a quantization scheme preserves the quantum commutators
introduced. Then a noise bath consisting of simple harmonic oscillators is
introduced and coupled to the matter consisting of Lorentz oscillators to
induce quantum loss. Langevin source emerges naturally in such a procedure, and
it can be shown that the results are consistent with the fluctuation
dissipation theorem, and the quantization procedure of Welsch's group. The
advantage of the present procedure is that no diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian is necessary to arrive at the quantum equations of motion. Finally,
we apply the quantization scheme to model spontaneous emission of a two-level
polarized atom placed above a dielectric cylinder that supports a bound state
in the continuum.

classical are about $\sim1$ mag brighter than pseudo bulges. Both bulges have
witnessed substantial growth, more than half of their present day stellar mass
has been gained since $z\sim1$. Their host discs have grown concurrently,
becoming progressively brighter in rest-frame I-band.
  The high redshift host discs of both pseudo and classical bulges are found to
be equally clumpy in rest-frame B-band. In the same band, we found that the
growth of classical bulges is accompanied by fading of their host discs - which
might be an indication of secular processes in action. However, both host disc
as well as the bulge have grown substantially in terms of stellar mass. Our
analysis suggests that, clump migration and secular processes alone can not
account for the bulge growth, since $z\sim1$, accretion and minor mergers would
be required.

includes two parts. The first part contains a trace norm and a block-diagonal

types of remote sensing images. The method that we are going to introduce in
this paper is to use virtual colors to colorize the gray-scale images of
satellite sensors. This approach helps us to have a better analysis on a sample
single-band image which has been taken by Landsat-8 (OLI) sensor (as a
multi-band sensor with natural color bands, its images' natural color can be
compared to synthetic color by our approach). A good feature of this method is
the original image reversibility in order to keep the suitable resolution of
output images.

implementations of BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded
optimization. A key difference with respect to existing high-performance
implementations of BLAS is that the computational performance is optimized for
small to medium scale matrices, i.e., for sizes up to a few hundred. BLASFEO
comes with three different implementations: a high-performance implementation
aiming at providing the highest performance for matrices fitting in cache, a
reference implementation providing portability and embeddability and optimized
for very small matrices, and a wrapper to standard BLAS and LAPACK providing
high-performance on large matrices. The three implementations of BLASFEO
together provide high-performance dense linear algebra routines for matrices
ranging from very small to large. Compared to both open-source and proprietary
highly-tuned BLAS libraries, for matrices of size up to about one hundred the
high-performance implementation of BLASFEO is about 20-30% faster than the
corresponding level 3 BLAS routines and 2-3 times faster than the corresponding

agreement with the cosmic accelerating expansion. In this regard, a coupling

the role of dark energy responsible for the current accelerating expansion
phase. Moreover, our study also shows that the radiation field may not be
coupled to the geometry in a non-minimal way which represents that the ordinary
energy-momentum conservation law is respected by the radiation source. It is
also shown that the primary inflationary era may be justified by the ability of
the geometry to couple to the energy-momentum source in an empty flat FRW
universe. In fact, this ability is independent of the existence of the
energy-momentum source and may compel the empty flat FRW universe to expand
exponentially. Finally, we consider a flat FRW universe field by a spatially
homogeneous scalar field evolving in potential $\mathcal{V}(\phi)$, and study
the results of applying the slow-roll approximation to the system which may
lead to an inflationary phase for the universe expansion.

  The interpretation has the property that Given a definition of the belief

  The interpretation is based on rough sets (in connection with decision

physical limitations - small sensor size, compact lenses and the lack of
specific hardware, - impede them to achieve the quality results of DSLR
cameras. In this work we present an end-to-end deep learning approach that
bridges this gap by translating ordinary photos into DSLR-quality images. We
propose learning the translation function using a residual convolutional neural
network that improves both color rendition and image sharpness. Since the
standard mean squared loss is not well suited for measuring perceptual image
quality, we introduce a composite perceptual error function that combines
content, color and texture losses. The first two losses are defined
analytically, while the texture loss is learned in an adversarial fashion. We
also present DPED, a large-scale dataset that consists of real photos captured
from three different phones and one high-end reflex camera. Our quantitative
and qualitative assessments reveal that the enhanced image quality is
comparable to that of DSLR-taken photos, while the methodology is generalized
to any type of digital camera.

molecular spectroscopy due to the large absorption of molecular vibrational
modes on one hand, and the ability to implement superior comb-based
spectroscopic modalities with increased speed, sensitivity and precision on the
other hand. Substantial advances in mid-infrared frequency comb generation have
been made in recent years based on nonlinear frequency conversion,
microresonator Kerr frequency combs, quantum cascade lasers and mode locking
regimes. Here we demonstrate a simple, yet effective method for the direct
generation of mid-infrared optical frequency combs in the region from
${2.5-4~\mu{\rm m}}$, i.e. ${2500-4000~{\rm cm}^{-1}}$ covering a large
fraction of the functional group region, directly from a conventional and
compact erbium-fiber-based femtosecond laser in the telecommunication band
(i.e. ${1.55~\mu{\rm m}}$). The wavelength conversion is based on dispersive
wave generation within the supercontinuum process in large-cross-section and
dispersion-engineered silicon nitride (${\rm Si_3N_4}$) waveguides. The
long-wavelength dispersive wave, with its position lithographically determined,
performs as a mid-infrared frequency comb, whose coherence is demonstrated via
optical heterodyne measurements. Such a simple and versatile approach to
mid-infrared frequency comb generation is suitable for spectroscopic
applications in the first mid-infrared atmospheric window. Moreover, the
compactness and simplicity of the approach have the potential to realize
compact dual-comb spectrometers. The generated combs have a fine teeth-spacing,
making them also suitable for gas phase analysis.

placed in a chamber open to the air create persistent luminiscent plumes most
easily visible when observed in the dark. These flows are strikingly similar to
the classical bioconvection pattern of aerotactic swimming bacteria, which
create an unstable stratification by swimming upwards to an air-water
interface, but they are a puzzle since the strain of $P.~phosphoreum$ used does
not express flagella and therefore cannot swim. Systematic experimentation with
suspensions of microspheres reveals that these flow patterns are driven not by
the bacteria but by the accumulation of salt at the air-water interface due to
evaporation of the culture medium; even at room temperature and humidity, and
physiologically relevant salt concentrations, the rate of water evaporation is
sufficient to drive convection patterns. A mathematical model is developed to
understand the mechanism of plume formation, and linear stability analysis as
well as numerical simulations were carried out to support the conclusions.
While evaporation-driven convection has not been discussed extensively in the
context of biological systems, these results suggest that the phenomenon may be
relevant in other systems, particularly those using microorganisms of limited
motility.

discs is a question of fundamental theoretical and observational importance. In
this work we investigate whether the dependence of the turbulent accretion disc
stress ($\alpha$) on the magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) is sufficiently sensitive
to induce thermal-viscous instability using 3D MHD simulations. We first
investigate whether the $\alpha$-Pm dependence, found by many previous authors,
has a physical or numerical origin by conducting a suite of local shearing-box
simulations. We find that a definite $\alpha$-Pm dependence persists when
simultaneously increasing numerical resolution and decreasing the absolute
values of both the viscous and resistive dissipation coefficients. This points
to a physical origin of the $\alpha$-Pm dependence. Using a further set of
simulations which include realistic turbulent heating and radiative cooling,
and by giving Pm a realistic physical dependence on the plasma temperature and
density, we demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Pm dependence is sufficiently strong
to lead to a local instability. We confirm that the instability manifests
itself as an unstable limit cycle by mapping the local thermal-equilibrium
curve of the disc. This is the first self-consistent MHD simulation
demonstrating the Pm instability from first principles. This result is
important because a physical Pm instability would lead to the global
propagation of heating and cooling fronts and a transition between disc states
on timescales compatible with the observed hard/soft state transitions in black
hole binaries.

happens in the parent compound $x$ = 0.0 as a function of pressure, we find a
surprising result that the non-Fermi liquid behavior persists over a nonzero

Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We investigate the detection rate according
to three information criteria and the delta chi^2. For the delta chi^2, the
effective number of degrees of freedom depends on the mission length. We find
that the choice of the Markov chain starting point can affect the quality of
the results; we therefore consider two limit possibilities: an ideal case, and
a very simple method that finds the starting point assuming circular orbits.
Using Jeffreys' scale of evidence, the fraction of false positives passing a
strong evidence criterion is < ~0.2% (0.6%) when considering a 5 yr (10 yr)
mission and using the Akaike information criterion or the Watanabe-Akaike
information criterion, and <0.02% (<0.06%) when using the Bayesian information

change is linear in two senses. Firstly, today's embedding vectors (= meaning)

T})$ gravity theory from a different perspective. Here, ${\sf T}$ denotes the
trace of energy-momentum tensor ({\sf EMT}) of matter fluids. The usual method
(as discussed in the literature) is to choose an $h({\sf T})$ function and then
solve for the resulted Friedman equations. Nevertheless, our aim here is,
without loss of generality, to reformulate a particular class of $f({\sf
R},{\sf T})$ gravity models in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is promoted by
an arbitrary function of the trace of {\sf EMT}. The strategy is the
redefinition of the equation of motion in terms of the components of an
effective fluid. We show that in this case the {\sf EMT} is automatically
conserved. As we shall see, adopting such a point of view (at least) in $f({\sf
R},{\sf T})$ gravity is accompanied by two significant points. On one hand,
$h({\sf T})$ function is chosen based upon a physical concept and on the other,
we clearly understand the overall or effective behavior of matter in terms of a
conserved effective fluid. To illustrate the idea, we study some models in
which different physical properties for the effective fluid is attributed to
each model. Particularly, we discuss models with constant effective density,
constant effective pressure and constant effective equation of state ({\sf
EoS}) parameter. Moreover, two models with a relation between the effective
density and the effective pressure will be considered. An elegant result is
that in $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ gravity, there is a possibility that a perfect
fluid could effectively behave as a modified Chaplygin gas with four free
parameters.

Corresponding hedging strategies arise as minimizers of a suitable coherent

many results concerning the local differential geometry of noncommutative tori

the evaluation of oscillatory integrals, so we make it the objective of this

for the symbol of a product of two pseudo-differential operators, we define the

relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-stage
attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can
also be easily interpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010

behind traditional cuisine: the Food-bridging hypothesis and its comparison
with the food-pairing hypothesis using the same dataset and graphical models
employed in the food-pairing study by Ahn et al. [Scientific Reports, 1:196
(2011)].
  The Food-bridging hypothesis assumes that if two ingredients do not share a
strong molecular or empirical affinity, they may become affine through a chain
of pairwise affinities. That is, in a graphical model as employed by Ahn et
al., a chain represents a path that joints the two ingredients, the shortest
path represents the strongest pairwise chain of affinities between the two
ingredients.
  Food-pairing and Food-bridging are different hypotheses that may describe
possible mechanisms behind the recipes of traditional cuisines. Food-pairing
intensifies flavour by mixing ingredients in a recipe with similar chemical
compounds, and food-bridging smoothes contrast between ingredients. Both
food-pairing and food-bridging are observed in traditional cuisines, as shown
in this work.
  We observed four classes of cuisines according to food-pairing and
food-bridging: (1) East Asian cuisines, at one extreme, tend to avoid
food-pairing as well as food-bridging; and (4) Latin American cuisines, at the
other extreme, follow both principles. For the two middle classes: (2)
Southeastern Asian cuisines, avoid food-pairing and follow food-bridging; and
(3) Western cuisines, follow food-pairing and avoid food-bridging.

transform-based function method is one of the most widely used techniques.
However, it is challenging to design a suit- able sparse representation to
express a transform-based func- tion group due to the complexity of seismic
data. In this paper, we apply a seismic data denoising method based on
learning- type overcomplete dictionaries which uses two-dimensional sparse
coding (2DSC). First, we model the input seismic data and dictionaries as
third-order tensors and introduce tensor- linear combinations for data
approximation. Second, we ap- ply learning-type overcomplete dictionary, i.e.,
optimal sparse data representation is achieved through learning and training.
Third, we exploit the alternating minimization algorithm to solve the
optimization problem of seismic denoising. Finally we evaluate its denoising
performance on synthetic seismic data and land data survey. Experiment results
show that the two-dimensional sparse coding scheme reduces computational costs
and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio.

  energy","One more reference([7]) is added",,,,"math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The expansion of the universe has been accepted by scientists for more than a
century. However, since the 1990s, observations have suggested that the
universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. Although the source of this
acceleration is still unknown, cosmologists call it dark energy; a type
mysterious energy which exerts a negative pressure on the universe. In this
paper, applying different approach from those of classical mathematical physics
based mainly on functional analysis, we propose an answer to this question. In
fact, we first establish a theorem for multivalued mappings; and as result we
apply this theorem to show the existence of a remnant field of high energy in a
continuously expanding system of energy. The results may also be applied to the
early universe to show the existence of a possible source for dark energy. The
answer is partially confirmed by a paper published in Nature Asronomy.

assumed to lie on a normal distribution whose width scales like $t^{1/2}$.
However, processes where the probability distribution is not normal and the
scaling exponent differs from $\frac{1}{2}$ are known. The search for possible
origins of such ""anomalous"" scaling and approaches to quantify them are the
motivations for the work reported here. In processes with stationary
increments, where the stochastic process is time-independent, auto-correlations
between increments and infinite variance of increments can cause anomalous
scaling. These sources have been referred to as the $\it{Joseph}$ $\it{effect}$
the $\it{Noah}$ $\it{effect}$, respectively. If the increments are
non-stationary, then scaling of increments with $t$ can also lead to anomalous
scaling, a mechanism we refer to as the $\it{Moses}$ $\it{effect}$. Scaling
exponents quantifying the three effects are defined and related to the Hurst
exponent that characterizes the overall scaling of the stochastic process.
Methods of time series analysis that enable accurate independent measurement of
each exponent are presented. Simple stochastic processes are used to illustrate
each effect. Intraday Financial time series data is analyzed, revealing that
its anomalous scaling is due only to the Moses effect. In the context of
financial market data, we reiterate that the Joseph exponent, not the Hurst
exponent, is the appropriate measure to test the efficient market hypothesis.

Experiment Design (OED) for the determination of properties of porous materials
with in-situ measurements and an identification method. First, an experimental
set-up was presented and used for the measurement of relative humidity within a
wood fibre material submitted to single and multiple steps of relative humidity
variation. Then, the application of OED enabled to plan the experimental
conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20
possible designs. The OED search was performed using the Fisher information
matrix and a priori knowledge of the parameters. It ensures to provide the best
accuracy of the identification method and thus the estimated parameter. Optimal
design results have been found for single steps from the relative humidity phi
= 10 to 75%, with one sensor located at the position X between 4 and 6 cm, for
the estimation of moisture permeability coefficients, while from phi = 75% to
phi = 33%, with one sensor located at X{\deg} = 3 cm, for the estimation of the
advection coefficient. The OED has also been applied for the identification of
couples of parameters. A sample submitted to multiple relative humidity steps
(phi = 10-75-33-75%) with a sensor placed at X{\deg} = 5 cm was found as the
best option for determining both properties with the same experiment. These OED
parameters have then been used for the determination of moisture permeability
and advection coefficients. The estimated moisture permeability coefficients
are twice higher than the a priori values obtained using standard methods. The
advection parameter corresponds to the mass average velocity of the order of v
= 0.01 mm/s within the material and may play an important role on the
simulation of moisture front.
