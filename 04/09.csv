image-to-image translation have made much progress recently. Depending on the
task complexity, thousands to millions of labeled image pairs are needed to
train a conditional GAN. However, human labeling is expensive, even
impractical, and large quantities of data may not always be available. Inspired
by dual learning from natural language translation, we develop a novel dual-GAN
mechanism, which enables image translators to be trained from two sets of
unlabeled images from two domains. In our architecture, the primal GAN learns
to translate images from domain U to those in domain V, while the dual GAN
learns to invert the task. The closed loop made by the primal and dual tasks
allows images from either domain to be translated and then reconstructed. Hence
a loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error of images can be
used to train the translators. Experiments on multiple image translation tasks
with unlabeled data show considerable performance gain of DualGAN over a single
GAN. For some tasks, DualGAN can even achieve comparable or slightly better
results than conditional GAN trained on fully labeled data.

limitations, series may be observed at different sampling rates, representing a
mixed frequency setting. To determine instantaneous and lagged effects between
time series at the true causal scale, we take a model-based approach based on
structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. In this context, we present a
unifying framework for parameter identifiability and estimation under both
subsampling and mixed frequencies when the noise, or shocks, are non-Gaussian.
Importantly, by studying the SVAR case, we are able to both provide
identifiability and estimation methods for the causal structure of both lagged

alternating sum of characters of local Weyl modules. In the language of cluster

in possibly non-convex state-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJ PDEs)
arising from optimal control and differential game problems. The subproblems
are independent and can be implemented in an embarrassingly parallel fashion.
This is an ideal setup for perfect scaling in parallel computing. The algorithm
is proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality [1, 2] when solving HJ PDE.
The major contribution of the paper is to change an optimization problem over a
space of curves to an optimization problem of a single vector, which goes
beyond [23]. We extend [5, 6, 8], and conjecture a (Lax-type) minimization
principle when the Hamiltonian is convex, as well as a (Hopf-type) maximization
principle when the Hamiltonian is non-convex. The conjectured Hopf-type
maximization principle is a generalization of the well-known Hopf formula [11,
16, 30]. We validated formula under restricted assumptions, and bring our
readers to [57] which validates that our conjectures in a more general setting
after a previous version of our paper. We conjectured the weakest assumption is
a psuedoconvexity assumption similar to [46]. The optimization problems are of
the same dimension as that of the HJ PDE. We suggest a coordinate descent
method for the minimization procedure in the generalized Lax/Hopf formula, and
numerical differentiation is used to compute the derivatives. This method is
preferable since the evaluation of the function value itself requires some
computational effort, especially when we handle high dimensional optimization
problem. The use of multiple initial guesses and a certificate of correctness
are suggested to overcome possibly multiple local extrema since the
optimization process is no longer convex. Our method is expected to have
application in control theory and differential game problems, and elsewhere.

the core, with an uncertainty of ~200 000 yr. The core material has probably
been pre-processed for another 500 000 years in conditions corresponding to
those in the ambient molecular cloud. The inferred time scale is more than ten
times the age of the embedded protobinary. The D2H+ and H2D+ ions have large

observed effect become especially pronounced at large tilt angles and
corrugation amplitudes. Magnetotransport properties are further examined in the

bursts continues, despite the ten proposed models. First of all, this is due to
the wide variety of stripes in each new phenomenon, when the explanation of all
the fine details by any one mechanism becomes impossible. The most widespread
explanation is the emission at different levels of double plasma resonance
(DPR), sequential on the height surfaces in the magnetic trap, where the upper
hybrid frequency ($\omega_{UH}$) becomes equal to the integer of electronic
cyclotron harmonics $s\omega_{Be}: \omega_{UH} = (\omega_{Pe}^2 +
\omega_{Be}^2)^{1/2} = s\omega_{Be}$ (Zheleznyakov, Zlotnik, 1975, Winglee,
Dulk, 1986, Kuznetsov & Tsap (2007)). An important alternative mechanism is the
interaction of plasma waves with the whistlers: $l + w \Rightarrow t$ (Chernov,
1976, 2006). Here, we will show the possibility of explaining the main features
of the zebra stripes in the model with whistlers, using the example of the
phenomenon on August 1, 2010.

shown that two one-end-open CNTs with different diameters can coaxially
self-assemble into a nanocapsule. The nanocapsules formed were stable in
aqueous solution under ambient conditions, and the pressure inside the
nanocapsule was much higher than the ambient pressure due to the van der Waals
interactions between two parts of the nanocapsule. The effect of the normalized
radius difference, normalized inter-tube distance and aspect ratio of the CNT
pairs were systematically explored. The electric field response of nanocapsules
was studied with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which shows that
nanocapsules can be opened by applying an external electric field, due to the
polarization of carbon atoms. This discovery not only sheds light on a simple

innovations in drug delivery, nano-reactors, etc.

incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling
the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent
work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the
computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was
tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation
results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex
road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.

the following.
  A weak form of an interesting conjecture of Zhang and Shi (Quantum
Information and Computation, 2009) (The full conjecture has just been reported
to be independently settled by Hatami and Qian (Arxiv, 2017). However, their
techniques are quite different and are not known to yield many of the results

1\}^n \rightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, the weakly unbounded-error complexity of $f \circ
\textsf{XOR}$ is essentially characterized by the number of points $i$ in the
set $\{0,1, \dots,n-2\}$ for which $D_f(i) \neq D_f(i+2)$, where $D_f$ is the
predicate corresponding to $f$. The number of such points is called the
odd-even degree of $f$. We show that the $\textsf{PP}$ complexity of $f \circ

  We resolve a conjecture of a different Zhang characterizing the Threshold of
Parity circuit size of symmetric functions in terms of their odd-even degree.
  We obtain a new proof of the exponential separation between
$\textsf{PP}^{cc}$ and $\textsf{UPP}^{cc}$ via an $\textsf{XOR}$ function.
  We provide a characterization of the approximate spectral norm of symmetric

several consequences.

Exponential integrators are a promising family of time discretizations for
evolutionary partial differential equations. In order to allow the use of these
discretizations in the context of inverse problems adjoints of exponential
integrators are required. This work derives the discrete adjoint formulae for a
W-type exponential propagation iterative methods of Runge-Kutta type (EPIRK-W).
These methods allow arbitrary approximations of the Jacobian while maintaining
the overall accuracy of the forward integration. The use of Jacobian
approximation matrices that do not depend on the model state avoids the complex
calculation of Hessians in the discrete adjoint formulae, and allows efficient
adjoint code generation via algorithmic differentiation. We use the discrete

applied. However, one of the key issues of this scheme is that continuous-time
feedback and memory cannot be incorporated into the channel model. It turns out
that this issue can be circumvented by considering the Brownian motion
formulation of a continuous-time white Gaussian channel. Nevertheless, as
opposed to the white Gaussian noise formulation, a link that establishes the
information-theoretic connection between a continuous-time channel under the
Brownian motion formulation and its discrete-time counterparts has long been
missing. This paper is to fill this gap by establishing causality-preserving
connections between continuous-time Gaussian feedback/memory channels and their
associated discrete-time versions in the forms of sampling and approximation
theorems, which we believe will play important roles in the long run for
further developing continuous-time information theory.
  As an immediate application of the approximation theorem, we propose the
so-called approximation approach to examine continuous-time white Gaussian
channels in the point-to-point or multi-user setting. It turns out that the
approximation approach, complemented by relevant tools from stochastic
calculus, can enhance our understanding of continuous-time Gaussian channels in
terms of giving alternative and strengthened interpretation to some long-held
folklore, recovering ""long known"" results from new perspectives, and rigorously
establishing new results predicted by the intuition that the approximation
approach carries.

The problem is more enigmatic due to the wide range of possible solutions,
ranging from the ultra-light to the super-massive. String theory gives rise to
plausible dark matter candidates due to the breaking of the non--Abelian Grand
Unified Theory (GUT) symmetries by Wilson lines. The physical spectrum then
contains states that do not satisfy the quantisation conditions of the unbroken
GUT symmetry. Given that the Standard Model states are identified with broken
GUT representations, and provided that any ensuing symmetry breaking is induced
by components of GUT states, leaves a remnant discrete symmetry that forbid the
decay of the Wilsonian states. A class of such states are obtained in a
heterotic-string derived $Z^\prime$ model. The model exploits the spinor-vector
duality symmetry, observed in the fermionic $Z_2\times Z_2$ heterotic-string
orbifolds, to generate a $Z^\prime\in E_6$ symmetry that may remain unbroken
down to low energies. The $E_6$ symmetry is broken at the string level with
discrete Wilson lines. The Wilsonian dark matter candidates in the string
derived model are $SO(10)$, and hence Standard Model, singlets and possess
non-$E_6$ $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ charges. Depending on the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$
breaking scale and the reheating temperature they give rise to different
scenarios for the relic abundance, and in accordance with the cosmological
constraints.

relaxes due to the growing phase-space of available electronic states it can

high energy quantum control and manipulation. In one-dimensional systems high
relaxation rates are expected to destabilize electronic quasiparticles. We show
here that the decoherence induced by relaxation of hot electrons in
one-dimensional semiconducting nanowires evolves non-monotonically with energy
such that above a certain threshold hot-electrons regain stability with
increasing energy. We directly observe this phenomenon by visualizing for the
first time the interference patterns of the quasi-one-dimensional electrons
using scanning tunneling microscopy. We visualize both the phase coherence
length of the one-dimensional electrons, as well as their phase coherence time,
captured by crystallographic Fabry-Perot resonators. A remarkable agreement
with a theoretical model reveals that the non-monotonic behavior is driven by
the unique manner in which one dimensional hot-electrons interact with the cold
electrons occupying the Fermi-sea. This newly discovered relaxation profile
suggests a high-energy regime for operating quantum applications that
necessitate extended coherence or long thermalization times, and may stabilize
electronic quasiparticles in one dimension.

for the dust extinction into the account. We show that the vertical lag of the

catastrophic transition. Following these works we present here a numerical
study of a one-dimensional stochastic desertification model, where the
deterministic predictions are confronted with the observed dynamics. Our
results suggest that a stochastic spatial system allows for a propagating front
only when its active phase invades the inactive (desert) one. In the extinction
phase one observes transient front propagation followed by a global collapse.
In the presence of a seed bank the vegetation state is shown to be more robust
against demographic stochasticity, but the transition in that case still
belongs to the directed percolation equivalence class.

employing one scalar field has failed due to the appearance of harmful
singularities near the bounce. In this work, I use four scalar fields to
construct a class of geometric sigma models which are free of singularities.
The models within the class are parametrized by their background geometries. I
prove that, whatever background is chosen, the dynamics of its small
perturbations is classically stable on the whole time axes. Contrary to what
one expects from the structure of the initial Lagrangian, the physics of
background fluctuations is found to carry 2 tensor, 2 vector and 2 scalar
degrees of freedom. The graviton mass, that naturally appears in these models,
is shown to be several orders of magnitude smaller than its experimental bound.
I provide three simple examples to demonstrate how this is done in practice. In
particular, I show that graviton mass can be made arbitrarily small.

diverges, we predict a transition to a regime where states exist below the

repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance we recover the repulsive polaron,
which has a finite lifetime because it can decay into low-lying molecular
states. We show for the entire range of couplings that the polaron energy has

platform for exploring Bose polarons. Recent experimental advances in the field
of ultracold atoms make it possible to realize such systems with highly tunable
microscopic parameters and to explore equilibrium and dynamical properties of
polarons using a rich toolbox of atomic physics. In this paper we present a
detailed theoretical analysis of Bose polarons in one dimensional systems of
ultracold atoms. By combining a non-perturbative renormalization group approach
with numerically exact diffusion Monte Carlo calculations we obtain not only
detailed numerical results over a broad range of parameters but also
qualitative understanding of different regimes of the system. We find that an
accurate description of Bose polarons requires the inclusion of two-phonon
scattering terms which go beyond the commonly used Fr\""ohlich model.
Furthermore we show that when the Bose gas is in the strongly interacting
regime, one needs to include interactions between the phonon modes. We use
several theoretical approaches to calculate the polaron energy and its
effective mass. The former can be measured using radio-frequency spectroscopy
and the latter can be studied experimentally using impurity oscillations in a
harmonic trapping potential. We compare our theoretical results for the
effective mass to the experiments by Catani et al. [PRA 85, 023623 (2012)]. In
the weak-to-intermediate coupling regimes we obtain excellent quantitative
agreement between theory and experiment, without any free fitting parameter. We
supplement our analysis by full dynamical simulations of polaron oscillations
in a shallow trapping potential. We also use our renormalization group approach
to analyze the full phase diagram and identify regions that support repulsive
and attractive polarons, as well as multi-particle bound states.

problems due to its numerous applications in online mechanism design. The task
is to select a maximum weight subset of elements subject to given constraints,
where elements arrive one-by-one in random order, revealing a weight upon
arrival. The decision whether to select an element has to be taken immediately
after its arrival. The different applications that map to the secretary problem
ask for different constraint families to be handled. The most prominent ones
are matroid constraints, which both capture many relevant settings and admit
strongly competitive secretary algorithms. However, dealing with more involved
constraints proved to be much more difficult, and strong algorithms are known
only for a few specific settings. In this paper, we present a general framework
for dealing with the secretary problem over the intersection of several
matroids. This framework allows us to combine and exploit the large set of
matroid secretary algorithms known in the literature. As one consequence, we
get constant-competitive secretary algorithms over the intersection of any
constant number of matroids whose corresponding (single-)matroid secretary
problems are currently known to have a constant-competitive algorithm.

Single-photon transistor (SPT) is an optical transistor in the quantum limit,
which uses a single photon to open or block a photonic channel. In sharp
contrast to all previous SPT proposals which are based on single-photon
nonlinearities, here I present a novel design for a high-gain and high-speed
(up to THz) SPT based on a linear optical effect - giant circular birefringence
(GCB) induced by a single spin in a double-sided optical microcavity. A gate
photon sets the spin state via projective measurement and controls the light
propagation in the optical channel. This spin-cavity transistor can be directly
configured as diodes, routers, DRAM units, switches, modulators, etc. Due to
the duality as quantum gate and transistor, the spin-cavity unit provides a
solid-state platform ideal for future Internet - a mixture of all-optical
Internet with quantum Internet.

maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided
into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user
selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission
probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet
receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully
delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for
accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a
distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between
users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is
computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial
observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel
distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user
reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its
current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used
to maximize the objective function. Game theoretic analysis of the system
dynamics is developed for establishing design principles for the implementation
of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of the
algorithm.

with a surrounding bath can be described in terms of the angulon quasiparticle
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 095301 (2017)]. The angulon consists of a quantum rotor
dressed by a many-particle field of boson excitations, and can be formed out
of, for example, a molecule or a nonspherical atom in superfluid helium, or out
of an electron coupled to lattice phonons or a Bose condensate. Here we develop
an approach to the angulon based on the path-integral formalism, which sets the
ground for a systematic, perturbative treatment of the angulon problem. The
resulting perturbation series can be interpreted in terms of Feynman diagrams,
from which, in turn, one can derive a set of diagrammatic rules. These rules
extend the machinery of the graphical theory of angular momentum - well known
from theoretical atomic spectroscopy - to the case where an environment with an
infinite number of degrees of freedom is present. In particular, we show that
each diagram can be interpreted as a 'skeleton', which enforces angular
momentum conservation, dressed by an additional many-body contribution. This
connection between the angulon theory and the graphical theory of angular
momentum is particularly important as it allows to systematically and
substantially simplify the analytical representation of each diagram. In order
to exemplify the technique, we calculate the 1- and 2-loop contributions to the
angulon self-energy, the spectral function, and the quasiparticle weight. The
diagrammatic theory we develop paves the way to investigate next-to-leading
order quantities in a more compact way compared to the variational approaches.

nonconservation (PNC) has been the isolation of the isovector weak
nucleon-nucleon interaction, expected to be dominated by long-range pion
exchange and enhanced by the neutral current. In meson-exchange descriptions
this interaction together with an isoscalar interaction generated by rho and
omega exchange dominate most observables. Consequently these two amplitudes
have been used to compare and check the consistency of the field's experiments.
Yet to date, despite sensitive searches like that performed with 18F, no
evidence for isovector hadronic PNC has been found. Here we argue, based on
recent large-Nc treatments and new global analyses, that the emphasis on
isovector hadronic PNC was misplaced. Large-Nc provides an alternative and
theoretically better motivated simplification of effective field theories
(EFTs) of hadronic PNC, separating the five low-energy constants (LECs) into
two of leading order (LO), and three others that are NNLO. This scheme pivots
the isospin coordinates we have traditionally used, placing one dominant axis
in the isoscalar plane, and a second along the isotensor direction. We show
that this large-Nc LEC hierarchy accurately describes all existing data on
hadronic PNC, and we discuss opportunities to further test the predicted
large-Nc hierarchy of LECs, illustrating the kind of analyses experimentalists
can use to better constrain the LO theory and to determine the size of NNLO
corrections.

a component that can be implemented feasibly is limited. Therefore, distributed
quantum computation is required to scale up quantum computers.
  This dissertation presents a new quantum computer architecture which takes
into account imperfections, aimed to realize distributed computation by
connecting quantum computers each of which consists of multiple quantum CPUs
and memories. Quantum CPUs employ a quantum error correcting code which has
faster logical gates and quantum memories employ a code which is superior in
space resource requirements.
  This dissertation focuses on quantum error correcting codes, giving a
practical, concrete method for tolerating static losses such as faulty devices
for the surface code. Numerical simulation with practical assumptions showed
that a yield of functional qubits of 90% is marginally capable of building
large-scale systems, by culling the poorer 50% of lattices during
post-fabrication testing. Yield 80% is not usable even when culling 90% of
generated lattices.
  For internal connections in a quantum computer and for connections between
quantum computers, this dissertation gives a fault-tolerant method that bridges
heterogeneous quantum error correcting codes. Numerical simulation showed that
the scheme, which discards any quantum state in which any error is detected,
always achieves an adequate logical error rate regardless of physical error
rates in exchange for increased resource consumption.
  This dissertation gives a new extension of the surface code suitable for
memories. This code is shown to require fewer physical qubits to encode a
logical qubit than conventional codes. This code achieves the reduction of 50%
physical qubits per a logical qubit.
  Collectively, the elements to propose the distributed quantum computer

modify and combine existing methods for finding undirected graphs with methods
for finding directed graphs. These hybrid methods are not only faster, but also
perform better than the directed graph estimation methods alone for a variety

developed. $p$-Adic degeneracy of the genetic code is pointed out. Ultrametric
tree of the codon space is presented. It is shown that codons and amino acids
can be treated as $p$-adic ultrametric networks. Ultrametric modification of
the Hamming distance is defined and noted how it can be useful. Ultrametric
approach with $p$-adic distance is an attractive and promising trend towards
investigation of bioinformation.
