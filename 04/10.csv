  Posterior Probabilities","Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2017",,,,"cs.SD cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voice conversion (VC) using sequence-to-sequence learning of context
posterior probabilities is proposed. Conventional VC using shared context
posterior probabilities predicts target speech parameters from the context
posterior probabilities estimated from the source speech parameters. Although
conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert
speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in
the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are
directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume
that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose
sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior
probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length
transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further,
we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to
conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates
posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech
parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the
proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the conventional VC.

the optimal power control policy which maximizes the EE of the secondary users

Here, we present an abstract epithelium model at the pluricellular level, which
intends to make the self-organization of ciliary beating patterns as well as of
the associated fluid transport across the airway epithelium plausible. Ciliated
cells are modeled in terms of locally interacting oscillating two-state
actuators. The local interactions among these boolean actuators are triggered
by seeded mucus lumps. In the course of a simulation the actuators' state and
the associated mucus velocity field self-organize in tandem. We suggest to
consider the dynamics on multiciliated epithelia in the context of adaptive
(boolean) networks. Within the framework of adaptive boolean networks ciliated
cells represent the nodes and as the mucus establishes the local interactions
among nodes, its distribution determines the topology of the network.
Furthermore, we present the results and insights from comprehensive parameter
studies. The results show evidence that so called deterministic update schemes,
which are meant to represent intercellular signaling, lead to more realistic
and robust dynamics and may therefore be favored by nature. Finally, we suppose
that unciliated cells introduce a modular network topology on ciliated
epithelia causing the self-organization taking place simultaneously in each
""ciliated module"". This reasoning provides the first consistent explanation for
the meaning of the observed patchy expression patterns of the mucus modulation
wave fields. Modularity may therefore be seen as a modular construction plan of
nature for ciliated epithelia whose number of cells range over several order of
magnitudes.

frozen-in-time fields. To do this we analize the ensamble particle acceleration
for static electromagnetic fields extracted from direct numerical simulations
of the MHD equations, and compare with the dynamical fields. We show that a
reduction in particle acceleration in the dynamical model results from the
particle trapping in the field lines, which forces the particles to remain in a
moving current sheet that suppress the longer exposure at the strong electric
field gradients located between structures, which is an efficient particle
acceleration mechanism. In addition, we analize the effect of anisotropy caused
by the mean magnetic field. It is well known that for sufficiently strong
external fields, the system suffers a transition towards a two-dimensional
flow. This causes an increment in the size of the coherent structures,
resulting in a magnetized state of the particles and the reduction of the
particle energization.

squared matrix elements can be generated automatically. As an application we
compute the decay of the light, CP-even Higgs boson of the Two-Higgs-Doublet
Model into four fermions at next-to-leading order. The comparison of different
schemes and the investigation of the renormalization scale dependence allows us
to test the perturbative consistency in each of the renormalization schemes,

a tracer of sources of energetic photons -- primarily hot stars and accreting

with a realizable instrument placed in a low altitude lunar orbit, performing
night-time 40-120 MHz spectral observations, while on the farside to avoid
terrestrial radio frequency interference, ionospheric corruption, and solar

unpolarized state of the redshifted 21-cm spectrum are distinct from the
spectrally featureless, spatially-varying, and polarized emission from the
bright foregrounds. This allows a clean separation between the primordial
signal and foregrounds. For signal extraction, we model the foreground,
instrument, and 21-cm spectrum with eigenmodes calculated via Singular Value
Decomposition analyses. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to explore
the parameter space defined by the coefficients associated with these modes, we
illustrate how the spectrum can be measured and how astrophysical parameters

prove a version of Gromov's non-existence of exact Lagrangian embeddings into
standard $\mathbb{R}^{2 n}$ for coisotropic embeddings into $S^1 \times

the air-water free surface on the stratified shear instabilities of the fluid

equation for smooth velocity and density profiles of a model shear layer with a
free surface. When the depth of the fluid is relatively shallow compared to the
shear layer thickness, the surface gravity waves existing at the free surface
come closer to the waves existing in the shear layer. This can lead to resonant
wave interactions, making the flow unstable to more varieties of modal
instabilities. To obtain a deeper understanding of the instability mechanisms,
we have performed analytical studies with broken-line profiles. Furthermore,
reduced order broken-line profiles have also been developed, based on which
dispersion diagrams are constructed. Through these diagrams we have underpinned
the resonantly interacting waves leading to each type of instability. Two new
instabilities have been found; one of them, referred to as the surface gravity
- interfacial gravity (SG-IG) mode, arises due to the interaction between a
surface gravity wave and an interfacial gravity wave, and would be absent if
there is no internal density stratification. The other one - the surface
gravity - lower vorticity (SG-LV) mode, which arises due to the interaction
between a surface gravity wave and the lower vorticity wave, surpasses
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to become the most unstable mode. Except for
Holmboe instability, remarkable differences are observed in all other
instabilities occurring in shallow domains when the air-water interface is
replaced by a rigid lid. We infer that the rigid-lid approximation is valid for
large vertical domains. We have also shown that if shear is absent at the free
surface, our problem can be modeled using a Boussinesq type approximation.

move one of the checkpoints from its old time to the current time, and his goal

  Bringmann et al. studied this problem as a special case of an online/offline
optimization problem in which the deviation from uniformity is measured by the
natural discrepancy metric of the worst case ratio between real and ideal
segment lengths. They showed this discrepancy is smaller than $1.59-o(1)$ for
all $k$, and smaller than $\ln4-o(1)\approx1.39$ for the sparse subset of $k$'s

discrepancy for all large $k$, and by providing tight upper and lower bounds

  fluids",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Viscous flows in a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw geometry can lead to an
interfacial instability when one fluid, of viscosity $\eta_{in}$ displaces
another of higher viscosity, $\eta_{out}$. Recent studies have shown that there
is a delay in the onset of fingering in miscible fluids as the viscosity ratio,
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out}$, increases and approaches unity; the interface can
remain stable even though the displacing liquid is less viscous. This paper
shows that a delayed onset and stable pattern can occur in immiscible fluids as
well. However, there are two significant differences between the two cases.
First, in miscible fluids, stable patterns are obtained whenever
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out} > 0.33$ while in immiscible fluids, the radius at which
the onset of fingering starts, $R_{onset}$, increases steadily until
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out}=1$. A stable pattern is obtained only when the total size
of the plate used is smaller than $R_{onset}$. Second, once the delayed
fingering starts in immiscible fluids, the fingers grow faster than the central
circular region. In miscible fluids, there is a regime in which the fingers and
the central region grow in proportion to each other. These differences between
miscible and immiscible fingering are maintained even when we compare
immiscible fluids that have very low interfacial tension with miscible fluids
that have negligible diffusion.

promising use of in-package DRAM is as a large cache. Unfortunately, most
previous DRAM cache designs mainly optimize for hit latency and do not consider
off-chip bandwidth efficiency as a first-class design constraint. Hence, as we
show in this paper, these designs are suboptimal for use with in-package DRAM.
  We propose a new DRAM cache design, Banshee, that optimizes for both in- and
off-package DRAM bandwidth efficiency without degrading access latency. The key
ideas are to eliminate the in-package DRAM bandwidth overheads due to costly
tag accesses through virtual memory mechanism and to incorporate a
bandwidth-aware frequency-based replacement policy that is biased to reduce
unnecessary traffic to off-package DRAM. Our extensive evaluation shows that
Banshee provides significant performance improvement and traffic reduction over

crucial to design an efficient group key agreement protocol. Moreover, with the
emergence of various group-based services, it is becoming common for several
multicast groups to coexist in the same network. These multicast groups may
have several shared users; a join or leave request by a single user can trigger
regeneration of multiple group keys. Under the given circumstances the rekeying
process becomes a challenging task. In this work, we propose a novel
methodology for group key agreement which exploits the state vectors of group
members. The state vector is a set of randomly generated nonce instances which
determine the logical link between group members and which empowers the group
member to generate multiple cryptographic keys independently. Using local
knowledge of a secret nonce, each member can generate and share a large number
of secure keys, indicating that SGRS inherently provides a considerable amount
of secure subgroup multicast communication using subgroup multicasting keys

orbitals. The general and rigorous theory of orbital susceptibility developed
in the preceding paper is applied to a model for graphene as a typical two-band
model. It is found that there are contributions from interband, Fermi surface,
and occupied states in addition to the Landau--Peierls orbital susceptibility.
The relative phase between the atomic orbitals on the two sublattices related
to the chirality of Dirac cones plays an important role. It is shown that there
are some additional contributions to the orbital susceptibility that are not
included in the previous calculations using the Peierls phase in the
tight-binding model for graphene. The physical origin of this difference is
clarified in terms of the corrections to the Peierls phase.

higher-dimensional operator with right-handed neutrinos may provide an
additional production which is most effective at the reheating epoch. It is

a number of unique challenges including extremely small object sizes, both
sparse and densely-packed objects, and extremely large search spaces (large
video frames). Nearly all state-of-the-art methods in WAMI object detection
report that appearance-based classifiers fail in this challenging data and
instead rely almost entirely on motion information in the form of background
subtraction or frame-differencing. In this work, we experimentally verify the
failure of appearance-based classifiers in WAMI, such as Faster R-CNN and a
heatmap-based fully convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a novel
two-stage spatio-temporal CNN which effectively and efficiently combines both
appearance and motion information to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art

(ClusterNet) takes in a set of extremely large video frames, combines the
motion and appearance information within the convolutional architecture, and
proposes regions of objects of interest (ROOBI). These ROOBI can contain from
one to clusters of several hundred objects due to the large video frame size
and varying object density in WAMI. The second stage (FoveaNet) then estimates
the centroid location of all objects in that given ROOBI simultaneously via
heatmap estimation. The proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art results on the

resulting time complexity has a low dependency on the parameter. However, the
time complexity often becomes a large polynomial in the input size because we
need to compute half-integral optimal LP solutions.
  In this paper, we address this issue by providing an $O(km)$-time algorithm
for solving the LPs arising from various FPT problems, where $k$ is the optimal
value and $m$ is the number of edges/constraints. Our algorithm is based on
interesting connections among 0/1/all constraints, which has been studied in
the field of constraints satisfaction, $A$-path packing, which has been studied

Multiway Cut, Node Unique Label Cover, and Non-monochromatic Cycle Transversal.
The obtained running time for each of these problems is linear in the input

the creation of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and decision support systems

features and a priori knowledge of the user. As such, these methods are
difficult to adopt within a clinical environment. Recently, deep learning
methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have been successful in
many segmentation problems primarily because they leverage a large labelled
dataset to hierarchically learn the features that best correspond to the
shallow visual appearance as well as the deep semantics of the areas to be
segmented. However, FCNs based on a 16 layer VGGNet architecture have limited
capacity to add additional layers. Therefore, it is challenging to learn more
discriminative features among different classes for FCNs. In this study, we
overcome these limitations using deep residual networks (ResNet) to segment
liver lesions. ResNet contain skip connections between convolutional layers,
which solved the problem of the training degradation of training accuracy in
very deep networks and thereby enables the use of additional layers for
learning more discriminative features. In addition, we achieve more precise
boundary definitions through a novel cascaded ResNet architecture with
multi-scale fusion to gradually learn and infer the boundaries of both the

polarization plane of the CMB with arcsecond accuracy, enabling unprecedented
measurements for cosmology and fundamental physics. Existing and planned CMB
polarization instruments looking for primordial B-mode signals need an
independent, experimental method for systematics control on the absolute
polarization orientation. The lack of such a method limits the accuracy of the
detection of inflationary gravitational waves, the constraining power on the
neutrino sector through measurements of gravitational lensing of the CMB, the
possibility of detecting Cosmic Birefringence, and the ability to measure
primordial magnetic fields. Sky signals used for calibration and direct
measurements of the detector orientation cannot provide an accuracy better than
1 deg. Self-calibration methods provide better accuracy, but may be affected by
foreground signals and rely heavily on model assumptions. The POLarization
Orientation CALibrator for Cosmology, POLOCALC, will dramatically improve
instrumental accuracy by means of an artificial calibration source flying on
balloons and aerial drones. A balloon-borne calibrator will provide far-field
source for larger telescopes, while a drone will be used for tests and smaller
polarimeters. POLOCALC will also allow a unique method to measure the
telescopes' polarized beam. It will use microwave emitters between 40 and 150
GHz coupled to precise polarizing filters. The orientation of the source
polarization plane will be registered to sky coordinates by star cameras and
gyroscopes with arcsecond accuracy. This project can become a rung in the
calibration ladder for the field: any existing or future CMB polarization
experiment observing our polarization calibrator will enable measurements of
the polarization angle for each detector with respect to absolute sky
coordinates.

in a peculiar manner even in the paramagnetic state harboring the quantum spin
liquid state. We here present a comprehensive theoretical study of the spin
dynamics in a wide $T$ range for the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice, whose
ground state is such a quantum spin liquid. In this model, the
fractionalization occurs to break up quantum spins into itinerant matter
fermions and localized gauge fluxes, which results in two crossovers at very
different $T$ scales. Extending the previous study for the isotropic coupling
case [J. Yoshitake, J. Nasu, and Y. Motome, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\textbf 117}$,
157203 (2016)], we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor, the NMR
relaxation rate, and the magnetic susceptibility while changing the anisotropy
in the exchange coupling constants, by using the dynamical mean-field theory
and the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method based on a Majorana fermion
representation. We find that the system exhibits peculiar behaviors below the
high-$T$ crossover whose temperature is comparable to the average of the
exchange constants, reflecting the spin fractionalization in the paramagnetic
region. Among them, the dichotomy between the static and dynamical spin
correlations is unusual behavior hardly seen in conventional magnets. We
discuss the relation between the dichotomy and the spatial configuration of
gauge fluxes. Our results could stimulate further experimental and theoretical

the class of finite multivariate Markov chains. Agents are seen as entities
that act, perceive, and are goal-directed.
  We present a new measure that can be used to identify entities (called
$\iota$-entities), some general requirements for entities in multivariate
Markov chains, as well as formal definitions of actions and perceptions
suitable for such entities.
  The intuition behind $\iota$-entities is that entities are spatiotemporal
patterns for which every part makes every other part more probable. The
measure, complete local integration (CLI), is formally investigated in general
Bayesian networks. It is based on the specific local integration (SLI) which is
measured with respect to a partition. CLI is the minimum value of SLI over all
partitions. We prove that $\iota$-entities are blocks in specific partitions of
the global trajectory. These partitions are the finest partitions that achieve
a given SLI value. We also establish the transformation behaviour of SLI under
permutations of nodes in the network.
  We go on to present three conditions on general definitions of entities.
These are not fulfilled by sets of random variables i.e.\ the perception-action
loop, which is often used to model agents, is too restrictive. We propose that
any general entity definition should in effect specify a subset (called an an
entity-set) of the set of all spatiotemporal patterns of a given multivariate
Markov chain. The set of $\iota$-entities is such a set. Importantly the
perception-action loop also induces an entity-set.
  We then propose formal definitions of actions and perceptions for arbitrary
entity-sets. These specialise to standard notions in case of the
perception-action loop entity-set.
  Finally we look at some very simple examples.

helical forcing and the system rotation, the mean flow directed to the rotation
axis is generated and sustained. We investigate the physical origin of this
flow-generation phenomenon by considering the budget of the Reynolds-stress
transport equation. It is found that the pressure diffusion term has a large
contribution in the Reynolds stress equation and supports the generated mean
flow. It is shown that a model expression for the pressure diffusion can be
expressed by the turbulent helicity gradient coupled with the angular velocity
of the system rotation. This implies that inhomogeneous helicity can play a
significant role for the generation of the large-scale velocity distribution in

mechanism(s) guiding the stellar-mass buildup of this special class of
galaxies, the most massive in the Universe uniquely residing at the centres of
galaxy clusters. Through a comparison of their stacked, broadband, infrared
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a variety of SED model templates in the
literature, we identify the major sources of their infrared energy output, in
multiple redshift bins between 0 < z < 1.8. We derive estimates of various BCG
physical parameters from the stacked {\nu}L{\nu} SEDs, from which we infer a
star-forming, as opposed to a 'red and dead' population of galaxies, producing
tens to hundreds of solar masses per year down to z=0.5. This discovery
challenges the accepted belief that BCGs should only passively evolve through a
series of gas-poor, minor mergers since z~4 (De Lucia & Blaizot 2007), but
agrees with the improved semi-analytic model of hierarchical structure
formation of Tonini et al. (2012), which predicts star-forming BCGs throughout
the epoch considered. We attribute the star formation inferred from the stacked
infrared SEDs to both major and minor 'wet' (gas-rich) mergers, based on a lack
of key signatures (to date) of the cluster cooling flows to which BCG star
formation is typically attributed, as well as a number of observational and

to 3D spaces. Tilt Brush and Oculus Quill are widely accepted among artists as
tools that pave the way to a new form of art - 3D emmersive painting. Current
3D painting systems are only a start, emitting textured triangular geometries.
In this paper, we advance this new art of 3D painting to 3D volumetric painting
that enables an artist to draw a huge scene with full control of spatial color
fields. Inspired by the fact that 2D paintings often use vast space to paint
background and small but detailed space for foreground, we claim that
supporting a large canvas in varying detail is essential for 3D painting. In
order to help artists focus and audiences to navigate the large canvas space,
we provide small artist-defined areas, called rooms, that serve as beacons for
artist-suggested scales, spaces, locations for intended appreciation view of
the painting. Artists and audiences can easily transport themselves between
different rooms. Technically, our canvas is represented as an array of deep
octrees of depth 24 or higher, built on CPU for volume painting and on GPU for
volume rendering using accurate ray casting. In CPU side, we design an
efficient iterative algorithm to refine or coarsen octree, as a result of
volumetric painting strokes, at highly interactive rates, and update the
corresponding GPU textures. Then we use GPU-based ray casting algorithms to
render the volumetric painting result. We explore precision issues stemming
from ray-casting the octree of high depth, and provide a new analysis and
verification. From our experimental results as well as the positive feedback
from the participating artists, we strongly believe that our new 3D volume
painting system can open up a new possibility for VR-driven digital art medium
to professional artists as well as to novice users.

degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the considered channel is $\frac{\beta -1}{\beta}K$

that even without instantaneous CSIT, \textit{interference-free DoF per cell}
is achievable as $\beta$ approaches infinity with a sufficiently large number
of users per cell. This achievability is shown by a blind interference
management method that exploits the relativity in delay spreads between desired

aligned to the same direction by using a discrete-Fourier-transform-based
precoding with cyclic prefix that only depends on the number of CIR taps. Using
this method, we also characterize the achievable sum rate of the considered

viscous polymer fluids, based on the observation of the evolution under simple
shear flow of a photobleached pattern within a fluorescent labeled polymer
melt. This straightforward method provides access to slip length at top and
bottom interfaces in the 1 $\mu$m to 1 mm range and to the actual shear rate
experienced by the fluid. Based on simple optical imaging and image analysis
techniques, this method affords an improvement compared to previously reported
methods in which the photobleached fluorescence intensity profiles before and
after shear were compared and measured by scanning a photomultiplier. The
present method relies on a direct determination of the displacement profile
inside the polymer fluid from an analysis of the 3D evolution of the whole
photobleached pattern. We demonstrate the potential of this method with
measurements of the slip length for an entangled PDMS melt, as a function of
the shear rate, in contact with several weakly surfaces i.e. end-tethered PDMS
or polystyrene (PS) chains, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of
trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane (OTS), and a glassy PS thin-film.

candidates including 63 known and 139 other potential lens candidates. A second
search of 1.4 million early type galaxies selected from the survey catalog as
potential deflectors, identified 2,465 candidates including 117 previously
known lens candidates, 29 confirmed lenses/high-quality lens candidates, 266
novel probable or potential lenses and 2097 candidates we classify as false

commonly used linear PBE solvers for the ever-improving graphics processing

cuSPARSE, cuBLAS, and CUSP. Extensive tests show that good numerical accuracy
can be achieved given that the single precision is often used for numerical
applications on GPU platforms. The optimal GPU performance was observed with
the Jacobi-preconditioned CG solver, with a significant speedup over standard
CG solver on CPU in our diversified test cases. Our analysis further shows that
different matrix storage formats also considerably affect the efficiency of
different linear PBE solvers on GPU, with the diagonal format best suited for
our standard finite-difference linear systems. Further efficiency may be
possible with matrix-free operations and integrated grid stencil setup
specifically tailored for the banded matrices in PBE-specific linear systems.

advisable to design systems with robustness as the main criteria, possibly at
the price of reduced peak performance and efficiency. Ensuring robust
communications in case of embedded or hidden antennas is a challenging task due
to nonisotropic radiation patterns of these antennas. The challenges due to the
nonisotropic radiation patterns can be overcome with the use of multiple
antennas. In this paper, we describe a simple, low-cost method for combining
the output of multiple nonisotropic antennas to guarantee robustness, i.e.,
support reliable communications in worst-case scenarios. The combining method
is designed to minimize the burst error probability, i.e., the probability of
consecutive decoding errors of status messages arriving periodically at a
receiver from an arbitrary angle of arrival. The proposed method does not
require the knowledge of instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios or the
complex-valued channel gains at the antenna outputs. The proposed method is
applied to measured and theoretical antenna radiation patterns, and it is shown
that the method supports robust communications from an arbitrary angle of

infinite number of external potentials is a tau function of the KP hierarchy
with respect to the coupling constants $\mathbf{t} = (t_1,t_2,\ldots)$. A
single-variate specialization $Z(x)$ of $Z(\mathbf{t})$ satisfies a
$q$-difference equation representing the quantum spectral curve of the melting
crystal model. In the limit as the radius $R$ of $S^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^4\times
S^1$ tends to $0$, it turns into a difference equation for a 4D counterpart
$Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(X)$ of $Z(x)$. This difference equation reproduces the quantum
spectral curve of Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{CP}^1$. $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(X)$
is obtained from $Z(x)$ by letting $R \to 0$ under an $R$-dependent
transformation $x = x(X,R)$ of $x$ to $X$. A similar prescription of 4D limit
can be formulated for $Z(\mathbf{t})$ with an $R$-dependent transformation
$\mathbf{t} = \mathbf{t}(\mathbf{T},R)$ of $\mathbf{t}$ to $\mathbf{T} =
(T_1,T_2,\ldots)$. This yields a 4D counterpart $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$
of $Z(\mathbf{t})$. $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$ agrees with a generating
function of all-genus Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{CP}^1$. Fay-type
bilinear equations for $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$ can be derived from
similar equations satisfied by $Z(\mathbf{t})$. The bilinear equations imply
that $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$, too, is a tau function of the KP hierarchy.
These results are further extended to deformations $Z(\mathbf{t},s)$ and
$Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T},s)$ by a discrete variable $s \in \mathbb{Z}$,
which are shown to be tau functions of the 1D Toda hierarchy.

those that were recently discovered in two other GGCs, NGC 2419 and 2808. The
abundances of K, Na, and Mg were determined using high-resolution 2df spectra
obtained with the AAT. The 1D NLTE abundance estimates were obtained using 1D

$\Delta_{\rm 3D-1D~LTE}$, for the spectral lines of Na, Mg, and K used in our
study. These abundance corrections were used to understand the role of
convection in the formation of spectral lines, as well as to estimate the
differences in the abundances obtained with the 3D hydrodynamical and 1D

their RMS variations due to star-to-star abundance spreads determined in our

mileage or time reaches predefined threshold. The date of delivering an
Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train to maintenance ranges within a time window
rather than be a fixed date. Obviously, changing the delivering date always
means a different impact on the supply of EMU trains and operation cost.
Therefore, the delivering plan has the potential to be optimized. This paper
formulates the EMU train high-level maintenance planning problem as a
non-linear 0-1 programming model. The model aims at minimizing the mileage loss
of all EMU trains with the consideration of the maintenance capacity of the
workshop and maintenance ratio at different times. The number of trains under
maintenance not only depends on the current maintenance plan, but also
influenced by the trains whose maintenance time span from the last planning
horizon to current horizon. A state function is established to describe whether
a train is under maintenance. By using this function the constraint of
restricting the total number of trains that are under maintenance can be
formulated reasonably well. Finally, a simulated annealing algorithm is
proposed for solving the problem.

scalar field case. We show that propagation speeds of gravitational wave and
scalar field wave in these theories may differ from the light speed depending
on background field configuration, and find that a Killing horizon becomes a
boundary of causal domain if the scalar fields share the symmetry of the
background spacetime. About the shock formation, we focus on transport of
discontinuity in second derivatives of the metric and scalar field in the
shift-symmetric Horndeski theory. We find that amplitude of the discontinuity
generically diverges within finite time, which corresponds to shock formation.
It turns out that the canonical scalar field and the scalar DBI model, among
other theories described by the Horndeski theory, are free from such shock
formation even when the background geometry and scalar field configuration are
nontrivial. We also observe that gravitational wave is protected against shock
formation when the background has some symmetries at least. This fact may
indicate that the gravitational wave in this theory is more well-behaved
compared to the scalar field, which typically suffers from shock formation.

The presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, as well as
substantial shear viscosity, allows [EMIM][BF4] simultaneously to facilitate
separation of phosphorene sheets and to protect them from getting in direct
contact with moisture and oxygen. The exfoliation thermodynamics is moderately
unfavorable, indicating that an external stimulus is necessary. Unexpectedly,
[EMIM][BF4] does not coordinates phosphorene by p-electron stacking with the

characterized by the statistics of the fracture geometry and hydraulic
conductivity. While it is well known that tracer transport through fractured
media can be anomalous and particle injection modes can have major impact on
dispersion, the incorporation of injection modes into effective transport
modelling has remained an open issue. The fundamental reason behind this
challenge is that---even if the Eulerian fluid velocity is steady---the
Lagrangian velocity distribution experienced by tracer particles evolves with
time from its initial distribution, which is dictated by the injection mode, to
a stationary velocity distribution. We quantify this evolution by a Markov
model for particle velocities that are equidistantly sampled along
trajectories. This stochastic approach allows for the systematic incorporation
of the initial velocity distribution and quantifies the interplay between
velocity distribution and spatial and temporal correlation. The proposed
spatial Markov model is characterized by the initial velocity distribution,
which is determined by the particle injection mode, the stationary Lagrangian
velocity distribution, which is derived from the Eulerian velocity
distribution, and the spatial velocity correlation length, which is related to
the characteristic fracture length. This effective model leads to a time-domain
random walk for the evolution of particle positions and velocities, whose joint
distribution follows a Boltzmann equation. Finally, we demonstrate that the
proposed model can successfully predict anomalous transport through discrete
fracture networks with different levels of heterogeneity and arbitrary tracer
injection modes.

astronomers. It plays a crucial role in the thermodynamics of interstellar
clouds, because of the gas-dust collisional coupling. It is also a key
parameter in astrochemical studies that governs the rate at which molecules
form on dust. In 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations often a simple expression
for the dust temperature is adopted, because of computational constraints,
while astrochemical modelers tend to keep the dust temperature constant over a
large range of parameter space. Our aim is to provide an easy-to-use parametric
expression for the dust temperature as a function of visual extinction ($A_{\rm
V}$) and to shed light on the critical dependencies of the dust temperature on
the grain composition. We obtain an expression for the dust temperature by
semi-analytically solving the dust thermal balance for different types of
grains and compare to a collection of recent observational measurements. We
also explore the effect of ices on the dust temperature. Our results show that
a mixed carbonaceous-silicate type dust with a high carbon volume fraction
matches the observations best. We find that ice formation allows the dust to be
warmer by up to 15% at high optical depths ($A_{\rm V}> 20$ mag) in the
interstellar medium. Our parametric expression for the dust temperature is
presented as $T_{\rm d} = \left[ 11 + 5.7\times \tanh\bigl( 0.61 -

one of the long-standing open questions of \emph{distributed graph algorithms}
from the late 1980s, which asked for a polylogarithmic-time algorithm. See,
e.g., Open Problem 4 in the Distributed Graph Coloring book of Barenboim and
Elkin. The previous best round complexities were $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$ by
Panconesi and Srinivasan [STOC'92] and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\Delta}) + O(\log^* n)$
by Fraigniaud, Heinrich, and Kosowski [FOCS'16]. A corollary of our
deterministic list-edge-coloring also improves the randomized complexity of
$(2\Delta-1)$-edge-coloring to poly$(\log\log n)$ rounds.
  The key technical ingredient is a deterministic distributed algorithm for
\emph{hypergraph maximal matching}, which we believe will be of interest beyond
this result. In any hypergraph of rank $r$ --- where each hyperedge has at most
$r$ vertices --- with $n$ nodes and maximum degree $\Delta$, this algorithm
computes a maximal matching in $O(r^5 \log^{6+\log r } \Delta \log n)$ rounds.
  This hypergraph matching algorithm and its extensions lead to a number of
other results. In particular, a polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed
maximal independent set algorithm for graphs with bounded neighborhood
independence, hence answering Open Problem 5 of Barenboim and Elkin's book, a
$((\log \Delta/\varepsilon)^{O(\log (1/\varepsilon))})$-round deterministic
algorithm for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of maximum matching, and a
quasi-polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed algorithm for orienting
$\lambda$-arboricity graphs with out-degree at most $(1+\varepsilon)\lambda$,
for any constant $\varepsilon>0$, hence partially answering Open Problem 10 of
Barenboim and Elkin's book.

Carlo techniques have become very popular in signal processing over the last
years. Importance Sampling (IS) is a well-known Monte Carlo technique that
approximates integrals involving a posterior distribution by means of weighted
samples. In this work, we study the assignation of a single weighted sample
which compresses the information contained in a population of weighted samples.
Part of the theory that we present as Group Importance Sampling (GIS) has been
employed implicitly in different works in the literature. The provided analysis
yields several theoretical and practical consequences. For instance, we discuss
the application of GIS into the Sequential Importance Resampling framework and
show that Independent Multiple Try Metropolis schemes can be interpreted as a
standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, following the GIS approach. We also
introduce two novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques based on GIS.
The first one, named Group Metropolis Sampling method, produces a Markov chain
of sets of weighted samples. All these sets are then employed for obtaining a
unique global estimator. The second one is the Distributed Particle
Metropolis-Hastings technique, where different parallel particle filters are
jointly used to drive an MCMC algorithm. Different resampled trajectories are
compared and then tested with a proper acceptance probability. The novel
schemes are tested in different numerical experiments such as learning the
hyperparameters of Gaussian Processes, two localization problems in a wireless
sensor network (with synthetic and real data) and the tracking of vegetation
parameters given satellite observations, where they are compared with several
benchmark Monte Carlo techniques. Three illustrative Matlab demos are also
provided.

Gaussian vector autoregressive model with coefficients evolving over time. The
estimation procedure is achieved through variational Bayesian approximation and
is extended for multiple trials. This Bayesian State Space (BSS) model provides
a dynamical Granger-causality statistic that is quite natural. We propose to
extend the BSS model to include the \`{a} trous Haar decomposition. This
wavelet-based forecasting method is based on a multiscale resolution
decomposition of the signal using the redundant \`{a} trous wavelet transform
and allows us to capture short- and long-range dependencies between signals.
Equally importantly it allows us to derive the desired dynamical and
frequency-specific Granger-causality statistic. The application of these models

issue not yet addressed due to the difficulties in dealing with the
non-Markovian nature of synaptic transmission. Here, we develop a mean-field
dimensional reduction yielding to an effective Markovian dynamics of the
population density of the neuronal membrane potential, valid under the
hypothesis of small fluctuations of the synaptic current. The resulting theory
allows us to prove the formal equivalence between local and distributed
inertia, holding for any synaptic time scale, integrate-and-fire neuron model,
spike emission regimes and for different network states even when the neuron
number is finite.

assign arbitrary charges to the system. The explicit hydrogen bond changes the
coordination number of the acceptor site and the approach is thus most suitable
for systems with under-coordinated atoms, such as many metal-organic

complexity reduction scenarios where inconsequential hidden nodes can be pruned

online active learning mechanism which expedites the training process and
relieves operator labelling efforts. In addition, pRVFLN introduces a
non-parametric type of hidden node, developed using an interval-valued data

not constrained by a specific shape of the cluster. All learning procedures of

the Bayesian paradigm is complicated by the intractability of the observed data
likelihood. There has therefore been considerable attention given to the design
of pseudo-marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for such models.
However, these methods are typically computationally intensive, often require
careful tuning and must be restarted from scratch upon receipt of new
observations. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods on the other hand aim to
efficiently reuse posterior samples at each time point. Despite their appeal,
applying SMC schemes in scenarios with both dynamic states and static
parameters is made difficult by the problem of particle degeneracy. A
principled approach for overcoming this problem is to move each parameter
particle through a Metropolis-Hastings kernel that leaves the target invariant.
This rejuvenation step is key to a recently proposed SMC$^2$ algorithm, which
can be seen as the pseudo-marginal analogue of an idealised scheme known as
iterated batch importance sampling. Computing the parameter weights in SMC$^2$
requires running a particle filter over dynamic states to unbiasedly estimate
the intractable observed data likelihood contributions at each time point. In
this paper, we propose to use an auxiliary particle filter inside the SMC$^2$
scheme. Our method uses two recently proposed constructs for sampling
conditioned jump processes and we find that the resulting inference schemes
typically require fewer state particles than when using a simple bootstrap
filter. Using two applications, we compare the performance of the proposed

intra-class variance and small inter-class variance, aiming at recognizing
hundreds of sub-categories belonging to the same basic-level category. Most
existing fine-grained image classification methods generally learn part
detection models to obtain the semantic parts for better classification
accuracy. Despite achieving promising results, these methods mainly have two
limitations: (1) not all the parts which obtained through the part detection
models are beneficial and indispensable for classification, and (2)
fine-grained image classification requires more detailed visual descriptions
which could not be provided by the part locations or attribute annotations. For
addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes the two-stream model
combining vision and language (CVL) for learning latent semantic
representations. The vision stream learns deep representations from the
original visual information via deep convolutional neural network. The language
stream utilizes the natural language descriptions which could point out the
discriminative parts or characteristics for each image, and provides a flexible
and compact way of encoding the salient visual aspects for distinguishing
sub-categories. Since the two streams are complementary, combining the two
streams can further achieves better classification accuracy. Comparing with 12
state-of-the-art methods on the widely used CUB-200-2011 dataset for

many researchers in the literature. Such improvement induced by the
overwhelming health care expenditures and erroneous diagnosis. As a result,
various methodologies have been proposed to analyze the disease factors aiming
to decrease the physicians practice variation and reduce medical costs and
errors. In this paper, our main motivation is to develop an effective
intelligent medical decision support system based on data mining techniques. In
this context, five data mining classifying algorithms, with large datasets,
have been utilized to assess and analyze the risk factors statistically related
to heart diseases in order to compare the performance of the implemented
classifiers (e.g., Na\""ive Bayes, Decision Tree, Discriminant, Random Forest,
and Support Vector Machine). To underscore the practical viability of our
approach, the selected classifiers have been implemented using MATLAB tool with
two datasets. Results of the conducted experiments showed that all
classification algorithms are predictive and can give relatively correct
answer. However, the decision tree outperforms other classifiers with an
accuracy rate of 99.0% followed by Random forest. That is the case because both
of them have relatively same mechanism but the Random forest can build ensemble
of decision tree. Although ensemble learning has been proved to produce
superior results, but in our case the decision tree has outperformed its
ensemble version.

novel multi- task learning framework in which factual and counterfactual

method for learning the treatment effects using a multi-task Gaussian process

Bayesian approach allows us to compute individualized measures of confidence in
our estimates via pointwise credible intervals, which are crucial for realizing
the full potential of precision medicine. The impact of selection bias is
alleviated via a risk-based empirical Bayes method for adapting the multi-task
GP prior, which jointly minimizes the empirical error in factual outcomes and
the uncertainty in (unobserved) counter- factual outcomes. We conduct
experiments on observational datasets for an inter- ventional social program
applied to premature infants, and a left ventricular assist device applied to
cardiac patients wait-listed for a heart transplant. In both experi- ments, we

amongst base stations (BSs) of different types (termed tiers in this paper).
For instance, operators will usually not deploy a picocell in close proximity
to a macrocell, thus inducing separation amongst the locations of pico and
macrocells. This separation has recently been captured by modeling the small
cell locations by a Poisson Hole Process (PHP) with the hole centers being the
locations of the macrocells. Due to the presence of exclusion zones, the
analysis of the resulting model is significantly more complex compared to the
more popular Poisson Point Process (PPP) based models. In this paper, we derive
a tight bound on the distribution of the distance of a typical user to the
closest point of a PHP. Since the exact distribution of this distance is not
known, it is often approximated in the literature. For this model, we then
provide tight characterization of the downlink coverage probability for a
typical user in a two-tier closed-access HCN under two cases: (i) typical user
is served by the closest macrocell, and (ii) typical user is served by its
closest small cell. The proposed approach can be extended to analyze other
relevant cases of interest, e.g., coverage in a PHP-based open access HCN.

model. Cosmological backreaction describes how the mean global evolution of the
Universe deviates from the Friedmannian evolution. The analysis is based on
models of a single cosmological environment and the global ensemble of the
Szekeres models (of the Swiss-Cheese-type and Styrofoam-type). The obtained
results show that non-linear growth of cosmic structures is associated with the
growth of the spatial curvature $\Omega_{\cal R}$ (in the FLRW limit
$\Omega_{\cal R} \to \Omega_k$). If averaged over global scales the result
depends on the assumed global model of the Universe. Within the Swiss-Cheese
model, which does have a fixed background, the volume average follows the
evolution of the background, and the global spatial curvature averages out to
zero (the background model is the $\Lambda$CDM model, which is spatially flat).
In the Styrofoam-type model, which does not have a fixed background, the mean
evolution deviates from the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and the mean
spatial curvature evolves to from $\Omega_{\cal R} =0 $ at the CMB to
$\Omega_{\cal R} \sim 0.1$ at $z =0$. If the Styrofoam-type model correctly
captures evolutionary features of the real Universe then one should expect that
in our Universe, the spatial curvature should build up (local growth of cosmic
structures) and its mean global average should deviate from zero
(backreaction). As a result, this paper predicts that the low-redshift Universe
should not be spatially flat (i.e. $\Omega_k \ne 0$, even if in the early
Universe $\Omega_k = 0$) and therefore when analysing low-$z$ cosmological data
one should keep $\Omega_k$ as a free parameter and independent from the CMB
constraints.

specific heat which is important for designing of the quantum memory. We also
studied the dynamics of thermal EN and QD in Jaynes-Cumming regime including

the state of open system is entangle. According to obtained results, we did not
find out any violence oscillation in quantum discord and because entanglement
decreases with respect time, fast response to inputs is crucial for assembling

Here we elaborate well-controlled foams with concentrated emulsion and we
measure their shear elastic modulus as a function of gas fraction, bubble size
and elastic modulus of the emulsion. Such complex foams possess the elastic
features of both the bubble assembly and the interstitial matrix. Moreover,
their elastic modulus is shown to be governed by two parameters, namely the gas

finite redundancy of a continuous frame implies atomic structure of the

model simply explains the slow transmission by combined effects of saturation
and of non-instantaneous response of the medium resulting in absorption of the
front part of the incident pulse larger than that of its rear. The second
model, referred to as the coherent-population-oscillations (CPO) model,
considers light beams whose intensity is slightly pulse modulated and
attributes the time delay of the transmitted pulse to a reduction of the group
velocity. We point out some inconsistencies in the CPO model and show that the
two models lie in reality on the same hypotheses, the equations derived in the
duly rectified CPO model being local expressions of the integral equations
obtained in the incoherent bleaching model. For large modulation index, the CPO
model, based on linearized equations, breaks down. The incoherent bleaching
model then predicts that the transmitted light should vanish when the intensity
of the incident light is strictly zero. This point is confirmed by the
experiments that we have performed on ruby with square-wave incident pulses and
we show that the whole shape of the observed pulses agrees with that derived
analytically by means of the incoherent bleaching model. We also determine in
this model the corresponding evolution of the fluorescence light, which seems
to have been evidenced in other experiments.

discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering.
The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the

paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or
any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is
possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps
a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed
as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance
function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method
that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel
functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog
signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting
linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more
precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and
noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world
applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level
and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals.

away from the threshold into the more strongly turbulent regime, until they
fill the domain and a more conventional turbulence emerges. We show that the
properties of turbulence are effectively functions of the distance to
threshold, as quantified by the ion heat flux. We make quantitative comparisons

constraint for star formation and disk evolution studies. Here we present a
study of a sample of stars in the Chamaeleon I star forming region carried out
using the VLT/X-Shooter spectrograph. The sample is nearly complete down to
M~0.1Msun for the young stars still harboring a disk in this region. We derive
the stellar and accretion parameters using a self-consistent method to fit the
broad-band flux-calibrated medium resolution spectrum. The correlation between
the accretion luminosity to the stellar luminosity, and of the mass accretion
rate to the stellar mass in the logarithmic plane yields slopes of 1.9 and 2.3,
respectively. These slopes and the accretion rates are consistent with previous
results in various star forming regions and with different theoretical
frameworks. However, we find that a broken power-law fit, with a steeper slope
for stellar luminosity smaller than ~0.45 Lsun and for stellar masses smaller
than ~ 0.3 Msun, is slightly preferred according to different statistical
tests, but the single power-law model is not excluded. The steeper relation for
lower mass stars can be interpreted as a faster evolution in the past for
accretion in disks around these objects, or as different accretion regimes in
different stellar mass ranges. Finally, we find two regions on the mass
accretion versus stellar mass plane empty of objects. One at high mass
accretion rates and low stellar masses, which is related to the steeper
dependence of the two parameters we derived. The second one is just above the
observational limits imposed by chromospheric emission. This empty region is
located at M~0.3-0.4Msun, typical masses where photoevaporation is known to be
effective, and at mass accretion rates ~10^-10 Msun/yr, a value compatible with
the one expected for photoevaporation to rapidly dissipate the inner disk.

matching and an approximately minimum vertex cover in a dynamic graph. Starting
with the seminal paper by Onak and Rubinfeld [STOC 2010], this problem has
received significant attention in recent years. There remains, however, a
polynomial gap between the best known worst case update time and the best known
amortised update time for this problem, even after allowing for randomisation.
Specifically, Bernstein and Stein [ICALP 2015, SODA 2016] have the best known
worst case update time. They present a deterministic data structure with
approximation ratio $(3/2+\epsilon)$ and worst case update time
$O(m^{1/4}/\epsilon^2)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. In
recent past, Gupta and Peng [FOCS 2013] gave a deterministic data structure
with approximation ratio $(1+\epsilon)$ and worst case update time
$O(\sqrt{m}/\epsilon^2)$. No known randomised data structure beats the worst
case update times of these two results. In contrast, the paper by Onak and
Rubinfeld [STOC 2010] gave a randomised data structure with approximation ratio
$O(1)$ and amortised update time $O(\log^2 n)$, where $n$ is the number of
nodes in the graph. This was later improved by Baswana, Gupta and Sen [FOCS
2011] and Solomon [FOCS 2016], leading to a randomised date structure with
approximation ratio $2$ and amortised update time $O(1)$.
  We bridge the polynomial gap between the worst case and amortised update
times for this problem, without using any randomisation. We present a
deterministic data structure with approximation ratio $(2+\epsilon)$ and worst
case update time $O(\log^3 n)$, for all sufficiently small constants
$\epsilon$.

  Using the Characteristic Method. Applications to ICF and to Hybrid
  Fission-Fusion Systems",,,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we present a solution of the one-dimensional spherical symmetric
time-dependent neutron transport equation (written for a moving system in
lagrangian coordinates) by using the characteristic method. One of the
objectives is to overcome the negative flux problem that arises when the system
is very opaque and the angular neutron flux can become negative when it is
extrapolated in spatial meshes --- as, for example, in diamond scheme adopted
in many codes. Although there are recipes to overcome this problem, it can
completely degrade the numerical solution if repeated many times.
  The solution presented here can be easily coupled to radiation-hydrodynamics
equations, but it is necessary an additional term to maintain neutron
conservation in a moving system in lagrangian coordinates. Energy multigroup
method and a former SN method to deal with the angular variable are used, with
the assumption of isotropic scattering and the transport cross sections
approximation. An artifice is employed for emulating the neutron upscattering
when neutron energy is lower than the temperature of the medium. The
consistency of the numerical solution is checked by making at each time-step
the balance of neutrons in the system.
  Two examples of applications are shown using a
neutronic-radiation-hydrodynamic code to which the solution here presented was
incorporated: one consists of a heterogeneous pellet of DT (deuterium-tritium)
tamped by an highly-enriched uranium or plutonium (a symbiotic fusion-fission
system); and the other is a very complex and also a symbiotic
fission-fusion-fission system composed by layers of the thermonuclear fuels
LiDT, LiD and a highly-supercritical fission fuel. The last is considered an
extreme case for testing the time-dependent neutron transport solution
presented here.

peak develops and becomes stronger upon increasing the hole density by means of
a top gate electrode. This behavior is consistent with a Rashba-type spin-orbit
coupling whose strength is proportional to the perpendicular electric field,
and hence to the carrier density. By fitting the weak anti-localization peak to
a model including a dominant cubic spin-orbit coupling, we extract the
characteristic transport time scales and a spin splitting energy of ~1 meV.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reinforcement learning, agents learn by performing actions and observing
their outcomes. Sometimes, it is desirable for a human operator to
\textit{interrupt} an agent in order to prevent dangerous situations from
happening. Yet, as part of their learning process, agents may link these
interruptions, that impact their reward, to specific states and deliberately
avoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context
because agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions, but also
from those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined \emph{safe
interruptibility} for one learner, but their work does not naturally extend to
multi-agent systems. This paper introduces \textit{dynamic safe
interruptibility}, an alternative definition more suited to decentralized
learning problems, and studies this notion in two learning frameworks:
\textit{joint action learners} and \textit{independent learners}. We give
realistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic
safe interruptibility in the case of joint action learners, yet show that these
conditions are not sufficient for independent learners. We show however that if
agents can detect interruptions, it is possible to prune the observations to
ensure dynamic safe interruptibility even for independent learners.

PASCO backups need not to be updated, even when the user's password portfolio
is changed. PASCO backups can be revoked without having physical access to

properties of the active nucleus and its host galaxy. The UV-to-X-ray spectrum
in the quiescent state can be well and self-consistently described by a thermal
and a Comptonized emission from accretion disk, with blackbody dominating ~70%
of the X-rays in the 0.2-2 keV. The same model can describe the X-ray spectrum
in the flare state but the Comptonized component becomes dominant (~80%). The
best-fit implies an Eddington ratio of ~0.14, and a black hole mass of
1.7-2.8x10^6M_sun, in agreement with the estimation from the optical data
within errors. However, the best-fitting model under-predicts the optical flux
for the HST point source by a factor of ~2. The excess of nuclear optical
emission could be attributed to a nuclear stellar cluster which is frequently
seen in low mass AGNs. The X-ray to optical spectral slope (alpha_ox) is lower
than in most other active galaxies, which may be attributed to intrinsically
X-ray weakness due to very little hot and optically thin coronal emission. We
performed a pilot search for weak or hidden broad emission lines using optical
spectropolarimetry observations, but no any polarized broad lines are detected.
The host galaxy appears to be a disk galaxy with a boxy pseudobulge or nuclear
bar accounting for ~15% of the total starlight, which is consistent with the

Playing a type A arm brings it to state $0$ with probability one and not
playing it induces state transitions with arm-dependent probabilities. Whereas
playing a type B arm leads it to state $1$ with probability $1$ and not playing
it gets state that dependent on transition probabilities of arm. Further, play
of an arm generates a unit reward with a probability that depends on the state
of the arm. The belief about the state of the arm can be calculated using a
Bayesian update after every play. This RMAB has been designed for use in
recommendation systems where the user's preferences depend on the history of
recommendations. This RMAB can also be used in applications like creating of
playlists or placement of advertisements. In this paper we formulate the long
term reward maximization problem as infinite horizon discounted reward and
average reward problem. We analyse the RMAB by first studying discounted reward
scenario. We show that it is Whittle-indexable and then obtain a closed form
expression for the Whittle index for each arm calculated from the belief about
its state and the parameters that describe the arm. We next analyse the average
reward problem using vanishing discounted approach and derive the closed form
expression for Whittle index. For a RMAB to be useful in practice, we need to
be able to learn the parameters of the arms. We present an algorithm derived
from Thompson sampling scheme, that learns the parameters of the arms and also
illustrate its performance numerically.

method for determining the 3-D structure of macromolecules from noisy 2-D
images of single macromolecules whose orientations and positions are random and
unknown. One of the great opportunities in cryo-EM is to recover the structure
of macromolecules in heterogeneous samples, where multiple types or multiple
conformations are mixed together. Indeed, in recent years, many tools have been
introduced for the analysis of multiple discrete classes of molecules mixed
together in a cryo-EM experiment. However, many interesting structures have a
continuum of conformations which do not fit discrete models nicely; the
analysis of such continuously heterogeneous models has remained a more elusive
goal. In this manuscript, we propose to represent heterogeneous molecules and
similar structures as higher dimensional objects. We generalize the basic
operations used in many existing reconstruction algorithms, making our approach
generic in the sense that, in principle, existing algorithms can be adapted to
reconstruct those higher dimensional objects. As proof of concept, we present a

magnitude capacity improvement. However, it is challenging to realize a
sufficient link margin due to high path loss and blockages. To address this
difficulty, in this paper, we explore the potential gain of ultra-densification
for enhancing mmWave communications from a network-level perspective. By
deploying the mmWave base stations (BSs) in an extremely dense and amorphous
fashion, the access distance is reduced and the choice of serving BSs is
enriched for each user, which are intuitively effective for mitigating the
propagation loss and blockages. Nevertheless, co-channel interference under
this model will become a performance-limiting factor. To solve this problem, we
propose a large-scale channel state information (CSI) based interference
coordination approach. Note that the large-scale CSI is highly
location-dependent, and can be obtained with a quite low cost. Thus, the
scalability of the proposed coordination framework can be guaranteed.
Particularly, using only the large-scale CSI of interference links, a
coordinated frequency resource block allocation problem is formulated for
maximizing the minimum achievable rate of the users, which is uncovered to be a
NP-hard integer programming problem. To circumvent this difficulty, a greedy
scheme with polynomial-time complexity is proposed by adopting the bisection
method and linear integer programming tools. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed coordination scheme based on large-scale CSI only can still
offer substantial gains over the existing methods. Moreover, although the
proposed scheme is only guaranteed to converge to a local optimum, it performs
well in terms of both user fairness and system efficiency.

based on a set of low-resolution two- and three-nucleon interactions that
predict realistic saturation properties. We first investigate in detail the
convergence properties of these Hamiltonians with respect to model-space
truncations for both two- and three-body interactions. We find one particular
interaction that reproduces well the ground-state energies of all closed-shell
nuclei studied. As expected from their saturation points relative to this
interaction, the other Hamiltonians underbind nuclei, but lead to a remarkably
similar systematics of ground-state energies. Extending our calculations to
complete isotopic chains in the $sd$ and $pf$ shells with the valence-space
IM-SRG, the same interaction reproduces not only experimental ground states but
two-neutron-separation energies and first excited $2^+$ states. We also
calculate radii with the valence-space IM-SRG for the first time. Since this
particular interaction saturates at too high density, charge radii are still
too small compared with experiment. Except for this underprediction, the radii
systematics is, however, well reproduced. Our results highlight the importance
of nuclear matter as a theoretical benchmark for the development of
next-generation chiral interactions.

features and statistical feature. We evaluate the performance of the DP-miRNA
on eleven twelve data sets of varying species, including the human. The deep
neural network based classification outperformed support vector machine, neural
network, naive Baye's classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and a
hybrid system combining support vector machine and genetic algorithm.

Flux Evolution","28 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa6d61",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The curvature effect may be responsible for the steep decay phase observed in
gamma-ray bursts. For testing the curvature effect with observations, the zero
time point $t_0$ adopted to plot observer time and flux on a logarithmic scale
should be appropriately selected. In practice, however, the true $t_0$ cannot
be directly constrained from the data. Then, we move $t_0$ to a certain time in
the steep decay phase, which can be easily identified. In this situation, we
derive an analytical formula to describe the flux evolution of the steep decay
phase. The analytical formula is read as $F_\nu\propto (1+\tilde t_{\rm
obs}/{\tilde t_c})^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha(\tilde{t}_{\rm
obs})=2+{\int_{0}^{\log (1+\tilde{t}_{\rm obs}/{\tilde{t}_c})}
{\beta(\tau)d[\log(1+\tau/{\tilde{t}_c})]}}/{\log (1 + {\tilde t}_{\rm
obs}/{{\tilde t}_c})}$, where $F_\nu$ is the flux observed at frequency $\nu$,
$\tilde t_{\rm obs}$ is the observer time by setting zero time point $t_0$ at a
certain time in the steep decay phase, $\beta$ is the spectral index estimated
around $\nu$, and ${\tilde t}_c$ is the decay timescale of the phase with
$\tilde{t}_{\rm obs}{\geqslant}0$. We test the analytical formula with the data
from numerical calculations. It is found that the analytical formula presents a
well estimation about the evolution of flux shaped by the curvature effect. Our
analytical formula can be used to confront the curvature effect with
observations and estimate the decay timescale of the steep decay phase.

linear primary oscillator is investigated in shock mitigation. Apart from a
small mass and a nonlinear elastic spring of the Duffing oscillator, the HNES
is also comprised of a purely hysteretic and a linear elastic spring of
potentially negative stiffness, connected in parallel. The Bouc-Wen model is
used to describe the force produced by both the purely hysteretic and linear
elastic springs. Coupling the primary oscillator with the HNES three nonlinear
equations of motion are derived, in terms of the two displacements and the
dimensionless hysteretic variable, which are integrated numerically using the
analog equation method. The performance of the HNES is examined by quantifying
the percentage of the initially induced energy in the primary system that is
passively transferred and dissipated by the HNES. Remarkable results are
achieved for a wide range of initial input energies. The great performance of
the HNES is mostly evidenced when the linear spring stiffness takes on negative
values.
