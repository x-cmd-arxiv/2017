accretion and dynamical evolution involving turbulence, shocks, magnetic fields
and diffuse radio emission. The density and velocity structure of the gas in
the outskirts provide an effective pressure support and affect all processes
listed above. Therefore it is important to resolve and properly model the
turbulent flow in these mildly overdense and relatively large cluster regions;
this is a challenging task for hydrodynamical codes. In this work, grid-based
simulations of a galaxy cluster are presented. The simulations are performed
using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) based on the regional variability of
vorticity, and they include a subgrid scale model (SGS) for unresolved
turbulence. The implemented AMR strategy is more effective in resolving the
turbulent flow in the cluster outskirts than any previously used criterion
based on overdensity. We study a cluster undergoing a major merger, which
drives turbulence in the medium. The merger dominates the cluster energy budget
out to a few virial radii from the centre. In these regions the shocked
intra-cluster medium is resolved and the SGS turbulence is modelled, and
compared with diagnostics on larger length scale. The volume-filling factor of
the flow with large vorticity is about 60% at low redshift in the cluster
outskirts, and thus smaller than in the cluster core. In the framework of
modelling radio relics, this point suggests that upstream flow inhomogeneities
might affect pre-existing cosmic-ray population and magnetic fields, and the
resulting radio emission.

Learning Quantification from Images","Submitted to Journal Paper, 28 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Major advances have recently been made in merging language and vision
representations. But most tasks considered so far have confined themselves to
the processing of objects and lexicalised relations amongst objects (content
words). We know, however, that humans (even pre-school children) can abstract
over raw data to perform certain types of higher-level reasoning, expressed in
natural language by function words. A case in point is given by their ability
to learn quantifiers, i.e. expressions like 'few', 'some' and 'all'. From
formal semantics and cognitive linguistics, we know that quantifiers are
relations over sets which, as a simplification, we can see as proportions. For
instance, in 'most fish are red', most encodes the proportion of fish which are
red fish. In this paper, we study how well current language and vision
strategies model such relations. We show that state-of-the-art attention
mechanisms coupled with a traditional linguistic formalisation of quantifiers
gives best performance on the task. Additionally, we provide insights on the
role of 'gist' representations in quantification. A 'logical' strategy to
tackle the task would be to first obtain a numerosity estimation for the two
involved sets and then compare their cardinalities. We however argue that
precisely identifying the composition of the sets is not only beyond current
state-of-the-art models but perhaps even detrimental to a task that is most
efficiently performed by refining the approximate numerosity estimator of the
system.

establish detailed regularity properties of the corresponding $n$-particle
ground state wave functions $f^n_{P,\sigma}$ as functions of $P$ and $\sigma$.
In particular, we show that \[ |\partial_{P^j}f^{n}_{P,\sigma}(k_1,\ldots,

a numerical constant, $\lambda_0\mapsto \delta_{\lambda_0}$ is a positive
function of the maximal admissible coupling constant which satisfies
$\lim_{\lambda_0\to 0}\delta_{\lambda_0}=0$ and $\chi_{[\sigma,\kappa)}$ is the
(approximate) characteristic function of the energy region between the infrared
cut-off $\sigma$ and the ultraviolet cut-off $\kappa$. While the analysis of
the first derivative is relatively straightforward, the second derivative
requires a new strategy. By solving a non-commutative recurrence relation we
derive a novel formula for $f^n_{P,\sigma}$ with improved infrared properties.
In this representation $\partial_{P^{j'}}\partial_{P^{j}}f^n_{P,\sigma}$ is
amenable to sharp estimates obtained by iterative analytic perturbation theory
in part II of this series of papers. The bounds stated above are instrumental
for scattering theory of two electrons in the Nelson model, as explained in
part I of this series.

susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on networks with finite second
order moment of degree distribution. The eigenvector localization of the
adjacency matrix for a network gives rise to the inactive Griffiths phase
featuring slow decay of the activity localized around highly connected nodes
due to the dynamical fluctuation. We show how it dramatically changes our
understanding of SIS model, opening up new possibilities for the debate. We
derive the critical condition for Griffiths to active phase transition: on
average, an infected node can further infect another one in the characteristic
lifespan of the star subgraph composed of the node and its nearest neighbors.
The system approaches the critical point of avoiding the irreversible dynamical
fluctuation and the trap of absorbing state. As a signature of the phase
transition, the infection density of a node is not only proportional to its
degree, but also proportional to the exponentially growing lifespan of the
star. And the divergence of the average lifespan of the stars is responsible
for the vanishing threshold in the thermodynamic limit. The eigenvector
localization exponentially reinforces the infection of highly connected nodes,
while it inversely suppresses the infection of small-degree nodes.

are abundantly produced in the TPC, and given their well known energy spectrum
can be used to study MicroBooNE's detector response to low-energy electrons
(electrons with energies up to ~50 MeV). We describe the fully-automated
algorithm developed to reconstruct Michel electrons, with which a sample of
~14,000 Michel electron candidates is obtained. Most of this article is
dedicated to studying the impact of radiative photons produced by Michel
electrons on the accuracy and resolution of their energy measurement. In this
energy range, ionization and bremsstrahlung photon production contribute
similarly to electron energy loss in argon, leading to a complex electron
topology in the TPC. By profiling the performance of the reconstruction
algorithm on simulation we show that the ability to identify and include energy
deposited by radiative photons leads to a significant improvement in the energy
measurement of low-energy electrons. The fractional energy resolution we
measure improves from over 30% to ~20% when we attempt to include radiative
photons in the reconstruction. These studies are relevant to a large number of
analyses which aim to study neutrinos by measuring electrons produced by
$\nu_e$ interactions over a broad energy range.

minor-matching hypertree width, $\mu\text{-}tw$, for graphs and hypergraphs,
such that bounding the width guarantees that set of maximal independent sets
has a polynomially-sized restriction to each decomposition bag. The relaxed
conditions of the decomposition allow a much wider class of graphs and
hypergraphs of bounded width compared to other tree decompositions. We show
that, for fixed $k$, there are $2^{(1 - \frac1k + o(1)){n \choose 2}}$
$n$-vertex graphs of minor-matching hypertree width at most $k$. A number of
problems including Maximum Independence Set, $k$-Colouring, and Homomorphism of
uniform hypergraphs permit polynomial-time solutions for hypergraphs with
bounded minor-matching hypertree width and bounded rank. We show that for any
given $k$ and any graph $G$, it is possible to construct a decomposition of
minor-matching hypertree width at most $O(k^3)$, or to prove that
$\mu\text{-}tw(G) > k$ in time $n^{O(k^3)}$. This is done by presenting a
general algorithm for approximating the hypertree width of well-behaved
measures, and reducing $\mu\text{-}tw$ to such measure. The result relating the
restriction of the maximal independent sets to a set $S$ with the set of
induced matchings intersecting $S$ in graphs, and minor matchings intersecting
$S$ in hypergraphs, might be of independent interest.

benchmark points with different mass hypotheses are assumed for the analysis.
The Higgs mass $m_H$ is assumed to vary within the range 150-300 GeV in

possible for either one of the additional singlet-like scalar and pseudoscalar
Higgs bosons to be almost degenerate in mass with the ~125 GeV SM-like Higgs
state. In the real NMSSM (rNMSSM), when the mass difference between two scalar
states is comparable to their individual total decay widths, the quantum
mechanical interference, due to the relevant diagonal as well as off-diagonal
terms in the propagator matrix, between them can become sizable. This
possibility invalidates usage of the narrow width approximation (NWA) to
compute the cross section for the production of a di-photon pair with a given
invariant mass via resonant Higgs boson(s) in the gluon fusion process at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). When, motivated by the baryon asymmetry of the
universe, CP-violating (CPV) phases are explicitly invoked in the Higgs sector
of the NMSSM, all the interaction eigenstates mix to give five CP-indefinite
physical Higgs bosons. In this scenario, the interference effects due the
off-diagonal terms in the Higgs mass matrix that mix the pseudoscalar-like
state with the SM-like one can also become significant, when these two are
sufficiently mass-degenerate. We perform a detailed analysis, in both the real
and complex NMSSM, of these interference effects, when the full propagator
matrix is taken into account, in the production of a photon pair with an
invariant mass near 125 GeV through gluon fusion. We find that these effects
can account for up to ~40% of the total cross section for certain model
parameter configurations. We also investigate how such mutually interfering
states contributing to the ~125 GeV signal observed at the LHC can be
distinguished from a single resonance.

electric galvanic distortion but does not contain any impedance amplitude
information and therefore cannot quantify resistivity without complementary
data. We formulate a complete impedance tensor decomposition into the PT and a
new Amplitude Tensor (AT) that is shown to be complementary and mathematically
independent to the PT. We show that for the special cases of 1D and 2D models,
the geometric AT parameters (strike and skew angles) converge to PT parameters
and the singular values of the AT correspond to the impedance amplitudes of the
transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes. In all cases, we show that
the AT contains both galvanic and inductive amplitudes, the latter of which is
argued to be physically related to the inductive information of the PT. The
geometric parameters of the inductive AT and the PT represent the same geometry
of the subsurface conductivity distribution that is affected by induction
processes, and therefore we hypothesise that geometric PT parameters can be
used to approximate the inductive AT. Then, this hypothesis leads to the
estimation of the galvanic AT which is equal to the galvanic electric
distortion tensor at the lowest measured period. This estimation of the
galvanic distortion departs from the common assumption to consider 1D or 2D
regional structures and can be applied for general 3D subsurfaces. We
demonstrate exemplarily with an explicit formulation how our hypothesis can be
used to recover the galvanic electric anisotropic distortion for 2D
subsurfaces, which was, until now, believed to be indeterminable for 2D data.
Moreover, we illustrate the AT as a mapping tool and we compare it to the PT
with both synthetic and real data examples. Lastly, we argue that the AT can

that under fairly weak assumptions on the mobility pattern, the expected reward

packing densities of 1324, 1342, and 2413. All our bounds are within $10^{-4}$

fairly complete picture of all 4-point packing densities. We also provide new
upper bounds for several small permutations of length at least five. Our main

are being dedicated to accurate predictions for the power spectrum of density
perturbations. While this observable is known to be sensitive to the
gravitational theory, its efficiency as a diagnostic for gravity is
significantly reduced when Solar System constraints are strictly adhered to. We
show that this problem can be overcome by studying weigthed density fields. We
propose a transformation of the density field for which the impact of modified
gravity on the power spectrum can be increased by more than a factor of three.
The signal is not only amplified, but the modified gravity features are shifted
to larger scales which are less affected by baryonic physics. Furthermore, the
overall signal-to-noise increases, which in principle makes identifying
signatures of modified gravity with future galaxy surveys more feasible. While
our analysis is focused on modified gravity, the technique can be applied to
other problems in cosmology, such as the detection of neutrinos, the effects of
baryons or baryon acoustic oscillations.

VLA (NRAO) and an image at 100 GHz of the central region using the ALMA array.
Simultaneously with the VLA observations we performed HST WFPC3 near infrared
and Chandra X-ray observations of the central region of the nebula. In addition
we produced a new UV image of the Crab nebula at 291 nm by co-adding 75
individual exposures of the Optical-UV Monitor on board XMM-Newton. The
high-angular resolution and high-dynamic range radio image at 3 GHz allowed us
to improve the detection and characterization of peculiar morphological
features including arches with foot brightening and intercrossed loop-like
structures, likely originating in plasma confined to magnetic field lines.
Based on the new radio image, we carried out a detailed multiwavelength
correlation. In the central area, the comparison of the almost simultaneous
images confirms that the wisps in the three spectral ranges do not generally
coincide in location, the radio emission being the most discordant, which is
suggestive of the existence of two different synchrotron components. The X-ray
pulsar jet does not have a radio counterpart.
  Instead, another jet-like feature is seen in radio, though with different
curvature and starting point.

by sources emitting ultraviolet and higher energy photons. This was the final
phenomenon to globally affect all the baryons (visible matter) in the Universe.
It is referred to as cosmic reionization and is an integral component of
cosmology. It is broadly expected that intrinsically faint galaxies were the
primary ionizing sources due to their abundance in this epoch. However, at the
highest redshifts ($z>7.5$; lookback time 13.1 Gyr), all galaxies with
spectroscopic confirmations to date are intrinsically bright and, therefore,
not necessarily representative of the general population. Here, we report the
unequivocal spectroscopic detection of a low luminosity galaxy at $z>7.5$. We
detected the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line at $\sim 10504$ {\AA} in two separate
observations with MOSFIRE on the Keck I Telescope and independently with the
Hubble Space Telescope's slit-less grism spectrograph, implying a source
redshift of $z = 7.640 \pm 0.001$. The galaxy is gravitationally magnified by
the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ($z = 0.545$), with an estimated
intrinsic luminosity of $M_{AB} = -19.6 \pm 0.2$ mag and a stellar mass of

quantum chaos in many-body systems. The usual way they are introduced is via a
quantization of classical Lyapunov growth, which measures the divergence of
classical trajectories in phase space due to the butterfly effect. However, it
is not obvious how exactly they capture the sensitivity of a quantum system to
its initial conditions beyond the classical limit. In this paper, we analyze
sensitivity to initial conditions in the quantum regime by recasting OTO
operators for many-body systems using various formulations of quantum
mechanics. Notably, we utilize the Wigner phase space formulation to derive an
$\hbar$-expansion of the OTO operator for spatial degrees of freedom, and a
large spin $1/s$-expansion for spin degrees of freedom. We find in each case
that the leading term is the Lyapunov growth for the classical limit of the
system and argue that quantum corrections become dominant at around the
scrambling time, which is also when we expect the OTO operator to saturate. We
also express the OTO operator in terms of propagators and see from a different
point of view how it is a quantum generalization of the divergence of classical
trajectories.

observations in stars are more difficult and, until recently, plagued by small
number statistics. We wish to exploit the Gaia ESO Survey (GES) data to study
the behaviour of sulfur and zinc abundances of a large number of Galactic
stars, in a homogeneous way. By using the UVES spectra of the GES sample, we
are able to assemble a sample of 1301 Galactic stars, including stars in open
and globular clusters in which both sulfur and zinc were measured. We confirm
the results from the literature that sulfur behaves as an alpha-element. We
find a large scatter in [Zn/Fe] ratios among giant stars around solar
metallicity. The lower ratios are observed in giant stars at Galactocentric
distances less than 7.5 kpc. No such effect is observed among dwarf stars,
since they do not extend to that radius. Given the sample selection, giants and
dwarfs are observed at different Galactic locations, and it is plausible, and
compatible with simple calculations, that Zn-poor giants trace a younger
population more polluted by SN Ia yields. It is necessary to extend
observations in order to observe both giants and dwarfs at the same Galactic
location. Further theoretical work on the evolution of zinc is also necessary.

aim of predicting the properties of its progenitors all the way from $z \sim
20$ to $z = 0$. We apply GAMESH (Graziani et al. 2015) to a high resolution
N-Body simulation following the formation of a MW-type halo and we investigate
its properties at $z \sim 0$ and its progenitors in $0 < z < 4$. Our model
predicts the observed galaxy main sequence, the mass-metallicity and the
fundamental plane of metallicity relations in $0 < z < 4$. It also reproduces
the stellar mass evolution of candidate MW progenitors in $0 \lesssim z
\lesssim 2.5$, although the star formation rate and gas fraction of the
simulated galaxies follow a shallower redshift dependence. We find that while
the MW star formation and chemical enrichment are dominated by the contribution
of galaxies hosted in Lyman $\alpha$-cooling halos, at z > 6 the contribution
of star forming mini-halos is comparable to the star formation rate along the
MW merger tree. These systems might then provide an important contribution in
the early phases of reionization. A large number of mini-halos with old stellar
populations, possibly Population~III stars, are dragged into the MW or survive
in the Local Group. At low redshift dynamical effects, such as halo mergers,
tidal stripping and halo disruption redistribute the baryonic properties among
halo families. These results are critically discussed in light of future
improvements including a more sophisticated treatment of radiative feedback and
inhomogeneous metal enrichment.

in core-collapse supernovae. The acoustic mechanism is an alternative to the
neutrino-heating mechanism. It was proposed by Burrows et al., who claimed that
acoustic waves emitted by $g$-mode oscillations in proto-neutron stars (PNS)
energize a stalled shock wave and eventually induce an explosion. Previous
works mainly studied to which extent the $g$-modes are excited in the PNS. In
this paper, on the other hand, we investigate how strong the acoustic wave
needs to be if it were to revive a stalled shock wave. By adding the acoustic
power as a new axis, we draw a critical surface, an extension of the critical
curve commonly employed in the context of neutrino heating. We perform both 1D
and 2D parametrized simulations, in which we inject acoustic waves from the
inner boundary. In order to quantify the power of acoustic waves, we use the
extended Myers theory to take neutrino reactions into proper account. We find
for the 1D simulations that rather large acoustic powers are required to
relaunch the shock wave, since the additional heating provided by the secondary
shocks developed from acoustic waves is partially canceled by the neutrino
cooling that is also enhanced. In 2D, the required acoustic powers are
consistent with those of Burrows et al. Our results seem to imply, however,
that it is the sum of neutrino heating and acoustic powers that matters for
shock revival.

star it is well suited for spectroscopic analysis using integral field
spectrographs. We aim to refine the atmospheric properties of this and to
further constrain the architecture of the system by searching for additional
companions. Using the SPHERE instrument at the VLT we extend the spectral
coverage of the planet to the complete Y- to H-band range and provide
photometry in the K12-bands (2.11, 2.25 micron). The object is compared to
other cool and peculiar dwarfs. Furthermore, the posterior probability
distributions of cloudy and clear atmospheric models are explored using MCMC.
We verified our methods by determining atmospheric parameters for the two
benchmark brown dwarfs Gl 570D and HD 3651B. For probing the innermost region
for additional companions, archival VLT-NACO (L') SAM data is used. We present
the first spectrophotometric measurements in the Y- and K-bands for the planet
and revise its J-band flux to values 40% fainter than previous measurements.
Cloudy models with uniform cloud coverage provide a good match to the data. We
derive the temperature, radius, surface gravity, metallicity and cloud
sedimentation parameter f_sed. We find that the atmosphere is highly
super-solar (Fe/H~1.0) with an extended, thick cloud cover of small particles.
The model radius and surface gravity suggest planetary masses of about 9 M_jup.
The evolutionary model only provides a lower mass limit of >2 M_jup (for pure
hot-start). The cold-start model cannot explain the planet's luminosity. The
SPHERE and NACO/SAM detection limits probe the 51 Eri system at Solar System
scales and exclude brown-dwarf companions more massive than 20 M_jup beyond

of star clusters and examine one of the formation hypothesis of present-day
metal-poor globular clusters. We find that frequent mergers in high-redshift
proto-galaxies could provide a fertile environment to produce long-lasting
bound star clusters. The violent merger event disturbs the gravitational
potential and pushes a large gas mass of ~> 1e5-6 Msun collectively to high
density, at which point it rapidly turns into stars before stellar feedback can
stop star formation. The high dynamic range of the reported simulation is
critical in realizing such dense star-forming clouds with a small dynamical
timescale, t_ff <~ 3 Myr, shorter than most stellar feedback timescales. Our
simulation then allows us to trace how clusters could become virialized and
tightly-bound to survive for up to ~420 Myr till the end of the simulation.
Because the cluster's tightly-bound core was formed in one short burst, and the
nearby older stars originally grouped with the cluster tend to be
preferentially removed, at the end of the simulation the cluster has a small
age spread.

feature in two ways: On the one hand, we make use of recent techniques for the
classification of SPT phases using matrix product states in order to identify
the phases in the effective model with those in the underlying physical system,
employing Kuenneth's theorem for cohomology. As an intuitive paradigmatic model
we exemplify the developed methodology by investigating the bi-layered
delta-chain. For strong ferromagnetic inter-layer couplings, we find the system
to transit into exactly the same phase as an effective spin 1 model. However,
for weak but finite coupling strength, we identify a symmetry broken phase

  Neighbors",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In various economic environments, people observe other people with whom they
strategically interact. We can model such information-sharing relations as an
information network, and the strategic interactions as a game on the network.
When any two agents in the network are connected either directly or indirectly
in a large network, empirical modeling using an equilibrium approach can be
cumbersome, since the testable implications from an equilibrium generally
involve all the players of the game, whereas a researcher's data set may
contain only a fraction of these players in practice. This paper develops a
tractable empirical model of linear interactions where each agent, after
observing part of his neighbors' types, not knowing the full information
network, uses best responses that are linear in his and other players' types
that he observes, based on simple beliefs about the other players' strategies.
We provide conditions on information networks and beliefs such that the best
responses take an explicit form with multiple intuitive features. Furthermore,
the best responses reveal how local payoff interdependence among agents is
translated into local stochastic dependence of their actions, allowing the
econometrician to perform asymptotic inference without having to observe all
the players in the game or having to know the precise sampling process.

Recent blind line scans circumvent the spectroscopic redshift requirement,

  Our aim is to detect emission lines present in continuum oriented
observations. The detection of such lines provides spectroscopic redshift and
yields properties of the galaxies.
  We perform a search for emission lines in the ALMA observations of five
Frontier Fields clusters and assess the reliability of our detection by
associating line candidates with detected galaxies in deep near-infrared
imaging.
  We find 26 significant emission lines candidates, with observed line fluxes
between 0.2-4.6 Jy km s$^{-1}$ and velocity dispersions (FWHM) of 25-600 km
s$^{-1}$. Nine of these candidates lie nearby to near-infrared sources,
boosting their reliability; in six cases the observed line frequency and
strength are consistent with expectations given the photometric redshift and
properties of the galaxy counterparts. We present redshift identifications,
magnifications and molecular gas estimates for the galaxies with identified
lines. We show that two of these candidates likely originate from starburst
galaxies, one of which is a jellyfish galaxy, while another two are consistent
with being main sequence galaxies based in their depletion times.
  This work highlights the degree to which serendipitous emission lines can be
discovered in large mosaic continuum observations when deep ancillary data are
available. The low number of high-significance line detections, however,
confirms that such surveys are not as optimal as blind line scans. We stress
that Monte Carlo simulations should be used to assess the line detections
significances, since using the negative noise suffers from stochasticity and
incurs larger uncertainties.

down through gluinos to the lightest superpartner (LSP). In both simplified

explore the simulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) on infinite lattices
with TNs, i.e., fermionic matter fields coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field,
directly in the thermodynamic limit. With this idea in mind we first consider a
gauge-invariant iDMRG simulation of the Schwinger model -i.e., QED in
$(1+1)d$-. After giving a precise description of the numerical method, we
benchmark our simulations by computing the substracted chiral condensate in the
continuum, in good agreement with other approaches. Our simulations of the
Schwinger model allow us to build intuition about how a simulation should
proceed in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Based on this, we propose a variational ansatz
using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) to describe the ground
state of $(2+1)d$ QED. The ansatz includes $U(1)$ gauge symmetry at the level
of the tensors, as well as fermionic (matter) and bosonic (gauge) degrees of

necessary ingredients for the simulation of $(2+1)d$ QED are, a priori, already
in place, paving the way for future upcoming results.

analogue, known as metasurfaces, has attracted progressively increasing
attention in recent years due to the ease of fabrication and smaller insertion
losses, while enabling an unprecedented control over spatial distributions of
transmitted and reflected optical fields. Metasurfaces represent optically thin
planar arrays of resonant subwavelength elements that can be arranged in a
strictly or quasi periodic fashion, or even in an aperiodic manner, depending
on targeted optical wavefronts to be molded with their help. This paper reviews
a broad subclass of metasurfaces, viz. gradient metasurfaces, which are devised
to exhibit spatially varying optical responses resulting in spatially varying
amplitudes, phases and polarizations of scattered fields. Starting with
introducing the concept of gradient metasurfaces, we present classification of
different metasurfaces from the viewpoint of their responses, differentiating
electrical-dipole, geometric, reflective and Huygens' metasurfaces. The
fundamental building blocks essential for the realization of metasurfaces are
then discussed in order to elucidate the underlying physics of various physical
realizations of both plasmonic and purely dielectric metasurfaces. We then
overview the main applications of gradient metasurfaces, including waveplates,
flat lenses, spiral phase plates, broadband absorbers, color printing,
holograms, polarimeters and surface wave couplers. The review is terminated
with a short section on recently developed nonlinear metasurfaces, followed by
the outlook presenting our view on possible future developments and
perspectives for future applications.

Specifically, we propose structural factorization machines (SFMs) that learn

complexity of SFMs is linear in the number of parameters, which make SFMs

The effectiveness
of previous approaches is analyzed according to the form of supervision

semantic subspace explained by training classes. Thus, the former is able to
constrain the whole space but lacks the ability to model semantic correlations.
The latter addresses this issue but leaves part of the semantic space
unsupervised. This complementarity is exploited in a new convolutional neural
network (CNN) framework, which proposes the use of semantics as constraints for
recognition.Although a CNN trained for classification has no transfer ability,
this can be encouraged by learning an hidden semantic layer together with a
semantic code for classification. Two forms of semantic constraints are then
introduced. The first is a loss-based regularizer that introduces a
generalization constraint on each semantic predictor. The second is a codeword
regularizer that favors semantic-to-class mappings consistent with prior
semantic knowledge while allowing these to be learned from data. Significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art are achieved on several datasets.

a cosmological constant. Using the holographic feature of this effective energy
density, we introduce natural IR and UV cut-offs which depend on the GUP based
effective equation of state. Moreover, we propose a solution to the
cosmological constant problem. This solution is based on the result that the
Einstein equations just couple to the tiny holographic based surface energy
density (cosmological constant) induced by the deformation parameter, rather
than the large quantum gravitational based volume energy density (vacuum
energy) having contributions of order $M_P^4$.

as cryptography, black hole physics, random matrix theory and Monte Carlo
sampling. In quantum systems, random operations can be obtained via random
circuits thanks to so-called q-designs, and play a central role in the fast
scrambling conjecture for black holes. Here we consider a more physically
motivated way of generating random evolutions by exploiting the many-body
dynamics of a quantum system driven with stochastic external pulses. We combine
techniques from quantum control, open quantum systems and exactly solvable
models (via the Bethe-Ansatz) to generate Haar-uniform random operations in
driven many-body systems. We show that any fully controllable system converges
to a unitary q-design in the long-time limit. Moreover, we study the
convergence time of a driven spin chain by mapping its random evolution into a
semigroup with an integrable Liouvillean and finding its gap. Remarkably, we
find via Bethe-Ansatz techniques that the gap is independent of q. We use
mean-field techniques to argue that this property may be typical for other
controllable systems, although we explicitly construct counter-examples via
symmetry breaking arguments to show that this is not always the case. Our
findings open up new physical methods to transform classical randomness into
quantum randomness, via a combination of quantum many-body dynamics and random
driving.

by the observation that the Ginibre ensemble with $N$ points is asymptotically
close to the restriction of the infinite Ginibre ensemble to the disk of area

symmetric non-singular black hole. We used a modified Hayward metric for a
description of a non-singular black hole. We assume that the mass parameter of
this metric depends on the advanced time, and choose this dependence so that it
properly reproduces both black hole formation and its subsequent evaporation.
We consider a quantum massless scalar field propagating in this geometry and
use 2D approximation for the calculation of the quantum average of the
stress-energy tensor. For the calculation of this quantity it is sufficient to
find a map between the Killing times $u_+$ and $u_-$ at the future and past
null infinities, established by the propagation of the radial null rays. In
this formalism the quantum energy flux at the future null infinity can be
expressed in terms of the function $u_+(u_-)$ and its derivatives. We developed
a special formalism, which allows one to reduce the problem of the calculation
of the quantum energy flux and other observables to a solution of a simple set
of ordinary differential equations. We used this approach to study quantum
effects in two cases: i) with the trivial, $\alpha=1$ and ii) the non-trivial,
$\alpha\ne1$, redshift function. In both cases there exists an outburst of the
quantum energy radiation from the inner domain of the black hole, close to the
inner part of its apparent horizon. For $\alpha=1$ this outburst is
exponentially large. It is a direct consequence of the so-called mass inflation
effect. We showed, that this severe problem can be solved by a proper choice of
the redshift function. However, even in this case the emitted energy can be
much larger than the initial mass of the evaporating black hole. This means
that for a construction of a self-consistent model of a non-singular
evaporating black hole the back-reaction effects are highly important.

complete chatter (a.k.a. Zeno behavior), i.e. an infinite sequence of
collisions accumulating in finite time. Alternatively, such systems may also
exhibit a finite sequence of collisions followed by separation (sometimes
called incomplete chatter). Earlier works concerning the chattering of slender
rods in two dimensions determined the exact range of model parameters, where
complete chatter is possible. We revisit and slightly extend these results.
Then the bulk of the paper examines the chattering of three-dimensional objects
with multiple points hitting an immobile plane almost simultaneously. In
contrast to rods, the motion of these systems is complex, nonlinear, and
sensitive to initial conditions and model parameters due to the possibility of
various impact sequences. These difficulties explain why we model this
phenomenon as a nondeterministic discrete dynamical system. We simplify the
analysis by assuming linearized kinematics, frictionless interaction, by
neglecting the effect of external forces, and by investigating objects with
rotational symmetry. Application and extension of the theory of common
invariant cones of multiple linear operators enable us to find sufficient
conditions of the existence of initial conditions, which give rise to complete
chatter. Additional analytical and numerical investigations predict that our
sufficient conditions are indeed exact, moreover solving a simple eigenvalue
problem appears to be enough to judge the possibility of complete chatter.

time-varying correlation between mobility patterns of different nodes, and
their variation ranging from macro-mobility (kilometer range) to micro-mobility
(sub-meter range). Current models have strong limitations in doing so: the
widely used reference-based models, such as the Reference Point Group Mobility
(RPGM), lack flexibility and accuracy, while the more sophisticated rule-based
(i.e. behavioral) models are complex to set-up and tune. This paper introduces
a new rule-based Modular Mobility Model, named Mo3, that provides accuracy and
flexibility on par with behavioral models, while preserving the intuitiveness
of the reference-based approach, and is based on five rules: 1) Individual
Mobility, 2) Correlated Mobility, 3) Collision Avoidance, 4) Obstacle Avoidance
and 5) Upper Bounds Enforcement. Mo3 avoids introducing acceleration vectors to
define rules, as behavioral models do, and this significantly reduces
complexity. Rules are mapped one-to-one onto five modules, that can be
independently enabled or replaced. Comparison of time-correlation features
obtained with Mo3 vs. reference-based models, and in particular RPGM, in pure
micro-mobility and mixed macro-mobility / micro-mobility scenarios, shows that
Mo3 and RPGM generate mobility patterns with similar topological properties
(intra-group and inter-group distances), but that Mo3 preserves a spatial
correlation that is lost in RPGM - at no price in terms of complexity - making
it suitable for adoption in 5G and beyond 5G.

temporal fusing. First, ROI cropping nets (ROI Nets) are designed to make sure
specifically interested regions of faces are learned independently; each
sub-region has a local convolutional neural network (CNN) - an ROI Net, whose
convolutional filters will only be trained for the corresponding region.
Second, multi-label learning is employed to integrate the outputs of those
individual ROI cropping nets, which learns the inter-relationships of various
AUs and acquires global features across sub-regions for AU detection. Finally,
the optimal selection of multiple LSTM layers to form the best LSTM Net is
carried out to best fuse temporal features, in order to make the AU prediction
the most accurate. The proposed approach is evaluated on two popular AU
detection datasets, BP4D and DISFA, outperforming the state of the art

is challenging because the agent has to learn to collectively complete multiple

that there leaves enough time for commute between arrival and hotel check-in.
This paper addresses this challenge by formulating the task in the mathematical
framework of options over Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and proposing a
hierarchical deep reinforcement learning approach to learning a dialogue
manager that operates at different temporal scales. The dialogue manager
consists of: (1) a top-level dialogue policy that selects among subtasks or
options, (2) a low-level dialogue policy that selects primitive actions to
complete the subtask given by the top-level policy, and (3) a global state
tracker that helps ensure all cross-subtask constraints be satisfied.
Experiments on a travel planning task with simulated and real users show that
our approach leads to significant improvements over three baselines, two based
on handcrafted rules and the other based on flat deep reinforcement learning.

is determined by a number of narrow resonances together with the DC component
and the tails of the two broad resonances at E_{c.m.} = 1323 and 1487 keV.
Measurement through the direct detection of the 19F recoil ions with the
European Recoil separator for Nuclear Astrophysics (ERNA) were performed. The
reaction was initiated by a 15N beam impinging onto a 4He windowless gas
target. The observed yield of the resonances at Ec.m. = 1323 and 1487 keV is
used to determine their widths in the {\alpha} and {\gamma} channels. We show
that a direct measurement of the cross section of the

significant difference is found for the 1323 keV resonance {\Gamma}_{\alpha} .
The revision of the widths of the two more relevant broad resonances in the

quantum state is always in a process, i.e. moving around in the ontic state

ontic state, but depend probabilistically on the entire path the system takes
during the measurement process. Consequently, we explain how, in our model,
quantum states can neither be classified as ontic nor epistemic in the sense of
knowledge about an underlying reality. In our model, quantum probabilities
describes our (objective) knowledge about measurement outcomes. We also look at
two hybrid models where either the preparation or measurement do follow the

explicit transpositions (permutations) and extra workspace, and reducing the
overhead of memory movement that is incurred. Performance benefits are
demonstrated with a performance model as well as in practice on modern single
core, multicore, and distributed memory parallel architectures, achieving up to
1.3x speedup. The resulting implementations can serve as a drop-in replacement
for various applications with significant speedup.

achieve data-race freedom, which is important for correctness and safety. In
actor-based systems, messages are exchanged concurrently but executed
sequentially by the receiving actor. By relying on isolation and non-sharing,
an actor can access its own state without fear of data-races, and the internal
behavior of an actor can be reasoned about sequentially.
  However, actor isolation is sometimes too strong to express useful patterns.
For example, letting the iterator of a data-collection alias the internal
structure of the collection allows a more efficient implementation than if each
access requires going through the interface of the collection. With full
isolation, in order to maintain sequential reasoning the iterator must be made
part of the collection, which bloats the interface of the collection and means
that a client must have access to the whole data-collection in order to use the
iterator.
  In this paper, we propose a programming language construct that enables a
relaxation of isolation but without sacrificing sequential reasoning. We
formalise the mechanism in a simple lambda calculus with actors and passive
objects, and show how an actor may leak parts of its internal state while
ensuring that any interaction with this data is still synchronised.

has resulted in many promising prototype tools. Most of these tools allow users
to express hybrid system as automata with a set of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) associated with each state, as well as rules for transitions
between states. Significant effort goes into developing and verifying and
correctly implementing those tools. As such, it is desirable to expand the
scope of applicability tools of such as far as possible. With this goal, we
show how compile-time transformations can be used to extend the basic hybrid
ODE formalism traditionally supported in hybrid reachability tools such as
SpaceEx or Flow*. The extension supports certain types of partial derivatives
and equational constraints. These extensions allow users to express, among
other things, the Euler-Lagrangian equation, and to capture practically
relevant constraints that arise naturally in mechanical systems. Achieving this
level of expressiveness requires using a binding time-analysis (BTA), program
differentiation, symbolic Gaussian elimination, and abstract interpretation
using interval analysis. Except for BTA, the other components are either
readily available or can be easily added to most reachability tools. The paper
therefore focuses on presenting both the declarative and algorithmic
specifications for the BTA phase, and establishes the soundness of the
algorithmic specifications with respect to the declarative one.

Our simulations also probe impacts of different sub-grid assumptions, i.e., SF
efficiency and cosmic reionization, on SF histories in the first galaxies. We
find that star formation occurs intermittently due to supernova (SN) feedback
at z > 10, and then it proceeds more smoothly as the halo mass grows at lower
redshifts. Galactic disks are destroyed due to SN feedback, while galaxies in
simulations with no-feedback or lower SF efficiency models can sustain galactic
disk for long periods > 10 Myr. The expulsion of gas at the galactic center
also affects the inner dark matter density profile. However, SN feedback does
not seem to keep the shallow profile of dark matter for a long period. Our
simulated galaxies in Halo-11 and Halo-12 reproduce the star formation rates
(SFR) and stellar masses of observed Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at z = 7-8
fairly well given observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the
effect of UV background radiation on star formation as an external feedback
source, and find that earlier reionization extends the quenching time of star
formation due to photo-ionization heating, but does not affect the stellar mass

in modeling hydrodynamics. In the past decade, it has been extended to simulate
the rarefied gas flow beyond the Navier-Stokes level, either by using the
high-order Gauss-Hermite quadrature, or by introducing the relaxation time that
is a function of the gas-wall distance. While the former method, with a limited
number of discrete velocities (i.e. D2Q36), is accurate up to the early
transition flow regime, the latter method, with the same discrete velocities as
that used in simulating hydrodynamics (i.e. D2Q9), is accurate up to the
free-molecular flow regime in the Poiseuille flow between two parallel plates.
This is quite astonishing in the sense that more discrete velocities are less
accurate. In this paper, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook kinetic equation
accurately via the discrete velocity method, we find that the accuracy of the
lattice Boltzmann method is reduced significantly in the simulation of rarefied
gas flows through the rough surface and porous media. Our simulation results
could serve as benchmarking cases for future development of the lattice
Boltzmann method for modeling and simulation of rarefied gas flows in complex

reveal that the optimal number of ADC bits is logarithmically proportional to
the RF chain's signal-to-noise ratio raised to the 1/3 power. Using the
solutions, two proposed BA algorithms minimize the mean square quantization
error of received analog signals under a total ADC power constraint.

system tradeoffs and serves as the lower bound. Simulation results demonstrate
that the BA algorithms outperform a fixed-ADC approach in both spectral and

power constraint equivalent to that of fixed 4-bit ADCs, the revised BA
algorithm makes the quantization error negligible while achieving 22% better

Spectroscopic data under various experimental parameters all showed that the
contrast of EIT transparency as a function of the probe intensity is initially
enhanced, reaches a maximum value and then decays gradually. The contrast of
spectral profile at the optimum probe field intensity is enhanced by $2-4$

from \Planck\ and future experiments will be able to confirm or constrain
physical models for modulation. Fitting several such models to the \Planck\
temperature data allows us to provide predictions for polarization asymmetry.
While for some models and parameters \Planck\ polarization will decrease error
bars on the modulation amplitude by only a small percentage, we show,
importantly, that cosmic-variance-limited (and in some cases even \Planck)
polarization data can decrease the errors by considerably better than the
expectation of $\sqrt 2$ based on simple $\ell$-space arguments. We project
that if the primordial fluctuations are truly modulated (with parameters as
indicated by \Planck\ temperature data) then \Planck\ will be able to make a
2$\sigma$ detection of the modulation model with 20--75\% probability,
increasing to 45--99\% when cosmic-variance-limited polarization is considered.

find that both streams have the same stellar population based on the Bayesian
model selection method, suggesting that they originated from a tidal
interaction between NGC4631 and a single dwarf satellite. The expected
progenitor has a positively skewed metallicity distribution function with
[M/H]_EAP=-0.92 with the 90% credible intervals of [-1.46, -0.51]. The stellar
mass of the progenitor is estimated as 3.7 x 10e+8 Msun with the 90% credible
intervals of [5.8 x 10e+6, 8.6 x 10e+9] Msun based on the mass-metallicity
relation for Local group dwarf galaxies. This is in good agreement with an
initial stellar mass of the progenitor presumed in the previous N-body
simulation.

adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDP, stochastic spike
synchronization (SSS) between noise-induced spikings of subthreshold neurons
was found to occur in a range of intermediate noise intensities through
competition between the constructive and the destructive roles of noise. Here,
we investigate the effect of additive STDP on the SSS by varying the noise
intensity. Occurrence of a ""Matthew"" effect in synaptic plasticity is found due
to a positive feedback process. As a result, good synchronization gets better
via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad
synchronization gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Emergence of LTP and
LTD of synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via microscopic studies
based on the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IISRs
(instantaneous individual spike rates) as well as the distributions of time
delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times. Furthermore, the
effects of multiplicative STDP (which depends on the states) on the SSS are
also studied and discussed in comparison with the case of additive STDP.

the gas dynamical model on the mesh size and time step scales. With the
implementation of particle transport and collision in a time-dependent flux
function, the UGKS can recover multiple flow physics from the kinetic particle
transport to the hydrodynamic wave propagation. In comparison with direct
simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), the equations-based UGKS can use the implicit
techniques in the updates of macroscopic conservative variables and microscopic
distribution function. The implicit UGKS significantly increases the
convergence speed for steady flow computations, especially in the highly
rarefied and near continuum regime. In order to further improve the
computational efficiency, for the first time a geometric multigrid technique is
introduced into the implicit UGKS, where the prediction step for the
equilibrium state and the evolution step for the distribution function are both
treated with multigrid acceleration. The multigrid implicit UGKS (MIUGKS) is
used in the non-equilibrium flow study, which includes microflow, such as
lid-driven cavity flow and the flow passing through a finite-length flat plate,
and high speed one, such as supersonic flow over a square cylinder. The MIUGKS
shows 5 to 9 times efficiency increase over the previous implicit scheme. For
the low speed microflow, the efficiency of MIUGKS is several orders of
magnitude higher than the DSMC. Even for the hypersonic flow at Mach number 5
and Knudsen number 0.1, the MIUGKS is still more than 100 times faster than the
DSMC method for a convergent steady state solution.

dipole spin resonance (EDSR) in the metallic regime and (2) the optical
conductivity in the Mott-insulating phase above the optical gap. In both cases,
we calculate qualitatively the effects of SOC and ZS and how they depend on the
relative angle between the SOC vector and the magnetic field direction. First,
we investigate the spin resonance without electron correlation (the Hubbard
parameter $U=0$). Although, neither SOC nor ZS causes any resonance by itself
in the optical conductivity, the EDSR becomes possible when both of them exist.
The resulting contribution to the optical conductivity is analyzed
analytically. The effect of $U$ on the spin resonance is also studied with a
numerical method. It is found that at half-filling, the resonance is first
enhanced for small $U$ and then suppressed when the optical gap is large
enough. In the strong coupling limit $U \rightarrow \infty$ at half-filling, we
also refer to the resonance between the lower and upper Hubbard bands appearing
at $\omega \sim U$, above the optical gap. A large magnetic field tends to
suppress the signal while it is recovered thanks to SOC depending on the
relative angle of the magnetic field.

variation of the relative ratio of the constituent layers as well as the

interfacial ferromagnetism can be modulated by a factor of three depending on
LNO and CMO layer thicknesses as well as their relative ratio. Such an effect
is only possible due to the non-equilibrium crystal symmetries at the

angles and lengths with increasing LNO layer thickness. These results
demonstrate the potential of engineering non-equilibrium crystal symmetries in

of interfacial ferromagnetism in LaNiO$_3$/CaMnO$_3$ superlattices as a
function of LaNiO$_3$ layer thickness. In insulating superlattices (4 unit
cells or less of LaNiO$_3$), magnetism is dominated by Ni-Mn superexchange,
while itinerant electron-based Mn-Mn double-exchange plays a role in thicker
metallic superlattices. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and resonant x-ray
scattering show that Ni-Mn superexchange contributes to the magnetization even
in metallic superlattices. This Ni-Mn superexchange interaction can be
explained in terms of polar compensation at the LaNiO$_3$-CaMnO$_3$ interface.
These results highlight the different mechanisms responsible for interfacial

of first-order logic FO of quantifier rank at most $q$. If a graph property can
be defined in $\textrm{FO}_q$, then it can be decided in time $O(n^q)$. Thus,
minimizing $q$ has favorable algorithmic consequences. Many graph properties
amount to the existence of a certain set of vertices of size $k$. Usually this
can only be expressed by a sentence of quantifier rank at least $k$. We use the
color-coding method to demonstrate that some (hyper)graph problems can be
defined in $\textrm{FO}_q$ where $q$ is independent of $k$. This property of a
graph problem is equivalent to the question of whether the corresponding
parameterized problem is in the class $\textrm{para-AC}^0$.
  It is crucial for our results that the FO-sentences have access to built-in
addition and multiplication. It is known that then FO corresponds to the
circuit complexity class uniform $\textrm{AC}^0$. We explore the connection
between the quantifier rank of FO-sentences and the depth of
$\textrm{AC}^0$-circuits, and prove that $\textrm{FO}_q \subsetneq
\textrm{FO}_{q+1}$ for structures with built-in addition and multiplication.

  Performance of NAND Flash-Based SSDs",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NAND flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs), which are widely used from
embedded systems to enterprise servers, are enhancing performance by exploiting
the parallelism of NAND flash memories. To cope with the performance
improvement of SSDs, storage systems have rapidly adopted the host interface
for SSDs from Serial-ATA, which is used for existing hard disk drives, to
high-speed PCI express. Since NAND flash memory does not allow in-place
updates, it requires special software called Flash Translation Layer (FTL), and
SSDs are equipped with embedded processors to run FTL. Existing SSDs increase
the clock frequency of embedded processors or increase the number of embedded
processors in order to prevent FTL from acting as bottleneck of SSD
performance, but these approaches are not scalable. This paper proposes a
hardware-automated Flash Map Management Unit, called FMMU, that handles the
address translation process dominating the execution time of the FTL by
hardware automation. FMMU provides methods for exploiting the parallelism of
flash memory by processing outstanding requests in a non-blocking manner while
reducing the number of flash operations. The experimental results show that the
FMMU reduces the FTL execution time in the map cache hit case and the miss case
by 44% and 37%, respectively, compared with the existing software-based
approach operating in 4-core. FMMU also prevents FTL from acting as a
performance bottleneck for up to 32-channel, 8-way SSD using PCIe 3.0 x32 host
interface.

of microswimmers along the channel, the strength and direction of which
strongly depends on the swimmer type.

traveling pressure waves over its upper surface. The fluid within the cell is
bounded by two asymmetric elastic sheets which are connected to a rigid surface
via distributed springs and modeled by the linearized plate theory. Modal
analysis yields the frequency response of the configuration as a function of
three parameters: the fluidic Womersley number and two ratios of elastic stress
to viscous pressure for each of the sheets. These ratios, analogous to the
Capillary number, combine the effects of fluid viscosity and the sheets
inertia, bending and tension. The resonance frequencies of the configuration
include the resonance frequency of the upper sheet, and the resonance frequency
of both sheets with a constraint of constant gap. Near the resonance frequency
of the upper sheet, the fluid pressure is identical in amplitude and phase to
the external excitation. For configurations where both sheets are near
resonance, small changes in frequency yield significant modification of the
fluidic pressure. In addition, a new resonance frequency is observed, related
to the interaction between motion of fluid parallel to the elastic sheets and
relative elastic displacements of the sheets. The ratio of the amplitude of the
fluidic pressure to the external pressure is presented vs. frequency for
several characteristic solid and fluid properties, yielding a bandpass filter
behaviour. For configurations with a rigid lower surface the pressure ratio is
unity at the passband, while for two elastic sheets pressure amplification or
reduction occurs near the resonance frequencies. The results presented here may

several advantages beyond deterministic deep neural networks (DNNs): they have
more expressive power allowing multi-modal mappings and regularize better due
to their stochastic nature. However, training large-scale SFNN is notoriously
harder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for
SFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of
DNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called
Simplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNNand approximates
certain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The
main novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three
models, i.e., DNN->Simplified-SFNN->SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient
training procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of
DNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively
transferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and
classification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CASIA, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN
datasets. In particular, we train a stochastic model of 28 layers and 36
million parameters, where training such a large-scale stochastic network is
significantly challenging without using Simplified-SFNN

GMsFEM framework such that the convergence of method is independent of the
contrast and linearly decreases with respect to mesh size if oversampling size
is appropriately chosen. We would like to show a mesh-dependent convergence
with a minimal number of basis functions. Our construction starts with an
auxiliary multiscale space by solving local spectral problems. In auxiliary
multiscale space, we select the basis functions that correspond to small
(contrast-dependent) eigenvalues. These basis functions represent the channels
(high-contrast features that connect the boundaries of the coarse block). Using
the auxiliary space, we propose a constraint energy minimization to construct
multiscale spaces. The minimization is performed in the oversampling domain,
which is larger than the target coarse block. The constraints allow handling
non-decaying components of the local minimizers. If the auxiliary space is
correctly chosen, we show that the convergence rate is independent of the
contrast (because the basis representing the channels are included in the
auxiliary space) and is proportional to the coarse-mesh size (because the
constrains handle non-decaying components of the local minimizers). The
oversampling size weakly depends on the contrast as our analysis shows. The
convergence theorem requires that channels are not aligned with the coarse
edges, which hold in many applications, where the channels are oblique with
respect to the coarse-mesh geometry. The numerical results confirm our
theoretical results. In particular, we show that if the oversampling domain
size is not sufficiently large, the errors are large. To remove the
contrast-dependence of the oversampling size, we propose a modified
construction for basis functions and present numerical results and the
analysis.

variational eigenvalues of the $p$-Laplacian on $B$, and $\lambda_\ominus(p;B)$

block factor in terms of the generators. We have also derived a sufficient
condition on the generators so as to turn a pair of effects aliased in the
initial plan separated in the final plan. The theory developed is illustrated
with plans for experiments with three-level factors in situations where
interactions between three or more factors are absent. We have constructed
plans with blocks of size four and fewer runs than a resolution $V$ plan

inference of Bayesian models. The algorithm parallelises evaluation of the
product-form likelihoods formed when a parameter has many children in the
directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation; and parallelises sampling of
conditionally-independent sets of parameters. A heuristic algorithm is used to
decide which approach to use for each parameter and to apportion computation
across computational cores. This enables MultiBUGS to automatically parallelise
the broad range of statistical models that can be fitted using BUGS-language
software, making the dramatic speed-ups of modern multi-core computing
accessible to applied statisticians, without requiring any experience of
parallel programming. We demonstrate the use of MultiBUGS on simulated data

estimation. A novel contribution of our method is that image gradient is used
to describe image patches and proved to be able to produce robust matching.
Therefore, our method is more efficient than methods that adopt special
features (like SIFT) or patch distance metric. Moreover, we find that image
gradient is scalable for optical flow estimation, which means we can use
different levels of gradient feature (for example, full gradients or only
direction information of gradients) to obtain different complexity without
dramatic changes in accuracy. Another contribution is that we uncover the
secrets of limited PatchMatch through a thorough analysis and design a
pyramidal matching framework based these secrets. Our pyramidal matching
framework is aimed at robust gradient matching and effective to grow inliers
and reject outliers. In this framework, we present some special enhancements
for outlier filtering in gradient matching. By initializing EpicFlow with our
matches, experimental results show that our method is efficient and robust

that some assumptions in their proof can be justified by the use of the
Perron-Frobenius theorem. The minimum-uncertainty states are the ones that
saturate this uncertainty inequality. The continuum limit is closely analyzed
by introducing a scale factor in the limiting scheme. Using the
minimum-uncertainty states, we construct a non-negative quasi probability
distribution. Its marginal distributions are smeared out. However, we show that
this quasi probability is optimal in the sense that there does not exist a
non-negative quasi probability distribution with sharper marginal properties if
the translational covariance in the phase space is assumed. Generally, it is
desirable that the quasi probability is complete, i.e., it contains full
information of the state. We show that the obtained quasi probability is indeed
complete if the dimension of the state space is odd, whereas it is not if the

porous media by applying a generative neural network that allows an implicit
description of the probability distribution represented by three-dimensional

networks, that this method of unsupervised learning is able to generate
representative samples of porous media that honor their statistics. We
successfully compare measures of pore morphology, such as the Euler
characteristic, two-point statistics and directional single-phase permeability
of synthetic realizations with the calculated properties of a bead pack, Berea
sandstone, and Ketton limestone. Results show that GANs can be used to
reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional images of porous media at
different scales that are representative of the morphology of the images used
to train the neural network. The fully convolutional nature of the trained
neural network allows the generation of large samples while maintaining
computational efficiency. Compared to classical stochastic methods of image

$\Delta t \propto \nu^{1/k_r}$, we infer $k_r \sim 1$, employed in the context
of equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energy density for parameter
estimation. From the estimated core position offset ($\Omega_{r \nu}$) and the
core radius ($r_{\rm core}$), we infer that opacity model may not be valid in
all cases. The mean magnetic field strength at 1 pc ($B_1$) and at the core
($B_{\rm core}$), are in agreement with previous estimates. We apply the
magnetically arrested disk model to estimate black hole spins in the range
$0.15-0.9$ for these blazars, indicating that the model is consistent with
expected accretion mode in such sources. The power law shaped power spectral
density has slopes $-$1.3 to $-$2.3 and is interpreted in terms of multiple
shocks or magnetic instabilities.

Boolean control networks (BCNs) are both NP-hard in the number of nodes of
BCNs. In this paper, we use the aggregation method to overcome the challenging
complexity problem in verifying the observability and reconstructibility of
large-scale BCNs with special structures in some sense. First, we define a
special class of aggregations that are compatible with observability and
reconstructibility (i.e, observability and reconstructibility are meaningful
for each part of the aggregation), and show that even for this special class of
aggregations, the whole BCN being observable/reconstructible does not imply the
resulting sub-BCNs being observable/reconstructible, and vice versa. Second,
for acyclic aggregations in this special class, we prove that all resulting
sub-BCNs being observable/reconstructible implies the whole BCN being
observable/reconstructible. Third, we show that finding such acyclic special
aggregations with sufficiently small parts can tremendously reduce
computational complexity. Finally, we use the BCN T-cell receptor kinetics
model to illustrate the efficiency of these results. In addition, the special
aggregation method characterized in this paper can also be used to deal with
the observability/reconstructibility of large-scale linear (special classes of
nonlinear) control systems with special network structures.

First of all, the error bounds have different scaling factors with respect to
the number of antennas in the uplink and downlink. Secondly, uplink
localization is sensitive to the orientation angle of the user equipment (UE),

non-line-of-sight paths generally improve localization when a line-of-sight

of the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are challenging due to
the intense, extended, low- contrast, and dynamic nature of emission from the
quiet Sun, and the extremely intense and variable nature of emissions
associated with energetic phenomena. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter

solar observations are significantly different from observations of sidereal

of observations. We describe the commissioning efforts that enable the use of

continuum interferometric-imaging observations of the Sun with ALMA. Examples
of high-resolution synthesized images obtained using the newly commissioned

that is to D-branes as the Polyakov action is to fundamental strings. This
`standard action' is abstractly a non-Abelian gauged sigma model --- based on
maps $\varphi: (X^{\!A\!z},E;\nabla)\rightarrow Y$ from an Azumaya/matrix
manifold $X^{\!A\!z}$ with a fundamental module $E$ with a connection $\nabla$
to $Y$ --- enhanced by the dilaton term, the gauge-theory term, and the
Chern-Simons/Wess-Zumino term that couples $(\varphi,\nabla)$ to Ramond-Ramond
field. In a special situation, this new theory merges the theory of harmonic
maps and a gauge theory, with a nilpotent type fuzzy extension. With the
analysis developed in D(13.1) (arXiv:1606.08529 [hep-th]) for such maps and an
improved understanding of the hierarchy of various admissible conditions on the
pairs $(\varphi,\nabla)$ beyond D(13.2.1) (arXiv:1611.09439 [hep-th]) and how
they resolve the built-in obstruction to pull-push of covariant tensors under a
map from a noncommutative manifold to a commutative manifold, we develop
further in this note some covariant differential calculus needed and apply them
to work out the first variation --- and hence the corresponding equations of
motion for D-branes --- of the standard action and the second variation of the
kinetic term for maps and the dilaton term in this action. Compared with the
non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action constructed in D(13.1) along the same
line, the current note brings the Nambu-Goto-string-to-Polyakov-string analogue
to D-branes. The current bosonic setting is the first step toward the dynamics
of fermionic D-branes (cf. D(11.2): arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]) and their
quantization as fundamental dynamical objects, in parallel to what happened to
the theory of fundamental strings during years 1976--1981.

describes the possibility of reconstructing the state that characterizes the
system from observing its inputs and outputs. Despite the huge effort made to
study this property, there is no general analytical criterion to automatically
check the state observability when the dynamics are also driven by unknown
inputs. Here, we introduce the general analytical solution of this fundamental
problem, often called the unknown input observability problem. We provide the
systematic procedure, based on automatic computation (differentiation and
matrix rank determination), that allows us to automatically check the state
observability even in the presence of unknown inputs. The fundamental step to
obtain this solution is the introduction of the group of invariance of
observability. We introduce the group of transformations under which
observability is invariant. Based on this group, we introduce new tensor fields
with respect to this group of transformations. The analytical solution of the
unknown input observability problem is expressed in terms of these tensors.
This paper provides this solution together with the main analytical steps for
its derivation and a sketch of the proof of its validity. A complete
derivation, together with additional important properties, is available in
[45]. On the other hand, this paper also provides a more general solution than
the one presented in [45] by exhaustively dealing with the systems that do not
belong to the category of the systems that are canonic with respect to their
unknown inputs. This solution is also provided in the form of a new algorithm.
We illustrate the implementation of the new algorithm by studying the
observability properties of a nonlinear system in the framework of
visual-inertial sensor fusion.

arising from non-Gaussian Van Hove correlation function. Our study shows that
there are at least two possible origins of this non-Gaussian behaviour: the
decoupling of the solute-solvent dynamics and the intermittency in the solute
motion, the latter playing a dominant role. In the former scenario when
averaged over time long enough to explore different solvent environments, the
dynamics recovers the Gaussian nature. In the case of intermittent dynamics the
non-Gaussianity remains even after long averaging and the Gaussian behaviour is
obtained at a much longer time. Our study further shows that only for an
intermediate attractive solute-solvent interaction the dynamics of the solute
is intermittent. The intermittency disappears for weaker or stronger
attractions.

creation, viewing and forwarding/sharing of information over time open new
possibilities to quantitatively and systematically understand the information
diffusion process on social networks. From an online social network like
WeChat, we could collect a large number of information cascade trees, each of
which tells the spreading trajectory of a message/information such as which
user creates the information and which users view or forward the information
shared by which neighbors. In this work, we propose two heterogeneous
non-linear models. Both models are validated by the WeChat data in reproducing
and explaining key features of cascade trees. Specifically, we firstly apply
the Random Recursive Tree (RRT) to model the cascade tree topologies, capturing
key features, i.e. the average path length and degree variance of a cascade
tree in relation to the number of nodes (size) of the tree. The RRT model with
a single parameter $\theta$ describes the growth mechanism of a tree, where a
node in the existing tree has a probability $d_i^{\theta}$ of being connected
to a newly added node that depends on the degree $d_i$ of the existing node.
The identified parameter $\theta$ quantifies the relative depth or broadness of
the cascade trees, indicating that information propagates via a star-like
broadcasting or viral-like hop by hop spreading. The RRT model explains the
appearance of hubs, thus a possibly smaller average path length as the cascade
size increases, as observed in WeChat. We further propose the stochastic
Susceptible View Forward Removed (SVFR) model to depict the dynamic user
behaviors including creating, viewing, forwarding and ignoring a message on a
given social network.

been the two dominant strategies for solving various inverse problems in
low-level vision. Typically, those two kinds of methods have their respective
merits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based optimization methods are flexible for
handling different inverse problems but are usually time-consuming with
sophisticated priors for the purpose of good performance; in the meanwhile,
discriminative learning methods have fast testing speed but their application
range is greatly restricted by the specialized task. Recent works have revealed
that, with the aid of variable splitting techniques, denoiser prior can be
plugged in as a modular part of model-based optimization methods to solve other
inverse problems (e.g., deblurring). Such an integration induces considerable
advantage when the denoiser is obtained via discriminative learning. However,
the study of integration with fast discriminative denoiser prior is still
lacking. To this end, this paper aims to train a set of fast and effective CNN
(convolutional neural network) denoisers and integrate them into model-based
optimization method to solve other inverse problems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned set of denoisers not only achieve promising
Gaussian denoising results but also can be used as prior to deliver good
performance for various low-level vision applications.

exercise is performed for M dwarfs using Kepler-detected planets. Distribution
of planet mass between current orbits produces a disk with total mass of

output of a forward model of planet formation indicates that the effect of
detection bias on disk profile is slight and that the observed scatter in

This nominal M dwarf disk is more centrally concentrated than those inferred
around the solar-type stars observed by Kepler, and the mass surface density

the nucleus, which later prevented cooling and quenched star formation.
ZF-COSMOS-20115 likely remained quiescent at $z<3.7$. We find that the

multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with low-resolution
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), in which K users with a single-antenna
communicate with one base station (BS) with Nr antennas. In this system, we
present a novel multiuser MIMO detection framework that is inspired by coding
theory. The key idea of the proposed framework is to create a code C of length
2Nr over a spatial domain. This code is constructed by a so-called
auto-encoding function that is not designable but is completely described by a
channel transformation followed by a quantization function of the ADCs. From
this point of view, we convert a multiuser MIMO detection problem into an
equivalent channel coding problem, in which a codeword of C corresponding to
users' messages is sent over 2Nr parallel channels, each with different channel
reliability. To the resulting problem, we propose a novel weighted minimum
distance decoding (wMDD) that appropriately exploits the unequal channel
reliabilities. It is shown that the proposed wMDD yields a non-trivial gain
over the conventional minimum distance decoding (MDD). From coding-theoretic
viewpoint, we identify that bit-error-rate (BER) exponentially decreases with
the minimum distance of the code C, which plays a similar role with a condition
number in conventional MIMO systems. Furthermore, we develop the communication
method that uses the wMDD for practical scenarios where the BS has no knowledge
of channel state information. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify
the superiority of the proposed method.

Consequently, as a first step, we investigate the problem of enumerating all

a polynomial delay can be reached for polynomials and otherwise in the

article, we briefly review phase reduction theory, which is a simple and
powerful method for analyzing the synchronization properties of limit-cycle
oscillators exhibiting rhythmic dynamics. Through phase reduction theory, we
can systematically simplify the nonlinear multi-dimensional differential
equations describing a limit-cycle oscillator to a one-dimensional phase
equation, which is much easier to analyze. Classical applications of this
theory, i.e., the phase locking of an oscillator to a periodic external forcing
and the mutual synchronization of interacting oscillators, are explained.
Further, more recent applications of this theory to the synchronization of
non-interacting oscillators induced by common noise and the dynamics of coupled
oscillators on complex networks are discussed. We also comment on some recent
advances in phase reduction theory for noise-driven oscillators and rhythmic
spatiotemporal patterns.

  This paper presents a method for the automatic segmentation of MR brain

ensure that the method obtains accurate segmentation details as well as spatial
consistency, the network uses multiple patch sizes and multiple convolution
kernel sizes to acquire multi-scale information about each voxel. The method is
not dependent on explicit features, but learns to recognise the information
that is important for the classification based on training data. The method
requires a single anatomical MR image only.
  The segmentation method is applied to five different data sets: coronal
T2-weighted images of preterm infants acquired at 30 weeks postmenstrual age
(PMA) and 40 weeks PMA, axial T2- weighted images of preterm infants acquired
at 40 weeks PMA, axial T1-weighted images of ageing adults acquired at an
average age of 70 years, and T1-weighted images of young adults acquired at an

interval, which relies on a Markov assumption, leads to a drastically different

model yields posterior probability distribution functions (pdfs) for these
errors based on expectations of naturalness encoded in Bayesian priors and the
observed order-by-order convergence pattern of the EFT. A first application was
made to chiral EFT for neutron-proton scattering using the semi-local

application to consider a larger set of regulator parameters, energies, and

errors. The Bayesian approach allows for statistical validations of the
assumptions and enables the calculation of posterior pdfs for the EFT breakdown
scale. The statistical model is validated for EKM potentials whose convergence
behavior is not distorted by regulator artifacts. For these cases, the
posterior for the breakdown scale is consistent with EKM assumptions.

processing of large amounts of data. Managed runtimes are now widely used to
support the execution of several storage solutions of the NoSQL movement,
particularly when dealing with big data key-value store-driven applications.
The benefits of these runtimes can however be limited by modern parallel
throughput-oriented GC algorithms, where related objects have the potential to
be dispersed in memory, either in the same or different generations. In the
long run this causes more page faults and degradation of locality on
system-level memory caches.
  We propose, Gang-CG, an extension to modern heap layouts and to a parallel GC
algorithm to promote locality between groups of related objects. This is done
without extensive profiling of the applications and in a way that is
transparent to the programmer, without the need to use specialized data
structures. The heap layout and algorithmic extensions were implemented over
the Parallel Scavenge garbage collector of the HotSpot JVM\@.
  Using microbenchmarks that capture the architecture of several key-value
stores databases, we show negligible overhead in frequent operations such as
the allocation of new objects and improvements to the access speed of data,
supported by lower misses in system-level memory caches. Overall, we show a 6\%
improvement in the average time of read and update operations and an average
decrease of 12.4\% in page faults.

characterize the bulge chemistry, spatial distribution, kinematics, and to
compare it chemically with the thin and thick disks. The sample consist on
~2500 red clump stars in 11 bulge fields ($-10^\circ\leq l\leq+8^\circ$ and
$-10^\circ\leq b\leq-4^\circ$), and a set of ~6300 disk stars selected for
comparison. The bulge MDF is confirmed to be bimodal across the whole sampled
area, with metal-poor stars dominating at high latitudes. The metal-rich stars
exhibit bar-like kinematics and display a bimodality in their magnitude
distribution, a feature which is tightly associated with the X-shape bulge.
They overlap with the metal-rich end of the thin disk sequence in the [Mg/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] plane. Metal-poor bulge stars have a more isotropic hot kinematics
and do not participate in the X-shape bulge. With similar Mg-enhancement
levels, the position of the metal-poor bulge sequence ""knee"" is observed at
[Fe/H]$_{knee}=-0.37\pm0.09$, being 0.06 dex higher than that of the thick
disk. It suggests a higher SFR for the bulge than for the thick disk. Finally,
we present a chemical evolution model that suitably fits the whole bulge
sequence by assuming a fast ($<1$ Gyr) intense burst of stellar formation at
early epochs. We associate metal-rich stars with the B/P bulge formed from the
secular evolution of the early thin disk. On the other hand, the metal-poor
subpopulation might be the product of an early prompt dissipative collapse
dominated by massive stars. Nevertheless, our results do not allow us to firmly
rule out the possibility that these stars come from the secular evolution of
the early thick disk. This is the first time that an analysis of the bulge MDF
and $\alpha$-abundances has been performed in a large area on the basis of a
homogeneous, fully spectroscopic analysis of high-resolution, high S/N data.

partial differential equations with grid based methods has recently been
implemented in the (Py)OP2 library. Inspired by this approach, we develop a
Python code generation system for molecular dynamics simulations on different

its performance and scalability on different hardware and compare it to other
state-of-the-art simulation packages. With growing data volumes the extraction

combination of apsidal and nodal differences between the two orbits $ b_1
\Delta \varpi + b_2 \Delta \Omega $, forming a collection of secular resonances
in which the ones studied in Paper I are among the strongest. Test of the model
in the orbital vicinity of massive satellites with physical and orbital
parameters similar to those of the irregular satellites Himalia at Jupiter and
Phoebe at Saturn shows that $> 20\%$ and $> 40\%$ of phase space is affected by
these resonances, respectively. The survivability of the resonances is
confirmed using numerical integration of the full Newtonian equations of
motion. We observe that the lowest order resonances with $b_1+|b_2|\le 3$
persist, while even higher order resonances, up to $b_1+|b_2|\ge 7$, survive.
Depending on the mass, between $10\%-60\%$ of the integrated test particles are

earliest epochs of solar system history. At that time, the Sun was almost
certainly a member of the stellar cluster, where it was born. Since the solar
birth cluster is likely to have been massive (1000--10 000 Msol), and therefore
long-lived, an issue concerns the survival of such a primordial Oort Cloud. We
have investigated this issue by simulating the orbital evolution of Oort Cloud
comets for several hundred Myr, assuming the Sun to start its life as a typical
member of such a massive cluster. We have devised a synthetic representation of
the relevant dynamics, where the cluster potential is represented by a King
model, and about 20 close encounters with individual cluster stars are selected
and integrated based on the solar orbit and the cluster structure. Thousands of
individual simulations are made, each including 3 000 comets with orbits with
three different initial semi-major axes. Practically the entire initial Oort
Cloud is found to be lost for our choice of semi-major axes (5 000--20 000 au),
independent of the cluster mass, although the chance of survival is better for
the smaller cluster, since in a certain fraction of the simulations the Sun
orbits at relatively safe distances from the dense cluster centre. For the
range of birth cluster sizes that we investigate, a primordial Oort Cloud will
likely survive only as a small inner core with semi-major axes < 3 000 au. Such
a population of comets would be inert to orbital diffusion into an outer halo
and subsequent injection into observable orbits. Some mechanism is therefore
needed to accomplish this transfer, in case the Oort Cloud is primordial and
the birth cluster did not have a low mass. From this point of view, our results
lend some support to a delayed formation of the Oort Cloud, that occurred after
the Sun had left its birth cluster.

detuning between the laser and the exciton transition in the dot. In
particular, the maximal efficiency of the cavity feeding is obtained for
detunings corresponding to transition energies between cavity-dressed states
with excitation numbers larger than one. Phonons significantly enhance the
cavity feeding at large detunings. In the strong-driving, strong-coupling
limit, the photon statistics is highly non-Poissonian. While without phonons a
double-peaked structure in the photon distribution is predicted, phonons make
the photon statistics thermal-like with very high effective temperatures $\sim

obtained by numerical calculations where the driving, the dot-cavity coupling

classified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While
the latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the
former is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation,
since their predictions often disagree with experiments by orders of magnitude.
A theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group
theory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom. Here we
show first that classical nucleation and growth theories alone cannot explain
the FOPTs of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by linearly
varying an externally applied field. Then we offer compelling evidence that the
transitions agree well with the renormalization-group theory when logarithmic
corrections are properly considered. This unifies the theories for both classes

the pancreas-derived peptide amylin, accompanies obesity and precedes type II
diabetes. Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas,
brain, and heart, where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation.
In the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form
modestly cation-selective, voltage-dependent ion channels that embed in the
cell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a
dose-dependent manner, which is correlated with elevated cytosolic calcium
(Ca2+). Our core hypothesis therefore is that non-selective inward Ca2+
conduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular
Ca2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of
amylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is
sufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load, and if so, how might amplified Ca2+
transients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these
questions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling
to reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and
decreased Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function
stemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this
model, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was
sufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes. Our model indicated that
amplified cytosolic transients are driven by increased Ca2+ loading of the
sarcoplasmic reticulum and may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent activation of
calmodulin. These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced
by deposition of amylin oligomers contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in
pre-diabetes.

nevertheless leads to a qualitative change of dynamics. For instance, such a
dynamic transition can be between the convergence to a stationary state and a
strong increase without stationary states, or between the convergence to one
stationary state and that to a different state. This effect is illustrated for
a dynamical system describing two symbiotic populations, one of which exhibits
a growth rate larger than the other one. We show that, although the stationary
states of the dynamical system do not depend on the growth rates, the latter
influence the boundary of the basins of attraction. This change of the basins

homogeneous models has led to its application to the classical Schwarszchild
black hole interior, which takes the form of a homogeneous Kantowski-Sachs
model. The first steps of this were done in pure quantum mechanical terms,
hinting at the traversable character of the would-be classical singularity, and
then others were performed using effective heuristic models capturing quantum
effects that allowed a geometrical description closer to the classical one but
avoided its singularity. However, the problem of establishing the link between
the quantum and effective descriptions was left open. In this work, we propose
to fill in this gap by considering the path-integral approach to the loop
quantization of the Kantowski-Sachs model corresponding to the Schwarzschild
black hole interior. We show that the transition amplitude can be expressed as
a path integration over the imaginary exponential of an effective action which
just coincides, under some simplifying assumptions, with the heuristic one.
Additionally, we further explore the consequences of the effective dynamics. We
prove first that such dynamics imply some rather simple bounds for phase-space
variables, and in turn, remarkably, in an analytical way, they imply that
various phase-space functions that were singular in the classical model are now
well behaved. In particular, the expansion rate, its time derivative, and the
shear become bounded, and hence the Raychaudhuri equation is finite term by
term, thus resolving the singularities of classical geodesic congruences.
Moreover, all effective scalar polynomial invariants turn out to be bounded.

Ising pairing in transition metal dichalcogenide layers. In LaAlO3/SrTiO3
heterostructures, a gate tunable superconducting electron gas is confined in a
quantum well at the interface between two insulating oxides. Remarkably, the
gas coexists with both magnetism and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling and is a
candidate system for the creation of Majorana fermions. However, both the

that the superconducting phase diagram of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is controlled by the

microwave experiments, we measure the superfluid stiffness and infer the gap
energy as a function of carrier density. Whereas a good agreement with the

find that the suppression of Tc at low doping is controlled by the loss of
macroscopic phase coherence instead of electron pairing as in standard BCS

there is a stability region (SR) in the T-P thermodynamic plane outside which
the biomolecule is denaturated. It is known that the extension and shape of the
SR depend on i) the specific protein residue-residue interactions in the native
state of the amino acids sequence and ii) the water properties at the hydration
interface. Here we analyze by Monte Carlo simulations of different
coarse-grained protein models in explicit water how changes in i) and ii)
affect the SR. We show that the solvent properties ii) are essential to
rationalize the SR shape at low T and high P and that our finding are robust
with respect to parameter changes and with respect to different protein models.
These results can help in developing new strategies for the design of novel
synthetic biopolymers.

significantly improve upon previous $nnz(A)$ time algorithms based on oblivious

constant $G$ is extraordinarily small. This has led to ask whether it could
have decayed to its present value from an initial one commensurate with
microscopical units. A mechanism that leads to such a decay is proposed herein.
It is based on assuming that $G$ may take different values within regions of
the universe separated by a novel kind of domain wall, a ""G-wall"". The idea is
implemented by introducing a gauge potential $A_{\mu\nu\rho}$, and its
conjugate $D$, which determines the value of $G$ as an integration constant
rather than a fundamental constant. The value of $G$ jumps when one goes
through a $G$-wall. The procedure extends one previously developed for the
cosmological constant, but the generalization is far from straightforward: (i)
The intrinsic geometry of a $G$-wall is not the same as seen from its two
sides, because the second law of black hole thermodynamics mandates that the
jump in $G$ must cause a discontinuity in the scale of length. (ii) The size of
the decay step in $G$ is controlled by a function $G(D)$ which may be chosen so
as to diminish the value of $G$ towards the asymptote $G=0$, without fine
tuning. It is shown that: (i) The dynamics of the gravitational field with $G$
treated as a dynamical variable, coupled to $G$-walls and matter, follows from
an action principle, which is given. (ii) A particle that impinges on a
$G$-wall may be refracted or reflected. (iii) The various forces between two
particles change when a $G$-wall is inserted in between them. (iv) $G$-walls
may be nucleated trough tunneling and thermal effects. The semiclassical
probabilities are evaluated. (v)~If the action principle is constructed
properly, the entropy of a black hole increases when the value of the
gravitational constant is changed through the absorption of a G-wall by the
hole.

metric between two image sets. Images in each set belong to the same identity.
Since images in a set can be complementary, they hopefully lead to higher
accuracy in practical applications. However, the quality of each sample cannot
be guaranteed, and samples with poor quality will hurt the metric. In this
paper, the quality aware network (QAN) is proposed to confront this problem,
where the quality of each sample can be automatically learned although such
information is not explicitly provided in the training stage. The network has
two branches, where the first branch extracts appearance feature embedding for
each sample and the other branch predicts quality score for each sample.
Features and quality scores of all samples in a set are then aggregated to
generate the final feature embedding. We show that the two branches can be
trained in an end-to-end manner given only the set-level identity annotation.
Analysis on gradient spread of this mechanism indicates that the quality
learned by the network is beneficial to set-to-set recognition and simplifies
the distribution that the network needs to fit. Experiments on both face
verification and person re-identification show advantages of the proposed QAN.

to the directionality of the dark matter signal. This study was performed under
the assumption that, above 50 keV of recoil energy, one can determine (with
some resolution) the direction of the recoil nucleus without head-tail
discrimination, as suggested by past studies that proposed to exploit the
dependence of columnar recombination on the angle between the recoil nucleus
direction and the electric field. In this paper we study the differential
interaction recoil rate as a function of the recoil direction angle with
respect to the zenith for a detector located at the Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso and we determine its diurnal and seasonal modulation. Using a
likelihood-ratio based approach we show that, with the angular information
alone, 100 events are enough to reject the isotropic hypothesis at three
standard deviation level. For an exposure of 100 tonne years this would
correspond to a spin independent WIMP-nucleon cross section of about 10^-46
cm^2 at 200 GeV WIMP mass. The results presented in this paper provide strong
motivation for the experimental determination of directional recoil effects in
two-phase liquid argon detectors.

getting converted into a high mortality rate. Cancer, at the early stages, is
hard to detect because the malicious cells show similar properties (density) as
shown by the non-malicious cells. The mortality ratio could have been minimized
if the breast cancer could have been detected in its early stages. But the
current systems have not been able to achieve a fully automatic system which is
not just capable of detecting the breast cancer but also can detect the stage
of it. Estimation of malignancy grading is important in diagnosing the degree
of growth of malicious cells as well as in selecting a proper therapy for the
patient. Therefore, a complete and efficient clinical decision support system
is proposed which is capable of achieving breast cancer malignancy grading
scheme very efficiently. The system is based on Image processing and machine
learning domains. Classification Imbalance problem, a machine learning problem,
occurs when instances of one class is much higher than the instances of the
other class resulting in an inefficient classification of samples and hence a
bad decision support system. Therefore EUSBoost, ensemble based classifier is
proposed which is efficient and is able to outperform other classifiers as it
takes the benefits of both-boosting algorithm with Random Undersampling
techniques. Also comparison of EUSBoost with other techniques is shown in the
paper.

monochromators, analyzers and filters at neutron and X-ray scattering
facilities. In this Letter we report the first observation of an anomalous
neutron Halo scattering of HOPG. The scattering projects a ring onto the
detector with half cone angle of 12.4 degree that surprisingly persists to
incident neutron wavelengths far beyond the Bragg cutoff for graphite (6.71 A).
At longer wavelengths the ring is clearly a doublet with a splitting roughly
proportional to wavelength. While the ring centers at the beam position if the
beam is normal to the basal planes of HOPG, sample tilting results in the shift
of the ring towards the same direction. The angle of ring shift is observed to
be less than the sample tilts, which is wavelength dependent with longer
wavelengths providing larger shifts. Additionally, upon tilting, the ring
broadens and splits into a doublet at the low angle side with short wavelength
neutrons whereas only subtle broadening is observed at longer wavelengths. The
ring broadens and weakens with decreasing HOPG quality. We also notice that the
intensity at the ring positions scales with the sample thickness. The ring
vanishes as the sample is cooled down to 30 K, suggesting that the lattice
dynamics of graphite is one of the factors that cause the scattering ring. A
possible interpretation by combining inelastic scattering and Yoneda scattering
is proposed.

dots as computational devices. Typically, these operate ideally by maintaining
arrays in their ground state to ensure correct computational output. For large
QCA circuits, thermal fluctuations make this impossible, so adiabatic clocking
has been proposed as a means of dividing large circuit computations into
subcircuit computations that are more reliable. In this report, it is shown
that wires and inverters can transmit information correctly via their excited
states just as well as their ground states. A characteristic example of a 4
cell wire is simulated, and a theoretical derivation of this result is given.
When, non-nearest neighbor interactions are included in the Hamiltonian, this
result still holds true. On the other hand, QCA majority gates and more complex
circuits give incorrect results when operated in excited states. These results
suggest that gates of reliable QCA circuits should be contained in smaller
clocking zones, while wires relaying information can be contained in larger
clocking zones.
