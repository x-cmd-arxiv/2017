correlations measured for arbitrary local observables. In such states the
genuine entanglement is noticeable solely in correlations between subsets of
particles. A straightforward way to obtain such states for odd $N$ is to design
an `anti-state' in which all correlations between an odd number of observers
are exactly opposite. Evenly mixing a state with its anti-state then produces a
mixed state with no $N$-partite correlations, with many of them genuinely
multiparty entangled. Intriguingly, all known examples of `entanglement without
correlations' involve an \emph{odd} number of particles. Here we further
develop the idea of anti-states, thereby shedding light on the different
properties of even and odd particle systems. We conjecture that there is no
anti-state to any pure even-$N$-party entangled state making the simple
construction scheme unfeasable. However, as we prove by construction,
higher-rank examples of `entanglement without correlations' for arbitrary even
$N$ indeed exist. These classes of states exhibit genuine entanglement and even
violate an $N$-partite Bell inequality, clearly demonstrating the non-classical
features of these states as well as showing their applicability for quantum
communication complexity tasks.

and widely used ones to describe the complex many-electron effects of
two-dimensional quantum systems. Beyond local density approximation, the
generalized gradient approximations(GGAs) are designed using reduced density
gradient as main ingredient. An enhancement factor is constructed using the
inhomogeneity parameter of GGAs by taking care of the low and high density
behaviors of it. Thus, the exchange energy functional proposed by making use of
the aforementioned enhancement factor, significantly reduces the error compare
to the previously proposed gradient approximations. Another enhancement factor
and corresponding energy functional is also constructed using the inhomogeneity
parameter originally introduced by Becke [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 2092 (1998)].
Comprehensive testing and performance of both the functionals are demonstrated
with respect to the exact exchange formalism by considering two-dimensional
parabolically confined quantum dots with varying particle number and
confinement strength as a test case.

sufficiently long lived to form ""top-partnerium"" bound states that decay

confidence in code quality. Testing floating-point code usually requires
painstaking efforts in handling floating-point constraints, e.g., in symbolic
execution. This paper turns the challenge of testing floating-point code into
the opportunity of applying unconstrained programming --- the mathematical
solution for calculating function minimum points over the entire search space.
Our core insight is to derive a representing function from the floating-point
program, any of whose minimum points is a test input guaranteed to exercise a
new branch of the tested program. This guarantee allows us to achieve high
coverage of the floating-point program by repeatedly minimizing the
representing function.
  We have realized this approach in a tool called CoverMe and conducted an
extensive evaluation of it on Sun's C math library. Our evaluation results show
that CoverMe achieves, on average, 90.8% branch coverage in 6.9 seconds,
drastically outperforming our compared tools: (1) Random testing, (2) AFL, a
highly optimized, robust fuzzer released by Google, and (3) Austin, a

analysis models with existing deep neural network algorithms and compare the
models with psychological measurements to enlighten the relationship. In the
experiments, we first examined psychological state of 64 participants and asked
them to summarize the story of a book, Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Marquez,
1981). Secondly, we trained models using crawled 365,802 movie review data;
then we evaluated participants' summaries using the pretrained model as a
concept of transfer learning. With the background that emotion affects on
memories, we investigated the relationship between the evaluation score of the
summaries from computational models and the examined psychological
measurements. The result shows that although CNN performed the best among other
deep neural network algorithms (LSTM, GRU), its results are not related to the
psychological state. Rather, GRU shows more explainable results depending on
the psychological state. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as
follows: (1) we enlighten the relationship between computational models and
psychological measurements. (2) we suggest this framework as objective methods
to evaluate the emotion; the real sentiment analysis of a person.

described based on the diffusion Langevin equation with a short-range source
caused by (a) random amplitude or (b) gradient of magnetization. For a TL
modeled as a two-port network with open and shorted ends, the effective
magnetic flux at the open end has non-local dependency on noise distribution
along the TL. The flux-flux correlation function is evaluated and analyzed for
the regimes (Aa), (Ab). (Ba), and (Bb). Essential frequency dispersion takes
place around the inverse diffusion time of random flux along the TL. Typically,
noise effect increases with size faster than the area of TL. The flux-flux
correlator can be verified both via the population relaxation rate of the
qubit, which is formed by the Josephson junction shunted by the TL with flux
noises, and via random voltage at the open end of the TL.

presents numerous challenges such as high-dimensionality data, heterogeneity,
and high complexity of some algorithms. For instance, some algorithms may have
linear complexity but they require the domain knowledge in order to determine
their input parameters. Distributed clustering techniques constitute a very
good alternative to the big data challenges (e.g.,Volume, Variety, Veracity,
and Velocity). Usually these techniques consist of two phases. The first phase
generates local models or patterns and the second one tends to aggregate the
local results to obtain global models. While the first phase can be executed in
parallel on each site and, therefore, efficient, the aggregation phase is
complex, time consuming and may produce incorrect and ambiguous global clusters
and therefore incorrect models. In this paper we propose a new distributed
clustering approach to deal efficiently with both phases, generation of local
results and generation of global models by aggregation. For the first phase,
our approach is capable of analysing the datasets located in each site using
different clustering techniques. The aggregation phase is designed in such a
way that the final clusters are compact and accurate while the overall process
is efficient in time and memory allocation. For the evaluation, we use two
well-known clustering algorithms, K-Means and DBSCAN. One of the key outputs of
this distributed clustering technique is that the number of global clusters is
dynamic, no need to be fixed in advance. Experimental results show that the
approach is scalable and produces high quality results.

with polarization as large as 580 pC/m. Further studies show that the
polarization in the BiN monolayer can be easily switched from [100] to [010]
direction over the bridging saddle phase by applying a tensile [010] stress of
2.54 N/m or compressive [100] stress of -1.18 N/m. This phase transition makes
its lattice constants vary in a large range compared to other non-ferroelectric
2D materials. Moreover, through applying uniaxial tensile stress parallel to
the polarization, one can fix the polarization and change the semiconductor
energy gap from direct to indirect one. The optical properties feature a very

reorientation, rendering stripes \emph{parallel} to $B_\parallel$. In contrast,
the mechanism which reorients stripes perpendicular to $B_\parallel$ showed no
noticeable dependence on density. Measurements at $\nu = 9/2$ and $11/2$ at the
same, tilted magnetic field, allows us to rule out density dependence of the
native symmetry-breaking field as a dominant factor. Our findings further
suggest that screening might play an important role in determining stripe
orientation, providing guidance in developing theories aimed at identifying and
describing native and $B_\parallel$-induced symmetry-breaking fields.

that interact strongly with light, combined with its highly nonlinear optical
response, has generated great expectations for application of the
atomically-thin material to nanophotonic devices. These expectations are mainly
reinforced by classical analyses performed using the response derived from
extended graphene, neglecting finite-size and nonlocal effects that become
important when the carbon layer is structured on the nanometer scale in actual
device designs. Here we show that finite-size effects produce large
contributions that increase the nonlinear response of nanostructured graphene
to significantly higher levels than those predicted by classical theories. We
base our analysis on a quantum-mechanical description of graphene using
tight-binding electronic states combined with the random-phase approximation.
While classical and quantum descriptions agree well for the linear response
when either the plasmon energy is below the Fermi energy or the size of the
structure exceeds a few tens of nanometers, this is not always the case for the
nonlinear response, and in particular, third-order Kerr-type nonlinearities are
generally underestimated by the classical theory. Our results reveal the
complex quantum nature of the optical response in nanostructured graphene,

the measured negative signal is about 30-60% of the peak positive signal, the
effect strongly reduces the CCE even in non-irradiated detectors. For further
investigation of the phenomenon the measurements have been reproduced by TCAD
simulations.
  As for the measurements, the simulation study was applied for the p-on-n
strip detectors similar in geometry to those developed for the ATLAS experiment
and for the Ioffe Institute designed p-on-n strip detectors with each strip
having a window in the metallization covering the p$^+$ implant, allowing the
generation of electron-hole pairs under the strip implant. Red laser scans
across the strips and the interstrip gap with varying laser diameters and
Si-SiO$_2$ interface charge densities were carried out. The results verify the
experimentally observed negative response along the scan in the interstrip gap.
When the laser spot is positioned on the strip p$^+$ implant the negative
response vanishes and the collected charge at the active strip proportionally
increases.
  The simulation results offer a further insight and understanding of the

electroweak sector of the Standard Model at high energies. Higgsplosion, the
first mechanism, occurs at some critical energy in the 25 to 10^3 TeV range,
and leads to an exponentially growing decay rate of highly energetic particles
into multiple Higgs bosons. We argue that this a well-controlled
non-perturbative phenomenon in the Higgs-sector which involves the final state
Higgs multiplicities n in the regime n \lambda >> 1 where \lambda is the Higgs
self-coupling. If this mechanism is realised in nature, the cross-sections for
producing ultra-high multiplicities of Higgs bosons are likely to become
observable and even dominant in this energy range. At the same time, however,
the apparent exponential growth of these cross-sections at even higher energies
will be tamed and automatically cut-off by a related Higgspersion mechanism. As
a result, and in contrast to previous studies, multi-Higgs production does not
violate perturbative unitarity. Building on this approach, we then argue that
the effects of Higgsplosion alter quantum corrections from very heavy states to
the Higgs boson mass. Above a certain energy, which is much smaller than their
masses, these states would rapidly decay into multiple Higgs bosons. The heavy
states become unrealised as they decay much faster than they are formed. The
loop integrals contributing to the Higgs mass will be cut off not by the masses
of the heavy states, but by the characteristic loop momenta where their decay
widths become comparable to their masses. Hence, the cut-off scale would be
many orders of magnitude lower than the heavy mass scales themselves, thus
suppressing their quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass.

correctly predicts survival for 1,228 (26.0 percents more patients out of 4,723

Previous work considered the CIP effects on the CMB power-spectrum but
neglected to include the CIP effects on estimates of the lensing potential
power spectrum (though its contribution to the non-Gaussian, connected, part of
the CMB trispectrum). Here, the CIP contribution to the standard estimator for

filling, the system forms a `composite Fermi liquid(CFL)' with emergent Fermi
surface and exhibits metallic behavior, based on the standard Halperin, Lee,
and Read(HLR) field theory. Recently, Son introduces a composite Dirac theory
as the low energy effective description of Half-filled Landau Level. Such
theory exhibits particle-hole symmetry and the underlying composite Fermi
surface displays a robust $\pi$ Berry phase. In this paper, we start from the
bilayer Half-filled Landau Level system where the two composite Fermi surface
acquires interlayer coherence and forms bonding/anti-bonding composite fermi
sea. The corresponding interlayer coherent composite Fermi liquid(ICCFL) phase
provides a straightforward landscape to verify the Dirac nature in Son's theory
and extract the hidden Berry phase structure of the composite Fermi surface.
The ICCFL phase contains two Fermi surfaces which are detached in most regions
but adhesive at two hot spots. Such nematic structure is a consequence of the
Berry phase encoded in the Dirac Fermi surface which is absent in HLR theory.
Due to the nematicity in ICCFL, the system supports half-quantum vortex with
deconfined $\frac{\pi}{2}$ gauge flux and the phase transition toward ICCFL
contains a Lifshitz criticality with $z=3$ dynamical exponent. In addition, the
exciton order parameter carries topological spin number so the ICCFL contains a
unique Wen-Zee term which connects EM response with the background geometry
curvature.

formation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to
compute models with atomic diffusion--with and without radiative
acceleration--and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists
of both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based
on these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial,
bulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the
analysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions
on evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances.
We show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface
metallicity in isochrone age analysis the resulting stellar ages can be
systematically over-estimated by up to 20%. The change of surface abundances
with evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, the concept that
dispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional
chemical signatures. Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary
phases, will show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration
of stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also
initial abundances for individual stars. In the meantime, analyzing the
chemical properties of stars in similar evolutionary phases is essential to
minimize the effects of atomic diffusion in the context of chemical tagging.

self-enrichment scenario for second generation star formation in globular
clusters wherein wind material from first generation massive stars rapidly
radiatively cools. Radiative energy loss allows retention of fast winds within
the central regions of clusters, where it fuels star formation. Secondary star
formation occurs in $\sim3-5$ Myr, before supernovae, producing uniform iron
abundances in both populations. We derive the critical criteria for radiative
cooling of massive star winds and the second generation mass as a function of
cluster mass, radius, and metallicity. We derive a critical condition on $M/R$,
above which second generation star formation can occur. We speculate that above
this threshold the strong decrease in the cluster wind energy and momentum
allows ambient gas to remain from the cluster formation process. We reproduce
large observed second generation fractions of $\sim30-80\%$ if wind material
mixes with ambient gas. Importantly, the mass of ambient gas required is only
of order the first generation's stellar mass. Second generation helium
enrichment $\Delta Y$ is inversely proportional to mass fraction in the second
generation; a large second generation can form with $\Delta Y\sim0.001-0.02$,
while a small second generation can reach $\Delta Y\sim0.16$. Like other
self-enrichment models for the second generation, we are not able to
simultaneously account for both the full range of the Na-O anticorrelation and
the second generation fraction.

the computer vision field. These tasks include image-sentence matching, i.e.,
given an image query, retrieving relevant sentences and vice versa, and
region-phrase matching or visual grounding, i.e., matching a phrase to relevant
regions. This paper investigates two-branch neural networks for learning the
similarity between these two data modalities. We propose two network structures
that produce different output representations. The first one, referred to as an
embedding network, learns an explicit shared latent embedding space with a
maximum-margin ranking loss and novel neighborhood constraints. Compared to
standard triplet sampling, we perform improved neighborhood sampling that takes
neighborhood information into consideration while constructing mini-batches.
The second network structure, referred to as a similarity network, fuses the
two branches via element-wise product and is trained with regression loss to
directly predict a similarity score. Extensive experiments show that our
networks achieve high accuracies for phrase localization on the Flickr30K
Entities dataset and for bi-directional image-sentence retrieval on Flickr30K
and MSCOCO datasets.

also known as the model likelihood or Bayesian evidence, from Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), or other sampled posterior distributions. In order to do
this, one needs to be able to estimate the density of points in parameter
space, and this can be challenging in high numbers of dimensions. Here we
present a Bayesian analysis, where we obtain the posterior for the marginal
likelihood, using $k$th nearest-neighbour distances in parameter space, using
the Mahalanobis distance metric, under the assumption that the points in the
chain (thinned if required) are independent. We generalise the algorithm to
apply to importance-sampled chains, where each point is assigned a weight. We
illustrate this with an idealised posterior of known form with an analytic
marginal likelihood, and show that for chains of length $\sim 10^5$ points, the
technique is effective for parameter spaces with up to $\sim 20$ dimensions. We
also argue that $k=1$ is the optimal choice, and discuss failure modes for the
algorithm. In a companion paper (Heavens et al. 2017) we apply the technique to
the main MCMC chains from the 2015 Planck analysis of cosmic background
radiation data, to infer that quantitatively the simplest 6-parameter flat
$\Lambda$CDM standard model of cosmology is preferred over all extensions
considered.

data point toward a field-induced quantum critical point (QCP) at $H_c$; this
is supported by universal scaling behavior near $H_c$. Remarkably, the data
also reveal the existence of a small characteristic energy scale well below
$1$~meV above which the excitation spectrum changes qualitatively. We relate

separation $R$ much larger than the typical size of the systems are at the core
of a broad sweep of contemporary problems in settings ranging from atomic,
molecular and condensed matter physics to strong interactions and gravity. We
reexamine the dispersive van der Waals interactions between two hydrogen atoms.
The novelty of the analysis resides in the usage of nonrelativistic EFTs of
QED. In this framework, the van der Waals potential acquires the meaning of a
matching coefficient in an EFT suited to describe the low energy dynamics of an
atom pair. It may be computed systematically as a series in $R$ times some
typical atomic scale and in the fine structure constant $\alpha$. The van der
Waals potential gets short range contributions and radiative corrections, which
we compute in dimensional regularization and renormalize here for the first
time. Results are given in $d$ spacetime dimensions. One can distinguish among
different regimes depending on the relative size between $1/R$ and the typical
atomic bound state energy $m\alpha^2$. Each regime is characterized by a
specific hierarchy of scales and a corresponding tower of EFTs. The short
distance regime is characterized by $1/R \gg m\alpha^2$ and the LO van der
Waals potential is the London potential. We compute also NNNLO corrections. In
the long distance regime we have $1/R\ll m\alpha^2$. In this regime, the van
der Waals potential contains contact terms, which are parametrically larger
than the Casimir-Polder potential that describes the potential at large
distances. In the EFT the Casimir-Polder potential counts as a NNNLO effect. In
the intermediate distance regime, $1/R\sim m\alpha^2$, a significantly more
complex potential is obtained which we compare with the two previous limiting
cases. We conclude commenting on the hadronic van der Waals case.

defined as the region within $0.1 \ R_{25}$, and the disk, defined as the
region between $0.1$ and $0.7 \ R_{25}$. We find that 14 galaxies show a
shorter $\tau_{\rm dep}$ ($\sim 1$ Gyr) in the center relative to that in the
disk ($\tau_{\rm dep} \sim 2.4$ Gyrs), which means the central region in those
galaxies is more efficient at forming stars per unit molecular gas mass. This
finding implies that the centers with shorter $\tau_{\rm dep}$ resemble the
intermediate regime between galactic disks and starburst galaxies. Furthermore,
the central drop in $\tau_{\rm dep}$ is correlated with a central increase in
the stellar surface density, suggesting that a shorter $\tau_{\rm dep}$ is
associated with molecular gas compression by the stellar gravitational

linear inverse problems in imaging, deep (convolutional) neural networks have
recently taken the lead in many challenging benchmarks. A remaining drawback of
deep learning approaches is their requirement for an expensive retraining
whenever the specific problem, the noise level, noise type, or desired measure
of fidelity changes. On the contrary, variational methods have a plug-and-play
nature as they usually consist of separate data fidelity and regularization
terms.
  In this paper we study the possibility of replacing the proximal operator of
the regularization used in many convex energy minimization algorithms by a
denoising neural network. The latter therefore serves as an implicit natural
image prior, while the data term can still be chosen independently. Using a
fixed denoising neural network in exemplary problems of image deconvolution
with different blur kernels and image demosaicking, we obtain state-of-the-art
reconstruction results. These indicate the high generalizability of our
approach and a reduction of the need for problem-specific training.
Additionally, we discuss novel results on the analysis of possible optimization
algorithms to incorporate the network into, as well as the choices of algorithm
parameters and their relation to the noise level the neural network is trained
on.

galaxies are recently found to be strongly affected by the rotation of their
host galaxies. The highly eccentric orbits that form when the host is
counterrotating emit strong bursts of gravitational waves that propel rapid
SMBH binary coalescence. Most prior work, however, focused on planar orbits and
a uniform rotation profile, an unlikely interaction configuration. However, the
coupling between rotation and SMBH binary evolution appears to be such a strong
dynamical process that it warrants further investigation. This study uses
direct N-body simulations to isolate the effect of galaxy rotation in more
realistic interactions. In particular, we systematically vary the SMBH orbital
plane with respect to the galaxy rotation axis, the radial extent of the
rotating component, and the initial eccentricity of the SMBH binary orbit. We
find that the initial orbital plane orientation and eccentricity alone can
change the inspiral time by an order of magnitude. Because SMBH binary inspiral
and merger is such a loud gravitational wave source, these studies are critical
for the future gravitational wave detector, LISA, an ESA/NASA mission currently

$\overline{f\,g}\approx \overline f\,\overline g\,$, within Backus (1962)
averaging. This approximation is a crucial step in the method proposed by
Backus (1962), which is widely used in studying wave propagation in layered
Hookean solids. According to this approximation, the average of the product of
a rapidly varying function and a slowly varying function is approximately equal
to the product of the averages of those two functions.
  Considering that the rapidly varying function represents the mechanical
properties of layers, we express it as a step function. The slowly varying
function is continuous, since it represents the components of the stress or
strain tensors. In this paper, beyond the upper bound of the error for that
approximation, which is formulated by Bos et al. (2017), we provide a
statistical analysis of the approximation by allowing the function values to be
sampled from general distributions.
  Even though, according to the upper bound, Backus (1962) averaging might not
appear as a viable approach, we show that$-$for cases representative of
physical scenarios modelled by such an averaging$-$the approximation is
typically quite good. We identify the cases for which there can be a
deterioration in its efficacy.
  In particular, we examine a special case for which the approximation results
in spurious values. However, such a case$-$though physically realizable$-$is
not likely to appear in seismology, where Backus (1962) averaging is commonly
used. Yet, such values might occur in material sciences, in general, for which
Backus (1962) averaging is also considered.

congestion (measured in terms of the number of pairs of hops using the same

compromise between entropy, interference and congestion for a common welfare,
instead of an optimization of the individual trajectories.
  In the limit of high spatial density of users, we describe the totality of
all the message trajectories in terms of empirical measures. Employing large
deviations arguments, we derive a characteristic variational formula for the
limiting free energy and analyse the minimizer(s) of the formula, which
describe the most likely shapes of the trajectory flow. The empirical measures

While decoupled from the scalar-type perturbations in linear order, the tensor
perturbations can be sourced from the scalar-type in the nonlinear order. The
tensor perturbations generated by the quadratic combination of linear
scalar-type cosmological perturbation are widely studied in the literature, but
all previous studies are based on zero-shear gauge without proper
justification. Here, we show that, being second order in perturbation, such an
induced tensor perturbation is generically gauge dependent. In particular, the
gravitational wave power spectrum depends on the hypersurface (temporal gauge)
condition taken for the linear scalar perturbation. We further show that,
during the matter-dominated era, the induced tensor modes dominate over the
linearly evolved primordial gravitational waves amplitude for
$k\gtrsim10^{-2}~[h/{\rm Mpc}]$ even for the gauge that gives lowest induced
tensor modes with the optimistic choice of primordial gravitational waves
($r=0.1$). The induced tensor modes, therefore, must be modeled correctly
specific to the observational strategy for the measurement of primordial
gravitational waves from large-scale structure via, for example, parity-odd

establishment of an exact quantum analogue of the classical transition state
theory (TST), the development of a quantum TST (QTST) with a proper dynamical
justification, while recovering the TST in the classical limit, has been a long
standing theoretical challenge in chemical physics. One of the most recent
efforts of this kind was put forth by Hele and Althorpe (HA) [ J. Chem. Phys.
138 , 084108 (2013)], which can be specified for any cyclically invariant
dividing surface defined in the space of the imaginary time path integral. The
present work revisits the issue of the non-uniqueness of QTST and provides a
detailed theoretical analysis of HA-QTST for a general class of such path
integral dividing surfaces. While we confirm that HA-QTST reproduces the result
based on the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate theory for dividing
surfaces containing only a quadratic form of low frequency Fourier modes, we
find that it produces different results for those containing higher frequency
imaginary time paths which accommodate greater quantum fluctuations. This
result confirms the assessment made in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 144,
084110 (2016)] that HA-QTST does not provide a derivation of RPMD-TST in
general, and points to a new ambiguity of HA-QTST with respect to its
justification for general cyclically invariant dividing surfaces defined in the
space of imaginary time path integrals. Our analysis also offers new insights
into similar path integral based QTST approaches.

games offer a powerful window onto social phenomena such as the establishment,
breakdown and repair of trust. This offers the prospect of particular insight
into populations of subjects suffering from socially-debilitating conditions

foundation for the quantitative analysis of such games exists, namely the
Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP),
computational considerations have hitherto limited its application. Here, we
improve inference in I-POMDPs in a canonical trust game, and thereby highlight
and address two previously unmodelled phenomena: a form of social risk-aversion
exhibited by the player who is in control of the interaction in the game, and
irritation or anger exhibited by both players. Irritation arises when partners
apparently defect, and it causes a precipitate breakdown in cooperation.
Failing to model one's partner's propensity for it leads to substantial
economic inefficiency. We illustrate these behaviours using evidence drawn from
the play of large cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients.

(WR) star with peculiar properties. WN3/O3 spectra exhibit both WR-like
emission and O3 V-like absorption - but at lower luminosity than O3 V or WN
stars. We examine the projected spatial distribution of WN3/O3 stars in the LMC
as compared to O-type stars. Surprisingly, WN3/O3 stars are among the most
isolated of all classes of massive stars; they have a distribution similar to
red supergiants dominated by initial masses of 10-15 $M_{\odot}$, and are far
more dispersed than classical WR stars or luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their
lack of association with clusters of O-type stars suggests strongly that WN3/O3
stars are not the descendants of single massive stars (30 $M_{\odot}$ or
above). Instead, they are likely products of interacting binaries at lower
initial mass (10-18 $M_{\odot}$). Comparison with binary models suggests a
probable origin with primaries in this mass range that were stripped of their H
envelopes through non-conservative mass transfer by a low-mass secondary. We
show that model spectra and positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for
binary stripped stars are consistent with WN3/O3 stars. Monitoring radial
velocities with high-resolution spectra can test for low-mass companions or
runaway velocities. With lower initial mass and environments that avoid very
massive stars, the WN3/O3 stars fit expectations for progenitors of Type Ib and
possibly Type Ibn supernovae.

presence of a cohort of nodes with a large number of links (rich nodes) that
tend to be well connected between each other, creating a tight group (club).
Rich-clubness defines the extent to which a network displays a topological
organization characterized by the presence of a node rich-club. It is crucial
for the investigation of internal organization and function of networks arising
in systems of disparate fields such as transportation, social, communication
and neuroscience. Different methods have been proposed for assessing the
rich-clubness and various null-models have been adopted for performing
statistical tests. However, a procedure that assigns a unique value of
rich-clubness significance to a given network is still missing. Our solution to
this problem grows on the basis of three new pillars. We introduce: i) a
null-model characterized by a lower rich-club coefficient; ii) a fair strategy
to normalize the level of rich-clubness of a network in respect to the
null-model; iii) a statistical test that, exploiting the maximum deviation of
the normalized rich-club coefficient attributes a unique p-value of
rich-clubness to a given network. In conclusion, this study proposes the first
attempt to quantify, using a unique measure, whether a network presents a
significant rich-club topological organization. The general impact of our study
on engineering and science is that simulations investigating how the functional
performance of a network is changing in relation to rich-clubness might be more
easily tuned controlling one unique value: the proposed rich-clubness measure.

""coarse-grained"" solutions of the compressible Euler equations, with standard
conservation laws broken by turbulent anomalies. The anomalous dissipation of
kinetic energy is shown to be due not only to local cascade, but also to a
distinct mechanism called pressure-work defect. Irreversible heating in
stationary, planar shocks with an ideal-gas equation of state exemplifies the
second mechanism. Entropy conservation anomalies are also found to occur by two
mechanisms: an anomalous input of negative entropy (negentropy) by
pressure-work and a cascade of negentropy to small scales. We derive
""4/5th-law""-type expressions for the anomalies, which allow us to characterize
the singularities (structure-function scaling exponents) required to sustain
the cascades. We compare our approach with alternative theories and empirical

increasing the number of parameters of the network, and thus improves location

difference-of-convex (dc) optimization to diverse problems in engineering and
statistics, this paper establishes the dc property of many well-known functions
not previously known to be of this class. Motivated by a quadratic programming
based recourse function in two-stage stochastic programming, we show that the
(optimal) value function of a copositive (thus not necessarily convex)
quadratic program is dc on the domain of finiteness of the program when the
matrix in the objective function's quadratic term and the constraint matrix are
fixed. The proof of this result is based on a dc decomposition of a piecewise
LC1 function (i.e., functions with Lipschitz gradients). Armed with these new
results and known properties of dc functions existed in the literature, we show
that many composite statistical functions in risk analysis, including the
value-at-risk (VaR), conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), expectation-based,
VaR-based, and CVaR-based random deviation functions are all dc. Adding the
known class of dc surrogate sparsity functions that are employed as
approximations of the l_0 function in statistical learning, our work
significantly expands the family of dc functions and positions them for
fruitful applications.

and their goal is to partition the items into $S, \bar{S}$ in a way that
maximizes the welfare, $v_1(S) + v_2(\bar{S})$. We study both the allocation
problem, which asks for a welfare-maximizing partition and the decision
problem, which asks whether or not there exists a partition guaranteeing
certain welfare, for binary XOS valuations. For interactive protocols with
$poly(m)$ communication, a tight 3/4-approximation is known for both
[Fei06,DS06].
  For interactive protocols, the allocation problem is provably harder than the
decision problem: any solution to the allocation problem implies a solution to
the decision problem with one additional round and $\log m$ additional bits of
communication via a trivial reduction. Surprisingly, the allocation problem is
provably easier for simultaneous protocols. Specifically, we show:
  1) There exists a simultaneous, randomized protocol with polynomial
communication that selects a partition whose expected welfare is at least $3/4$
of the optimum. This matches the guarantee of the best interactive, randomized
protocol with polynomial communication.
  2) For all $\varepsilon > 0$, any simultaneous, randomized protocol that
decides whether the welfare of the optimal partition is $\geq 1$ or $\leq 3/4 -
1/108+\varepsilon$ correctly with probability $> 1/2 + 1/ poly(m)$ requires
exponential communication. This provides a separation between the attainable
approximation guarantees via interactive ($3/4$) versus simultaneous ($\leq
3/4-1/108$) protocols with polynomial communication.
  In other words, this trivial reduction from decision to allocation problems
provably requires the extra round of communication.

problem in biomedical research. Despite many publications of machine learning
methods applied to discover new disease genes, it still remains a challenge
because of the pleiotropy of genes, the limited number of confirmed disease
genes among whole genome and the genetic heterogeneity of diseases. Recent
approaches have applied the concept of 'guilty by association' to investigate
the association between a disease phenotype and its causative genes, which
means that candidate genes with similar characteristics as known disease genes
are more likely to be associated with diseases. However, due to the imbalance
issues (few genes are experimentally confirmed as disease related genes within
human genome) in disease gene identification, semi-supervised approaches, like
label propagation approaches and positive-unlabeled learning, are used to
identify candidate disease genes via making use of unknown genes for training -
typically in the scenario of a small amount of confirmed disease genes (labeled
data) with a large amount of unknown genome (unlabeled data). The performance
of Disease gene prediction models are limited by potential bias of single
learning models and incompleteness and noise of single biological data sources,
therefore ensemble learning models are applied via combining multiple diverse
biological sources and learning models to obtain better predictive performance.
In this thesis, we propose three computational models for identifying candidate
disease genes.

framework, and shown to derive from the same probabilistic result, called here
the Fundamental Theorem of Perfect Simulation (FTPS). An exact simulation
algorithm has output according to an input distribution $\pi$. Perfect
simulations are a subclass of exact simulations where recursion is used either
explicitly or implicitly. The FTPS gives two simple criteria that, when
satisfied, give a correct perfect simulation algorithm. First the algorithm
must terminate in finite time with probability 1. Second, the algorithm must be
locally correct in the sense that the algorithm can be proved correct given the
assumption that any recursive call used returns an output from the correct
distribution. This simple idea is surprisingly powerful. Like other general
techniques such as Metropolis-Hastings for approximate simulation, the FTPS
allows for the flexible construction of existing and new perfect simulation
protocols. This theorem can be used to verify the correctness of many perfect
simulation protocols, including Acceptance Rejection, Coupling From the Past,

specific restaurant (a label query); or which one of two restaurants did she
like more (a comparison query).
  We focus on the class of half spaces, and show that under natural
assumptions, such as large margin or bounded bit-description of the input
examples, it is possible to reveal all the labels of a sample of size $n$ using
approximately $O(\log n)$ queries. This implies an exponential improvement over
classical active learning, where only label queries are allowed. We complement
these results by showing that if any of these assumptions is removed then, in
the worst case, $\Omega(n)$ queries are required.
  Our results follow from a new general framework of active learning with
additional queries. We identify a combinatorial dimension, called the
\emph{inference dimension}, that captures the query complexity when each
additional query is determined by $O(1)$ examples (such as comparison queries,
each of which is determined by the two compared examples). Our results for half
spaces follow by bounding the inference dimension in the cases discussed above.

reflecting a complex interplay between spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of

this complexity, by entangling a real-space anisotropy in the spin fluctuation
spectrum with ferro-orbital order and an orthorhombic lattice distortion [5-7].
A more subtle and much less explored facet of the interplay between these
degrees of freedom arises from the sizable spin-orbit coupling present in these
systems, which translates anisotropies in real space into anisotropies in spin
space. Here, we present a new technique enabling nuclear magnetic resonance
under precise tunable strain control, which reveals that upon application of a
tetragonal symmetry-breaking strain field, the magnetic fluctuation spectrum in
the paramagnetic phase of BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ also acquires an anisotropic
response in spin-space. Our results unveil a hitherto uncharted internal spin
structure of the nematic order parameter, indicating that similar to liquid

have shown that this region is forming stars at a rate per unit mass of dense
gas which is at least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc, potentially
violating theoretical predictions. We show that all observational star
formation rate diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar objects and
integrated light measurements - are in agreement within a factor two, hence the
low star formation rate is not the result of the systematic uncertainties that
affect any one method. As these methods trace the star formation over different
timescales, from $0.1 - 5$ Myr, we conclude that the star formation rate has
been constant to within a factor of a few within this time period. We
investigate the progression of star formation within gravitationally bound
clouds on $\sim$ parsec scales and find $1 - 4$ per cent of the cloud masses
are converted into stars per free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the

Non-equilibrium cloud-free models reproduce well the near-infrared spectra and

  feedback from stakeholders",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Legacy encryption systems depend on sharing a key (public or private) among
the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted message. However, this approach
poses privacy concerns. Especially with popular cloud services, the control
over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not
shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not
necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers,
and cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end
the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a
special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any
third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance.
Although this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over
30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
scheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data,
was introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major
achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs
to be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. First, we
present the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially
Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which
are important pillars of achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have
become the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes are presented. Furthermore,
the implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also
surveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is
intended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and
practitioners interested in knowing, applying, as well as extending the state
of the art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.

performance improvement. Prior theory indicates that such differing rates
should influence the relative speed of diffusion of the products embodying the
different technologies since improvement in performance during the diffusion
process increases the desirability of the product diffusing. However, there has
not been a broad empirical attempt to examine this effect and to clarify the
underlying cause. Therefore, this paper reviews the theoretical basis and
focuses upon empirical tests of this effect across multiple products and their
underlying technologies. The results for 18 different diffusing products show
the expected relationship-faster diffusion for products based on more rapidly
improving technological domains- between technological improvement and
diffusion with strong statistical significance. The empirical examination also
demonstrates that technological improvement does not slow down in the latter
parts of diffusion when penetration does slow down. This finding indicates that

far from desired for large-scale spaceborne antenna arrays. Considering the
strictly limited resources on satellites, to improve hardware efficiency of
large-scale spaceborne antenna arrays, in this work inspired by the idea of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) we design a series of non-orthogonal
signature codes for different antenna elements by Cyclically Shifting an
m-Sequence (CSmS) with different offsets named as CSmS-NOMA signaling. This
design can strike an elegant balance between the performance and complexity and
is very suitable for large-scale spaceborne antenna arrays. It is shown that no

CSmS-NOMA signaling needs only one calibrating waveform generator and one

unified theoretical framework is developed based on which the relationship
between calibration accuracy and signal to noise ratio (SNR) has been clearly
revealed. Furthermore, a hardware experiment platform is also built to assess
the theoretical work. For all the considered scenarios, it can be concluded

MIMO still faces several practical challenges. In particular, implementing
massive MIMO in the digital domain requires hundreds of RF chains matching the
number of antennas. Furthermore, designing these components to operate at the
mmWave frequencies is challenging and costly. These motivated the recent
development of hybrid-beamforming where MIMO processing is divided for separate
implementation in the analog and digital domains, called the analog and digital
beamforming, respectively. Analog beamforming using a phase array introduces
uni-modulus constraints on the beamforming coefficients, rendering the
conventional MIMO techniques unsuitable and call for new designs. In this
paper, we present a systematic design framework for hybrid beamforming for
multi-cell multiuser massive MIMO systems over mmWave channels characterized by
sparse propagation paths. The framework relies on the decomposition of analog
beamforming vectors and path observation vectors into Kronecker products of
factors being uni-modulus vectors. Exploiting properties of Kronecker mixed
products, different factors of the analog beamformer are designed for either
nulling interference paths or coherently combining data paths. Furthermore, a
channel estimation scheme is designed for enabling the proposed hybrid
beamforming. The scheme estimates the AoA of data and interference paths by
analog beam scanning and data-path gains by analog beam steering. The
performance of the channel estimation scheme is analyzed. In particular, the
AoA spectrum resulting from beam scanning, which displays the magnitude
distribution of paths over the AoA range, is derived in closed-form. It is
shown that the inter-cell interference level diminishes inversely with the
array size, the square root of pilot sequence length and the spatial separation
between paths.

the existing techniques to seek graph modes by shifting vertices based on

sifting edges in hypergraphs. As a result, the generated graph modes based on
dense subhypergraphs may more accurately capture the object semantics besides

phase boundaries in the system, which originate from the step-like decrease in
carrier effective mass at x ~ 0.3, and from a local minimum in carrier
relaxation time at x ~ 0.5. The origins of these phase boundaries are
considered to be related to isovalent/heterovalent B-site substitution:
parabolic Ti 3d orbitals dominate electron conduction for compositions with x <

distortion of the lattice, in which the B-site is composed of Ti4+ and Nb4+

paradigm for temporal data. To do so, we draw inspiration from classic theory
on linear dynamic systems for modeling time series. By extending such models to
include nonlinear mappings, we derive a series of novel recurrent neural
networks that sequentially make top-down predictions about the future and then
correct those predictions with bottom-up observations. Predictive-corrective
networks have a number of desirable properties: (1) they can adaptively focus
computation on ""surprising"" frames where predictions require large corrections,
(2) they simplify learning in that only ""residual-like"" corrective terms need
to be learned over time and (3) they naturally decorrelate an input data stream
in a hierarchical fashion, producing a more reliable signal for learning at
each layer of a network. We provide an extensive analysis of our lightweight
and interpretable framework, and demonstrate that our model is competitive with
the two-stream network on three challenging datasets without the need for
computationally expensive optical flow.

distilling a human made rule based sentiment engine into a recurrent neural

substantial gain in generalization performance. Our experiments demonstrate the
power of multi-source transfer techniques in practical text analytics problems

  Backhaul Networks","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.GT cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing the operation and
performance of a large-scale, multi-hop millimeter wave (mmW) backhaul within a
wireless small cell network (SCN) that encompasses multiple mobile network
operators (MNOs). The proposed framework enables the small base stations (SBSs)
to jointly decide on forming the multi-hop, mmW links over backhaul
infrastructure that belongs to multiple, independent MNOs, while properly
allocating resources across those links. In this regard, the problem is
addressed using a novel framework based on matching theory that is composed to
two, highly inter-related stages: a multi-hop network formation stage and a
resource management stage. One unique feature of this framework is that it
jointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors
during both network formation and resource management. The multi-hop network
formation stage is formulated as a one-to-many matching game which is solved
using a novel algorithm, that builds on the so-called deferred acceptance
algorithm and is shown to yield a stable and Pareto optimal multi-hop mmW
backhaul network. Then, a one-to-many matching game is formulated to enable
proper resource allocation across the formed multi-hop network. This game is
then shown to exhibit peer effects and, as such, a novel algorithm is developed
to find a stable and optimal resource management solution that can properly
cope with these peer effects. Simulation results show that the proposed
framework yields substantial gains, in terms of the average sum rate, reaching
up to 27% and 54%, respectively, compared to a non-cooperative scheme in which
inter-operator sharing is not allowed and a random allocation approach. The
results also show that our framework provides insights on how to manage pricing
and the cost of the cooperative mmW backhaul network for the MNOs.

Although people never produce exactly the same speech even if we try to express
the same linguistic and para-linguistic information, typical statistical speech
synthesis produces completely the same speech, i.e., there is no
inter-utterance variation in synthetic speech. To give synthetic speech natural
inter-utterance variation, this paper builds DNN acoustic models that make it
possible to randomly sample speech parameters. The DNNs are trained so that
they make the moments of generated speech parameters close to those of natural
speech parameters. Since the variation of speech parameters is compressed into
a low-dimensional simple prior noise vector, our algorithm has lower
computation cost than direct sampling of speech parameters. As the first step
towards generating synthetic speech that has natural inter-utterance variation,
this paper investigates whether or not the proposed sampling-based generation
deteriorates synthetic speech quality. In evaluation, we compare speech quality
of conventional maximum likelihood-based generation and proposed sampling-based
generation. The result demonstrates the proposed generation causes no
degradation in speech quality.

Internet access services; however, to recoup infrastructure costs and increase
revenues, some APs have recently adopted two-sided pricing schemes under which
both end-users and content providers are charged. Meanwhile, with the rapid
growth of traffic, network congestion could seriously degrade user experiences
and influence providers' utility. To optimize profit and social welfare, APs
and regulators need to design appropriate pricing strategies and regulatory
policies that take the effects of network congestion into consideration. In
this paper, we model two-sided networks under which users' traffic demands are
influenced by exogenous pricing and endogenous congestion parameters and derive
the system congestion under an equilibrium. We characterize the structures and
sensitivities of profit- and welfare-optimal two-sided pricing schemes and
reveal that 1) the elasticity of system throughput plays a crucial role in
determining the structures of optimal pricing, 2) the changes of optimal
pricing under varying AP's capacity and users' congestion sensitivity are
largely driven by the type of data traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3) APs and
regulators will be incentivized to shift from one-sided to two-sided pricing
when APs' capacities and user demand for video traffic grow. Our results can
help APs design optimal two-sided pricing and guide regulators to legislate
desirable policies.

However, due to the presence of the mixed derivative, we cannot discuss
numerical methods without some appropriate reformulation, which is
mathematically challenging itself. Therefore, we first propose a novel
procedure for the reformulation of target PDEs into a standard form of

point, we establish the global well-posedness of the sine-Gordon equation.
After that, we classify and discuss the spatial discretizations based on the

lower activity during the weekends and outside of office hours. Firefox
experiences proportionally more activity on weekends than Firefox OS (Cohen's d

holds even when we limit the analyzes on the hired resources, i.e. considering
only individuals with Mozilla foundation email address, although, the effect
sizes are smaller for weekends (Cohen's d = 0.64) and nights (Cohen's d =

weekend is more technical while work during the week expresses more positive

AMS-02 on the International Space Station. Its data spans an energy range from
below 1 GeV up to 400 GeV and most of the data points contain errors below the

by the scatterings of CR protons and helium off interstellar hydrogen and
helium atoms at rest. The modeling of these interactions, which requires the
relevant production cross sections, induces an uncertainty in the determination
of the antiproton source term that can even exceed the uncertainties in the CR

three point functions in the noncommutative CQM which are shown to be deformed.
The $AdS_2/CFT_1$ duality for the CQM suggests that the corresponding
correlation functions in the holographic duals are modified. In addition, the

tuning the electronic and thermal transport along the 2D kirigami structures
have remained original to investigate. We therefore performed extensive

that creep depends on the local arrangements of pinning centers. Vortices

technically natural, small $U(1)$ gauge coupling, $g\lesssim 10^{-8}$, allows
for a low Hubble scale of inflation, $H_I\lesssim 10^5$ GeV, which is shown to
be consistent with Planck data. This feature is then used to realize a

A*) in the Galactic centre has been monitored in both near-infrared continuum
and line emission. There has been a dispute about the character and the
compactness of the object: interpreting it as either a gas cloud or a
dust-enshrouded star. A recent analysis of polarimetry data in $K_{\rm s}$-band
($2.2\,{\rm \mu m}$) allows us to put further constraints on the geometry of
the DSO. The purpose of this paper is to constrain the nature and the geometry
of the DSO. We compare 3D radiative transfer models of the DSO with the NIR
continuum data including polarimetry. In the analysis, we use basic dust
continuum radiative transfer theory implemented in the 3D Monte Carlo code
Hyperion. Moreover, we implement analytical results of the two-body problem
mechanics and the theory of non-thermal processes. We present a composite model
of the DSO -- a dust-enshrouded star that consists of a stellar source, dusty,
optically thick envelope, bipolar cavities, and a bow shock. This scheme can
match the NIR total as well as polarized properties of the observed spectral
energy distribution (SED). The SED may be also explained in theory by a young
pulsar wind nebula that typically exhibits a large linear polarization degree
due to magnetospheric synchrotron emission. The analysis of NIR polarimetry
data combined with the radiative transfer modelling shows that the DSO is a
peculiar source of compact nature in the S cluster $(r \lesssim 0.04\,{\rm
pc})$. It is most probably a young stellar object embedded in a non-spherical
dusty envelope, whose components include optically thick dusty envelope,
bipolar cavities, and a bow shock. Alternatively, the continuum emission could
be of a non-thermal origin due to the presence of a young neutron star and its
wind nebula.

coexistence of one pair of nodal rings and one pair of triply-degenerate nodal
points (TNPs). The nodal ring here is distinct from the previously studied ones
in that its formation requires four entangled bands, not just two as in
previous cases, hence it is termed as a four-band nodal ring (FNR). Remarkably,
we show that FNR features Dirac-cone-like surface states, in contrast to the
usual drumhead surface states for two-band nodal rings. Due to the presence of
inversion symmetry, the TNP here is also different from those discussed
previously in inversion-asymmetric systems. Especially, when spin-orbit
coupling is included, the TNP here transforms into a novel Dirac point that is
close to the borderline between the type-I and type-II Dirac point categories.
We discuss their respective symmetry protections, and construct effective
models for their characterization. The large linear energy range (> 2 eV) in
these materials should facilitate the experimental detection of the signatures

extended to obtain the response of the detector along radial trajectories in

often interpreted as sources `in transition', from dust-enshrouded starbursts

consider the role of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) radiative feedback,
driven by radiation pressure on dust, in high-luminosity, dust-obscured
sources. We analyse how the radiation pressure-driven dusty shell models, with
different shell mass configurations, may be applied to the different
populations of dusty quasars reported in recent observations. We find that
expanding shells, sweeping up matter from the surrounding environment, may
account for prolonged obscuration in dusty quasars, e.g. for a central
luminosity of $L \sim 10^{47}$erg/s, a typical obscured phase (with extinction
in the range $A_{V} \sim 1-10$ mags) may last a few $\sim 10^6$yr. On the other
hand, fixed-mass shells, coupled with high dust-to-gas ratios, may explain the
extreme outflows recently discovered in red quasars at high redshifts. We
discuss how the interaction between AGN radiative feedback and the ambient
medium at different temporal stages in the evolutionary sequence may contribute
to shape the observational appearance of dusty quasar populations.

soft excess is present at energies lower than the photoelectric cut-off. Both
photo-ionized and collisionally ionized components are required to fit it. This
component is constant over the time-scales probed by our data. The spectrum at
energies higher than 2 keV is variable. We propose that its evolution could be
driven by flux-dependent changes in the geometry of the innermost regions of
the accretion disk. The black hole spin in NGC 5506 is constrained to be
0.93$\pm _{ 0.04 }^{0.04}$ at 90% confidence level for one interesting
parameter.

nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions, which cannot be given by the gradient
of the action, as evident from dimensional analysis. Imposing the condition on
the flow equation that it respects both the supersymmetry and the $O(N)$
symmetry, we show that the flow equation has a specific form, which however
contains an undetermined function of the supersymmetric derivatives $D$ and
$\bar D$. Taking the most simple choice, we propose a flow equation for this
model. As an application of the flow equation, we give the solution of the
equation at the leading order in the large $N$ expansion. The result shows that
the flow of the superfield in the model is dominated by the scalar term, since
the supersymmetry is unbroken in the original model. It is also shown that the
two point function of the superfield is finite at the leading order of the
large $N$ expansion.

important problem since the boom of big data. The main challenge lies in the
exponential label space which involves $2^L$ possible label sets especially
when the label dimension $L$ is huge, e.g., in millions for Wikipedia labels.
This paper is motivated to better explore the label space by originally
establishing an explicit label graph. In the meanwhile, deep learning has been
widely studied and used in various classification problems including
multi-label classification, however it has not been properly introduced to XML,
where the label space can be as large as in millions. In this paper, we propose
a practical deep embedding method for extreme multi-label classification, which
harvests the ideas of non-linear embedding and graph priors-based label space
modeling simultaneously. Extensive experiments on public datasets for XML show
that our method performs competitive against state-of-the-art result.

generalized fluid dynamic framework which ensures a smooth transition between
the fluid dynamic core of the cloud and the ballistic corona. We use expansion
data taken by Joseph et al. and measurements of the equation of state by Ku et

critical temperature is $\eta/n|_{T_c}=0.41\pm 0.11$. We also obtain evidence
that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio has a minimum slightly above
$T_c$ with $\eta/s |_{\it min}=0.50\pm 0.10$.

data analysts. In the Big Data setting, analysts are faced with very large
numbers of observations as well as data that arrive as a stream, both of which
are phenomena that many traditional statistical techniques are unable to
contend with. Unfortunately, many of these traditional techniques are useful
and cannot be discarded. One such technique is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test
for goodness-of-fit (GoF). A Big Data and stream-appropriate KS-type test is
derived via the chunked-and-averaged (CA) estimator paradigm. The new test is
termed the CAKS GoF test. The CAKS test statistic is proved to be
asymptotically normal, allowing for the large sample testing of GoF.
Furthermore, theoretical results demonstrate that the CAKS test is consistent
against both fixed alternatives, where the null and the true data generating
distribution are a fixed distance apart, and alternatives that approach the
null at a slow enough rate. Numerical results demonstrate that the CAKS test is
effective in identifying deviation in the distribution with respect to changes
in mean, variance, and shape. Furthermore, it is found that the CAKS test is
faster than the KS test, for large numbers of observation, and can be applied
to sample sizes of 10^{9} and beyond.

statistics should be invariant under scale transformations of the data, since
the endpoints may be measured on different scales. In the context of
high-dimensional data, Srivastava and Kubokawa (2013) proposed such a test

this test statistic to factorial MANOVA designs, incorporating general
heteroscedastic models. In particular, our only distributional assumption is
the existence of the group-wise covariance matrices, which may even be

derive confidence regions and ellipsoids based on these quantiles. In a
simulation study, we extensively analyze the behavior of these procedures.

massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of
demonstration data and is able to automatically assess the necessary ratio of

DQfD works by combining temporal difference updates with supervised

equation to describe the temporal evolution of ion acoustic (IA) solitons in
the presence of trapped electrons. The validity of this theory is studied here
by verifying solitons main characteristic, i.e., stability against successive
mutual collisions. We have employed a kinetic model as a more comprehensive
theory than the fluid one, and utilized a fully kinetic simulation approach
(both ions and electrons are treated based on the Vlasov equation). In the
simulation approach, these solitons are excited self-consistently by employing
the nonlinear process of IA solitons formation from an initial density
perturbation (IDP). The effect of the size of IDPs on the chain formation is
proved by the simulation code as a benchmark test. It is shown that the IA
solitons, in presence of trapped electrons, can retain their features (both in
spatial and velocity direction) after successive mutual collisions. The
collisions here include encounters of IA solitons with the same trapping
parameter, while differing in size. Kinetic simulation results reveal a
complicated behavior during a collision between IA solitons in contrast to the
fluid theory predictions and simulations. In the range of parameters considered
here two oppositely propagating solitons rotate around their collective center
in the phase space during a collision, independent of their trapping
parameters. Furthermore, they exchange some portions of their trapped
populations.

coefficient of the limiting equation is given by Green-Kubo formula and it can

been demonstrated that these ultrafast spin currents can transport angular
momentum to neighbouring FM layers, being able to change both the magnitude and
orientation of the magnetization in the adjacent layer. In this work, both the
generation and absorption of these optically excited spin currents are
investigated. This is done using non-collinear magnetic bilayers, i.e. two FM
layers separated by a conductive spacer. Spin currents are generated in a Co/Ni
multilayer with out-of-plane (OOP) anisotropy, and absorbed by a Co layer with
an in-plane (IP) anisotropy. This behaviour is confirmed by careful analysis of
the laser-pulse induced magnetization dynamics, whereafter it is demonstrated
that the transverse spin current is absorbed very locally near the injection
interface of the IP layer (90% within the first approx. 2 nm). Moreover, it
will also be shown that this local absorption results in the excitation of THz
standing spin waves within the IP layer. The dispersion measured for these high
frequency spin waves shows a discrepancy with respect to the theoretical
predictions, for which a first explanation involving intermixed interface
regions is proposed. Lastly, the spin current generation is investigated using
different number of repeats for the Co/Ni multilayer, which proves to be of
great relevance for identifying the optical spin current generation mechanism.

factor of such manipulation for perpendicular magnetized films arises from the
multi-domain formation due to dipolar interaction. By performing time resolved
measurements under various field, we demonstrate that the same magnetization

full magnetization reversal take place within 5 ps. The energy efficiency of
the ultra-fast current induced magnetization manipulation is optimized thanks
to the ballistic transport of hot-electrons before reaching the GdFeCo magnetic

of learned discriminative parts, upon which an image representation is built.
Considered as a promising avenue a decade ago, this direction has been
neglected since the advent of deep neural networks. In this context, this paper
brings two contributions: first, it shows that despite the recent success of
end-to-end holistic models, explicit part learning can boosts classification
performance. Second, this work proceeds one step further than recent part-based
models (PBM), focusing on how to learn parts without using any labeled data.
Instead of learning a set of parts per class, as generally done in the PBM
literature, the proposed approach both constructs a partition of a given set of
images into visually similar groups, and subsequently learn a set of
discriminative parts per group in a fully unsupervised fashion. This strategy
opens the door to the use of PBM in new applications for which the notion of
image categories is irrelevant, such as instance-based image retrieval, for
example. We experimentally show that our learned parts can help building
efficient image representations, for classification as well as for indexing
tasks, resulting in performance superior to holistic state-of-the art Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) encoding.

Cepheus A HW2, we measured the three-dimensional velocity field of the CH3OH
maser spots, which are projected within 1000au of the HW2 object, with an
accuracy of the order of 0.1km/s. Methods: We made use of the European VLBI
Network (EVN) to image the 6.7GHz CH3OH maser emission towards Cepheus A HW2
with 4.5 milli-arcsecond resolution (3au). We observed at three epochs spaced
by one year between 2013 and 2015. During the last epoch, on mid-march 2015, we
benefited from the new deployed Sardinia Radio Telescope. Results: We show that
the CH3OH velocity vectors lie on a preferential plane for the gas motion with
only small deviations of 12+/-9 degrees away from the plane. This plane is
oriented at a position angle of 134 degrees east of north, and inclined by 26
degrees with the line-of-sight, closely matching the orientation of the
disk-like structure previously reported by Patel et al.(2005). Knowing the
orientation of the equatorial plane, we can reconstruct a face-on view of the
CH3OH gas kinematics onto the plane. CH3OH maser emission is detected within a
radius of 900au from HW2, and down to a radius of about 300au, the latter
coincident with the extent of the dust emission at 0.9mm. The velocity field is
dominated by an infall component of about 2km/s down to a radius of 300au,
where a rotational component of 4km/s becomes dominant. We discuss the nature
of this velocity field and the implications for the enclosed mass. Conclusions:
These findings bring direct support to the interpretation that the high-density
gas and dust emission, surrounding Cepheus A HW2, trace an accretion disk.

times due to Garbage Collection (GC). This is the case in latency-sensitive
applications such as on-line credit-card fraud detection, graph-based computing
for analysis on social networks, etc. Such pauses compromise latency
requirements of the whole application stack and result from applications'
aggressive buffering/caching of data, exposing an ill-suited GC design, which
assumes that most objects will die young and does not consider that
applications hold large amounts of middle-lived data in memory.
  To avoid such pauses, we propose NG2C, a new GC algorithm that combines
pretenuring with an N-Generational heap. By being able to allocate objects into
different generations, NG2C is able to group objects with similar lifetime
profiles in the same generation. By allocating objects with similar lifetime
profiles close to each other, i.e. in the same generation, we avoid object
promotion (copying between generations) and heap fragmentation (which leads to
heap compactions) both responsible for most of the duration of HotSpot GC pause
times.
  NG2C is implemented for the OpenJDK 8 HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, as an
extension of the Garbage First GC. We evaluate NG2C using Cassandra, Lucene,
and GraphChi with three different GCs: Garbage First (G1), Concurrent Mark
Sweep (CMS), and NG2C. Results show that NG2C decreases the worst observable GC
pause time by up to 94.8% for Cassandra, 85.0% for Lucene and 96.45% for
GraphChi, when compared to current collectors (G1 and CMS). In addition, NG2C

valuable alternative tool to generate and test hypotheses on saccharide

for biological macromolecules, for its ability to accurately represent
molecular forces between saccharides. To this end, we calculated a
thermodynamic solution property, the second virial coefficient of the osmotic
pressure ($B_{22}$). Comparison with light scattering experiments revealed a
non-physical aggregation of a prototypical polysaccharide in MARTINI, pointing
at an imbalance of the non-bonded solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water
interactions. This finding also applies to smaller oligosaccharides which were
all found to aggregate in simulations even at moderate concentrations, well
below their solubility limit. Finally, we explored the influence of the
Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction between saccharide molecules and propose a
simple scaling of the LJ interaction strength that makes MARTINI more reliable

the problem in which only a single target is sought, as well as the problem in
which all targets have unit weights.

the achievable open-circuit voltage or over-potential1-3. Here, using transient
and steady-state optical spectroscopy we study a model system, pentacene/C60,
where pentacene triplet excitons are dissociated to form charge transfer
states, which we show to be degenerate in energy with the triplet excitons. We
directly track these charge transfer states undergoing efficient long-range
separation to free charges within 50 ps, despite a significant Coulomb barrier
that we measure to be 220 meV. We model this endothermic charge separation to
be driven by entropic gain. Our results demonstrate that endothermic charge
separation can proceed rapidly with near unity efficiency, overcoming Coulomb
barriers greater than 200meV via a gain in entropy, thus minimising loss of
open-circuit voltage or over-potential. In the pentacene/C60 system this leads
here to an effective VOC loss of only 400meV with respect to the energy of the
triplet exciton. This suggests that excitonic photoconversion systems have no
fundamental disadvantage compared to systems which generate free changes
directly upon photoexcitation.

surfaces. It combines the approaches we presented in two previous papers --
\zs\cite{zhao03} \& \pz\cite{zhao15}. An actual rough surface is (incompletely)
described by its Power Spectral Density (PSD). For a given PSD, model surfaces
with the same roughness as the actual surface are constructed by preserving the
PSD amplitudes and assigning a random phase to each spectral component. Rays
representing the incident wave are reflected from the model surface and
projected onto a flat plane, which is the first order approximation of the
model surface, as outgoing rays and corrected for phase delays. The projected
outgoing rays are then corrected for wave densities and redistributed onto an
uniform grid where the model surface is constructed. The scattering is then
calculated using the Fourier Transform of the resulting distribution. This
method provides the exact solutions for scattering in all directions, without
small angle approximation. It is generally applicable to any wave scatterings
on random rough surfaces and is not limited to small scattering angles.
Examples are given for the Chandra X-ray Observatory optics. This method is
also useful for the future generation X-ray astronomy missions.

parameter space, and can give stronger bound on $\rho_{tt}$ than the current
bound from flavor experiments. As a side result, we find that if
$\rho_{tt}\cos\gamma < 0$, where $\cos\gamma$ is the exotic Higgs component of
$h$, the $\rho_{tt}$-induced top loop contribution cancels against bosonic loop
contributions, and one may have alignment without decoupling, namely
$\sin(-\gamma) \simeq 1$, but exotic scalar bosons could have masses at several
hundred GeV.

hybrid pulsator in the eclipsing binary KIC~9592855. This binary has a circular
orbit, an orbital period of 1.2 days, and contains two stars of almost
identical masses ($M_1=1.72M_{\odot}, M_2=1.71M_{\odot}$). However, the cooler
secondary star is more evolved ($R_2=1.96R_{\odot}$) while the hotter primary
is still on the zero-age-main-sequence ($R_1=1.53R_{\odot}$). Coeval models
from single star evolution cannot explain the observed masses and radii, and
binary evolution with mass-transfer needs to be invoked. After subtracting the
binary light curve, the Fourier spectrum shows low-order pressure-mode
pulsations, and more dominantly, a cluster of low-frequency gravity modes at
about $2$ day$^{-1}$. These g-modes are nearly equally-spaced in period, and
the period spacing pattern has a negative slope. We identify these g-modes as
prograde dipole modes and find that they stem from the secondary star. The
frequency range of unstable p-modes also agrees with that of the secondary. We
derive the internal rotation rate of the convective core and the asymptotic
period spacing from the observed g-modes. The resulting values suggest that the
core and envelope rotate nearly uniformly, i.e., their rotation rates are both
similar to the orbital frequency of this synchronized binary.

simultaneously violated as this would contradict the usual no-signalling
principle. This property is known as monogamy of Bell inequality violations and
generally Bell monogamy relations refer to trade-offs between simultaneous
violations of multiple inequalities. It turns out that multipartite Bell
inequalities admit weaker forms of monogamies that allow for violations of a
few inequalities at once. Here we systematically study monogamy relations
between correlation Bell inequalities both within quantum theory and under the
sole assumption of no signalling. We first investigate the trade-offs in Bell
violations arising from the uncertainty relation for complementary binary
observables, and exhibit several network configurations in which a tight
trade-off arises in this fashion. We then derive a tight trade-off relation
which cannot be obtained from the uncertainty relation showing that it does not
capture monogamy entirely. The results are extended to Bell inequalities
involving different number of parties and find applications in
device-independent secret sharing and device-independent randomness extraction.
Although two multipartite Bell inequalities may be violated simultaneously, we
show that genuine multi-party non-locality, as evidenced by a generalised
Svetlichny inequality, does exhibit monogamy property. Finally, using the
relations derived we reveal the existence of flat regions in the set of quantum
correlations.

which itself is higher than in the terminal shock. The terminal shock is where

teams, assuming lightweight spaceships to be accelerated via either laser or
solar radiation to a significant fraction of the speed of light (c). We
recently showed that gravitational assists can be combined with the stellar
photon pressure to decelerate an incoming lightsail from Earth and fling it
around a star or bring it to rest. Here, we demonstrate that photogravitational
assists are more effective when the star is used as a bumper (i.e. the sail
passes ""in front of"" the star) rather than as a catapult (i.e. the sail passes
""behind"" or ""around"" the star). This increases the maximum deceleration at
$\alpha$ Cen A and B and reduces the travel time of a nominal graphene-class
sail (mass-to-surface ratio 8.6e-4 gram m$^{-2}$) from 95 to 75 yr. The maximum
possible velocity reduction upon arrival depends on the required deflection
angle from $\alpha$ Cen A to B and therefore on the binary's orbital phase.
Here, we calculate the variation of the minimum travel times from Earth into a
bound orbit around Proxima for the next 300 yr and then extend our calculations
to roughly 22,000 stars within about 300 ly. Although $\alpha$ Cen is the most
nearby star system, we find that Sirius A offers the shortest possible travel
times into a bound orbit: 69 yr assuming 12.5% c can be obtained at departure
from the solar system. Sirius A thus offers the opportunity of flyby
exploration plus deceleration into a bound orbit of the companion white dwarf
after relatively short times of interstellar travel.

We have evaluated C-LWIP performance in various link aggregation strategies
(LASs). A C-LWIP node (i.e., the node having collocated, aggregated LTE eNodeB
and Wi-Fi access point functionalities) is implemented in NS-3 which introduces
a traffic steering layer (i.e., Link Aggregation Layer) for efficient
integration of LTE and Wi-Fi. Using extensive simulations, we verified the
correctness of C-LWIP module in NS-3 and evaluated the aggregation benefits
over standalone LTE and Wi-Fi networks with respect to varying number of users
and traffic types. We found that split bearer performs equivalently to switched
bearer for UDP flows and switched bearer outperforms split bearer in the case
of TCP flows. Also, we have enumerated the potential challenges to be addressed
for unleashing C-LWIP capabilities. Our findings also include WoD-Link
Aggregation Strategy which is shown to improve system throughput by 50% as
compared to Naive-LAS in a densely populated indoor stadium environment.

vulnerability of structures to earthquakes. The probability of failure
associated with a prescribed criterion (e.g. the maximal inter-storey drift of
a building exceeding a certain threshold) is represented as a function of the
intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g. peak ground acceleration or
spectral acceleration). The classical approach relies on assuming a lognormal
shape of the fragility curves; it is thus parametric. In this paper, we
introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves
without employing the above assumption, namely binned Monte Carlo simulation
and kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility
curves for a three-storey steel frame using a large number of synthetic ground
motions. The curves obtained with the non-parametric approaches are compared
with respective curves based on the lognormal assumption. A similar comparison
is presented for a case when a limited number of recorded ground motions is
available. It is found that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the
ground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion and most importantly, on
the employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape.

turbulent fluid flows, nonlinear waves, large scale networks and biological
systems. Here, we propose a variational framework for probing conditions that
trigger intermittent extreme events in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical
systems. We seek the triggers as the probabilistically feasible solutions of an
appropriately constrained optimization problem, where the function to be
maximized is a system observable exhibiting intermittent extreme bursts. The
constraints are imposed to ensure the physical admissibility of the optimal
solutions, i.e., significant probability for their occurrence under the natural
flow of the dynamical system. We apply the method to a body-forced
incompressible Navier--Stokes equation, known as the Kolmogorov flow. We find
that the intermittent bursts of the energy dissipation are independent of the
external forcing and are instead caused by the spontaneous transfer of energy
from large scales to the mean flow via nonlinear triad interactions. The global
maximizer of the corresponding variational problem identifies the responsible
triad, hence providing a precursor for the occurrence of extreme dissipation
events. Specifically, monitoring the energy transfers within this triad, allows
us to develop a data-driven short-term predictor for the intermittent bursts of
energy dissipation. We assess the performance of this predictor through direct
numerical simulations.

the framework of quantum mechanics without any additional postulates. The key
concept of the theory is decoherence, which appears as an inherent
characteristic of quantum mechanics and results from the uncertainty relation.
In contrast to environment-induced decoherence, this decoherence exists prior
to a measurement being made. To clarify our idea, we examine three elemental
experiments: a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm
(EPR-Bohm) experiment, and the double-slit experiment. By considering the first
experiment, we explain how the uncertainty relation between position and
momentum introduces decoherence prior to measurement. Consideration of the
EPR-Bohm experiment leads us to conclude that the correlation of the EPR pair
is not a consequence of what is known as the collapse of the wave function. Our
theory of decoherence can also be applied to experiments with continuous
eigenvalues, such as the double-slit experiment. Consideration of the
double-slit experiment leads us to understand how pure quantum mechanics
describes the fact that quanta behave as interfering particles.

transport properties, wear and dissipation. Defects and incommensurate lattice
constants dramatically change these properties. Recently experimental systems
have become accessible to probe the dynamics of nanofriction. Here, we present
a model system consisting of laser-cooled ions in which nanofriction and
transport processes in self-organized systems with back action can be studied
with atomic resolution. We show that in a system with local defects resulting
in incommensurate layers, there is a transition from sticking to sliding with
Aubry-type signatures. We demonstrate spectroscopic measurements of the soft
vibrational mode driving this transition and a measurement of the order
parameter. We show numerically that both exhibit critical scaling near the
transition point. Our studies demonstrate a simple, well-controlled system in
which friction in self-organized structures can be studied from classical- to
quantum-regimes.

as working fluids. Since adding other chemicals to CO 2 moves the critical
point and generally equilibrium lines, it is expected that lower operating
pressures as well as higher global efficiencies may be reached. A simple stage
pure CO 2 cycle is used as reference, with fixed external conditions. Two
scenarios are considered: water is heated from 10 {\textdegree}C to 65
{\textdegree}C for Domestic Hot Water scenario and from 30 {\textdegree}C to 35
{\textdegree}C for Central Heating scenario. In both cases, water at the
evaporator inlet is set at 7 {\textdegree}C to account for such outdoor
temperature conditions. In order to understand the dynamic behaviour of
thermodynamic cycles with mixtures, it is essential to measure the fluid
circulating composition. To this end, we have developed a non intrusive method.
Online optical flow cells allow the recording of infrared spectra by means of a
Fourier Transform Infra Red spectrometer. A careful calibration is performed by
measuring a statistically significant number of spectra for samples of known
composition. Then, a statistical model is constructed to relate spectra to
compositions. After calibration, compositions are obtained by recording the
spectrum in few seconds, thus allowing for a dynamic analysis. This article
will describe the experimental setup and the composition measurement
techniques. Then a first account of results with pure CO 2 , and with the
addition of propane or R-1234yf will be given.

  Video via SP Theory of Intelligence and Species Inspired PSO",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we address the basic problem of recognizing moving objects in
video images using SP Theory of Intelligence. The concept of SP Theory of
Intelligence which is a framework of artificial intelligence, was first
introduced by Gerard J Wolff, where S stands for Simplicity and P stands for
Power. Using the concept of multiple alignment, we detect and recognize object
of our interest in video frames with multilevel hierarchical parts and
subparts, based on polythetic categories. We track the recognized objects using
the species based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, we extract the
multiple alignment of our object of interest from training images. In order to
recognize accurately and handle occlusion, we use the polythetic concepts on
raw data line to omit the redundant noise via searching for best alignment
representing the features from the extracted alignments. We recognize the
domain of interest from the video scenes in form of wide variety of multiple
alignments to handle scene variability. Unsupervised learning is done in the SP
model following the DONSVIC principle and natural structures are discovered via
information compression and pattern analysis. After successful recognition of
objects, we use species based PSO algorithm as the alignments of our object of
interest is analogues to observation likelihood and fitness ability of species.
Subsequently, we analyze the competition and repulsion among species with
annealed Gaussian based PSO. We have tested our algorithms on David, Walking2,
FaceOcc1, Jogging and Dudek, obtaining very satisfactory and competitive
results.

mechanical effects is presented for the prediction of the response of
unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites that are subjected to electric
field, applied in the fibers' direction. It is assumed that at least one of the
phases of the composite (e.g., the fibers) is electrically conductive, and that
all phases are thermally conductive. The composite is assumed to occupy a
finite, symmetric domain which is discretized into a double array of subcells.
The governing equations, with the interfacial and boundary conditions, are
satisfied in the integral sense. The externally applied field generates
electric current, which induces a magnetic field as well as temperature
increase. The mechanical deformation of the composite results from the combined
effect of the ponderomotive force, which is created by the magnetic field, and
the temperature distribution within the constituents. The purpose of the
present paper is three-fold. (a) To perform quantitative analysis of the model
for the ponderoromotive force in deformable media. (b) To present computational
strong-form treatment of the magneto-mechanical boundary-value problem in a
composite. (c) To suggest a computational apparatus for deriving the response
of a sensor/actuator excited by an applied electric field or electric field
gradient. Application is given, presenting the magnetic, thermal and mechanical
field distributions, as well as the macroscopic (global) response of a
composite, which consists, for simplicity, of two iron fibers embedded in an
epoxy matrix.

complex central Gaussian matrix whose elements have arbitrary variances. With
such arbitrary variance profile, this random matrix model fundamentally departs
from classical Wishart models and presents a significant challenge as the
classical analytical toolbox no longer directly applies. We derive new exact
expressions for the distribution of $\mathbf{W}$ and that of its eigenvalues by
means of an explicit parameterization of the group of unitary matrices. Our
results yield remarkably simple expressions, which are further leveraged to
study the outage data rate of a dual-antenna communication system under
different variance profiles.
