Relying on a multi-layer wave-function expansion, the resulting Multi-Layer

be adapted to efficiently resolve system-specific intra- and inter-species

applying it to the problem of colliding few-atom mixtures of both Bose-Fermi

particular, we present examples where the reflection (transmission) at the
other atomic species is a correlation-dominated effect, i.e.\ it is suppressed

extensively studied some time ago by Gaberdiel, Volpato and the two authors. In
the present work, we lift this result to the level of modules of the extensions
of these Virasoro algebras to N=4 super Virasoro algebras. Moreover, we relate
the super vertex operator algebra and module structure of the Conway Moonshine
Module to the operator product expansion of this special K3 theory by a
procedure we call reflection. This procedure can be applied to certain
superconformal field theories, transforming all fields to holomorphic ones. It
also allows to describe certain superconformal field theories within the
language of super vertex operator algebras. We discuss reflection and its
limitations in general, and we argue that through reflection, the Conway
Moonshine Module inherits from the K3 theory a richer structure than
anticipated so far. The comparison between the Conway Moonshine Module and the
K3 theory is considerably facilitated by exploiting the free fermion
description as well as the lattice vertex operator algebra description of both
theories. We include an explicit construction of cocycles for the relevant
charge lattices, which are half integral. The transition from the K3 theory to
the Conway Moonshine Module via reflection promotes the latter to the role of a
medium that collects the symmetries of K3 theories from distinct points of the
moduli space, thus uncovering a version of symmetry surfing in this context.

that the Cold Spot may have a primordial origin rather than being due to

phase observed by Swift-XRT. The FPA occurs only in one of the seven GRB
subclasses: the binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe). This subclass consists of
long GRBs with a carbon-oxygen core and a neutron star (NS) binary companion as
progenitors. The hypercritical accretion of the supernova (SN) ejecta onto the
NS can lead to the gravitational collapse of the NS into a black hole.
Consequently, one can observe a GRB emission with isotropic energy
$E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$~erg, as well as the associated GeV emission and the FPA
phase. Previous work had shown that gamma-ray spikes in the prompt emission
occur at $\sim 10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm with Lorentz gamma factor
$\Gamma\sim10^{2}$--$10^{3}$. Using a novel data analysis we show that the time
of occurrence, duration, luminosity and total energy of the X-ray flares
correlate with $E_{iso}$. A crucial feature is the observation of thermal
emission in the X-ray flares that we show occurs at radii $\sim10^{12}$~cm with
$\Gamma\lesssim 4$. These model independent observations cannot be explained by
the ""fireball"" model, which postulates synchrotron and inverse Compton
radiation from a single ultra relativistic jetted emission extending from the
prompt to the late afterglow and GeV emission phases. We show that in BdHNe a
collision between the GRB and the SN ejecta occurs at $\simeq10^{10}$~cm
reaching transparency at $\sim10^{12}$~cm with $\Gamma\lesssim4$. The agreement
between the thermal emission observations and these theoretically derived
values validates our model and opens the possibility of testing each BdHN
episode with the corresponding Lorentz gamma factor.

a trial, we extract the transverse-momentum distribution amplitude (TMDA) from

of the virtuality-distribution amplitude. By doing that, we derive an
analytical expression for the nonperturbative QDA with the current-quark mass
correction up to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta m_q)$. Numerically, we confirm that the
obtained TMDA reproduces the experimental data for the photon-pion transition
form factor $F_{\gamma\gamma^*\pi^0}(Q^2)$ at the low-$Q^2$ qualitatively well.
We also observe that the obtained QDA approaches to DA as $p_3$ increases,
showing the symmetric and asymmetric curves with respect to $x$ for the pion
and kaon, respectively, due to the current-quark mass difference $m_{u,d}\ll
m_s$. Assigning $\xi\equiv2x-1$, the moments $\langle\xi^n\rangle_{\pi,K}$ are
computed, using the pion and kaon QDAs, and there appear only a few percent
deviations in the moments for $p_3\gtrsim30\Lambda$ in comparison to the values

in the prediction of unconventional gas production, which was first
investigated systematically by Klinkenberg in 1941 and found to increase with
the reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number).
Although the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the
correction factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen
number increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize
the porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according
to the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction
factor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's
experimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation
in simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time,
two key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the
tortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation
coefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that
Klinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent
and intrinsic permeabilities is $\lesssim30$; at large ratios (or Knudsen
numbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number. Our numerical
results could also serve as benchmarking cases to assess the accuracy of
macroscopic models and/or numerical schemes for the modeling/simulation of
rarefied gas flows in complex geometries over a wide range of gas rarefaction.

immediate vicinity of erupting flares and are associated with coronal mass
ejections. Since their initial discovery in 2005, there have been several
subsequent investigations of SCBs. These studies have used differing detection
and analysis techniques, making it difficult to compare results between

(Solar Phys. 283, 97, 2013) to extract the physical characteristics of SCBs in
11 flares of varying size and intensity. We demonstrate that the magnetic
substructure within the SCB appears to have a significantly smaller area than
the corresponding H-alpha emission. We conclude that SCBs originate in the
lower corona around 0.1 R_sun above the photosphere, propagate away from the
flare center at speeds of 35 - 85 km/s, and have peak photosphere magnetic
intensities of 148 +/- 2.9 G. In light of these measurements, we infer SCBs to
be distinctive chromospheric signatures of erupting coronal mass ejections.

microscale physics and chemistry involved in meteor-trail formation, with
particular emphasis on the first 100 or so milliseconds of the trail formation.
We discuss and examine the combined physico-chemical effects of
meteor-generated and ablationally amplified cylindrical shock waves which
appear in the ambient atmosphere immediately surrounding the meteor train, as
well as the associated hyperthermal chemistry on the boundaries of the high
temperature postadiabatically expanding meteor train. We demonstrate that the
cylindrical shock waves produced by overdense meteors are sufficiently strong
to dissociate molecules in the ambient atmosphere when it is heated to
temperatures in the vicinity of 6,000 K, which substantially alters the
considerations of the chemical processes in and around the meteor train. We
demonstrate that some ambient O2, along with O2 that comes from the shock
dissociation of O3, survives the passage of the cylindrical shock wave, and
these constituents react thermally with meteor metal ions, thereby subsequently
removing electrons from the overdense meteor train boundary through fast,
temperature independent, dissociative recombination governed by the second
Damkohler number. Possible implications for trail diffusion and lifetimes are
discussed.

circular and the net effect accumulates slowly over time. We calculate the
radial profile of scattered stars with an idealized model and find that it
approaches an equilibrium shape that is exponential, similar to the observed
shapes of galaxy discs. Our models treat only scattering and have no bars or
spiral arms, so the results apply mostly to dwarf irregular galaxies where
there are no other obvious scattering processes. Stellar scattering by gaseous
perturbations slows down when the stellar population gets thicker than the gas

moves away from the surface of integration along different directions, one can
map out the shape of the singular manifold in the parameter space.

Standard Model (SM) fermions are supplemented by a single DM fermion $\chi$

U(1)$^\prime$ charges, the SM leptons must also have non-zero U(1)$^\prime$
charges, in which case LHC searches impose strong constraints on the $Z'$ mass.
Moreover, the DM fermion $\chi$ must have a vector-like U(1)$^\prime$ coupling.
If one requires the DM particle to have a purely axial U(1)$^\prime$ coupling,
which would be the case if $\chi$ were a Majorana fermion and would reduce the
impact of direct DM searches, the simplest possibility is that it is
accompanied by one other new singlet fermion, but in this case the
U(1)$^\prime$ charges of the SM leptons still do not vanish. This is also true
in a range of models with multiple new singlet fermions with identical charges.
Searching for a leptophobic model, we then introduce extra fermions that
transform non-trivially under the SM gauge group. We find several such models
if the DM fermion is accompanied by two or more other new fermions with
non-identical charges, which may have interesting experimental signatures. We
present benchmark representatives of the various model classes we discuss.

such rare events motivates the analysis of large deviations in stochastic
models of gene expression. Recent developments in non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics have led to a framework for analyzing Markovian processes conditioned
on rare events and for representing such processes by conditioning-free driven
Markovian processes. We use this framework, in combination with approaches
based on queueing theory, to analyze a general class of stochastic models of
gene expression. Modeling gene expression as a Batch Markovian Arrival Process
(BMAP), we derive exact analytical results quantifying large deviations of
time-integrated random variables such as promoter activity fluctuations. We
find that the conditioning-free driven process can also be represented by a
BMAP that has the same form as the original process, but with renormalized
parameters. The results obtained can be used to quantify the likelihood of
large deviations, to characterize system fluctuations conditional on rare
events and to identify combinations of model parameters that can give rise to
dynamical phase transitions in system dynamics.

theoretical models of innovation adoption, namely: Diffusion of Innovation
theory (DOI), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned

The model depicts IS security innovation adoption in organisations, as two
decision proceedings. The adoption process from the initiation stage until the
acquisition of innovation is considered as a decision made by organisation
while the process of innovation assimilation is assumed as a result of the user
acceptance of innovation within the organisation. In addition, the model
describes the IS Security adoption process progressing in three sequential
stages, i.e. pre-adoption, adoption- decision and post-adoption phases. The
model also introduces several factors that influence the different stages of IS

populations may pose challenges to some models of galaxy formation. However, to
securely classify a galaxy as quiescent, it is necessary to exclude significant
ongoing star formation, something that can be challenging to achieve at high
redshift. In this letter, we analyse deep ALMA/870um and SCUBA-2/450um imaging
of the claimed ""post-starburst"" galaxy ZF-20115 at z=3.717 that exhibits a
strong Balmer break and absorption lines. The far-infrared imaging reveals a
luminous starburst located 0.4+/-0.1 arcsec (~3kpc in projection) from the
position of the rest-frame ultra-violet/optical emission, with an obscured
star-formation rate of 100 Mo/yr. This star-forming component is undetected in
the rest-frame ultraviolet but contributes significantly to the lower angular
resolution photometry at restframe wavelengths >3500A, significantly
complicating the determination of a reliable stellar mass. Importantly, in the
presence of dust obscuration, strong Balmer features are not a unique signature
of a post-starburst galaxy and are indeed frequently observed in
infrared-luminous galaxies. We conclude that the ZF20015 system does not pose a
challenge to current models of galaxy formation and that deep sub-/millimeter
observations are a prerequisite for any claims of quiescence. The
multi-wavelength observations of ZF20115 unveil a complex system with an
intricate and spatially-varying star-formation history. ZF20115 demonstrates
that understanding high-redshift obscured starbursts will only be possible with
multi-wavelength studies that include high-resolution observations, available
with the JWST, at mid-infrared wavelengths.

this emission continues above $\sim$30~TeV, hadronic models of the \emph{Fermi}
bubbles would provide a significant contribution to the high-energy neutrino
flux detected by the IceCube observatory. Even in models where leptonic
$\gamma$-rays produce the \emph{Fermi} bubbles flux at GeV energies, a hadronic
component may be observable at very high energies. The combination of IceCube
and HAWC measurements have the ability to distinguish these scenarios through a
comparison of the neutrino and $\gamma$-ray fluxes at a similar energy scale.
We examine the most recent four-year dataset produced by the IceCube
collaboration and find no evidence for neutrino emission originating from the
\emph{Fermi} bubbles. In particular, we find that previously suggested excesses
are consistent with the diffuse astrophysical background with a p-value of 0.22
(0.05 in an extreme scenario that all the IceCube events that overlap with the
bubbles come from them). Moreover, we show that existing and upcoming HAWC
observations provide independent constraints on any neutrino emission from the

neutrino fluxes in hadronic interactions. The combination of these results
disfavors a significant contribution from the \emph{Fermi} bubbles to the

require many-spin interactions which may be very difficult to realize in a real

realistic model which has the so-called X-cube fracton topological order but
only requires nearest-neighbor two-spin interactions. The model lives on a
three-dimensional honeycomb-based lattice with one to two spin-1/2 degrees of
freedom on each site and a unit cell of 6 sites. The model is constructed from
two orthogonal stacks of $Z_2$ topologically ordered Kitaev honeycomb layers,
which are coupled together by a two-spin interaction. It is also shown that a
four-spin interaction can be included to instead stabilize 3+1D $Z_2$

Galactic disk, using a detailed model for the physics and chemistry of diffuse
interstellar gas clouds to interpret previously-published measurements of the
abundance of four molecular ions: ArH$^+$, OH$^+$, H$_2$O$^+$ and H$_3^+$. For
diffuse $atomic$ clouds at Galactocentric distances in the range $R_g \sim 4 -
9$ kpc, observations of ArH$^+$, OH$^+$, and H$_2$O$^+$ imply a mean primary
CRIR of $(2.2 \pm 0.3) \exp [(R_0-R_g)/4.7\,\rm{kpc}] \times 10^{-16} \rm \,
s^{-1}$ per hydrogen atom, where $R_0=8.5$ kpc. Within diffuse $molecular$
clouds observed toward stars in the solar neighborhood, measurements of H$_3^+$
and H$_2$ imply a primary CRIR of $(2.3 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-16}\,\,\rm s^{-1}$
per H atom, corresponding to a total ionization rate per H$_2$ molecule of
$(5.3 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-16}\,\,\rm s^{-1},$ in good accord with previous
estimates. These estimates are also in good agreement with a rederivation,
presented here, of the CRIR implied by recent observations of carbon and
hydrogen radio recombination lines along the sight-line to Cas A. Here, our
best-fit estimate for the primary CRIR is $2.9 \times 10^{-16}\,\,\rm s^{-1}$
per H atom. Our results show marginal evidence that the CRIR in diffuse
molecular clouds decreases with cloud extinction, $A_{\rm V}({\rm tot})$, with
a best-fit dependence $\propto A_{\rm V}({\rm tot})^{-1}$ for $A_{\rm V}({\rm
tot}) \ge 0.5$.

using classical computational resources. This notion is supported by the fact
that in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for a large number of important
problems it is not known how to express the partition function in a sign-free
manner. The answer to the question --- whether there is an fundamental
obstruction to such a sign-free representation in generic quantum systems ---
remains unclear. Here, focussing on systems with bosonic degrees of freedom, we
show that quantized gravitational responses appear as obstructions to local
sign-free QMC. In condensed matter physics settings these responses, such as
thermal Hall conductance, are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects.
We show that similar arguments hold also in the case of spontaneously broken
time-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a perturbed quantum
Kagome antiferromagnet. The connection between quantized gravitational
responses and the sign problem is also clearly manifested in certain vertex
models, where TR symmetry is preserved.

targeted a distance-limited sample of 98 objects with the Chandra X-ray

us to further investigate the active fraction as a function of galactic
morphology. After correcting for contamination to the nuclear X-ray signal from
bright X-ray binaries, we measure an active fraction $f$=11.2$\%^{+7.4}_{-4.9}$
(1$\sigma$ C.L.) across the whole sample, in agreement with previous estimates
based on an heterogeneous combination of optical, X-ray and radio diagnostics,
by Seth et al. (2008). After accounting for the different stellar mass
distributions in our samples, we find no statistically significant difference
in the active fraction of early- vs. late-type nucleated galaxies, with
$f$=10.6$\%^{+11.9}_{-4.9}$ and 10.8$\%^{+11.3}_{-6.3}$, respectively. For the
early-type nucleated galaxies, we are able to carry out a controlled comparison
with a parent sample of non-nucleated galaxies covering the same stellar mass
range, finding again no statistically significant difference in the active
fraction. Taken at face value, our findings suggest that the presence of a NSC
does not facilitate nor enhance accretion-powered emission from a nuclear
super-massive black hole. This is true even for late-type nucleated galaxies,
home to bluer NSCs and arguably larger gas reservoirs.

that nuisance parameters describing the modeled system's orientation with

gravitational field can be optimized simultaneously with the particle weights.
We develop a method for sampling from the high-dimensional uncertainty
distribution of the particle weights. We combine this in a Gibbs sampler with
samplers for the nuisance and potential parameters to explore the uncertainty
distribution of the full set of parameters. We illustrate our M2M improvements
by modeling the vertical density and kinematics of F-type stars in Gaia DR1.
The novel M2M method proposed here allows full probabilistic modeling of
steady-state dynamical systems, allowing uncertainties on the non-parametric
distribution function and on nuisance parameters to be taken into account when
constraining the dark and baryonic masses of stellar systems.

introduced. The nonlinearity strength is modulated by a set of singular peaks
on top of a self-focusing or defocusing uniform background. The peaks may
include a repulsive or attractive linear potential too. We find that a pair of
mutually symmetric peaks readily gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SSB) of modes pinned to individual peaks, while antisymmetric pinned
modes are always unstable, transforming into robust spatially odd breathers.
Three- and five-peak structures support symmetric modes, with in-phase or
twisted profiles, and do not give rise to asymmetric states. A stability area
is found for the twisted states pinned to the triple peaks, while the
corresponding in-phase modes are unstable, unless the three modulation peaks
are set very close to each other, covered by a single-peak pinned mode. All
patterns pinned to five peaks are unstable too. Collisions of moving solitons
with the singular-modulation peak are studied too. Slowly moving solitons
bounce back from the peak, while the collisions are quasi-elastic for fast
solitons. In the intermediate case, the soliton is destroyed by the collision.
In a special case, the condition of a resonance of the incident soliton with a
trapped mode supported by the peak leads to capture of the soliton.

useful information about the image (even without the answer being available).
For instance, the question ""what is the breed of the dog?"" informs the AI that
the animal in the scene is a dog and that there is only one dog present. We
make three contributions: (1) providing an extensive qualitative and
quantitative analysis of the information contained in human visual questions,
(2) proposing two simple but surprisingly effective modifications to the

understanding the image content and diverse ways of describing it in natural

the performance of this task. Most state-of-the-art approaches follow an
encoder-decoder framework, which generates captions using a sequential

decision-making framework for image captioning. We utilize a ""policy network""

serves as a local guidance by providing the confidence of predicting the next
word according to the current state. Additionally, the value network serves as
a global and lookahead guidance by evaluating all possible extensions of the
current state. In essence, it adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words
towards the goal of generating captions similar to the ground truth captions.
We train both networks using an actor-critic reinforcement learning model, with
a novel reward defined by visual-semantic embedding. Extensive experiments and
analyses on the Microsoft COCO dataset show that the proposed framework
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across different evaluation metrics.

$\left\vert E_{3}(V_{AA}=0)\right\vert >2\left\vert E_{2}\right\vert$. In the
case of a system complicated by isospins(spins), such as the kaonic clusters $

balancing the relative excitation power of two lasers emitting at different

off-resonant QDs, we identify distinct single-QD signatures in the lasing
characteristics and distinguish between gain contributions of a single resonant
emitter and a countable number of off-resonant background emitters to the
optical output of the microlaser. We address the important question whether
single-QD lasing is feasible in experimentally accessible systems and show
that, for the investigated microlaser, the single-QD gain needs to be supported
by the background gain contribution of off-resonant QDs to reach the transition
to lasing. Interestingly, while a single QD cannot drive the investigated
micropillar into lasing, its relative contribution to the emission can be as
high as 70% and it dominates the statistics of emitted photons in the

a mild age dependence is still expected. We use seismically identified red
clump stars in the Kepler field for which we have reliable distances, masses
and ages from the SAGA survey to first explore this effect. By excluding red
clump stars with masses larger than 1.6 Msun (corresponding to ages younger
than 2 Gyr), we derive robust calibrations linking intrinsic colors to absolute
magnitudes in the following photometric systems: Str\""omgren $by$, Johnson
$BV$, Sloan $griz$, 2MASS $JHK_s$ and WISE $W1W2W3$. With the precision
achieved we also detect a slope of absolute magnitudes 0.020(0.003) mag per
Gyrin the infrared, implying that distance calibrations of clump stars can be
off by up to 0.2 mag in the infrared (over the range from 2 Gyr to 12 Gyr) if
their ages are unknown. Even larger uncertainties affect optical bands, because
of the stronger interdependency of absolute magnitudes on colors and age. Our
distance calibrations are ultimately based on asteroseismology, and we show how
the distance scale can be used to test the accuracy of seismic scaling
relations. Within the uncertainties our calibrations are in agreement with
those built upon local red clump with Hipparcos} parallaxes, although we find a

instantaneous electronic Kerr response and the residual Raman molecular
vibrational response. To design efficient, accurate, and stable computational
methods, we apply high order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in space to
the hybrid PDE-ODE Maxwell system with several choices of numerical fluxes, and

established. When we turn to fully discrete methods, the challenge to achieve
provable stability lies in the temporal discretizations of the nonlinear terms.

characterised by the presence of a local maximum for non-vanishing film
thickness. Such a form leads to complicated instability evolution that we study
by analytical means, including application of marginal stability criteria, and
by extensive numerical simulations that help us develop a better understanding

spectrum of a galaxy the mass, age and metallicity of its constituent stellar
populations. This technique has been established as a fundamental tool in
extragalactic research. It has been extensively applied to large spectroscopic
data sets, notably the SDSS, leading to important insights into the galaxy
assembly history. However, despite significant improvements over the past
decade, all current PSS codes suffer from two major deficiencies that inhibit
us from gaining sharp insights into the star-formation history (SFH) of
galaxies and potentially introduce substantial biases in studies of their
physical properties (e.g., stellar mass, mass-weighted stellar age and specific
star formation rate). These are i) the neglect of nebular emission in spectral
fits, consequently, ii) the lack of a mechanism that ensures consistency
between the best-fitting SFH and the observed nebular emission characteristics
of a star-forming (SF) galaxy. In this article, we present FADO (Fitting
Analysis using Differential evolution Optimization): a conceptually novel,
publicly available PSS tool with the distinctive capability of permitting
identification of the SFH that reproduces the observed nebular characteristics
of a SF galaxy. This so-far unique self-consistency concept allows us to
significantly alleviate degeneracies in current spectral synthesis. The
innovative character of FADO is further augmented by its mathematical
foundation: FADO is the first PSS code employing genetic differential evolution
optimization. This, in conjunction with other unique elements in its
mathematical concept (e.g., optimization of the spectral library using
artificial intelligence, convergence test, quasi-parallelization) results in
key improvements with respect to computational efficiency and uniqueness of the
best-fitting SFHs.

following five years, the source slowly brightened by approximately one
magnitude, to V~16.2. Only ~1 in 10,000 quasars show such extreme variability,
as quantified by the extreme parameters derived for this quasar assuming a
damped random walk model. A combination of archival and newly acquired spectra
reveal the source to be an iron low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL)
quasar with extreme changes in its absorption spectrum. Some absorption
features completely disappear over the 9 years of optical spectra, while other
features remain essentially unchanged. We report the first definitive redshift
for this source, based on the detection of broad H-alpha in a Keck/MOSFIRE
spectrum. Absorption systems separated by several 1000 km/s in velocity show
coordinated weakening in the depths of their troughs as the continuum flux
increases. We interpret the broad absorption line variability to be due to
changes in photoionization, rather than due to motion of material along our
line of sight. This source highlights one sort of rare transition object that
astronomy will now be finding through dedicated time-domain surveys.

developed along with guarantees of correct outlier detection when the inliers

as sparse linear combinations of each other, we obtain an asymmetric affinity
matrix among data points, which we use to construct a weighted directed graph.
By defining a suitable Markov Chain from this graph, we establish a connection
between inliers/outliers and essential/inessential states of the Markov chain,
which allows us to detect outliers by using random walks. We provide a
theoretical analysis that justifies the correctness of our method under
geometric and connectivity assumptions. Experimental results on image databases

neurons, often exhibit spontaneous and fairly regular spiking with frequencies
of order a few Hz, though dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons only exhibit
such pacemaker-type activity in vitro or in vivo under special conditions.
  A large number of ion channel types contribute to such spiking so that
detailed modeling of spike generation leads to the requirement of solving very
large systems of differential equations. It is useful to have simplified
mathematical models of spiking in such neurons so that, for example, features
of inputs and output spike trains can be incorporated including stochastic
effects for possible use in network models.
  In this article we investigate a simple two-component conductance-based model
of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Solutions are computed numerically and with
suitably chosen parameters mimic features of pacemaker-type spiking in the
above types of neurons. The effects of varying parameters is investigated in
detail, it being found that there is extreme sensitivity to eight of them.
Transitions from non-spiking to spiking are examined for two of these, the
half-activation potential for an activation variable and the added
(depolarizing) current and contrasted with the behavior of the classical
Hodgkin-Huxley system. The plateaux levels between spikes can be adjusted, by
changing a set of voltage parameters, to agree with experimental observations.
Experiment has shown that in, in vivo, dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons'
pacemaker activity can be induced by the removal of excitatory inputs or the
introduction of inhibitory ones. These properties are confirmed by mimicking
opposite such changes in the model, which resulted in a change from pacemaker
activity to bursting-type phenomena.

investigate the problems arising from these assumptions, focusing on those
caused by small sample sizes and sparse data. We then propose an alternative
posterior score: the Bayesian Dirichlet sparse (BDs) marginal likelihood with a
marginal uniform (MU) graph prior. Like U+BDeu, MU+BDs does not require any
prior information on the probabilistic structure of the data and can be used as
a replacement noninformative score. We study its theoretical properties and we

non-linear analysis of multi-channel time series, notably multivariate
multiscale entropy (mvMSE), has been extensively used in biomedical signal
processing. However, mvMSE has three drawbacks: 1) mvMSE values are either
undefined or unreliable for short signals; 2) mvMSE is not fast enough for
real-time applications; and 3) the computation of mvMSE for signals with a
large number of channels requires the storage of a huge number of elements.
Methods: To deal with these problems and improve the stability of mvMSE, we
introduce multivariate multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE - mvMDE) as an
extension of our recently developed MDE, to quantify the complexity of
multivariate time series. Results: We assess mvMDE, in comparison with mvMSE
and multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (mvMFE), on correlated and
uncorrelated multi-channel noise signals, bivariate autoregressive processes,
and three biomedical datasets. The results show that mvMDE takes into account
dependencies in patterns across both the time and spatial domains. The mvMDE,
mvMSE, and mvMFE methods are consistent in that they lead to similar
conclusions about the underlying physiological conditions. However, the
proposed mvMDE discriminates various physiological states of the biomedical
recordings better than mvMSE and mvMFE. In addition, for both the short and
long time series, the mvMDE-based results are noticeably more stable than the
mvMSE- and mvMFE-based ones. Conclusion: For short multivariate time series,
mvMDE, unlike mvMSE, does not result in undefined values. Furthermore, mvMDE is
noticeably faster than mvMFE and mvMSE and also needs to store a considerably
smaller number of elements. Significance: Due to its ability to detect
different kinds of dynamics of multivariate signals, mvMDE has great potential
to analyse various physiological signals.

in mixed integer programming (MIP). When modeling convex disjunctive
constraints (e.g. unions of convex sets), adding auxiliary continuous variables
can sometimes help resolve this trade-off. However, standard formulations that
use such auxiliary continuous variables can have a worse-than-expected
computational effectiveness, which is often attributed precisely to these
auxiliary continuous variables. For this reason, there has been considerable
interest in constructing strong formulations that do not use continuous

these detrimental continuous auxiliary variables. To develop this technique we
introduce a natural non-polyhedral generalization of the Cayley embedding of a

are limited, due to the lack of information provided by current tactile
sensors. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a novel
method for hardness estimation, based on the GelSight tactile sensor, and the
method does not require accurate control of contact conditions or the shape of
objects. A GelSight has a soft contact interface, and provides high resolution
tactile images of contact geometry, as well as contact force and slip
conditions. In this paper, we try to use the sensor to measure hardness of
objects with multiple shapes, under a loosely controlled contact condition. The
contact is made manually or by a robot hand, while the force and trajectory are
unknown and uneven. We analyze the data using a deep constitutional (and
recurrent) neural network. Experiments show that the neural net model can
estimate the hardness of objects with different shapes and hardness ranging
from 8 to 87 in Shore 00 scale.

predict a wide range of performance-sensitive parameters which minimize
effectiveness loss, while simultaneously minimizing query latency, across all
stages of a multi-stage search architecture. Furthermore, our framework can be
easily applied in large-scale IR systems, can be trained without explicitly

minimizing the likelihood of tail-latency queries that exceed a pre-specified
performance budget. As a proof of concept, we use the prediction framework to
help alleviate the problem of tail-latency queries in early stage retrieval. On
the standard ClueWeb09B collection and 31k queries, we show that our new hybrid

learning frameworks that can generate very sharp data, even for data such as

be very hard to train, suffering from problems such as mode collapse and
disturbing visual artifacts. Batch normalization (BN) techniques have been
introduced to address the training. Though BN accelerates the training in the
beginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and
negatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and
numerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the
lack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these
issues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN
training that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality
of the generated samples. To allow a methodical evaluation, we introduce
squared Euclidean reconstruction error on a test set as a new objective
measure, to assess training performance in terms of speed, stability, and
quality of generated samples. Our experiments with a standard DCGAN
architecture on commonly used datasets (CelebA, LSUN bedroom, and CIFAR-10)
indicate that training using WN is generally superior to BN for GANs, achieving
10% lower mean squared loss for reconstruction and significantly better
qualitative results than BN. We further demonstrate the stability of WN on a

to external adsorbates. Among these gas molecules, H2 and H2S are strong
donors, NO, NO2, H2O and NH3 are effective acceptors, while CO and N2 exhibit
negligible charge transfer. The O2 molecule has very limited oxidizing ability
and a relatively weak interaction with InSe which is comparable to the N2
adsorption. A clear band gap narrowing is found for the H2S, NO2, and NH3

2) By monitoring the adsorption/desorption behavior of these gas molecules, the
population of hole states in InSe due to photon stimulation or defect

  Intelligence",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new regularization method based on virtual adversarial loss: a
new measure of local smoothness of the conditional label distribution given
input. Virtual adversarial loss is defined as the robustness of the conditional
label distribution around each input data point against local perturbation.
Unlike adversarial training, our method defines the adversarial direction
without label information and is hence applicable to semi-supervised learning.
Because the directions in which we smooth the model are only ""virtually""
adversarial, we call our method virtual adversarial training (VAT). The
computational cost of VAT is relatively low. For neural networks, the
approximated gradient of virtual adversarial loss can be computed with no more
than two pairs of forward- and back-propagations. In our experiments, we
applied VAT to supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks on multiple
benchmark datasets. With a simple enhancement of the algorithm based on the
entropy minimization principle, our VAT achieves state-of-the-art performance
for semi-supervised learning tasks on SVHN and CIFAR-10.

breaking in an otherwise conformal gauge theory. We therefore study the $SU(2)$

making the present model the first explicit realization of the Ideal Walking

take Q as one of its k nearest travel routes. To solve the problem, we first
develop an index to handle dynamic trajectory updates, so that the most
up-to-date transition data are available for answering a RkNNT query. Then we
introduce a filter refinement framework for processing RkNNT queries using the
proposed indexes. Next, we show how to use RkNNT to solve the optimal route

from a start location to an end location that could attract the maximum (or

Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our

the RkNNT problem for route planning.

seconds. The sensitivity of this method is estimated by adding simulated

These results suggest this search method can probe significantly below the

gravitational field is presented, and may serve as a valuable reference for
spacecraft orbit design for asteroid exploration. The orbital dynamics near
asteroids are very complex. According to the variation in orbit characteristics
after being affected by gravitational perturbation during the periapsis
passage, orbits near an asteroid can be classified into 9 categories: (1)
surroundingto-surrounding, (2) surrounding-to-surface, (3)
surroundingto-infinity, (4) infinity-to-infinity, (5) infinity-to-surface, (6)
infinity-to-surrounding, (7) surface-to-surface, (8) surfaceto-surrounding, and
(9) surface-to- infinity. Assume that the orbital elements are constant near
the periapsis, the gravitation potential is expanded into a harmonic series.
Then, the influence of the gravitational perturbation on the orbit is studied
analytically. The styles of orbits are dependent on the argument of periapsis,
the periapsis radius, and the periapsis velocity. Given the argument of
periapsis, the orbital energy before and after perturbation can be derived
according to the periapsis radius and the periapsis velocity. Simulations have
been performed for orbits in the gravitational field of 216 Kleopatra. The
numerical results are well consistent with analytic predictions.

bent neutral carbon dioxide molecules in terms of their vibrational levels,
electric dipole moment surfaces, and infrared spectra in the gas phase. The
considered isomers include the dioxiranylidene (cyclic) form of CO$_2$ with the
equilibrium valence angle of 72$^\circ$, belonging to the ground electronic
state, and four open structures with the valence angles of
118$^\circ$/119$^\circ$ (belonging to the singlet and triplet electronic states
$2^1\!A'$ and $1^3\!A'$, respectively) and 127$^\circ$/128$^\circ$ (states
$1^1\!A""$ and $1^3\!A""$, respectively). All studied bent structures possess
permanent dipole moments. For all isomers, the antisymmetric stretch
fundamental is the strongest infrared transition. Individual bent molecules can
be distinguished on the basis of strong absorption bands in the frequency
window 1100\,cm$^{-1}$ --- 1800\,cm$^{-1}$ as well as isotopic shifts in the
progression of antisymmetric stretch mode. Excitation of bent neutral carbon
dioxide near a perfect metal surface is also briefly discussed. It is argued
that the excitation energy from the linear ground state exhibits a red red
shift which depends on the molecule---metal distance.

nilpotent, strongly non-nilpotent and weakly non-nilpotent. The bigraded

marginally stable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In contrast to
Lyapunov-stability-based approaches---which ensure the poles of the reduced
system remain in the open left-half plane---the proposed method preserves
marginal stability by reducing the subsystem with poles on the imaginary axis
in a manner that ensures those poles remain purely imaginary. In particular,
the proposed method decomposes a marginally stable LTI system into (1) an
asymptotically stable subsystem with eigenvalues in the open left-half plane
and (2) a pure marginally stable subsystem with a purely imaginary spectrum. We
propose a method based on inner-product projection and the Lyapunov inequality
to reduce the first subsystem while preserving asymptotic stability. In
addition, we demonstrate that the pure marginally stable subsystem is a
generalized Hamiltonian system; we then propose a method based on symplectic
projection to reduce this subsystem while preserving pure marginal stability.
In addition, we propose both inner-product and symplectic balancing methods
that balance the operators associated with two quadratic energy functionals
while preserving asymptotic and pure marginal stability, respectively. We
formulate a geometric perspective that enables a unified comparison of the
proposed inner-product and symplectic projection methods. Numerical examples
illustrate the ability of the method to reduce the dimensionality of marginally
stable LTI systems while retaining accuracy and preserving marginal stability;
further, the resulting reduced-order model yields a finite infinite-time
energy, which arises from the pure marginally stable subsystem.

regret against any data sequence bounded by the empirical Rademacher complexity
of that sequence. To develop a general theory of when this type of adaptive
regret bound is achievable we establish a connection to the theory of
decoupling inequalities for martingales in Banach spaces. When the hypothesis
class is a set of linear functions bounded in some norm, such a regret bound is
achievable if and only if the norm satisfies certain decoupling inequalities
for martingales. Donald Burkholder's celebrated geometric characterization of
decoupling inequalities (1984) states that such an inequality holds if and only
if there exists a special function called a Burkholder function satisfying
certain restricted concavity properties. Our online learning algorithms are
efficient in terms of queries to this function.
  We realize our general theory by giving novel efficient algorithms for
classes including lp norms, Schatten p-norms, group norms, and reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces. The empirical Rademacher complexity regret bound implies
--- when used in the i.i.d. setting --- a data-dependent complexity bound for
excess risk after online-to-batch conversion. To showcase the power of the
empirical Rademacher complexity regret bound, we derive improved rates for a
supervised learning generalization of the online learning with low rank experts
task and for the online matrix prediction task.
  In addition to obtaining tight data-dependent regret bounds, our algorithms
enjoy improved efficiency over previous techniques based on Rademacher
complexity, automatically work in the infinite horizon setting, and are
scale-free. To obtain such adaptive methods, we introduce novel machinery, and
the resulting algorithms are not based on the standard tools of online convex
optimization.

scale velocity field, our simulations exhibit a complex behavior with
oscillating and azimuthally drifting eigenmodes as well as stationary regimes.
Within these non-oscillating regimes we find parametric resonances
characterized by a considerable enhancement of dynamo action and by a locking
of the phase of the magnetic field to the pattern of the perturbation. We find
an approximate fulfillment of the relationship between the resonant frequency
$\omega_{\rm{res}}$ of the disturbed system and the eigenfrequency $\omega_0$
of the undisturbed system given by $\omega_{\rm{res}}=2\omega_0$ which is known
from paradigmatic rotating mechanical systems and our prior study [Giesecke et

with weaker enhancement of the growth rates but without phase locking. However,
this amplification regime arises only in case of a basic (i.e. unperturbed)
state consisting of several different eigenmodes with rather close growth
rates. Qualitatively, these observations can be explained in terms of a simple
low dimensional model for the magnetic field amplitude that is derived using
Floquet theory. The observed phenomena may be of fundamental importance in
planetary dynamo models with the base flow being disturbed by periodic external
forces like precession or tides and for the realization of dynamo action under
laboratory conditions where imposed perturbations with the appropriate

since it has been suggested that a nontrivial coplanar phase, called the
$\pi$-coplanar or $\Psi$ phase, could be stabilized by quantum effects in a
certain range of anisotropy parameter $J/J_z$ besides the well-known 0-coplanar
(known also as $V$) and umbrella phases. Recently, Sellmann $et$ $al$. [Phys.
Rev. B {\bf 91}, 081104(R) (2015)] claimed that the $\pi$-coplanar phase is
absent for $S=1/2$ from an exact-diagonalization analysis in the sector of the
Hilbert space with only three down-spins (three magnons). We first reconsider
and improve this analysis by taking into account several low-lying eigenvalues
and the associated eigenstates as a function of $J/J_z$ and by sensibly
increasing the system sizes (up to 1296 spins). A careful identification
analysis shows that the lowest eigenstate is a chirally antisymmetric
combination of finite-size umbrella states for $J/J_z\gtrsim 2.218$ while it
corresponds to a coplanar phase for $J/J_z\lesssim 2.218$. However, we
demonstrate that the distinction between 0-coplanar and $\pi$-coplanar phases
in the latter region is fundamentally impossible from the symmetry-preserving
finite-size calculations with fixed magnon number.} Therefore, we also perform
a cluster mean-field plus scaling analysis for small spins $S\leq 3/2$. The
obtained results, together with the previous large-$S$ analysis, indicate that
the $\pi$-coplanar phase exists for any $S$ except for the classical limit
($S\rightarrow \infty$) and the existence range in $J/J_z$ is largest in the
most quantum case of $S=1/2$.

mass, we require the equality of the total enthalpy at the junction and that
the specific entropy for pipes with outgoing flow equals the convex combination
of all entropies that belong to pipes with incoming flow. Previously used
coupling conditions include equality of pressure or dynamic pressure. They are
restricted to the special case of a junction having only one pipe with outgoing
flow direction. Recently, Reigstad [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 75:679--702, 2015]
showed that such pressure-based coupling conditions can produce non-physical
solutions for isothermal flows through the production of mechanical energy. Our
new coupling conditions ensure energy as well as entropy conservation and also
apply to junctions connecting an arbitrary number of pipes with flexible flow
directions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the
generalised Riemann problem at a junction in the neighbourhood of constant
stationary states which belong to the subsonic region. This provides the basis

complementarity, as well as intermolecular forces. Thus, the electron density
field and electrostatic potential field of a molecule contain the ""raw

we show that deep learning can predict biological function of molecules
directly from their raw 3D approximated electron density and electrostatic
potential fields. Protein function based on EC numbers is predicted from the
approximated electron density field. In another experiment, the activity of
small molecules is predicted with quality comparable to state-of-the-art

confirmed the same $\vec{k}$-vector and showed that the correct magnetic

consistent with the expected exchange interaction hierarchy in this system. The
refined magnetic structure is compared with the known magnetic structures of
the closely related tri-rutile phases, NiSb$_2$O$_6$ and NiTa$_2$O$_6$. $\mu$SR
data finds a transition temperature of $T_N \sim$ 15 K for this system, while
the columbite polymorph exhibits a lower $T_N =$ 5.7(3) K. Our $\mu$SR
measurements also allowed us to estimate the critical exponent of the order
parameter $\beta$ for each polymorph. We found $\beta =$ 0.25(3) and 0.16(2)
for the $\beta$ and columbite polymorphs respectively. The single crystal
neutron scattering data gives a value for the critical exponent $\beta
=$~0.28(3) for $\beta$-NiNb$_2$O$_6$, in agreement with the $\mu$SR value.
While both systems have $\beta$ values less than 0.3, which is indicative of
reduced dimensionality, this effect appears to be much stronger for the

well-described by $S = 1$ spin chains, the interchain interactions in the

the calculation of charged defect structures in periodic DFT. We probe the
dependence of the proposed energy corrections to charged defect formation
energies on relaxation volumes and find that corrections such as the image
charge correction and the alignment correction, which can lead to sizable
changes in defect formation energies, have an almost negligible effect on the
charged defect relaxation volume. We also investigate the volume for the net
neutral defect reactions comprised of individual charged defects, and find that
the aggregate formation volumes have reasonable magnitudes. This work
highlights an important issue that, as for defect formation energies, the
defect formation volumes depend on the choice of reservoir. We show that
considering the change in volume of the electron reservoir in the formation
reaction of the charged defects, analogous to how volumes of atoms are
accounted for in defect formation volumes, can renormalize the formation
volumes of charged defects such that they are comparable to neutral defects.
This approach enables the description of the elastic properties of isolated
charged defects within the overall neutral material, beyond the context of the
overall defect reactions that produce the charged defect.

linearized method. The results show that there are nine equilibrium points in
the potential field of the asteroid Bennu, eight in the exterior of the body
and one in the interior of the body. Moreover, bifurcation will occur with a
variation of the density and rotation period. Different equilibrium points will
encounter each other and mix together. Thus, the number of equilibrium points
will change. The stability and topological structure of the equilibrium points
will also change because of the variation of the density and rotation period of
the asteroid. When considering the error of the density of Bennu, the range of
the dimensionless quantity covers the critical values that will lead to
bifurcation. This means that the stability of the equilibrium points is
uncertain, making the dynamical environment of Bennu much more complicated.

ranges from them being an activity indicator of magnetic fields to being the
place where coronal mass ejections and flares erupt. They are therefore also an
important ingredient of space weather. Their formation, however, is still an
unresolved problem in solar physics. Observations utilize just 2D surface
information near the spot, but it is debatable how to infer deep structures and
properties from local helioseismology. For a long time, it was believed that
flux tubes rising from the bottom of the convection zone are the origin of the
bipolar sunspot structure seen on the solar surface. However, this theory has
been challenged, in particular recently by new surface observation,
helioseismic inversions, and numerical models of convective dynamos. In this
article we discuss another theoretical approach to the formation of sunspots:
the negative effective magnetic pressure instability. This is a large-scale
instability, in which the total (kinetic plus magnetic) turbulent pressure can
be suppressed in the presence of a weak large-scale magnetic field, leading to
a converging downflow, which eventually concentrates the magnetic field within
it. Numerical simulations of forced stratified turbulence have been able to
produce strong super-equipartition flux concentrations, similar to sunspots at
the solar surface. In this framework, sunspots would only form close to the
surface due to the instability constraints on stratification and rotation.
Additionally, we present some ideas from local helioseismology, where we plan
to use the Hankel analysis to study the pre-emergence phase of a sunspot and to
constrain its deep structure and formation mechanism.

shown in this work that performance is substantially enhanced by the
introduction of algorithms for temporal and spatial subdomains in combination
with sparse matrix methods. The accuracy and efficiency of the recently
developed time spectral, generalized weighted residual method (GWRM) is
compared to that of the explicit Lax-Wendroff method and the implicit

the 1D Burger equation, a forced 1D wave equation and a coupled system of 14
linearized ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. It is found that the GWRM
is more efficient than the time-stepping methods at high accuracies. For
time-averaged solution of the two-time-scales, forced wave equation GWRM
performance exceeds the finite difference methods by an order of magnitude both

modified gravity model is significantly disfavored (at $22 \,$:$\, 1$ in terms
of betting-odds) against $\Lambda$CDM given CMB+SNIa+BAO data, because of a
dominant tension appearing in the $H_0 \,$-$\, \Omega_M$ plan. We identify the

caused by the late-time, quite smooth, phantom nature of the effective dark

baseline from one massive neutrino eigenstate to three degenerate ones, whose
absolute mass $\sum m_\nu \, / \, 3$ is allowed to take values within a
reasonable prior interval. As a net effect, the absolute neutrino mass is
inferred to be non-vanishing at $2 \sigma$ level, best-fitting at $\sum m_\nu

that a separating set of size $n + k - 1$ (where $n$ is the dimension of $X$)
can exist only for $k$-reflection groups.
  Several examples show that most of the assumptions on the group action and
the variety that we make cannot be dropped.

humans in an image that does not require any manual supervision. While a
general unsupervised technique would fail to estimate human pose, we suggest
that sufficient information about coarse pose can be obtained by observing
human motion in multiple frames. Specifically, we consider obtaining surrogate
supervision through videos as a means for obtaining motion based grouping cues.
We supplement the method using a basic object detector that detects persons.
With just these components we obtain a rough estimate of the human pose.
  With these samples for training, we train a fully convolutional neural
network (FCNN)[20] to obtain accurate dense blob based pose estimation. We show
that the results obtained are close to the ground-truth and to the results
obtained using a fully supervised convolutional pose estimation method [31] as
evaluated on a challenging dataset [15]. This is further validated by
evaluating the obtained poses using a pose based action recognition method [5].
In this setting we outperform the results as obtained using the baseline method
that uses a fully supervised pose estimation algorithm and is competitive with
a new baseline created using convolutional pose estimation with full

range of applications in the field of face recognition. Although data-driven
deep learning methods have been proposed to address this problem by seeking
solutions from ample face data, this problem is still challenging because it is
intrinsically ill-posed. This paper proposes a Two-Pathway Generative
Adversarial Network (TP-GAN) for photorealistic frontal view synthesis by
simultaneously perceiving global structures and local details. Four landmark
located patch networks are proposed to attend to local textures in addition to
the commonly used global encoder-decoder network. Except for the novel
architecture, we make this ill-posed problem well constrained by introducing a
combination of adversarial loss, symmetry loss and identity preserving loss.
The combined loss function leverages both frontal face distribution and
pre-trained discriminative deep face models to guide an identity preserving
inference of frontal views from profiles. Different from previous deep learning
methods that mainly rely on intermediate features for recognition, our method
directly leverages the synthesized identity preserving image for downstream
tasks like face recognition and attribution estimation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method not only presents compelling perceptual results but
also outperforms state-of-the-art results on large pose face recognition.

(TIE), partially coherent illumination provides speckle-free imaging,
compatibility with brightfield microscopy, and transverse resolution beyond
coherent diffraction limit. Unfortunately, in a conventional microscope with
circular illumination aperture, partial coherence tends to diminish the phase
contrast, exacerbating the inherent noise-to-resolution tradeoff in TIE
imaging, resulting in strong low-frequency artifacts and compromised imaging
resolution. Here, we demonstrate how these issues can be effectively addressed
by replacing the conventional circular illumination aperture with an annular
one. The matched annular illumination not only strongly boosts the phase
contrast for low spatial frequencies, but significantly improves the practical
imaging resolution to near the incoherent diffraction limit. By incorporating
high-numerical aperture (NA) illumination as well as high-NA objective, it is
shown, for the first time, that TIE phase imaging can achieve a transverse
resolution up to 208 nm, corresponding to an effective NA of 2.66. Time-lapse
imaging of in vitro Hela cells revealing cellular morphology and subcellular
dynamics during cells mitosis and apoptosis is exemplified. Given its
capability for high-resolution QPI as well as the compatibility with widely
available brightfield microscopy hardware, the proposed approach is expected to
be adopted by the wider biology and medicine community.

superconducting critical temperature. Both photo-switch and superconducting
bolometric behavior are monitored by its resistance change with light in
visible and near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. Unlike the conventional
photodetectors, the NNF devices switch to higher resistive states with light
and the corresponding resistivity change is studied with thickness and grain
size variations. At low temperature in its superconducting state, the light
exposure shifts the superconducting transition towards lower temperature. The
room temperature photon sensing nature of the NNF is explained by the photon
assisted electron-phonon scattering mechanism while the low temperature light
response is mainly related to the heat generation which essentially changes the
effective temperature for the device and the device is capable of sensing a
temperature difference of few tens of milli-kelvins. The observed
photo-response on the transport properties of NNFs can be very important for
future superconducting photon detectors, bolometers and phase slip based device
applications.

largely unknown. Pressure, one might have hoped, could reduce the
disproportionation, making the two Bi ions equivalent and bringing the system
closer to metallicity or even to superconductivity, such as is attained at
ambient pressure upon metal doping. We address the high-pressure phase diagram
of pristine BaBiO$_3$ by ab initio DFT calculations based on GGA and hybrid
functionals in combination with crystal structure prediction methods based on
evolutionary algorithms, molecular dynamics and metadynamics. The calculated
phase diagram from 0 to 50 GPa indicates that pristine BaBiO$_3$ resists
metallization under pressure, undergoing instead at room temperature structural
phase transitions from monoclinic \textit{I2/m} to nearly tetragonal
\textit{P-1} at 7 GPa, possibly to monoclinic \textit{C2/m} at 27 GPa, and to
triclinic \textit{P1} at 43 GPa. Remarkably, all these phases sustain and in
fact increase the inequivalence of two Bi neighboring sites and of their Bi-O
bonds and, in all cases except semimetallic \textit{C2/m}, the associated
insulating character. We then present high-pressure resistivity data which
generally corroborate these results, and show that the insulating character

simulation scaling. However, by comparing to the exactly soluble independent

proportional to the determinant of a complex moment matrix with a symbol which
is supported in the whole complex plane and has a Fisher-Hartwig type of
singularity: $\det(\int_\mathbb{C} w^{i}\overline{w}^j |w-z|^\gamma
e^{-N|w|^{2}}d^2 w)_{i,j=0}^{N-1}$. We study the asymptotics of this

of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight $|w-z|^\gamma
e^{-N|w|^2}d^2 w$ along with differential identities familiar from the study of
asymptotics of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants with Fisher-Hartwig
singularities. To our knowledge, even in the case of one singularity, the
asymptotics of the determinant of such a moment matrix whose symbol has support
in a two-dimensional set and a Fisher-Hartwig singularity, have been previously
unknown.

higher than $97\%$ under suitable coupling between the two TI surface states

oscillation envelope in the behavior of the angle averaged conductance, with
the variation of the length of the superconductor. The behavior of co-tunneling
(CT) probability is also very sensitive to the coupling and other parameters.
Finally, we also explore the shot noise cross correlation and show that the
behavior of the same can be monotonic or non-monotonic depending on the doping
concentration in the normal region. Under suitable circumstances, shot noise
cross correlation can change sign from positive to negative or vice versa

polarizability, whose real and imaginary parts are associated with the
potential energy and photon-scattering rate respectively. In this article we
develop a formalism to calculate analytically the real and imaginary parts of
the scalar, vector and tensor polarizabilities of lanthanide atoms. We assume
that the sum-over-state formula only comprises transitions involving electrons
in the valence orbitals like $6s$, $5d$, $6p$ or $7s$, while transitions
involving $4f$ core electrons are neglected. Applying this formalism to the
ground level of configuration $4f^q6s^2$, we restrict the sum to transitions
implying the $4f^q6s6p$ configuration, which yields polarizabilities depending
on two parameters: an effective transition energy and an effective transition
dipole moment. Then, by introducing configuration-interaction mixing between
$4f^q6s6p$ and other configurations, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of
the scalar, vector and tensor polarizabilities is very sensitive to
configuration-interaction coefficients, whereas the real part is not. The
magnitude and anisotropy of the photon-scattering rate is thus strongly related
to the details of the atomic electronic structure. Those analytical results
agree with our detailed electronic-structure calculations of energy levels,
Land\'e $g$-factors, transition probabilities, polarizabilities and van der
Waals $C_6$ coefficients, previously performed on erbium and dysprosium, and
presently performed on holmium. Our results show that, although the density of
states decreases with increasing $q$, the configuration interaction between
$4f^q6s6p$, $4f^{q-1}5d6s^2$ and $4f^{q-1}5d^26s$ is surprisingly stronger in
erbium ($q=12$), than in holmium ($q=11$), itself stronger than in dysprosium
($q=10$).

Special attention is paid to explore possible spatial (anti-)correlations of

CO/H{\sc i} emission. We present a series of simulated images of RX
J1713.7$-$3946 for CTA based on a set of observationally motivated models for
the gamma-ray emission. In these models, VHE gamma rays produced by high-energy
electrons are assumed to trace the non-thermal X-ray emission observed by {\it
XMM-Newton}, whereas those originating from relativistic protons delineate the
local gas distributions. The local atomic and molecular gas distributions are
deduced by the NANTEN team from CO and H{\sc i} observations. Our primary goal
is to show how one can distinguish the emission mechanism(s) of the gamma rays
(i.e., hadronic vs leptonic, or a mixture of the two) through information
provided by their spatial distribution, spectra, and time variation. This work
is the first attempt to quantitatively evaluate the capabilities of CTA to
achieve various proposed scientific goals by observing this important cosmic

fashion brands: mega couture, small couture, designers, and high street. We
find that while product-only images make up the majority of fashion
conversation in terms of volume, body snaps and face images that portray
fashion items more naturally tend to receive a larger number of likes and

automated tool for classifying or generating influential fashion information.

composed of two fermions: one at PeV scale and the other at TeV scale such that
the heavier one can decay into the lighter one and two neutrinos. The gauge
annihilation cross sections of PeV dark matter are not large enough to generate
its relic abundance within the observed limit. We include a pair of real scalar
triplets $\Omega_{L,R}$ which can bring the thermally overproduced PeV dark
matter abundance into the observed range through late time decay and consequent
entropy release thereby providing a consistent way to obtain the correct relic
abundance without violating the unitarity bound on dark matter mass. Another
scalar field, a bitriplet under left-right gauge group is added to assist the
heavier dark matter decay. The presence of an approximate global $U(1)_X$
symmetry can naturally explain the origin of tiny couplings required for
long-lived nature of these decaying particles. We also show, how such an
extended LRSM can be incorporated within a non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ model
where the gauge coupling unification at a very high scale naturally accommodate
a PeV scale intermediate symmetry, required to explain the PeV events at
IceCube.

parameters carefully selected by experienced users. However, for naive users,
the intuitive way to obtain a desired texture is to provide semantic
descriptions such as ""regular,"" ""lacelike,"" and ""repetitive"" and then a
procedural model with proper parameters will be automatically suggested to
generate the corresponding textures. By contrast, it is less practical for
users to learn mathematical models and tune parameters based on multiple
examinations of large numbers of generated textures. In this study, we propose
a novel framework that generates procedural textures according to user-defined
semantic descriptions, and we establish a mapping between procedural models and
semantic texture descriptions. First, based on a vocabulary of semantic
attributes collected from psychophysical experiments, a multi-label learning
method is employed to annotate a large number of textures with semantic
attributes to form a semantic procedural texture dataset. Then, we derive a low
dimensional semantic space in which the semantic descriptions can be separated
from one other. Finally, given a set of semantic descriptions, the diverse
properties of the samples in the semantic space can lead the framework to find
an appropriate generation model that uses appropriate parameters to produce a
desired texture. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is
effective and that the generated textures closely correlate with the input
semantic descriptions.

supersedes the widely used conventional hydrodynamics (CHD) of one-dimensional
Bose gases. We illustrate this by studying ""nonlinear sound waves"" emanating
from initial density accumulations in the Lieb-Liniger model. We show that, at
zero temperature and in the absence of shocks, GHD reduces to CHD, thus for the
first time justifying its use from purely hydrodynamic principles. We show that
sharp profiles, which appear in finite times in CHD, immediately dissolve into
a higher hierarchy of reductions of GHD, with no sustained shock. CHD thereon
fails to capture the correct hydrodynamics. We establish the correct
hydrodynamic equations, which are finite-dimensional reductions of GHD
characterized by multiple, disjoint Fermi seas. We further verify that at
nonzero temperature, CHD fails at all nonzero times. Finally, we numerically
confirm the emergence of hydrodynamics at zero temperature by comparing its
predictions with a full quantum simulation performed using the NRG-TSA-ABACUS
algorithm. The analysis is performed in the full interaction range, and is not
restricted to either weak- or strong-repulsion regimes.

demonstrated that CDI electrodes exhibit selective ion removal based on ion

relaxes the point ion assumption by incorporating ion volume exclusion
interactions into a description of the micropore EDLs. The developed model is a

\times n}$ is a fundamental task in countless applications. In matrix
multiplication time, it is possible to perform a full SVD and directly compute
the singular values $\sigma_1,...,\sigma_n$. However, little is known about
algorithms that break this runtime barrier.
  Using tools from stochastic trace estimation, polynomial approximation, and
fast system solvers, we show how to efficiently isolate different ranges of
$A$'s spectrum and approximate the number of singular values in these ranges.
We thus effectively compute a histogram of the spectrum, which can stand in for
the true singular values in many applications.
  We use this primitive to give the first algorithms for approximating a wide
class of symmetric matrix norms in faster than matrix multiplication time. For
example, we give a $(1 + \epsilon)$ approximation algorithm for the
Schatten-$1$ norm (the nuclear norm) running in just $\tilde O((nnz(A)n^{1/3} +
n^2)\epsilon^{-3})$ time for $A$ with uniform row sparsity or $\tilde
O(n^{2.18} \epsilon^{-3})$ time for dense matrices. The runtime scales smoothly
for general Schatten-$p$ norms, notably becoming $\tilde O (p \cdot nnz(A)
\epsilon^{-3})$ for any $p \ge 2$.
  At the same time, we show that the complexity of spectrum approximation is
inherently tied to fast matrix multiplication in the small $\epsilon$ regime.
We prove that achieving milder $\epsilon$ dependencies in our algorithms would
imply faster than matrix multiplication time triangle detection for general
graphs. This further implies that highly accurate algorithms running in
subcubic time yield subcubic time matrix multiplication. As an application of
our bounds, we show that precisely computing all effective resistances in a
graph in less than matrix multiplication time is likely difficult, barring a
major algorithmic breakthrough.

results to demonstrate that by subjecting a multiband superconductor with
interband scattering to a time-dependent drive even-frequency pair amplitudes
can be converted to odd-frequency pair amplitudes and vice versa. We will
discuss the physical conditions under which these pair symmetry conversions can
be achieved and possible experimental signatures of their presence.

flows as controlled flows but ensure that the flow rates of all uncontrolled
flows can still satisfy the minimum required rates by TCP. We prove that SPFRCS

that JFSRD performs nearly optimally in small-scale networks, and the number of

the long-term physically observable behaviors of the system. The study of
attractors and the search for distinct types of attractor have been a central
task in nonlinear dynamics. In smooth dynamical systems, an attractor is often
enclosed completely in its basin of attraction with a finite distance from the
basin boundary. Recent works have uncovered that, in neuronal networks,
unstable attractors with a remote basin can arise, where almost every point on
the attractor is locally transversely repelling. Herewith we report our
discovery of a class of attractors: partially unstable attractors, in
pulse-coupled integrate-and-fire networks subject to a periodic forcing. The
defining feature of such an attractor is that it can simultaneously possess
locally stable and unstable sets, both of positive measure. Exploiting the
structure of the key dynamical events in the network, we develop a symbolic
analysis that can fully explain the emergence of the partially unstable
attractors. To our knowledge, such exotic attractors have not been reported

model across training and testing data with different distributions. Most
previous research tackle this problem in seeking a shared feature
representation between source and target domains while reducing the mismatch of
their data distributions. In this paper, we propose a close yet discriminative
domain adaptation method, namely CDDA, which generates a latent feature
representation with two interesting properties. First, the discrepancy between
the source and target domain, measured in terms of both marginal and
conditional probability distribution via Maximum Mean Discrepancy is minimized
so as to attract two domains close to each other. More importantly, we also
design a repulsive force term, which maximizes the distances between each label
dependent sub-domain to all others so as to drag different class dependent
sub-domains far away from each other and thereby increase the discriminative
power of the adapted domain. Moreover, given the fact that the underlying data
manifold could have complex geometric structure, we further propose the
constraints of label smoothness and geometric structure consistency for label
propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 36 cross-domain image
classification tasks over four public datasets. The comprehensive results show
that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
with significant margins.

equipped with appropriate boundary conditions. Catering to more realistic
applications, in the present article we have extended the work done on the one
plus one dimensional Boltzmann equation to the Boltzmann equation involving
multi-dimensions in physical and velocity space. Criteria for stable boundary
conditions, using energy estimates, have been discussed for linear symmetric
hyperbolic initial boundary value problems. Since the use of energy estimates
requires the hyperbolic system to be symmetric, the symmetric hyperbolicity of
the moment equations arising from a Hermite discretization of the Boltzmann
equation has been studied. Furthermore, an algorithm to construct a general
symmetrizer for an arbitrary order Hermite discretization has been presented. A
block structure for the multi-dimensional moment equations has been recognised
which has been used to construct stable Onsager boundary conditions. The newly
proposed Onsager boundary conditions have been used to study a Poisson heat
conduction problem using a higher order Hermite discretization; the results
have been compared to those obtained from the Maxwell's accommodation model.

  function of neural circuits through reward-based learning",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of
continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In
fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component
of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the
history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent
with common models for network plasticity, and raise the questions how neural
circuits can maintain a stable computational function in spite of these
continuously ongoing processes, and what functional uses these ongoing
processes might have. Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for
these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context
of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous
processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the
capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for
specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes
in the network or task. Furthermore we show theoretically and through computer
simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with
continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good
computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network
architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural
activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of
reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of
reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network
configurations.

our recent convergence results for asynchronous imitation dynamics on networks,
we consider how such networks can be efficiently driven to a desired
equilibrium state by offering payoff incentives for using a certain strategy,
either uniformly or targeted to individuals. In particular, if for each
available strategy, agents playing that strategy receive maximum payoff when
their neighbors play that same strategy, we show that providing incentives to
agents in a network that is at equilibrium will result in convergence to a
unique new equilibrium. For the case when a uniform incentive can be offered to
all agents, this result allows the computation of the optimal incentive using a
binary search algorithm. When incentives can be targeted to individual agents,
we propose an algorithm to select which agents should be chosen based on
iteratively maximizing a ratio of the number of agents who adopt the desired
strategy to the payoff incentive required to get those agents to do so.
Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm computes near-optimal
targeted payoff incentives for a range of networks and payoff distributions in
coordination games.
