Petri nets. Deterministic negotiation diagrams, equivalent to the much studied
and used free-choice workflow Petri nets, are surprisingly amenable to
verification. Soundness (a property close to deadlock-freedom) can be decided
in PTIME. Further, other fundamental questions like computing summaries or the
expected cost, can also be solved in PTIME for sound deterministic negotiation
diagrams, while they are PSPACE-complete in the general case.
  In this paper we generalize and explain these results. We extend the
classical ""meet-over-all-paths"" (MOP) formulation of static analysis problems
to our concurrent setting, and introduce Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis
problems, which encompass the questions above and new ones. We show that any
Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis problem can be solved in PTIME for sound
deterministic negotiations whenever it is in PTIME for sequential
flow-graphs---even though the flow-graph of a deterministic negotiation diagram
can be exponentially larger than the diagram itself. This gives a common
explanation to the low-complexity of all the analysis questions studied so far.
Finally, we show that classical gen/kill analyses are also an instance of our
framework, and obtain a PTIME algorithm for detecting anti-patterns in
free-choice workflow Petri nets.
  Our result is based on a novel decomposition theorem, of independent
interest, showing that sound deterministic negotiation diagrams can be
hierarchically decomposed into (possibly overlapping) smaller sound diagrams.

characteristics of semiconductors like diode, and transistor. Using the circuit
theory laws, a generalized equation is obtained. The main concern of the thesis
is to investigate how perturbing the input signal will affect the output
variables. The problem is studied in two cases: the static case, where the
input signal is a DC source; and the dynamic case, where there exists an AC
source in the circuit.
  In the static case, the problem can be reduced to the existence or absence of
local stability properties of the solution map, like the Aubin property,
isolated calmness, and calmness, or metric regularity for the inverse map. Some
tools from variational analysis are used to provide necessary and/or sufficient
conditions that guarantee these properties. In the dynamic case, those
pointwise results are used to obtain descriptions for regularity properties of
the solution trajectories in function spaces.

CMC foliation with $S^3$ spatial topology. The solutions I find, in this
context, will be both solutions of Shape Dynamics and General Relativity. The
aim is to describe a system undergoing gravitational collapse in Shape
Dynamics, so a well-justified and useful simplification is to assume spherical
symmetry. This kills all the local gravitational degrees of freedom, but some
nontrivial degrees of freedom are recovered by introducing matter. The simplest
form of matter is infinitely thin spherical shells of dust, of which I need at
least two in order to have a nontrivial dynamics. With a single shell the
system is dynamically trivial, but it nevertheless admits a solution which
represents a `frozen' shell at equilibrium in a globally de Sitter universe.
Such a solution is, to my knowledge, new. I am able to solve analytically also
the case with two shells, which has a nontrivial dynamics. When the rest mass
of one shell is much smaller than the other, the system is suitable to model a
compact universe in which one subsystem (the `light' shell) undergoes
gravitational collapse while the rest of the matter (the `heavy' shell) plays
the role of spectator. It turns out that, if the cosmological constant is zero
or positive but small, and the rest mass of the two shells are sufficiently
different, when the `light' shells collapses the ADM equations become
ill-defined and cease to admit a solution. The shape-dynamical description,
however, seems still well defined and can be continued past this point,
possibly signalling a departure of Shape Dynamics from exact equivalence with
General Relativity.

success. Moreover, analysis of the ensemble of solutions revealed that
task-specificity of TE-network clusters correlated with fitness. This provides
an empirically testable hypothesis that links network structure to behavior.

stable sorting, where mergesort is often combined with insertion sort to

conventional belief, the coupling of a quantum electronic device to its

substrate functions as a mechanical oscillator. We carry out a theoretical
analysis of this coupling in the case of a quantum point contact (QPC). First
we derive the noise power spectrum from the Hamiltonian without making the
Markovian approximation, and obtain numerical results that reproduce the
experimental data. Next we investigate the nature of the coupling. In most
previous analyses, the coupling of an electronic device to a mechanical
oscillator has been modeled as a position coupling. We model it both as a
position coupling and as a momentum coupling and compare the results. We find
that, as long as one includes backaction between position and momentum, the
assumed mode of coupling makes little difference, since the backaction
transmits momentum fluctuations to position fluctuations and vice versa.
Finally, we ask whether the salient features of the model persist in the
Markovian approximation. We find that a Markovian analysis confirms the
QPC-substrate coupling, but underestimates the noise floor and leads to
excessively sharp and narrow noise peaks around the resonant frequencies.

increasingly important, with a rise in the number of devices making continuous
service requests and with the significant recent take up of latency-sensitive
applications, such as streaming and real-time data processing. Fog computing
provides a solution to such types of applications by bridging the gap between
the user and public/private cloud infrastructure via the inclusion of a ""fog""
layer. Such approach is capable of reducing the overall processing latency, but
the issues of redundancy, cost-effectiveness in utilizing such computing
infrastructure and handling services on the basis of a difference in their
characteristics remain. This difference in characteristics of services because
of variations in the requirement of computational resources and processes is
termed as service heterogeneity. A potential solution to these issues is the
use of Osmotic Computing -- a recently introduced paradigm that allows division
of services on the basis of their resource usage, based on parameters such as
energy, load, processing time on a data center vs. a network edge resource.
Service provisioning can then be divided across different layers of a
computational infrastructure, from edge devices, in-transit nodes, and a data
center, and supported through an Osmotic software layer. In this paper, a
fitness-based Osmosis algorithm is proposed to provide support for osmotic
computing by making more effective use of existing Fog server resources. The
proposed approach is capable of efficiently distributing and allocating
services by following the principle of osmosis. The results are presented using
numerical simulations demonstrating gains in terms of lower allocation time and
a higher probability of services being handled with high resource utilization.

trivial conservation law of the second kind. This is at odds with previous
studies which claimed that potential vorticity conservation relates to a

Lagrangian density, a canonical Hamiltonian formulation is obtained in which
Dirac constraints explicitly include the (possibly time-dependent) metric

the second class, which implies that no local gauge symmetry transformations of
Clebsch fields exist. Finally, the corresponding non-canonical Hamiltonian

trajectories and are often amenable to separable Lyapunov functions that are
either the sum or the maximum of a collection of functions of a scalar
argument. In this paper, we consider constructing separable Lyapunov functions
for monotone systems that are also contractive, that is, the distance between
any pair of trajectories exponentially decreases. The distance is defined in
terms of a possibly state-dependent norm. When this norm is a weighted
one-norm, we obtain conditions which lead to sum-separable Lyapunov functions,
and when this norm is a weighted infinity-norm, symmetric conditions lead to
max-separable Lyapunov functions. In addition, we consider two classes of
Lyapunov functions: the first class is separable along the system's state, and
the second class is separable along components of the system's vector field.
The latter case is advantageous for many practically motivated systems for
which it is difficult to measure the system's state but easier to measure the
system's velocity or rate of change. In addition, we present an algorithm based
on sum-of-squares programming to compute such separable Lyapunov functions. We
provide several examples to demonstrate our results.

challenging. It requires reasoning about bounding boxes of different classes,
locations \etc. Above all, instance-level spatial reasoning inherently requires
modeling conditional distributions on previous detections. Unfortunately, our
current object detection systems do not have any {\bf memory} to remember what
to condition on! The state-of-the-art object detectors still detect all object
in parallel followed by non-maximal suppression (NMS). While memory has been
used for tasks such as captioning, they mostly use image-level memory cells
without capturing the spatial layout. On the other hand, modeling object-object
relationships requires {\bf spatial} reasoning -- not only do we need a memory
to store the spatial layout, but also a effective reasoning module to extract
spatial patterns. This paper presents a conceptually simple yet powerful
solution -- Spatial Memory Network (SMN), to model the instance-level context
efficiently and effectively. Our spatial memory essentially assembles object
instances back into a pseudo ""image"" representation that is easy to be fed into
another ConvNet for object-object context reasoning. This leads to a new
sequential reasoning architecture where image and memory are processed in
parallel to obtain detections which update the memory again. We show our SMN
direction is promising as it provides 2.2\% improvement over baseline Faster

magnetic fields known as extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has recently been
explored in a new materials context with topological semimetals. Exemplified by
WTe$_{2}$ and rare earth monopnictide La(Sb,Bi), these systems tend to be
non-magnetic, nearly compensated semimetals and represent a platform for large
magnetoresistance driven by intrinsic electronic structure. Here we explore
electronic transport in magnetic members of the latter family of semimetals and
find that XMR is strongly modulated by magnetic order. In particular, CeSb
exhibits XMR in excess of $1.6 \times 10^{6}$ % at fields of 9 T while the
magnetoresistance itself is non-monotonic across the various magnetic phases
and shows a transition from negative magnetoresistance to XMR with field above
magnetic ordering temperature $T_{N}$. The magnitude of the XMR is larger than
in other rare earth monopnictides including the non-magnetic members and
follows an non-saturating power law to fields above 30 T. We show that the
overall response can be understood as the modulation of conductivity by the Ce
orbital state and for intermediate temperatures can be characterized by an
effective medium model. Comparison to the orbitally quenched compound GdBi
supports the correlation of XMR with the onset of magnetic ordering and
compensation and highlights the unique combination of orbital inversion and
type-I magnetic ordering in CeSb in determining its large response. These
findings suggest a paradigm for magneto-orbital control of XMR and are relevant
to the understanding of rare earth-based correlated topological materials.

significantly longer than the time scales of processes governing the evolution
of interstellar gas. We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a
star-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this
evolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation
rate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted
into stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical
processes. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,
which results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.
Our model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to
interpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies
and the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In
particular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation
rate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation
efficiency. We illustrate our model using the results of an isolated
$L_*$-sized galaxy simulation that reproduces the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation for both molecular and atomic gas. Interestingly, the relation for
molecular gas is almost linear on kiloparsec scales, although a nonlinear
relation is adopted in simulation cells. We discuss how a linear relation
emerges from non-self-similar scaling of the gas density PDF with the average
gas surface density.

most importantly in the destruction of molecular star-forming clouds, resulting
in inefficient star formation on galactic scales. On cloud scales, ionizing
radiation creates \hii regions, while stellar winds and supernovae drive the
ISM into thin shells. These shells are accelerated by the combined effect of
winds, radiation pressure and supernova explosions, and slowed down by gravity.
Since radiative and mechanical feedback is highly interconnected, they must be
taken into account in a self-consistent and combined manner, including the
coupling of radiation and matter. We present a new semi-analytic
one-dimensional feedback model for isolated massive clouds ($\geq
10^5\,M_{\odot}$) to calculate shell dynamics and shell structure
simultaneously. It allows us to scan a large range of physical parameters (gas
density, star formation efficiency, metallicity) and to estimate escape
fractions of ionizing radiation $f_{\rm{esc,i}}$, the minimum star formation
efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm{min}}$ required to drive an outflow, and recollapse
time scales for clouds that are not destroyed by feedback. Our results show
that there is no simple answer to the question of what dominates cloud
dynamics, and that each feedback process significantly influences the
efficiency of the others. We find that variations in natal cloud density can
very easily explain differences between dense-bound and diffuse-open star
clusters. We also predict, as a consequence of feedback, a $4-6$ Myr age
difference for massive clusters with multiple generations.

infalling into the cluster. However, in addition, we see a clear trend between
total mass loss due to cluster tides, and time since infall. Thus we find
location in phase-space provides information on both infall time, and tidal
mass loss. We find the predictive power of phase-space diagrams remains even

projected distances from the cluster). We provide figures that can be directly

transition regime. To investigate the full scope of the problem, we employed
the two widely adopted Block-Model of acoustic fluidization scaling assumptions
(scaling block size by impactor size and scaling by coupling parameter) and
compared their outcomes. Impactor size and velocity were varied, such that
large/slow and small/fast impactors would produce craters of the same diameter
within a suite of simulations, ranging in diameter from 10-26 km, which
straddles the simple-to-complex crater transition on Moon. Our study suggests
that the transition from simple to complex structures is highly sensitive to
the choice of the time decay and viscosity constants in the Block-Model of
acoustic fluidization. Moreover, the combination of impactor size and velocity
plays a greater role than previously thought in the morphology of craters in
the simple-to-complex size range. We propose that scaling of block size by
impactor size is an appropriate choice for modeling simple-to-complex craters
on planetary surfaces, including both varying and constant impact velocities,
as the modeling results are more consistent with the observed morphology of
lunar craters. This scaling suggests that the simple-to-complex transition
occurs at a larger crater size, if higher impact velocities are considered, and
is consistent with the observation that the simple-to-complex transition occurs
at larger sizes on Mercury than Mars.

Generating microcombs in the visible wavelength range, however, has been
limited by large material dispersion and optical loss. Here we demonstrate a
scheme for efficiently generating visible microcomb in a high Q aluminum

22% is achieved from the pump laser to the visible comb. We further demonstrate
a robust frequency tuning of the visible comb by more than one free spectral
range and apply it to the absorption spectroscopy of a water-based dye molecule

  the final pre-publication version; to appear in Duke Math. Jour",,,,"math.GT math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rank of a hierarchically hyperbolic space is the maximal number of
unbounded factors in a standard product region. For hierarchically hyperbolic
groups, this coincides with the maximal dimension of a quasiflat. Examples for
which the rank coincides with familiar quantities include: the dimension of
maximal Dehn twist flats for mapping class groups, the maximal rank of a free
abelian subgroup for right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups, and, for the
Weil--Petersson metric, the rank is the integer part of half the complex
dimension of Teichm\""{u}ller space.
  We prove that any quasiflat of dimension equal to the rank lies within finite
distance of a union of standard orthants (under a mild condition satisfied by
all natural examples). This resolves outstanding conjectures when applied to
various examples. For mapping class group, we verify a conjecture of Farb; for
Teichm\""{u}ller space we answer a question of Brock; for CAT(0) cubical groups,
we handle special cases including right-angled Coxeter groups. An important
ingredient in the proof is that the hull of any finite set in an HHS is
quasi-isometric to a CAT(0) cube complex of dimension bounded by the rank.
  We deduce a number of applications. For instance, we show that any
quasi-isometry between HHSs induces a quasi-isometry between certain simpler
HHSs. This allows one, for example, to distinguish quasi-isometry classes of
right-angled Artin/Coxeter groups. Another application is to quasi-isometric
rigidity. Our tools in many cases allow one to reduce the problem of
quasi-isometric rigidity for a given hierarchically hyperbolic group to a
combinatorial problem. We give a new proof of quasi-isometric rigidity of
mapping class groups, which, given our general quasiflats theorem, uses simpler
combinatorial arguments than in previous proofs.

spin-inversion symmetry for all but the anisotropies $\tilde \Delta_{MN} =
\cos(\pi M /N)$ with $N > M$ and coprime, provided system sizes $L \ge 2N$, for
which states with different spin-inversion signature become degenerate due to
the underlying $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry. All these loop-algebra degenerate
states carry finite currents which we conjecture [based on $L$ and anisotropies
$\tilde \Delta_{MN}$ (with $N<L/2$) available to us] to dominate the
grand-canonical ensemble evaluation of $D$ in the thermodynamic limit.
Including a magnetic flux not only breaks spin-inversion in the zero
magnetization sector but also lifts the loop-algebra degeneracies in all
symmetry sectors --- this effect is more pertinent at smaller $\Delta$ due to
the larger contributions to $D$ coming from the low-magnetization sectors which
are more sensitive to the system's symmetries. Thus we generically find a
finite $D$ for fluxed rings and arbitrary $0<\Delta<1$ in both ensembles. In
contrast, at the isotropic point and in the gapped phase ($\Delta \ge 1$) $D$
is found to vanish in the thermodynamic limit, independent of symmetry or
ensemble. Our analysis demonstrates how convergence to the thermodynamic limit
within the gapless phase ($\Delta < 1$) may be accelerated and the finite-size
anomalies overcome: $D$ extrapolates nicely in the thermodynamic limit to
either the recently computed lower-bound or the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz

a nighttime thermal image from the Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR)
which shows a thermal anomaly at the same location, within the uncertainties
(Spencer et al. 1999). The anomaly has the highest observed brightness
temperature on the Europa nightside. If heat flow from a subsurface liquid
water reservoir causes the thermal anomaly, its depth is ~1.8-2 km, under
simple modeling assumptions, consistent with scenarios in which a liquid water
reservoir has formed within a thick ice shell. Models that favor thin regions
within the ice shell that connect directly to the ocean, however, cannot be
excluded, nor modifications to surface thermal inertia by subsurface activity.
Alternatively, vapor deposition surrounding an active vent could increase the
thermal inertia of the surface and cause the thermal anomaly. This candidate
plume region may offer a promising location for an initial characterization of
Europa's internal water and ice and for seeking evidence of Europa's

However, when we account for the geometry effects of an expanding Universe,
neglected by the previous studies, this increase in T/f at z > 1 is preceded by
a decrease at z < 1. Using high resolution radio images of the background
continuum sources, we can transform the T/f degeneracy to T/d^2, where d is the
projected linear size of the absorber. Again, there is no overall increase with
redshift, although a dip at z ~ 2 persists. Furthermore, we find d^2/T to
follow a similar variation with redshift as the star formation rate. This
suggests that, although the total hydrogen column density shows little relation
to the SFR, the fraction of the cold neutral medium may. Therefore, further
efforts to link the neutral gas with the star formation history should also
consider the cool component of the gas.

cubic and quartic couplings, or getting equivalently information on the exact
shape of the Higgs potential, is therefore an essential task. However, direct
measurements beyond the cubic self-interaction of the Higgs boson consist of a
huge challenge, even for a future proton-proton collider expected to operate at
a center-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. We present a novel approach to extract
model-independent constraints on the triple and quartic Higgs self-coupling by
investigating triple Higgs-boson hadroproduction at a center-of-mass energy of
100 TeV, focusing on the $\tau \tau b \bar{b} b \bar{b}$ channel that was
previously overlooked due to a supposedly too large background. It is thrown
into sharp relief that the assist from transverse variables such as $m_{T2}$
and a boosted configuration ensures a high signal sensitivity. We derive the
luminosities that would be required to constrain given deviations from the
Standard Model in the Higgs self-interactions, showing for instance that a
$2\sigma$ sensitivity could be achieved for an integrated luminosity of 30
ab$^{-1}$ when Standard Model properties are assumed. With the prospects of
combining these findings with other triple-Higgs search channels, the Standard
Model Higgs quartic coupling could in principle be reached with a significance

coins they spend. In this paper, we empirically evaluate two weaknesses in
Monero's mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62% of transaction inputs with
one or more mixins are vulnerable to ""chain-reaction"" analysis -- that is, the
real input can be deduced by elimination. Second, Monero mixins are sampled in
such a way that they can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their
age distribution; in short, the real input is usually the ""newest"" input. We
estimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80%
accuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Next, we turn to the
Monero ecosystem and study the importance of mining pools and the former
anonymous marketplace AlphaBay on the transaction volume. We find that after
removing mining pool activity, there remains a large amount of potentially
privacy-sensitive transactions that are affected by these weaknesses. We
propose and evaluate two countermeasures that can improve the privacy of future
transactions.

sails using either solar radiation pressure or directed energy. This idea
constitutes the thesis behind the Breakthrough Starshot project, which aims to
accelerate a gram-mass spacecraft up to one-fifth the speed of light towards
Proxima Centauri. For such a case, the combination of the sail's low mass and
relativistic velocity render previous treatments formally incorrect, including
that of Einstein himself in his seminal 1905 paper introducing special
relativity. To address this, we present formulae for a sail's acceleration,
first in response to a single photon and then extended to an ensemble. We show
how the sail's motion in response to an ensemble of incident photons is
equivalent to that of a single photon of energy equal to that of the ensemble.
We use this 'principle of ensemble equivalence' for both perfect and imperfect
mirrors, enabling a simple analytic prediction of the sail's velocity curve.
Using our results and adopting putative parameters for Starshot, we estimate
that previous relativistic treatments underestimate the spacecraft's terminal
velocity by ~50m/s for the same incident energy, sufficient to miss a target by
several Earth radii. Additionally, we use a simple model to predict the sail's
temperature and diffraction beam losses during the laser firing period,
allowing us to estimate that for firing times of a few minutes and operating
temperatures below 300C (573K), Starshot will require a sail of which absorbs
less than 1 in 260,000 photons.

extremely strong He I emssion lines and a late-time blue pseudocontinuum. The
young SN 2015G showed narrow P-Cygni profiles of He I, but never in its
evolution did it show any signature of hydrogen - arguing for a dense, ionized,

the number of atoms $Q$ per molecule. c) The solid-like properties of feature D

coordinated spinning molecules, a model that might be testable with computer
simulations. d) There are a number of correlations between thermodynamic
quantities, including the acentric factor $\omega$, but we found little
explicit correlation between $\omega$ and the shape of a molecule. e) Feature D
seriously constrains the size of the asymptotic fluid critical point regime,

geometric optics. It is independent of the energy contents of the universe and
the validity of the Einstein equation on cosmological scales. The study
comprises two levels: testing the FLRW metric through the Distance Sum Rule and
determining/constraining cosmic curvature. We propose an effective and
efficient (redshift) evolution model for performing the former test, which
allows us to concretely specify the violation criterion for the FLRW Distance
Sum Rule. If the FLRW metric is consistent with the observations, then, on the
second level, the cosmic curvature parameter will be constrained to $\sim0.057$
or $\sim0.041$ ($1\sigma$), depending on the availability of high-redshift
supernovae, much more stringent than current model-independent techniques. We
also show that the bias in the time delay method might be well controlled,
leading to robust results. The proposed method is a new independent tool for
both testing the fundamental assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy in
cosmology and for determining cosmic curvature. It is complementary to cosmic
microwave background plus baryon acoustic oscillation analyses, which normally

Learning better shared representation and distance metric for multimedia data

ability of deep neural network in feature representation and comparison
functions learning, we propose the Unified Network for Cross-media Similarity
Metric (UNCSM) to associate cross-media shared representation learning with
distance metric in a unified framework. First, we design a two-pathway deep
network pretrained with contrastive loss, and employ double triplet similarity
loss for fine-tuning to learn the shared representation for each media type by
modeling the relative semantic similarity. Second, the metric network is
designed for effectively calculating the cross-media similarity of the shared
representation, by modeling the pairwise similar and dissimilar constraints.
Compared to the existing methods which mostly ignore the dissimilar constraints
and only use sample distance metric as Euclidean distance separately, our UNCSM
approach unifies the representation learning and distance metric to preserve
the relative similarity as well as embrace more complex similarity functions
for further improving the cross-media retrieval accuracy. The experimental
results show that our UNCSM approach outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods on

The HI properties of the Bridge TDG candidate include: M(HI) $\sim$ 6.6
$\times$ 10$^8$ msolar and V(HI) = 3500$\pm$ 7 km/s, which is in good agreement
with the velocities of the parent galaxies. Additionally the TDG's HI linewidth
of 30 km/s and a modest velocity gradient together with its SFR of 0.2

TDG. The Bridge TDG's \textit{Spitzer} 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m counterparts

However, the detailed kinematics and geometry of hidden BLRs are still not

1 AGNs may be a useful diagnostic of the nature of hidden BLRs in type 2
objects. In order to understand the hidden BLRs, we compile six type 2 objects

hole masses. All of them contain pseudobulges. We estimate their virial
factors, and find the average value is 0.60 and the standard deviation is 0.69,
which agree well with the value of type 1 AGNs with pseudobulges. This study
demonstrates that (1) the geometry and kinematics of BLR are similar in type 1

of virial factors in Seyfert 2 galaxies suggest that, similar to type 1 AGNs,
BLRs tend to be very thick disks in type 2 objects.

heating of solid-density targets can create unique dense states of matter

latter phenomena, with special emphasis on the problem of optimum target design

fully three-dimensional simulations of the incident x-ray pulse and the
resulting multielectron relaxation cascade to model the spatial energy density

nonlocal heat transport due to the motion of high energy photoelectrons and

give much improved energy density deposition in lower-Z materials, with
enhancements reaching a factor of 100. This has three important benefits.
First, it greatly enlarges the thermodynamic parameter space in XFEL x-ray
heating studies of lower-Z materials. Second, it allows the use of higher probe
photon energies, enabling higher-information content X-ray diffraction (XRD)

of an order placement process and an order cancellation process. Price limit
rules are introduced in the definition of relative price. The order placement
process is determined by several empirical regularities: the long memory in
order directions, the long memory in relative prices, the asymmetric
distribution of relative prices, and the nonlinear dependence of the average
order size and its standard deviation on the relative price. Order cancellation
follows a Poisson process with the arrival rate determined from real data and
the cancelled order is determined according to the empirical distributions of
relative price level and relative position at the same price level. All these
ingredients of the model are derived based on the empirical microscopic
regularities in the order flows of stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The
model is able to produce the main stylized facts in real markets. Computational
experiments uncover that asymmetric setting of price limits will cause the
stock price diverging exponentially when the up price limit is higher than the
down price limit and vanishing vice versus. We also find that asymmetric price
limits have influences on stylized facts. Our EBOD model provides a suitable
computational experiment platform for academics, market participants and policy

matter in the density region of about one to four times of normal nuclear
matter density, $\rho_B \sim 1 - 4\rho_0$. The onset density of $\Delta$ matter
depends on the chiral invariant mass of $\Delta$, $m_{\Delta0}$: The lager
$m_{\Delta0}$, the bigger the onset density. The $\Delta$ matter of $\rho_B
\sim 1 - 4\rho_0$ is unstable due to the existence of $\Delta$, and the stable
$\Delta$-nucleon matter is realized at about $\rho_B \sim 4\rho_0$, i.e., the
phase transition from nuclear matter to $\Delta$-nucleon matter is of first
order for small $m_{\Delta0}$, and it is of second order for large
$m_{\Delta0}$. We find that, associated with the phase transition, the chiral
condensate changes very rapidly, i.e., the chiral symmetry restoration is
accelerated by \Delta matter. As a result of the accelerations, there appear
$N^*$(1535) and $\Delta$(1700), which are the chiral partners to N(939) and
${\Delta}$(1232), in high density matter, signaling the partial chiral symmetry
restoration. Furthermore, we find that complete chiral symmetry restoration

of a free-draining polymer. The WF theory introduces a sink term into the
Fokker-Planck equation for the $3(N+1)$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
of the polymer dynamics, which accounts for the appropriate boundary condition
due to the formation of a loop. The assumption for WF theory is considerably
relaxed. A perturbation method approach is developed that justifies and
generalizes the previous results using either a Delta sink or a Heaviside sink.
For both types of sinks, we show that under the condition of a small
dimensionless $\epsilon$, the ratio of capture radius to the Kuhn length, we
are able to systematically produce all known analytical and asymptotic results
obtained by other methods. This includes most notably the transition regime
between the $N^2$ scaling of Doi, and $N\sqrt{N}/\epsilon$ scaling of Szabo,
Schulten, and Schulten. The mathematical issue at play is the non-uniform
convergence of $\epsilon\to 0$ and $N\to\infty$, the latter being an inherent
part of the theory of a Gaussian polymer. Our analysis yields a novel term in
the analytical expression for the looping time with small $\epsilon$, which is
previously unknown. Monte Carlo numerical simulations corroborate the
analytical findings. The systematic method developed here can be applied to
other systems modeled by multi-dimensional Smoluchowski equations.

as heat engine defined as a rectangle closed path in the $P-V$ plane. We get
the exact efficiency formula and find that quintessence field can improve the
heat engine efficiency which will increase as the field density $\rho_q$ grows.
At some fixed parameters, we find that bigger volume difference between the
smaller black holes($V_1$) and the bigger black holes($V_2$ ) will lead to a
lower efficiency, while the bigger pressure difference $P_1-P_4$ will make the
efficiency higher but it is always smaller than 1 and will never be beyond
Carnot efficiency which is the maximum value of the efficiency constrained by
thermodynamics laws, this is consistent to the heat engine in traditional
thermodynamics. After making some special choices for thermodynamical
quantities, we find that the increase of electric charge $Q$ and normalization
factor $a$ can also promote heat engine efficiency which would infinitely
approach the Carnot limit when $Q$ or $a$ goes to infinity.

can exploit channel state information at the transmitter and receiver. This
paper presents codebook designs and performance analyses for limited feedback
MIMO systems with finite-bit ADCs. A point-to-point single-user channel is
firstly considered. When the received signal is sliced by 1-bit ADCs, the
absolute phase at the receiver is important to align the phase of the received
signals. A new codebook design for beamforming, which separately quantizes the
channel direction and the residual phase, is therefore proposed. For the
multi-bit case where the optimal transmission method is unknown, suboptimal
Gaussian signaling and eigenvector beamforming is assumed to obtain a lower
bound of the achievable rate. It is found that to limit the rate loss, more
feedback bits are needed in the medium SNR regime than the low and high SNR
regimes, which is quite different from the conventional infinite-bit ADC case.
Second, a multi-user system where a multiple-antenna transmitter sends signals
to multiple single-antenna receivers with finite-bit ADCs is considered. Based
on the derived performance loss due to finite-bit ADCs and finite-bit CSI
feedback, the number of bits per feedback should increase linearly with the ADC
resolution in order to restrict the rate loss.

we conduct a rigorous runtime analysis of this GA on random 3-SAT instances in
the planted solution model having at least logarithmic average degree, which
are known to have a weaker fitness distance correlation.
  We prove that this GA with fixed not too large population size again obtains
runtimes better than $\Theta(n \log n)$, which is a lower bound for most
evolutionary algorithms on pseudo-Boolean problems with unique optimum.
However, the self-adjusting version of the GA risks reaching population sizes
at which the intermediate selection of the GA, due to the weaker
fitness-distance correlation, is not able to distinguish a profitable offspring
from others. We show that this problem can be overcome by equipping the
self-adjusting GA with an upper limit for the population size. Apart from
sparse instances, this limit can be chosen in a way that the asymptotic
performance does not worsen compared to the idealistic OneMax case. Overall,
this work shows that the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ GA can provably have a good

that the flaring occurs in the thin disc populations with a wide range of ages.
Moreover, the intensity of flaring seems not significantly related to the age

\{0,\ldots,u-1\}$ we want a random function $S$ mapping subsets $A\subseteq

precisely: Given sets $A,B\subseteq [u]$, define $X_i=[S(A)[i]= S(B)[i]]$ and
$X=\sum_{i\in [t]}X_i$. We want to have $E[X]=t\cdot J(A,B)$, where
$J(A,B)=|A\cap B|/|A\cup B|$ and furthermore to have strong concentration
guarantees (i.e. Chernoff-style bounds) for $X$. This is a fundamental problem
which has found numerous applications in data mining, large-scale
classification, computer vision, similarity search, etc. via the classic
MinHash algorithm. The vectors $S(A)$ are also called sketches.
  The seminal $t\times$MinHash algorithm uses $t$ random hash functions
$h_1,\ldots, h_t$, and stores $\left(\min_{a\in A}h_1(A),\ldots, \min_{a\in
A}h_t(A)\right)$ as the sketch of $A$. The main drawback of MinHash is,
however, its $O(t\cdot |A|)$ running time, and finding a sketch with similar
properties and faster running time has been the subject of several papers.
Addressing this, Li et al. [NIPS'12] introduced one permutation hashing (OPH),
which creates a sketch of size $t$ in $O(t + |A|)$ time, but with the drawback
that possibly some of the $t$ entries are ""empty"" when $|A| = O(t)$. One could
argue that sketching is not necessary in this case, however the desire in most
applications is to have one sketching procedure that works for sets of all
sizes. Therefore, filling out these empty entries is the subject of several
follow-up papers initiated by Shrivastava and Li [ICML'14]. However, these
""densification"" schemes fail to provide good concentration bounds exactly in
the case $|A| = O(t)$, where they are needed. (continued...)

remarkable speedups over Eigen's tensor transposition implementation. Most
importantly, the integration of HPTT into the Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF)
improves the overall performance of tensor contractions by up to 3.1x.

the efficient computation of predictions for the drift and diffusion terms by

live and to react to changes according to expert rules. Therefore, such systems
exploit appropriate data models together with actions, triggered by
domain-related conditions. The challenge at hand is that smart systems usually
need to process thousands of updates to detect which rules need to be
triggered, often even on restricted hardware like a Raspberry Pi. Despite
various approaches have been investigated to efficiently check conditions on
data models, they either assume to fit into main memory or rely on high latency
persistence storage systems that severely damage the reactivity of smart
systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel composition process,
which weaves executable rules into a data model with lazy loading abilities. We
quantitatively show, on a smart building case study, that our approach can
handle, at low latency, big sets of rules on top of large-scale data models on
restricted hardware.

environments, and constitutes one important element of artificial intelligence
(AI). In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that the ultrafast chaotic
oscillatory dynamics of lasers efficiently solve the multi-armed bandit problem
(MAB), which requires decision making concerning a class of difficult
trade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To solve the MAB, a
certain degree of randomness is required for exploration purposes. However,
pseudo-random numbers generated using conventional electronic circuitry
encounter severe limitations in terms of their data rate and the quality of
randomness due to their algorithmic foundations. We generate laser chaos
signals using a semiconductor laser sampled at a maximum rate of 100 GSample/s,
and combine it with a simple decision-making principle called tug-of-war with a
variable threshold, to ensure ultrafast, adaptive and accurate decision making
at a maximum adaptation speed of 1 GHz. We found that decision-making
performance was maximized with an optimal sampling interval, and we highlight
the exact coincidence between the negative autocorrelation inherent in laser
chaos and decision-making performance. This study paves the way for a new realm
of ultrafast photonics in the age of AI, where the ultrahigh bandwidth of

allocation by identifying fault-prone classes before testing phases. Several
researchers' have validated the use of different classification techniques to
develop predictive models for fault prediction. The performance of the
statistical models are proven to be influenced by the training and testing
dataset. Ensemble method learning algorithms have been widely used because it
combines the capabilities of its constituent models towards a dataset to come
up with a potentially higher performance as compared to individual models
(improves generalizability). In the study presented in this paper, three
different ensemble methods have been applied to develop a model for predicting
fault proneness. The efficacy and usefulness of a fault prediction model also
depends on the source code metrics which are considered as the input for the
model.
  In this paper, we propose a framework to validate the source code metrics and
select the right set of metrics with the objective to improve the performance
of the fault prediction model. The fault prediction models are then validated
using a cost evaluation framework. We conduct a series of experiments on 45

Majority Voting Ensemble (MVE) methods outperformed other methods; (2) selected
set of source code metrics using the suggested source code metrics using
validation framework as the input achieves better results compared to all other
metrics; (3) fault prediction method is effective for software projects with a

friction is removed from the system, has crucial impact on tribological and
materials related phenomena. By adopting an electron-phonon coupling approach
to parametrize the thermostat of the system, thus including the electronic
contribution to the thermal conductivity of iron, we can reproduce the
experimentally measured values that yield realistic temperature gradients in
the work piece. We compare these results to those obtained by assuming the two
extreme cases of only phononic heat conduction and instantaneous removal of the
heat generated in the machining interface. Our discussion of the differences
between these three cases reveals that although the average shear stress is
virtually temperature independent up to a normal pressure of approximately 1
GPa, the grain and chip morphology as well as most relevant quantities depend
heavily on the mode of thermostatting beyond a normal pressure of 0.4 GPa.
These pronounced differences can be explained by the thermally activated
processes that guide the reaction of the Fe lattice to the external mechanical
and thermal loads caused by nanomachining.

comparator networks have been proposed recently for encoding cardinality

mainly on the odd-even or pairwise comparator networks. We use similar ideas,

not only comparators (2-sorters) but more general $m$-sorters, for $m \geq 2$.
The inputs are organized into $m$ columns, in which elements are recursively
selected and, after that, columns are merged using an idea of multi-way
merging. We present two algorithms parametrized by $m \geq 2$. We call those
networks $m$-Wise Selection Network and $m$-Odd-Even Selection Network. We give
detailed construction of the mergers when $m=4$. The construction can be
directly applied to any values of $k$ and $n$. The proposed encoding of sorters
is standard, therefore the arc-consistency is preserved. We prove correctness
of the constructions and present the theoretical and experimental evaluation,

(i.e., given the same context, future may vary), 2) foreseeing the potential
future outcomes and make a strategic prediction based on that, and 3) reasoning
not only from the past motion history, but also from the scene context as well
as the interactions among the agents. DESIRE achieves these in a single
end-to-end trainable neural network model, while being computationally
efficient. The model first obtains a diverse set of hypothetical future
prediction samples employing a conditional variational autoencoder, which are
ranked and refined by the following RNN scoring-regression module. Samples are
scored by accounting for accumulated future rewards, which enables better
long-term strategic decisions similar to IOC frameworks. An RNN scene context
fusion module jointly captures past motion histories, the semantic scene
context and interactions among multiple agents. A feedback mechanism iterates
over the ranking and refinement to further boost the prediction accuracy. We
evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets: KITTI and Stanford Drone
Dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly improves

Learning all concepts together by the proposed memory rehearsal enables robot
to utilize the common structural relations among concepts which not only
expedites the learning process especially at the initial stages, but also
improves the generalization ability and the robustness against discrepancies
between observed demonstrations.
  Performance of ILoCI is assessed using standard LASA handwriting benchmark

presented for various Hermite tensor-based lattice structures. The collision
operator relies on a regularization step, which is here improved through a
recursive computation of non-equilibrium Hermite polynomial coefficients. In
addition to the reduced computational cost of this procedure with respect to
the standard one, the recursive step allows to considerably enhance the
stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme by properly filtering out second
(and higher) order non-hydrodynamic contributions in under-resolved conditions.
This is first shown in the isothermal case where the simulation of the doubly
periodic shear layer is performed with a Reynolds number ranging from $10^4$ to
$10^6$, and where a thorough analysis of the case at $Re=3\times 10^4$ is
conducted. In the latter, results obtained using both regularization steps are
compared against the BGK-LBM for standard (D2Q9) and high-order (D2V17 and
D2V37) lattice structures, confirming the tremendous increase of stability
range of the proposed approach. Further comparisons on thermal and fully
compressible flows, using the general extension of this procedure, are then
conducted through the numerical simulation of Sod shock tubes with the D2V37
lattice. They confirm the stability increase induced by the recursive approach
as compared with the standard one.

As a main guiding example we discuss the bosonic string compactified on a
circle where, at the self dual radio the generic $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge
symmetry becomes enhanced to $SU(2)\times SU(2)$. We show that the
enhancing-breaking of the gauge symmetry can be understood through a dependence
of gauge structure constants (fluxes in DFT) on moduli. This dependence, in DFT
description, is encoded in the generalized tangent frame of the double space.
Actually, the explicit T-duality invariant formulation provided by DFT proves
to be a helpful ingredient. The link with string theory results is discussed

black hole (IMBH) candidate located 8"" (3.7 Kpc) from the centre of the edge-on
S0 galaxy ESO 243-49. How the black hole came to be associated with this
galaxy, and the nature of the environment in which it resides, are still
unclear. Using multi-wavelength observations we investigate the nature of the
medium surrounding HLX-1, search for evidence of past mergers with ESO 243-49
and constrain parameters of the galaxy. Methods. We reduce and analyse integral
field unit observations of ESO 243-49 that were taken with the MUSE instrument
on the VLT. Using complementary multi-wavelength data, including X-Shooter,
HST, Swift, Chandra and ATCA data, we further examine the vicinity of HLX-1. We
additionally examine the nature of the host galaxy and estimate the mass of the
central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in ESO 243-49. Results. No evidence for
a recent minor-merger that could result in the presence of the IMBH is
discerned, but the data are compatible with a scenario in which minor mergers
may have occurred in the history of ESO 243-49. The MUSE data reveal a rapidly
rotating disc in the centre of the galaxy, around the SMBH. The mass of the
SMBH at the centre of ESO 243-49 is estimated to be 0.5-23 $\times$ 10$^7$
M$_\odot$. Studying the spectra of HLX-1, that were taken in the low/hard
state, we determine H$_\alpha$ flux variability to be at least a factor 6,
compared to observations taken during the high/soft state. This H$_\alpha$ flux
variability over one year indicates that the line originates close to the IMBH,
excluding the possibility that the line emanates from a surrounding nebula or a
star cluster. The large variability associated with the X-ray states of HLX-1
confirms that the H$_\alpha$ line is associated with the object and therefore
validates the distance to HLX-1.

content on the Internet, including web pages, videos, and software downloads. A
CDN server caches and serves the content requested by users. Designing caching
algorithms that automatically adapt to the heterogeneity, burstiness, and
non-stationary nature of real-world content requests is a major challenge and
is the focus of our work. While there is much work on caching algorithms for
stationary request traffic, the work on non-stationary request traffic is very
limited. Consequently, most prior models are inaccurate for production CDN
traffic that is non-stationary.
  We propose two TTL-based caching algorithms and provide provable guarantees
for content request traffic that is bursty and non-stationary. The first
algorithm called d-TTL dynamically adapts a TTL parameter using a stochastic
approximation approach. Given a feasible target hit rate, we show that the hit
rate of d-TTL converges to its target value for a general class of bursty
traffic that allows Markov dependence over time and non-stationary arrivals.
The second algorithm called f-TTL uses two caches, each with its own TTL. The
first-level cache adaptively filters out non-stationary traffic, while the
second-level cache stores frequently-accessed stationary traffic. Given
feasible targets for both the hit rate and the expected cache size, f-TTL
asymptotically achieves both targets. We implement d-TTL and f-TTL and evaluate
both algorithms using an extensive nine-day trace consisting of 500 million
requests from a production CDN server. We show that both d-TTL and f-TTL
converge to their hit rate targets with an error of about 1.3%. But, f-TTL
requires a significantly smaller cache size than d-TTL to achieve the same hit
rate, since it effectively filters out the non-stationary traffic for
rarely-accessed objects.

non-differentiable functions, not easily decomposable into elementary
decisions. Consequently, most approaches optimize objectives only indirectly
related to the end goal, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we
propose a differentiable relaxation that lends itself to gradient-based
optimisation, thus bypassing the need for reinforcement learning or heuristic
modification of cross-entropy. We show that by modifying the training objective
of a competitive neural coreference system, we obtain a substantial gain in
performance. This suggests that our approach can be regarded as a viable
alternative to using reinforcement learning or more computationally expensive
imitation learning.

extremely difficult, as phenotypes of tumour cells integrate hardwired
(epi)mutational differences with the dynamic responses to microenvironmental
cues. The later come in form of both direct physical interactions, as well as
inputs from gradients of secreted signalling molecules. Furthermore, tumour
cells can not only receive microenvironmental cues, but also produce them.
Despite high biological and clinical importance of understanding spatial
aspects of paracrine signaling, adequate research tools are largely lacking.
Here, a partial differential equation (PDE) based mathematical model is
developed that mimics the process of cell ablation. This model suggests how
each cell might contribute to the microenvironment by either absorbing or
secreting diffusible factors, and quantifies the extent to which observed
intensities can be explained via diffusion mediated signalling. The model
allows for the separation of phenotypic responses to signalling gradients
within tumour microenvironments from the combined influence of responses
mediated by direct physical contact and hardwired (epi)genetic differences. The
differential equation is solved around cell membrane outlines using a finite
element method (FEM). The method is applied to a multi-channel

Therefore, angular correlations with direct photons provide a mechanism to

reconstruction. Jet fragmentation modification has been measured previously in
PHENIX in central Au+Au collisions. Recent RHIC runs offer the potential to
study these observables in heavy ion collisions with greater statistics and

radically altered by the existence of a non-linear dispersion relation of

This translates in a super-linear growth of correlation fronts with time, and
sub-linear growth of relaxation times of subsystem observables with size, when
focusing on $k=0$ fluctuations. Yet the large dispersion in group velocities
leads to an extreme wavelength dependence of relaxation times of finite-$k$

been analyzed by using the random matrix theory and complex network. The
correlation structures of the fluctuations at different magnitudes have unique
properties. The cross-correlations among small fluctuations are much stronger
than those among large fluctuations. The large and small fluctuations are
dominated by different groups of stocks. We use complex network representation
to study these q-dependent matrices and discover some new identities. By
utilizing those q-dependent correlation-based networks, we are able to
construct some portfolio by those most independent stocks which consistently
perform the best. The optimal multifractal order for portfolio optimization is
approximately $q=2$. These results have deepened our understanding about the
collective behaviors of the complex financial system.

beyond), millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication with large available unlicensed
spectrum is a promising technology that enables gigabit multimedia
applications. Thanks to the short wavelength of mmWave radio, massive antenna
arrays can be packed into the limited dimensions of mmWave transceivers.
Therefore, with directional beamforming (BF), both mmWave transmitters (MTXs)
and mmWave receivers (MRXs) are capable of supporting multiple beams in 5G
networks. However, for the transmission between an MTX and an MRX, most works
have only considered a single beam, which means that they do not make full
potential use of mmWave. Furthermore, the connectivity of single beam
transmission can easily be blocked. In this context, we propose a single-user
multi-beam concurrent transmission scheme for future mmWave networks with
multiple reflected paths. Based on spatial spectrum reuse, the scheme can be
described as a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique in beamspace
(i.e., in the beam-number domain). Moreover, this study investigates the
challenges and potential solutions for implementing this scheme, including
multibeam selection, cooperative beam tracking, multi-beam power allocation and
synchronization. The theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed
beamspace SU-MIMO can largely improve the achievable rate of the transmission
between an MTX and an MRX and, meanwhile, can maintain the connectivity.
