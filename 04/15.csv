decision processes, where the goal is to evaluate a policy in a model-free way
by using observations of a state process generated without executing the
policy. To curb the high variance issue in off-policy TD learning, we propose a
new scheme of setting the $\lambda$-parameters of TD, based on generalized
Bellman equations. Our scheme is to set $\lambda$ according to the eligibility
trace iterates calculated in TD, thereby easily keeping these traces in a
desired bounded range. Compared with prior work, this scheme is more direct and
flexible, and allows much larger $\lambda$ values for off-policy TD learning
with bounded traces. As to its soundness, using Markov chain theory, we prove
the ergodicity of the joint state-trace process under nonrestrictive
conditions, and we show that associated with our scheme is a generalized
Bellman equation (for the policy to be evaluated) that depends on both the
evolution of $\lambda$ and the unique invariant probability measure of the
state-trace process. These results not only lead immediately to a
characterization of the convergence behavior of least-squares based
implementation of our scheme, but also prepare the ground for further analysis
of gradient-based implementations.

using the device for a limited amount of time. In general, energy attacks on
mobile devices are denial of service (DoS) type of attacks. While previous
studies have analyzed the energy attacks in servers, no existing work has
analyzed the energy attacks on mobile devices. As such, in this paper, we
present the first systematic study on how to exploit the energy attacks on
smartphones. In particular, we explore energy attacks from the following
aspect: hardware components, software resources, and network communications
through the design and implementation of concrete malicious apps, and malicious
web pages. We quantitatively show how quickly we can drain the battery through
each individual attack, as well as their combinations. Finally, we believe
energy exploit will be a practical attack vector and mobile users should be
aware of this type of attacks.

equipped with a cache that can store a limited number of files. The popularity
of the files is known and the goal is to place files in the caches such that
the probability that a user at an arbitrary location in the plane will find the
file that she requires in one of the covering caches is maximized.
  We develop distributed asynchronous algorithms for deciding which contents to
store in which cache. Such cooperative algorithms require communication only
between caches with overlapping coverage areas and can operate in asynchronous
manner. The development of the algorithms is principally based on an
observation that the problem can be viewed as a potential game. Our basic
algorithm is derived from the best response dynamics. We demonstrate that the
complexity of each best response step is independent of the number of files,
linear in the cache capacity and linear in the maximum number of base stations
that cover a certain area. Then, we show that the overall algorithm complexity
for a discrete cache placement is polynomial in both network size and catalog
size. In practical examples, the algorithm converges in just a few iterations.
Also, in most cases of interest, the basic algorithm finds the best Nash
equilibrium corresponding to the global optimum. We provide two extensions of
our basic algorithm based on stochastic and deterministic simulated annealing
which find the global optimum.
  Finally, we demonstrate the hit probability evolution on real and synthetic
networks numerically and show that our distributed caching algorithm performs
significantly better than storing the most popular content, probabilistic
content placement policy and Multi-LRU caching policies.

We propose a photon collider design, where the photons are generated by
undulator radiation from high energy muon beams. This reduces the energy
requirements by a factor of more than $10^7$ compared to a pp collider. Much of
the reduction in energy use is achieved by using a periodic magnetic field, and
by splitting the muon wavefunctions spatially to reduce the photon beam
divergence; these prevent a cascade of secondary reactions at the collision

reduce the time needed to reach the desired number of collisions. We also

i.e., neighbors in a social network. Presumably, being privy to the experiences
of others aids in learning and decision making, but how much advantage does an
individual gain by observing her neighbors? Such problems make appearances in
sociology and economics and, in this paper, we present a novel model to capture
such decision-making processes and appeal to the classical multi-armed bandit
framework to analyze it. Each individual, in addition to her own actions, can
observe the actions and rewards obtained by her neighbors, and can use all of
this information in order to minimize her own regret. We provide algorithms for
this setting, both for stochastic and adversarial bandits, and show that their
regret smoothly interpolates between the regret in the classical bandit setting
and that of the full-information setting as a function of the neighbors'
exploration. In the stochastic setting the additional information must simply
be incorporated into the usual estimation of the rewards, while in the
adversarial setting this is attained by constructing a new unbiased estimator
for the rewards and appropriately bounding the amount of additional information
provided by the neighbors. These algorithms are optimal up to log factors;
despite the fact that the agents act independently and selfishly, this implies
that it is an approximate Nash equilibria for all agents to use our algorithms.
Further, we show via empirical simulations that our algorithms, often
significantly, outperform existing algorithms that one could apply to this

trees, and other objects. To do this, many fundamental concepts for
multivariate random variables (e.g., marginal variables, Gibbs distribution,
Markov properties) must be extended to other mathematical objects; it turns out
that this extension is possible, as we will discuss, if we have a consistent,
complete system of projections on a given object. Each projection defines a
marginal random variable, allowing one to specify independence assumptions
between them. Furthermore, these independencies can be specified in terms of a
small subset of these marginal variables (which we call the atomic variables),
allowing the compact representation of independencies by a directed graph.
Projections also define factors, functions on the projected object space, and
hence a projection family defines a set of possible factorizations for a
distribution; these can be compactly represented by an undirected graph.
  The invariances used in graphical models are essential for learning
distributions, not just on multivariate random variables, but also on other
objects. When they are applied to random graphs and random trees, the result is
a general class of models that is applicable to a broad range of problems,
including those in which the graphs and trees have complicated edge structures.
These models need not be conditioned on a fixed number of vertices, as is often
the case in the literature for random graphs, and can be used for problems in
which attributes are associated with vertices and edges. For graphs,
applications include the modeling of molecules, neural networks, and relational
real-world scenes; for trees, applications include the modeling of infectious
diseases, cell fusion, the structure of language, and the structure of objects
in visual scenes. Many classic models are particular instances of this
framework.

This involves estimation of multiple output variables (facial action units ---
AUs) that are structurally dependent. Their structure arises from statistically
induced co-occurrence patterns of AU intensity levels. Modeling this structure
is critical for improving the estimation performance; however, this performance
is bounded by the quality of the input features extracted from face images. The
goal of this paper is to model these structures and estimate complex feature
representations simultaneously by combining conditional random field (CRF)
encoded AU dependencies with deep learning. To this end, we propose a novel
Copula CNN deep learning approach for modeling multivariate ordinal variables.
Our model accounts for $ordinal$ structure in output variables and their
$non$-$linear$ dependencies via copula functions modeled as cliques of a CRF.
These are jointly optimized with deep CNN feature encoding layers using a newly
introduced balanced batch iterative training algorithm. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on the task of AU intensity estimation on two
benchmark datasets. We show that joint learning of the deep features and the
target output structure results in significant performance gains compared to
existing deep structured models for analysis of facial expressions.

questions: if we cannot efficiently compute predictions for the behavior of
quantum systems, how can we test their behavior? In other words, is quantum
mechanics falsifiable? In cryptographic settings, how can a customer of a
future untrusted quantum computing company be convinced of the correctness of
its quantum computations? To provide answers to these questions, we define
Quantum Prover Interactive Proofs (QPIP). Whereas in standard interactive
proofs the prover is computationally unbounded, here our prover is in BQP,
representing a quantum computer. The verifier models our current computational
capabilities: it is a BPP machine, with access to only a few qubits. Our main
theorem states, roughly: 'Any language in BQP has a QPIP, which also hides the
computation from the prover'. We provide two proofs, one based on a quantum
authentication scheme (QAS) relying on random Clifford rotations and the other
based on a QAS which uses polynomial codes (BOCG+ 06), combined with secure
multiparty computation methods.
  This is the journal version of work reported in 2008 (ABOE08) and presented
in ICS 2010; here we have completed the details and made the proofs rigorous.
Some of the proofs required major modifications and corrections. Notably, the
claim that the polynomial QPIP is fault tolerant was removed. Similar results
(with different protocols) were reported independently around the same time of
the original version in BFK08. The initial independent works (ABOE08, BFK08)
ignited a long line of research of blind verifiable quantum computation, which
we survey here, along with connections to various cryptographic problems.
Importantly, the problems of making the results fault tolerant as well as
removing the need for quantum communication altogether remain open.

study quantum localization. It has been universally believed that the
tight-binding version of this bichromatic incommensurate system is represented
by the well-known Aubry-Andre model. Here we establish that this belief is
incorrect and that the Aubry-Andre model description, which applies only in the
extreme tight-binding limit of very deep primary lattice potential, generically
breaks down near the localization transition due to the unavoidable appearance
of single-particle mobility edges (SPME). In fact, we show that the 1D
bichromatic incommensurate potential system manifests generic mobility edges
which disappear in the tight-binding limit, leading to the well-studied
Aubry-Andre physics. We carry out an extensive study of the localization
properties of the 1D incommensurate optical lattice without making any
tight-binding approximation. We find that, for the full lattice system, an
intermediate phase between completely localized and completely delocalized
regions appears due to the existence of the SPME, making the system
qualitatively distinct from the Aubry-Andre prediction. Using the Wegner flow
approach, we show that the SPME in the real lattice system can be attributed to
significant corrections of higher-order harmonics in the lattice potential
which are absent in the strict tight-binding limit. We calculate the dynamical
consequences of the intermediate phase in detail to guide future experimental
investigations for the observation of 1D SPME and the associated intermediate
phase. We consider effects of interaction numerically, and conjecture the
stability of SPME to weak interaction effects, thus leading to the exciting
possibility of an experimentally viable nonergodic extended phase in
interacting 1D optical lattices.

consider detailed sky simulations based on state-of-the-art CMB observations
that consist of CMB polarization with $\tau=0.055$ and tensor-to-scalar values
ranging from $r=10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$, Galactic synchrotron, and thermal dust
polarization with variable spectral indices over the sky, polarized anomalous
microwave emission, polarized infrared and radio sources, and gravitational
lensing effects. Using both parametric and blind approaches, we perform full
component separation and likelihood analysis of the simulations, allowing us to
quantify both uncertainties and biases on the reconstructed primordial
$B$-modes. Under the assumption of perfect control of lensing effects, CORE
would measure an unbiased estimate of $r=\left(5 \pm 0.4\right)\times 10^{-3}$
after foreground cleaning. In the presence of both gravitational lensing
effects and astrophysical foregrounds, the significance of the detection is
lowered, with CORE achieving a $4\sigma$-measurement of $r=5\times 10^{-3}$
after foreground cleaning and $60$% delensing. For lower tensor-to-scalar
ratios ($r=10^{-3}$) the overall uncertainty on $r$ is dominated by foreground
residuals, not by the 40% residual of lensing cosmic variance. Moreover, the
residual contribution of unprocessed polarized point-sources can be the
dominant foreground contamination to primordial B-modes at this $r$ level, even
on relatively large angular scales, $\ell \sim 50$. Finally, we report two
sources of potential bias for the detection of the primordial
$B$-modes.[abridged]

marginally unstable to collapse. Our simulations model the direct collapse of
supermassive stars (SMSs) to seed black holes (BHs) that can grow to become the
supermassive BHs at the centers of quasars and AGNs. They also crudely model
the collapse of massive Pop III stars to BHs, which could power a fraction of
distant, long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The initial stellar models we adopt are
$\Gamma = 4/3$ polytropes seeded with a dynamically unimportant dipole magnetic
field (B field). We treat initial B-field configurations either confined to the
stellar interior or extending out from the interior into the stellar exterior.
The BH formed following collapse has mass $M_{BH} \simeq 0.9M$ (where $M$ is
the mass of the initial star) and spin $a_{BH}/M_{BH}\simeq 0.7$. A massive,
hot, magnetized torus surrounds the remnant BH. At $\Delta t\sim
400-550M\approx 2000-2700(M/10^6M_\odot)$s following the gravitational wave
(GW) peak amplitude, an incipient jet is launched. The disk lifetime is $\Delta
t\sim 10^5(M/10^6M_\odot)$s, and the jet luminosity is $L_{EM}\sim 10^{51-52}$
ergs/s. If $\gtrsim 1-10\%$ of this power is converted into gamma rays, SWIFT
and FERMI could potentially detect these events out to large redshifts $z\sim
20$. Thus, SMSs could be sources of ultra-long GRBs and massive Pop III stars
could be the progenitors that power a fraction of the long GRBs observed at
redshift $z \sim 5-8$. GWs are copiously emitted during the collapse, and peak
at $\sim 15(10^6 M_{\odot}/M)\rm mHz$ ($\sim 0.15(10^4 M_{\odot}/M)\rm Hz$),
i.e., in the LISA (DECIGO/BBO) band; optimally oriented SMSs could be
detectable by LISA (DECIGO/BBO) at $z \lesssim 3$ ($z \lesssim 11$). Hence
$10^4 M_{\odot}$ SMSs collapsing at $z\sim 10$ are promising multimessenger
sources of coincident gravitational and electromagnetic waves.

First, it sorts all detection boxes on the basis of their scores. The detection
box M with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a
significant overlap (using a pre-defined threshold) with M are suppressed. This
process is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the
algorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leads
to a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-NMS, an algorithm which decays the
detection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap
with M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-NMS obtains
consistent improvements for the coco-style mAP metric on standard datasets like
PASCAL VOC 2007 (1.7% for both R-FCN and Faster-RCNN) and MS-COCO (1.3% for
R-FCN and 1.1% for Faster-RCNN) by just changing the NMS algorithm without any
additional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-RFCN, Soft-NMS improves
state-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8% to 40.9% with a single model.
Further, the computational complexity of Soft-NMS is the same as traditional
NMS and hence it can be efficiently implemented. Since Soft-NMS does not
require any extra training and is simple to implement, it can be easily
integrated into any object detection pipeline. Code for Soft-NMS is publicly
available on GitHub (http://bit.ly/2nJLNMu).

optical switching, low noise amplification, and harmonic frequency generation.
However, the nonlinear processes usually have an extremely weak nature and
require high input power to be excited. To alleviate this severe limitation, we
propose new designs of ultrathin nonlinear metasurfaces composed of patterned
graphene micro-ribbons to significantly enhance third harmonic generation (THG)
at far-infrared and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The incident wave is tightly
confined and significantly boosted along the surface of graphene in these
configurations due to the excitation of highly localized plasmons. The
bandwidth of the resonant response becomes narrower due to the introduction of
a metallic substrate below the graphene micro-ribbons, which leads to zero
transmission and standing waves inside the intermediate dielectric spacer
layer. The enhancement of the incident field, combined with the large nonlinear
conductivity of graphene, can dramatically increase the THG conversion
efficiency by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the resonant frequency
of the metasurface can be adjusted by dynamically tuning the Fermi energy of
graphene via electrical or chemical doping. As a result, the third harmonic
generated wave can be optimized and tuned to be emitted at different
frequencies without the need to change the nonlinear metasurface geometry. The
proposed nonlinear metasurfaces provide a new way to realize compact and
efficient nonlinear sources at the far-infrared and THz frequency ranges, as
well as new frequency generation and wave mixing devices which are expected to
be useful for nonlinear THz spectroscopy and noninvasive THz imaging
applications.

confirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different $P_{rot}$
distributions. We also compare the observed $P_{rot}$ distribution in Praesepe

the clear bimodal $P_{rot}$ distribution predicted by Brown (2014) for $>$0.5

elegant way of analyzing a randomized algorithm. It applies to incremental
algorithms where elements are added incrementally, following some random
permutation, e.g., incremental Delauney triangulation of a pointset, where
points are added one by one, and where we always maintain the Delauney
triangulation of the points added thus far. For backwards analysis, we think of
the permutation as generated backwards, implying that the $i$th point in the
permutation is picked uniformly at random from the $i$ points not picked yet in
the backwards direction. Backwards analysis has also been applied elegantly by
Chan to the randomized linear time minimum spanning tree algorithm of Karger,
Klein, and Tarjan.
  The question considered in this paper is how much randomness we need in order
to trust the expected bounds obtained using backwards analysis, exactly and
approximately. For the exact case, it turns out that a random permutation works
if and only if it is minwise, that is, for any given subset, each element has
the same chance of being first. Minwise permutations are known to have
$\Theta(n)$ entropy, and this is then also what we need for exact backwards
analysis.
  However, when it comes to approximation, the two concepts diverge
dramatically. To get backwards analysis to hold within a factor $\alpha$, the
random permutation needs entropy $\Omega(n/\alpha)$. This contrasts with
minwise permutations, where it is known that a $1+\varepsilon$ approximation
only needs $\Theta(\log (n/\varepsilon))$ entropy. Our negative result for
backwards analysis essentially shows that it is as abstract as any analysis
based on full randomness.

developed and demonstrated to enable extension of slow growth modeling concepts
to complex boundary layer flows. As in previous slow growth approaches, the
formulation assumes scale separation between the fast scales of turbulence and
the slow evolution of statistics such as the mean flow. This separation enables
the development of approaches where the fast scales of turbulence are directly
simulated while the forcing provided by the slow evolution is modeled. The
resulting model admits periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise
direction, which avoids the need for extremely long domains and complex inflow
conditions that typically accompany spatially developing simulations. Further,
it enables the use of efficient Fourier numerics. Unlike previous approaches,
the present approach is based on a temporally evolving boundary layer and is
specifically tailored to give results for calibration and validation of RANS
turbulence models. The use of a temporal homogenization simplifies the
modeling, enabling straightforward extension to flows with complicating
features, including cold and blowing walls. To generate data useful for
calibration and validation of RANS models, special care is taken to ensure that
the mean slow growth forcing is closed in terms of the mean and other
quantities that appear in standard RANS models, ensuring that there is no
confounding between typical RANS closures and additional closures required for
the slow growth problem. The performance of the method is demonstrated on two
problems: an essentially incompressible, zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer
and a transonic boundary layer over a cooled wall with wall transpiration.

wormlike micellar solution studied in this work contains cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal). This system can be shear banding
and highly elastic, non-shear banding and moderately elastic, or nearly
Newtonian as the temperature is varied over a narrow range. The effect of
elasticity on transitions and instabilities is probed by changing the
temperature over a wide range of elasticity (El<< 1, El ~1, and El>>1).
Elasticity is defined as the ratio of the Weissenberg number to the Reynolds
number. For shear banding wormlike micelle solutions where El>> 1, a primary
transition from the base Couette flow to stationary vortices that are evenly
spaced in the axial direction of the shear cell and are characterized by an
asymptotic wave-length is observed. The dimensionless wave- length at the onset
of this shear banding transition for CTAB/NaSal system turns out to be much
larger than those reported for other shear banding wormlike micelle systems.
For the same fluid at a temperature where it shear-thins but does not display
shear banding, El~1, and for slow ramp speeds, the primary transition is to
distinct structures that are not stationary but rather travel in the axial
direction. At low elasticity (El<< 1), where the fluid behaves as a nearly
Newtonian fluid, several transitions from purely azimuthal Couette flow to
modified Taylor vortex flows and finally chaotic regimes are documented. The
behavior in the shear-banding and non-shear-banding regimes are discussed and

  text overlap with arXiv:1703.06839",,,,"math.FA math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  J. Kigami has laid the foundations of what is now known as analysis on
fractals, by allowing the construction of an operator of the same nature of the
Laplacian, defined locally, on graphs having a fractal character. The
Sierpinski gasket stands out of the best known example. It has, since then,
been taken up, developed and popularized by R. S. Strichartz.
  The Laplacian is obtained through a weak formulation, obtained by means of
Dirichlet forms, built by induction on a sequence of graphs that converges
towards the considered domain. It is these Dirichlet forms that enable one to
obtain energy forms on this domain.
  Yet, things are not that simple. If, for domains like the Sierpinski gasket,
the Laplacian is obtained in a quite natural way, one must bear in mind that
Dirichlet forms solely depend on the topology of the domain, and not of its
geometry. Which means that, if one aims at building a Laplacian on a fractal
domain, the topology of which is the same as, for instance, a line segment, one
has to find a way of taking account a very specific geometry. We came across
that problem in our work on the graph of the Weierstrass function The solution
was thus to consider energy forms more sophisticated than classical ones, by
means of normalization constants that could, not only bear the topology, but,
also, the very specific geometry of, from now on, we will call W-curves.
  We presently aim at investigating the links between energy forms and
geometry. We have chosen to consider fractal curves, specifically, the
Sierpi\'nski arrowhead curve, the limit of which is the Sierpi\'nski gasket.
Does one obtain the same Laplacian as for the triangle ? The question appears
as worth to be investigated.

direct CP asymmetries each, using the sum rule correlating $D^0\to K^+K^-$,
$D^0\to \pi^+ \pi^-$, and $D^0\to \pi^0 \pi^0$ for illustration. The other sum
rule involves $a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}}(D^+\rightarrow \bar{K}^0K^+)$,
$a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}}(D_s^+\rightarrow K^0\pi^+)$, and
$a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}}(D_s^+\to K^+ \pi^0)$. The second topic is the direct CP
asymmetry in the decay $D^0 \to K_S K_S$, which is expected to be large in the
Standard Model for two reasons: Flavor-SU(3) symmetry suppresses the tree
amplitude which enhances the crucial ""penguin-to-tree"" ratio and the ""penguin""
amplitude is dominated by the tree-level $W$ boson exchange between $c$ and $u$
quarks. We find that $|a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}} (D^0 \to K_S K_S)|$ can be as
large as $1.1 \%$ in the Standard Model. We advocate $D^0 \to K_S K_S$ as a
discovery channel for charm CP violation.

system, and properly identifying the energy terms for each component and,
especially, their coupling. To illustrate the proposed approach, we work with
the bi-dimensional spring pendulum, which is a paradigm to study nonlinear
coupled systems, and is used as a model for several systems. For the spring
pendulum, we identify three energy components, resembling the spring and
pendulum like motions, and the coupling between them. With these analytical
expressions, we analyze the energy exchange for individual trajectories, and we
also obtain global characteristics of the spring pendulum energy distribution
by calculating spatial and time average energy components for a great number of
trajectories (periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic) throughout the phase space.
Considering an energy term due to the nonlinear coupling, we identify regions
in the parameter space that correspond to strong and weak coupling. The
presented procedure can be applied to nonlinear coupled systems to reveal how
the coupling mediates internal energy exchanges, and how the energy
distribution varies according to the system parameters.

approach for mitigating the uncertainties in renewable energy integration by
taking advantage of the flexibility of customers' demands. However, existing DR
programs suffer from either low participation due to strict commitment
requirements or not being reliable in voluntary programs. In addition, the
capacity planning for energy storage/reserves is traditionally done separately
from the demand response program design, which incurs inefficiencies. Moreover,
customers often face high uncertainties in their costs in providing demand
response, which is not well studied in literature.
  This paper first models the problem of joint capacity planning and demand
response program design by a stochastic optimization problem, which
incorporates the uncertainties from renewable energy generation, customer power
demands, as well as the customers' costs in providing DR. We propose online DR
control policies based on the optimal structures of the offline solution. A
distributed algorithm is then developed for implementing the control policies
without efficiency loss. We further offer enhanced policy design by allowing
flexibilities into the commitment level. We perform real world trace based
numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can
achieve near optimal social costs, and significant social cost savings compared

  http://smarttransport.ucd.ie/wordpress/spotlight-projects/",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Pollution in urban centres is becoming a major societal problem. While
pollution is a concern for all urban dwellers, cyclists are one of the most
exposed groups due to their proximity to vehicle tailpipes. Consequently, new
solutions are required to help protect citizens, especially cyclists, from the
harmful effects of exhaust-gas emissions. In this context, hybrid vehicles
(HVs) offer new actuation possibilities that can be exploited in this
direction. More specifically, such vehicles when working together as a group,
have the ability to dynamically lower the emissions in a given area, thus
benefiting citizens, whilst still giving the vehicle owner the flexibility of
using an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). This paper aims to develop an
algorithm, that can be deployed in such vehicles, whereby geofences (virtual
geographic boundaries) are used to specify areas of low pollution around
cyclists. The emissions level inside the geofence is controlled via a coin
tossing algorithm to switch the HV motor into, and out of, electric mode, in a
manner that is in some sense optimal. The optimality criterion is based on how
polluting vehicles inside the geofence are, and the expected density of
cyclists near each vehicle. The algorithm is triggered once a vehicle detects a
cyclist. Implementations are presented, both in simulation, and in a real
vehicle, and the system is tested using a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform
(video provided).

significantly improved our understanding of public cooperation in structured
populations. Multiplex networks, in particular, provide the theoretical
framework within network science that allows us to mathematically describe the
rich structure of interactions characterizing human societies. While research
has shown that multiplex networks may enhance the resilience of cooperation,
the interplay between the overlap in the structure of the layers and the
control parameters of the corresponding games has not yet been investigated.
With this aim, we consider here the public goods game on a multiplex network,
and we unveil the role of the number of layers and the overlap of links, as
well as the impact of different synergy factors in different layers, on the
onset of cooperation. We show that enhanced public cooperation emerges only
when a significant edge overlap is combined with at least one layer being able
to sustain some cooperation by means of a sufficiently high synergy factor. In
the absence of either of these conditions, the evolution of cooperation in
multiplex networks is determined by the bounds of traditional network
reciprocity with no enhanced resilience. These results caution against overly
optimistic predictions that the presence of multiple social domains may in
itself promote cooperation, and they help us better understand the complexity
behind prosocial behavior in layered social systems.

with assumption on the index category or on the type theory. Further, we
present a construction of diagrams over certain Reedy categories. As an
application, we add the degeneracies to the well-known construction of
semisimplicial types, yielding a construction of simplicial types up to any

computer science, and conjectures about their hardness are among the
cornerstones of fine-grained complexity. One of the most intriguing open
problems in this area is to base the hardness of one of these problems on the
other.
  Our main result is a tight reduction from k-SAT to Subset-Sum on dense
instances, proving that Bellman's 1962 pseudo-polynomial $O^{*}(T)$-time
algorithm for Subset-Sum on $n$ numbers and target $T$ cannot be improved to
time $T^{1-\varepsilon}\cdot 2^{o(n)}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, unless the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails. This is one of the strongest
known connections between any two of the core problems of fine-grained
complexity.
  As a corollary, we prove a ""Direct-OR"" theorem for Subset-Sum under SETH,
offering a new tool for proving conditional lower bounds: It is now possible to
assume that deciding whether one out of $N$ given instances of Subset-Sum is a
YES instance requires time $(N T)^{1-o(1)}$. As an application of this
corollary, we prove a tight SETH-based lower bound for the classical Bicriteria
s,t-Path problem, which is extensively studied in Operations Research. We
separate its complexity from that of Subset-Sum: On graphs with $m$ edges and
edge lengths bounded by $L$, we show that the $O(Lm)$ pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm by Joksch from 1966 cannot be improved to $\tilde{O}(L+m)$, in
contrast to a recent improvement for Subset Sum (Bringmann, SODA 2017).

products of several small, one-dimensional matrices. Traditional matrix-based
preconditioners require $\mathcal{O}(p^{2d})$ storage and $\mathcal{O}(p^{3d})$
computational work, where $p$ is the degree of basis polynomials used, and $d$
is the spatial dimension. Our SVD-based tensor-product preconditioner requires
$\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$ storage, $\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$ work in two spatial

Combined with a matrix-free Newton-Krylov solver, these preconditioners allow
for the solution of DG systems in linear time in $p$ per degree of freedom in
2D, and reduce the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(p^9)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ in 3D. Numerical results are shown in 2D and 3D for the
advection and Euler equations, using polynomials of degree up to $p=15$. For
many test cases, the preconditioner results in similar iteration counts when

significantly improved for high polynomial degrees $p$.

stellar-mass Galactic BHs 4U~1543--47 and GX~339--4 as reference sources. The
Gamma-Mdot correlation revealed in BL Lac is similar to those in a number of

identifying all arms whose expected rewards are above a predefined threshold

recently. Although the proposed algorithm in Locatelli et al. [2016] achieves
the optimal round complexity in a certain sense, there still remain unsolved
issues. This paper proposes an asynchronous parallel thresholding algorithm and
its parameter-free version to improve the efficiency and the applicability. On
one hand, the proposed two algorithms use the empirical variance to guide the
pull decision at each round, and significantly improve the round complexity of
the ""optimal"" algorithm when all arms have bounded high order moments. The
proposed algorithms can be proven to be optimal. On the other hand, most bandit
algorithms assume that the reward can be observed immediately after the pull or
the next decision would not be made before all rewards are observed. Our
proposed asynchronous parallel algorithms allow making the choice of the next
pull with unobserved rewards from earlier pulls, which avoids such an
unrealistic assumption and significantly improves the identification process.
Our theoretical analysis justifies the effectiveness and the efficiency of
proposed asynchronous parallel algorithms.

parameterized stochastic optimization problem. In deterministic regimes,
best-response schemes have been shown to be convergent under a suitable

direct application of this scheme to stochastic settings requires obtaining
exact solutions to stochastic optimization at each iteration. Instead, we
propose an inexact generalization in which an inexact solution is computed via
an increasing number of projected stochastic gradient steps. Based on this
framework, we present three inexact best-response schemes: (i) First, we
propose a synchronous scheme where all players simultaneously update their
strategies; (ii) Subsequently, we extend this to a randomized setting where a
subset of players is randomly chosen to their update strategies while the
others keep their strategies invariant; (iii) Finally, we propose an

the overall iteration complexity in terms of projected stochastic gradient

iteration complexity is ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^{2(1+c) + \delta})$ where $c = 0$
in the context of (i) and represents the positive cost of randomization (in
(ii)) and asynchronicity and delay (in (iii)). The schemes are further extended
to linear and quadratic recourse-based stochastic Nash games.

plentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and
implementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to
enhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be
used to engineer social harm - that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or

Mathematically speaking, it maximizes a polynomial objective function, subject
to assignment constraints. In this paper, we reformulate the hypergraph
matching problem as a sparse constrained tensor optimization problem. The
optimality conditions are characterized based on the sparse constrained
optimization theory. By dropping the sparsity constraint, we show that the
resulting relaxation problem can recover the global minimizer of the original
problem. The critical step in solving the original problem is to identify the
location of nonzero entries (referred as support set) in a global minimizer.
Inspired by such observations, we penalize the equality constraints and apply
the quadratic penalty method to solve the relaxation problem. Under reasonable
assumptions, we show that the support set of the global minimizer in hypergraph
matching problem can be correctly identified when the number of iterations is
sufficiently large. A projected gradient method is applied as a subsolver to
solve the quadratic penalty subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that the
exact recovery of support set indeed happens, and the proposed algorithms are

to challenges in energy harvesting (EH) systems, in which nodes scavenge energy
from their environment. An EH receiver must harvest enough energy for
demodulating and decoding. The energy required depends upon factors, like code
rate and signal-to-noise ratio, which can be adjusted dynamically. We consider
a receiver which harvests energy from ambient sources and the transmitter,
meaning the received signal is used for both EH and information decoding.
Assuming a generalized function for energy consumption, we maximize the total
number of information bits decoded, under both average and peak power
constraints at the transmitter, by carefully optimizing the power used for EH,
power used for information transmission, fraction of time for EH, and code
rate. For transmission over a single block, we find there exist problem
parameters for which either maximizing power for information transmission or
maximizing power for EH is optimal. In the general case, the optimal solution
is a tradeoff of the two. For transmission over multiple blocks, we give an
upper bound on performance and give sufficient and necessary conditions to
achieve this bound. Finally, we give some numerical results to illustrate our

devices can provide a powerful platform for local mobile cloud computing. The
vision can be realized by peer-to-peer cooperative computing between edge
devices, referred to as co-computing. This paper considers a co-computing
system where a user offloads computation of input-data to a helper. The helper
controls the offloading process for the objective of minimizing the user's
energy consumption based on a predicted helper's CPU-idling profile that
specifies the amount of available computation resource for co-computing.
Consider the scenario that the user has one-shot input-data arrival and the
helper buffers offloaded bits. The problem for energy-efficient co-computing is
formulated as two sub-problems: the slave problem corresponding to adaptive
offloading and the master one to data partitioning. Given a fixed offloaded
data size, the adaptive offloading aims at minimizing the energy consumption
for offloading by controlling the offloading rate under the deadline and buffer
constraints. By deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
optimal solution, we characterize the structure of the optimal policies and
propose algorithms for computing the policies. Furthermore, we show that the
problem of optimal data partitioning for offloading and local computing at the
user is convex, admitting a simple solution using the sub-gradient method.
Last, the developed design approach for co-computing is extended to the
scenario of bursty data arrivals at the user accounting for data causality
constraints. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms.

the proposed scheme to compare with another algorithms. With dense datasets,
which have a large average length of transactions, HPrepost is more effective
than frequent itemsets algorithms in terms of execution time and memory usage
for all min-sup. Generally, our algorithm outperforms algorithms in terms of
runtime and memory usage with small thresholds and large datasets.

The input matrix is constrained in the sense that the set of states that each

it. Our goal is to optimally select an input set from the set of inputs given
that the system is controllable. These problems are known to be NP-hard.
Firstly, we give a new necessary and sufficient graph theoretic condition for
checking structural controllability using flow networks. Using this condition
we give a polynomial reduction of both these problems to a known NP-hard
problem, the minimum cost fixed flow problem (MCFF). Subsequently, we prove
that an optimal solution to the MCFF problem corresponds to an optimal solution
to the original controllability problem. We also show that approximation
schemes of MCFF directly applies to minimum cost constrained input selection
problems. Using the special structure of the flow network constructed for the
structured system, we give a polynomial approximation algorithm based on
minimum weight bipartite matching and a greedy selection scheme for solving
MCFF on system flow network. The proposed algorithm gives a

machine learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images. The
algorithm uses the superpixel representation of the reference color images to
learn the relationship between different image features and their corresponding
color values. We use this learned information to predict the color value of
each grayscale image superpixel. As compared to processing individual image
pixels, our use of superpixels helps us to achieve a much higher degree of
spatial consistency as well as speeds up the colorization process. The
predicted color values of the gray-scale image superpixels are used to provide
a 'micro-scribble' at the centroid of the superpixels. These color scribbles
are refined by using a voting based approach. To generate the final
colorization result, we use an optimization-based approach to smoothly spread
the color scribble across all pixels within a superpixel. Experimental results
on a broad range of images and the comparison with existing state-of-the-art
colorization methods demonstrate the greater effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

short patterns over a long text is widely accelerated by various compressed
full-text indexes. These indexes are able to provide similar searching
functionalities to classical indexes, e.g., suffix trees and suffix arrays,
while requiring less space. For genomic data, a well-known family of compressed
full-text index, called FM-indexes, presents unmatched performance in practice.
One major drawback of FM-indexes is that their locating operations, which
report all occurrence positions of patterns in a given text, are particularly
slow, especially for the patterns with many occurrences.
  Results: In this paper, we introduce a novel locating algorithm, FMtree, to
fast retrieve all occurrence positions of any pattern via FM-indexes. When
searching for a pattern over a given text, FMtree organizes the search space of
the locating operation into a conceptual quadtree. As a result, multiple
occurrence positions of this pattern can be retrieved simultaneously by
traversing the quadtree. Compared with the existing locating algorithms, our
tree-based algorithm reduces large numbers of redundant operations and presents
better data locality. Experimental results show that FMtree is usually one
order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, and still
memory-efficient.

modulation, we show that the use of differential coding does not decrease the
total amount of reliably conveyable information over the channel. It is a
common misconception that the use of differential coding introduces an
unavoidable differential loss. This perceived differential loss is rather a
consequence of simplified differential detection and decoding at the receiver.
Afterwards, we show how capacity-approaching coding schemes based on LDPC and
spatially coupled LDPC codes can be constructed by combining iterative
demodulation and decoding. For this, we first show how to modify the
differential decoder to account for phase slips and then how to use this
modified differential decoder to construct good LDPC codes. This construction
method can serve as a blueprint to construct good and practical LDPC codes for
other applications with iterative detection, such as higher order modulation
formats with non-square constellations, multi-dimensional optimized modulation
formats, turbo equalization to mitigate ISI (e.g., due to nonlinearities) and
many more. Finally, we introduce the class of spatially coupled (SC)-LDPC
codes, which are a generalization of LDPC codes with some outstanding
properties and which can be decoded with a very simple windowed decoder. We
show that the universal behavior of spatially coupled codes makes them an ideal
candidate for iterative differential demodulation/detection and decoding.

gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) scenario based on the gauge group $SU(3)$ x
$U(1)'$ in 5-dimensional Minkowski space with a compactification of the 5th
dimension on $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. The dark matter particle is identified with
the lightest mode in $SU(3)$ triplet fermions additionally introduced in the
5-dimensional bulk. We find an allowed parameter region for the dark matter
mass around a half of the Standard Model Higgs boson mass, which is consistent
with the observed dark matter density and the constraint from the LUX 2016
result for the direct dark matter search. The entire allowed region will be
covered by, for example, the LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment in the near
future. We also show that in the presence of the bulk $SU(3)$ triplet fermions
the 125 GeV Higgs boson mass is reproduced through the renormalization group
evolution of Higgs quartic coupling with the compactification scale of around
$10^8$ GeV.

de-synchronized. Such networks, which arise in many important application
fields such as systems biology, are characterized by the fact that direct
communication between network nodes is superimposed to communication with a
shared, environmental, variable. In particular, we provide a new sufficient
condition ensuring that the trajectories of these quorum-sensing networks
diverge from their synchronous evolution. Then, we apply our result to study
two applications.

testing Hilbert space multi-dimensional (HSM) models, which are based on
quantum probability theory. HSM models can be applied to collections of K
different contingency tables obtained from a set of p variables that are
measured under different contexts. A context is defined by the measurement of a
subset of the p variables that are used to form a table. HSM models provide a
representation of the collection of K tables in a low dimensional vector space,
even when no single joint probability distribution across the p variables
exists. HSM models produce parameter estimates that provide a simple and
informative interpretation of the complex collection of tables. Comparisons of
HSM model fits with Bayes net model fits are reported for a new large
experiment, demonstrating the viability of this new model. We conclude that the
model is broadly applicable to social and behavioral science data sets.

guarantee robustness, because efficiency also requires an ingenious interplay
of the interacting modular components. The human brain is the elemental
paradigm of an efficient robust modular system interconnected as a network of
networks (NoN). Understanding the emergence of robustness in such modular
architectures from the interconnections of its parts is a long-standing
challenge that has concerned many scientists. Current models of dependencies in
NoN inspired by the power grid express interactions among modules with fragile
couplings that amplify even small shocks, thus preventing functionality.
Therefore, we introduce a model of NoN to shape the pattern of brain
activations to form a modular environment that is robust. The model predicts
the map of neural collective influencers (NCIs) in the brain, through the
optimization of the influence of the minimal set of essential nodes responsible
for broadcasting information to the whole-brain NoN. Our results suggest new
intervention protocols to control brain activity by targeting influential
neural nodes predicted by network theory.

attained an unprecedented sensitivity, resulting in the first direct detections
of gravitational-wave signals and GW151226, produced by stellar-mass binary
black hole systems. This paper reports on an all-sky search for gravitational
waves (GWs) from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHBs). The
combined results from two independent search techniques were used in this
study: the first employs a matched-filter algorithm that uses a bank of filters
covering the GW signal parameter space, while the second is a generic search
for GW transients (bursts). No GWs from IMBHBs were detected, therefore, we
constrain the rate of several classes of IMBHB mergers. The most stringent
limit is obtained for black holes of individual mass $100\,M_\odot$, with spins
aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. For such systems, the merger
rate is constrained to be less than $0.93~\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr}^{-1}$ in
comoving units at the $90\%$ confidence level, an improvement of nearly 2
orders of magnitude over previous upper limits.

it becomes purely erasure for large frequencies. In addition the time behavior

required to be curtailed or may be supplied to the grid.

unambiguously detected, some for the first time, such as ketene H$_2$CCO,
dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) and glycolaldehyde (HCOCH$_2$OH), and others
firmly confirmed, such as formic acid (HCOOH) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH).
Thanks to the high sensitivity of the observations and full coverage of the 1,
2 and 3mm wavelength bands, we detected numerous (10--125) lines from each of
the detected species. Based on a simple rotational diagram analysis, we derive
the excitation conditions and the column densities of the detected COMs.
Combining our new results with those previously obtained towards other
protostellar objects, we found a good correlation between ethanol, methanol and
glycolaldehyde. We discuss the implications of these results on the possible
formation routes of ethanol and glycolaldehyde.

aligned with the municipalities' goals. In particular, a tool to compare
different plans and the respective costs and benefits is necessary to forecast
the consequences of the changes in mobility plans. The aim of this research is
to show how two different mobility models can be compared, based on different
plans, and how to use this comparison strategy to develop or review a mobility
plan. As a case study we analyzed the city of Barcelona, where in the last 10
years the municipality applied a new urban mobility plan, reviewed every 5
years (PMU 2007 and 2012). By using MATSim simulation tools, we realized two
models of the infrastructure network: in both we built metro, train, tram and

of the car network and the presence or absence of the bicycle network. The
results show that if we set low speed limits and increase bike infrastructures,
the average travel time decreases and the number of users of the bicycle
network increases to the detriment of public and private transport. In
particular, we show that the number of users of public transport decreases more
than the private transport users. This behavior is related to the lack of the
bus network, not simulated in these models, suggesting that the metro network
works properly only when it is integrated with a bus network.

Southern Mississippi's Center of Higher Learning, has been successfully used to
couple the Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) and
the ocean wave model WAVEWATCH. An example of its application is shown for
Hurricane Gordon, showing that two-way coupling results affects boundary layer
physics differently than one-way coupling --- in this case, resulting in larger
z_o and, consequently, larger surface fluxes and a more intense hurricane.
However, since analyzing MCEL is difficult because the wave physics is
inaccurate, improvements to the wave algorithms are also part of the
deliverables. A new analytical expression for the wind/wave growth factor has
been derived based on normal modes analysis and rapid distortion theory valid
for all wave regimes except for tropical cyclone conditions. This new algorithm
is validated against a numerical simulation of the Reynolds-stress transport
equations and matches well. In contrast, other wave growth expression used in
ocean models like the WAve Model (WAM) and WAVEWATCH do not produce the same
results, with larger wave growth values peaking at smaller wave age values.
These differences are attributed to the application of curve fitting by the
other algorithms, while the new formulation is an analytical expression derived
from first principles and includes factors missing in previous schemes such as
turbulent interaction. If the Reynolds-stress transport equations solutions are
reasonably accurate, it indicates that all the previous wave growth schemes,
including WAVEWATCH, have serious deficiencies. Another unique result from this
work includes a second analytical wave growth formulation valid for tropical
cyclone conditions.

function, generalized gamma function, Kratzel integral, inverse Gaussian
integral, reaction-rate probability integral, Bessel integral etc. We prove
several identities and recurrence relation of above said integral, we called
this integral as Four Parameter Gamma Function. Also we evaluate relation
between Four Parameter Gamma Function, p-k Gamma Function and Classical Gamma
Function. With some conditions we can evaluate Four Parameter Gamma Function in
term of Hypergeometric function.

this study by giving the definition of convex functions and some of their
properties and discussing a simple geometric property. Then we generalize
E-convex functions and establish some their properties. Moreover, we give
generalized $ s $-convex functions in the second sense and present some new
inequalities of generalized Hermite-Hadamard type for the class of functions
whose second local fractional derivatives of order $ \alpha $ in absolute value
at certain powers are generalized $ s $-convex functions in the second sense.
At the end, some examples that these inequalities are able to be applied to
some special means are showed.

"1705.00646","Robert Schaback","Robert Schaback","A Simple Solution for Maximum Range Flight",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within the standard framework of quasi-steady flight, this paper derives a
speed that realizes the maximal obtainable range per unit of fuel. If this
speed is chosen at each instant of a flight plan $h(x)$ giving altitude $h$ as
a function of distance $x$, a variational problem for finding an optimal $h(x)$
can be formulated and solved. It yields flight plans with maximal range, and
these turn out to consist of mainly three phases using the optimal speed:
starting with a climb at maximal continuous admissible thrust, ending with a
continuous descent at idle thrust, and in between with a transition based on a
solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the variational problem. A similar
variational problem is derived and solved for speed-restricted flights, e.g. at
250 KIAS below 10000 ft. In contrast to the literature, the approach of this
paper does not need more than standard ordinary differential equations solving
variational problems to derive range-optimal trajectories. Various numerical
examplesbased on a Standard Business Jet are added for illustration.

modelled using extensive spectroscopic data generated as part of the ExoMol
project. The external field Hamiltonian is built from the computed
ro-vibrational line list of the molecule in question. The Hamiltonian we
propose is general and suitable for any polar molecule in the presence of an
electric field. By exploiting precomputed data, the often prohibitively
expensive computations associated with high accuracy simulations of
molecule-field interactions are avoided. Applications to strong terahertz
field-induced ro-vibrational dynamics of PH$_3$ and NH$_3$, and spontaneous
emission data for optoelectrical Sisyphus cooling of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$Cl are
discussed.

taxonomies of innovation present in the economic fields to show as the economic
literature uses different names to indicate the same type of technical change
and innovation, and the same name for different types of innovation. This
ambiguity of classification makes it impossible to compare the various studies;
moreover the numerous typologies existing in the economics of innovation,
technometrics, economics of technical change, management of technology, etc.,
have hindered the development of knowledge in these fields. The research
presents also new directions on the classification of innovation that try to
overcome these problems.
