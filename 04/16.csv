network with agents in the form of multi-input multi-output minimum-phase
dynamics. Optimal output consensus can be taken as an extended version of the
existing output consensus problem for higher-order agents with an optimization
requirement, where the output variables of agents are driven to achieve a
consensus on the optimal solution of a global cost function. To solve this
problem, we first construct an optimal signal generator, and then propose an
embedded control scheme by embedding the generator in the feedback loop. We
give two kinds of algorithms based on different available information along
with both state feedback and output feedback, and prove that these algorithms
with the embedded technique can guarantee the solvability of the problem for
high-order multi-agent systems under standard assumptions.

provides an interesting scenario to study quantum transport phenomena or the
analog Hawking effect as the system can reach a quasi-stationary black-hole
configuration. We devote this work to characterize the quantum transport
properties of quasi-particles on top of this black-hole configuration by
computing the corresponding scattering matrix. We find that most of the
features can be understood in terms of the usual Schr\""odinger scattering. In
particular, a transmission band appears in the spectrum, with the normal-normal
transmission dominating over the anomalous-normal one. We show that this
picture still holds in a realistic experimental situation where the actual
Gaussian envelope of the optical lattice is considered. A peaked resonant
structure is displayed near the upper end of the transmission band, which
suggests that the proposed setup is a good candidate to provide a clear signal
of spontaneous Hawking radiation.

continuously with the increase of the charge and reaches $T_{\rm H}=0$ for the
highest possible charge that these solutions can carry. However, in this limit,
the scalar-tensor coupling needs to vanish. The limiting solution hence
corresponds to the extremal RN solution, which does not support regular

the literature, primarily due to the coexistence of retrospective and
prospective approaches to measuring citation age distributions. These two

the two. Here we developed a new theoretical framework that not only allows us
to connect the two approaches through precise mathematical relationships, it

the growth of science, helping us uncover new functional forms characterizing

lognormal distribution with exponential cutoff, while prospective distribution
is governed by the interplay between a lognormal distribution and the growth in
the number of references. Most interestingly, the two approaches can be
connected once rescaled by the growth of publications and citations. We further
validate our framework using both large-scale citation datasets and analytical

gap between different excited states they hybridize, leading to the appearance
of a rich and complex phenomenology which attracted remarkable interest in
recent years. While the mixing between states with different number of
excitations, so-called ultrastrong coupling regime, has been observed in
various implementations, the effect of the hybridization between different
single excitation states, referred to as very strong coupling regime, has
remained elusive. In semiconductor quantum wells such a regime is predicted to
manifest as a photon-mediated electron-hole coupling leading to different
excitonic wavefunctions for the two polaritonic branches when the ratio of the
coupling strength to exciton binding energy approaches unity. Here, we verify
experimentally the existence of this regime in magneto-optical measurements on
a microcavity with 28 GaAs quantum wells, showing that the average
electron-hole separation of the upper polariton is significantly increased
compared to the bare quantum well exciton Bohr radius. This manifests in a
diamagnetic shift around zero detuning that exceeds the shift of the lower
polariton by one order of magnitude and the bare quantum well exciton
diamagnetic shift by a factor of two. The lower polariton exhibits a
diamagnetic shift smaller than expected from the coupling of a rigid exciton to
the cavity mode which suggests more tightly bound electron-hole pairs than in
the bare quantum well.

temporal phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) to phase-demodulate the two close
sensitivity phases. Then we calculate their phase-difference and their
phase-sum. If the sensitivity between the two phases is close enough, their
phase-difference is not-wrapped. The non-wrapped phase-difference as
extended-range profilometry is well known and has been widely used. However as
this paper shows, the closeness between the two demodulated phases makes their
difference quite noisy. On the other hand, as we show, their phase-sum has a
much higher phase-sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio but it is highly
wrapped. Spatial unwrapping of the phase-sum is precluded for separate or
highly discontinuous objects. However it is possible to unwrap the phase-sum by
using the phase-difference as first approximation and our previously published
2-step temporal phase-unwrapping. Therefore the proposed profilometry technique
allows unwrapping the higher sensitivity phase-sum using the noisier
phase-difference as stepping stone. Due to the non-linear nature of the
extended 2-steps temporal-unwrapper, the harmonics and noise errors in the
phase-difference do not propagate towards the unwrapping phase-sum. To the best
of our knowledge this is the highest signal-to-noise ratio, extended

Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods are preferred for condition assessment

NDE methods are ground penetrating radar (GPR), acoustic emission, and
electrical resistivity (ER). NDE methods provide the ability to inspect a

require inspection sites to be evacuated prior to inspection, which greatly
reduces the cost of safety related issues during the inspection process. In

sensors is presented. The system employs GPR, ER, and a camera for data

supersymmetry scale is larger than what was thought before the LHC era. This
observation is strengthened by the Higgs boson mass measurement at $\sim 125$
GeV which within supersymmetric models implies a large loop correction and a
weak supersymmetry scale lying in the several TeV region. In addition if
neutralino is the dark matter, its relic density puts further constraints on
models often requiring coannihilation to reduce the neutralino relic density to
be consistent with experimental observation. The coannihilation in turn implies
that the mass gap between the LSP and the NLSP will be small leading to softer
final states and making the observation of supersymmetry challenging. In this
work we investigate stau coannihilation models within supergravity grand
unified models and the potential of discovery of such models at the LHC in the
post Higgs boson discovery era. We utilize a variety of signal regions to
optimize the discovery of supersymmetry in the stau coannihilation region. In
the analysis presented we impose the relic density constraint as well as the
constraint of the Higgs boson mass. The range of sparticle masses discoverable
up to the optimal integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC is investigated. It is
found that the mass difference between the stau and the neutralino does not
exceed $\sim 20$ GeV over the entire mass range of the models explored. Thus
the discovery of a supersymmetric signal arising from the stau coannihilation
region will also provide a measurement of the neutralino mass. The direct
detection of neutralino dark matter is analyzed within the class of stau
coannihilation models investigated. The analysis is extended to include
multi-particle coannihilation where stau along with chargino and the second
neutralino enter in the stau coannihilation process.

uses in real world applications. Drones require advanced planning and
navigation algorithms to enable them to safely move through and interact with
the world around them. This paper presents an extended potential field
controller (ePFC) which enables an aerial robot, or drone, to safely track a
dynamic target location while simultaneously avoiding any obstacles in its
path. The ePFC outperforms a traditional potential field controller (PFC) with
smoother tracking paths and shorter settling times. The proposed ePFC's
stability is evaluated by Lyapunov approach, and its performance is simulated
in a Matlab environment. Finally, the controller is implemented on an
experimental platform in a laboratory environment which demonstrates the
effectiveness of the controller.

Fourier series $S_n(x;f)$ have indices $n=(n_1,\dots,n_N) \in \mathbb Z^N$,
$N\ge 3$, in which $k$ $(1\leq k\leq N-2)$ components on the places
$\{j_1,\dots,j_k\}=J_k \subset \{1,\dots,N\} = M$ are elements of (single)
lacunary sequences (i.e., we consider the, so called, multiple Fourier series
with $J_k$-lacunary sequence of partial sums). We prove that for any sample
$J_k\subset M$ the Weyl multiplier for convergence of these series has the form
$W(\nu)=\prod \limits_{j=1}^{N-k} \log(|\nu_{{\alpha}_j}|+2)$, where
$\alpha_j\in M\setminus J_k $, $\nu=(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N)\in{\mathbb Z}^N$. So,
the ""one-dimensional"" Weyl multiplier -- $\log(|\cdot|+2)$ -- presents in
$W(\nu)$ only on the places of ""free"" (nonlacunary) components of the vector
$\nu$. Earlier, in the case where $N-1$ components of the index $n$ are
elements of lacunary sequences, convergence almost everywhere for multiple
Fourier series was obtained in 1977 by M.Kojima in the classes $L_p$, $p>1$,
and by D.K.Sanadze, Sh.V.Kheladze in Orlizc class. Note, that presence of two
or more ""free"" components in the index $n$ (as follows from the results by
Ch.Fefferman (1971)) does not guarantee the convergence almost everywhere of
$S_n(x;f)$ for $N\geq 3$ even in the class of continuous functions.

a bunch of models. Quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are
the most widely known (but, e.g., Bohmian mechanics is also a part of QT). The
basic problems of QM and QFT are considered in interrelation. For QM, we stress
its nonrelativistic character and the presence of spooky action at a distance.
For QFT, we highlight the old problem of infinities. And this is the main point
of the paper: it is meaningless to try to unify QFT so heavily suffering of
infinities with GR. We also highlight difficulties of the QFT-treatment of
entanglement. We compare the QFT and QM based measurement theories by
presenting both theoretical and experimental viewpoints. Then we discuss two
basic mathematical constraints of both QM and QFT, namely, the use of real
(and, hence, complex) numbers and the Hilbert state space. We briefly present
non-Archimedean and non-Hilbertian approaches to QT and their consequences.
Finally, we claim that, in spite of the Bell theorem, it is still possible to
treat quantum phenomena on the basis of a classical-like causal theory. We
present a random field model generating the QM and QFT formalisms. This
emergence viewpoint can serve as the basis for unification of novel QT (may be
totally different from presently powerful QM and QFT) and general relativity
GR. (It may happen that the latter would also be revolutionary modified.)

epistemic, which describe evolution of conformational and functional states of
proteins, respectively. The epistemic automaton is constructed from the ontic
automaton on the basis of functional (observational) equivalence relation on
the space of ontic states. This reminds a few approaches to emergent quantum
mechanics in which a quantum (epistemic) state is treated as representing a
class of prequantum (ontic) states. This approach does not match to the
standard {\it protein structure-function paradigm.} However, it is perfect for
modeling of behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. Mathematically space

renormalization group (RG). To this end, we present a detailed analysis of the
real-space RG for discrete-time quantum walks on fractal networks and show how
deep insights into the analytic structure as well as generic results about the
long-time behavior can be extracted. The RG-flow for such a walk on a dual
Sierpinski gasket and a Migdal-Kadanoff hierarchical network is obtained
explicitly from elementary algebraic manipulations, after transforming the
unitary evolution equation into Laplace space. Unlike for classical random
walks, we find that the long-time asymptotics for the quantum walk requires
consideration of a diverging number of Laplace-poles, which we demonstrate
exactly for the closed form solution available for the walk on a 1d-loop. In
particular, we calculate the probability of the walk to overlap with its
starting position, which oscillates with a period that scales as
$N^{d_{w}^{Q}/d_{f}}$ with system size $N$. While the largest Jacobian
eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}$ of the RG-flow merely reproduces the fractal
dimension, $d_{f}=\log_{2}\lambda_{1}$, the asymptotic analysis shows that the
second Jacobian eigenvalue $\lambda_{2}$ becomes essential to determine the
dimension of the quantum walk via
$d_{w}^{Q}=\log_{2}\sqrt{\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}}$. We trace this fact to
delicate cancellations caused by unitarity. We obtain identical relations for
other networks, although the details of the RG-analysis may exhibit
surprisingly distinct features. Thus, our conclusions -- which trivially
reproduce those for regular lattices with translational invariance with
$d_{f}=d$ and $d_{w}^{Q}=1$ -- appear to be quite general and likely apply to
networks beyond those studied here.

protoplanetary disks through consideration of disk 'dust lines' which indicate
the observed disk radial scale at different observational wavelengths. This
method relies on the assumption that the processes of particle growth and drift
control the radial scale of the disk at late stages of disk evolution such that
the lifetime of the disk is equal to both the drift timescale and growth
timescale of the maximum particle size at a given dust line. We provide an
initial proof of concept of our model through an application to the disk TW Hya
and are able to estimate the disk dust-to-gas ratio, CO abundance, and
accretion rate in addition to the total disk surface density. We find that our
derived surface density profile and dust-to-gas ratio are consistent with the
lower limits found through measurements of HD gas. The CO ice line also depends
on surface density through grain adsorption rates and drift and we find that
our theoretical CO ice line estimates have clear observational analogues. We
further apply our model to a large parameter space of theoretical disks and
find three observational diagnostics that may be used to test its validity.
First we predict that the dust lines of disks other than TW Hya will be
consistent with the normalized CO surface density profile shape for those
disks. Second, surface density profiles that we derive from disk ice lines
should match those derived from disk dust lines. Finally, we predict that disk
dust and ice lines will scale oppositely, as a function of surface density,
across a large sample of disks.

Nusselt number $Nu$, on Ekman pumping for rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard

number $Pr = 1$. A joint effort utilizing simulations from the Composite
Non-hydrostatic Quasi-Geostrophic model (CNH-QGM) and direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of the incompressible fluid equations has mapped a wide range
of the Rayleigh number $Ra$ - Ekman number $E$ parameter space within the
geostrophic regime of rotating convection. Corroboration of the $Nu$-$Ra$
relation at $E = 10^{-7}$ from both methods along with higher $E$ covered by
DNS and lower $E$ by the asymptotic model allows for this range of the heat
transfer results. For stress-free boundaries, the relation $Nu-1 \propto (Ra
E^{4/3} )^{\alpha} $ has the dissipation-free scaling of $\alpha = 3/2$ for all
$E \leq 10^{-7}$. This is directly related to a geostrophic turbulent interior
that throttles the heat transport supplied to the thermal boundary layers. For
no-slip boundaries, the existence of ageostrophic viscous boundary layers and
their associated Ekman pumping yields a more complex 2D surface in $Nu(E,Ra)$
parameter space. For $E<10^{-7}$ results suggest that the surface can be
expressed as $Nu-1 \propto (1+ P(E)) (Ra E^{4/3} )^{3/2}$ indicating the
dissipation-free scaling law is enhanced by Ekman pumping by the multiplicative
prefactor $(1+ P(E))$ where $P(E) \approx 5.97 E^{1/8}$. It follows for
$E<10^{-7}$ that the geostrophic turbulent interior remains the flux bottleneck
in rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. For $E\sim10^{-7}$, where DNS
and asymptotic simulations agree quantitatively, it is found that the effects
of Ekman pumping are sufficiently strong to influence the heat transport with
diminished exponent $\alpha \approx 1.2$ and $Nu-1 \propto (Ra E^{4/3}

as the estimation of a modulating phase coming from an FUV

demodulated phase of four visible-wavelength interferograms. FUV
equivalent-wavelength phase-sensitivity is of course beyond the
phase-information capacity of a single visible-wavelength interferogram. To
break this visible-wavelength barrier we use the phase-information provided by
four or more interferograms in the visible range. Having the four demodulated
phases we calculate a phase-difference and the sum of the four phases which is
the FUV-equivalent super-resolution phase. The phase-difference is in the
infrared phase-sensitivity range and it is assumed non-wrapped. On the other
hand the phase-sum is in the FUV phase-sensitivity range and it is
highly-wrapped. As shown herein it is possible to unwrap the phase-sum in the
temporal domain using the phase-difference and our previously reported
extended-range 2-step temporal phase-unwrapper. Of course higher than FUV
equivalent phase-sensitivity interferometry may be obtained by increasing the
number of independent estimated phases from visible-wavelength interferograms.

Feynman integral evaluates to a multiple zeta value. One of these conditions is
called reducibility, which loosely says there is an order of integration for
the Feynman integral for which Brown's techniques will succeed. Reducibility
can be abstracted away from the Feynman integral to just being a condition on
two polynomials, the first and second Symanzik polynomials. These polynomials
can be defined from graphs, and thus reducibility is a property of graphs. We
prove that for a fixed number of external momenta and no masses, reducibility
is graph minor closed, correcting the previously claimed proofs of this fact. A
computational study of reducibility was undertaken by Bogner and L\""{u}ders who
found that for graphs with $4$-on-shell momenta and no masses, $K_{4}$ with
momenta on each vertex is a forbidden minor. We add to this and find that when
we restrict to graphs with four on-shell external momenta the following graphs
are forbidden minors: $K_{4}$ with momenta on each vertex, $W_{4}$ with
external momenta on the rim vertices, $K_{2,4}$ with external momenta on the
large side of the bipartition, and one other graph. We do not expect that these
minors characterize reducibility, so instead we give structural
characterizations of the graphs not containing subsets of these minors. We
characterize graphs not containing a rooted $K_{4}$ or rooted $W_{4}$ minor,
graphs not containing rooted $K_{4}$ or rooted $W_{4}$ or rooted $K_{2,4}$
minors, and also a characterization of graphs not containing all of the known

MIMO systems, where, in order to significantly reduce the hardware cost and
power consumption, one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used at the
base station (BS) to quantize the received signal. Channel estimation for
one-bit massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the severe distortion caused
by the coarse quantization. It was shown in previous studies that an extremely
long training sequence is required to attain an acceptable performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of optimal one-bit quantization design for channel
estimation in one-bit massive MIMO systems. Our analysis reveals that, if the
quantization thresholds are optimally devised, using one-bit ADCs can achieve
an estimation error close to (with an increase by a factor of $\pi/2$) that of
an ideal estimator which has access to the unquantized data. The optimal
quantization thresholds, however, are dependent on the unknown channel
parameters. To cope with this difficulty, we propose an adaptive quantization
(AQ) approach in which the thresholds are adaptively adjusted in a way such
that the thresholds converge to the optimal thresholds, and a random
quantization (RQ) scheme which randomly generate a set of nonidentical
thresholds based on some statistical prior knowledge of the channel. Simulation
results show that, our proposed AQ and RQ schemes, owing to their wisely
devised thresholds, present a significant performance improvement over the
conventional fixed quantization scheme that uses a fixed (typically zero)
threshold, and meanwhile achieve a substantial training overhead reduction for
channel estimation. In particular, even with a moderate number of pilot symbols

process in pharmaceutical applications through using Stochastic Model
Predictive Control (SMPC) and model reduction to obtain the desired particle

integro-differential equation down to a nonlinear ordinary differential
equation (ODE). This reduced-order model is employed in the SMPC formulation.
The probabilistic constraints in this formulation keep the variance of
particles' drug concentration in an admissible range. To solve the resulting
stochastic optimization problem, we first employ polynomial chaos expansion to
obtain the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the future state

original stochastic optimization problem for a particulate system is converted
to a deterministic dynamic optimization. This approximation lessens the
computation burden of the controller and makes its real time application

make a norm change desirable), and exploration rate (the willingness of agents
to try out new strategies). Our results show that a high need for coordination
leads to both high cultural inertia and a low exploration rate, while a low
need for coordination leads to low cultural inertia and high exploration rate.

pre-compensation at the transmitter with a large-scale uniform linear array
(ULA). The transmitted signal passes through a beamforming network with
high-spatial resolution to produce multiple parallel branches. Each branch
transmits signal towards one direction thus it is affected by one dominant DFO
when passing over the time-varying channel. Therefore, we can compensate the
DFO for each branch at the transmitter previously. Theoretical analysis for the
Doppler spread of the equivalent uplink channel is also conducted. It is found
that when the number of transmit antennas is sufficiently large, the
time-variation of channel can be efficiently suppressed. Therefore, the
performance will not degrade significantly if applying the conventional
time-invariant channel estimation and equalization methods at the receiver.

applying to this situation the moments method recently derived by Moln\'ar et
al. (MNR) [1,2], based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic
one-particle distribution function. One requires an additional evolution
equation in order to close the conservation laws. This is achieved by selecting
the relaxation equation for the longitudinal pressure with a suitable Landau
matching condition. As a result one obtains two coupled differential equations
for the energy density and the longitudinal pressure which respect the
$SO(3)_q\otimes SO(1,1)\otimes Z_2$ symmetry of the Gubser flow in the deSitter
space. These equations are solved numerically and compared with the predictions

  Matching Constraints","VLDB 2017",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Determining if two sets are related - that is, if they have similar values or
if one set contains the other - is an important problem with many applications
in data cleaning, data integration, and information retrieval. A particularly
popular metric that has been proposed is to measure the relatedness of two sets
by treating the elements as vertices of a bipartite graph and calculating the
score of the maximum matching pairing between elements. Compared to other
metrics which require exact matchings between elements, this metric uses a
similarity function to compare elements between the two sets, making it robust
to small dissimilarities in elements and more useful for real-world, dirty
data. Unfortunately, the metric suffers from expensive computational cost,
taking O(n^3) time, where n is the number of elements in sets, for each
set-to-set comparison. Thus for applications which try to search for all
pairings of related sets in a brute-force manner, the runtime becomes
unacceptably large.
  To address this challenge, we developed SilkMoth, a system capable of rapidly
discovering related set pairs in collections of sets. Internally, SilkMoth
creates a signature for each set, with the property that any other set which is
related must match the signature. SilkMoth then uses these signatures to prune
the search space, so only sets which match the signatures are left as
candidates. Finally, SilkMoth applies the maximum matching metric on remaining
candidates to verify which of these candidates are truly related sets. Thus, a
contribution of this paper is the characterization of the space of signatures
which enable this property. We show that selecting the optimal signature in
this space is NP-complete, and based on insights from the characterization of
the space, we propose two novel filters which help to prune the candidates
further before verification.

According to majorization theory, a higher Lorenz curve implies that all

Shannon) entropy-based measures of the beam width products in near and far

CBSA integrates Assume-Guarantee (A-G) reasoning with the core principles of
the Simplex control architecture to allow component-based CPSs to run advanced,
uncertified controllers while still providing runtime assurance that A-G
contracts and global properties are satisfied. In CBSA, multiple Simplex
instances, which can be composed in a nested, serial or parallel manner,
coordinate to assure system-wide properties. Combining A-G reasoning and the
Simplex architecture is a challenging problem that yields significant benefits.
By utilizing A-G contracts, we are able to compositionally determine the
switching logic for CBSAs, thereby alleviating the state explosion encountered
by other approaches. Another benefit is that we can use A-G proof rules to
decompose the proof of system-wide safety assurance into sub-proofs
corresponding to the component-based structure of the system architecture. We
also introduce the notion of coordinated switching between Simplex instances, a
key component of our compositional approach to reasoning about CBSA switching
logic. We illustrate our framework with a component-based control system for a
ground rover. We formally prove that the CBSA for this system guarantees energy
safety (the rover never runs out of power), and collision freedom (the rover
never collides with a stationary obstacle). We also consider a CBSA for the
rover that guarantees mission completion: all target destinations visited
within a prescribed amount of time.

throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed

the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are
the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order
execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, ...) that help average
throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps
explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively
small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and
an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters.
Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production
NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters'
NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is
on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with
TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the

does not suffer from the hierarchy-$\delta_{13}$ degeneracy and thus NO$\nu$A
can have good hierarchy sensitivity for this true combination of hierarchy and
$\delta_{13}$. Apart from the hierarchy-$\delta_{13}$ degeneracy there is also
the octant-$\delta_{13}$ degeneracy. But this does not affect the favorable

the parameter space for hierarchy-$\delta_{14}$ degeneracy is different in

Then, we illustrate by fitness landscape analysis that the backbone can be well

we propose an approximate backbone based multilevel algorithm (ABMA) to solve
large scale NRP instances. This algorithm iteratively explores the search

satellite such as Hipparcos or Gaia relies on the short-term stability of the
so-called basic angle between the two viewing directions. Uncalibrated
variations of the basic angle may produce systematic errors in the computed
parallaxes. We examine the coupling between a global parallax shift and
specific variations of the basic angle, namely those related to the satellite
attitude with respect to the Sun. The changes in observables produced by small
perturbations of the basic angle, attitude, and parallaxes are calculated
analytically. We then look for a combination of perturbations that has no net
effect on the observables. In the approximation of infinitely small fields of
view, it is shown that certain perturbations of the basic angle are
observationally indistinguishable from a global shift of the parallaxes. If
such perturbations exist, they cannot be calibrated from the astrometric
observations but will produce a global parallax bias. Numerical simulations of
the astrometric solution, using both direct and iterative methods, confirm this
theoretical result. For a given amplitude of the basic angle perturbation, the
parallax bias is smaller for a larger basic angle and a larger solar aspect
angle. In both these respects Gaia has a more favourable geometry than
Hipparcos. In the case of Gaia, internal metrology is used to monitor basic
angle variations. Additionally, Gaia has the advantage of detecting numerous
quasars, which can be used to verify the parallax zero point.

According to the demonstration website, the API ""quickly classifies images into

to ""detect different types of inappropriate content from adult to violent

  In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API to input

image, the API generates completely different outputs for the noisy image,
while a human observer would perceive its original content. We show that the
attack is consistently successful, by performing extensive experiments on
different image types, including natural images, images containing faces and
images with texts. For instance, using images from ImageNet dataset, we found
that adding an average of 14.25% impulse noise is enough to deceive the API.
Our findings indicate the vulnerability of the API in adversarial environments.
For example, an adversary can bypass an image filtering system by adding noise
to inappropriate images. We then show that when a noise filter is applied on
input images, the API generates mostly the same outputs for restored images as

and now play a main role in many telecommunications systems. As a consequence,
scarce radio resources, such as frequencies, became congested and the need for
effective and efficient assignment methods arose. In this work, we present a
Genetic Algorithm for solving large instances of the Power, Frequency and
Modulation Assignment Problem, arising in the design of wireless networks. To
our best knowledge, this is the first Genetic Algorithm that is proposed for
such problem. Compared to previous works, our approach allows a wider
exploration of the set of power solutions, while eliminating sources of
numerical problems. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by tests over
a set of large realistic instances of a Fixed WiMAX Network.

shown to be useful for solving the heat equation with a non smooth initial
condition. We show that the nonstandard solution to the heat equation with a
smooth initial condition specialises to the classical solution.

  of its impact on aerosol optical properties",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A stochastic method is introduced for geometric modeling aerosol surface
roughness with random field and discrete differential geometry theory. Optical
scattering properties are computed for randomly oriented spheroidal particles
with uniformly random surface roughness. Invariant imbedding T-Matrix and
geometric optics method are applied to compute light scattering properties of
aerosol particles covered from Rayleigh to geometric optics region. We
simulatied scattering phase matrix of model particles, better performace is
obtained than smooth particles. We aslo introduce introduce entropy and
relative entropy as measures to distinguish the optical scattering similarities
between different particles.

considered for mobile service provisioning in commercial networks. To be able
to efficiently use these devices in cellular networks it is necessary to first
have a qualitative and quantitative understanding of how their design
parameters reflect on the service quality experienced by the end user. In this
paper we set up a scenario where a network of UAVs operating at a certain
height above ground provide wireless service within coverage areas shaped by
their directional antennas. We provide an analytical expression for the
coverage probability experienced by a typical user as a function of the UAV
parameters.

tableau (PT) sequences that have potential applications in cryptography and
communications. The PT sequence of rank p is obtained from numbers arranged in
a tableau with p columns where primes are marked off until each column has at
least one prime and where the column entries are added modulo 2. We also
examine the dual to the PT sequences obtained by adding the rows of the
tableau. It is shown that PT sequences have excellent autocorrelation
properties.

describes an essential cognitive process for comparing values of objects and
making a selection decision. This model is constructed by the quantum-like
approach that employs the state representation specific to quantum theory,
which has the mathematical framework beyond the classical probability theory.
We show that our quantum approach can clearly explain the famous examples of
anomalies for the expected utility theory, the Ellsberg paradox, the Machina
paradox and the disparity between WTA and WTP. Further, we point out that our
model mathematically specifies the characteristics of the probability weighting
function and the value function, which are basic concepts in the prospect
theory.
