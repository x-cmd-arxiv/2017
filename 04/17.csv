  Communications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose two novel schemes to solve the problem of finding a
quasi-optimal number of coded packets to multicast to a set of independent
wireless receivers suffering different channel conditions. In particular, we
propose two network channel virtualization schemes that allow for representing
the set of intended receivers in a multicast group to be virtualized as one
receiver. Such approach allows for a transmission scheme not only adapted to
per-receiver channel variation over time, but to the network-virtualized
channel representing all receivers in the multicast group. The first scheme
capitalizes on a maximum erasure criterion introduced via the creation of a
virtual worst per receiver per slot reference channel of the network. The
second scheme capitalizes on a maximum completion time criterion by the use of
the worst performing receiver channel as a virtual reference to the network. We
apply such schemes to a GEO satellite scenario. We demonstrate the benefits of
the proposed schemes comparing them to a per-receiver point-to-point adaptive
strategy.

  Homotopy Approach","9 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SY math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The solution space of any set of power flow equations may contain different
number of real-valued solutions. The boundaries that separate these regions are
referred to as power flow solution space boundaries. Knowledge of these
boundaries is important as they provide a measure for voltage stability.
Traditionally, continuation based methods have been employed to compute these
boundaries on the basis of initial guesses for the solution. However, with
rapid growth of renewable energy sources these boundaries will be increasingly
affected by variable parameters such as penetration levels, locations of the
renewable sources, and voltage set-points, making it difficult to generate an
initial guess that can guarantee all feasible solutions for the power flow
problem. In this paper we solve this problem by applying a numerical polynomial
homotopy based continuation method. The proposed method guarantees to find all
solution boundaries within a given parameter space up to a chosen level of
discretization, independent of any initial guess. Power system operators can
use this computational tool conveniently to plan the penetration levels of
renewable sources at different buses. We illustrate the proposed method through
simulations on 3-bus and 10-bus power system examples with renewable
generation.

human body to probabilistically combine per view 2D ConvNet predictions into a
globally optimal 3D pose. This 3D pose is used as the basis for harvesting

approach is demonstrated in two challenging settings: (i) fine-tuning a generic
ConvNet-based 2D pose predictor to capture the discriminative aspects of a
subject's appearance (i.e.,""personalization""), and (ii) training a ConvNet from

technological, and biological networks. Yet this task is extremely challenging
due to the sheer size and the structural heterogeneity of networks. We
investigate a new influence measure, termed outward influence (OI), defined as
the (expected) number of nodes that a subset of nodes $S$ will activate,
excluding the nodes in S. Thus, OI equals, the de facto standard measure,
influence spread of S minus |S|. OI is not only more informative for nodes with
small influence, but also, critical in designing new effective sampling and
statistical estimation methods.
  Based on OI, we propose SIEA/SOIEA, novel methods to estimate influence
spread/outward influence at scale and with rigorous theoretical guarantees. The
proposed methods are built on two novel components 1) IICP an important
sampling method for outward influence, and 2) RSA, a robust mean estimation
method that minimize the number of samples through analyzing variance and range
of random variables. Compared to the state-of-the art for influence estimation,
SIEA is $\Omega(\log^4 n)$ times faster in theory and up to several orders of
magnitude faster in practice. For the first time, influence of nodes in the
networks of billions of edges can be estimated with high accuracy within a few
minutes. Our comprehensive experiments on real-world networks also give
evidence against the popular practice of using a fixed number, e.g. 10K or 20K,

study of software architecture. A major portion of this effort has focused on
the originally proposed view of four ""C""s---components, connectors,
configurations, and constraints---that are the building blocks of a system's
architecture. Despite being simple and appealing, this view has proven to be
incomplete and has required further elaboration. To that end, researchers have
more recently tried to approach architectures from another important
perspective---that of design decisions that yield a system's architecture.
These more recent efforts have lacked a precise understanding of several key
questions, however: (1) What is an architectural design decision (definition)?
(2) How can architectural design decisions be found in existing systems
(identification)? (3) What system decisions are and are not architectural
(classification)? (4) How are architectural design decisions manifested in the
code (reification)? (5) How can important architectural decisions be preserved

consumption and has great potential for energy saving. This paper designs an
LED light control algorithm based on users' localization using multiple

system focuses on reducing office lighting energy consumption and satisfying
users' illumination requirement. Most current lighting control systems use
infrared human detection sensors, but the poor detection probability,
especially for a static user, makes it difficult to realize comfortable and
effective lighting control. To improve the detection probability of each
sensor, we proposed to locate sensors as close to each user as possible by
using a battery-less wireless sensor network, in which all sensors can be
placed freely in the space with high energy stability. We also proposed to use
a multi-sensor-based user localization algorithm to capture user's position
more accurately and realize fine lighting control which works even with static
users. The system is actually implemented in an indoor office environment in a
pilot project. A verification experiment is conducted by measuring the
practical illumination and power consumption. The performance agrees with
design expectations. It shows that the proposed LED lighting control system
reduces the energy consumption significantly, 57% compared to the batch control
scheme, and satisfies user's illumination requirement with 100% probability.

truncated variational EM approximations are applied to Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) with isotropic Gaussians. In contrast to the standard way to relate
$k$-means and GMMs, the provided derivation shows that it is not required to
consider Gaussians with small variances or the limit case of zero variances.
There are a number of consequences that directly follow from our approach: (A)
$k$-means can be shown to increase a free energy associated with truncated
distributions and this free energy can directly be reformulated in terms of the
$k$-means objective; (B) $k$-means generalizations can directly be derived by
considering the 2nd closest, 3rd closest etc. cluster in addition to just the
closest one; and (C) the embedding of $k$-means into a free energy framework
allows for theoretical interpretations of other $k$-means generalizations in
the literature. In general, truncated variational EM provides a natural and
rigorous quantitative link between $k$-means-like clustering and GMM clustering
algorithms which may be very relevant for future theoretical and empirical
studies.

vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations that can provide wireless service to
ground users is investigated. In particular, a novel framework for optimizing
the performance of such UAV-based wireless systems in terms of the average
number of bits (data service) transmitted to users as well as UAVs' hover
duration (i.e. flight time) is proposed. In the considered model, UAVs hover
over a given geographical area to serve ground users that are distributed
within the area based on an arbitrary spatial distribution function. In this
case, two practical scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, based on
the maximum possible hover times of UAVs, the average data service delivered to
the users under a fair resource allocation scheme is maximized by finding the
optimal cell partitions associated to the UAVs. Using the mathematical
framework of optimal transport theory, a gradient-based algorithm is proposed
for optimally partitioning the geographical area based on the users'
distribution, hover times, and locations of the UAVs. In the second scenario,
given the load requirements of ground users, the minimum average hover time
that the UAVs need for completely servicing their ground users is derived. To
this end, first, an optimal bandwidth allocation scheme for serving the users
is proposed. Then, given this optimal bandwidth allocation, the optimal cell
partitions associated with the UAVs are derived by exploiting the optimal
transport theory. Results show that our proposed cell partitioning approach
leads to a significantly higher fairness among the users compared to the
classical weighted Voronoi diagram. In addition, our results reveal an inherent
tradeoff between the hover time of UAVs and bandwidth efficiency while serving
the ground users.

transceivers to the frequency domain, via a linear Fourier transformation. As a
result, the explicit impact of hardware inaccuracies on the residual

very little was known about the underlying psychology of this complex and
nuanced phenomenon. Recently, however, cognitive psychologists have begun
investigating how people understand humor and why we find certain things funny.
This chapter introduces a new cognitive approach to modeling humor that we
refer to as the 'quantum approach', which will be explained here in intuitive,
non-mathematical terms later (a formal treatment can be found in Gabora &
Kitto, 2017). What makes the quantum approach a promising candidate for a
theory of humor is that it can be useful for representing states of ambiguity,
and it defines states and variables with reference to a context. Contextuality
and ambiguity both play a key role in humor, which often hangs on an ambiguous
word, phrase, or situation that might not make sense, or even be socially
acceptable outside the specific context of the joke. The quantum approach does
not attempt to explain all aspects of humor, such as the contagious quality of
laughter, or why children tease each other, or why people might find it funny
when someone is hit in the face with a pie (and laugh even if they know it will
happen in advance); what it aims to do is to mathematically represent the
underlying cognitive process of ""getting"" a joke. After briefly overviewing the
relevant historical antecedents of the quantum approach and other related
approaches in cognitive psychology, we present the theoretical basis of our
approach, and outline a recent study that provides empirical support for it.

distance with the relative entropy in the Monge-Kantorovich problem. It was
first addressed by Schr\""odinger as the problem of describing the most likely
evolution of a large number of Brownian particles conditioned to reach an
""unexpected configuration"". Its optimal value, the \textit{entropic
transportation cost}, and its optimal solution, the \textit{Schr\""odinger
bridge}, stand as the natural probabilistic counterparts to the transportation
cost and displacement interpolation. Moreover, they provide a natural way of
lifting from the point to the measure setting the concept of Brownian bridge.
In this article, we prove that the Schr\""odinger bridge solves a second order
equation in the Riemannian structure of optimal transport. Roughly speaking,
the equation says that its acceleration is the gradient of the Fisher
information. Using this result, we obtain a fine quantitative description of
the dynamics, and a new functional inequality for the entropic transportation
cost, that generalize Talagrand's transportation inequality. Finally, we study
the convexity of the Fisher information along Schr\""odigner bridges, under the
hypothesis that the associated \textit{reciprocal characteristic} is convex.

\emph{Feynman-Kac penalisations} of Brownian motion.

is performed based on a new well-posed optimization model, which can be solved

determined in localized regions of relatively small extents, which are

learning. In this paper a novel Boosting-type algorithm is proposed based on
restricted gradient descent with structural sparsity control whose underlying
dynamics are governed by differential inclusions. In particular, we present an
iterative regularization path with structural sparsity where the parameter is
sparse under some linear transforms, based on variable splitting and the
Linearized Bregman Iteration. Hence it is called \emph{Split LBI}. Despite its
simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory
and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a
proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under
a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary
and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some $\ell_2$
error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and
benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by several applications including
image denoising, partial order ranking of sport teams, and world university

shocked by jets and/or outflows can be traced by far-IR (FIR) emission in
certain sources. We want to provide a consistent catalogue of selected atomic

the FIR, separate and characterize the contribution from the jet and the disc
to the observed line emission, and place the observations in an evolutionary

protoplanetary discs around 76 T Tauri stars located in Taurus are analysed.
The observations were carried out within the Herschel key programme Gas in
Protoplanetary Systems (GASPS). The spectra were obtained with the
Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS). The sample is first divided
in outflow and non-outflow sources according to literature tabulations. With
the aid of archival stellar/disc and jet/outflow tracers and model predictions
(PDRs and shocks), correlations are explored to constrain the physical
mechanisms behind the observed line emission. The much higher detection rate of
emission lines in outflow sources and the compatibility of line ratios with
shock model predictions supports the idea of a dominant contribution from the
jet/outflow to the line emission, in particular at earlier stages of the
stellar evolution as the brightness of FIR lines depends in large part on the

mixtures in a hierarchical manner to model multiple related data samples
jointly. In such settings several data features are commonly present: (i) the
related samples often share some, if not all, of the mixture components but
with differing weights, (ii) only some, not all, of the mixture components vary
across the samples, and (iii) often the shared mixture components across
samples are not aligned perfectly in terms of their location and spread, but
rather display small misalignments either due to systematic cross-sample
difference or more often due to uncontrolled, extraneous causes. Properly
incorporating these features in mixture modeling will enhance the efficiency of
inference, whereas ignoring them not only reduces efficiency but can jeopardize
the validity of the inference due to issues such as confounding. We introduce
two techniques for incorporating these features in modeling related data
samples using kernel mixtures. The first technique, called $\psi$-stick
breaking, is a joint generative process for the mixing weights through the
breaking of both a stick shared by all the samples for the components that do
not vary in size across samples and an idiosyncratic stick for each sample for
those components that do vary in size. The second technique is to imbue random
perturbation into the kernels, thereby accounting for cross-sample
misalignment. These techniques can be used either separately or together in
both parametric and nonparametric kernel mixtures. We derive efficient Bayesian
inference recipes based on MCMC sampling for models featuring these techniques,
and illustrate their work through both simulated data and a real flow cytometry
data set in prediction/estimation, cross-sample calibration, and testing
multi-sample differences.

metric for investigating the timeliness performance in information-update
systems. Prior studies on AoI optimization often consider a Push model, which
is concerned about when and how to ""push"" (i.e., generate and transmit) the
updated information to the user. In stark contrast, in this paper we introduce
a new Pull model, which is more relevant for certain applications (such as the
real-time stock quotes service), where a user sends requests to the servers to
proactively ""pull"" the information of interest. Moreover, we propose to employ
request replication to reduce the AoI. Interestingly, we find that under this
new Pull model, replication schemes capture a novel tradeoff between different
levels of information freshness and different response times across the
servers, which can be exploited to minimize the expected AoI at the user's
side. Specifically, assuming Poisson updating process at the servers and
exponentially distributed response time, we derive a closedform formula for
computing the expected AoI and obtain the optimal number of responses to wait
for to minimize the expected AoI. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to
elucidate our theoretical results. Our findings show that waiting for more than
one response can significantly reduce the AoI in most scenarios.

integrable and non-integrable systems. This implies that scrambling is a

non-integrability. Furthermore, we calculate TMI in disordered systems such as

Riemann-Hilbert representations have proven to be useful for extracting the

throughput. By pre-downloading contents to local caches of users, the content
requested by a user can be transmitted via D2D links by other users in
proximity. Prior works optimize the caching policy at users with the knowledge
of content popularity, defined as the probability distribution of request for
every file in a library from by all users. However, content popularity can not
reflect the interest of each individual user and thus popularity-based caching
policy may not fully capture the performance gain introduced by caching. In
this paper, we optimize caching policy for cache-enabled D2D by learning user
preference, defined as the conditional probability distribution of a user's
request for a file given that the user sends a request. We first formulate an
optimization problem with given user preference to maximize the offloading
probability, which is proved as NP-hard, and then provide a greedy algorithm to
find the solution. In order to predict the preference of each individual user,
we model the user request behavior by probabilistic latent semantic analysis
(pLSA), and then apply expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the
model parameters. Simulation results show that the user preference can be
learnt quickly. Compared to the popularity-based caching policy, the offloading
gain achieved by the proposed policy can be remarkably improved even with
predicted user preference.

$\mathrm{U(1)}_{X}$ charges. By implementing an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
symmetry the Yukawa coupling terms are suited in such a way that the fermion
mass hierarchy is obtained without fine-tuning. The neutrino sector include
Majorana fermions to implement inverse see-saw mechanism. The effective mass
matrix for SM neutrinos is fitted to current neutrino oscillation data to check
the consistency of the model with experimental evidence, obtaining that the
normal-ordering scheme is preferred over the inverse ones and the values of the
neutrino Yukawa coupling constants are shown. Finally, the $h\rightarrow
\tau\mu$ lepton-flavor-violation process is addressed with the rotation
matrices of the CP-even scalars, left- and right-handed charged leptons,
yielding definite regions where the model is consistent with CMS reports of
$\mathrm{BR}(h\rightarrow \tau\mu)$.

because of the diffraction limit and low signal to noise ratio. We propose a
novel methodology to solve this type of inverse problems based on an idea from
plasmonic sensing. By using the field interaction with a known plasmonic
particle, the fine detail information of the small object can be encoded into
the shift of the resonant frequencies of the two particle system in the far

exactly the generalized polarization tensors associated with the small object,
from which one can perform the reconstruction. Our theoretical findings are
supplemented by a variety of numerical results. The results in the paper also

many different programs correspond to the same input-output behavior. The
upshot of yet another model of computation is that a categorical formalism
should provide a much needed high level language for theory of computation,
flexible enough to allow abstracting away the low level implementation details
when they are irrelevant, or taking them into account when they are genuinely
needed. A salient feature of the approach through monoidal categories is the
formal graphical language of string diagrams, which supports visual reasoning

  In the present paper, we provide a coalgebraic characterization of monoidal
computer. It turns out that the availability of interpreters and specializers,
that make a monoidal category into a monoidal computer, is equivalent with the
existence of a *universal state space*, that carries a weakly final state
machine for any pair of input and output types. Being able to program state
machines in monoidal computers allows us to represent Turing machines, to
capture their execution, count their steps, as well as, e.g., the memory cells

convenient diagrammatic language for studying computability and complexity.

gather critical insight consists in finding sizable numbers of GC progenitors

time corresponding to GC ages (~12.5 Gyr, or z ~ 5). This opportunity is
quantitatively explored, calculating how many GCPs could be detected by deep
imaging in the optical, near-IR and mid-IR bands. For concreteness, for the
imaging camera performances those of NIRCam on board of JWST are adopted. The
number of GCPs that could be detected scales linearly with their mass, i.e., on
how much more massive GCPs were compared to their GC progeny, and perspectives
look promising. Besides providing direct evidence on GC formation, the
detection of GCPs, their clustering, with or without a central galaxy already
in place, would shed light on the relative timing of GC formation and galaxy
growth and assembly. All this, may be the result of dedicated observations as
well as a side benefit of deep imaging meant to search for the agents of cosmic

prescribed tangents, with a specified bound on its curvature. Its structure, as
proved by Dubins in 1957 nearly 70 years after Markov posed the problem of
finding it, is elegantly simple: a selection of at most three arcs are
concatenated, each of which is either a circular arc of maximum (prescribed)
curvature or a straight line. The Markov-Dubins problem and its variants have
since been extensively studied in practical and theoretical settings. A
reformulation of the Markov-Dubins problem as an optimal control problem was
subsequently studied by various researchers using the Pontryagin maximum
principle and additional techniques, to reproduce Dubins' result. In the
present paper, we study the same reformulation, and apply the maximum
principle, with new insights, to derive Dubins' result again. We prove that
abnormal control solutions, which were ruled out in previous studies, do exist.
We characterize them as a concatenation of at most two circular arcs and show
that they are also solutions of the normal problem. More importantly, we prove
that any feasible path of the types mentioned above is a stationary solution,
i.e., that it satisfies the Pontryagin maximum principle. We propose a
numerical method for computing Markov-Dubins path. We illustrate the theory and
the numerical approach by three qualitatively different examples.

found that the four-quark condensates give dominant contributions. As the
density dependences of the four-quark condensates are not known well, we
examine two hypotheses. One is based on the factorization hypothesis (F-type)
and the other is derived from the perturbative chiral quark model (QM-type).
The F-type strongly depends on density, while the QM-type gives a weaker
dependence. It is found that, for the F-type dependence, the energy of
$\Lambda_c$ increases as the density of nuclear matter grows, that is,
$\Lambda_c$ feels repulsion. On the other hand, the QM-type predicts a weak
attraction ($\sim 20$ MeV at the normal nuclear density) for $\Lambda_c$ in
nuclear matter. We carry out a similar analysis of the $\Lambda$ hyperon and
find that the F-type density dependence is too strong to explain the observed
binding energy of $\Lambda$ in nuclei. Thus we conclude that the weak density
dependence of the four-quark condensate is more realistic. The scalar and
vector self-energies of $\Lambda_c$ for the QM-type dependence are found to be
much smaller than those of the light baryons.

extension of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation. This 3D relation identifies
a GRB fundamental plane whose existence we here confirm. We extend the original

afterglow plateaus and known redshifts. We compare several GRB categories, such
as shorts with extended emission, SEE, X-ray Flashes, GRBs associated with SNe,
a sample of only long-duration GRBs (132), selected from the total sample by
excluding GRBs of the previous categories, and the gold sample, composed by
GRBs with light curves with good data coverage and relatively flat plateaus.
The relation planes for each of these categories are not statistically
different from the gold fundamental plane, with the exception of the SEE, which
are hence identified as a physically distinct class of objects. The gold
fundamental plane has an intrinsic scatter smaller than any plane derived from
the other sample categories. Thus, the distance of any particular GRB category
from this plane becomes a key parameter. Additionally, we tested this 3D
relations by using GRBs observed at high energy, namely the peak luminosity
values derived by the Fermi-Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The 3D relation is
also confirmed for GRBs observed by the GBM, thus showing its independence from
the energy range. Furthermore, we computed the several category planes with T*a

separation larger than 40 GHz (312.7 pm at 1531 nm). It propagates through
three nonlinear fibres. The first fibre serves to pulse shape the initial
sinusoidal-square pulse, while a strong pulse compression down to sub-100 fs
takes place in the second fibre which is an amplifying erbium-doped fibre. The
last stage is a low-dispersion highly nonlinear fibre where the frequency comb
bandwidth is increased and the line intensity is equalised. We model this
system using the generalised nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation and investigate
it in terms of fibre lengths, fibre dispersion, laser frequency separation and
input powers with the aim to minimise the frequency comb noise. With the
support of the numerical results, a frequency comb is experimentally generated,
first in the near infra-red and then it is frequency-doubled into the visible
spectral range. Using a MUSE-type spectrograph, we evaluate the comb
performance for astronomical wavelength calibration in terms of equidistancy of
the comb lines and their stability.

an appropriate state of optical pulses is generated and subsequently moulded in
the second step delivering the desired OFC. More precisely, the first step is
realised by injection of two continuous-wave (CW) lasers into a conventional
single-mode fibre, whereas the second step generates a broad OFC by using the
optical solitons generated in step one as initial condition. We investigate the
conversion of a bichromatic input wave produced by two initial CW lasers into a
train of optical solitons, which happens in the fibre used as step one.
Especially, we are interested in the soliton content of the pulses created in
this fibre. For that, we study different initial conditions (a single
cosine-hump, an Akhmediev breather, and a deeply modulated bichromatic wave) by
means of soliton radiation beat analysis and compare the results to draw
conclusion about the soliton content of the state generated in the first step.
In case of a deeply modulated bichromatic wave, we observed the formation of a
collective soliton crystal for low input powers and the appearance of separated
solitons for high input powers. An intermediate state showing the features of
both, the soliton crystal and the separated solitons, turned out to be most
suitable for the generation of OFC for the purpose of calibration of
astronomical spectrographs.

However, Fukunaga, and Takahashi defined and studied functions that play the
role of curvature functions of a Legendre curve, and whose ratio extend the
curvature notion in the usual sense. Going into the same direction, our paper
is devoted to the extension of the concept of circular curvature from regular
to Legendre curves, but additionally referring not only to the Euclidean plane.
For the first time we will extend the concept of Legendre curves to normed
planes. Generalizing in such a way the results of the mentioned authors, we
define new functions that play the role of circular curvature of Legendre
curves, and tackle questions concerning existence, uniqueness, and invariance
under isometries for them. Using these functions, we study evolutes, involutes,
and pedal curves of Legendre curves for normed planes, and the notion of
contact between such curves is correspondingly extended, too. We also provide
new ways to calculate the Maslov index of a front in terms of our new curvature
functions. It becomes clear that an inner product is not necessary in
developing the theory of Legendre curves. More precisely, only a fixed norm and
the associated orthogonality (of Birkhoff type) are necessary.

aligned and the concentric structure represents a fixed-point phenomenon of the
Euler equations. Exception occurs in the rotating frame when a flow holds
inertial period and skew center becomes possible. Properties of stagnation
points based on Morse theory are obtained, leading to a topological explanation
of vertical alignment via pressure Hessian. The study thus uncovers a new
aspect of vortex behavior in ideal fluid that requires vortex center to align
with the direction of gravity when vortex evolution reaches a laminar end state
characterized by steady pseudo-plane velocities. Though the phenomenon arises
from the constraint of the Euler equations, under specific conditions the
topological theory is applicable to viscous fluid and explains the curvilinear

of cholesteric materials exhibits unprecedented structural complexity, with
confinement-drivenordering transitions between at least three types of nematic

the relay opportunistically transmits its own information to the destination
covertly on top of forwarding the source's message, while the source tries to

agents with limited local state interact randomly, and cooperate to
collectively compute global predicates. An extensive series of papers, across
different communities, has examined the computability and complexity
characteristics of this model. Majority, or consensus, is a central task, in
which agents need to collectively reach a decision as to which one of two
states $A$ or $B$ had a higher initial count. Two complexity metrics are
important: the time that a protocol requires to stabilize to an output
decision, and the state space size that each agent requires.
  It is known that majority requires $\Omega(\log \log n)$ states per agent to
allow for poly-logarithmic time stabilization, and that $O(\log^2 n)$ states
are sufficient. Thus, there is an exponential gap between the upper and lower
bounds.
  We address this question. We provide a new lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$
states for any protocol which stabilizes in $O( n^{1-c} )$ time, for any $c >
0$ constant. This result is conditional on basic monotonicity and output
assumptions, satisfied by all known protocols. Technically, it represents a
significant departure from previous lower bounds. Instead of relying on dense
configurations, we introduce a new surgery technique to construct executions
which contradict the correctness of algorithms that stabilize too fast.
Subsequently, our lower bound applies to general initial configurations.
  We give an algorithm for majority which uses $O(\log n)$ states, and
stabilizes in $O(\log^2 n)$ time. Central to the algorithm is a new leaderless
phase clock, which allows nodes to synchronize in phases of $\Theta(n \log{n})$
consecutive interactions using $O(\log n)$ states per node. We also employ our
phase clock to build a leader election algorithm with $O(\log n )$ states,
which stabilizes in $O(\log^2 n)$ time.

subset $\sigma\subseteq X$ as a simplex whenever the diameter of $\sigma$ is
less than $r$ (resp. at most $r$). Though Vietoris-Rips complexes have been
studied at small choices of scale by Hausmann and Latschev, they are not
well-understood at larger scale parameters. In this paper we investigate the
homotopy types of Vietoris-Rips complexes of ellipses $Y=\{(x,y)\in
\mathbb{R}^2~|~(x/a)^2+y^2=1\}$ of small eccentricity, meaning
$1<a\le\sqrt{2}$. Indeed, we show there are constants $r_1 < r_2$ such that for
all $r_1 < r< r_2$, we have $VR_<(X;r)\simeq S^2$ and $VR_\leq(X;r)\simeq
\bigvee^5 S^2$, though only one of the two-spheres in $VR_\leq(X;r)$ is
persistent. Furthermore, we show that for any scale parameter $r_1 < r < r_2$,
there are arbitrarily dense subsets of the ellipse such that the Vietoris-Rips
complex of the subset is not homotopy equivalent to the Vietoris-Rips complex
of the entire ellipse. As our main tool we link these homotopy types to the
structure of infinite cyclic graphs.

hidden behind large amounts of extinction. We thus utilised the deep high
resolution near infrared surveys UGPS and VVV to uncover so far unknown compact
clusters and to analyse their properties.
  Images of all objects in the area covered by these two surveys, and which are
listed as Galaxy in SIMBAD have been inspected and 125 so far unknown stellar
clusters and candidate clusters have been identified. Based on the frequent
associations with star formation indicators (nebulosities, IRAS sources, Hii
regions, masers) we find that the typical cluster in our sample is young, at
distances between 1-10kpc and has a typical apparent radius of 25arcsec. We
suggest more systematic searches e.g. at all positions of 2MASS extended
sources to increase the completeness of the known cluster sample beyond

variance reduction gradient (SVRG), where hereafter we refer to as the variance
reduced stochastic gradient descent (VR-SGD). Different from the choices of the
snapshot point and starting point in SVRG and its proximal variant, Prox-SVRG,
the two vectors of each epoch in VR-SGD are set to the average and last iterate
of the previous epoch, respectively. This setting allows us to use much larger
learning rates or step sizes than SVRG, e.g., 3/(7L) for VR-SGD vs 1/(10L) for
SVRG, and also makes our convergence analysis more challenging. In fact, a
larger learning rate enjoyed by VR-SGD means that the variance of its
stochastic gradient estimator asymptotically approaches zero more rapidly.
Unlike common stochastic methods such as SVRG and proximal stochastic methods
such as Prox-SVRG, we design two different update rules for smooth and
non-smooth objective functions, respectively. In other words, VR-SGD can tackle
non-smooth and/or non-strongly convex problems directly without using any
reduction techniques such as quadratic regularizers. Moreover, we analyze the
convergence properties of VR-SGD for strongly convex problems, which show that
VR-SGD attains a linear convergence rate. We also provide the convergence
guarantees of VR-SGD for non-strongly convex problems. Experimental results
show that the performance of VR-SGD is significantly better than its
counterparts, SVRG and Prox-SVRG, and it is also much better than the best
known stochastic method, Katyusha.

to a family of congruences in asymptotically flat-spaces as `Almost

provide strong evidence that the upper transition at $p=6$ is indeed of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type in contrast to the claim of the
previous Fisher zero study [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{80}, 042103 (2009)]. We find
that the leading zeros of $p=6$ at the upper transition collapse onto the zero
trajectories of the larger $p$'s including the $XY$ limit while the finite-size
behavior of $p=5$ differs from the converged behavior of $p \ge 6$ within the
system sizes examined. In addition, we argue that the nondivergent specific
heat in the BKT transition is responsible for the small partition function
magnitude that decreases exponentially with increasing system size near the
leading zero, fundamentally limiting access to large systems in search for
zeros with an estimator under finite statistical fluctuations.

However, traditional approaches to symbolic regression require the use of
protected operators, which can lead to perverse model characteristics and poor
generalisation. In this paper, we revisit interval arithmetic as one possible
solution to allow genetic programming to perform regression using unprotected
operators. Using standard benchmarks, we show that using interval arithmetic
within model evaluation does not prevent invalid solutions from entering the
population, meaning that search performance remains compromised. We extend the
basic interval arithmetic concept with `safe' search operators that integrate
interval information into their process, thereby greatly reducing the number of
invalid solutions produced during search. The resulting algorithms are able to
more effectively identify good models that generalise well to unseen data. We
conclude with an analysis of the sensitivity of interval arithmetic-based
operators with respect to the accuracy of the supplied input feature intervals.

the dominating radiative decay, the remaining exciton density, which has been
scattered from the initially excited bright radiative state into dark states of

slower dynamics, covering 10ps to 10ns timescales. This includes direct bright
transitions with larger in-plane momentum, as well as indirect dark transitions

definite (SPD) linear systems resulting from the discretization of general
elliptic PDEs, or the spatial discretization of parabolic PDEs. However,
convergence theory and most variations of AMG rely on $A$ being SPD. Hyperbolic
PDEs, which arise often in large-scale scientific simulations, remain a
challenge for AMG, as well as other fast linear solvers, in part because the
resulting linear systems are often highly nonsymmetric. Here, a novel
convergence framework is developed for nonsymmetric, reduction-based AMG, and
sufficient conditions derived for $\ell^2$-convergence of error and residual.
In particular, classical multigrid approximation properties are connected with
reduction-based measures to develop a robust framework for nonsymmetric,
reduction-based AMG.
  Matrices with block-triangular structure are then recognized as being
amenable to reduction-type algorithms, and a reduction-based AMG method is
developed for upwind discretizations of hyperbolic PDEs, based on the concept
of a Neumann approximation to ideal restriction ($n$AIR). $n$AIR can be seen as
a variation of local AIR ($\ell$AIR) introduced in previous work, specifically
targeting matrices with triangular structure. Although less versatile than
$\ell$AIR, setup times for $n$AIR can be substantially faster for problems with
high connectivity. $n$AIR is shown to be an effective and scalable solver of
steady state transport for discontinuous, upwind discretizations, with
unstructured meshes, and up to 6th-order finite elements, offering a
significant improvement over existing AMG methods. $n$AIR is also shown to be
effective on several classes of `nearly triangular' matrices, resulting from
curvilinear finite elements and artificial diffusion.

reachability, B\""uchi, omega-regular or more general objectives.
  These games are known to be weakly determined, i.e., they have value.
However, strong determinacy of threshold objectives (given by an event and a
threshold $c \in [0,1]$) was open in many cases: is it always the case that the
maximizer or the minimizer has a winning strategy, i.e., one that enforces,
against all strategies of the other player, that the objective is satisfied
with probability $\ge c$ (resp. $< c$)?
  We show that almost-sure objectives (where $c=1$) are strongly determined.
This vastly generalizes a previous result on finite games with almost-sure tail
objectives. On the other hand we show that $\ge 1/2$ (co-)B\""uchi objectives
are not strongly determined, not even if the game is finitely branching.
  Moreover, for almost-sure reachability and almost-sure B\""uchi objectives in
finitely branching games, we strengthen strong determinacy by showing that one

reduce the backhaul load for the distributed antenna systems. Finding the
optimal coefficients in C&F has commonly been treated as a shortest vector
problem (SVP), which is N-P hard. The point of our work and of Sahraei's recent
work is that the C&F coefficient problem can be much simpler. Due to the
special structure of C&F, some low polynomial complexity optimal algorithms
have recently been developed. However these methods can be applied to real
valued channels and integer based lattices only. In this paper, we consider the
complex valued channel with complex integer based lattices. For the first time,
we propose a low polynomial complexity algorithm to find the optimal solution
for the complex scenario. Then we propose a simple linear search algorithm
which is conceptually suboptimal, however numerical results show that the
performance degradation is negligible compared to the optimal method. Both
algorithms are suitable for lattices over any algebraic integers, and
significantly outperform the lattice reduction algorithm. The complexity of
both algorithms are investigated both theoretically and numerically. The
results show that our proposed algorithms achieve better performance-complexity
trade-offs compared to the existing algorithms.

individual waves in the group. From this an expression for complex phase speed
of individual waves is calculated. It is deduced that each wave in a group does
not grow at the same rate. It is shown that the critical layer is no longer
symmetrical compared with the ideal monochromatic waves. This asymmetry causes
the critical layer height to be lower over the downwind part. Therefore the
positive growth of the individual waves on the upwind part of the wave group
exceeds the negative growth on the downwind part (which would not be true if
$z_c$, where the mean flow $U$ is equal to the speed of the wave propagation,
was the same over the whole group). This leads to the critical layer group
effect producing a net horizontal force on the waves, in addition to the
sheltering effect. Computational simulations over a non-growing wave group is
also presented, which confirms the above postulation made by Sajjadi, Hunt and

Nd, Eu; y = 0.4, 0.2) introduces unidirectional charge density waves (CDWs) of
incommensurability delta_c(x) in domains of the CuO_2 planes. A periodic
structure, each CDW gives rise to a Bragg-reflection mirror of extension
delta_c(x) that attaches to a nodal point \.{Q} on the planar diagonal in
reciprocal space. This confines itinerant holes to a Fermi arc about \.{Q},
leaving a pseudogap along the remainder of the underlying Fermi surface. The
length of the Fermi arc and the magnitude of the pseudogap both are determined
by \delta_c(x). The pseudogap closes when the Fermi arc reaches the antinodal
symmetry points M. This is the case at a doping level x^*_0 = 0.182 for
La_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4 at T=0 (quantum critical point, QCP) and otherwise at a
doping-dependent pseudogap temperature T^*(x) that marks the boundary between
the compounds' pseudogap phase and strange-metal phase. The different value of
the observed QCP in La_{2-y-x}Ln_ySr_xCuO_4, x^*_0 = 0.235, is attributed to
extra magnetic order from Ln^{3+} ions with a finite magnetic moment instead of
La^{3+} with none. The possibility of quantum oscillations in
La_{2-y-x}Ln_ySr_xCuO_4 in the high-end doping interval of their pseudogap
phase, 0.182 < x < 0.235, is raised. The strange-metal phase is interpreted as
a consequence of conflicting Bragg reflection conditions for the crystals'
itinerant charge carriers when boundaries of the BZ and the CDW mirrors
coincide, frustrating umklapp processes of carrier-carrier scattering.

pricing model. If the market is information efficient, the proposed strategy
will mimic the market; otherwise, the strategy will outperform the market. The
strategy depends on the selection of a portfolio via Bayesian multiple testing
methodologies. We present the ""discrete-mixture prior"" model and the
""hierarchical Bayes model with horseshoe prior."" We define the Oracle set and
prove that asymptotically the Bayes rule attains the risk of Bayes Oracle up to
$O(1)$. Our proposed Bayes Oracle test guarantees statistical power by
providing the upper bound of the type-II error. Simulation study indicates that
the proposed Bayes oracle test is suitable for the efficient market with few
stocks inefficiently priced. However, as the model becomes dense, i.e., the
market is highly inefficient, one should not use the Bayes oracle test. The
statistical power of the Bayes Oracle portfolio is uniformly better for the
$k$-factor model ($k>1$) than the one factor CAPM. We present the empirical
study, where we considered the 500 constituent stocks of S\&P 500 from the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and S\&P 500 index as the benchmark for thirteen
years from the year 2006 to 2018. We showed the out-sample risk and return
performance of the four different portfolio selection strategies and compared
with the S\&P 500 index as the benchmark market index. Empirical results
indicate that it is possible to propose a strategy which can outperform the
market.

"1705.07989","Shouhong Wang","Ming Cai, Marco Hernandez, KiahWah Ong, Shouhong Wang","Baroclinic Instability and Transitions in a Two-Layer Quasigeostrophic
  Channel Model",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main objective of this article is to derive a mathematical theory
associated with the nonlinear stability and dynamic transitions of the basic
shear flows associated with baroclinic instability, which plays a fundamental
role in the dominant mechanism shaping the cyclones and anticyclones that
dominate weather in mid-latitudes, as well as the mesoscale eddies that play
various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of tracers. This article
provides a general transition and stability theory for the two-layer
quasi-geostrophic model originally derived by Pedlosky \cite{ped1970}. We show
that the instability and dynamic transition of the basic shear flow occur only
when the Froude number $F>(\gamma^2+1)/2$, where $\gamma$ is the weave number
of lowest zonal harmonic. In this case, we derive a precise critical shear
velocity $U_c$ and a dynamic transition number $b$, and we show that the
dynamic transition and associated flo0w patterns are dictated by the sign of
this transition number. In particular, we show that for $b>0$, the system
undergoes a continuous transition, leading to spatiotemporal flow oscillatory
patterns as the shear velocity $U$ crosses $U_c$; for $b<0$, the system
undergoes a jump transition, leading to drastic change and more complex
transition patterns in the far field, and to unstable period solutions for
$U<U_c$. Furthermore, we show that when the wavenumber of the zonal harmonic
$\gamma=1$, the transition number $b$ is always positive and the system always
undergoes a continuous dynamic transition leading spatiotemporal oscillations.
This suggests that a continuous transition to spatiotemporal patterns is
preferable for the shear flow associated with baroclinic instability.
