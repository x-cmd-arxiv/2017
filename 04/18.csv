localization and mapping systems (SLAM); it enables robots to produce a
consistent map by recognizing previously visited places. When robots operate
over extended periods, robustness to viewpoint and condition changes as well as
satisfactory real-time performance become essential requirements for a
practical LCD system.
  This paper presents an approach to directly utilize the outputs at the
intermediate layer of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as image
descriptors. The matching location is determined by matching the image
sequences through a method called SeqCNNSLAM. The utility of SeqCNNSLAM is
comprehensively evaluated in terms of viewpoint and condition invariance.
Experiments show that SeqCNNSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art LCD systems, such
as SeqSLAM and Change Removal, in most cases. To allow for the real-time
performance of SeqCNNSLAM, an acceleration method, A-SeqCNNSLAM, is
established. This method exploits the location relationship between the
matching images of adjacent images to reduce the matching range of the current
image. Results demonstrate that acceleration of 4-6 is achieved with minimal
accuracy degradation, and the method's runtime satisfies the real-time demand.
To extend the applicability of A-SeqCNNSLAM to new environments, a method
called O-SeqCNNSLAM is established for the online adjustment of the parameters
of A-SeqCNNSLAM.

been an active research area due to its wide applications. Inspired by the
success of deep neural networks (DNN), we propose a DNN-based approach for
End-to-End 3D FAce Reconstruction (UH-E2FAR) from a single 2D image. Different
from recent works that reconstruct and refine the 3D face in an iterative
manner using both an RGB image and an initial 3D facial shape rendering, our
DNN model is end-to-end, and thus the complicated 3D rendering process can be
avoided. Moreover, we integrate in the DNN architecture two components, namely
a multi-task loss function and a fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) to
improve facial expression reconstruction. With the multi-task loss function, 3D
face reconstruction is divided into neutral 3D facial shape reconstruction and
expressive 3D facial shape reconstruction. The neutral 3D facial shape is
class-specific. Therefore, higher layer features are useful. In comparison, the
expressive 3D facial shape favors lower or intermediate layer features. With
the fusion-CNN, features from different intermediate layers are fused and
transformed for predicting the 3D expressive facial shape. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework in
improving the accuracy of 3D face reconstruction.

and gravitational anomalies in the presence of the three RHNs. We introduce a
$Z_2$-parity in the model, under which an odd-parity is assigned to one RHN,
while all the other particles is assigned to be $Z_2$-even, and hence the
$Z_2$-odd RHN serves as a DM candidate. In this model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry
is radiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, by which the
electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered. There are three free parameters in
our model, the U(1)' charge of the SM Higgs doublet ($x_H$), the new U(1)'
gauge coupling ($g_X$), and the U(1)' gauge boson ($Z'$) mass ($m_{Z'}$), which
are severely constrained in order to solve the electroweak vacuum instability
problem, and satisfy the LHC Run-2 bounds from the search for $Z'$ boson
resonance. In addition to these constraints, we investigate the RHN DM physics.
Because of the nature of classical conformality, we find that a RHN DM pair
mainly annihilates into the SM particles through the $Z'$ boson exchange. This
is the so-called $Z'$-portal DM scenario. Combining the electroweak vacuum
stability condition, the LHC Run-2 bounds, and the cosmological constraint from
the observed DM relic density, we find that all constrains complementarily work
to narrow down the allowed parameter regions, and, especially, exclude $m_{Z'}
\lesssim 3.5$ TeV. For the obtained allowed regions, we calculate the
spin-independent cross section of the RHN DM with nucleons. We find that the
resultant cross section well below the current experimental upper bounds.

a pricing problem, i.e., it is a menu of lotteries. In this paper we show that
under a natural regularity condition on the probability distributions, which we
call \emph{decreasing marginal revenue}, the optimal pricing is in fact
\emph{deterministic}. It is a price curve, offering $i$ units of the item for a
price of $p_i$, for every integer $i$. Further, we show that the revenue as a
function of the prices $p_i$ is a \emph{concave} function, which implies that
the optimum price curve can be found in polynomial time. This gives a rare

characteristic of the TESSA scheme is a high intensity seed pulse which
provides high gradient beam deceleration and efficient energy extraction. In
the oscillator configuration, the TESSA undulator is driven by a high

beam-splitter is used for outcoupling a fraction of the amplified power and

The mirrors in the oscillator cavity refocus the seed at the undulator entrance

dimensions with arbitrary signs of couplings has been considered. Systematic
analysis of the action with arbitrary signs of couplings in lorentzian flat
space-time for no-tachyons, fixes the signs. Feynman $+i\epsilon$ prescription
for these sign further grants necessary convergence in path-integral,
suppressing the field modes with large action. This also leads to a sensible
wick rotation where quantum computation can be performed. Running couplings for
these sign of parameters makes the massive tensor ghost innocuous leading to a
stable and ghost-free renormalizable theory in four space-time dimensions. The
theory has a transition point arising from renormalisation group (RG)
equations, where the coefficient of $R^2$ diverges without affecting the
perturbative quantum field theory. Redefining this coefficient gives a better
handle over the theory around the transition point. The flow equations pushes
the flow of parameters across the transition point. The flow beyond the
transition point is analysed using the one-loop RG equations which shows that
the regime beyond the transition point has unphysical properties: there are
tachyons, the path-integral loses positive definiteness, Newton's constant $G$
becomes negative and large, and perturbative parameters become large. These
shortcomings indicate a lack of completeness beyond the transition point and
need of a non-perturbative treatment of the theory beyond the transition point.

appropriate latent variables in order to enable efficient fitting to dynamic

finite slip at the particle surface present in MD simulations. It was further
demonstrated that diffusion of Janus particles is markedly different from that
of uniform particles; namely, Janus particles preferentially rotate and orient
their nonwetting sides along the displacement vector to reduce drag. This

heavy vector mesons inside a plasma at finite temperature and density. The
meson dissociation in the medium is represented by the decrease in the height
of the spectral function peaks. In order to find a description for the
evolution of the quasi-states with temperature and chemical potential it is
crucial to use a model that is consistent with the decay constant behavior. The
reason is that the height of a spectral function peak is related to the value
of the zero temperature decay constant of the corresponding particle. AdS/QCD
holographic models are in general not consistent with the observation that
decay constants of heavy vector mesons decrease with radial excitation level.
However, it was recently shown that using a soft wall background and
calculating the correlation functions at a finite position of anti-de Sitter
space, associated with an ultraviolet energy scale, it is possible to describe
the observed behavior. Here we extend this proposal to the case of finite
temperature $T $ and chemical potential $\mu $. A clear picture of the
dissociation of bottomonium states as a function of $ \mu $ and $T$ emerges
from the spectral function. The energy scales where the change in chemical
potential leads to changes in the thermal properties of the mesons is
consistent with QCD expectations.

theorem for oracles in such theories which is a necessary condition for the
oracle to be well-defined. The three principles are: causality (roughly, no
signalling from the future), purification (each mixed state arises as the
marginal of a pure state of a larger system), and strong symmetry existence of
non-trivial reversible transformations). Sorkin has defined a hierarchy of
conceivable interference behaviours, where the order in the hierarchy
corresponds to the number of paths that have an irreducible interaction in a
multi-slit experiment. Given our oracle model, we show that if a classical
computer requires at least n queries to solve a learning problem, then the
corresponding lower bound in theories lying at the kth level of Sorkin's
hierarchy is n/k. Hence, lower bounds on the number of queries to a quantum
oracle needed to solve certain problems are not optimal in the space of all
generalised probabilistic theories, although it is not yet known whether the
optimal bounds are achievable in general. Hence searches for higher-order
interference are not only foundationally motivated, but constitute a search for
a computational resource beyond that offered by quantum computation.

(SLSN-I), iPTF15esb and iPTF16bad, showing late-time H-alpha emission with line
luminosities of (1-3)e+41 erg/s and velocity widths of (4000-6000) km/s.
Including the previously published iPTF13ehe, this makes up a total of three
such events to date. iPTF13ehe is one of the most luminous and the slowest
evolving SLSNe-I, whereas the other two are less luminous and fast decliners.
We interpret this as a result of the ejecta running into a neutral H-shell
located at a radius of ~ 1.0e+16cm. This implies that violent mass loss must
have occurred several decades before the supernova explosion. Such a short time
interval suggests that eruptive mass loss could be common shortly prior to the
death of a massive star as a SLSN. And more importantly, helium is unlikely to
be completely stripped off the progenitor stars and could be present in the
ejecta. It is a mystery why helium features are not detected, even though
non-thermal energy sources, capable of ionizing He atoms, may exist as
suggested by the O II absorption series in the early time spectra. At late
times (+240d), our spectra appear to have intrinsically lower [O I]6300A
luminosities than that of SN2015bn and SN2007bi, possibly an indication of
smaller oxygen masses (<10-30Msun). The blue-shifted H-alpha emission relative
to the hosts for all three events may be in tension with the binary star model
proposed for iPTF13ehe. Finally, iPTF15esb has a peculiar light curve with
three peaks separated from one another by ~ 22 days. The LC undulation is
higher in bluer bands. One possible explanation is eject-CSM interaction.

the surrounding plasma via two electrical circuits, each connecting to the star
over a small region known as a ""polar cap."" For a dipole-magnetized star, the
polar caps coincide with the magnetic poles (hence the name), but in general,
they can occur at any place and take any shape. In light of their crucial
importance to most models of pulsar emission (from radio to X-ray to wind), we
develop a general technique for determining polar cap properties. We consider a
perfectly conducting star surrounded by a force-free magnetosphere and include
the effects of general relativity. Using a combined numerical-analytical
technique that leverages the rotation rate as a small parameter, we derive a
general analytic formula for the polar cap shape and charge-current
distribution as a function of the stellar mass, radius, rotation rate, moment
of inertia, and magnetic field. We present results for dipole and quadrudipole
fields (superposed dipole and quadrupole) inclined relative to the axis of
rotation. The inclined dipole polar cap results are the first to include
general relativity, and they confirm its essential role in the pulsar problem.
The quadrudipole pulsar illustrates the phenomenon of thin annular polar caps.
More generally, our method lays a foundation for detailed modeling of pulsar
emission with realistic magnetic fields.

the solar neighborhood are a fundamental anchor for studies of the initial mass
function, stellar evolution, and galactic structure. Using data from the Gaia
DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, we reconstruct Gaia's selection function
and we determine Gaia's volume completeness, the local number density, and the
vertical profiles of different spectral types along the main sequence from
early A stars to late K stars as well as along the giant branch. We clearly
detect the expected flattening of the stellar density profile near the
mid-plane for all stellar types: All vertical profiles are well represented by
sech^2 profiles, with scale heights ranging from ~50 pc for A stars to ~150 pc
for G and K dwarfs and giants. We determine the luminosity function along the
main sequence for M_V < 7 (M >~ $0.72 M_\odot$) and along the giant branch for
M_J >~ -2.5. Converting this to a mass function, we find that the high-mass (M
> $1\,M_\odot$) present-day mass function along the main sequence is d n / d M
= 0.016 $(M/M_\odot)^{-4.7}$ stars/pc^3/$M_\odot$. Extrapolating below M =
$0.72\,M_\odot$, we find a total mid-plane stellar density of 0.040+/-0.002
$M_\odot$/pc^3. Giants contribute 0.00039+/-0.00001 stars/pc^3 or about
0.00046+/-0.00005 $M_\odot$/pc^3. The star-formation rate surface density is
\Sigma(t) = 7+/-1 exp(-t/[7+/-1 Gyr]) $M_\odot$/pc^2/Gyr. Overall, we find that
Gaia DR1's selection biases are manageable and allow a detailed new inventory
of the solar neighborhood to be made that agrees with and extends previous
studies. This bodes well for mapping the Milky Way with the full Gaia data set.

of data. LOFAR, one of the Square Kilometre Array pathfinders, is already
producing data on a petabyte scale. The calibration of these data presents a
huge challenge for final users: a) extensive storage and computing resources
are required; b) the installation and maintenance of the processing software is
not trivial; and c) the requirements of (experimental) calibration pipelines
are quickly evolving. After encountering some limitations in classical
infrastructures, we investigated the viability of cloud infrastructures as a
solution. We found that the installation and operation of LOFAR data
calibration pipelines is not only possible, but can also be efficient in cloud
infrastructures. The main advantages were: (1) ease of software installation
and maintenance, and the availability of standard APIs and tools, widely used
in the industry; this reduces the requirement for significant manual
intervention, which can have a highly negative impact; (2) flexibility to adapt
the infrastructure to the needs of the problem, especially as those demands
change over time; (3) on-demand consumption of (shared) resources. We found no
significant impediments associated with the speed of data transfer, the use of
external block storage, or the memory available. However, the availability of
scratch storage areas of an appropriate size is critical. Finally, we
considered the cost-effectiveness of a commercial cloud like Amazon Web
Services. While it is more expensive than the operation of a large,
fully-utilised cluster completely dedicated to LOFAR data reduction, its costs
are competitive if the number of datasets to be analysed is not high, or if the
costs of maintaining the dedicated system become high. Coupled with the
advantages discussed above, this suggests that a cloud infrastructure may be
favourable for many users.

implementing different models of gravity. This suite includes a standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, two variations of $f(R)$-gravity, two variations of
Symmetron gravity and three Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) models. We use
the publicly available WND-CHARM algorithm to extract 2919 image features from
either the raw pixel intensities of the maps, or from a variety of image
transformations including Fourier, Wavelet, Chebyshev and Edge transformations.
After discarding the most degenerate models, we achieve more than 60%
single-image classification success rate in distinguishing the four different
models of gravity while using a simple weighted neighbour distance (WND) to
define our classification metric. This number can be increased to more than 70%
if additional information, such as a rough estimate of the halo mass, is
included. We find that the classification success steeply declines when the
noise level in the images is increased, but that this trend can be largely
reduced by smoothing the noisy data. We find Zernike moments of the Fourier
transformation of either the raw image or its Wavelet transformation to be the
most descriptive feature, followed by the Gini coefficient of several
transformations and the Haralick and Tamura textures of the raw pixel data
eventually pre-processed by an Edge transformation. The proposed methodology is
general and does not only apply to the characterisation of modified gravity
models, but can be used to classify any set of models which show variations in
the 2D morphology of their respective structure.

four-dimensional cosmological constant is set to zero by a dynamical
self-adjustment mechanism. The bulk contains Einstein gravity and a scalar
field. We study holographic RG flow solutions, with the standard model brane
separating an infinite volume UV region and an IR region of finite volume. For
generic values of the brane vacuum energy, regular solutions exist such that
the four-dimensional brane is flat. Its position in the bulk is determined
dynamically by the junction conditions. Analysis of linear fluctuations shows
that a regime of 4-dimensional gravity is possible at large distances, due to
the presence of an induced gravity term. The graviton acquires an effective
mass, and a five-dimensional regime may exist at large and/or small scales. We
show that, for a broad choice of potentials, flat-brane solutions are
manifestly stable and free of ghosts. We compute the scalar contribution to the
force between brane-localized sources and show that, in certain models, the
vDVZ discontinuity is absent and the effective interaction at short distances
is mediated by two transverse graviton helicities.

  Abstract abridged for arXiv submission",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1054",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  [abridged] In the typical giant-impact scenario for the Moon formation most
of the Moon's material originates from the impactor. Any Earth-impactor
composition difference should, therefore, correspond to a comparable Earth-Moon
composition difference. Analysis of Moon rocks shows a close Earth-Moon
composition similarity, posing a challenge for the giant-impact scenario, given
that impactors were thought to significantly differ in composition from the
planets they impact. Here we use a large set of 140 simulations to show that
the composition of impactors could be very similar to that of the planets they
impact; in $4.9\%$-$18.2\%$ ($1.9\%$-$6.7\%$) of the cases the resulting
composition of the Moon is consistent with the observations of
$\Delta^{17}O<15$ ($\Delta^{17}O<6$ ppm). These findings suggest that the
Earth-Moon composition similarity could be resolved as to arise from the
primordial Earth-impactor composition similarity. Note that although we find
the likelihood for the suggested competing model of very high mass-ratio
impacts (producing significant Earth-impactor composition mixing) is comparable
($<6.7\%$), this scenario also requires additional fine-tuned requirements of a
very fast spinning Earth. Using the same simulations we also explore the
composition of giant-impact formed Mars-moons as well as Vesta-like asteroids.
We find that the Mars-moon composition difference should be large, but smaller
than expected if the moons are captured asteroids. Finally, we find that the
left-over planetesimals ('asteroids') in our simulations are frequently
scattered far away from their initial positions, thus potentially explaining
the mismatch between the current position and composition of the Vesta
asteroid.

in the strong amplification regime the noise undergoes four-mode squeezing, and
that in this regime the output signal to noise ratio can significantly exceed

and that it is likely accompanied by a small group of galaxies. Given the
density of the intra-cluster medium and the galaxy's mass, projected position
and velocity within the cluster, we estimate that JO201 must so far have lost
~50% of its gas during infall via RPS. The MUSE data indeed reveal a smooth
stellar disk, accompanied by large projected tails of ionised (Halpha) gas,
composed of kinematically cold (velocity dispersion <40km/s) star-forming knots
and very warm (>100km/s) diffuse emission which extend out to at least ~50 kpc
from the galaxy centre. The ionised Halpha-emitting gas in the disk rotates
with the stars out to ~6 kpc but in the disk outskirts becomes increasingly
redshifted with respect to the (undisturbed) stellar disk. The observed
disturbances are consistent with the presence of gas trailing behind the
stellar component, resulting from intense face-on RPS happening along the line
of sight. Our kinematic analysis is consistent with the estimated fraction of
lost gas, and reveals that stripping of the disk happens outside-in, causing
shock heating and gas compression in the stripped tails.

validate SINOPSIS, the spectral fitting code that will be used for the analysis

the spatial distribution and physical properties of gas and stellar populations
in this galaxy. We compare the model spectra to those obtained with GANDALF, a
code with similar features widely used to interpret the kinematic of stars and
gas in galaxies from IFU data. We find that SINOPSIS can reproduce the
pixel-by-pixel spectra of this galaxy at least as good as GANDALF does,
providing reliable estimates of the underlying stellar absorption to properly
correct the nebular gas emission. Using these results, we find strong evidences
of a double effect of ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium onto the
gas of the galaxy. A moderate burst of star formation, dating between 20 and
500 Myr ago and involving the outer parts of the galaxy more strongly than the
inner regions, was likely induced by a first interaction of the galaxy with the
intracluster medium. Stripping by ram pressure, plus probable gas depletion due
to star formation, contributed to create a truncated ionized gas disk. The
presence of an extended stellar tail on only one side of the disk, points
instead to another kind of process, likely a gravitational interaction by a
fly-by or a close encounter with another galaxy in the cluster.

thermalise at the very low densities found in many systems. Such nonthermal

tracked across Lorentz factor space and is evolved in space and time, in
parallel with thermal electrons, thermal ions, and radiation. In the present
study, for simplicity, energy injection into the nonthermal distribution is
taken as a fixed fraction of the local electron viscous heating rate. Numerical
results are presented for a model with a low mass accretion rate similar to
that of Sgr A*. We find that the presence of a nonthermal population of
electrons has negligible effect on the overall dynamics of the system. Due to
our simple uniform particle injection prescription, the radiative power in the
nonthermal simulation is enhanced at large radii. The energy distribution of
the nonthermal electrons shows a synchrotron cooling break, with the break
Lorentz factor varying with location and time, reflecting the complex interplay
between the local viscous heating rate, magnetic field strength, and fluid
velocity.

monopoles. In particular, the existence of micro-Gauss magnetic fields in
galaxy clusters and radio relics implies that the scales of these structures
are below the Debye screening length, thus setting an upper limit on the
cosmological density parameter of monopoles, $\Omega_M\lesssim3\times10^{-4}$,
which precludes them from being the dark matter. Future detection of Gpc-scale
coherent magnetic fields could improve this limit by a few orders of magnitude.
In addition, we predict the existence of magnetic Langmuir waves and turbulence
which may appear on the sky as ""zebra patterns"" of an alternating magnetic
field with ${\bf k\cdot B}\not=0$. We also show that magnetic monopole Langmuir
turbulence excited near the accretion shock of galaxy clusters may be an
efficient mechanism for generating the observed intracluster magnetic fields.

confidence intervals for low-dimensional components in a high-dimensional
model. The proposed estimator, called Constrained Lasso (CLasso) estimator, is
obtained by simultaneously solving two estimating equations---one imposing a
zero-bias constraint for the low-dimensional parameter and the other forming an
$\ell_1$-penalized procedure for the high-dimensional nuisance parameter. By
carefully choosing the zero-bias constraint, the resulting estimator of the low
dimensional parameter is shown to admit an asymptotically normal limit
attaining the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound in a semiparametric sense. We propose
a tuning-free iterative algorithm for implementing the CLasso. We show that
when the algorithm is initialized at the Lasso estimator, the de-sparsified
estimator proposed in van de Geer et al. [\emph{Ann. Statist.} {\bf 42} (2014)
1166--1202] is asymptotically equivalent to the first iterate of the algorithm.
We analyse the asymptotic properties of the CLasso estimator and show the
globally linear convergence of the algorithm. We also demonstrate encouraging
empirical performance of the CLasso through numerical studies.

correct, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the
corresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use
of non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and
could help improve the prediction of dynamical quantities from techniques that
use a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of

that the trigonal splitting of the t2g orbitals is -12 $\pm10$ meV, i.e.

the LABs. A radio excess in the submm/radio detected LABs is common, hinting at
the presence of active galactic nuclei. Most radio sources without X-ray
counterparts are located at the centers of the LABs. However, all X-ray
counterparts avoid the central regions. This may be explained by absorption due
to exceptionally large column densities along the line-of-sight or by LAB
morphologies, which are highly orientation dependent. The median Ly{\alpha}
escape fraction is about 3\% among the submm-detected LABs, which is lower than
a lower limit of 11\% for the submm-undetected LABs. We suspect that the large

strategies were compared. One series of Co(2 nm)/Cu(tCu) multilayers with tCu
ranging from 0.5 nm to 6 nm was produced with the conventional two-pulse
plating by using a galvanostatic/potentiostatic (G/P) pulse combination for the
magnetic/non-magnetic layer deposition, respectively, whereby the Cu layer
deposition was carried out at the electrochemically optimized potential.
Another Co(2 nm)/Cu(tCu) multilayer series with the same tCu range was prepared
with the help of a G/P/G pulse combination. In this latter case, first a
bilayer of Co(2 nm)/Cu(6 nm) was deposited in each cycle as in the G/P mode
after which a third G pulse was applied with a small anodic current to dissolve
part of the 6 nm thick Cu layer in order to ensure the targeted tCu value. The
comparison of the two series revealed that the G/P/G pulse combination yields
multilayers for which GMR can be obtained even at such low nominal Cu layer
thicknesses where G/P multilayers already exhibit bulk-like anisotropic
magnetoresistance only. Surface roughness measurements by atomic force
microscopy revealed that the two kinds of pulse combination yield different
surface roughness values which correlate with the structural quality of the
multilayers as indicated by the absence or presence of multilayer satellite
reflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns. The results of multilayer
chemical analysis revealed that mainly an increased Cu content of the magnetic
layer is responsible for the onset of SPM regions in the form of Co
segregations in the G/P/G multilayers with small Cu layer thicknesses.

The interference pattern formed in a multi-slit experiment is a function of the
interference patterns formed between pairs of slits, there are no genuinely new
features resulting from considering three slits instead of two. Sorkin has
introduced a hierarchy of mathematically conceivable higher-order interference
behaviours, where classical theory lies at the first level of this hierarchy
and quantum theory theory at the second. Informally, the order in this
hierarchy corresponds to the number of slits on which the interference pattern
has an irreducible dependence. Many authors have wondered why quantum
interference is limited to the second level of this hierarchy. Does the
existence of higher-order interference violate some natural physical principle
that we believe should be fundamental? In the current work we show that such
principles can be found which limit interference behaviour to second-order, or
""quantum-like"", interference, but that do not restrict us to the entire quantum
formalism. We work within the operational framework of generalised
probabilistic theories, and prove that any theory satisfying Causality, Purity
Preservation, Pure Sharpness, and Purification---four principles that formalise
the fundamental character of purity in nature---exhibits at most second-order
interference. Hence these theories are, at least conceptually, very ""close"" to
quantum theory. Along the way we show that systems in such theories correspond
to Euclidean Jordan algebras. Hence, they are self-dual and, moreover,
multi-slit experiments in such theories are described by pure projectors.

from Near-Earth Asteroid (101955) Bennu. The role of the navigation and flight
dynamics team is critical for the spacecraft to execute a precisely planned
sampling maneuver over a specifically-selected landing site. In particular, the
orientation of Bennu needs to be recovered with good accuracy during orbital
operations to contribute as small an error as possible to the landing error
budget. Although Bennu is well characterized from Earth-based radar
observations, its orientation dynamics are not sufficiently known to exclude
the presence of a small wobble. To better understand this contingency and
evaluate how well the orientation can be recovered in the presence of a large
1$^{\circ}$ wobble, we conduct a comprehensive simulation with the NASA GSFC
GEODYN orbit determination and geodetic parameter estimation software. We
describe the dynamic orientation modeling implemented in GEODYN in support of
OSIRIS-REx operations, and show how both altimetry and imagery data can be used
as either undifferenced (landmark, direct altimetry) or differenced (image
crossover, altimetry crossover) measurements. We find that these two different
types of data contribute differently to the recovery of instrument pointing or
planetary orientation. When upweighted, the absolute measurements help reduce
the geolocation errors, despite poorer astrometric (inertial) performance. We
find that with no wobble present, all the geolocation requirements are met.
While the presence of a large wobble is detrimental, the recovery is still
reliable thanks to the combined use of altimetry and imagery data.

if they exist, they must thus form a distinct subset under RG flows. We also
find many interesting characteristic properties that these putative theories
satisfy which may behelpful in proving or disproving their existence using

the two lowest levels within the first excited configuration $3d^94s$ in
Ni-like ions of heavy elements from $Z_N$=60 to $Z_N$=92 is within the range of
visible or near-IR lasers. The wavelengths of these transitions are calculated
within the relativistic model potential formalism and compared with other
theoretical and limited experimental data. Detailed collisional-radiative
simulations of non-Maxwellian and thermal plasmas are performed showing that
photopumping between these levels using relatively moderate lasers is
sufficient to provide a two-order of magnitude increase of the pumped level
population. This accordingly results in a similar rise of the x-ray line
intensity thereby allowing control of x-ray emission with visible/IR lasers.

a slope of 1.12+/-0.03 with no evidence of a break at high luminosity. Based on
the width of the region profile, bright regions are rather compact, while faint
regions are seen over a wide range of sizes. The radius function reveals a
slope of 1.81+/-0.02. BPT diagrams of the individual spaxels and integrated

patterns are mixed between the different subtypes. In clinical practice,
dominant patterns are investigated for signs of specific meningioma pathology;
however the simple observation could result in inter- and intra-observer
variation due to the complexity of the histopathological patterns. Also
employing a computerised feature extraction approach applied at a single
resolution scale might not suffice in accurately delineating the mixture of
histopathological patterns. In this work we propose a novel multiresolution
feature extraction approach for characterising the textural properties of the
different pathological patterns (i.e. mainly cell nuclei shape, orientation and
spatial arrangement within the cytoplasm). The pattern textural properties are
characterised at various scales and orientations for an improved separability
between the different extracted features. The Gabor filter energy output of
each magnitude response was combined with four other fixed-resolution texture
signatures (2 model-based and 2 statistical-based) with and without cell nuclei
segmentation. The highest classification accuracy of 95% was reported when
combining the Gabor filters energy and the meningioma subimage fractal
signature as a feature vector without performing any prior cell nuceli
segmentation. This indicates that characterising the cell-nuclei
self-similarity properties via Gabor filters can assists in achieving an
improved meningioma subtype classification, which can assist in overcoming
variations in reported diagnosis.

the coKleisli category for this comonad. This leads on to comonadic
characterisations of a number of central concepts in Finite Model Theory: -
Isomorphism in the co-Kleisli category characterises elementary equivalence in
the k-variable logic with counting quantifiers. - Symmetric games corresponding
to equivalence in full k-variable logic are also characterized. - The treewidth
of a structure A is characterised in terms of its coalgebra number: the least k

investigate turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection over rough plates in two
dimensions, up to $\mathrm{Ra}=10^{12}$. Varying the height and wavelength of
the roughness elements with over 200 combinations, we reveal the existence of
two universal regimes. In the first regime, the local effective scaling
exponent can reach up to 1/2. However, this cannot be explained as the
attainment of the so-called ultimate regime as suggested in previous studies,
because a further increase in $\mathrm{Ra}$ leads to the second regime, in
which the scaling saturates back to a value close to the smooth case.
Counterintuitively, the transition from the first to the second regime
corresponds to the competition between bulk and boundary layer flow: from the

individual breed composition based on the previously proposed idea of
regressing discrete random variables corresponding to counts of reference
alleles of biallelic molecular markers located across the genome on the allele
frequencies of each marker in the pure (base) breeds. Some of the existing
regression-based methods do not guarantee that estimators of breed composition
will lie in the appropriate parameter space and none of them account for
uncertainty about allele frequencies in the pure breeds, that is, uncertainty
about the design matrix. In order to overcome these limitations, we proposed
two Bayesian generalized linear models. For each individual, both models assume
that the counts of the reference allele at each marker locus follow independent
Binomial distributions, use the logit link, and pose a Dirichlet prior over the
vector of regression coefficients (which corresponds to breed composition).
This prior guarantees that point estimators of breed composition like the
posterior mean pertain to the appropriate space. The difference between these
models is that model termed BIBI does not account for uncertainty about the
design matrix, while model termed BIBI2 accounts for such an uncertainty by
assigning independent Beta priors to the entries of this matrix. We implemented
these models in a multibreed Angus-Brahman population. Posterior means were
used as point estimators of breed composition. In addition, the ordinary least
squares estimator proposed by Kuehn et al. (2011) (OLSK) was also computed.
BIBI and BIBI2 estimated breed composition more accurately than OLSK, and BIBI2

disks. Yet its distribution and dominant formation pathway(s) remain largely
unconstrained. To address these issues, we present ALMA observations of two
H2CO lines (3_{12}-2_{11} and 5_{15}-4_{14}) at 0"".5 (~30 au) spatial
resolution toward the disk around the nearby T Tauri star TW Hya. Emission from
both lines is spatially resolved, showing a central depression, a peak at 0"".4
radius, and a radial decline at larger radii with a bump at ~1"", near the
millimeter continuum edge. We adopt a physical model for the disk and use toy
models to explore the radial and vertical H2CO abundance structure. We find
that the observed emission implies the presence of at least two distinct H2CO
gas reservoirs: (1) a warm and unresolved inner component (<10 au), and (2) an
outer component that extends from ~15 au to beyond the millimeter continuum
edge. The outer component is further constrained by the line ratio to arise in
a more elevated disk layer at larger radii. The inferred H2CO abundance
structure agrees well with disk chemistry models, which predict efficient H2CO
gas-phase formation close to the star, and cold H2CO grain surface formation,
through H additions to condensed CO, followed by non-thermal desorption in the
outer disk. The implied presence of active grain surface chemistry in the TW
Hya disk is consistent with the recent detection of CH3OH emission, and
suggests that more complex organic molecules are formed in disks, as well.

such as high-performance and robustness, with the archival capabilities and low
cost of conventional hard-disk magnetic storage. Among candidate solid-state
nonvolatile memory technologies that could potentially be used to construct
SCM, flash memory is a well-established technology and have been widely used in
commercially available SCM incarnations. Flash-based SCM enables much better
tradeoffs between performance, space and power than disk-based systems.
However, write endurance is a significant challenge for a flash-based SCM (each
act of writing a bit may slightly damage a cell, so one flash cell can be
written 10^4--10^5 times, depending on the flash technology, before it becomes
unusable). This is a well-documented problem and has received a lot of
attention by manufactures that are using some combination of write reduction
and wear-leveling techniques for achieving longer lifetime. In an effort to
improve flash lifetime, first, by quantifying data longevity in an SCM, we show
that a majority of the data stored in a solid-state SCM do not require long
retention times provided by flash memory (i.e., up to 10 years in modern
devices); second, by exploiting retention time relaxation, we propose a novel
mechanism, called Dense-SLC (D-SLC), which enables us perform multiple writes
into a cell during each erase cycle for lifetime extension; and finally, we
discuss the required changes in the flash management software (FTL) in order to
use this characteristic for extending the lifetime of the solid-state part of
an SCM. Using an extensive simulation-based analysis of a flash-based SCM, we
demonstrate that D-SLC is able to significantly improve device lifetime
(between 5.1X and 8.6X) with no performance overhead and also very small
changes at the FTL software.

organisms. Many believe an essential component of this process was the
evolution of evolvability, whereby evolution speeds up its ability to innovate
by generating a more adaptive pool of offspring. One hypothesized mechanism for
evolvability is developmental canalization, wherein certain dimensions of
variation become more likely to be traversed and others are prevented from
being explored (e.g. offspring tend to have similarly sized legs, and mutations
affect the length of both legs, not each leg individually). While ubiquitous in
nature, canalization almost never evolves in computational simulations of
evolution. Not only does that deprive us of in silico models in which to study
the evolution of evolvability, but it also raises the question of which
conditions give rise to this form of evolvability. Answering this question
would shed light on why such evolvability emerged naturally and could
accelerate engineering efforts to harness evolution to solve important
engineering challenges. In this paper we reveal a unique system in which
canalization did emerge in computational evolution. We document that genomes
entrench certain dimensions of variation that were frequently explored during
their evolutionary history. The genetic representation of these organisms also
evolved to be highly modular and hierarchical, and we show that these
organizational properties correlate with increased fitness. Interestingly, the
type of computational evolutionary experiment that produced this evolvability
was very different from traditional digital evolution in that there was no
objective, suggesting that open-ended, divergent evolutionary processes may be
necessary for the evolution of evolvability.

transitions in the UV, we consider the case of Aluminum nanoparticles, as they
offer strong electromagnetic enhancements in the blue and UV spectral
intervals. Our calculations show that the complex composed of a chiral molecule

spectacular one-sided tails of gas and young stars, suggestive of intense
ram-pressure stripping. These so-called ""jellyfish"" galaxies typically have
late-type morphology. In this paper, we present MUSE observations of an
elliptical galaxy in Abell 2670 with long tails of material visible in the
optical spectra, as well as blobs with tadpole-like morphology. The spectra in
the central part of the galaxy reveals a stellar component as well as ionized
gas. The stellar component does not have significant rotation, while the
ionized gas defines a clear star-forming gas disk. We argue, based on deep
optical images of the galaxy, that the gas was most likely acquired during a
past wet merger. It is possible that the star-forming blobs are also remnants
of the merger. In addition, the direction and kinematics of the one-sided

  Short Dot Products","Presented at NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Faced with saturation of Moore's law and increasing dimension of data, system
designers have increasingly resorted to parallel and distributed computing.
However, distributed computing is often bottle necked by a small fraction of
slow processors called ""stragglers"" that reduce the speed of computation
because the fusion node has to wait for all processors to finish. To combat the
effect of stragglers, recent literature introduces redundancy in computations
across processors, e.g.,~using repetition-based strategies or erasure codes.
The fusion node can exploit this redundancy by completing the computation using
outputs from only a subset of the processors, ignoring the stragglers. In this
paper, we propose a novel technique -- that we call ""Short-Dot"" -- to introduce
redundant computations in a coding theory inspired fashion, for computing
linear transforms of long vectors. Instead of computing long dot products as
required in the original linear transform, we construct a larger number of
redundant and short dot products that can be computed faster and more
efficiently at individual processors. In reference to comparable schemes that
introduce redundancy to tackle stragglers, Short-Dot reduces the cost of
computation, storage and communication since shorter portions are stored and
computed at each processor, and also shorter portions of the input is
communicated to each processor. We demonstrate through probabilistic analysis
as well as experiments that Short-Dot offers significant speed-up compared to
existing techniques. We also derive trade-offs between the length of the
dot-products and the resilience to stragglers (number of processors to wait
for), for any such strategy and compare it to that achieved by our strategy.

that there exists a unified phase diagram for them. Here we show that the
ordered moments in a variety of iron pnictides are inversely proportional to
the effective Curie constants of their nematic susceptibility. This unexpected
scaling behavior suggests that the magnetic ground states of iron pnictides can
be achieved by tuning the strength of nematic fluctuations. Therefore, a
unified phase diagram can be established where superconductivity emerges from a

transmission capacity, for which exact theoretical results are known, are well
suited for ad hoc networks but are not directly applicable for cellular
wireless networks, where large-scale basestation (BS) coordination is not
possible, and retransmissions/ARQ under the SINR model is a universal feature.
  In this paper, cellular wireless networks, where both BS locations and mobile
user (MU) locations are distributed as independent Poisson point processes are
considered, and each MU connects to its nearest BS. With ARQ, under the SINR
model, the effective downlink rate of packet transmission is the reciprocal of
the expected delay (number of retransmissions needed till success), which we
use as our network capacity definition after scaling it with the BS density.
  Exact characterization of this natural capacity metric for cellular wireless
networks is derived. The capacity is shown to first increase polynomially with
the BS density in the low BS density regime and then scale inverse
exponentially with the increasing BS density. Two distinct upper bounds are
derived that are relevant for the low and the high BS density regimes. A single
power control strategy is shown to achieve the upper bounds in both the
regimes. This result is fundamentally different from the well known capacity
results for ad hoc networks, such as transport and transmission capacity that
scale as the square root of the (high) BS density. Our results show that the
strong temporal correlations of SINRs with PPP distributed BS locations is
limiting, and the realizable capacity in cellular wireless networks in high-BS
density regime is much smaller than previously thought. A byproduct of our
analysis shows that the capacity of the ALOHA strategy with retransmissions is
zero.

to study $\Lambda$ hypernuclei. Taking hypernucleus $^{61}_{\Lambda}$Ca as an
example, the single-particle resonant states for $\Lambda$ hyperons are
investigated by analyzing density of states and the corresponding energies and

i.e., the distributions of the very narrow $1f_{5/2}$ and $1f_{7/2}$ states are
very similar as bound states while that of the wide $1g_{7/2}$ and $1g_{9/2}$
states are like scattering states. Besides, the impurity effect of $\Lambda$
hyperons on the single-neutron resonant states are investigated. For most of
the resonant states, both the energies and widths decrease with adding more
$\Lambda$ hyperons due to the attractive $\Lambda N$ interaction. Finally, the
energy level structure of $\Lambda$ hyperons in the Ca hypernucleus isotopes
with mass number $A=53-73$ are studied, obvious shell structure and small
spin-orbit splitting are found for the single-$\Lambda$ spectrum.

multi-agent networks by sequentially adding edges. Specifically, we extend the
distributed dual averaging (DDA) subgradient algorithm to evolving networks of
growing connectivity and analyze the corresponding improvement in convergence
rate. It is known that the convergence rate of DDA is influenced by the
algebraic connectivity of the underlying network, where better connectivity
leads to faster convergence. However, the impact of network topology design on
the convergence rate of DDA has not been fully understood. In this paper, we
begin by designing network topologies via edge selection and scheduling. For
edge selection, we determine the best set of candidate edges that achieves the
optimal tradeoff between the growth of network connectivity and the usage of
network resources. The dynamics of network evolution is then incurred by edge
scheduling. Further, we provide a tractable approach to analyze the improvement
in the convergence rate of DDA induced by the growth of network connectivity.
Our analysis reveals the connection between network topology design and the
convergence rate of DDA, and provides quantitative evaluation of DDA
acceleration for distributed optimization that is absent in the existing
analysis. Lastly, numerical experiments show that DDA can be significantly
accelerated using a sequence of well-designed networks, and our theoretical
predictions are well matched to its empirical convergence behavior.

established in the literature for the continuous-time Gaussian and Poisson
channels, in a long line of work starting from the classical representation
theorems by Duncan and Kabanov respectively. In this work, we demonstrate that
such relations hold for a much larger family of continuous-time channels. We
introduce the family of semi-martingale channels where the channel output is a
semi-martingale stochastic process, and the channel input modulates the
characteristics of the semi-martingale. For these channels, which includes as a
special case the continuous time Gaussian and Poisson models, we establish new
representations relating the mutual information between the channel input and
output to an optimal causal filtering loss, thereby unifying and considerably
extending results from the Gaussian and Poisson settings. Extensions to the
setting of mismatched estimation are also presented where the relative entropy
between the laws governing the output of the channel under two different input
distributions is equal to the cumulative difference between the estimation loss
incurred by using the mismatched and optimal causal filters respectively. The
main tool underlying these results is the Doob--Meyer decomposition of a class
of likelihood ratio sub-martingales. The results in this work can be viewed as
the continuous-time analogues of recent generalizations for relations between

asymmetric dark matter motivate the idea that dark matter may have similar mass
to the proton, while mirror matter and $G \times G$ grand unified theories
provide rationales for additional gauge sectors which may have minimal
interactions with standard model particles. In this work we explore the
hadronic spectra that these dark QCD models can allow. The effects of the
number of light colored particles and the value of the confinement scale on the
lightest stable state, the dark matter candidate, are examined in the
hyperspherical constituent quark model for baryonic and mesonic states.

loop closure detection) is the key towards fully autonomous mobile robots and
self-driving vehicle navigation. Augmented with various Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping techniques (SLAM), loop closure detection allows for
incremental pose correction and can bolster efficient and accurate map
creation. However, repeated and similar scenes (perceptual aliasing) and long
term appearance changes (e.g. weather variations) are major challenges for
current place recognition algorithms. We introduce a new dataset Multisensory
Omnidirectional Long-term Place recognition (MOLP) comprising omnidirectional
intensity and disparity images. This dataset presents many of the challenges
faced by outdoor mobile robots and current place recognition algorithms. Using
MOLP dataset, we formulate the place recognition problem as a regularized
sparse convex optimization problem. We conclude that information extracted from
intensity image is superior to disparity image in isolating discriminative
features for successful long term place recognition. Furthermore, when these
discriminative features are extracted from an omnidirectional vision sensor, a
robust bidirectional loop closure detection approach is established, allowing
mobile robots to close the loop, regardless of the difference in the direction
when revisiting a place.

Fix two points $v_1=(0,0)$ and $v_2=(0, \lfloor k^{2/3} \rfloor)$ for some

status of our ongoing high precision study of in-medium spectral properties of

field theory allows us to capture the physics of quarkonium without modeling
assumptions in a thermal QCD medium. In our study a first principles and
realistic description of the QCD medium is provided by state-of-the-art
lattices of the HotQCD collaboration at almost physical pion mass. Our updated
results corroborate a picture of sequential modification of states with respect
to their vacuum binding energy. Using a novel low-gain variant of the Bayesian
BR method for reconstructing spectral functions we find that remnant features
of the Upsilon may survive up to $T\sim400$MeV, while the $\chi_b$ signal
disappears around $T\sim270$MeV. The $c\bar{c}$ analysis hints at melting of
$\chi_c$ below $T\sim190$MeV while some $J/\Psi$ remnant feature might survive
up to $T\sim245$MeV. An improved understanding of the numerical artifacts in
the Bayesian approach and the availability of increased statistics have made

reliable model. We also analyze the effect of the size of sliding window on
performance to detect the time point when the detection becomes reliable and to
inform owners the theft event as soon as possible. We apply our model with real

computer vision and image processing. Especially, in some applications, it is
often needed to compute 2-D complex Gabor filter bank consisting of the 2-D
complex Gabor filtering outputs at multiple orientations and frequencies.
Although several approaches for fast 2-D complex Gabor filtering have been
proposed, they primarily focus on reducing the runtime of performing the 2-D
complex Gabor filtering once at specific orientation and frequency. To obtain
the 2-D complex Gabor filter bank output, existing methods are repeatedly
applied with respect to multiple orientations and frequencies. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach that efficiently computes the 2-D complex Gabor
filter bank by reducing the computational redundancy that arises when
performing the Gabor filtering at multiple orientations and frequencies. The
proposed method first decomposes the Gabor basis kernels to allow a fast
convolution with the Gaussian kernel in a separable manner. This enables
reducing the runtime of the 2-D complex Gabor filter bank by reusing
intermediate results of the 2-D complex Gabor filtering computed at a specific
orientation. Furthermore, we extend this idea into 2-D localized sliding
discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) using the Gaussian kernel in the DFT
computation, which lends a spatial localization ability as in the 2-D complex
Gabor filter. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs faster than
state-of-the-arts methods for fast 2-D complex Gabor filtering, while
maintaining similar filtering quality.

a consequence of this interaction, the vacuum is expected to become

photon beam is influenced by both vacuum birefringence and dichroism in a
strong linearly polarized plane-wave laser field. Furthermore, we consider an
experimental scheme to measure these effects in the nonperturbative high-energy

circularly polarized high-energy probe photons, as opposed to the
conventionally considered linearly polarized ones, the feasibility of
quantitatively confirming the prediction of nonlinear QED for vacuum

well screened both in the clusters and bulk. On the other hand for the

profiles of AlO, AlOH and AlCl are detected and are used to derive a lower
limit of atomic aluminium incorporated in molecules. We show that the gas-phase
aluminium chemistry is completely different in both stars, with a remarkable
difference in the AlO and AlOH abundance stratification. The amount of
aluminium locked up in these 3 molecules is small, <=1.1e-7, for both stars,
i.e. only <=2% of the total aluminium budget. This leaves ample of room for
aluminium to be incorporated in grains. A fundamental result is that AlO and
AlOH, being the direct precursors of alumina grains, are detected well beyond
the onset of the dust condensation proving that the aluminium oxide
condensation cycle is not fully efficient. The ALMA observations allow us to
quantitatively assess the current generation of theoretical dynamical-chemical
models for AGB winds. We discuss how the current proposed scenario of aluminium
dust condensation for low mass-loss rate AGB stars at a distance of ~1.5 Rstar,

explain both the dust spectral features in the spectral energy distribution

halo has a significant effect upon the stellar dispersions for any non-maximal
disc. The correction for cuspy dark matter halos is particularly large,
suggesting that such models are not consistent with the observed stellar
dispersions. When a more realistic model for the vertical gravity of the disc
is used, the derived stellar surface densities are generally larger (smaller)
for disc radii smaller (larger) than 2.3 times the radial scale-length. When
the vertical gravity correction is applied to the radially resolved stellar
mass-to-light ratios derived by the DiskMass consortium, the true values are
not constant but decrease with radius, as expected from photometric colour
gradients, and the true mass scale-lengths are about 80% of the photometric
scale-lengths. The effects of a thin gaseous disc are larger than expected,
especially when an allowance is made for optically thick or CO-dark gas. The
presence of a thick-disc stellar component has severe consequences,

which sectors underperform at any given time. For this purpose, they use the
so-called hot spot score, which is the result of a combination of multiple
network measurements and reflects the instantaneous overall performance of
individual sectors. While operators have a good understanding of the current
performance of a network and its overall trend, forecasting the performance of
each sector over time is a challenging task, as it is affected by both regular
and non-regular events, triggered by human behavior and hardware failures. In
this paper, we study the spatio-temporal patterns of the hot spot score and
uncover its regularities. Based on our observations, we then explore the
possibility to use recent measurements' history to predict future hot spots. To
this end, we consider tree-based machine learning models, and study their
performance as a function of time, amount of past data, and prediction horizon.
Our results indicate that, compared to the best baseline, tree-based models can
deliver up to 14% better forecasts for regular hot spots and 153% better
forecasts for non-regular hot spots. The latter brings strong evidence that,
for moderate horizons, forecasts can be made even for sectors exhibiting
isolated, non-regular behavior. Overall, our work provides insight into the
dynamics of cellular sectors and their predictability. It also paves the way
for more proactive network operations with greater forecasting horizons.

from ~ 1wt% to ~ 25wt%. We also discussed the effects of the GIFs on the
dynamical and geochemical characteristics of formed terrestrial planets. We
found that the GIFs have the potential to solve the following dynamical and
geochemical conflicts: (1) The Earth, currently in a near circular orbit, is
likely to have had a highly eccentric orbit during the giant impact stage. The
GIFs are large enough in total mass to lower the eccentricity of the Earth to
its current value via their dynamical friction. (2) The concentrations of
highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the Earth's mantle are greater than what
was predicted experimentally. Re-accretion of the iron-bearing GIFs onto the
Earth can contribute to the excess of HSEs. In addition, the estimated amount
of iron-bearing GIFs provides significant reducing agent that could transform

factor. Surprisingly, the [12CO]/[13CO] abundance ratio in NGC 1140 is very low
(~ 8-20), lower even than the value of 24 found in the Galactic Center. The
young age of the starburst in NGC 1140 precludes 13C enrichment from evolved
intermediate-mass stars; instead we attribute the low ratio to charge-exchange
reactions and fractionation, because of the enhanced efficiency of these
processes in cool gas at moderate column densities. Fitting physical models to
12CO and [CI](1-0) emission in NGC 1140 gives an unusually low [12CO]/[12C]
abundance ratio, suggesting that in this galaxy atomic carbon is at least 10
times more abundant than 12CO.

driving themselves near points of criticality. Using a synthetic approach we
construct a conceptual model that, instead of specifying mechanistic
requirements to generate criticality, exploits the maintenance of an
organizational structure capable of reproducing critical behavior. Our approach
exploits the well-known principle of universality, which classifies critical
phenomena inside a few universality classes of systems independently of their
specific mechanisms or topologies. In particular, we implement an artificial
embodied agent controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation
structure randomly sampled from a lattice Ising model at a critical point. We
evaluate the agent in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the
Mountain Car benchmark and the Acrobot double pendulum, finding that in both
cases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality, which coincides
with a transition point between two regimes of the agent's behaviour,
maximizing the mutual information between neurons and sensorimotor patterns.
Finally, we discuss the possible applications of this synthetic approach to the
comprehension of deeper principles connected to the pervasive presence of
criticality in biological and cognitive systems.

biological processes, from nutrient capture and ligand binding, to grazing,
viral infection and cell-cell communication. The window of opportunity for
these interactions is ultimately determined by the physical mechanism that
enables proximity and governs the contact time. Jeanneret et al. (Nat. Comm. 7:
12518, 2016) reported recently that for the biflagellate microalga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contact with microparticles is controlled by events
in which the object is entrained by the swimmer over large distances. However,
neither the universality of this interaction mechanism nor its physical origins
are currently understood. Here we show that particle entrainment is indeed a
generic feature for microorganisms either pushed or pulled by flagella. By
combining experiments, simulations and analytical modelling we reveal that
entrainment length, and therefore contact time, can be understood within the
framework of Taylor dispersion as a competition between advection by the no
slip surface of the cell body and microparticle diffusion. The existence of an
optimal tracer size is predicted theoretically, and observed experimentally for
C. reinhardtii. Spatial organisation of flagella, swimming speed, swimmer and
tracer size influence entrainment features and provide different trade-offs
that may be tuned to optimise microbial interactions like predation and
infection.

the magnitude of the spin splitting. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical
expression for the longitudinal optical conductivity associated with inter-band
transitions as a function of the frequency for an arbitrary polarization angle.
We find that the diagonal components of the optical conductivity tensor are
direction-dependent and the spectrum of optical absorption is strongly
anisotropic with an absorption window. The height and width of this absorption
window are very sensitive to the system anisotropy. While the height of
absorption peak increases with increasing effective mass anisotropy ratio, the
peak intensity is larger when the light polarization is along the armchair
direction. Moreover, the absorption peak width becomes broader as the density
of state mass or Rashba interaction is enhanced. These features can be used to
determine parameters relevant for spintronics through the optical absorption
spectrum.

is found down to 1.8 K. The magnetic susceptibility of these samples is field
independent in the temperature range 10 - 400 K and does not show irreversible
effects at low temperatures. In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility of
samples with iron excess shows substantial field dependence at high
temperatures and manifests a pronounced magnetic irreversibility at low
temperatures with a difference between ZFC and FC susceptibilities and a
maximum at 10 K reminiscent of a magnetic transition. Single crystal x-ray
diffraction of the stoichiometric samples revealed a single phase spinel
structure without site inversion. In single crystalline samples with Fe excess
besides the main spinel phase a second ordered single-crystal phase was
detected with the diffraction pattern of a vacancy-ordered superstructure of
iron sulfide, close to the 5C polytype Fe9S10. Specific heat studies reveal a
broad anomaly, which evolves below 20 K in both stoichiometric and
off-stoichiometric crystals. We show that the low-temperature specific heat can
be well described by considering the low-lying spin-orbital electronic levels

in biology and social science. It is common practice to assume that players
quickly converge to an equilibrium, e.g. a Nash equilibrium. This can be
studied in terms of best reply dynamics, in which each player myopically uses
the best response to her opponent's last move. Existing research shows that
convergence can be problematic when there are best reply cycles. Here we
calculate how typical this is by studying the space of all possible two-player
normal form games and counting the frequency of best reply cycles. The two key
parameters are the number of moves, which defines how complicated the game is,
and the anti-correlation of the payoffs, which determines how competitive it
is. We find that as games get more complicated and more competitive, best reply
cycles become dominant. The existence of best reply cycles predicts
non-convergence of six different learning algorithms that have support from
human experiments. Our results imply that for complicated and competitive games
equilibrium is typically an unrealistic assumption. Alternatively, if for some
reason ""real"" games are special and do not possess cycles, we raise the
interesting question of why this should be so.

takes the following form: for any class of templates $\mathcal F$ closed under
finite perturbations, the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of the set of

finite perturbation) can be written as the suprema over $\mathcal F$ of certain
natural functions on the space of templates. Besides implying KKLM's

Asymmetries are calculated for different charged final states due to
intermediate $K_1(1400)$ and $K_1(1270)$ resonant states. Three distinct
interference mechanisms are identified contributing to asymmetries at different
levels for these two kaon resonances. For $K_1(1400)$ decays including a final
state $\pi^0$ an asymmetry around $+30\%$ is calculated, dominated by
interference of two intermediate $K^*\pi$ states, while an asymmetry around
$+10\%$ in decays including final $\pi^+\pi^-$ is dominated by interference of
$S$ and $D$ wave $K^*\pi$ amplitudes. In decays via $K_1(1270)$ to final states
including a $\pi^0$ a negative asymmetry is favored up to $-10\%$ if one
assumes $S$ wave dominance in decays to $K^*\pi$ and $K\rho$, while in decays
involving $\pi^+\pi^-$ the asymmetry can vary anywhere in the range $-13\%$ to
$+24\%$ depending on unknown phases. For more precise asymmetry predictions in
the latter decays we propose studying phases in $K_1 \to K^*\pi, K\rho$ by
performing dedicated amplitude analyses of $B\to J/\psi(\psi') K\pi\pi$. In

properties in the normal state of a clean superconductor in three dimensions.
Using a functional renormalization group approach to take the non-Gaussian
nature of critical fluctuations into account, we show microscopically that in
the BCS regime, where the inverse coherence length is much smaller than the
Fermi wavevector, critical pairing fluctuations give rise to a non-analytic
contribution to the quasi-particle damping of order $ T_c \sqrt{Gi} \ln ( 80 /
Gi )$, where the Ginzburg-Levanyuk number $Gi$ is a dimensionless measure for
the width of the critical region. As a consequence, there is a temperature
window above $T_c$ where the quasiparticle damping due to critical pairing
fluctuations can be larger than the usual $T^2$-Fermi liquid damping due to
non-critical scattering processes. On the other hand, in the strong coupling
regime where $Gi$ is of order unity, we find that the quasiparticle damping due
to critical pairing fluctuations is proportional to the temperature. Moreover,
we show that in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ the electronic
density of states exhibits a fluctuation-induced pseudogap. We also use
functional renormalization group methods to derive and classify various types
of processes induced by the pairing interaction in Fermi systems close to the
superconducting instability.

material engineering to geology. It has been noticed for a long time that the
phenomenon is ""scale-free"", indicating some type of criticality. In spite of
attempts to invoke ""Self-Organized Criticality"", the physical origin of this
criticality, and also its universal nature, being quite insensitive to the
nature of microscopic interactions, remained elusive. Recently we proposed that
the precise nature of this critical behavior is manifested by a spinodal point
of a thermodynamic phase transition. Moreover, at the spinodal point there
exists a divergent correlation length which is associated with the
system-spanning instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to
the mechanical yield. Demonstrating this requires the introduction of an ""order
parameter"" that is suitable for distinguishing between disordered amorphous
systems, and an associated correlation function, suitable for picking up the
growing correlation length. The theory, the order parameter, and the
correlation functions used are universal in nature and can be applied to any
amorphous solid that undergoes mechanical yield. Critical exponents for the
correlation length divergence and the system size dependence are estimated. The
phenomenon is seen at its sharpest in athermal systems, as is explained below;
in this paper we extend the discussion also to thermal systems, showing that at
sufficiently high temperatures the spinodal phenomenon is destroyed by thermal
fluctuations.

estimate the likeness or similarity between things in the way human beings
estimate the similarity between stimuli.
  In this context, this book focuses on semantic measures: approaches designed
for comparing semantic entities such as units of language, e.g. words,
sentences, or concepts and instances defined into knowledge bases. The aim of
these measures is to assess the similarity or relatedness of such semantic
entities by taking into account their semantics, i.e. their meaning --
intuitively, the words tea and coffee, which both refer to stimulating
beverage, will be estimated to be more semantically similar than the words
toffee (confection) and coffee, despite that the last pair has a higher
syntactic similarity. The two state-of-the-art approaches for estimating and
quantifying semantic similarities/relatedness of semantic entities are
presented in detail: the first one relies on corpora analysis and is based on
Natural Language Processing techniques and semantic models while the second is
based on more or less formal, computer-readable and workable forms of knowledge
such as semantic networks, thesaurus or ontologies. (...) Beyond a simple
inventory and categorization of existing measures, the aim of this monograph is
to convey novices as well as researchers of these domains towards a better
understanding of semantic similarity estimation and more generally semantic
measures.

spatiotemporal patterns were first reported in nonlocally coupled phase
oscillators, and it was shown that such mixed type behavior occurs only for
specific initial conditions in nonlocally and globally coupled networks. The
influence of initial conditions on chimera states has remained a fundamental
problem since their discovery. In this report, we investigate the robustness of
chimera states together with incoherent and coherent states in dependence on

characterized by mean phase velocity and a statistical measure, such as the

show further how the coexistence of different dynamical states can be
identified and quantified by means of the basin stability measure over a wide

are stochastic processes generating potential rewards over discrete time. The
rewards are generated according to the stochastic process, but at each step, an
existing reward disappears with a given probability. The edges in the graph
encode the (unit-distance) paths between the rewards' locations. On visiting a
node, the robot collects the accumulated reward at the node at that time, but
traveling between the nodes takes time. The optimization question asks to
compute an optimal (or epsilon-optimal) path that maximizes the expected
collected rewards.
  We consider the finite and infinite-horizon robot routing problems. For
finite-horizon, the goal is to maximize the total expected reward, while for
infinite horizon we consider limit-average objectives. We study the
computational and strategy complexity of these problems, establish NP-lower
bounds and show that optimal strategies require memory in general. We also
provide an algorithm for computing epsilon-optimal infinite paths for arbitrary

applying collectively some method to protect their security. Indeed, there are
numerous already classic results about revealing aggregated data from a set of
users. The conclusion is usually as follows: if you have enough friends to
""aggregate"" the private data, you can safely reveal your private information.
  Apart from data aggregation, it has been noticed that in a wider context
privacy can be often reduced to being hidden in a crowd. Generally, the
problems is how to create such crowd. This task may be not easy in some
distributed systems, wherein gathering enough ""individuals"" is hard for
practical reasons.
  Such example are social networks (or similar systems), where users have only
a limited number of semi trusted contacts and their aim is to reveal some
aggregated data in a privacy preserving manner. This may be particularly
problematic in the presence of a strong adversary that can additionally corrupt
some users.
  We show two methods that allow to significantly amplify privacy with only
limited number of local operations and very moderate communication overhead.
Except theoretical analysis we show experimental results on topologies of
real-life social networks to demonstrate that our methods can significantly
amplify privacy of chosen aggregation protocols even facing a massive attack of
a powerful adversary.

measurements made using N-body simulations. Recently, there has been progress
in extending the reach of perturbation theory to larger k using ideas borrowed
from effective field theory. We revisit the computation of the redshift-space
matter power spectrum within this framework, including for the first time the
full one-loop time dependence. We use a resummation scheme proposed by Vlah et
al. to account for damping of baryonic acoustic oscillations due to large-scale
random motions and show that this has a significant effect on the multipole
power spectra. We renormalize by comparison to a suite of custom N-body
simulations matching the MultiDark MDR1 cosmology. At z = 0 and for scales k
$\lesssim$ 0.4 h/Mpc we find that the EFT furnishes a description of the
real-space power spectrum up to $\sim$2%, for the $\ell$ = 0 mode up to
$\sim$5%, and for the $\ell$ = 2, 4 modes up to $\sim$25%. We argue that, in
the MDR1 cosmology, positivity of the $\ell$ = 0 mode gives a firm upper limit
of k $\approx$ 0.75 h/Mpc for the validity of the one-loop EFT prediction in
redshift space using only the lowest-order counterterm. We show that replacing
the one-loop growth factors by their Einstein-de Sitter counterparts is a good
approximation for the $\ell$ = 0 mode, but can induce deviations as large as 2%

may be overcome under the hypothesis of low effective dimensionality. Then, the
search of solutions can be reduced to the random embedding of a low dimensional
space into the original one, resulting in a more manageable optimization
problem. Specifically, in the case of time consuming black-box functions and
when the budget of evaluations is severely limited, global optimization with
random embeddings appears as a sound alternative to random search. Yet, in the
case of box constraints on the native variables, defining suitable bounds on a
low dimensional domain appears to be complex. Indeed, a small search domain
does not guarantee to find a solution even under restrictive hypotheses about
the function, while a larger one may slow down convergence dramatically. Here
we tackle the issue of low-dimensional domain selection based on a detailed
study of the properties of the random embedding, giving insight on the
aforementioned difficulties. In particular, we describe a minimal
low-dimensional set in correspondence with the embedded search space. We
additionally show that an alternative equivalent embedding procedure yields

the crust may stretch or shrink while their electrostatic pressure becomes
anisotropic. The pressure depends non-linearly on the magnitude of the stretch,
so that a continuous magnetic field evolution may result in an abrupt crystal
elongation or contraction. This may provide a trigger for magnetar activity. A
phonon mode instability is revealed, which sets the limits of magnetic field
variation beyond which the crystal is destroyed. These limits sometimes
correspond to surprisingly large deformations. It is not known what happens to
crust matter subject to a pressure anisotropy exceeding these limits. We
hypothesize that the ion system then possesses a long-range order only in one

unambiguous calculation of such norm kernels has become available under the
form of Pfaffians~[L. M. Robledo, Phys. Rev. C79, 021302 (2009)].
  The goals of this work is (i) to propose and implement an alternative to the
Pfaffian method to compute unambiguously the norm overlap between arbitrary
Bogoliubov quasiparticle states and (ii) to extend the first point to
explicitly correlated norm kernels at play in recently developped
particle-number-restored Bogoliubov coupled-cluster (PNR-BCC) and
particle-number-restored many-body perturbation (PNR-BMBPT) ab initio
theories~[T. Duguet and A. Signoracci, J. Phys. G44, 015103 (2017)]. Point (i)
constitutes the purpose of the present paper while point (ii) is addressed in a
forthcoming companion paper.
  We generalize the method used in~[T. Duguet and A. Signoracci, J. Phys. G44,
015103 (2017)] to obtain the norm overlap between arbitrary Bogoliubov product
states under a closed-form expression. The formula is physically intuitive,
accurate, versatile and relies on elementary linear algebra operations. It
equally applies to norm overlaps between Bogoliubov states of even or odd
number parity. Numerical applications illustrate these features and provide a
transparent representation of the content of the norm overlaps. Furthermore,
the closed-form expression extends naturally to correlated overlaps at play in
PNR-BCC and PNR-BMBPT. As such, the straight overlap between Bogoliubov states
is the zeroth-order reduction of more involved norm kernels to be studied in
the forthcoming paper.

subdomains of interest (called patches) containing the different sources of

which requires the solution of a sequence of linear global problems (with
deterministic operators and uncertain right-hand sides), and non-linear local
problems (with uncertain operators and/or right-hand sides) over the patches.
Non-linear local problems are solved using an adaptive sampling-based
least-squares method for the construction of sparse polynomial approximations
of local solutions as functions of the random parameters. Consistency,
convergence and robustness of the algorithm are proved under general
assumptions on the semi-linear elliptic operator. A convergence acceleration
technique (Aitken's dynamic relaxation) is also introduced to speed up the

still employing QAM or star shape constellations, mainly due to the existing
low complexity detectors. In this paper, we investigate the low complexity
detection for a family of QAM isomorphic constellations. These constellations
are known to perform very close to the peak-power limited capacity,
outperforming the DVB-S2X standard constellations. The proposed strategy is to
first remap the received signals to the QAM constellation using the existing
isomorphism and then break the log likelihood ratio computations to two one
dimensional PAM constellations. Gains larger than 0.6 dB with respect to QAM
can be obtained over the peak power limited channels without any increase in
detection complexity. Our scheme also provides a systematic way to design
constellations with low complexity one dimensional detectors. Several open
problems are discussed at the end of the paper.

multi-channel and speckle reduction techniques must jointly process all

general scheme, called MuLoG (MUlti-channel LOgarithm with Gaussian denoising),
to include such Gaussian denoisers within a multi-channel SAR speckle reduction

how cells function and respond to environmental cues and perturbations. An
important step in this direction is to infer the transcription factor-gene
regulatory network (GRN). However gene regulatory networks are typically
constructed disregarding the fact that regulatory programs are conditioned on
tissue type, developmental stage, sex, and other factors. Collecting multitude
of features required for a reliable construction of GRNs such as physical
features and functional features for every context of interest is costly.
Therefore we need methods that is able to use the knowledge of a
context-agnostic network for construction of a context specific regulatory
network.
  To address this challenge we developed a computational approach that uses
context specific expression data and a GRN constructed in a different but
related context to construct a context specific GRN. Our method, NetREX, is
inspired by network component analysis that estimates TF activities and their
influences on target genes given predetermined topology of a TF-gene network.
To predict a network under a different condition, NetREX removes the
restriction that the topology of the TF-gene network is fixed and allows for
adding and removing edges to that network. To solve the corresponding
optimization problem, we provide a general mathematical framework allowing use
of the recently proposed PALM technique and develop a convergent algorithm.
  We tested our NetREX on simulated data and subsequently applied it to gene
expression data in adult females from Drosophila deletion (DrosDel) panel. The
networks predicted by NetREX showed higher biological consistency than
alternative approaches. In addition, we used the list of recently identified
targets of the Doublesex (DSX) transcription factor to demonstrate the
predictive power of our method.

surface of the plate are used to validate ambient-noise theory through
comparison of the causal and anticausal (i.e., positive- and negative-time)

studied as a function of the initial and end times of the integral. We show
that even cross-correlations measured over limited time windows converge to a
significant part of the Green's function. Convergence is achieved over a wide
time window, which includes not only direct flexural-wave arrivals, but also
the multiply reverberated coda. We propose a model, based on normal-mode

interference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of
residual frequency-offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of-arrival (ToA)
of the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a
low complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog
circuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as
1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect
ToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running
the EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated
for each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA
resolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of
time-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate
such as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small
search window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the
refined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three
cells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the
position of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical
simulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against
impairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual
FO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional
ToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device.

obtained in 2015 and 2016 with the SINFONI integral field spectrograph and the
NACO imager at the ESO VLT. The spatially resolved dynamics of the Br$\gamma$
line emission can be accounted for by the ballistic motion and tidal shearing
of a test-particle cloud that has followed a highly eccentric Keplerian orbit
around the black hole for the last 12 years. The non-detection of a drag force
or any strong hydrodynamic interaction with the hot gas in the inner accretion
zone limits the ambient density to less than a few 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ at the
distance of closest approach (1500 $R_s$), assuming G2 is a spherical cloud
moving through a stationary and homogeneous atmosphere. The dust continuum
emission is unresolved in L'-band, but stays consistent with the location of
the Br$\gamma$ emission. The total luminosity of the Br$\gamma$ and L' emission
has remained constant to within the measurement uncertainty. The nature and
origin of G2 are likely related to that of the precursor source G1, since their
orbital evolution is similar, though not identical. Both object are also likely

words and sentences. As a remedy, this paper proposes a novel learning strategy
to detect negations: we apply reinforcement learning to find a policy that
replicates the human perception of negations based on an exogenous response,

eliminates the former need for expensive and subjective manual labeling in an

present the results of an interactive segmentation approach for liver

challenging because of the low image quality and the low contrast between the
metastasis and the surrounding liver tissue. Thus, the state of the art in
clinical practice is still manual measurement and outlining of the metastases
in the US images. We tackle the problem by providing an interactive

The approach has been evaluated with typical US acquisitions from the clinical
routine, and the datasets consisted of pancreatic cancer metastases. Even for
difficult cases, satisfying segmentations results could be achieved because of
the interactive real-time behavior of the approach. In total, 40 clinical
images have been evaluated with our method by comparing the results against
manual ground truth segmentations. This evaluation yielded to an average Dice

The anomalous ""sweeping effect"", a known drawback common to kinematic

Lagrangian dispersion statistics of the model are accurately analysed by
computing the Finite-Scale Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE), which is the optimal
measure of the scaling properties of dispersion. FSLE scaling exponents provide
a severe test to decide whether model simulations are in agreement with
theoretical expectations and/or observation. The results of our numerical
experiments cover a wide range of ""Reynolds numbers"" and show that chaotic
deterministic flows can be very efficient, and numerically low-cost, models of
turbulent trajectories in stationary, homogeneous and isotropic conditions. The
mathematics of the model is relatively simple and, in a geophysical context,
potential applications may regard small-scale parametrization issues in general

have a residual root mean square between 0.2 arcsec and few arcsec- onds, not
yet completely understood. Systematic errors have to be better understood and
treated in order to use strong lensing clusters as reliable cosmological
probes. We have analysed two simulated Hubble-Frontier-Fields-like clusters
from the Hubble Frontier Fields Comparison Challenge, Ares and Hera. We use
several estimators (relative bias on magnification, den- sity profiles,
ellipticity and orientation) to quantify the goodness of our reconstructions by
comparing our multiple models, optimized with the parametric software LENSTOOL
, with the input models. We have quantified the impact of systematic errors
arising, first, from the choice of different density profiles and
configurations and, secondly, from the availability of con- straints
(spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, redshift ranges of the background
sources) in the parametric modelling of strong lensing galaxy clusters and
therefore on the retrieval of cosmological parameters. We find that
substructures in the outskirts have a significant im- pact on the position of
the multiple images, yielding tighter cosmological contours. The need for
wide-field imaging around massive clusters is thus reinforced. We show that
competitive cosmological constraints can be obtained also with complex
multimodal clusters and that photometric redshifts improve the constraints on
cosmological parameters when considering a narrow range of (spectroscopic)
redshifts for the sources.

bipartite matching problem. Karp et al. (STOC 1990) gave an elegant algorithm
in the unweighted case that achieves a tight competitive ratio of $1-1/e$. In
the weighted case, however, we can easily show that no competitive ratio is
obtainable without the commonly accepted free disposal assumption. Under this
assumption, it is not hard to prove that the greedy algorithm is $1/2$
competitive, and that this is tight for deterministic algorithms. We present
the first randomized algorithm that breaks this long-standing $1/2$ barrier and
achieves a competitive ratio of at least $0.501$. In light of the hardness
result of Kapralov et al. (SODA 2013) that restricts beating a $1/2$
competitive ratio for the monotone submodular welfare maximization problem, our
result can be seen as strong evidence that solving the weighted bipartite
matching problem is strictly easier than submodular welfare maximization in the

with the new solar capability of the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter
Array (ALMA). We investigate the thermal and plasma diagnostic potential of
ALMA for solar prominences through the computation of brightness temperatures
at ALMA wavelengths. The brightness temperature, for a chosen line of sight, is
calculated using densities of hydrogen and helium obtained from a radiative
transfer code under non local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) conditions, as
well as the input internal parameters of the prominence model in consideration.
Two distinct sets of prominence models were used: isothermal-isobaric
fine-structure threads, and large-scale structures with radially increasing
temperature distributions representing the prominence-to-corona transition
region. We compute brightness temperatures over the range of wavelengths in
which ALMA is capable of observing (0.32 - 9.6mm), however we particularly
focus on the bands available to solar observers in ALMA cycles 4 and 5, namely
2.6 - 3.6mm (Band 3) and 1.1 - 1.4mm (Band 6). We show how the computed
brightness temperatures and optical thicknesses in our models vary with the
plasma parameters (temperature and pressure) and the wavelength of observation.
We then study how ALMA observables such as the ratio of brightness temperatures
at two frequencies can be used to estimate the optical thickness and the
emission measure for isothermal and non-isothermal prominences. From this study
we conclude that, for both sets of models, ALMA presents a strong thermal
diagnostic capability, provided that the interpretation of observations is
supported by the use of non-LTE simulation results.

dimension where particles hop asymmetrically. In its simplest form, namely
asymmetric zero range process (AZRP), particles hop on a one dimensional
periodic lattice with asymmetric hop rates; the rates for both right and left
moves depend only on the occupation at the departure site but their functional
forms are different. We show that AZRP leads to a factorized steady state (FSS)
when its rate-functions satisfy certain constraints. We demonstrate with
explicit examples that AZRP exhibits certain interesting features which were
not possible in usual zero range process. Firstly, it can undergo a
condensation transition depending on how often a particle makes a right move
compared to a left one and secondly, the particle current in AZRP can reverse
its direction as density is changed. We show that these features are common in
other asymmetric models which have FSS, like the asymmetric misanthrope process
where rate functions for right and left hops are different, and depend on
occupation of both the departure and the arrival site. We also derive
sufficient conditions for having cluster-factorized steady states for finite
range process with such asymmetric rate functions and discuss possibility of
condensation there.

(PN) progenitors. We use our earlier claim for a low mass loss rate of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that are not spun-up by a stellar or

the brightest PNe in old stellar populations reach the same luminosity as the
brightest PNe in young populations. It is quite likely that the best solution

higher AGB luminosities, as obtained in some new stellar models, and the lower

of interest from its incomplete random linear observations. A line of recent
work has studied that, with the extra prior information about the signal, one
can recover the signal with much fewer observations. For this purpose, the
general approach is to solve weighted convex function minimization problem. In
such settings, the convex function is chosen to promote the low-dimensional
structure and the optimal weights are so chosen to reduce the number of
measurements required for the optimization problem. In this paper, we consider
a generalized non-uniform model in which the structured signal falls into some
partitions, with entries of each partition having a definite probability to be
an element of the structure support. Given these probabilities and regarding
the recent developments in conic integral geometry, we provide a method to
choose the unique optimal weights for any general low-dimensional signal model.
This class of low-dimensional signal model includes many popular examples such
as $\ell_1$ analysis (entry-wise sparsity in an arbitrary redundant
dictionary), $\ell_{1,2}$ norm (block sparsity) and total variation semi-norm
(for piece-wise constant signals). We show through precise analysis and
simulations that the weighted convex optimization problem significantly
improves the regular convex optimization problem as we choose the unique

experimentally determining absolute photodesorption yields for the CH4 molecule
as a function of photon energy. The influence of the ice composition is also
investigated. By studying the methane desorption from layered CH4:CO ice,
indirect desorption processes triggered by the excitation of the CO molecules
is monitored and quantified. Methods. Tunable monochromatic VUV light from the
DESIRS beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron is used in the 7 - 13.6 eV (177 - 91
nm) range to irradiate pure CH4 or layers of CH4 deposited on top of CO ice
samples. The release of species in the gas phase is monitored by quadrupole
mass spectrometry and absolute photodesorption yields of intact CH4 are
deduced. Results. CH4 photodesorbs for photon energies higher than ~9.1 eV
(~136 nm). The photodesorption spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of CH4,
which confirms a desorption mechanism mediated by electronic transitions in the
ice. When it is deposited on top of CO, CH4 desorbs between 8 and 9 eV with a
pattern characteristic of CO absorption, indicating desorption induced by
energy transfer from CO molecules. Conclusions. The photodesorption of CH4 from
the pure ice in various interstellar environments is around 2.0 x 10^-3
molecules per incident photon. Results on CO-induced indirect desorption of CH4
provide useful insights for the generalization of this process to other
molecules co-existing with CO in ice mantles.

channel frequency-selectivity and the rectifier nonlinearity, so as to enhance
the end-to-end power transfer efficiency of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT).
Those waveforms have been designed assuming perfect channel state information
at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on
limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective
channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the Energy Transmitter (ET)
transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder
within a codebook, and the Energy Receiver (ER) reports the index of the
precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the
waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in
each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease
in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback,
the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook
over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's
algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the
codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited
feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines,

2016jca are inconsistent with being powered solely by a magnetar central
engine, as proposed by other authors, and demonstrate that it was likely
powered exclusively by energy deposited by the radioactive decay of nickel and
cobalt into their daughter products, which were nucleosynthesized when its

driving force for polaron formation (the dielectric electron-phonon coupling)
is balanced by the light band effective-masses, leading to a
strongly-interacting large-polaron. A first-principles prediction of mobility
would help understand the fundamental mobility limits. Theories of mobility
need to consider the polaron (rather than free-carrier) state due to the strong
interactions. In this material we expect that at room temperature polar-optical
phonon mode scattering will dominate, and so limit mobility. We calculate the
temperature-dependent polaron mobility of hybrid halide perovskites by
variationally solving the Feynman polaron model with the finite-temperature
free-energies of \=Osaka. This model considers a simplified effective-mass
band-structure interacting with a continuum dielectric of characteristic
response frequency. We parametrise the model fully from electronic-structure
calculations. In methylammonium lead iodide at 300 K we predict electron and
hole mobilities of 133 and 94 cm^2/V/s respectively. These are in acceptable
agreement with single-crystal measurements, suggesting that the intrinsic limit
of the polaron charge carrier state has been reached. Repercussions for
hot-electron photo-excited states are discussed. As well as mobility, the model
also exposes the dynamic structure of the polaron. This can be used to
interpret impedance measurements of the charge-carrier state. We provide the
phonon-drag mass-renormalisation, and scattering time constants. These could be
used as parameters for larger-scale device models and band-structure dependent
mobility simulations.

complexes remain controversial. Following the observation of long-lived beats
in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of PC645, vibronic coherence, the
delocalization of excited states between pigments supported by a resonant
vibration, has been proposed to enable direct down-conversion from the
highest-energy states to the lowest-energy pigments. Here, we instead show that
for phycobiliprotein PC645 an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism is at
play. We quantify the solvation dynamics of individual pigments using ab initio
QM/MM nuclear dynamics. Our atomistic spectral densities reproduce experimental
observations ranging from absorption and fluorescence spectra to the timescales
and selectivity of down-conversion observed in transient absorption
measurements. We demonstrate that bilin solvation controls EET pathways and
that direct down-conversion proceeds incoherently, enhanced by large
reorganization energies and a broad collection of high-frequency vibrations. We
thus suggest that engineering local solvation dynamics represents a potential
design principle for nanoscale control of EET.

against molecules in self-tissues. Different autoimmune diseases are
characterized by distinct immune responses, making autoantibodies useful for
diagnosis and prediction. In many diseases, the targets of autoantibodies are
incompletely defined. Although the technologies for autoantibody discovery have
advanced dramatically over the past decade, each of these techniques generates
hundreds of possibilities, which are onerous and expensive to validate. We set
out to establish a method to greatly simplify autoantibody discovery, using a
pre-filtering step to define subgroups with similar specificities based on
migration of radiolabeled, immunoprecipitated proteins on sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) gels and autoradiography [$\textbf{G}$el
$\textbf{E}$lectrophoresis and band detection on $\textbf{A}$utoradiograms
(GEA)]. Human recognition of patterns is not optimal when the patterns are
complex or scattered across many samples. Multiple sources of errors -
including irrelevant intensity differences and warping of gels - have
challenged automation of pattern discovery from autoradiograms.
  In this paper, we address these limitations using a Bayesian hierarchical
model with shrinkage priors for pattern alignment and spatial dewarping. The
Bayesian model combines information from multiple gel sets and corrects spatial
warping for coherent estimation of autoantibody signatures defined by presence
or absence of a grid of landmark proteins. We show the pre-processing creates
more clearly separated clusters and improves the accuracy of autoantibody
subset detection via hierarchical clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of the proposed methods with GEA data from scleroderma patients.

first model the interactions between each party and their electors are
considered. We show that these interactions drive the decision functions
towards certain asymptotic values depending on the electors only: this is the
{\em perfect party}, which behaves following the electors' suggestions. The
second model is an extension of the first one in which we include a $rule$
which modifies the status of the electors, and of the decision functions as a
consequence, at some specific time step. In the third model we neglect the
interactions with the electors while we consider cubic and quartic interactions
between the parties and we show that we get (slightly oscillating) asymptotic
values for the decision functions, close to their initial values. This is the
{\em real party}, which does not listen to the electors. Several explicit
situations are considered in details and numerical results are also shown.

alleviate the curse of dimensionality for EDAs by performing the operations of

decreasing with strain and then reaching a steady state, is observed at all the

and reverse creep behaviour, i.e., strain rate increasing with strain, then
reaching a steady state and again decreasing, is observed above that stress. At
300 C, reverse creep behaviour is observed at all the stresses employed. This
pattern remains the same for all the composites. The reverse creep behaviour is
found to be associated with the fibre breakage. The stress exponent is found to
be very high for all the composites. However, after taking the threshold stress
into account, the stress exponent varies from 3.9 to 7.0, which suggests
viscous glide and dislocation climb being the dominant creep mechanisms. The

physics to experimentally estimate three sorption isotherm coefficients of a

transport of moisture, the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) and the experimental
set-up are presented. Then measurements of relative humidity within the
material are carried out, after searching the OED, which is based on the
computation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown
parameters employed in the mathematical model. The OED enables to plan the
experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions
out of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification
method and, thus, for the estimated parameter. Two experimental procedures were
identified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii)
multiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period
for each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor
has to be placed near the impermeable boundary. After the measurements, the
parameter estimation problem is solved using an interior point algorithm to
minimize the cost function. Several tests are performed for the definition of
the cost function, by using the L^2 or L^\infty norm and considering the
experiments separately or at the same time. It has been found out that the
residual between the experimental data and the numerical model is minimized
when considering the discrete Euclidean norm and both experiments separately.
It means that two parameters are estimated using one experiment while the third
parameter is determined with the other experiment. Two cost functions are
defined and minimized for this approach. Moreover, the algorithm requires less
than 100 computations of the direct model to obtain the solution. In addition,
the OED sensitivity functions enable to capture an approximation of the
probability distribution function of the estimated parameters. The determined
sorption isotherm coefficients calibrate the numerical model to fit better the
experimental data. However, some discrepancies still appear since the model
does not take into account the hysteresis effects on the sorption capacity.
Therefore, the model is improved proposing a second differential equation for
the sorption capacity to take into account the hysteresis between the main
adsorption and desorption curves. The OED approach is also illustrated for the
estimation of five of the coefficients involved in the hysteresis model. To
conclude, the prediction of the model with hysteresis are compared with the
experimental observations to illustrate the improvement of the prediction.

  Convolutional Networks","In Proceedings of the 12th International Joint Conference on Computer
  Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Volume 5:
  Visapp, (Visigrapp 2017)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic scene understanding is a challenging problem and motion segmentation
plays a crucial role in solving it. Incorporating semantics and motion enhances
the overall perception of the dynamic scene. For applications of outdoor
robotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for
extracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the
formulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information
being incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features
and motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic
motion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating
optical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution
network. The pipeline consists of three main stages i.e Feature extraction,
Feature amplification and Multi Scale Context Aggregation to fuse the semantics
and flow features. Our joint formulation shows significant improvements in
monocular motion segmentation over the state of the art methods on challenging
KITTI tracking dataset.

  Assignments using MindReader",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the major hurdles toward automatic semantic understanding of computer
programs is the lack of knowledge about what constitutes functional equivalence
of code segments. We postulate that a sound knowledgebase can be used to
deductively understand code segments in a hierarchical fashion by first
de-constructing a code and then reconstructing it from elementary knowledge and
equivalence rules of elementary code segments. The approach can also be
engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract
algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea
behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a
wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level
programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python. The MindReader system is able
to assess student assignments and guide them how to develop correct and better
code in real time without human assistance.

  Comparison and Application to Maximum Power Forecasting",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the increasing proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) production
in the generation mix, the knowledge of the PV generation capacity has become a
key factor. In this work, we propose to compute the PV plant maximum power
starting from the indirectly-estimated irradiance. Three estimators are
compared in terms of i) ability to compute the PV plant maximum power, ii)
bandwidth and iii) robustness against measurements noise. The approaches rely
on measurements of the DC voltage, current, and cell temperature and on a model
of the PV array. We show that the considered methods can accurately reconstruct
the PV maximum generation even during curtailment periods, i.e. when the
measured PV power is not representative of the maximum potential of the PV
array. Performance evaluation is carried out by using a dedicated experimental
setup on a 14.3 kWp rooftop PV installation. Results also proved that the
analyzed methods can outperform pyranometer-based estimations, with a less
complex sensing system. We show how the obtained PV maximum power values can be
applied to train time series-based solar maximum power forecasting techniques.
This is beneficial when the measured power values, commonly used as training,
are not representative of the maximum PV potential.

structure similar to the faces of a simplex. This paper gives a theoretical
justification for that observation by proving the gluing structure of the
Pareto sets/fronts of subproblems of a simple problem. The simplicity of
standard benchmark problems is studied.
