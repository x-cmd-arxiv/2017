millimeter wave (mmwave) band, this paper studies the beamforming design to
minimize the transmit power while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for
randomly deployed users. First the ideal beampattern is derived via Parseval
Identity, based on which a beamforming design problem is formulated to minimize
the gap with the idea beampattern. The problem is transformable to a
multiconvex one and an iterative optimization algorithm is used to obtain the
full-digital beamformer. In addition, with the help of same beampattern
theorem, the power amplifier (PA) efficiency of the beamformer is improved with
unchanged beampattern. Finally, the practical hybrid implementation is obtained
that achieves the full-digital beamformer solution. Simulations verify the
advantages of the proposed scheme over existing ones.

shift when suitably modified to capture both the nonlinear enhancement of
zonal/drift-wave interactions and the existence of residual Rosenbluth-Hinton
states. This phenomenon persists through numerous simplifications of the
equation, including a quasilinear approximation as well as a four-mode
truncation. It is shown that the use of an appropriate adiabatic electron
response, for which the electrons are not affected by the flux-averaged
potential, results in an $\boldsymbol{E}\boldsymbol{\times}\boldsymbol{B}$
nonlinearity that can efficiently transfer energy nonlocally to length scales
on the order of the sound radius. The size of the shift for the nonlinear
system is heuristically calculated and found to be in excellent agreement with
numerical solutions. The existence of the Dimits shift for this system is then
understood as an ability of the unstable primary modes to efficiently couple to
stable modes at smaller scales, and the shift ends when these stable modes
eventually destabilize as the density gradient is increased. This nonlocal
mechanism of energy transfer is argued to be generically important even for
more physically complete systems.

conclusion of our study is that a single epidemic could drive a species with
high mortality rate to local or even global extinction provided that it is

graph-based method for feature selection that ranks features by identifying the
most important ones into arbitrary set of cues. Mapping the problem on an
affinity graph-where features are the nodes-the solution is given by assessing
the importance of nodes through some indicators of centrality, in particular,
the Eigen-vector Centrality (EC). The gist of EC is to estimate the importance
of a feature as a function of the importance of its neighbors. Ranking central
nodes individuates candidate features, which turn out to be effective from a
classification point of view, as proved by a thoroughly experimental section.
Our approach has been tested on 7 diverse datasets from recent literature

against filter, embedded and wrappers methods. The results are remarkable in

natural disaster, enhancing resilience of a distribution network. To deal with
the stochastic nature of intermittent energy resources, such as wind turbines
(WTs) and photovoltaics (PVs), many methods rely on forecast information.
However, some microgrids may not be equipped with power forecasting tools. To
fill this gap, a risk-limiting strategy based on measurements is proposed.
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to represent a prior joint probability
density function (PDF) of power outputs of WTs and PVs over multiple periods.
As time rolls forward, the distribution of WT/PV generation is updated based
the latest measurement data in a recursive manner. The updated distribution is
used as an input for the risk-limiting load restoration problem, enabling an
equivalent transformation of the original chance constrained problem into a
mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Simulation cases on a distribution
system with three microgrids demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. Results also indicate that networked microgrids have better uncertainty
management capabilities than stand-alone microgrids.

For most of the Jupiters in our sample, we find the detectability of their
atmospheres to be dependent on the planetary radius but not on the planetary
mass. This indicates that planetary gravity plays a secondary role in the state
of gaseous planetary atmospheres. We detect the presence of water vapour in all

presence in the atmospheres of the others. In addition, TiO and/or VO

the topology of the set $\mathcal{F}$ of flat connections on a principal
$G$-bundle $P\,\longrightarrow\, M$. Although the characteristic classes of
principal bundles are trivial when $\mathcal{F}\neq \emptyset$, their classical
Chern-Weil construction can still be exploited to define a homomorphism from
the set of homology classes of maps $S\longrightarrow \mathcal{F}$ to the
cohomology group $H^{2r-k}(M,\mathbb{R})$, where $S$ is null-cobordant
$(k-1)$-manifold, once a $G$-invariant polynomial $p$ of degree $r$ on
$\text{Lie}(G)$ is fixed. For $S=S^{k-1}$, this gives a homomorphism
$\pi_{k-1}(\mathcal{F})\longrightarrow H^{2r-k}(M,\mathbb{R})$. The map is
shown to be globally gauge invariant and furthermore it descends to the moduli
space of flat connections $\mathcal{F}/\mathrm{Gau}P$, modulo cohomology with
integer coefficients. The construction is also adapted to complex manifolds. In
this case, one works with the set $\mathcal{F}^{0,2}$ of connections with
vanishing $(0,2)$-part of the curvature, and the Dolbeault cohomology. Some
examples and applications are presented.

group acting on $M$ effectively and by isometries. It is well known that a
lower bound of the sectional curvature of $(M,g)$ is again a bound for the
curvature of the quotient space, which is an Alexandrov space of curvature
bounded below. Moreover, the analogous stability property holds for metric
foliations and submersions.
  The goal of the paper is to prove the corresponding stability properties for
synthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds. Specifically, we show that such
stability holds for quotients of $\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-spaces, under
isomorphic compact group actions and more generally under metric-measure
foliations and submetries. An $\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-space is a metric measure
space with an upper dimension bound $N$ and weighted Ricci curvature bounded
below by $K$ in a generalized sense. In particular, this shows that if $(M,g)$
has Ricci curvature bounded below by $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and dimension $N$, then
the quotient space is an $\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-space. Additionally, we tackle
the same problem for the $\mathsf{CD}/\mathsf{CD}^*$ and $\mathsf{MCP}$
curvature-dimension conditions.
  We provide as well geometric applications which include: A generalization of
Kobayashi's Classification Theorem of homogenous manifolds to
$\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-spaces with essential minimal dimension $n\leq N$; a
structure theorem for $\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-spaces admitting actions by large
(compact) groups; and geometric rigidity results for orbifolds such as Cheng's
Maximal Diameter and Maximal Volume Rigidity Theorems.
  Finally, in two appendices we apply the methods of the paper to study
quotients by isometric group actions of discrete spaces and of (super-)Ricci
flows.

the most representative problems in this class. This paper deals with its
well-studied generalization called the degree-bounded Steiner forest problem
where the connectivity demands are represented by vertex pairs that need to be

online but the demand pairs arrive sequentially in online steps. The selected

the new connectivity constraint in each online step. The goal is to be
competitive against an adversary that knows the input in advance. We design a
simple greedy-like algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of O(log n)

achieve a (multiplicative) competitive ratio o(log n); thus our result is
asymptotically tight. We further show strong hardness results for the group

appealing to a scaling law of nuclear coalescence with the physical volume of

law with systems ranging from central and off-axis AA collisions to pA

volume scaling to the pp system, HBT data allows us to make a new estimate of
coalescence, that we test against preliminary ALICE pp data. For anti-helium
the resulting cross section is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than earlier
estimates. The astrophysical secondary flux of anti-helium could be within
reach of a five-year exposure of AMS02.

atmospheric structure to converge to a hotter adiabat than the one obtained

challenges for coronagraphic instruments due to the diffraction and aberration
leakage caused by companion stars. Consequently, many scientifically valuable
multi-star systems are excluded from direct imaging target lists for exoplanet

two techniques can be combined to generate high-contrast regions for multi-star

Hopf or Hopf-Hopf bifurcations in any dimension $n\geq4$. Exploiting the
circulant structure of the Jacobian matrix enables us to reduce the first
Lyapunov coefficient to an explicit formula from which it can be determined
when the Hopf bifurcation is sub- or supercritical. The first Hopf bifurcation
for $F>0$ is always supercritical and the periodic orbit born at this
bifurcation has the physical interpretation of a travelling wave. Furthermore,
by unfolding the codimension two Hopf-Hopf bifurcation it is shown to act as an
organising centre, explaining dynamics such as quasi-periodic attractors and
multistability, which are observed in the original Lorenz-96 model. Finally,
the region of parameter values beyond the first Hopf bifurcation value is
investigated numerically and routes to chaos are described using bifurcation

experimental and theoretical researches that consider the entanglement of a
mechanical resonator with a cavity field created by red-detuned continuous-wave
or blue-detuned pulsed driving field, we find that applying blue-detuned
continuous-wave pump field to cavity optomechanical systems can achieve
considerable degrees of quantum entanglement, which is generally challenging to
obtain at high temperature for the known physical systems. The competition
between the induced squeezing-type interaction and the existing decoherence
leads to stable entanglement in dynamically unstable regime. There is a much
more relaxed condition for the existence of entanglement, as compared with the
well-known criterion for neglecting the thermal decoherence on optomechanically
coupled systems. A simple relation about a boundary in the parameter space,
across which the entanglement can exist or not, is found with an analytical
expression for the degree of the achieved entanglement at any temperature,
which is derived for the systems of highly resolved sideband. The studied
scenario with blue-detuned continuous-wave driving field can greatly simplify
the generation of the widely interested optomechanical entanglement of
macroscopic quantum states. Our study also provides the answers to two
fundamentally meaningful open problems: (1) what is the condition for a system
to avoid its loss of quantum entanglement under thermal decoherence? (2) is it
possible to preserve the entanglement in a thermal environment by increasing
the interaction that entangles the subsystems?

ratios of the $B\to K^{(*)}\ell\ell$ decay rates thus point to genuine
manifestations of lepton non-universal new physics. In this paper, we analyse
these measurements in the context of effective field theory. First, we discuss
the interplay of the different operators in $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$ and provide
predictions for $R_{K^*}$ in the Standard Model and in new-physics scenarios
that can explain $R_K$. We also provide approximate numerical formulas for

The SM disagrees with these measurements at $3.7\sigma$ significance. We find
excellent fits in scenarios with combinations of $\mathcal O_{9(10)}^\ell=\bar
s\gamma^\mu b_L~\ell\gamma_\mu(\gamma_5) \ell$ operators, with pulls relative
to the Standard Model in the region of $4\sigma$. An important conclusion of
our analysis is that a lepton-specific contribution to $\mathcal O_{10}$ is
essential to understand the data. Under the hypothesis that new-physics couples
selectively to the muons, we also present fits to other $b\to s\mu\mu$ data

Finally, we discuss new lepton universality ratios that, if new physics is the
origin of the observed discrepancy, should contribute to the statistically
significant discovery of new physics in the near future.

for the forthcoming ultra-deep radio surveys and to allow a full exploitation
of their results to measure the cosmic star formation history. We have
addressed this issue by matching recent accurate determinations of the SFR
function up to high redshifts with literature estimates of the 1.4 GHz
luminosity functions of star forming galaxies (SFGs). This was done considering
two options, proposed in the literature, for the relationship between the
synchrotron emission ($L_{\rm synch}$), that dominates at 1.4 GHz, and the SFR:
a linear relation with a decline of the $L_{\rm synch}$/SFR ratio at low
luminosities or a mildly non-linear relation at all luminosities. In both cases
we get good agreement with the observed radio luminosity functions but, in the
non-linear case, the deviation from linearity must be small. The luminosity
function data are consistent with a moderate increase of the $L_{\rm
synch}$/SFR ratio with increasing redshift, indicated by other data sets,
although a constant ratio cannot be ruled out. A stronger indication of such
increase is provided by recent deep 1.4 GHz counts, down to $\mu$Jy levels.
This is in contradiction with models predicting a decrease of that ratio due to
inverse Compton cooling of relativistic electrons at high redshifts.
Synchrotron losses appear to dominate up to $z\simeq 5$. We have also updated

We focus on [O III] $\lambda$5007/H$\alpha$ and [Ne III] $\lambda$3869/[O II]
$\lambda$3727, studying them with simulations obtained with the CLOUDY
photoionization code. If a sharp quenching is assumed, we find that the two
ratios are very sensitive tracers as they drop by a factor $\sim$ 10 within
$\sim$ 10 Myr from the interruption of the SF; instead, if a smoother and
slower SF decline is assumed (i.e. an exponentially declining star-formation
history with $e$-folding time $\tau=$ 200 Myr), they decrease by a factor
$\sim$ 2 within $\sim$ 80 Myr. We mitigate the ionization -- metallicity
degeneracy affecting our methodology using pairs of emission line ratios
separately related to metallicity and ionization, adopting the [N II]

lower-metallicity halo stars preferentially formed at larger distances

Revision accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx2179",,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.HE math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new mathematical model for $n-k$-dimensional non-linear
correlations with intrinsic scatter in $n$-dimensional data. The model is based
on Riemannian geometry, and is naturally symmetric with respect to the measured
variables and invariant under coordinate transformations. We combine the model
with a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the correlation
relation and the intrinsic scatter. A side benefit of the approach is that
censored and truncated datasets and independent, arbitrary measurement errors
can be incorporated. We also derive analytic likelihoods for the typical
astrophysical use case of linear relations in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.
We pay particular attention to the case of linear regression in two dimensions,
and compare our results to existing methods. Finally, we apply our methodology
to the well-known $M_\text{BH}$-$\sigma$ correlation between the mass of a
supermassive black hole in the centre of a galactic bulge and the corresponding
bulge velocity dispersion. The main result of our analysis is that the most
likely slope of this correlation is $\sim 6$ for the datasets used, rather than
the values in the range $\sim 4$-$5$ typically quoted in the literature for
these data.

moderately face-on view, and a peak outburst luminosity of about 0.3 times the
Eddington luminosity. We discuss the discrepancy between the characteristic
sizes inferred from the short X-ray timescale (R ~ a few 10^{11} cm) and from
the optical emitter (R sqrt[cos theta] ~ 2.2 x 10^{13} cm). One possibility is
that the optical emitter is a circumbinary disk; however, we disfavour this
scenario because it would require a very small donor star. A more plausible
scenario is that the disk is large but only the inner annuli are involved in
the X-ray outburst. We propose that the recurrent outbursts are caused by an
accretion-rate oscillation driven by wind instability in the inner disk. We
argue that the system has a long-term-average accretion rate of a few percent
Eddington, just below the upper limit of the low/hard state; a wind-driven
oscillation can trigger transitions to the high/soft state, with a recurrence
period of ~1 year (much longer than the binary period, which we estimate as ~10
days). The oscillation that dominated the system in the last decade is now
damped such that the accretion rate no longer reaches the level required to
trigger a transition. Finally, we highlight similarities between disk winds in
HLX-1 and in the Galactic black hole V404 Cyg.

around four galaxies - two at $z=0.1$ with stellar masses of $M_{\ast} \sim
10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $M_{\ast} \sim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, and two at $z=3$
with similar stellar masses - out to impact parameters of twice their virial
radii, implementing a fluctuating central source of ionizing radiation. Due to
delayed recombination, the AGN leave significant `AGN proximity zone fossils'
around all four galaxies, where OVI and other metal ions are out of ionization
equilibrium for several megayears after the AGN fade. The column density of OVI
is typically enhanced by $\approx 0.3-1.0$ dex at impact parameters within
$0.3R_{\rm vir}$, and by $\approx 0.06-0.2$ dex at $2R_{\rm vir}$, thereby also
enhancing the covering fraction of OVI above a given column density threshold.
The fossil effect tends to increase with increasing AGN luminosity, and towards
shorter AGN lifetimes and larger AGN duty cycle fractions. In the limit of
short AGN lifetimes, the effect converges to that of a continuous AGN with a
luminosity of $(f_{\rm duty}/100\%)$ times the AGN luminosity. We also find
significant fossil effects for other metal ions, where low-ionization state
ions are decreased (SiIV, CIV at $z=3$) and high-ionization state ions are
increased (CIV at $z=0.1$, NeVIII, MgX). Using observationally motivated AGN

that the clustering strength, r0, and the bias of galaxy populations relative
to the clustering of dark matter increase linearly with H-alpha luminosity
(and, by implication, star-formation rate) at all three redshifts, as do the
host dark matter halo masses of the HiZELS galaxies. The typical galaxies in
our samples are star-forming centrals, residing in halos of mass M_halo ~ a few

between the H-alpha luminosity scaled by the characteristic luminosity,
L(H-alpha)/L(H-alpha)*(z), and the minimum host dark matter halo mass of
central galaxies. This reveals that the dark matter halo environment is a
strong driver of galaxy star-formation rate and therefore of the evolution of
the star-formation rate density in the Universe.

However, recent theoretical studies have suggested that resonant scattering
from rare regions can give rise to a non-zero density of states even at charge
neutrality. Here, we give a detailed account of this effect and demonstrate how

develop a self-consistent T-matrix approach to investigate the density of

and shows that any spatially symmetric solution is in fact steady with a speed
determined by the motion of the axis of symmetry at the initial time. The
second principle includes equations that admit breathers and steady waves, and
therefore is less strong: it holds that the axes of symmetry are constant in
time. The last principle is a mixed case, when the equation contains terms of
the kind from both earlier principles, and there may be different outcomes; for
a class of such equations one obtains that a spatially symmetric solution must
be constant in both time and space. We list and give examples of more than 30
well-known equations and systems in one and several dimensions satisfying these
principles; corresponding results for weak formulations of these equations may
be attained using the same techniques. Our investigation is a generalisation of
a local and one-dimensional version of the first principle from [E., Holden,
and Raynaud, 2009] to nonlocal equations, systems and higher dimensions, as
well as a study of the standing and mixed cases.

non-convexity. The non-convexity indices considered include the Hausdorff
distance induced by any norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the volume deficit (the
difference of volumes), a non-convexity index introduced by Schneider (1975),
and the effective standard deviation or inner radius. After first clarifying
the interrelationships between these various indices of non-convexity, which

their conjecture is proved to be true in dimension 1 and for certain sets $A$

transportation problems for a set of probability measures with finite support.
Discrete barycenters are measures with finite support themselves and exhibit
two favorable properties: there always exists one with a provably sparse
support, and any optimal transport to the input measures is non-mass splitting.
  It is open whether a discrete barycenter can be computed in polynomial time.
It is possible to find an exact barycenter through linear programming, but
these programs may scale exponentially. In this paper, we prove that there is a
strongly-polynomial 2-approximation algorithm based on linear programming.
First, we show that an exact computation over the union of supports of the
input measures gives a tight 2-approximation. This computation can be done
through a linear program with setup and solution in strongly-polynomial time.
The resulting measure is sparse, but an optimal transport may split mass. We
then devise a second, strongly-polynomial algorithm to improve this measure to
one with a non-mass splitting transport of lower cost. The key step is an
update of the possible support set to resolve mass split.
  Finally, we devise an iterative scheme that alternates between these two
algorithms. The algorithm terminates with a 2-approximation that has both a
sparse support and an associated non-mass splitting optimal transport. We
conclude with some sample computations and an analysis of the scaling of our
algorithms, exhibiting vast improvements in running time over exact LP-based
computations and low practical errors.

sensitivity wavefront sensing and control system in a diffraction-limited
regime to achieve segment alignment with nanometric accuracy. In this context,
Zernike wavefront sensors represent promising options for such a calibration. A
concept called the Zernike unit for segment phasing (ZEUS) was previously
developed for ground-based applications to operate under seeing-limited images.
Such a concept is, however, not suitable for fine cophasing with
diffraction-limited images. We revisit ZELDA, a Zernike sensor that was
developed for the measurement of residual aberrations in exoplanet direct
imagers, to measure segment piston, tip, and tilt in the diffraction-limited
regime. We introduce a novel analysis scheme of the sensor signal that relies
on piston, tip, and tilt estimators for each segment, and provide probabilistic
insights to predict the success of a closed-loop correction as a function of
the initial wavefront error. The sensor unambiguously and simultaneously
retrieves segment piston and tip-tilt misalignment. Our scheme allows for
correction of these errors in closed-loop operation down to nearly zero
residuals in a few iterations. This sensor also shows low sensitivity to
misalignment of its parts and high ability for operation with a relatively

red nova. Our prediction is based on the example of the precursor to the red
nova V1309 Sco, which was retrospectively found to be a contact binary with an
exponentially decreasing period. We explore the use of this distinctive timing
signature to identify precursors, developing the observational and analysis
steps needed. We estimate that our Galaxy has roughly 1-10 observable
precursors. Specifically, we lay out the observational case for KIC 9832227,
which we identified as a tentative candidate two years ago (Molnar et al. 2015,
AAS Meeting Abstracts 415.05). Orbital timing over the past two years has
followed the tentative exponential fit. As of late 2015, the period time
derivative went beyond the range found in other systems (dP/dt < 1x10^{-8}), a
necessary criterion for a serious candidate. We estimate time of merger is the
year 2022.2(7). Double absorption line spectra confirm directly the 0.458 d
light curve period is a contact binary system and yield a mass ratio m_B/m_A =
0.228(3). Closer analysis of the Kepler timing data shows evidence of a
component C with orbital period P_C = 590(8) days and m_C x sin i_C = 0.11
solar masses. An alternative interpretation of the long term timing trend,
light travel time delay due to orbit around a distant component D, is ruled out
by the spectroscopic data for any nondegenerate star. Additional measurements
are needed to test further the merging hypothesis and to utilize fully this
fortuitous opportunity.

demonstrate a complete suppression of the undesired runaway mode, along with an

formation and controls the dynamics of the planetesimal-building dust grains.
Accurate gas mass measurements help map the observed properties of
planet-forming disks onto the formation environments of known exoplanets. Rare
isotopologues of carbon monoxide (CO) have been used as gas mass tracers for
disks in the Lupus star-forming region, with an assumed interstellar CO/H$_2$
abundance ratio. Unfortunately, observations of T-Tauri disks show that CO
abundance is not interstellar---a finding reproduced by models that show CO
abundance decreasing both with distance from the star and as a function of
time. Here we present radiative transfer simulations that assess the accuracy
of CO-based disk mass measurements. We find that the combination of CO chemical
depletion in the outer disk and optically thick emission from the inner disk
leads observers to underestimate gas mass by more than an order of magnitude if
they use the standard assumptions of interstellar CO/H$_2$ ratio and optically
thin emission. Furthermore, CO abundance changes on million-year timescales,
introducing an age/mass degeneracy into observations. To reach factor of a few
accuracy for CO-based disk mass measurements, we suggest that observers and
modelers adopt the following strategies: (1) select the low-$J$ transitions;
(2) observe multiple CO isotopologues and use either intensity ratios or
normalized line profiles to diagnose CO chemical depletion; and (3) use
spatially resolved observations to measure the CO abundance distribution.

applied to several one-dimensional structures such as single quantum wells,

  Cyber Security Cryptography and Machine Learning (CSCML 2017)",,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper addresses the problem of emulating a regular register in a
synchronous distributed system where clients invoking ${\sf read}()$ and ${\sf
write}()$ operations are anonymous while server processes maintaining the state
of the register may be compromised by rational adversaries (i.e., a server
might behave as \emph{rational malicious Byzantine} process). We first model
our problem as a Bayesian game between a client and a rational malicious server
where the equilibrium depends on the decisions of the malicious server (behave
correctly and not be detected by clients vs returning a wrong register value to
clients with the risk of being detected and then excluded by the computation).
We prove such equilibrium exists and finally we design a protocol implementing
the regular register that forces the rational malicious server to behave
correctly.

beam's own space charge is typically suppressed by way of neutralization from
either electrons or ions, which originate from ionization of the background
gas. In cases where the beam is chopped, the neutralization pattern changes
throughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to differ
significantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result in
beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative
solution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT
that contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the
transition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low
transverse tails. This report discusses the experimental realization of such a
scheme at Fermilab's PXIE, where low beam emittance dilution was demonstrated.

compositional disorder. The Urbach tail observed in InGaN alloy quantum wells
of solar cells and LEDs by biased photocurrent spectroscopy is shown to be
characteristic of the ternary alloy disorder. The broadening of the absorption
edge observed for quantum wells emitting from violet to green (indium content
ranging from 0 to 28\%) corresponds to a typical Urbach energy of 20~meV. A 3D
absorption model is developed based on a recent theory of disorder-induced
localization which provides the effective potential seen by the localized
carriers without having to resort to the solution of the Schr\""odinger equation
in a disordered potential. This model incorporating compositional disorder
accounts well for the experimental broadening of the Urbach tail of the
absorption edge. For energies below the Urbach tail of the InGaN quantum wells,
type-II well-to-barrier transitions are observed and modeled. This contribution
to the below bandgap absorption is particularly efficient in near-UV emitting
quantum wells. When reverse biasing the device, the well-to-barrier below
bandgap absorption exhibits a red shift, while the Urbach tail corresponding to
the absorption within the quantum wells is blue shifted, due to the partial
compensation of the internal piezoelectric fields by the external bias. The
good agreement between the measured Urbach tail and its modeling by the new
localization theory demonstrates the applicability of the latter to
compositional disorder effects in nitride semiconductors.

the module configurations proposed by these parsers rather than learning them
from data. In this paper, we propose End-to-End Module Networks (N2NMNs), which
learn to reason by directly predicting instance-specific network layouts

percolative transport through paths of minimal energy in the 2D landscape of

the quantum effects involved in carrier transport through such complex

electronic states. Our survey, which spans the spectral range ~550-740 nm,
reveals that, in disagreement with a two-level model, the absorption and
emission dipoles are often misaligned. We relate the dipole misalignment angle
(${\Delta}{\theta}$) to the ZPL Stokes shift (${\Delta}E$) and find that
${\Delta}{\theta}\sim 0{\deg}$ when ${\Delta}E$ corresponds to an allowed h-BN
phonon frequency and that $0{\deg}\leq{\Delta}{\theta}\leq 90{\deg}$ when
${\Delta}E$ exceeds the maximum allowed h-BN phonon frequency. Consequently, a
two-level configuration coordinate model succeeds at describing excitations
mediated by the creation of one optical phonon but fails at describing
excitations that require the creation of multiple phonons. We propose that
direct excitations requiring the creation of multiple phonons are inefficient
due to the low Huang-Rhys factors in h-BN and that these ZPLs are instead
excited indirectly via an intermediate electronic state. This hypothesis is
corroborated by polarization measurements of an individual ZPL excited with two
distinct wavelengths that indicate a single ZPL may be excited by multiple
mechanisms. These findings provide new insight on the nature of the optical

Ladyzhenskaya, Prodi and Serrin as well as Kato and Fujita in 1960s, all the
reductions have been logarithmic in nature, regardless of the functional set up
utilized. More precisely, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an a priori
bound that is algebraically better than the energy-level bound, while keeping
the corresponding regularity criterion at the same level as all the classical
regularity criteria. The mathematics presented was inspired by morphology of
the regions of intense vorticity/velocity gradients observed in computational
simulations of turbulent flows, as well as by the physics of turbulent cascades
and turbulent dissipation.

of dual SMBH scenario. The column density towards the galaxy center was found
to be Compton thin, but no X-ray source was detected. The non-detection of the
X-ray source in the nucleus suggests either there is no obscured actively
accreting SMBH, or there exists an SMBH but has a low accretion rate (i.e.
low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN)). The possibility of the LLAGN was investigated and
found to be unlikely based on the H$\alpha$ luminosity, radio power, and

with semimajor axes between 1.8 and 2 AU, low eccentricities and inclinations
of 16-35 degrees. Recently, it has been proposed that Hungaria asteroids are a
secularly declining population that may be related to the Late Heavy
Bombardment (LHB) impactors (\'Cuk et al. 2012, Bottke et al. 2012). While
\'Cuk et al. (2012) and Bottke et al. (2012) have reproduced a Hungaria-like
population that declined exponentially, the real Hungarias were never confirmed
to be unstable to the same degree. Here we find that the stability of Hungarias
is strongly dependent on the evolution of the eccentricity of Mars, which is
chaotic and unpredictable on Gyr timescales. We find that the high Martian
eccentricity chiefly affects Hungarias through close approaches with Mars,
rather than planetary secular modes. However, current minimum perihelia of
Hungarias (over Myr timescales) are not diagnostic of their long-term stability
due to a number of secular and mean motion resonances affecting the Hungaria
region (Milani et al. 2010). We conclude that planetary chaos makes it
impossible to determine the effective lifetimes of observed Hungarias.
Furthermore, long-term changes of Martian eccentricity could lead to variable
Hungaria loss over time. We speculate that some of the most stable Hungarias
may have been placed in their present orbit when the eccentricity of Mars was
significantly higher than today.

the power of evolutionary systems to discover and exploit useful stepping
stones. Novelty search has shown promise in overcoming deception by collecting
diverse stepping stones, and several algorithms have been proposed that combine
novelty with a more traditional fitness measure to refocus search and help
novelty search scale to more complex domains. However, combinations of novelty
and fitness do not necessarily preserve the stepping stone discovery that
novelty search affords. In several existing methods, competition between
solutions can lead to an unintended loss of diversity. Behavior domination
defines a class of algorithms that avoid this problem, while inheriting
theoretical guarantees from multiobjective optimization. Several existing
algorithms are shown to be in this class, and a new algorithm is introduced
based on fast non-dominated sorting. Experimental results show that this
algorithm outperforms existing approaches in domains that contain useful
stepping stones, and its advantage is sustained with scale. The conclusion is
that behavior domination can help illuminate the complex dynamics of
behavior-driven search, and can thus lead to the design of more scalable and
robust algorithms.

up 75 per cent of the population of the stars in the Galaxy [1]. The
atmospheres of orbiting Earth-sized planets are observationally accessible via
transmission spectroscopy when the planets pass in front of these stars [2,3].
Statistical results suggest that the nearest transiting Earth-sized planet in
the liquid-water, habitable zone of an M dwarf star is probably around 10.5
parsecs away [4]. A temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima
Centauri, the closest M dwarf [5], but it probably does not transit and its
true mass is unknown. Seven Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star
TRAPPIST-1, which is 12 parsecs away [6,7], but their masses and, particularly,
their densities are poorly constrained. Here we report observations of LHS
1140b, a planet with a radius of 1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star
(LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times
that of Earth, consistent with a rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an
insolation of 0.46 times that of Earth, placing it within the liquid-water,
habitable zone [8]. With 90 per cent confidence, we place an upper limit on the
orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The circular orbit is unlikely to be the result
of tides and therefore was probably present at formation. Given its large
surface gravity and cool insolation, the planet may have retained its
atmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared to the present-day) of its
host star in its youth [9,10]. Because LHS 1140 is nearby, telescopes currently
under construction might be able to search for specific atmospheric gases in
the future [2,3].

diffusion of conserved charges and the hydrodynamic viscosities in a baryon
rich quark-gluon plasma are found to be suppressed with respect to the zero net
baryon case. The transition temperatures associated with equilibrium and
non-equilibrium quantities are determined as a function of the baryon chemical
potential for the first time. Because of the crossover nature of the QCD phase
transition even at moderately large values of the chemical potential, we find

catalogs extracted from multi-band photometric surveys. However, these catalogs
are altered by selection effects that are difficult to model, that correlate in
non trivial ways, and that can lead to contradictory predictions if not taken
into account carefully. To address this issue, we have developed a new approach
combining parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL) techniques and
empirical modeling with realistic image simulations that reproduce a large
fraction of these selection effects. This allows us to perform a direct
comparison between observed and simulated images and to infer robust
constraints on model parameters. We use a semi-empirical forward model to
generate a distribution of mock galaxies from a set of physical parameters.
These galaxies are passed through an image simulator reproducing the
instrumental characteristics of any survey and are then extracted in the same
way as the observed data. The discrepancy between the simulated and observed
data is quantified, and minimized with a custom sampling process based on
adaptive Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. Using synthetic data matching most
of the properties of a CFHTLS Deep field, we demonstrate the robustness and
internal consistency of our approach by inferring the parameters governing the
size and luminosity functions and their evolutions for different realistic
populations of galaxies. We also compare the results of our approach with those
obtained from the classical spectral energy distribution fitting and
photometric redshift approach.Our pipeline infers efficiently the luminosity

charges the meteor and creates a strong local electric field. We show how

network densification is shown to be one of the most dominant approaches to
expand network capacity. Due to the scarcity of available spectrum resources,
nevertheless, the over-deployment of network infrastructures, e.g., cellular
base stations (BSs), would strengthen the inter-cell interference as well, thus
in turn deteriorating the system performance. On this account, we investigate
the performance of downlink cellular networks in terms of user coverage
probability (CP) and network spatial throughput (ST), aiming to shed light on
the limitation of network densification. Notably, it is shown that both CP and
ST would be degraded and even diminish to be zero when BS density is
sufficiently large, provided that practical antenna height difference (AHD)
between BSs and users is involved to characterize pathloss. Moreover, the
results also reveal that the increase of network ST is at the expense of the
degradation of CP. Therefore, to balance the tradeoff between user and network
performance, we further study the critical density, under which ST could be
maximized under the CP constraint. Through a special case study, it follows
that the critical density is inversely proportional to the square of AHD. The
results in this work could provide helpful guideline towards the application of
network densification in the next-generation wireless networks.

Universe is strongly suggested by recent observations. However, the accretion
mechanism of SMBHs in dusty gas is not well understood yet. We investigate the
growth of intermediate-mass black-holes (IMBHs) of $\sim 10^{5}~M_{\odot}$ in
dusty clouds by using one-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamics simulations. We
find that the accretion of dusty gas onto IMBHs proceeds gently with small
fluctuations of the accretion rate, whereas that of pristine gas causes more
violent periodic bursts. At dust-to-gas mass ratios similar to the solar
neighborhood, the time averaged luminosity becomes smaller than that for
primordial gas by one order of magnitude and the time-averaged Eddington ratio
ranges from $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-2}$ in clouds with initial gas
densities of $n_{\rm H} = 10 - 1000~\rm cm^{-3}$. Our calculations show that
the effect of dust opacity alone is secondary compared to the radiation
pressure on dust in regulating the BH growth. We also derive spectral energy
distributions at IR bands by calculating dust thermal emission and show that
the flux ratio between $\lambda \lesssim 20~\rm \mu m$ and $\gtrsim 100~\rm \mu
m$ is closely related to the Eddington ratio. Thermal emission from hot dust
near the BH dominates only during the high accretion phase, producing higher
flux density at $\lesssim 20~\rm \mu m$. Therefore, we suggest that the
combinations of MIR observations by JWST and FIR observation by ALMA or Spitzer
can be used to estimate the Eddington ratio of massive BHs.

investigation on the electron-cyclotron-maser instability driven by non-thermal

atmosphere and interplanetary space. It is found that both forward propagating
and backward propagating waves can be excited in the fast ordinary (O) and
extraordinary (X) electromagnetic modes. The growth rates of X1 mode are almost
always weakened by Alfv\'en waves. The average pitch-angle $\phi_0$ of
electrons is a key parameter for the effect of Alfv\'en waves on the growth
rate of modes O1, O2 and X2. For a beam-dominated electron distribution
($\phi_0 \lesssim 30^\circ$ ), the growth rates of the maser instability for
O1, O2 and X2 modes are enhanced with the increase of Alfv\'en wave energy
density. In other conditions, the growth rates of O1, O2 and X2 modes weakened
with increasing Alfv\'en wave intensity, except that the growth of O1 mode may
also be enhanced by Alfv\'en waves for a ring distribution. The results may be
important for us in analyzing the mechanism of radio bursts with various fine

between employment rate and worker's share of national income in an economy.
The model is simplistically and elegantly described by a set of differential
equations that predicts cyclic behavior between the two variables in an
economy. While this model is simplistic, and most likely does not accurately
represent reality, the mathematical modeling of cyclic behavior is attractive
to economists. Cycles are at the heart of many macroeconomic theories and a
mathematical model allows for future predictions to be made. Thus, over the
years, it has been updated and extended. Ishiyama (2001) takes one such
approach at updating the Goodwin model. He considers two countries engaged in
horizontal trade. Through the lens of sheaf theory, this paper describes
Ishiyama's complex model through various dependency diagrams. Sheaves allow us
to encode all information reflected in the equations of the model into a
dependency diagram, yielding a visual representation of the variable
relationship structure. These dependency diagrams are powerful, and much of the
analysis typically done on equations can be done on the diagrams themselves.
Further, these dependency diagrams allow for a new way to consider complex
models, such as Ishiyama's model. More specifically, it also allows us to
analyze his system in a way not previously done. New questions regarding local
sections of this sheaf and their possible extensions to global sections are
considered. These questions lend themselves to unique analysis about the
system. They also provide a practical way to check the accuracy of Ishiyama's
model, which has many obvious benefits. It is meaningful to conduct this
approach to a system of equations given its novelty, its applicability, and its
importance for modeling.

obstacles? One approach is to use a small dataset collected by human experts:
however, high capacity learning algorithms tend to overfit when trained with
little data. An alternative is to use simulation. But the gap between
simulation and real world remains large especially for perception problems. The
reason most research avoids using large-scale real data is the fear of crashes!
In this paper, we propose to bite the bullet and collect a dataset of crashes
itself! We build a drone whose sole purpose is to crash into objects: it
samples naive trajectories and crashes into random objects. We crash our drone
11,500 times to create one of the biggest UAV crash dataset. This dataset
captures the different ways in which a UAV can crash. We use all this negative
flying data in conjunction with positive data sampled from the same
trajectories to learn a simple yet powerful policy for UAV navigation. We show
that this simple self-supervised model is quite effective in navigating the UAV
even in extremely cluttered environments with dynamic obstacles including
humans. For supplementary video see: https://youtu.be/u151hJaGKUo

Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC), allowing to work with composed
statements called Chunks to detect more quasi-invariants. Based on an
optimization idea given on a WHILE language, we provide a transformation method
- reusing ICC concepts and techniques - to compilers. This new analysis
computes an invariance degree for each statement or chunks of statements by
building a new kind of dependency graph, finds the maximum or worst dependency
graph for loops, and recognizes if an entire block is Quasi-Invariant or not.
This block could be an inner loop, and in that case the computational
complexity of the overall program can be decreased. We already implemented a
proof of concept on a toy C parser 1 analysing and transforming the AST

model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of
ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of

Particular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the
hybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed.
While traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of
the electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that
individually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the
consequences of a more detailed description of the molecular environment in
terms of its quantum density matrix (applied in a mean field approximation
level). Such a description makes it possible to account for characteristics
that cannot be described by the dielectric response model: the effects of
dephasing on the molecular response on one hand, and nonlinear response on the
other. It also highlights the still missing important ingredients in the
numerical approach, in particular its limitation to a classical description of
the radiation field and its reliance on a mean field description of the
many-body molecular system. We end our review with an outlook to the near

namely, the inverse intermolecular isotope fractionation from parent ions to
their product ions and the normal intermolecular isotope fractionation from the
product ions to their further dehalogenated product ions. For a compound having
position-distinct isotope ratios, if dehalogenation reacts on only one
position, the intermolecular isotope fractionation taking palace in this
reaction is normal for the detected precursor ion, but ineffective to the
product ion isotope ratio in comparison with that of the total precursor ions.
On the other hand, intramolecular isotope fractionation positively affects the
isotope ratios of product ions only. The chlorine isotopologues of the observed
precursor ions are deduced to never obey binomial distribution, regardless of
what modes of the initial isotopologue distributions of the total precursor
ions are.

solver (POGS) - a convex optimization solver using the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM), for calculating an optimal treatment plan in
rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT). RSBT treatment planning has more degrees
of freedom than conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) due to the
addition of emission direction, and this necessitates a fast optimization
technique to enable clinical usage. // Methods: The multi-helix RSBT (H-RSBT)
delivery technique was considered with five representative cervical cancer
patients. Treatment plans were generated for all patients using the POGS method
and the previously considered commercial solver IBM CPLEX. The rectum, bladder,
sigmoid, high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), and HR-CTV boundary were
the structures considered in our optimization problem, called the asymmetric
dose-volume optimization with smoothness control. Dose calculation resolution
was 1x1x3 mm^3 for all cases. The H-RSBT applicator has 6 helices, with 33.3 mm
of translation along the applicator per helical rotation and 1.7 mm spacing
between dwell positions, yielding 17.5 degree emission angle spacing per 5 mm
along the applicator.// Results: For each patient, HR-CTV D90, HR-CTV D100,
rectum D2cc, sigmoid D2cc, and bladder D2cc matched within 1% for CPLEX and
POGS. Also, we obtained similar EQD2 figures between CPLEX and POGS. POGS was
around 18 times faster than CPLEX. Over all patients, total optimization times
were 32.1-65.4 seconds for CPLEX and 2.1-3.9 seconds for POGS. // Conclusions:
POGS substantially reduced treatment plan optimization time around 18 times for
RSBT with similar HR-CTV D90, OAR D2cc values, and EQD2 figure relative to
CPLEX, which is significant progress toward clinical translation of RSBT. POGS
is also applicable to conventional HDR-BT.

a radically new mechanism. First, we argue that this broad absorption peak

$t_{1u}$ half-filled state to a higher-energy empty $t_{1g}$ state,
dramatically lowered in energy by the large dipole-dipole interaction acting in

of $\big(t_{1u}\big)^2\big(t_{1g}\big)^1$ states. Both long-lived and

Rev. D 95, 044017 (2017)]. We discuss a possible extension of the method of
calculating the bending angle of light to stationary, axisymmetric and
asymptotically flat spacetimes. For this purpose, we consider the light rays on
the equatorial plane in the axisymmetric spacetime. We introduce a spatial
metric to define the bending angle of light in the finite-distance situation.
We show that the proposed bending angle of light is coordinate-invariant by
using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The non-vanishing geodesic curvature of the
photon orbit with the spatial metric is caused in gravitomagnetism, even though
the light ray in the four-dimensional spacetime follows the null geodesic.
Finally, we consider Kerr spacetime as an example in order to examine how the
bending angle of light is computed by the present method. The finite-distance
correction to the gravitomagnetic deflection angle due to the Sun's spin is
around a pico-arcsecond level. The finite-distance corrections for Sgr
A$^{\ast}$ also are estimated to be very small. Therefore, the gravitomagnetic
finite-distance corrections for these objects are unlikely to be observed with

on a set of aggregation units. Such data are omnipresent in epidemiology due to
confidentiality issues: it is much more common to know the county in which an
individual resides, say, than know their exact location in space. Inference for
aggregated data has traditionally made use of models for discrete spatial
variation, for example conditional autoregressive models (CAR). We argue that
such discrete models can be improved from both a scientific and inferential
perspective by using spatiotemporally continuous models to directly model the
aggregated counts. We introduce methods for delivering (limiting) continuous
inference with spatitemporal aggregated count data in which the aggregation
units might change over time and are subject to uncertainty. We illustrate our
methods using two examples: from epidemiology, spatial prediction malaria
incidence in Namibia; and from politics, forecasting voting under the proposed
changes to parlimentary boundaries in the United Kingdom.

of the rigorous and popular approaches is the multiscale approximation method
for continuous time Markov processes. In this approach, by scaling species
abundances and reaction rates, a family of processes parameterized by a scaling
parameter is defined. The limiting process of this family is then used to
approximate the original process. However, we find that such approximations

  A single ConvNet is trained to detect presence of the anatomical structure of

allow the ConvNet to analyze slices of different sizes, spatial pyramid pooling
is applied. After detection, 3D bounding boxes are created by combining the

descending aorta were localized in chest CT scans, the left cardiac ventricle
in cardiac CTA scans, and the liver in abdomen CT scans. Localization was
evaluated using the distances between automatically and manually defined
reference bounding box centroids and walls.
  The best results were achieved in localization of structures with clearly
defined boundaries (e.g. aortic arch) and the worst when the structure boundary

work, we observe that if the closely located plasmonic cube homodimers over
glass or high permittivity dielectric substrate are illuminated with plane wave
polarized parallel to dimer axis, no reversal of optical binding force occurs.
But if we apply the same set-up over a plasmonic substrate, stable Fano
resonance occurs along with the reversal of near field binding force. It is
observed that during such Fano resonance stronger coupling occurs between the
dimers and plasmonic substrate along with the strong enhancement of the
substrate current. Such near field binding force reversals of plasmonic cube
dimers have been explained based on the observed unusual behavior of optical
Lorentz force during the induced stronger Fano resonance and the dipole-dipole
resonance. Although previously reported reversals of near field optical binding
forces were highly sensitive to particle size/shape (i.e. for heterodimers) and
inter-particle distance, our configuration provides much relaxation of those
parameters and hence should be verified experimentally with simpler
experimental set-ups.

quasiprobabilities allow for a full entanglement characterization. As examples
of our general treatment, the cases of N00N states subjected to Gaussian
dephasing and fluctuating atmospheric losses are explicitly studied. In any

contact area decreases logarithmically with the Nayak parameter. By linking the
Nayak parameter with the Hurst exponent (or fractal dimension), we show the
effect of the latter on the true contact area. This effect, undetectable for
surfaces with poor spectral content, is quite strong for surfaces with rich

available numerical results. A phenomenological equation for the contact area

this equation, the pressure-dependent friction coefficient is deduced based on
the adhesive theory of friction. Some observations on Persson's model of rough

further generalize this result to (not necessarily bounded) uniformly

Additionally, we show that $\lim_{t\to 0}\|T_f^{(t)}\|_t=\|f\|_{\infty}$ holds

of publications spread all over Europe but without acknowledging the author. At
the end of 1645, in a state of declining health and pressed by the need to
defend his authorship, Fontana carried out an intense observational campaign,
whose results he hurriedly collected in his Novae Coelestium Terrestriumque
rerum Observationis (1646), the only book he left to posterity. Fontana
observed the Moon's main craters, as the crater Tycho which he named Fons
Major, their radial patterns and the change in their positions due to the
Moon's motions. He observed the gibbosity of Mars at quadrature and, together
with the Jesuit G.B. Zupus, he described the phases of Mercury. Fontana
observed the two - and occasionally three - major bands of Jupiter, and
inferred the rotation movement of the major planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn,
arguing that they could not be attached to an Aristotelian sky. He came close
to revealing the ring structure of Saturn. He also suggested the presence of
additional moons around Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, which prompted a debate that
lasted more than a hundred years. In several places of his book Fontana
repeatedly claimed to have conceived the first positive eyepiece in 1608,
providing a declaration by Zupus to have used his telescope since 1614. This
declaration is still the oldest record mentioning such a device. We finally
suggest that the telescopes depicted in the two Allegory of Sight by J.

are treated explicitly. Dielectric effects are then dealt with implicitly by
computing the spectra upon removal of the solvent molecules and their
replacement with an effective medium, in the spirit of a continuum solvation
model. Our multimodel approach is validated by comparing its predictions with
those of a fully explicit-solvation simulation for cyanidin-3-glucoside

spectra may differ considerably for individual configurations along the
trajectory, their time averages are remarkably similar, thus providing a solid
benchmark of the former and allowing us to save considerably on the computer

proposed methodology is finally demonstrated by the excellent agreement between
its predictions and the absorption spectra of cyanin measured at strong and

parameters for the planet and analysed 70 transit times obtained by the Kepler

that the observed changes in the transit times are probably caused by the
gravitational influence of another body in the system. To determine the mass of
the perturbing body, we have considered the light-time effect and an analytical
approximation of the perturbation model. The solutions resulting from both
methods give comparable results, with an orbital period $P_3\sim$970 days and a
slightly eccentric orbit of the third body. We also showed that this orbit is
nearly coplanar with the orbit of the Neptune-like planet Kepler-410Ab (orbital
period 17.8 days). We propose two possible models for the perturbing body
orbiting a common barycentre with Kepler-410A: (i) a single star with mass at
least 0.906 M$_{\odot}$, (ii) a binary star with the total mass of its
components of at least 2.15 M$_{\odot}$. In both cases the star Kepler-410B is
on a long orbit (period more than 2200 years). Small amplitude variations
($\sim$ 5-8 minutes) detected in O-C residuals can be explained by the stellar
activity of the host star (spots and pulsations), which affects the shape of
the light curve during the transit. The presence of single or binary companion
of mentioned masses heavily affects the total observed flux from the system.
After removing of the flux contamination from Kepler-410A light curve we found
that radius of the transiting planet Kepler-410Ab should be in the range from
about 3.7 to 4.2 R$_{\oplus}$.

Eddy Simulations of the wind and surface pressure at the InSight landing site
and a Green's function ground deformation approach that is subsequently
validated via a detailed comparison with two other methods based on Sorrells'
theory (Sorrels 1971; Sorrels et al. 1971). The horizontal acceleration as a
result of the ground tilt due to the LES turbulence-induced pressure
fluctuations are found to be typically ~2 - 40 nm/s^2 in amplitude, whereas the
direct horizontal acceleration is two orders of magnitude smaller and is thus
negligible in comparison. The vertical accelerations are found to be ~0.1 - 6
nm/s^2 in amplitude.
  We show that under calm conditions, a single-pressure measurement is
representative of the large-scale pressure field (to a distance of several
kilometers), particularly in the prevailing wind direction. However, during
windy conditions, small-scale turbulence results in a reduced correlation
between the pressure signals, and the single-pressure measurement becomes less
representative of the pressure field. Nonetheless, the correlation between the
seismic signal and the pressure signal is found to be higher for the windiest
period because the seismic pressure noise reflects the atmospheric structure
close to the seismometer. In the same way that we reduce the atmospheric
seismic signal by making use of a pressure sensor that is part of the InSight
APSS (Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite), we also the use the synthetic noise data

propose an efficient unsupervised method for generating foreground object
soft-segmentation masks based on automatic selection and learning from highly

efficiently by taking into consideration the spatio-temporal, appearance and
motion consistency of the object during the whole observed sequence. We also
emphasize the role of the contrasting properties between the foreground object

level analysis, on top of which we add a regression model trained on a
descriptor that considers information over groups of pixels and is both
discriminative and invariant to many changes that the object undergoes
throughout the video. We also present theoretical properties of our
unsupervised learning method, that under some mild constraints is guaranteed to
learn a correct discriminative classifier even in the unsupervised case. Our
method achieves competitive and even state of the art results on the

accreting protoplanetary disk exhibits a so-far enigmatic behavior: its
mid-infrared thermal emission is strongly time-variable, even turning the 10
$\mu$m silicate feature from emission to absorption temporarily. Aims. We look
for the reason for the spectral variability at high spatial resolution and at
multiple epochs. Methods. We study the temporal variability of the mid-infrared
interferometric signal, observed with the VLTI/MIDI instrument at six epochs
between 2011 and 2014. We fit a geometric disk model to the observed
interferometric signal to obtain spatial information about the disk. We also
model the mid-infrared spectra by template fitting to characterize the profile
and time dependence of the silicate emission. We use physically motivated
radiative transfer modeling to interpret the mid-infrared interferometric
spectra. Results. The inner disk (r<1-3 au) spectra exhibit a 10 $\mu$m
absorption feature related to amorphous silicate grains. The outer disk (r>1-3
au) spectra show a crystalline silicate feature in emission, similar to the
spectra of comet Hale-Bopp. The striking difference between the inner and outer
disk spectral feature is highly unusual among T Tauri stars. The mid-infrared
variability is dominated by the outer disk. The strength of the silicate
feature changed by more than a factor of two. Between 2011 and 2014 the
half-light radius of the mid-infrared-emitting region decreased from 1.15 to
0.7 au. Conclusions. For the origin of the absorption we discuss four possible
explanations: a cold obscuring envelope, an accretion heated inner disk, a
temperature inversion on the disk surface and a misaligned inner geometry. The
silicate emission in the outer disk can be explained by dusty material high
above the disk plane, whose mass can change with time, possibly due to
turbulence in the disk.

Principle (GUP) that is consistent with the existence of such a maximum

usage of $M \log \sigma + O(M \log \log M)$ (which is asymptotically
non-optimal for smaller $\sigma$ or if $n \ll M$) and a lack of support for

explicit derivation of the rigid limit of quaternionic isometry Ward identities
agreeing with known results. We show that the rigid limit can be achieved,
amongst others, by performing two successive transformations on the covariantly
holomorphic sections $V^{M}\left( z,\bar{z}\right) $ of the special Kahler
manifold: a particular symplectic change followed by a particular Kahler
transformation. We also give a geometric interpretation of the $\eta_{i}$
parameters used in arXiv:1508.01474 to deal with the expansion of the
holomorphic prepotential $\mathcal{F}\left( z\right) $ of the $\mathcal{N}=2$

isometries and an interpretation of the embedding tensor $\vartheta_{M}^{u}$ in
terms of type IIA/IIB mirror symmetry. Moreover, we construct explicit metrics
for a new family of $4r$- dimensional quaternionic manifolds

a particular raga. Are there some specific regions in brain which are activated
when an artist is creating or imaging a raga in his brain. Do the regions
remain the same when the artist is listening to the same raga sung by him.
These are the questions that perplexed neuroscientists for a long time. In this
study we strive to answer these questions by using latest state of the art
techniques to assess brain response. An EEG experiment was conducted for two
eminent performers of Indian classical music, when they mentally created the
imagery of a raga Jay Jayanti in their mind, as well as when they listened to
the same raga. The beauty of Hindustani music lies in the fact that the
musician is himself the composer and recreates the imagery of the raga in his
mind while performing, hence the scope of creative improvisations are immense.
The alpha and theta frequency rhythms were segregated from each of the time
series data and analyzed using robust non MFDXA technique to quantitatively
assess the degree of cross-correlation of each EEG frequency rhythm in
different combination of electrodes from frontal, occipital and temporal lobes.
A strong response was found in the occipital and fronto occipital region during
mental improvisation of the raga, which is an interesting revelation of this
study. Strong retentive features were obtained in regard to both alpha and
theta rhythms in musical listening in the fronto temporal and occipital
temporal region while the features were almost absent in the thinking part.
Further, other specific regions have been identified separately for the two
separate conditions in which the correlations among the different lobes were
the strongest.

brain function can help identify infants at-risk of brain injury. Quantitative
features allow a consistent and reproducible approach to EEG analysis, but only
when all implementation aspects are clearly defined.
  Methods: We detail quantitative features frequently used in neonatal EEG
analysis and present a Matlab software package together with exact
implementation details for all features. The feature set includes stationary
features that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and features of
inter-hemispheric connectivity. The software, a Neonatal Eeg featURe set in
mAtLab (NEURAL), is open source and freely available. The software also
includes a pre-processing stage with a basic artefact removal procedure.
  Conclusions: NEURAL provides a common platform for quantitative analysis of
neonatal EEG. This will support reproducible research and enable comparisons
across independent studies. These features present summary measures of the EEG
that can also be used in automated methods to determine brain development and
health of the newborn in critical care.

Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 5 catalog with the goal of
identifying and characterizing all very metal-poor stars observed by the
survey. Using a three-stage method, we first identified the candidate stars
using only their spectra as input information. We employed an algorithm called
t-SNE to construct a low-dimensional projection of the spectrum space and
isolate the region containing metal-poor stars. Following this step, we
measured the equivalent widths of the near-infrared CaII triplet lines with a
method based on flexible Gaussian processes to model the correlated noise
present in the spectra. In the last step, we constructed a calibration relation
that converts the measured equivalent widths and the color information coming
from the 2MASS and WISE surveys into metallicity and temperature estimates. We
identified 877 stars with at least a 50% probability of being very metal-poor
$(\rm [Fe/H] < -2\,\rm dex)$, out of which 43 are likely extremely metal-poor
$(\rm [Fe/H] < -3\,\rm dex )$. The comparison of the derived values to a small
subsample of stars with literature metallicity values shows that our method
works reliably and correctly estimates the uncertainties, which typically have
values $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} \approx 0.2\,\mathrm{dex}$. In addition, when
compared to the metallicity results derived using the RAVE DR5 pipeline, it is
evident that we achieve better accuracy than the pipeline and therefore more
reliably evaluate the very metal-poor subsample. Based on the repeated
observations of the same stars, our method gives very consistent results. The
method used in this work can also easily be extended to other large-scale data
sets, including to the data from the Gaia mission and the upcoming 4MOST
survey.

plays a crucial role in both the processes of acceleration and transport of

research have been mainly in the direction of exploring non-linear aspects of
the processes in which these particles are involved, namely the action of
cosmic rays on the environment in which the transport and/or acceleration take
place. When cosmic rays propagate outside of the acceleration region, such
action is mainly in two forms: 1) they generate hydromagnetic waves, through
streaming instabilities, leading to a dependence of the scattering properties
of the medium on the spectrum and spatial distribution of the energetic
particles, and 2) they exert a dynamical action on the plasma, which may cause
the launching of cosmic ray driven Galactic winds. In this article we discuss
these and other recent developments and how they compare with the bulk of new
observations on the spectra of primary nuclei (mainly H and He) and secondary
to primary ratios, such as the B/C ratio and the $\bar p$/ratio, and the
positrons ratio $e^+/(e^-+e^+)$. We also comment on some radically new models

exponents admit a variational representation and are related by the
Golden-Thompson inequality, reaffirming that Dalai's expression is stronger in
general classical-quantum channels. Second, we establish a sphere-packing bound

from the order of subexponential to polynomial. Furthermore, the gap between
the obtained error exponent for constant composition codes and the best known
classical random coding exponent vanishes in the order of $o(\log n / n)$,
indicating our sphere-packing bound is almost exact in the high rate regime.
Finally, for a special class of symmetric classical-quantum channels, we can
completely characterize its optimal error probability without the constant

performed over a wide frequency and temperature range giving insight into spin
dynamics, spin structure, and magnetic anisotropy of this compound. By
analyzing the angular dependence of ESR parameters (resonance shift and
linewidth) at room temperature we show that the two weakly coupled inequivalent
spin chain types inside the compound are well described by Heisenberg-Ising
chains with their magnetic anisotropy axes perpendicular to the chain direction
and almost perpendicular to each other. We further determine the full
$g$-tensor from these data. In addition, the angular dependence of the
linewidth at high temperatures gives us access to the exponent of the algebraic
decay of a dynamical correlation function of the isotropic Heisenberg chain.
From the temperature dependence of static susceptibilities we extract the
strength of the exchange coupling ($J/k_B = 52.0\,\text{K}$) and the anisotropy
parameter ($\delta\approx -0.02$) of the model Hamiltonian. An independent
compatible value of $\delta$ is obtained by comparing the exact prediction for
the resonance shift at low temperatures with high-frequency ESR data recorded
at $4\,\text{K}$. The spin structure in the ordered state implied by the two
(almost) perpendicular anisotropy axes is in accordance with the propagation
vector determined from neutron scattering experiments. In addition to undoped
samples we study the impact of partial substitution of Br by Cl ions on spin
dynamics. From the dependence of the ESR linewidth on doping level we infer an
effective decoupling of the anisotropic component $J\delta$ from the isotropic
exchange $J$ in these systems.

when two treatment levels are compared ignoring the third option of neither
treatment, in `censoring by death' settings where treatment is only defined for
those who survive long enough to receive it, or in general in studies where the
treatment is only defined for a subset of the population. Unfortunately, the
standard instrumental variable (IV) estimand is not defined in the presence of
such selection, so we consider estimating a new survivor-complier causal
effect. Although this effect is generally not identified under standard IV
assumptions, it is possible to construct sharp bounds. We derive these bounds
and give a corresponding data-driven sensitivity analysis, along with
nonparametric yet efficient estimation methods. Importantly, our approach
allows for high-dimensional confounding adjustment, and valid inference even
after employing machine learning. Incorporating covariates can tighten bounds
dramatically, especially when they are strong predictors of the selection
process. We apply the methods in a UK cohort study of critical care patients to
examine the mortality effects of prompt admission to the intensive care unit,
using ICU bed availability as an instrument.

used to measure dependencies between degrees of neighbor nodes in a network. We
formally analyze ANND in undirected random graphs when the graph size tends to
infinity. The limiting behavior of ANND depends on the variance of the degree
distribution. When the variance is finite, the ANND has a deterministic limit.
When the variance is infinite, the ANND scales with the size of the graph, and
we prove a corresponding central limit theorem in the configuration model (CM,
a network with random connections). As ANND proved uninformative in the
infinite variance scenario, we propose an alternative measure, the average
nearest neighbor rank (ANNR). We prove that ANNR converges to a deterministic
function whenever the degree distribution has finite mean. We then consider the
erased configuration model (ECM), where self-loops and multiple edges are
removed, and investigate the well-known `structural negative correlations', or
`finite-size effects', that arise in simple graphs, such as ECM, because large
nodes can only have a limited number of large neighbors. Interestingly, we
prove that for any fixed $k$, ANNR in ECM converges to the same limit as in CM.
However, numerical experiments show that finite-size effects occur when $k$
scales with $n$.

C-RAN is the huge data rate required for fronthauling. To address this issue,
we employ hybrid radio frequency (RF)/free space optical (FSO) systems for the
fronthaul links as they benefit from both the large data rates of FSO links and
the reliability of RF links. To efficiently exploit the fronthaul capacity, the
RUs employ vector quantization to jointly compress the signals received at
their antennas. Moreover, due to the limited available RF spectrum, we assume
that the RF multiple-access and fronthaul links employ the same RF resources.
Thereby, we propose an adaptive protocol which allocates transmission time to
the RF multiple-access and fronthaul links in a time division duplex (TDD)
manner and optimizes the quantization noise covariance matrix at each RU such
that the sum rate is maximized. Our simulation results reveal that a
considerable gain in terms of sum rate can be achieved by the proposed protocol

in Ca isotope composition ($\delta^{44/40}Ca$ = +0.91 to +1.06 permill).
Chondrules from Allende are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Ca compared to
the bulk and the matrix of the meteorite ($\delta^{44/40}Ca$ = +1.00 to +1.21
permill). This implies that Earth and Mars have Ca isotope compositions that
are distinct from most carbonaceous chondrites but that may be like chondrules.
This Ca isotopic similarity between Earth, Mars, and chondrules is permissive
of recent dynamical models of planetary formation that propose a chondrule-rich
accretion model for planetary embryos.

collection of intersecting balls. A Cech complex is a collection of nerves that
cover $K$. Cech nerves are proximal, provided the nerves are close to each
other, either spatially or descriptively. A Cech nerve has an advantage over
the usual Alexandroff nerve, since we need only identify the center and fixed
radius of each ball in a Cech nerve instead of identifying the three vertices
of intersecting filled triangles (2-simplexes) in an Alexandroff nerve. As a
result, Cech nerves more easily cover $K$ and facilitate approximation of the
shapes of irregular finite, bounded planar regions. A main result of this

coefficients periodic with respect to a lattice $\G$, e.g. Schr\""{o}dinger
operator $(i^{-1}\partial/\partial_x-A(x))^2+V(x)$ with periodic magnetic and
electric potentials $A,V$, or a Maxwell operator $\nabla\times\varepsilon
(x)^{-1}\nabla\times$ in a periodic medium. Let also $S$ be a finite part of
its spectrum separated by gaps from the rest of the spectrum. We address here
the question of existence of a finite set of exponentially decaying Wannier
functions $w_j(x)$ such that their $\G$-shifts $w_{j,\g}(x)=w_j(x-\g)$ for
$\g\in\G$ span the whole spectral subspace corresponding to $S$. It was shown
by D.~Thouless in 1984 that a topological obstruction sometimes exists to
finding exponentially decaying $w_{j,\g}$ that form an orthonormal (or any)
basis of the spectral subspace. This obstruction has the form of non-triviality
of certain finite dimensional (with the dimension equal to the number of
spectral bands in $S$) analytic vector bundle (Bloch bundle). It was shown in
2009 by one of the authors that it is always possible to find a finite number
$l$ of exponentially decaying Wannier functions $w_j$ such that their
$\G$-shifts form a tight (Parseval) frame in the spectral subspace. This
appears to be the best one can do when the topological obstruction is present.
Here we significantly improve the estimate on the number of extra Wannier
functions needed, showing that in physical dimensions the number $l$ can be
chosen equal to $m+1$, i.e. only one extra family of Wannier functions is
required. This is the lowest number possible in the presence of the topological
obstacle. The result for dimension four is also stated (without a proof), in
which case $m+2$ functions are needed.
  The main result of the paper was announced without a proof in Bull. AMS, July
2016.

steerability in the continuous variable case via a notion of state-channel

systems. It assumes that the underneath rating matrix is low-rank. However,
this assumption can be too restrictive to capture complex relationships and
interactions among users and items. Recently, Local LOw-Rank Matrix
Approximation (LLORMA) has been shown to be very successful in addressing this
issue. It just assumes the rating matrix is composed of a number of low-rank
submatrices constructed from subsets of similar users and items. Although
LLORMA outperforms MF, how to construct such submatrices remains a big problem.
Motivated by the availability of rich social connections in today's
recommendation systems, we propose a novel framework, i.e., Social LOcal
low-rank Matrix Approximation (SLOMA), to address this problem. To the best of
our knowledge, SLOMA is the first work to incorporate social connections into
the local low-rank framework. Furthermore, we enhance SLOMA by applying social
regularization to submatrices factorization, denoted as SLOMA++. Therefore, the
proposed model can benefit from both social recommendation and the local
low-rank assumption. Experimental results from two real-world datasets, Yelp

rounds, and the time-complexity of a distributed algorithm is classically
defined as the number of rounds before all computing nodes have output. Hence,
this complexity measure captures the running time of the slowest node(s). In
this paper, we are interested in the running time of the ordinary nodes, to be
compared with the running time of the slowest nodes. The node-averaged
time-complexity of a distributed algorithm on a given instance is defined as
the average, taken over every node of the instance, of the number of rounds
before that node output. We compare the node-averaged time-complexity with the
classical one in the standard LOCAL model for distributed network computing. We
show that there can be an exponential gap between the node-averaged
time-complexity and the classical time-complexity, as witnessed by, e.g.,
leader election. Our first main result is a positive one, stating that, in
fact, the two time-complexities behave the same for a large class of problems
on very sparse graphs. In particular, we show that, for LCL problems on cycles,
the node-averaged time complexity is of the same order of magnitude as the
slowest node time-complexity.
  In addition, in the LOCAL model, the time-complexity is computed as a worst
case over all possible identity assignments to the nodes of the network. In
this paper, we also investigate the ID-averaged time-complexity, when the
number of rounds is averaged over all possible identity assignments. Our second
main result is that the ID-averaged time-complexity is essentially the same as
the expected time-complexity of randomized algorithms (where the expectation is
taken over all possible random bits used by the nodes, and the number of rounds
is measured for the worst-case identity assignment).
  Finally, we study the node-averaged ID-averaged time-complexity.

unexpected voltage fluctuations that grow in magnitude as $T$ is decreased

independent of the drive current and contact spacing distance.
Magnetoresistance fluctuations are also observed, which are reminiscent of
universal conductance fluctuations but not entirely consistent with their
conventional properties. Candidate explanations are considered, and a mechanism
is suggested based on mesoscopic temporal fluctuations of the Seebeck

Oguri using the Matsubara formalisum, for the linear conductance through a
central, interacting region coupled to non-interacting fermionic leads. Our
starting point is the well-known Meir-Wingreen formula for the current, whose
derivative w.r.t.\ to the source-drain voltage yields the conductance. We
perform this derivative analytically, by exploiting an exact flow equation from
the functional renormalization group, which expresses the flow w.r.t.\ voltage
of the self-energy in terms of the two-particle vertex. This yields a
Keldysh-based formulation of Oguri's formula for the linear conductance, which
facilitates applying it in the context of approximation schemes formulated in
the Keldysh formalism. (Generalizing our approach to the non-linear conductance
is straightforward, but not pursued here.) -- We illustrate our linear
conductance formula within the context of a model that has previously been
shown to capture the essential physics of a quantum point contact in the regime
of the 0.7 anomaly. The model involves a tight-binding chain with a
one-dimensional potential barrier and onsite interactions, which we treat using
second order perturbation theory. We show that numerical costs can be reduced
significantly by using a non-uniform lattice spacing, chosen such that the
occurence of artificial bound states close to the upper band edge is avoided.

consider all the features and the corresponding descriptors without embedding
their location in the image. This paper presents a new variant of the
well-known VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) embedding technique
which accounts, at a certain degree, for the location of features. The driving
motivation comes from the observation that, usually, the most interesting part
of an image (e.g., the landmark to be recognized) is almost at the center of
the image, while the features at the borders are irrelevant features which do
no depend on the landmark. The proposed variant, called locVLAD (location-aware
VLAD), computes the mean of the two global descriptors: the VLAD executed on
the entire original image, and the one computed on a cropped image which
removes a certain percentage of the image borders. This simple variant shows an
accuracy greater than the existing state-of-the-art approach. Experiments are
conducted on two public datasets (ZuBuD and Holidays) which are used both for

sensitivity offered by a mission like CORE, together with its high resolution
over a wide frequency range, will provide a more accurate estimate of the CMB
dipole. The extension of boosting effects to polarization and
cross-correlations will enable a more robust determination of purely
velocity-driven effects that are not degenerate with the intrinsic CMB dipole,
allowing us to achieve a S/N ratio of 13; this improves on the Planck detection
and essentially equals that of an ideal cosmic-variance-limited experiment up
to a multipole l of 2000. Precise inter-frequency calibration will offer the
opportunity to constrain or even detect CMB spectral distortions, particularly
from the cosmological reionization, because of the frequency dependence of the
dipole spectrum, without resorting to precise absolute calibration. The
expected improvement with respect to COBE-FIRAS in the recovery of distortion
parameters (in principle, a factor of several hundred for an ideal experiment
with the CORE configuration) ranges from a factor of several up to about 50,
depending on the quality of foreground removal and relative calibration. Even
for 1% accuracy in both foreground removal and relative calibration at an
angular scale of 1 deg, we find that dipole analyses for a mission like CORE
will be able to improve the recovery of the CIB spectrum amplitude by a factor
of 17 in comparison with current results based on FIRAS. In addition to the
scientific potential of a mission like CORE for these analyses, synergies with
other planned and ongoing projects are also discussed.

advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct
objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types.
In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in
homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The
classical definition of RP(n), as the quotient space identifying antipodal
points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory.
Instead, we define RP(n) by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological
bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take RP(-1) to be the empty
type. In the inductive step, we take RP(n+1) to be the mapping cone of the
projection map of the tautological bundle of RP(n), and we use its universal
property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RP(n+1).
  By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RP(n) is the
n-sphere, we retrieve the classical description of RP(n+1) as RP(n) with an
(n+1)-cell attached to it. The infinite dimensional real projective space,
defined as the sequential colimit of the RP(n) with the canonical inclusion
maps, is equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2Z,1), which here arises
as the subtype of the universe consisting of 2-element types. Indeed, the
infinite dimensional projective space classifies the 0-sphere bundles, which
one can think of as synthetic line bundles.
  These constructions in homotopy type theory further illustrate the utility of
homotopy type theory, including the interplay of type theoretic and homotopy
theoretic ideas.

Ori has undergone an accretion outburst in 2015 September. The maximum
brightness (DV > 4 mag) was reached in 2015 December and was maintained for
several months. Since 2016 September, the source is in a declining phase.
Photometry and low/ high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained with MODS and
LUCI2 at the {\it Large Binocular Telescope}, with the facilities at the Asiago
1.22 and 1.82 m telescopes, and with GIANO at the {\it Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo}. The spectra are dominated by emission lines of \hi\ and neutral
metallic species. From line and continuum analysis we derive the mass accretion
rate and its evolution during the outburst. Considering that extinction may
vary between 1.5 and 2.9 mag, we obtain m_acc= 0.3$-$2.0 10$^{-8}$ m_sun/yr, in
quiescence and m_acc= 0.2$-$1.9 10$^{-6}$ m_sun/yr, at the outburst peak. The
Balmer decrement shape has been interpreted by means of line excitation models,
finding that from quiescence to outburst peak, the electron density has
increased from $\sim$ 2 10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\sim$ 4 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. The
profiles of the metallic lines are symmetric and narrower than 100 km s$^{-1}$,
while \hi\, and \hei\,\,lines show prominent wings extending up to $\pm$ 500 km
s$^{-1}$. The metallic lines likely originate at the base of the accretion
columns, where neutrals are efficiently shielded against the ionizing photons,
while faster ionized gas is closer to the star. Outflowing activity is
testified by the detection of a variable P Cyg-like profile of the H$\alpha$
and \hei\, 1.08\,$\mu$m lines.

been computed at NLO QCD and EW: vector-boson production in association with
jets, off-shell Z-boson pair production, and the production of a top-quark pair

when considering QCD corrections, all functionalities of Sherpa, i.e. particle
decays, QCD parton showers, hadronisation, underlying events, etc. can be used

ringdown or quasinormal modes (QNMs), which may very well be sensitive to the
state of the interior. We put this idea to the test with a recent proposal that
the interior of a BH consists of a bound state of highly excited, long, closed,
interacting strings; figuratively, a collapsed polymer. We show that such BHs
do indeed have a distinct signature in their QNM spectrum: A new class of modes
whose frequencies are parametrically lower than the lowest-frequency mode of a
classical BH and whose damping times are parametrically longer. The reason for
the appearance of the new modes is that our model contains another scale, the
string length, which is parametrically larger than the Planck length. This
distinction between the collapsed-polymer model and general-relativistic BHs

potentially measuring the strength of the coupling in string theory. For

coupling near the regime which is predicted by the unification of the

for the interior of a charged black hole -approaching a sub-extremal
Reissner-Nordstr\""om background fast enough at infinity- in presence of a
massive and charged scalar field, motivated by the strong cosmic censorship
conjecture in that setting :
  1. Stability : We prove that spherically symmetric characteristic initial
data to the Einstein-Maxwell- Klein-Gordon equations approaching a
Reissner-Nordstr\""om background with a sufficiently decaying polynomial decay
rate on the event horizon gives rise to a space-time possessing a Cauchy
horizon in a neighbourhood of time-like infinity. Moreover if the decay is even
stronger, we prove that the spacetime metric admits a continuous extension to
the Cauchy horizon. This generalizes the celebrated stability result of
Dafermos for Einstein-Maxwell-real-scalar-field in spherical symmetry.
  2. Instability : We prove that for the class of space-times considered in the
stability part, whose scalar field in addition obeys a polynomial averaged-L^2
(consistent) lower bound on the event horizon, the scalar field obeys an
integrated lower bound transversally to the Cauchy horizon. As a consequence we
prove that the non-degenerate energy is infinite on any null surface crossing
the Cauchy horizon and the curvature of a geodesic vector field blows up at the
Cauchy horizon near time-like infinity. This generalizes an instability result
due to Luk and Oh for Einstein-Maxwell-real-scalar-field in spherical symmetry.
  This instability of the black hole interior can also be viewed as a step
towards the resolution of the C^2 strong cosmic censorship conjecture for
one-ended asymptotically initial data.

superradiance can trigger an instability that spins down black holes. This
leads to peculiar gravitational-wave signatures and distribution in the
spin-mass plane, which in turn can impose stringent constraints on ultralight
fields. Here, we demonstrate that there is an analogous spindown effect for
conducting stars. We show that rotating stars amplify low frequency
electromagnetic waves, and that this effect is largest when the time scale for
conduction within the star is of the order of a light crossing time. This has
interesting consequences for dark photons, as massive dark photons would cause
stars to spin down due to superradiant instabilities. The time scale of the
spindown depends on the mass of the dark photon, and on the rotation rate,
compactness, and conductivity of the star. Existing measurements of the
spindown rate of pulsars place direct constraints on models of dark sectors.
Our analysis suggests that dark photons of mass $m_V \sim 10^{-12}$ eV are
excluded by pulsar-timing observations. These constraints also exclude
superradiant instabilities triggered by dark photons as an explanation for the
spin limit of observed pulsars.

to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in a wide wavelength range from 5 to
20 micrometer. By our previous quantum chemistry calculation, it was suggested
that a molecule group having hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon combined skeleton
could reproduce ubiquitous interstellar infrared spectrum. In this paper,
observed NGC2023 spectrum was compared in detail with such carrier candidates.
First model molecule was di-cation (C23H12)2+ with two hydrocarbon pentagons
combined with five hexagons. Observed strong infrared bands were 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,
and 11.2 micrometer. Whereas, calculated strong peaks were 6.4, 7.5, 7.7, 8.5,
and 11.2 micrometer. Observed weaker bands from 10 to 15 micrometer were 11.0,
12.0, 12.7, 13.5, and 14.2 micrometer, which were reproduced well by computed
bands as 10.9, 12.0, 12.6, 13.6, and 14.0 micrometer. From 15 to 20 micrometer,
observed 15.8, 16.4, 17.4, 17.8, and 19.0 micrometer were correlated with
calculated 15.6, 16.5, 17.2, 18.2, and 18.8 micrometer. It should be noted that
we could successfully reproduce interstellar infrared spectrum by applying a
single molecule. Second model molecule was (C12H8)3+ with one pentagon combined
with two hexagons. Again, observed strong bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2 and 12.7
micrometer were successfully computed as 6.3, 7.4, 7.7, 8.6, 11.1, and 12.8
micrometer. It was concluded that by introducing hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon
combined ionized molecules, interstellar PAH oriented infrared spectrum could
be successfully reproduced.

covered by central power plants today, can be supplied in the future.
  In this work, we estimate the future technical potential of such an approach
for the whole of Germany. For a 100% renewable electricity scenario we set the
possible reactive power supply in comparison with the reactive power
requirements that are needed to realize the simulated future transmission grid
power flows. Since an exact calculation of distribution grids' reactive power
potential is difficult due to the unavailability of detailed grid models on
such scale, we optimistically estimate the potential by assuming a scaled,
averaged distribution grid model connected to each of the transmission grid
nodes.
  We find that for all except a few transmission grid nodes, the required
reactive power can be fully supplied from the modeled distribution grids. This
implies that - even if our estimate is overly optimistic - distributed reactive
power provisioning will be a technical solution for many future reactive power
challenges.

different proportions of ethanol (10%, 30%, and 50% by vol.) are investigated
in the present study. The large volatility differential between ethanol and Jet
A-1 and the nominal immiscibility of the fuels seem to result in combustion
characteristics that are rather different from our previous work on butanol/Jet
A-1 droplets (miscible blends). Abrupt explosion was facilitated in fuel
droplets comprising lower proportions of ethanol (10%), possibly due to
insufficient nucleation sites inside the droplet and the partially unmixed fuel
mixture. For the fuel droplets containing higher proportions of ethanol (30%
and 50%), micro-explosion occurred through homogeneous nucleation, leading to
the ejection of secondary droplets and subsequent significant reduction in the
overall droplet lifetime. The rate of bubble growth is nearly similar in all
the blends of ethanol; however, the evolution of ethanol vapor bubble is
significantly faster than that of a vapor bubble in the blends of butanol. The
probability of disruptive behavior is considerably higher in ethanol/Jet A-1
blends than that of butanol/Jet A-1 blends. The Sauter mean diameter of the
secondary droplets produced from micro-explosion is larger for blends with a
higher proportion of ethanol. Both abrupt explosion and micro-explosion create
a large-scale distortion of the flame, which surrounds the parent droplet. The
secondary droplets generated from abrupt explosion undergo rapid evaporation
whereas the secondary droplets from micro-explosion carry their individual
flame and evaporate slowly. The growth of vapor bubble was also witnessed in
the secondary droplets, which leads to the further breakup of the droplet
(puffing/micro-explosion).

variety of different materials. However, the optimum properties of such CS
materials are not well understood. In this context, through detailed analytical
and numerical modeling, here we provide several interesting insights on the
efficiency tradeoff with CS material properties. First, we show that perfect
band alignment is a desirable feature only if the interface is devoid of any
trap states. Otherwise, a band offset of around 0.2eV-0.4eV provides sufficient
band bending to reduce the effect of interface recombination, thus improving
the performance. Surprisingly, the interface passivation quality for the
minority carrier extraction layer is found to be far less demanding than that
for the majority carrier extraction layer. Additionally, doping density and
dielectric constant of CS layers have a similar effect as band offset on solar
cell performance. Our results have obvious implications toward the selection of
appropriate materials as carrier selective layers and hence are of broad
interest to the community.

popular for rapid prototyping, but has remained relatively marginal beyond the

aerospace structures with printed builds, additive manufacturing has largely
remained limited to prototyping, tooling, fixtures, and non-critical
components. There are numerous fundamental challenges inherent to additive
processing to be addressed before this promise is realized. One ubiquitous
challenge across all AM motifs is to develop processing-property relationships
through precise, in situ monitoring coupled with formal methods and feedback
control. We suggest a significant component of this vision is a set of semantic
layers within 3D printing files relevant to the desired material
specifications. This semantic layer provides the feedback laws of the control
system, which then evaluates the component during processing and intelligently
evolves the build parameters within boundaries defined by semantic
specifications. This evaluation and correction loop requires on-the-fly
coupling of finite element analysis and topology optimization. The required
parameters for this analysis are all extracted from the semantic layer and can
be modified in situ to satisfy the global specifications. Therefore, the
representation of what is printed changes during the printing process to
compensate for eventual imprecision or drift arising during the manufacturing
