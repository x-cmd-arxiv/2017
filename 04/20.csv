denoted NS, is universal in the following sense: every normal ideal, and every
tower of normal ideals of inaccessible height, is a canonical Rudin-Keisler
projection of the restriction of $\text{NS}$ to some stationary set. We
investigate how far Burke's theorem can be pushed, by analyzing the
universality properties of NS with respect to the wider class of
\emph{$\mathcal{C}$-systems of filters} introduced by Audrito-Steila
\cite{AudritoSteila}. First we answer a question of \cite{AudritoSteila}, by
proving that $\mathcal{C}$-systems of filters do not capture all kinds of
set-generic embeddings. We provide a characterization of supercompactness in
terms of short extenders and canonical projections of NS, without any reference
to the strength of the extenders; as a corollary, NS can consistently fail to
canonically project to arbitrarily strong short extenders. We prove that
$\omega$-cofinal towers of normal ultrafilters---e.g.\ the kind used to
characterize I2 and I3 embeddings---are well-founded if and only if they are
canonical projections of NS. Finally, we provide a characterization of
""$\aleph_\omega$ is Jonsson"" in terms of canonical projections of NS.

the 3-dimensional space, parallel and orthogonal to the direction of the field
lines. The convergence, or the divergence, of the latter is monitored by the
associated Raychaudhuri equation, which is obtained by propagating the spatial
divergence of a unitary spacelike vector along its own direction. Applied to a
magnetic vector, the resulting expression shows that, although the convergence
of the magnetic forcelines is affected by the gravitational pull of all the
other sources, it is unaffected by the field's own gravity, irrespective of how
strong the latter is. This rather counterintuitive result is entirely due to
the magnetic tension, namely to the negative pressure the field exerts parallel
to its lines of force. In particular, the magnetic tension always cancels out
the field's energy-density input to the Raychaudhuri equation, leaving the
latter free of any direct magnetic-energy contribution. Similarly, the rotation
and the shear deformation of the aforementioned forcelines are also unaffected
by the magnetic input to the total gravitational energy. In a sense, the
magnetic lines do not seem to ""feel"" their own gravity no matter how strong the
latter may be.

The units with semantics are given labels across a range of objects, parts,
scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed method to test the
hypothesis that interpretability of units is equivalent to random linear
combinations of units, then we apply our method to compare the latent
representations of various networks when trained to solve different supervised
and self-supervised training tasks. We further analyze the effect of training
iterations, compare networks trained with different initializations, examine
the impact of network depth and width, and measure the effect of dropout and
batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can shed light on characteristics of CNN

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa6ea7",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rate-equation models are a widely-used and inexpensive tool for the
simulation of interstellar chemistry under a range of physical conditions.
However, their application to grain-surface chemical systems necessitates a
number of simplifying assumptions, due to the requirement to treat only the
total population of each species, using averaged rates, rather than treating
each surface particle as an independent entity. While the outputs from
rate-equation models are strictly limited to such population information, the
inputs -- in the form of the averaged rates that control the time-evolution of
chemical populations -- can be guided by the results from more exact simulation
methods. Here, we examine the effects of back-diffusion, wherein particles
diffusing on a surface revisit binding sites on the lattice, slowing the total
reaction rate. While this effect has been studied for two-particle systems, its
influence at greater surface coverage of reactants has not been explored.
Results from two Monte Carlo kinetics models (one a 2-D periodic lattice, the
other the surface of a three dimensionally-realized grain) were used to develop
a means to incorporate the grain-surface back-diffusion effect into
rate-equation methods. The effects of grain size, grain morphology, and surface
coverage on the magnitude of the back-diffusion effect were studied for the
simple H+H reaction system. The results were fit with expressions that can be
easily incorporated into astrochemical rate-equation models to reproduce
accurately the effects of back-diffusion on grain-surface reaction rates.
Back-diffusion reduces reaction rates by a maximum factor of around 5 for the
canonical grain of $\sim$10$^6$ surface sites, but this falls to unity at close
to full surface coverage.

every variable appears only once in covering constraints. We then design a
generic integral algorithm for solving this restricted family of IPs. We
demonstrate a new technique for solving mixed packing/covering integer

means of first-principles DFT calculations. It is suggested that for electron
doping levels $x$ (number of electrons per unit cell) $\sim$ 0.18-0.30$e^-$ the
system could exhibit incommensurate charge or spin modulations which, however,
would keep the metallic state whereas systems doped with smaller $x$ would be

cathode, a molten salt separation layer, and a liquid metal anode at the top.
Convection is triggered by the temperature gradient between the hot electrolyte
and the colder electrodes, which is a consequence of the release of resistive
heat during operation. We present a linear stability analysis of the state of
pure thermal conduction in combination with three-dimensional direct numerical
simulations of the nonlinear turbulent evolution on the basis of a
pseudospectral method. Five different modes of convection are identified in the
configuration, which are partly coupled to each other: RC in the upper
electrode, RC with internal heating in the molten salt layer, MC at both
interfaces between molten salt and electrode as well as anti-convectionin the
middle layer and lower electrode. The linear stability analysis confirms that
the additional Marangoni effect in the present setup increases the growth rates
of the linearly unstable modes, i.e. Marangoni and Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
instability act together in the molten salt layer. The critical Grashof and
Marangoni numbers decrease with increasing middle layer thickness. The
calculated thresholds for the onset of convection are found for realistic
current densities of laboratory-sized LMBs. The global turbulent heat transfer
follows scaling predictions for internally heated RC. The global turbulent
momentum transfer is comparable with turbulent convection in the classical
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard case.

organization of complex systems like the brain. A principal appeal of these
techniques is their ability to identify a partition of brain regions (or nodes)
into communities, where nodes within a community are densely interconnected. In
their simplest application, community detection algorithms are agnostic to the
presence of community hierarchies, but a common characteristic of many neural
systems is a nested hierarchy. To address this limitation, we exercise a
multi-scale extension of a community detection technique known as modularity
maximization, and we apply the tool to both synthetic graphs and graphs derived
from human structural and functional imaging data. Our multi-scale community
detection algorithm links a graph to copies of itself across neighboring
topological scales, thereby becoming sensitive to conserved community
organization across neighboring levels of the hierarchy. We demonstrate that
this method allows for a better characterization of topological inhomogeneities
of the graph's hierarchy by providing a local (node) measure of community
stability and inter-scale reliability across topological scales. We compare the
brain's structural and functional network architectures and demonstrate that
structural graphs display a wider range of topological scales than functional
graphs. Finally, we build a multimodal multiplex graph that combines structural
and functional connectivity in a single model, and we identify the topological
scales where resting state functional connectivity and underlying structural
connectivity show similar versus unique hierarchical community architecture.
Together, our results showcase the advantages of the multi-scale community
detection algorithm in studying hierarchical community structure in brain
graphs, and they illustrate its utility in modeling multimodal neuroimaging

parallel planes, its morphology will change accordingly to either varying the
volume of the droplet or the separation (characterized by h) between the
planes. We are aiming at investigating how such a geometric confinement affects
the wetting behaviours of a droplet. Our focus lies on two distinguished
regimes: (1) a pancake shape in a Hele-Shaw cell when the droplet is highly
compressed (i.e. h/R << 1), in which particular attention is paid on nonwetting
and wetting cases, respectively; and (2) a liquid Hertzian contact rendered by
a slight confinement (i.e. h/(2R) --> 1) in a nonwetting case. To realize this
aim, we first develop strict analytical expressions of the shape of the droplet
which are available for arbitrary contact angles between the liquid and the
solid planes, but in which the elliptic integrals indicate that these solutions
are implicit. By employing asymptotic methods, we are able to give expressions
of relevant geometrical and physical parameters (the Laplace pressure, droplet
volume, surface energy and external force) in terms of sole functions of R and
h in an explicit manner. Comparisons suggest that over a large range of h/R,
our asymptotic results quantitatively agree well with the numerical solutions

information theory to address the problem of entanglement wedge reconstruction
in AdS/CFT. It has recently been proposed that any low-energy local bulk
operators in a CFT boundary region's entanglement wedge can be reconstructed on
that boundary region itself. Existing work arguing for this proposal relies on
algebraic consequences of the exact equivalence between bulk and boundary
relative entropies, namely the theory of operator algebra quantum error
correction. However, bulk and boundary relative entropies are only
approximately equal in bulk effective field theory, and in similar situations
it is known that predictions from exact entropic equalities can be
qualitatively incorrect. The framework of universal recovery channels provides
a robust demonstration of the entanglement wedge reconstruction conjecture in
addition to new physical insights. Most notably, we find that a bulk operator
acting in a given boundary region's entanglement wedge can be expressed as the
response of the boundary region's modular Hamiltonian to a perturbation of the
bulk state in the direction of the bulk operator. This formula can be
interpreted as a noncommutative version of Bayes' rule that attempts to undo
the noise induced by restricting to only a portion of the boundary, and has an
integral representation in terms of modular flows. To reach these conclusions,
we extend the theory of universal recovery channels to finite-dimensional
operator algebras and demonstrate that recovery channels approximately preserve
the multiplicative structure of the operator algebra.

end, various metrics of predictive accuracy are commonly used, such as the Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), or precision and recall. All these metrics more or

  Unfortunately, human behaviour is always associated with some degree of
uncertainty, making the evaluation difficult, since it is not clear whether a

human decision making. At this point, some authors speculated that we may be
reaching some Magic Barrier where this variability prevents us from getting
much more accurate.
  In this article, we will extend the existing theory of the Magic Barrier into
a new probabilistic but a yet pragmatic model. In particular, we will use
methods from metrology and physics to develop easy-to-handle quantities for

amplification of initially weak seed fields, reaching equipartition strength
inside the interstellar medium. The small-scale dynamo appears to be a viable
mechanism to explain observations of strong magnetic fields in present-day and
high-redshift galaxies, considering the extreme weakness of seed fields
predicted by battery mechanisms or primordial fields. Performing
high-resolution adaptive mesh magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a small mass,
isolated cooling halo with an initial magnetic seed field strength well below
equipartition, we follow the small-scale dynamo amplification from
supernova-induced turbulence up to saturation of the field. We find that
saturation occurs when the average magnetic pressure reaches only 3 % to 5 % of
the turbulent pressure. The magnetic energy growth transitions from exponential
to linear, and finally comes to halt. The saturation level increases slightly
with grid resolution. These results are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions for magnetic Prandtl numbers of order $\mathrm{Pr_M} \sim 1$ and
turbulent Mach numbers of order $\mathrm{M} \sim 10$. When we suppress
supernova feedback after our simulation has reached saturation, we find that
turbulence decays and that the gas falls back onto a thin disk with the
magnetic field in local equipartition.
  We propose a scenario in which galactic magnetic fields are amplified from
weak seed fields in the early stages of the Universe to sub-equipartition
fields, owing to the turbulent environment of feedback-dominated galaxies at
high redshift, and are evolved further in a later stage up to equipartition, as
galaxies transformed into more quiescent, large spiral disks.

tensions in $b \to s \mu \mu$, where the model can significantly reduce the
discrepancies in angular observables, branching ratios and the
lepton-flavor-universality observables $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. The leptoquark can
also reconcile the predicted and measured value of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon and appears naturally in models of radiative neutrino mass
derived from lepton-number violating effective operators. As a representative
example, we incorporate the particle into an existing two-loop neutrino mass
scenario derived from a dimension-nine operator. In this specific model, the
structure of the neutrino mass matrix provides enough freedom to explain the
small masses of the neutrinos in the region of parameter space dictated by
agreement with the anomalies in $\bar{B}\rightarrow D^{(*)}\tau \bar{\nu}$, but
not the $b \to s$ transition. This is achieved without excessive fine-tuning in
the parameters important for neutrino mass.

processes occurring near a super-massive black hole (SMBH). Here we investigate
the role of supernova (SN) explosions occurring in massive binary systems lying
in a disc-like structure within the innermost parsec. We use a regularized
algorithm to simulate 30,000 isolated three-body systems composed of a stellar
binary orbiting the SMBH. We start the integration when the primary member
undergoes a SN explosion, and we analyze the impact of SN kicks on the orbits
of stars and compact remnants. We find that SN explosions scatter the lighter
stars in the pair on completely different orbits, with higher eccentricity and
inclination. In contrast, stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and massive stars
retain memory of the orbit of their progenitor star. Our results suggest that
SN kicks are not sufficient to eject BHs from the GC. We thus predict that all
BHs that form in situ in the central parsec of our Galaxy remain in the GC,
building up a cluster of dark remnants. In addition, the change of NS orbits
induced by SNe may partially account for the observed dearth of NSs in the GC.
About 40 per cent of remnants stay bound to the stellar companion after the
kick; we expect up to 70 per cent of them might become X-ray binaries through
Roche-lobe filling. Finally, the eccentricity of some light stars becomes > 0.7
as an effect of the SN kick, producing orbits similar to those of the G1 and G2
dusty objects.

the case of a neutron star binary inspiral, we model the associated short

possible lightcurves is the basis to construct the detectability map. As a
practical example, we apply the method to a simulated GW signal produced by a
neutron star merger at 75 Mpc whose localization uncertainty is very large
(about 1500 square degrees). We construct observing strategies based on the
detectability maps for optical, infrared and radio facilities, taking VST,
VISTA and MeerKAT as prototypes. Assuming limiting fluxes of r ~ 24.5, J ~ 22.4

N V 1240 in the composite spectrum, which clearly separate them from typical

have intriguingly been suggested by some quantum-gravity models as alternatives
to classical black-hole spacetimes. A remarkable feature of spinning
horizonless compact objects with reflective boundary conditions is the
existence of a {\it discrete} set of critical surface radii,
$\{r_{\text{c}}({\bar a};n)\}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$, which can support spatially
regular static ({\it marginally-stable}) scalar field configurations (here
${\bar a}\equiv J/M^2$ is the dimensionless angular momentum of the exotic
compact object). Interestingly, the outermost critical radius
$r^{\text{max}}_{\text{c}}\equiv \text{max}_n\{r_{\text{c}}({\bar a};n)\}$
marks the boundary between stable and unstable exotic compact objects: spinning
objects whose reflecting surfaces are situated in the region
$r_{\text{c}}>r^{\text{max}}_{\text{c}}({\bar a})$ are stable, whereas spinning
objects whose reflecting surfaces are situated in the region
$r_{\text{c}}<r^{\text{max}}_{\text{c}}({\bar a})$ are superradiantly unstable
to scalar perturbation modes. In the present paper we use analytical techniques
in order to explore the physical properties of the critical (marginally-stable)
spinning exotic compact objects. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact
{\it analytical} formula for the discrete spectrum
$\{r^{\text{max}}_{\text{c}}({\bar a})\}$ of critical radii which characterize
the marginally-stable exotic compact objects. We explicitly demonstrate that
the analytically derived resonance spectrum agrees remarkably well with

in an environment where each site initially contains one unit of food. Upon
encountering a food-containing site, the forager eats all the food there and
can subsequently hop an additional $\mathcal{S}$ steps without food before
starving to death. Upon encountering an empty site, the forager goes hungry and
comes one time unit closer to starvation. We investigate the new feature of
forager greed; if the forager has a choice between hopping to an empty site or
to a food-containing site in its nearest neighborhood, it hops preferentially
towards food. If the neighboring sites all contain food or are all empty, the
forager hops equiprobably to one of these neighbors. Paradoxically, the
lifetime of the forager can depend non-monotonically on greed, and the sense of
the non-monotonicity is opposite in one and two dimensions. Even more
unexpectedly, the forager lifetime in one dimension is substantially enhanced
when the greed is negative; here the forager tends to avoid food in its local
neighborhood. We also determine the average amount of food consumed at the
instant when the forager starves. We present analytic, heuristic, and numerical
results to elucidate these intriguing phenomena.

the North. We detected and assigned 18 emission lines of the H$_{3}^{+}$,
2$\nu_{2}\rightarrow 0$ overtone band in the region from 4800 to 4980 cm$^{-1}$
and 5 additional lines in the extended low-resolution spectrum. We use our new
modelling scheme, ATMOF to remove telluric absorption bands of CO$_2$ that
feature strongly in the 2 $\mu$m region. The H${_2}$ 1-0 S(1), S(2) and S(3)
emission lines are also detected in the observed spectral region. We found the
rotational temperature and column density of H$_{3}^{+}$ emission at the peak
intensity for both northern and southern auroral regions to be the same within
the measurement errors (T$_{rot} \sim950$K and N(H$_{3}^{+}$) $\sim$
4.5$\times10^{16}$m$^{-2}$). The estimates of T$_{rot}$ from H$_{2}$ are
consistent within much higher uncertainties with temperatures derived from
H$_{3}^{+}$ emissions. We derived the profiles of the H$_{3}^{+}$ emissivity
and ion density for both auroral regions providing the first such measurement
for the emission associated with the main spot of the Io footprint. We also
found a number of weaker lines in the high-resolution spectra that could be
associated with emission from high excitation levels in neutral iron, which
could be deposited in Jupiter's atmosphere as a result of meteor ablation.

Inverse Compton emission. The deepest limits rule out the weakest uncollimated
GRB outflows, suggesting that IF the similarity of SLSNe-I with GRB/SNe extends
to their fastest ejecta, then SLSNe-I are either powered by energetic jets
pointed far away from our line of sight theta>30 deg, or harbor failed jets
that do not successfully break through the stellar envelope. Furthermore, IF a
magnetar central engine is responsible for the exceptional luminosity of
SLSNe-I, our X-ray analysis favors large magnetic fields B>2x10^(14) G and
ejecta masses M_ej>3 Msun in agreement with optical/UV studies. Finally, we
constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of stellar progenitors of SLSNe-I.

For the gravitational wave power spectrum, we find that the predicted $k^{-3}$
behaviour, where $k$ is the wavenumber, emerges clearly for detonations. The
power spectra from deflagrations show similar features, but exhibit a steeper
high-$k$ decay and an extra feature not accounted for in the model. There are
two independent length scales: the mean bubble separation and the thickness of
the sound shell around the expanding bubble of the low temperature phase. It is
the sound shell thickness which sets the position of the peak of the power
spectrum. The low wavenumber behaviour of the velocity power spectrum is
consistent with a causal $k^{3}$, except for the thinnest sound shell, where it
is steeper. We present parameters for a simple broken power law fit to the
gravitational wave power spectrum for wall speeds well away from the speed of
sound where this form can be usefully applied. We examine the prospects for the
detection, showing that a LISA-like mission has the sensitivity to detect a
gravitational wave signal from sound waves with an RMS fluid velocity of about
$0.05c$, produced from bubbles with a mean separation of about $10^{-2}$ of the
Hubble radius. The shape of the gravitational wave power spectrum depends on
the bubble wall speed, and it may be possible to estimate the wall speed, and

detectability of H$_2$O absorption features in transmission spectra depends on
the abundance of water vapor in the upper part of the atmosphere. We study the
three-dimensional distribution of atmospheric H$_2$O for synchronously rotating
Earth-sized aquaplanets using the general circulation model (GCM) ROCKE-3D, and
examine the effects of total incident flux and stellar spectral type. We
observe a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to
increased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest, in qualitative
agreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar
point previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets.
However, the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to
increase while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by
the circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating
due to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles, causing efficient
vertical transport of water vapor. Consistently, the water vapor mixing ratio
is found to be well-correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident
flux. We also simulate transmission spectra based on the GCM outputs, and show
that for the more highly irradiated planets, the H$_2$O signatures may be
strengthened by a factor of a few, loosening the observational demands for a

Numerous trans-Neptunian objects are known to be in mean-motion
resonance with Neptune. We aim to describe their long-term orbital evolution
(both past and future) by means of a one-degree-of-freedom secular model. In
this paper, we focus only on objects with a semi-major axis larger than 50
astronomical units (au).
  Methods. For each resonant object considered, a 500 000-year numerical
integration is performed. The output is digitally filtered to get the
parameters of the resonant secular model. Their long-term (Giga-year) orbital
evolution is then represented by the level curves of the secular Hamiltonian.
  Results. For the majority of objects considered, the mean-motion resonance
has little impact on the long-term trajectories (the secular dynamics is
similar to a non-resonant one). However, a subset of objects is strongly
affected by the resonance, producing moderately-high-amplitude oscillations of
the perihelion distance and/or libration of the argument of perihelion around a
fixed centre. Moreover, the high perihelion distance of the object 2015 FJ345
is plainly explained by long-term resonant dynamics, allowing us to also deduce
its orbital elements at the time of capture in resonance (at least 15 million
years ago). The same type of past evolution is expected for 2014 FZ71.

a similar index for both BL Lacs and flat-spectrum radio quasars. We show that
this variability can be produced by turbulence in relativistic jets launched by
magnetically arrested accretion flows (MADs). We perform radiative transport
calculations on the turbulent, highly-magnetized jet launching region of a MAD
with a rapidly rotating supermassive black hole. The resulting synchrotron and
synchrotron self-Compton emission, originating from close to the black hole
horizon, is highly variable. This variability is characterized by PDS which is
remarkably similar to the observed power-law spectrum at frequencies less than
a few per day. Furthermore, turbulence in the jet launching region naturally
produces fluctuations in the plasma on scales much smaller than the horizon
radius. We speculate that similar turbulent processes, operating in the jet at
large radii (and therefore high bulk Lorentz factor), are responsible for
blazar variability over many decades in frequency, including on minute
timescales.

between the non-relativistic limit and the highly relativistic chiral limit,
where the pseudoscalar mass drops to zero. The fermion mass becomes purely
dynamical at this point. When the gauge coupling is constant over a moderate
range of scales the scalar becomes significantly lighter than the spin 1 states

The optimized spherical core-shell nanoresonator containing a centralized

Decentralization of the emitter leads to appearance of higher order multipolar

The simultaneous enhancements result in 6.2x10^5 Px factor with 50.6% cQE at

transversal and longitudinal dipolar resonances, moreover they enhance the
fluorescence more significantly due to their antenna-like geometry. Px factor

Specifically, if one measure the velocity of red blood cells by means of laser
speckle imaging, then visual measurements become impossible, while the
velocity-based estimation has their own limitations. One of promising
approaches is based on fast switching of illumination type, but it drastically

that this probability should be maximized by the disk.
  We first prove that the disk is a weak local maximum for planar regions and
that the ball is a weak local maximum in three dimensional regions. We then
prove a local $C^{2,1/2}$-type estimate on the probability in the Hausdorff
topology. This enables us to prove that the disk is a local maximum in the
Gromov-Hausdorff topology (modulo congruences). Finally, we give an explicit
upper bound on the isoperimetric ratio of the regions which maximize the

finite, though currently intractable, calculation.
  An interesting aspect of our work is the use of tools from outside of
geometric probability. We use an autocorrelation integral to provide the
appropriate framework for the problem. When we study the problem in
$\mathbb{R}^3$, we need non-Abelian harmonic analysis. To set up the proof that
the disk is a strong local maximum, we use the Borsak-Ulam theorem.

such properties is the 2D dissipative quantum XY model. Exact relations between
the density correlations and singular irreducible vertices due to coupling of
Fermions to the topological excitations of the 2D dissipative quantum XY model

are measurable only recently due to advances in experimental techniques. The
density correlations are unusual at all momenta ${\bf q}$ and energy $\nu$,
from the hydrodynamic limit to that for large momenta and energy. The
hydrodynamic limit together with the continuity equation gives the linear in T
resistivity. The density correlations are almost independent of frequency up to
a high frequency cut-off for $q_{ZB} \gtrsim q >> \nu/v_F$; $q_{ZB}$ is the
Brillouin zone boundary and $v_F$ is the Fermi-velocity. The results should be

these effects are reflected in the overall decline the rotation curve as the
cluster evolves and loses stars.
  We show that all of our models share the same dependence of the remaining
fraction of the initial rotation on the fraction of the initial mass lost. As
the cluster evolves and loses part of its initial angular momentum, it becomes
increasingly dominated by random motions, but even after several tens of
relaxation times, and losing a significant fraction of its initial mass, a
cluster can still be characterized by a non-negligible ratio of the rotational
velocity to the velocity dispersion. This result is in qualitative agreement
with the recently observed kinematical complexity which characterizes several

traditional approaches based on the partial diagonalization of the propagator
often encounter oscillatory and stagnating convergence. Electronic structure
methods which solve the molecular response problem through the solution of
spectrally shifted linear systems, such as the complex polarization propagator,
offer an alternative approach which is agnostic to the underlying spectral
density or domain location. This generality comes at a seemingly high
computational cost associated with solving a large linear system for each
spectral shift in some discretization of the spectral domain of interest. We
present a novel, adaptive solution based on model order reduction techniques

of mathematical models and is ubiquitous in the simulation of dynamical
systems. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the ab

the oxygen K-edge. Based on a single, user defined tolerance we automatically
determine the order of the reduced models and approximate the absorption
spectrum up to the given tolerance. We also illustrate that the automatically
determined model order increases logarithmically with the problem dimension,

window. Furthermore, we observed that the computational cost of the proposed

bifurcation between outbursting (""limit cycle"") and non-outbursting

mass-injection rate instigate transitions between the two regimes. In this
paper we explore an alternative trigger for these transitions: stochastic
fluctuations in the disk's turbulent viscosity. We employ simple one-zone and
global viscous models which, though inappropriate for detailed matching to
observed light curves, clearly indicate that turbulent disk fluctuations induce
outbursts when the system is sufficiently close to the global bifurcation
point. While the models easily produce the observed ""outburst dip"" pairs
exhibited by Z Cam and Nova-like variables, they struggle to generate long
trains of outbursts. We conclude that mass transfer variability is the dominant
physical process determining the overall Z Cam standstill outburst pattern, but
that viscous stochasticity provides an additional ingredient explaining some of
the secondary features observed.

component in the context of galaxy evolution, since they put constraints on the
age of the star formation bursts. Nearby galaxies (d<5 Mpc) are particularly
relevant in this context since they fill the gap between studies in the Local
Group, where individual stars can be resolved, and galaxies in the Local Volume
and beyond. We intend to characterize the W-R star population in NGC625, a
low-metallicity dwarf galaxy suffering a currently declining burst of star
formation. Optical IFS data have been obtained with the VIMOS-IFU covering the
starburst region. We estimate the number of W-R stars using a linear
combination of 3 W-R templates: 1 early-type nitrogen (WN) star, 1 late-type WN
star and 1 carbon-type (WC) star (or oxygen-type (WO) star). Fits using several
ensembles of templates were tested. Results were confronted with: i) high
spatial resolution HST photometry; ii) numbers of W-R stars in nearby galaxies;
iii) model predictions. The W-R star population is spread over the main body of
the galaxy, not necessarily coincident with the overall stellar distribution.
Our best estimation for the number of W-R stars yields a total of 28 W-R stars
in the galaxy, out of which 17 are early- type WN, 6 are late-type WN and 5 are
WC stars. The width of the stellar features nicely correlates with the dominant
W-R type found in each aperture. The distribution of the different types of WR
in the galaxy is roughly compatible with the way star formation has propagated
in the galaxy, according to previous findings using HST images. Fits using
templates at the metallicity of the LMC yield more reasonable number of W-R
than those using templates at the metallicity of the SMC. Given the metallicity
of NGC 625, this suggests a non-linear relation between the metallicity and the
luminosity of the W-R spectral features.

line-of-sight velocity is derived using the apparent optical depth method. The
ISM is found to be sufficiently clumpy, supporting the direct escape of LyC
photons. We further report on broadband UV and optical continuum imaging as
well as narrowband imaging of Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Using stellar
population synthesis, a Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of 8% was derived. We also
performed VLA 21cm imaging. The hydrogen hyperfine transition was not detected,
but a deep upper limit atomic gas mass of $\lesssim10^9 M_{\odot}$ could be
derived. The upper limit gas fraction defined as $\frac{M_{H I}}{M_*}$ is only
20%. Evidence is found that the H I gas halo is relatively small compared to

We use two
different approaches, one that relates an $F(R)$ gravity to well known scalar

known techniques, we find the $F(R)$ gravity which realizes a given
constant-roll evolution in the scalar-tensor theory. We also perform a
conformal transformation in the resulting $F(R)$ gravity and we find the
Einstein frame counterpart theory. As we demonstrate, the resulting scalar
potential is different in comparison to the original scalar constant-roll case,
and the same applies for the corresponding observational indices. Moreover, we
discuss how cosmological evolutions that can realize constant-roll to
constant-roll eras transitions in the scalar-tensor description, can be
realized by vacuum $F(R)$ gravity. With regards to the second approach, we
examine directly the effects of the constant-roll condition on the inflationary
dynamics of vacuum $F(R)$ gravity. We present in detail the formalism of
constant-roll $F(R)$ gravity inflationary dynamics and we discuss how the
inflationary indices become in this case. We use two well known $F(R)$

$F(R)$ gravity in vacuum. As we demonstrate, in both cases the parameter space

detection. Manually labeling the samples into benign or different malicious
families requires tremendous human efforts, while it is comparably easy and
cheap to obtain a large amount of unlabeled APKs from various sources.
Moreover, the fast-paced evolution of Android malware continuously generates
derivative malware families. These families often contain new signatures, which
can escape detection when using static analysis. These practical challenges can
also cause traditional supervised machine learning algorithms to degrade in
performance.
  In this paper, we propose a framework that uses model-based semi-supervised
(MBSS) classification scheme on the dynamic Android API call logs. The
semi-supervised approach efficiently uses the labeled and unlabeled APKs to
estimate a finite mixture model of Gaussian distributions via conditional
expectation-maximization and efficiently detects malwares during out-of-sample
testing. We compare MBSS with the popular malware detection classifiers such as
support vector machine (SVM), $k$-nearest neighbor (kNN) and linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). Under the ideal classification setting, MBSS has
competitive performance with 98\% accuracy and very low false positive rate for
in-sample classification. For out-of-sample testing, the out-of-sample test
data exhibit similar behavior of retrieving phone information and sending to
the network, compared with in-sample training set. When this similarity is
strong, MBSS and SVM with linear kernel maintain 90\% detection rate while
$k$NN and LDA suffer great performance degradation. When this similarity is
slightly weaker, all classifiers degrade in performance, but MBSS still
performs significantly better than other classifiers.

due to, among other important features, its ability to provide high-resolution,
day-and-night and almost weather-independent images. SAR images are affected
from a granular contamination, speckle, that can be described by a
multiplicative model. Many despeckling techniques have been proposed in the
literature, as well as measures of the quality of the results they provide.
Assuming the multiplicative model, the observed image $Z$ is the product of two
independent fields: the backscatter $X$ and the speckle $Y$. The result of any
speckle filter is $\widehat X$, an estimator of the backscatter $X$, based
solely on the observed data $Z$. An ideal estimator would be the one for which
the ratio of the observed image to the filtered one $I=Z/\widehat X$ is only
speckle: a collection of independent identically distributed samples from Gamma
variates. We, then, assess the quality of a filter by the closeness of $I$ to
the hypothesis that it is adherent to the statistical properties of pure
speckle. We analyze filters through the ratio image they produce with regards
to first- and second-order statistics: the former check marginal properties,
while the latter verifies lack of structure. A new quantitative image-quality
index is then defined, and applied to state-of-the-art despeckling filters.
This new measure provides consistent results with commonly used quality
measures (equivalent number of looks, PSNR, MSSIM, $\beta$ edge correlation,
and preservation of the mean), and ranks the filters results also in agreement
with their visual analysis. We conclude our study showing that the proposed
measure can be successfully used to optimize the (often many) parameters that
define a speckle filter.

challenge in maximizing the successful transmission capacity of the overall

carrier sensing threshold of the contention based medium access protocol and
the choice of packet forwarding strategy selected at each hop by the devices.
The fundamental problem in optimizing the performance of such networks is to
balance the tradeoff between conflicting performance objectives such as the
spatial frequency reuse, transmission quality, and packet progress towards the
destination. In this paper, we use a stochastic geometry approach to quantify
the performance of multi-hop massive IoT networks in terms of the spatial
frequency reuse and the transmission quality under different packet forwarding
schemes. We also develop a comprehensive performance metric that can be used to
optimize the system to achieve the best performance. The results can be used to
select the best forwarding scheme and tune the carrier sensing threshold to
optimize the performance of the network according to the delay constraints and
transmission quality requirements.

intelligence (e.g., the game of Go), is a well-known strategy for constructing
approximate solutions to sequential decision problems. Its primary innovation
is the use of a heuristic, known as a default policy, to obtain Monte Carlo
estimates of downstream values for states in a decision tree. This information
is used to iteratively expand the tree towards regions of states and actions
that an optimal policy might visit. However, to guarantee convergence to the
optimal action, MCTS requires the entire tree to be expanded asymptotically. In
this paper, we propose a new technique called Primal-Dual MCTS that utilizes
sampled information relaxation upper bounds on potential actions, creating the
possibility of ""ignoring"" parts of the tree that stem from highly suboptimal
choices. This allows us to prove that despite converging to a partial decision
tree in the limit, the recommended action from Primal-Dual MCTS is optimal. The
new approach shows significant promise when used to optimize the behavior of a
single driver navigating a graph while operating on a ride-sharing platform.
Numerical experiments on a real dataset of 7,000 trips in New Jersey suggest

dissemination has made it an ideal platform for spreading rumors. Automatically
debunking rumors at their stage of diffusion is known as \textit{early rumor
detection}, which refers to dealing with sequential posts regarding disputed
factual claims with certain variations and highly textual duplication over
time. Thus, identifying trending rumors demands an efficient yet flexible model
that is able to capture long-range dependencies among postings and produce
distinct representations for the accurate early detection. However, it is a
challenging task to apply conventional classification algorithms to rumor
detection in earliness since they rely on hand-crafted features which require
intensive manual efforts in the case of large amount of posts. This paper
presents a deep attention model on the basis of recurrent neural networks (RNN)
to learn \textit{selectively} temporal hidden representations of sequential
posts for identifying rumors. The proposed model delves soft-attention into the
recurrence to simultaneously pool out distinct features with particular focus
and produce hidden representations that capture contextual variations of
relevant posts over time. Extensive experiments on real datasets collected from
social media websites demonstrate that (1) the deep attention based RNN model
outperforms state-of-the-arts that rely on hand-crafted features; (2) the
introduction of soft attention mechanism can effectively distill relevant parts
to rumors from original posts in advance; (3) the proposed method detects
rumors more quickly and accurately than competitors.

topology, the baryon topology and the monopole topology. We provide more

be decomposed to the monopole number $m$ and the shell number $n$, so that $B$
is given by $B=mn$. This tells that the skyrmions may more conveniently be
classified by two integers $(m,n)$. This is because the rational map which
determines the baryon number in the popular multi-skyrmion solutions actually
describes the monopole topology $\pi_2(S^2)$ which is different from the baryon
topology $\pi_3(S^3)$. Moreover, we show that the baby skyrmions can also be
generalized to have two topology, $\pi_1(S^1)$ and $\pi_2(S^2)$, and thus
should be classified by two topological numbers $(m,n)$. Furthermore, we show
that the vacuum of the Skyrme theory can be classified by two topological
numbers $(p,q)$, the $\pi_1(S^1)$ of the sigma-field and the $\pi_3(S^2)$ of

treated in the context of Finsler geometry (FG) modeling, where triangle edge
length in $M$ depends on the direction. It is also shown that the discrete FG

significant (10.7$\sigma$) spatial overdensity of star-like objects, which are
selected from a relevant isochrone filter designed for a metal-poor and old
stellar population. This stellar system is located at a heliocentric distance

25.1 (UDeep, 2.9 deg$^2$) and 24.6--24.8 (Deep, 13.3 deg$^2$) mag in NB921. The
wide-field imaging allows us to construct unprecedentedly large samples of
8,054 H$\alpha$ emitters at z ~ 0.25 and 0.40, 8,656 [OIII] emitters at z ~
0.63 and 0.84, and 16,877 [OII] emitters at z ~ 1.19 and 1.47. We map the
cosmic web on scales out to about 50 comoving Mpc that includes galaxy
clusters, identified by red sequence galaxies, located at the intersection of
filamentary structures of star-forming galaxies. The luminosity functions of
emission-line galaxies are measured with precision and consistent with
published studies. The wide field coverage of the data enables us to measure
the luminosity functions up to brighter luminosities than previous studies. The
comparison of the luminosity functions between the different HSC-SSP fields
suggests that a survey volume of $>5\times10^5$ Mpc$^3$ is essential to
overcome cosmic variance. Since the current data have not reached the full
depth expected for the HSC-SSP, the color cut in i-NB816 or z-NB921 induces a
bias towards star-forming galaxies with large equivalent widths, primarily seen
in the stellar mass functions for the H$\alpha$ emitters at z ~ 0.25--0.40.
Even so, the emission-line galaxies clearly cover a wide range of luminosity,
stellar mass, and environment, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the NB data

This guarantees the existence of a finite chemical potential and a critical

geolocation, rate items, or consume media. A common problem is to predict what
a user might do next for the purposes of guidance, recommendation, or
prefetching. First-order and higher-order Markov chains have been widely used
methods to study such sequences of data. First-order Markov chains are easy to
estimate, but lack accuracy when history matters. Higher-order Markov chains,
in contrast, have too many parameters and suffer from overfitting the training
data. Fitting these parameters with regularization and smoothing only offers
mild improvements. In this paper we propose the retrospective higher-order
Markov process (RHOMP) as a low-parameter model for such sequences. This model
is a special case of a higher-order Markov chain where the transitions depend
retrospectively on a single history state instead of an arbitrary combination
of history states. There are two immediate computational advantages: the number
of parameters is linear in the order of the Markov chain and the model can be
fit to large state spaces. Furthermore, by providing a specific structure to
the higher-order chain, RHOMPs improve the model accuracy by efficiently
utilizing history states without risks of overfitting the data. We demonstrate
how to estimate a RHOMP from data and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on various real application datasets spanning geolocation data, review
sequences, and business locations. The RHOMP model uniformly outperforms
higher-order Markov chains, Kneser-Ney regularization, and tensor
factorizations in terms of prediction accuracy.

testing problem, in which one attempts to detect an anomalous directed path in

the signal hypothesis, one observes independent Gaussian variables of unit
variance at all nodes, with zero, mean off the anomalous path and mean \mu_n on
it. Under the null hypothesis, one observes i.i.d. standard Gaussians on all

under the signal hypothesis has known the initial location, then detection is
possible (in the minimax sense) if \mu_n >> 1/\sqrt log n, while it is not
possible if \mu_n << 1/ log n\sqrt log log n. In this paper, we show that this
result continues to hold even when the initial location of the unknown path is

also applies when the path is undirected. The improvement is achieved by
replacing the linear detection statistic used in Arias-Castro et al. (2008)
with a polynomial statistic, which is obtained by employing a multi-scale
analysis on a quadratic statistic to bootstrap its performance. Our analysis is
motivated by ideas developed in the context of the analysis of random polymers

small number of subspaces from the collection have non-trivial intersection
with $W$; more precisely, the sum of dimensions of $W \cap H_i$ is at most some

applications to list decoding variants of Reed-Solomon and algebraic-geometric
codes, and later also used for explicit rank-metric codes with optimal list
decoding radius.
  Guruswami and Kopparty (FOCS'13, Combinatorica'16) gave an explicit
construction of subspace designs with near-optimal parameters. This
construction was based on polynomials and has close connections to folded
Reed-Solomon codes, and required large field size (specifically $q \ge m$).
Forbes and Guruswami (RANDOM'15) used this construction to give explicit
constant degree ""dimension expanders"" over large fields, and noted that
subspace designs are a powerful tool in linear-algebraic pseudorandomness.
  Here, we construct subspace designs over any field, at the expense of a
modest worsening of the bound $L$ on total intersection dimension. Our approach
is based on a (non-trivial) extension of the polynomial-based construction to
algebraic function fields, and instantiating the approach with cyclotomic
function fields. Plugging in our new subspace designs in the construction of
Forbes and Guruswami yields dimension expanders over $\F^n$ for any field $\F$,

a flat faint-end slope with a power-law index of -1.30+-0.05. The knee and

The flat slope implies that the UV luminosity density of the quasar population

$\hbx$ is uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Then, we give a simple

To this end we use the magnetic and velocity fields in a horizontal layer near
the top boundary of the solar convective dynamo simulation to drive realistic
radiative-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the upper most layers of the
convection zone. The main results are: (1) The emerging flux bundles rise with
the mean speed of convective upflows, and fragment into small-scale magnetic
elements that further rise to the photosphere, where bipolar sunspot pairs are
formed through the coalescence of the small-scale magnetic elements. (2)
Filamentary penumbral structures form when the sunspot is still growing through
ongoing flux emergence. In contrast to the classical Evershed effect, the
inflow seems to prevail over the outflow in a large part of the penumbra. (3) A
well formed sunspot is a mostly monolithic magnetic structures that is anchored
in a persistent deep-seated downdraft lane. The flow field outside the spot
shows a giant vortex ring that comprises of an inflow below 15 Mm depth and an
outflow above 15 Mm depth. (4) The sunspots successfully reproduce the
fundamental properties of the observed solar active regions, including the more
coherent leading spots with a stronger field strength, and the correct tilts of
bipolar sunspot pairs. These asymmetries can be linked to the intrinsic
asymmetries in the magnetic and flow fields adapted from the convective dynamo
simulation.

considered. The subarrays are assumed to compute locally the sample covariance
matrices of their measurements and communicate them to the processing center. A
sufficient condition for the unique identifiability of the sources in the
aforementioned non-coherent processing scheme is presented. We prove that,
under mild conditions, with the non-coherent system of subarrays, it is
possible to identify more sources than identifiable by each individual
subarray. This property of non-coherent processing has not been investigated
before. We derive the Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLE) for DOA estimation at
the processing center using the sample covariance matrices received from the
subarrays. Moreover, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for our measurement model is
derived and is used to assess the presented DOA estimators. The behaviour of
the CRB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed. In contrast to
coherent processing, we prove that the CRB approaches zero at high SNR only if
at least one subarray can identify the sources individually.

probabilities and collision strengths, and all their possible combinations, to
calculate the physical conditions and the total abundances of O, N, S, Ne, Cl,

data variations introduce differences in the derived abundance ratios as low as
0.1$-$0.2 dex at low density, but that reach or surpass 0.6$-$0.8 dex at
densities above 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ in several abundance ratios, like O/H and
N/O. Removing from the 52 datasets the four datasets that introduce the largest
differences, the total uncertainties are reduced, but high density objects
still reach uncertainty factors of four for their values of O/H and N/O. We
identify the atomic data that introduce most of the uncertainty, which involves
the ions used to determine density, namely, the transition probabilities of the
S$^{+}$, O$^{+}$, Cl$^{++}$, and Ar$^{+3}$ density diagnostic lines, and the
collision strengths of Ar$^{+3}$. Improved calculations of these data will be

grow over time. Preferential attachment and node fitness are two simple growth
mechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly
observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications
in modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating
various parametric forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no
such package implementing non-parametric estimation procedures. The
non-parametric approach to the estimation of the preferential attachment
function allows for comparatively finer-grained investigations of the
`rich-get-richer' phenomenon that could lead to novel insights in the search to
explain certain nonstandard structural properties observed in real-world
networks. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements
non-parametric procedures for estimating the preferential attachment function
and node fitnesses in a growing network, as well as a number of functions for
generating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational
part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability to
large-scale networks. We first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit
through simulated examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration
network between scientists in the field of complex networks. The results
indicate the joint presence of `rich-get-richer' and `fit-get-richer' phenomena
in the collaboration network. The estimated attachment function is observed to
be near-linear, which we interpret as meaning that the chance an author gets a
new collaborator is proportional to their current number of collaborators.
Furthermore, the estimated author fitnesses reveal a host of familiar faces

computer vision applications. Conventionally, an arbitrary threshold is used to
identify a correct match from incorrect matches using Hamming distance which
may improve or degrade the matching results for different input images. This is
mainly due to the image content which is affected by the scene, lighting and
imaging conditions. This paper presents a fuzzy logic based approach for brute
force matching of image features to overcome this situation. The method was
tested using a well-known image database with known ground truth. The approach
is shown to produce a higher number of correct matches when compared against
constant distance thresholds. The nature of fuzzy logic which allows the
vagueness of information and tolerance to errors has been successfully
exploited in an image processing context. The uncertainty arising from the
imaging conditions has been overcome with the use of compact fuzzy matching
membership functions.

  The existence of an ergodic action for the first generator immediately
follows from a powerful theorem of Tucker-Drob, whose proof however uses a

(re-ID) remains a challenging task due to the complex variations in human
appearances from different camera views. For this challenging problem, a large
variety of algorithms have been developed in the fully-supervised setting,
requiring access to a large amount of labeled training data. However, the main
bottleneck for fully-supervised re-ID is the limited availability of labeled
training samples. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a
self-trained subspace learning paradigm for person re-ID which effectively
utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a discriminative subspace
where person images across disjoint camera views can be easily matched. The
proposed approach first constructs pseudo pairwise relationships among
unlabeled persons using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Then, with the
pseudo pairwise relationships, the unlabeled samples can be easily combined
with the labeled samples to learn a discriminative projection by solving an
eigenvalue problem. In addition, we refine the pseudo pairwise relationships
iteratively, which further improves the learning performance. A multi-kernel
embedding strategy is also incorporated into the proposed approach to cope with
the non-linearity in person's appearance and explore the complementation of
multiple kernels. In this way, the performance of person re-ID can be greatly
enhanced when training data are insufficient. Experimental results on six
widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its
performance can be comparable to the reported results of most state-of-the-art
fully-supervised methods while using much fewer labeled data.

learning algorithms in the context of stochastic optimization when gradient
noise is present. These algorithms are used when the risk functions are
non-smooth and involve non-differentiable components. They have been long
recognized as being slow converging methods. However, it was revealed in Part I
that the rate of convergence becomes linear for stochastic optimization
problems, with the error iterate converging at an exponential rate $\alpha^i$
to within an $O(\mu)-$neighborhood of the optimizer, for some $\alpha \in
(0,1)$ and small step-size $\mu$. The conclusion was established under weaker
assumptions than the prior literature and, moreover, several important problems
(such as LASSO, SVM, and Total Variation) were shown to satisfy these weaker

more favorable behavior than originally thought when used to enable continuous
adaptation and learning. The results of Part I were exclusive to single-agent
adaptation. The purpose of the current Part II is to examine the implications
of these discoveries when a collection of networked agents employs subgradient
learning as their cooperative mechanism. The analysis will show that, despite
the coupled dynamics that arises in a networked scenario, the agents are still
able to attain linear convergence in the stochastic case; they are also able to
reach agreement within $O(\mu)$ of the optimizer.

Further, careful attention is paid to the special nature of the superexchange

track the dynamics of orbital and spin ordering. We find that a
high-temperature structural transition results in orbital ordering whose nature
is mixed with respect to the two originally degenerate $e_{g}$ orbitals. This

Jacobian of the displacement field. In particular we are interested in areas of
high strain. The data term of our variational model relies on the brightness
invariance property of the image sequence. As prior we choose the second order
total generalized variation of the displacement field. This prior splits the
Jacobian of the displacement field into a smooth and a non-smooth part. The
latter reflects the material cracks. An additional constraint is incorporated
to handle physical properties of the non-smooth part for tensile tests. We
prove that the resulting convex model has a minimizer and show how a
primal-dual method can be applied to find a minimizer. The corresponding
algorithm has the advantage that the strain tensor is directly computed within
the iteration process. Our algorithm is further equipped with a coarse-to-fine
strategy to cope with larger displacements. Numerical examples with simulated

In comparison to state-of-the-art engineering software for strain analysis our

equilibrium as CPTP maps with an invariant state such that the entropy
production due to the action of the map on the invariant state vanishes.
Thermal maps are a subgroup of CPTP maps with equilibrium. In general, for CPTP
maps, the thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy production or work
performed on the system, depend on the combined state of the system plus its
environment. We show that these quantities can be written in terms of system
properties for maps with equilibrium. The relations that we obtain are valid
for arbitrary coupling strengths between the system and the thermal bath. The
fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are considered in the framework of a
two-point measurement scheme. We derive the entropy production fluctuation
theorem for general maps and a fluctuation relation for the stochastic work on
a system that starts in the Gibbs state. Some simplifications for the
probability distributions in the case of maps with equilibrium are presented.
We illustrate our results by considering spin 1/2 systems under thermal maps,
non-thermal maps with equilibrium, maps with non-equilibrium steady states and
concatenations of them. Finally, we consider a particular limit in which the
concatenation of maps generates a continuous time evolution in Lindblad form
for the system of interest, and we show that the concept of maps with and
without equilibrium translates into Lindblad equations with and without quantum
detailed balance, respectively. The consequences for the thermodynamic
quantities in this limit are discussed.

The nature of the band gap (direct or indirect) for bulk, few and single layer

inter-planar interaction. However, the degree of inter-layer interaction and
the question of whether a transition from indirect to direct gap is observed on
reducing thickness (as in other TMDs) are controversial. We present a direct
determination of the valence band structure of bulk ReS$_2$ using high
resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find a clear
in-plane anisotropy due to the presence of chains of Re atoms, with a strongly
directional effective mass which is larger in the direction orthogonal to the
Re chains (2.2 $m_e$) than along them (1.6 $m_e$), in good agreement with
density functional theory calculations. An appreciable inter-plane interaction
results in an experimentally-measured difference of ~100-200 meV between the
valence band maxima at the Z point (0,0,1/2) and the $\Gamma$ point (0,0,0) of
the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. This leads to a direct gap at Z and a
close-lying but larger gap at $\Gamma$, implying that bulk ReS2 is marginally
indirect. This may account for recent conflicting transport and
photoluminescence measurements and the resulting uncertainty about the direct

than the Hubble time. Theoretical models predict the cooling rate as high as
about few hundred to few thousand solar mass per year, which would be then made
available for the formation of new stars in the core of these clusters.
However, systematic studies of the cores of such clusters failed to detect the
expected reservoirs of cooled gas. Thus, the gas in the cores of galaxy
clusters is losing substantial amount of energy in the form of X-rays but is
not cooling. This in turn point towards the famous cooling flow paradox and
hence demands some intermittent heating to balance the cooling over such a long
period. Several sources have been suggested to counteract on the cooling of the
ICM, however, the AGN feedback appeared to be the most promising and enough
energetic source to resist cooling of the ICM in the cores of such clusters. In
this presentation I will provide a brief overview on the feedback processes
that are involved in the cores of the galaxy clusters with an emphasis on the
AGN feedback and its observable signatures.

find that quasars with higher UV-luminosity or with more massive black holes

optical survey of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP).
Using the first-year survey data covering effectively ~121 deg^2 with the
5sigma depth of i~26.4 and the SDSS DR12Q catalog, we find two luminous pairs
at z~3.3 and 3.6 which reside in >5sigma overdense regions of g-dropout
galaxies at i<25. The projected separations of the two pairs are R_perp=1.75
and 1.04 proper Mpc, and their velocity offsets are Delta V=692 and 1448 km
s^{-1}, respectively. This result is in clear contrast to the average z~4
quasar environments as discussed in Uchiyama et al. (2017) and implies that the
quasar activities of the pair members are triggered via major mergers in
proto-clusters, unlike the vast majority of isolated quasars in general fields
that may turn on via non-merger events such as bar and disk instabilities. At
z~1, we find 37 pairs with R_perp<2 pMpc and Delta V<2300 km s^{-1} in the
current HSC-Wide coverage, including four from Hennawi et al. (2006). The
distribution of the peak overdensity significance within two arcminutes around
the pairs has a long tail toward high density (>4sigma) regions. Thanks to the
large sample size, we find a statistical evidence that this excess is unique to
the pair environments when compared to single quasar and randomly selected
galaxy environments at the same redshift range. Moreover, there are nine
small-scale (R_perp<1 pMpc) pairs, two of which are found to reside in cluster
fields. Our results demonstrate that <2 pMpc-scale quasar pairs at both
redshift range tend to occur in massive haloes, although perhaps not the most
massive ones, and that they are useful to search for rare density peaks.

Radar (PolSAR) data. The novelty of this approach lies in utilizing the
intrinsic information in the off-diagonal elements of the 3$\times$3 coherency
matrix $\mathbf{T}$ represented in the form of complex correlation
coefficients. Two complex correlation coefficients are computed between
co-polarization and cross-polarization components of the Pauli scattering
vector. The difference between modulus of complex correlation coefficients
corresponding to $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{opt}}$ (i.e. the degree of polarization
(DOP) optimized coherency matrix), and $\mathbf{T}$ (original) matrices is
obtained. Then a suitable scaling is performed using fractions \emph{i.e.,}
$(T_{ii}^{\mathrm{opt}}/\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}T_{ii}^{\mathrm{opt}})$ obtained
from the diagonal elements of the $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{opt}}$ matrix.
Thereafter, these new quantities are used in modifying the Yamaguchi
4-component scattering powers obtained from $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{opt}}$. To
corroborate the fact that these quantities have physical relevance, a
quantitative analysis of these for the L-band AIRSAR San Francisco and the
L-band Kyoto images is illustrated. Finally, the scattering powers obtained
from the proposed methodology are compared with the corresponding powers
obtained from the Yamaguchi \emph{et. al.,} 4-component (Y4O) decomposition and
the Yamaguchi \emph{et. al.,} 4-component Rotated (Y4R) decomposition for the

exploit the full potential of existing methodologies. In this note we point out
that message passing algorithms, which are very well developed for inference in
graphical models, appear to be largely unexplored for scalable inference in
Bayesian multilevel regression models. We show that nested multilevel
regression models with Gaussian errors lend themselves very naturally to the
combined use of belief propagation and MCMC. Specifically, the posterior
distribution of the regression parameters conditionally on covariance
hyperparameters is a high-dimensional Gaussian that can be sampled exactly (as
well as marginalized) using belief propagation at a cost that scales linearly
in the number of parameters and data. We derive an algorithm that works
efficiently even for conditionally singular Gaussian distributions, e.g., when
there are linear constraints between the parameters at different levels. We
show that allowing for such non-invertible Gaussians is critical for belief
propagation to be applicable to a large class of nested multilevel models. From
a different perspective, the methodology proposed can be seen as a
generalization of forward-backward algorithms for sampling to multilevel
regressions with tree-structure graphical models, as opposed to single-branch
trees used in classical Kalman filter contexts.

affected by the surrounding medium. An accurate description of these reactions
requires knowing the free energy surface (FES) and the friction felt by the
reactants. Most of theories start from the Langevin equation to derive the
dynamics, but there are few examples comparing it with experiments. Here we
explore the applicability of a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) with an
arbitrary potential and a non-markovian friction. To this end we have performed
broadband fluorescence measurements with sub-picosecond time resolution of a
covalently linked organic electron donor-acceptor system in solvents of
changing viscosity and dielectric permittivity. In order to establish the FES
of the reaction we resort to stationary electronic spectroscopy. On the other
hand, the dynamics of a non-reacting substance, Coumarin 153, provide the
calibrating tool for the friction over the FES, which is assumed to be solute
independent. A simpler and computationally faster approach uses the Generalized
Smoluchowski Equation (GSE), which can be derived from the GLE for pure
harmonic potentials. Both approaches reproduce the measurements in most of the
solvents reasonably well. At long times, some differences arise from the errors
inherited from the analysis of the stationary solvatochromism and at short
times from the excess excitation energy. However, whenever the dynamics become
slow the GSE shows larger deviations than the GLE, the results of which always
agree qualitatively with the measured dynamics, regardless of the solvent
viscosity or dielectric properties. The here applied method can be used to
predict the dynamics of any other reacting system, given the FES parameters and
solvent dynamics are provided. Thus no fitting parameters enter the GLE
simulations, within the applicability limits found for the model in this work.

the field of medical multi-modality imaging such as PET-MRI. Most of the
developed methods rely on the comparison of image gradients, or more precisely
their location, direction and magnitude, to make use of structural similarities
between the images. A challenge and still an open issue for most of the methods
is to handle images in entirely different scales, i.e. different magnitudes of
gradients that cannot be dealt with by a global scaling of the data. We propose
the use of generalized Bregman distances and infimal convolutions thereof with
regard to the well-known total variation functional. The use of a total
variation subgradient respectively the involved vector field rather than an
image gradient naturally excludes the magnitudes of gradients, which in
particular solves the scaling behavior. Additionally, the presented method
features a weighting that allows to control the amount of interaction between
channels. We give insights into the general behavior of the method, before we
further tailor it to a particular application, namely PET-MRI joint
reconstruction. To do so, we compute joint reconstruction results from blurry
Poisson data for PET and undersampled Fourier data from MRI and show that we
can gain a mutual benefit for both modalities. In particular, the results are
superior to the respective separate reconstructions and other joint

technique to handle the resulting constrained optimization problem is
developed. Specifically, it is shown that the new family of distribution-free
estimators shares a shrinkagetype form; besides, the eigenvalues estimate just
requires the solution of a one-dimensional convex problem whose objective
function depends on the considered unitary norm. For the two most common norm
instances, i.e., Frobenius and spectral, very efficient algorithms are
developed to solve the aforementioned one-dimensional optimization leading to
almost closed form covariance estimates. At the analysis stage, the performance
of the new estimators is assessed in terms of achievable Signal to Interference

different data statistical characterizations. The results show that interesting

covariant with respect to the asymptotic geometry. One single calculation and
the same universal result works for both dS and AdS geometry or in case of AdS
for both global AdS and Poincare patch. We have checked our final answer with
various known exact solutions and the known spectrum of Quasi Normal modes in

weighted graphs. More specifically, we focus on the design of compact
name-independent fault-tolerant routing schemes, where the designer of the
scheme is not allowed to assign names to nodes, i.e., the name of a node is
just its identifier. Given a set $F$ of faulty (or forbidden) edges, the goal
is to route from a source node $s$ to a target $t$ avoiding the forbidden edges
in $F$.
  Given any name-dependent fault-tolerant routing scheme and any
name-independent routing scheme, we show how to use them as a black box to
construct a name-independent fault-tolerant routing scheme. In particular, we
present a name-independent routing scheme able to handle any set $F$ of
forbidden edges in $|F|+1$ connected graphs. This has stretch
$O(k^2\,|F|^3(|F|+\log^2 n)\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. It
uses tables of size $ \widetilde{O}(k\, n^{1/k}(k + deg(v)))$ bits at every

that suffer only from occasional failures, we present a name-independent
routing scheme that handles only $1$ fault at a time, and another routing
scheme that handles at most $2$ faults at a time. The former uses
$\widetilde{O}(k^2\, n^{1/k} + k\,deg(v))$ bits of memory per node, with
stretch $O(k^3\log D)$. The latter consumes in average $ \widetilde{O}(k^2

complex networks is often critical to their functionality. However, real-world
networked dynamical systems operating synchronously are prone to random
perturbations driving the system to arbitrary states within the corresponding
basin of attraction, thereby leading to epochs of desynchronized dynamics with
a priori unknown durations. Thus, it is highly relevant to have an estimate of
the duration of such transient phases before the system returns to synchrony,
following a random perturbation to the dynamical state of any particular node
of the network. We address this issue here by proposing the framework of
\emph{single-node recovery time} (SNRT) which provides an estimate of the
relative time scales underlying the transient dynamics of the nodes of a
network during its restoration to synchrony. We utilize this in differentiating
the particularly \emph{slow} nodes of the network from the relatively
\emph{fast} nodes, thus identifying the critical nodes which when perturbed
lead to significantly enlarged recovery time of the system before resuming
synchronized operation. Further, we reveal explicit relationships between the
SNRT values of a network, and its \emph{global relaxation time} when starting
all the nodes from random initial conditions. We employ the proposed concept
for deducing microscopic relationships between topological features of nodes
and their respective SNRT values. The framework of SNRT is further extended to
a measure of resilience of the different nodes of a networked dynamical system.
We demonstrate the potential of SNRT in networks of R\""{o}ssler oscillators on
paradigmatic topologies and a model of the power grid of the United Kingdom
with second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics illustrating the conceivable
practical applicability of the proposed concept.

photosphere are being reported for an M-class flare that originated at a
$\delta$-spot belonging to active region NOAA 11865.
  Methods: High-resolution ground-based near-infrared spectropolarimetric
observations were acquired simultaneously in two photospheric spectral lines,
Fe I 10783 \AA\ and Si I 10786 \AA, with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at
the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) in Tenerife on 2013 October 15. The
observations covered several stages of the M-class flare. Inversions of the
full-Stokes vector of both lines were carried out and the results were put into
context using (extreme)-ultraviolet filtergrams from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO).
  Results: The active region showed high flaring activity during the whole
observing period. After the M-class flare, the longitudinal magnetic field did
not show significant changes along the polarity inversion line (PIL). However,
an enhancement of the transverse magnetic field of approximately 550 G was
found that bridges the PIL and connects umbrae of opposite polarities in the
$\delta$-spot. At the same time, a newly formed system of loops appeared
co-spatially in the corona as seen in 171 \AA\ filtergrams of the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO. However, we cannot exclude that the
magnetic connection between the umbrae already existed in the upper atmosphere
before the M-class flare and became visible only later when it was filled with
hot plasma. The photospheric Doppler velocities show a persistent upflow
pattern along the PIL without significant changes due to the flare.
  Conclusions: The increase of the transverse component of the magnetic field
after the flare together with the newly formed loop system in the corona
support recent predictions of flare models and flare observations.

which one must perform a sequence of possibly dependent decisions, without
receiving feedback information on the effectiveness of previously made actions.
Informally, the problem considers a set of $d$ doors that are initially closed,
and the aim is to open all of them as fast as possible. To open a door, the
algorithm knocks on it and it might open or not according to some probability
distribution. This distribution may depend on which other doors are currently
open, as well as on which other doors were open during each of the previous
knocks on that door. The algorithm aims to minimize the expected time until all
doors open. Crucially, it must act at any time without knowing whether or which
other doors have already opened. In this work, we focus on scenarios where
dependencies between doors are both positively correlated and acyclic.The
fundamental distribution of a door describes the probability it opens in the
best of conditions (with respect to other doors being open or closed). We show
that if in two configurations of $d$ doors corresponding doors share the same
fundamental distribution, then these configurations have the same optimal
running time up to a universal constant, no matter what are the dependencies
between doors and what are the distributions. We also identify algorithms that
are optimal up to a universal constant factor. For the case in which all doors
share the same fundamental distribution we additionally provide a simpler
algorithm, and a formula to calculate its running time. We furthermore analyse
the price of lacking feedback for several configurations governed by standard
fundamental distributions. In particular, we show that the price is logarithmic
in $d$ for memoryless doors, but can potentially grow to be linear in $d$ for
other distributions.We then turn our attention to investigate precise bounds.
Even for the case of two doors, identifying the optimal sequence is an
intriguing combinatorial question. Here, we study the case of two cascading
memoryless doors. That is, the first door opens on each knock independently
with probability $p\_1$. The second door can only open if the first door is
open, in which case it will open on each knock independently with probability
$p\_2$. We solve this problem almost completely by identifying algorithms that
are optimal up to an additive term of 1.

general circulation of the atmosphere or convective motions. Isentropic
analyses are commonly based on studies of different equivalent potential
temperatures, all of which are assumed to fully represent the entropy of moist
air. It is, however, possible to rely either on statistical physics or the
third law of thermodynamics when defining and computing the absolute entropy of
moist air and to study the corresponding third-law potential temperature, which
is different from the previous ones. The third law assumes that the entropy for
the most stable crystalline state of all substances is zero when approaching
absolute zero temperature.
  This paper shows that the way all these moist-air potential temperatures are
defined has a large impact on: (i) the plotting of the isentropes for a
simulation of the Hurricane DUMILE; (ii) the changes in moist-air entropy
computed for a steam cycle defined for this Hurricane; (iii) the analyses of
isentropic stream functions computed for this Hurricane; and (iv) the
computations of the heat input, the work function, and the efficiency defined
for this steam cycle.
  The moist-air entropy is a state function and the isentropic analyses must be
completely determined by the local moist-air conditions. The large differences
observed between the different formulations of moist-air entropy are
interpreted as proof that the isentropic analyses of moist-air atmospheric
motions must be achieved by using the third-law potential temperature defined
from general thermodynamics.

$\simeq 3$ times the physical charm mass. The interpolation to the physical
$b$-quark mass is performed using the ETMC ratio method, based on ratios of the
meson masses computed at nearby heavy-quark masses, and adopting the kinetic
mass scheme. The extrapolation to the physical pion mass and to the continuum
limit yields $m_b^{\rm kin}(1~\mbox{GeV}) = 4.61 (20)$ GeV, which corresponds
to $\overline{m}_b(\overline{m}_b) = 4.26 (18)$ GeV in the $\overline{MS}$

$\mu_\pi^2 = 0.321 (32)$ GeV$^2$ and $\mu_G^2(m_b) = 0.253 (25)$ GeV$^2$. The

that the canonical distribution of amorphous materials is Gaussian
distribution, we generate multiple amorphous structures with several different
volumes by CPMD simulations and average the total energies at each volume. The
density is then determined to be the one that minimizes the averaged total
energy. In this study, this approach is implemented for amorphous silicon
({$a$-Si}) to demonstrate its validity, and we have determined the density of
{$a$-Si} to be 4.1 % lower and its bulk modulus to be 28 GPa smaller than those

Typically, movie features are human-generated, either editorially (e.g., genre

they are prone to noise and are expensive to collect. Moreover, these features
are often rare or absent for new items, making it difficult or even impossible

  In this paper, we show that user's preferences on movies can be better
described in terms of the mise-en-sc\`ene features, i.e., the visual aspects of
a movie that characterize design, aesthetics and style (e.g., colors,
textures). We use both MPEG-7 visual descriptors and Deep Learning hidden
layers as example of mise-en-sc\`ene features that can visually describe
movies. Interestingly, mise-en-sc\`ene features can be computed automatically

in case one consider trajectories of truly quantum objects such as single

particles, but not for waves. The wave-particle duality forces a breakdown of
this dichotomy and quantum mechanics resolves this in a remarkable way:
Trajectories can be well defined, but they are utterly different from classical
trajectories. Here, we give an operational definition to the trajectory of a
single photon by introducing a novel technique to mark its path using its
spectral composition. The method demonstrates that the frequency degree of
freedom can be used as a bona fide quantum measurement device (meter). The
analysis of a number of setups, using our operational definition, leads to
anomalous trajectories which are non-continuous and in some cases do not even
connect the source of the photon to where it is detected. We carried out an
experimental demonstration of these anomalous trajectories using a nested

stabilizing field is taken into account. In such a scenario, we explore the
role of backreaction on the localization of bulk fermions which in turn
determines the effective radion-fermion coupling on the brane. Our result
reveals that both the chiral modes of the zeroth Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermions get
localized near TeV brane as the backreaction of the scalar field increases. We
also show that the profile of massive KK fermions shifts towards the Planck

deep inelastic scattering (DIS) off the lightest nuclei tagged by a recoil
nucleon. These processes hold a lot of potential for resolving the outstanding
issues related to the dynamics of hadronization in QCD. Within the minimal Fock
component framework, valid at large Bjorken $x$, the main features of the
theoretical approach based on the virtual nucleon approximation are elaborated.
In this approach, the strong final-state interaction of the DIS products with
the nuclear fragments is described by an effective eikonal amplitude, whose
parameters can be extracted from the analysis of semi-inclusive DIS off the
deuteron target. The extraction of the $Q^2$ and $W$ mass dependences of these
parameters gives a new observable in studying the QCD structure of DIS final
states. Another important feature of tagged DIS off the lightest nuclei is the
possibility of performing pole extrapolation with a high degree of accuracy.
Such extrapolation allows an extraction of the neutron structure function in a
model independent way due to suppression of the final-state interaction in the
on-shell limit of the struck nucleon propagator. We review the first
application of the pole extrapolation to recent experimental data. Finally, we
outline the extension of the framework to inclusive DIS, including a polarized
deuteron target as well as its application to the tagged DIS reactions for
future experiments at fixed target and collider energies.

interaction as a periodic perturbation in the magphonic crystal. The results of

presented resonant coupling in the magphonic crystal is an active in-space
mechanism which spatially transfers energy between propagating spin and
acoustic modes, thus creating propagating magnetoelastic wave. We have shown,
that CMT analysis of the magnetoelastic coupling is an useful tool to optimize

is anomalous and broken by the solutions. If the $1/r^2$ potential is strong

the prospect of an Efimov-like geometrical spectrum in two-hadron systems. For
a molecular pentaquark with quantum numbers $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ the attraction is
not enough to exhibit discrete scale invariance, but this prospect might very

scenarios that we explore, the jet sheath is the most promising candidate for
being the main source of Faraday rotation. During the one-year observing period
the RM trend shows two sign reversals, which may be qualitatively interpreted
within the context of the magnetic tower models. We invoke the presence of two
nested helical magnetic fields in the relativistic jet with opposite
helicities, whose relative contribution produce the observed RM values. The
inner helical field has the poloidal component ($B_{\rm p}$) oriented in the
observer's direction and produces a positive RM, while the outer helical field,
with $B_{\rm p}$ in the opposite direction, produces a negative RM. We assume
that the external helical field dominates the contribution to the observed RM,
while the internal helical field dominates when a jet perturbation arises

superconductivity is spin-fluctuation driven and intimately related to their
fermiology, specifically, hole and electron pockets separated by the same wave
vector that characterizes the dominant spin fluctuations, and supporting order
parameters (OP) of opposite signs. This picture was questioned after the
discovery of a new family, based on the FeSe layers, either intercalated or in
the monolayer form. The critical temperatures there reach ~40 K, the same as in
optimally doped bulk FeSe - despite the fact that intercalation removes the
hole pockets from the Fermi level and, seemingly, undermines the basis for the
spin-fluctuation theory and the idea of a sign-changing OP. In this paper,
using the recently proposed phase-sensitive quasiparticle interference
technique, we show that in LiOH intercalated FeSe compound the OP does change
sign, albeit within the electronic pockets, and not between the hole and
electron ones. This result unifies the pairing mechanism of iron based
superconductors with or without the hole Fermi pockets and supports the
conclusion that spin fluctuations play the key role in electron pairing.

calibrated with the slope heuristics, to select the number of clusters present

last years for other e+/e- colliders like PEP-II, KEKB, DAFNE, SuperB and
SuperKEKB. In all these cases, similar approaches have been implemented, even
if some design variations have been suitable or necessary for different
reasons. Bunch-by-bunch feedback systems are based on the concept that the
barycenter of each bunch moves with harmonic motion around the equilibrium
point in three planes (L, H, V). The feedback copes with the forcing excitation
by producing damping correction for each individual bunch. This is possible
managing every single bunch by a dedicated processing channel in real time. For
FCC-ee the very high number of stored bunches requires much more power in terms
of processing capability for the feedback systems. Ring length (100 Km) and

  connectivity layers",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to rigorously study dynamics of Heterogeneously
Coupled Maps (HCM). Such systems are determined by a network with heterogeneous
degrees. Some nodes, called hubs, are very well connected while most nodes
interact with few others. The local dynamics on each node is chaotic, coupled
with other nodes according to the network structure. Such high-dimensional
systems are hard to understand in full, nevertheless we are able to describe
the system over exponentially large time scales. In particular, we show that
the dynamics of hub nodes can be very well approximated by a low-dimensional
system. This allows us to establish the emergence of macroscopic behaviour such
as coherence of dynamics among hubs of the same connectivity layer (i.e. with
the same number of connections), and chaotic behaviour of the poorly connected
nodes. The HCM we study provide a paradigm to explain why and how the dynamics
of the network can change across layers.

around black holes. We consider a fluid described by a relativistic equation of
state, flowing about the axis of symmetry ($\theta=0$) in a Schwarzschild
metric. We use two models for the jet geometry, (i) a conical geometry and (ii)
a geometry with non-conical cross-section. Jet with conical geometry is smooth
flow. While the jet with non-conical cross section undergoes multiple sonic
point and even standing shock. The jet shock becomes stronger, as the shock
location is situated further from the central black hole. Jets with very high
energy and very low energy do not harbour shocks, but jets with intermediate
energies do harbour shocks. One advantage of these shocks, as opposed to shocks
mediated by external medium is that, these shocks have no effect on the jet
terminal speed, but may act as possible sites for particle acceleration.
Typically, a jet with energy $1.8~c^2$, will achieve a terminal speed of
$v_\infty=0.813c$ for jet with any geometry. But for a jet of non-conical
cross-section for which the length scale of the inner torus of the accretion
disc is $40\rg$, then in addition, a steady shock will form at $\rsh \sim
7.5\rg$ and compression ratio of $R\sim 2.7$. Moreover, electron-proton jet
seems to harbour the strongest shock. We discuss possible consequences of such
a scenario.

predictions showing that measurements over a range of frequencies can be
particularly important for constraining the emission location, radiation
mechanisms and system geometry. The results assume a generic model for emission
from the outer magnetosphere and current sheet in which optical to hard X-ray
emission is produced by synchrotron radiation from electron-positron pairs and
gamma-ray emission is produced by curvature radiation or synchrotron radiation
from accelerating primary electrons. The magnetic field structure of a
force-free magnetosphere is assumed and the phase-resolved and phase-averaged
polarization is calculated in the frame of an inertial observer. We find that
large position angle swings and deep depolarization dips occur during the light
curve peaks in all energy bands. For synchrotron emission, the polarization
characteristics are strongly dependent on photon emission radius with larger,
nearly $180^\circ$, position angle swings for emission outside the light
cylinder as the line-of-sight crosses the current sheet. The phase-averaged
polarization degree for synchrotron radiation is less that 10% and around 20%
for emission starting inside and outside the light cylinder respectively, while
the polarization degree for curvature radiation is much larger, up to 40% -
60%. Observing a sharp increase in polarization degree and a change in position
angle at the transition between X-ray and gamma-ray spectral components would
indicate that curvature radiation is the gamma-ray emission mechanism.

stochastic gravitational wave background. While the computation of its mean
density as a function of frequency in a homogeneous and isotropic universe is
standard lore, the computation of its anisotropies requires to understand the
coarse graining from local systems, to galactic scales and then to cosmology.
An expression of the gravitational wave energy density valid in any general
spacetime is derived. It is then specialized to a perturbed
Friedmann-Lema\^itre spacetime in order to determine the angular power spectrum
of this stochastic background as well as its correlation with other
cosmological probes, such as the galaxy number counts and weak lensing. Our
result for the angular power spectrum also provides an expression for the
variance of the gravitational wave background.

Analogous to how online algorithms receive their input piece-by-piece, our
model presents one of the players, Bob, his input piece-by-piece, and has the
players Alice and Bob cooperate to compute a result each time before the next
piece is revealed to Bob. This model has a closer and more natural
correspondence to dynamic data structures than classic communication models do,
and hence presents a new perspective on data structures.
  We first present a tight lower bound for the online set intersection problem
in the online communication model, demonstrating a general approach for proving
online communication lower bounds. The online communication model prevents a
batching trick that classic communication complexity allows, and yields a
stronger lower bound. We then apply the online communication model to prove
data structure lower bounds for two dynamic data structure problems: the Group
Range problem and the Dynamic Connectivity problem for forests. Both of the
problems admit a worst case $O(\log n)$-time data structure. Using online
communication complexity, we prove a tight cell-probe lower bound for each:
spending $o(\log n)$ (even amortized) time per operation results in at best an
$\exp(-\delta^2 n)$ probability of correctly answering a
$(1/2+\delta)$-fraction of the $n$ queries.

measurements of sea surface height assuming a geostrophic balance. Recent
nonlinear dynamical systems techniques have revealed that surface currents
derived from altimetry can support mesoscale eddies with material boundaries
that do not filament for many months, thereby representing effective transport
mechanisms. However, the long-range Lagrangian coherence assessed for mesoscale
eddy boundaries detected from altimetry is constrained by the impossibility of
current altimeters to resolve ageostrophic submesoscale motions. These may act
to prevent Lagrangian coherence from manifesting in the rigorous form described
by the nonlinear dynamical systems theories. Here we use a combination of
satellite ocean color and surface drifter trajectory data, rarely available
simultaneously over an extended period of time, to provide observational
evidence for the enduring Lagrangian coherence of a Loop Current ring detected
from altimetry. We also seek indications of this behavior in the flow produced
by a data-assimilative system which demonstrated ability to reproduce observed
relative dispersion statistics down into the marginally submesoscale range.
However, the simulated flow, total surface and subsurface or subsampled
emulating altimetry, is not found to support the long-lasting Lagrangian
coherence that characterizes the observed ring. This highlights the importance
of the Lagrangian metrics produced by the nonlinear dynamical systems tools
employed here in assessing model performance.

topology optimization is how to design structures that are self-supportive in a
manufacture process without introducing additional supporting materials. In the
present contribution, it is intended to resolve this problem under an explicit
topology optimization framework where optimal structural topology can be found
by optimizing a set of explicit geometry parameters. Two solution approaches
established based on the Moving Morphable Components (MMC) and Moving Morphable
Voids (MMV) frameworks, respectively, are proposed and some theoretical issues
associated with AM oriented topology optimization are also analyzed. Numerical
examples provided demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

provide direct access to the transport properties of the Dirac cone in real

we use scanning tunnelling potentiometry to analyse the resistance of different
kinds of defects at the surface of a (Bi0.53Sb0.47)2Te3 topological insulator
thin film. The largest localized voltage drop we find to be located at domain
boundaries in the topological insulator film, with a resistivity about four
times higher than that of a step edge. Furthermore, we resolve resistivity
dipoles located around nanoscale voids in the sample surface. The influence of
such defects on the resistance of the topological surface state is analysed by
means of a resistor network model. The effect resulting from the voids is found
to be small compared to the other defects.

an ultrathin Mg insertion layer (<= 2 nm) in Fe/Mg/MgO/n+-Si tunnel junctions.
In diode-type vertical three-terminal devices fabricated on a Si substrate, we
observed the narrower three-terminal Hanle (N-3TH) signals indicating true spin
injection into Si, and estimated the spin polarization in Si to be 16% when the
thickness of the Mg insertion layer is 1 nm, whereas no N-3TH signal was
observed without Mg insertion. This means that the spin injection/extraction
efficiency is enhanced by suppressing the formation of a magnetically-dead
layer at the Fe/MgO interface. We have also observed clear spin transport
signals, such as non-local Hanle signals and spin-valve signals, in a lateral
four-terminal device with the same Fe/Mg/MgO/n+-Si tunnel junctions fabricated
on a Si-on-insulator substrate. It was found that both the intensity and
linewidth of the spin signals are affected by the geometrical effects (device
geometry and size). We have derived analytical functions taking into account
the device structures, including channel thickness and electrode size, and
estimated important parameters; spin lifetime and spin polarizations. Our
analytical functions well explain the experimental results. Our study shows the

inspired by the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we
employ an adversarial training architecture and name it as Adversarial-NMT. In
Adversarial-NMT, the training of the NMT model is assisted by an adversary,
which is an elaborately designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal
of the adversary is to differentiate the translation result generated by the
NMT model from that by human. The goal of the NMT model is to produce high
quality translations so as to cheat the adversary. A policy gradient method is
leveraged to co-train the NMT model and the adversary. Experimental results on
English$\rightarrow$French and German$\rightarrow$English translation tasks
show that Adversarial-NMT can achieve significantly better translation quality
than several strong baselines.

  Oscillators",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clock synchronization is a widely discussed topic in the engineering
literature. Ensuring that individual clocks are closely aligned is important in
network systems, since the correct timing of various events in a network is
usually necessary for proper system implementation. However, many existing
clock synchronization algorithms update clock values abruptly, resulting in
discontinuous clocks which have been shown to lead to undesirable behavior. In
this paper, we propose using the pulse-coupled oscillator model to guarantee
clock continuity, demonstrating two general methods for achieving continuous
phase evolution in any pulse-coupled oscillator network. We provide rigorous
mathematical proof that the pulse-coupled oscillator algorithm is able to
converge to the synchronized state when the phase continuity methods are
applied. We provide simulation results supporting these proofs. We further
investigate the convergence behavior of other pulse-coupled oscillator
synchronization algorithms using the proposed methods.

particular, the connection between the phase singularities and polarization
helicities in the longitudinal components of the fundamental and
second-harmonic optical fields and the scatterer symmetry properties are
discussed. By in-depth comparison between the interaction of structured optical
beams with plasmonic and dielectric nanostructures, we have found that
all-dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures that exhibit magnetic and electric

mechanisms for second-harmonic enhancement for single and chiral clusters of
scatterers are unveiled and the relationships between the content of optical
angular momentum of the incident optical beams and the enhancement of nonlinear

momenta conservation law for the nonlinear spin-orbital angular momentum
interaction, which includes the quasi-angular-momentum of chiral structures
with different-order rotational symmetry. As a key conclusion of our study
relevant to nanophotonics, we argue that all-dielectric nanostructures provide
a more suitable platform to investigate experimentally the nonlinear

time-evolving pattern (or signal) to a gold standard in order to recognize or
characterize the meaning of a dynamic phenomenon. Examples include matching

paper shows that all of these problems can be aided by reparameterizing the
temporal dependence of each signal individually to a universal standard
timescale that allows pointwise comparison at each instance of time. Given two
sequences, each with $N$ timesteps, the complexity of the algorithm has a cost
of $O(N)$, which is an improvement on the most common method for matching two

that the universal standard timescale is found by solving a variational

produces a mapping to a new temporal variable in which the amount of change is
globally minimized. The result builds on known facts in differential geometry.

geomagnetic storm on record, known as the 1859 Carrington event, was so intense
that ground-based magnetometers were saturated at high magnetic latitudes. The
most reliable, un-saturated observation is the hour-resolution data from the

play a significant role in GIC-related effects. We present a new method for
scaling higher frequency observations to create a realistic Carrington-like

magnetic field model and ground conductivity models, we produce an electric
