development of new technologies based on 2D materials. However, current
synthesis methods suffer from a variety of drawbacks, including limitations in
crystal size and stability. Here, we report the fabrication of large-area,
high-quality 2D tellurium (tellurene) using a substrate-free solution process.
Our approach can create crystals with a process-tunable thickness, from
monolayer to tens of nanometres, and with lateral sizes of up to 100 um. The
chiral-chain van der Waals structure of tellurene gives rise to strong in-plane
anisotropic properties and large thickness dependent shifts in Raman
vibrational modes, which is not observed in other 2D layered materials. We also
fabricate tellurene field-effect transistors, which exhibit air-stable
performance at room temperature for over two months, on off ratios on the order
of 106 and field-effect mobilities of around 700 cm2 per Vs. Furthermore, by
scaling down the channel length and integrating with high-k dielectrics,
transistors with a significant on-state current density of 1 A mm-1 are
demonstrated.

equation of motion through a superoperator known as the memory kernel, which
encodes how past states affect future dynamics. However, the usual prescription
for determining the memory kernel requires information about the underlying
system-environment dynamics. Here, by deriving the transfer tensor method from
first principles, we show how a memory kernel master equation, for any quantum
process, can be entirely expressed in terms of a family of completely positive
dynamical maps. These can be reconstructed through quantum process tomography
on the system alone, either experimentally or numerically, and the resulting
equation of motion is equivalent to a generalised Nakajima-Zwanzig equation.
For experimental settings, we give a full prescription for the reconstruction
procedure, rendering the memory kernel operational. When simulation of an open
system is the goal, we show how our procedure yields a considerable advantage
for numerically calculating dynamics, even when the system is arbitrarily
periodically (or transiently) driven or initially correlated with its
environment. Namely, we show that the long time dynamics can be efficiently
obtained from a set of reconstructed maps over a much shorter time.

whenever a set of inventories or stocks has to be valued. Such is the case in
seasonal storage valuation of a set of cascaded reservoir chains in hydro
management. A popular method is Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP),
especially when the dimensionality of the problem is large and Dynamic
programming no longer an option. The usual assumption of SDDP is that
uncertainty is stage-wise independent, which is highly restrictive from a
practical viewpoint. When possible, the usual remedy is to increase the
state-space to account for some degree of dependency. In applications this may
not be possible or it may increase the state space by too much. In this paper
we present an alternative based on keeping a functional dependency in the SDDP
- cuts related to the conditional expectations in the dynamic programming
equations. Our method is based on popular methodology in mathematical finance,
where it has progressively replaced scenario trees due to superior numerical
performance. On a set of numerical examples, we too show the interest of this
way of handling dependency in uncertainty, when combined with SDDP. Our method
is readily available in the open source software package StOpt.

Engineering such quantum systems offers the opportunity to explore extreme
regimes of light-matter interaction that are inaccessible with natural systems.
For instance the coupling strength $g$ can be increased until it is comparable
with the atomic or mode frequency $\omega_{a,m}$ and the atom can be coupled to
multiple modes which has always challenged our understanding of light-matter

capacitance formed by a vacuum-gap capacitance with the center conductor of a
coplanar waveguide resonator. In addition to potential applications in quantum

protects the VO2 lattice from corrosion, but also causes pronounced

different state transfer methods to guide future design decisions. Here, we
theoretically investigate quantum state transfer between two distant qubits,
each in a cavity, connected by a waveguide, e.g., an optical fiber. We evaluate
the achievable success probabilities of state transfer for two different
protocols: standard wave packet shaping and adiabatic passage. The main loss
sources are transmission losses in the waveguide and absorption losses in the
cavities. While special cases studied in the literature indicate that adiabatic
passages may be beneficial in this context, it remained an open question under
which conditions this is the case and whether their use will be advantageous in
practice. We answer these questions by providing a full analysis, showing that
state transfer by adiabatic passage -- in contrast to wave packet shaping --
can mitigate the effects of undesired cavity losses, far beyond the regime of
coupling to a single waveguide mode and the regime of lossless waveguides, as
was proposed so far. Furthermore, we show that the photon arrival probability
is in fact bounded in a trade-off between losses due to non-adiabaticity and
due to coupling to off-resonant waveguide modes. We clarify that neither
protocol can avoid transmission losses and discuss how the cavity parameters
should be chosen to achieve an optimal state transfer.

around young stellar objects (YSOs), which suggest that efficient grain growth
may have occurred earlier than the Class I stage. The present work makes use of
abundant archival interferometric observations at submillimeter,millimeter, and
centimeter wavelength bands to examine grain growth signatures in the dense
inner regions (<1000 AU) of nine Class 0 YSOs. A systematic data analysis is
performed to derive dust temperatures, optical depths, and dust opacity indices
based on single-component modified black body fittings to the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). The fitted dust opacity indices (beta) are in a wide
range of 0.3 to 2.0 when single-component SED fitting is adopted. Four out of
the nine observed sources show beta lower than 1.7, the typical value of the
interstellar dust. Low dust opacity index (or spectral index) values may be
explained by the effect of dust grain growth, which makes beta<1.7.
Alternatively, the very small observed values of beta may be interpreted by the
presence of deeply embedded hot inner disks, which only significantly
contribute to the observed fluxes at long wavelength bands. This possibility
can be tested by the higher angular resolution imaging observations of ALMA, or
more detailed sampling of SEDs in the millimeter and centimeter bands. The beta

investigate the influence of the surface albedo $A_{\rm s}$, the optical

$\eta$ of biosignature O$_2$ on the strength of the O$_2$ A-band (around 760
nm) in flux and polarization spectra of starlight reflected by Earth-like
exoplanets. Our computations for horizontally homogeneous planets show that
small mixing ratios ($\eta$ < 0.4) will yield moderately deep bands in flux and
moderate to small band strengths in polarization, and that clouds will usually
decrease the band depth in flux and the band strength in polarization. However,
cloud influence will be strongly dependent on their properties such as optical
thickness, top altitude, particle phase, coverage fraction, horizontal
distribution. Depending on the surface albedo, and cloud properties, different
O$_2$ mixing ratios $\eta$ can give similar absorption band depths in flux and
band strengths in polarization, in particular if the clouds have moderate to
high optical thicknesses. Measuring both the flux and the polarization is
essential to reduce the degeneracies, although it will not solve them, in
particular not for horizontally inhomogeneous planets. Observations at a wide
range of phase angles and with a high temporal resolution could help to derive
cloud properties and, once those are known, the mixing ratio of O$_2$ or any
other absorbing gas.

challenging due to the fact that the neutron has no net charge. In addition,
measurements of the neutron form factors must use nuclear targets which require
accurately accounting for nuclear effects. Extracting $G^n_E$ with different
targets and techniques provides an important test of our handling of these
effects. $[Purpose]$ The goal of the measurement was to use an inclusive
asymmetry measurement technique to extract the neutron charge form factor at a
four-momentum transfer of $1~(\rm{GeV/c})^2$. This technique has very different
systematic uncertainties than traditional exclusive measurements and thus
serves as an independent check of whether nuclear effects have been taken into
account correctly. $[Method]$ The inclusive quasi-elastic reaction
$^3\overrightarrow{\rm{He}}(\overrightarrow{e},e')$ was measured at Jefferson
Lab. The neutron electric form factor, $G_E^n$, was extracted at $Q^2 =
0.98~(\rm{GeV/c})^2$ from ratios of electron-polarization asymmetries measured
for two orthogonal target spin orientations. This $Q^2$ is high enough that the
sensitivity to $G_E^n$ is not overwhelmed by the neutron magnetic contribution,
and yet low enough that explicit neutron detection is not required to suppress
pion production. $[Results]$ The neutron electric form factor, $G_E^n$, was
determined to be $0.0414\pm0.0077\;{(stat)}\pm0.0022\;{(syst)}$; providing the
first high precision inclusive extraction of the neutron's charge form factor.
$[Conclusions]$ The use of the inclusive quasi-elastic
$^3\overrightarrow{\rm{He}}(\overrightarrow{e},e')$ with a four-momentum
transfer near $1~(\rm{GeV/c})^2$ has been used to provide a unique measurement
of $G^n_E$. This new result provides a systematically independent validation of
the exclusive extraction technique results.

centers of galaxies. Similarly to their galactic-scale counterparts, nuclear
spiral arms can perturb the orbits of stars. In the case of the Galactic Center
(GC), these perturbations can affect the orbits of stars and binaries in a
region extending to several hundred parsecs around the supermassive black hole
(MBH), causing diffusion in orbital energy and angular momentum. This diffusion
process can drive stars and binaries to close approaches with the MBH,
disrupting single stars in tidal disruption events (TDEs), or disrupting
binaries, leaving a star tightly bound to the MBH, and an unbound star escaping
the galaxy, i.e., a hypervelocity star (HVS). Here, we consider diffusion by
nuclear spiral arms in galactic nuclei, specifying to the Milky Way GC. We
determine nuclear spiral arm-driven diffusion rates using test-particle
integrations, and compute disruption rates. Our TDE rates are up to 20% higher
compared to relaxation by single stars. For binaries, the enhancement is up to
a factor of ~100, and our rates are comparable to the observed numbers of HVSs
and S-stars. Our scenario is complementary to relaxation driven by massive
perturbers. In addition, our rates depend on the inclination of the binary with
respect to the Galactic plane. Therefore, our scenario provides a novel
potential source for the observed anisotropic distribution of HVSs. Nuclear
spiral arms may also be important for accelerating the coalescence of binary
MBHs, and for supplying nuclear star clusters with stars and gas.

approximate aspects of hydrodynamics in hydrostatic codes. In particular, the
effect of hydrodynamic instabilities in rotating stars, for example, dynamical
shear instability, evades consistent description. We intend to study the
accuracy of the diffusion approximation to dynamical shear in hydrostatic
stellar evolution models by comparing 1D models to a first-principle
hydrodynamics simulation starting from the same initial conditions. We chose an
initial model calculated with the stellar evolution code GENEC that is just at
the onset of a dynamical shear instability but does not show any other
instabilities (e.g., convection). This was mapped to the hydrodynamics code SLH
to perform a 2D simulation in the equatorial plane. We compare the resulting
profiles in the two codes and compute an effective diffusion coefficient for
the hydro simulation. Shear instabilities develop in the 2D simulation in the
regions predicted by linear theory to become unstable in the 1D model. Angular
velocity and chemical composition is redistributed in the unstable region,
thereby creating new unstable regions. Eventually the 2D simulation settles in
a symmetric, steady state, which is Richardson stable everywhere, whereas the
instability remains for longer in the 1D model due to current limitations in
the 1D code. A spatially resolved diffusion coefficient is extracted by
comparing the initial and final profiles of mean atomic mass. The presented
simulation gives a first insight on hydrodynamics of shear instabilities in a
real stellar environment and even allows us to directly extract an effective
diffusion coefficient. We see evidence for a critical Richardson number of 0.25
as regions above this value remain stable for the course of the simulation.

raises the question of whether clusters with such low densities can survive the
tidal field of cold dark matter haloes with central density cusps. Using both
analytic arguments and a suite of collisionless N-body simulations, I show that
these clusters are extremely fragile and quickly disrupted in the presence of
central cusps $\rho\sim r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\gtrsim 0.2$. Furthermore, the
scenario in which the clusters where originally more massive and sank to the
center of the halo requires extreme fine tuning and does not naturally
reproduce the observed systems. In turn, these clusters are long lived in cored
haloes, whose central regions are safe shelters for $\alpha\lesssim 0.2$. The
only viable scenario for hosts that have preserved their primoridal cusp to the
present time is that the clusters formed at rest at the bottom of the
potential, which is easily tested by measurement of the clusters proper
velocity within the host. This offers means to readily probe the central
density profile of two dwarf galaxies as faint as $L_V\sim5\times 10^5 L_\odot$

< 10.5. These measurements constrain the internal dynamics, the intrinsic
velocity dispersions ({\sigma}$_{int}$) and rotation velocities (V$_{C}$) of
galaxies in the high redshift Universe. The mean velocity dispersion of the
galaxies in our sample is {\sigma}$_{int}$ = $70.8^{+3.3}_{-3.1}$ km s$^{-1}$,
revealing that the increasing average {\sigma}$_{int}$ with increasing
redshift, reported for z $\lesssim2$, continues out to z $\simeq$ 3.5. Only 34
$\pm$ 8% of our galaxies are rotation-dominated (V$_{C}$/{\sigma}$_{int}$ > 1),
with the sample average V$_{C}$/{\sigma}$_{int}$ value much smaller than at
lower redshift. After carefully selecting comparable star-forming samples at
multiple epochs, we find that the rotation-dominated fraction evolves with
redshift with a z$^{-0.2}$ dependence. The rotation-dominated KDS galaxies show
no clear offset from the local rotation velocity-stellar mass (i.e.
V$_{C}$-M$_{\star}$) relation, although a smaller fraction of the galaxies are
on the relation due to the increase in the dispersion-dominated fraction. These
observations are consistent with a simple equilibrium model picture, in which
random motions are boosted in high redshift galaxies by a combination of the
increasing gas fractions, accretion efficiency, specific star-formation rate

the MW's stellar halo claim a detection of an isotropic or tangential ""dip"" at
r~20 kpc. Using the N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the temporal
persistence, population origin, and severity of ""dips"" in beta. We find dips in
the in situ stellar halo are long-lived, while dips in the accreted stellar
halo are short-lived and tied to the recent accretion of satellite material. We
also find that a major merger as early as z~1 can result in a present day low
(isotropic to tangential) value of beta over a wide range of radii and angular
expanse. While all of these mechanisms are plausible drivers for the beta dip
observed in the MW, in the simulations, each mechanism has a unique metallicity
signature associated with it, implying that future spectroscopic surveys could
distinguish between them. Since an accurate knowledge of beta(r) is required
for measuring the mass of the MW halo, we note significant transient dips in
beta could cause an overestimate of the halo's mass when using spherical Jeans
equation modeling.

into multiple disconnected pieces. In the absence of rotational symmetry, we
show that the notion of `valley pseudospin' in many-valley systems is
generically not transferred to the CFL, in agreement with experimental

discriminating quark- from gluon-initiated jets. Despite its utility, it is not
infrared and collinear (IRC) safe, so perturbative calculations are limited to
studying the energy evolution of multiplicity moments. While IRC-safe
observables, like jet mass, are perturbatively calculable, their distributions
often exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their quark/gluon discrimination power
is limited by the ratio of quark to gluon color factors. In this paper, we
introduce new IRC-safe counting observables whose discrimination performance
exceeds that of jet mass and approaches that of track multiplicity. The key
observation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,
with more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By
using an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can
define a ""soft drop multiplicity"" which is Poisson distributed at
leading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the
next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow
the soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we
can define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.
Exploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized
fragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of
collinear-unsafe multiplicity.

Measuring the projected linear sizes of these sources provides an indication of
their orientation. Steep-spectrum isotropic radio emission allows for
orientation-free sample selection at low radio frequencies. We use a new radio
survey of the Bo\""otes field at 150 MHz made with the Low Frequency Array

16 quasars with powers $P>10^{25.5}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz using cross-matched

4.4$\pm$1.4 larger than those with flat spectra. The projected linear sizes of
radio galaxies are on average 3.1$\pm$1.0 larger than those of quasars

with three previous surveys, we find that the projected linear sizes of radio

size ratio does not correlate with either parameter. The LOFAR data is
consistent within the uncertainties with theoretical predictions of the

and their evolution across cosmic time and find significant differences in the
spectral curvature between the SF galaxy and AGN populations. While the radio
spectra of SF galaxies exhibit a weak but statistically significant flattening,
AGN SEDs show a clear trend to become steeper towards lower frequencies. No
evolution of the spectral curvature as a function of redshift is found for SF
galaxies or AGN. We investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio

1.4 GHz radio luminosities decreases with increasing redshift: $ q_{\rm 1.4GHz}

simple exponentially declining SFH for each galaxy, along with a control sample
of field galaxies. We find that the time since quenching and the rate of
quenching do not correlate with the relative velocity of a satellite but are
correlated with the group potential. This quenching occurs within an average
quenching timescale of $\sim2.5~\rm{Gyr}$ from star forming to complete
quiescence, during an average infall time (from $\sim 10R_{200}$ to
$0.01R_{200}$) of $\sim 2.6~\rm{Gyr}$. Our results suggest that the environment
does play a direct role in galaxy quenching through quenching mechanisms which
are correlated with the group potential, such as harassment, interactions or
starvation. Environmental quenching mechanisms which are correlated with
satellite velocity, such as ram pressure stripping, are not the main cause of
quenching in the group environment. We find that no single mechanism dominates

interplay of mergers, mass & morphological quenching and environment driven
quenching mechanisms dependent on the group potential drive galaxy evolution in

demonstrated that the peak brightness is generally offset eastward from the
substellar point [1,2]. This observation is consistent with hydrodynamic
numerical simulations that produce fast, eastward directed winds which advect
the hottest point in the atmosphere eastward of the substellar point [3,4].
However, recent continuous Kepler measurements of HAT-P-7 b show that its peak
brightness offset varies significantly in time, with excursions such that the
brightest point is sometimes westward of the substellar point [5]. These
variations in brightness offset require wind variability, with or without the
presence of clouds. While such wind variability has not been seen in
hydrodynamic simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, it has been seen in
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations [6]. Here we show that MHD simulations of
HAT-P-7 b indeed display variable winds and corresponding variability in the
position of the hottest point in the atmosphere. Assuming the observed
variability in HAT-P-7 b is due to magnetism we constrain its minimum magnetic
field strength to be 6\,G. Similar observations of wind variability on hot
giant exoplanets, or lack thereof, could help constrain their magnetic field
strengths. Since dynamo simulations of these planets do not exist and
theoretical scaling relations [7] may not apply, such observational constraints

isophotal shapes), which trace galaxy light profiles at different radii. The
measured SA signal depends on these shape measurement methods. We detect the
strongest SA signal in isophotal shapes, followed by de Vaucouleurs shapes.
While no net SA signal is detected using re-Gaussianization shapes across the

when limiting to a subsample of higher luminosity satellites. We further
investigate the impact of noise, systematics, and real physical isophotal
twisting effects in the comparison between the SA signal detected via different

dependence of SA on a few parameters, here we explore a total of 17 galaxy and

account for parameter correlations and identify significant SA predictors. We
find that the measured SA signal is strongest for satellites with the following
characteristics: higher luminosity, smaller distance to the cluster center,
rounder in shape, higher bulge fraction, and distributed preferentially along
the major axis directions of their centrals. Finally, we provide physical

depending on age in order to study the secular evolution. We accounted for the
asymmetric drift computed from fitting a Stackel potential to orbits. Model
parameters such as velocity dispersions, mean motions, and velocity gradients
were adjusted using an ABC-MCMC method. We made use of the metallicity to
enhance the separation between thin and thick disks. We show that this model is
able to reproduce the kinematics of the local disks in great detail. The disk
follows the expected secular evolution, in very good agreement with previous
studies of the thin disk. The new asymmetric drift formula, fitted to our
previously described St\""ackel potential, fairly well reproduces the velocity
distribution in a wide solar neighborhood. The U and W components of the solar
motion determined with this method agree well with previous studies. However,
we find a smaller V component than previously thought, essentially because we
include the variation of the asymmetric drift with distance to the plane. The
thick disk is represented by a long period of formation (at least 2 Gyr),
during which, as we show, the mean velocity increases with time while the scale
height and scale length decrease, very consistently with a collapse phase with
conservation of angular momentum. This new Galactic dynamical model is able to
reproduce the observed velocities in a wide solar neighborhood at the quality
level of the TGAS-RAVE sample, allowing us to constrain the thin and thick disk

nebular spectra are relatively insensitive to most physical parameters.
Degeneracy among parameters precludes a unique determination of the ejecta
properties from spectral fitting. In particular, features can be equally well
fit with generic Chandrasekhar mass (M_ch), sub-M_Ch, and super-M_Ch models;
(2) A sizable (~0.1 Msun) central region of stable IGEs, often claimed as
evidence for M_Ch models, is not essential to fit the optical spectra and may
produce an unusual flat-top [CoIII] profile; (3) The strength of [SIII]
emission near 9500A can provide a useful diagnostic of explosion
nucleosynthesis; (4) Substantial amounts (~0.1 Msun) of unburned C/O mixed
throughout the ejecta produce [OIII] emission not seen in observations; (5)
Shifts in the wavelength of line peaks, sometimes used to infer ejecta
geometry, can also arise from line blending effects; (6) The steepness of the
ejecta density profile affects the line shapes, with flatter slopes providing
better fits to the observations of SN 2011fe, offering a constraint on
explosion models; (7) Uncertainties in atomic data affect spectral line ratios

We argue that the initial spin of the new-born pulsar can be determined by the
orbital period at the time when the second supernova occurs. The spin angular
momentum of the progenitor is expected to be similar to that of the He-burning
core, which is tidally synchronized with the orbital motion, and then the

the large-scale structure inferred from late-time probes pose a serious
challenge to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. State-of-the-art
data from the Planck satellite predicts a higher rate of structure growth than
what preferred by low-redshift observables. Such tension has hitherto eluded
conclusive explanations in terms of straightforward modifications to
$\Lambda$CDM, e.g. the inclusion of massive neutrinos or a dynamical dark
energy component. Here, we investigate models of 'quartessence' -- a single
dark component mimicking both dark matter and dark energy -- whose
non-vanishing sound speed inhibits structure growth at late times on scales
smaller than its corresponding Jeans' length. In principle, this could
reconcile high- and low-redshift observations. We put this hypothesis to test
against temperature and polarisation spectra from the latest Planck release,
SDSS DR12 measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space
distortions, and cosmic shear correlation functions from KiDS. This the first
time that any specific model of quartessence is applied to actual data. We show
that, if we naively apply $\Lambda$CDM nonlinear prescription to quartessence,
the combined data sets allow for tight constraints on the model parameters.
Apparently, quartessence alleviates the tension between the total matter
fraction and late-time structure clustering, although in fact the tension is
transferred from the latter to the quartessence sound speed parameter. However,
we found that this strongly depends upon information from nonlinear scales.
Indeed, if we relax this assumption, quartessence models appear still viable.
For this reason, we argue that the nonlinear behaviour of quartessence deserves
further investigation and may lead to a deeper understanding of the physics of
the dark Universe.

depends on both the clump column density and on the movement of the clumps. We
estimate this threshold analytically and compare our findings to radiative

observed Ly$\alpha$ spectra using homogeneous ""shell models"" (and the
corresponding failure of multiphase models) hints towards the presence of very
small-scale structure in neutral gas, in agreement within a number of other

estimating the mass of the Milky Way and for inferring its formation history.
Since the stellar halo is a dynamically hot system, the velocity distribution
of halo stars is well described by the 3-dimensional velocity dispersions
$(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$, or by the velocity anisotropy
parameter $\beta=1-(\sigma_\theta^2+\sigma_\phi^2)/(2\sigma_r^2)$. Direct
measurements of $(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$ consistently suggest
$\beta =0.5$-$0.7$ for nearby halo stars. In contrast, the value of $\beta$ at
large Galactocentric radius $r$ is still controversial, since reliable proper
motion data are available for only a handful of stars. In the last decade,
several authors have tried to estimate $\beta$ for distant halo stars by
fitting the observed line-of-sight velocities at each radius with simple
velocity distribution models (local fitting methods). Some results of local
fitting methods imply $\beta<0$ at $r \gtrsim 20 \;\rm{kpc}$, which is
inconsistent with recent predictions from cosmological simulations. Here we
perform mock-catalogue analyses to show that the estimates of $\beta$ based on
local fitting methods are reliable only at $r \leq 15 \;\rm{kpc}$ with the
current sample size ($\sim10^3$ stars at a given radius). As $r$ increases, the
line-of-sight velocity (corrected for the Solar reflex motion) becomes
increasingly closer to the Galactocentric radial velocity, so that it becomes
increasingly more difficult to estimate tangential velocity dispersion
$(\sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$ from line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our
results suggest that the forthcoming Gaia data will be crucial for
understanding the velocity distribution of halo stars at $r \geq 20\;\rm{kpc}$.

vastly crude, scaling unfavorable with the system size. Nevertheless, empirical
and numerical evidence suggests that for generic interacting many-body systems,
generic local observables, and sufficiently well-behaved states, the
equilibration time does not depend strongly on the system size, but only the
precision with which this occurs does. In this discussion paper, we aim at
giving very simple and plausible arguments for why this happens. While our
discussion does not yield rigorous results about equilibration time scales, we
believe that it helps to clarify the essential underlying mechanisms, the
intuition and important figure of merits behind equilibration. We then connect
our arguments to common assumptions and numerical results in the field of
equilibration and thermalization of closed quantum systems, such as the

that more problems can be solved given more time. The extent to which a time
hierarchy-type theorem holds in the distributed LOCAL model has been open for
many years. It is consistent with previous results that all natural problems in
the LOCAL model can be classified according to a small constant number of
complexities, such as $O(1),O(\log^* n), O(\log n), 2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$, etc.
  In this paper we establish the first time hierarchy theorem for the LOCAL
model and prove that several gaps exist in the LOCAL time hierarchy.
  1. We define an infinite set of simple coloring problems called Hierarchical
$2\frac{1}{2}$-Coloring}. A correctly colored graph can be confirmed by simply
checking the neighborhood of each vertex, so this problem fits into the class
of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems. However, the complexity of the
$k$-level Hierarchical $2\frac{1}{2}$-Coloring problem is $\Theta(n^{1/k})$,
for $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. The upper and lower bounds hold for both general graphs
and trees, and for both randomized and deterministic algorithms.
  2. Consider any LCL problem on bounded degree trees. We prove an
automatic-speedup theorem that states that any randomized $n^{o(1)}$-time
algorithm solving the LCL can be transformed into a deterministic $O(\log
n)$-time algorithm. Together with a previous result, this establishes that on
trees, there are no natural deterministic complexities in the ranges
$\omega(\log^* n)$---$o(\log n)$ or $\omega(\log n)$---$n^{o(1)}$.
  3. We expose a gap in the randomized time hierarchy on general graphs. Any
randomized algorithm that solves an LCL problem in sublogarithmic time can be
sped up to run in $O(T_{LLL})$ time, which is the complexity of the distributed
Lovasz local lemma problem, currently known to be $\Omega(\log\log n)$ and
$O(\log n)$.

arithmetic operations required to apply this matrix to a generic vector is
bounded above by $2(n-1) \binom{n}{k}$. As a consequence, we show that the
problem of computing all the weights of the irreducible components of a given
function can be solved in $O(n \binom{n}{k})$ operations, improving the
previous bound $O(k^2 \binom{n}{k})$ when $k$ asymptotically dominates
$\sqrt{n}$ in a non-uniform model of computation. The same improvement is
achieved for the problem of computing the isotypic projection onto a single
component.
  The proof is based on the construction of $n-1$ intermediate bases, each one
parametrized by certain pairs composed by a standard Young tableau and a word.
The parametrization of each basis is obtained via the Robinson-Schensted
insertion algorithm.

sedation and analgesia during ventilation, constitutes a major part of the care
of patients admitted to intensive care units. Both prolonged dependence on
mechanical ventilation and premature extubation are associated with increased
risk of complications and higher hospital costs, but clinical opinion on the
best protocol for weaning patients off of a ventilator varies. This work aims
to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information to
predict time-to-extubation readiness and to recommend a personalized regime of
sedation dosage and ventilator support. To this end, we use off-policy
reinforcement learning algorithms to determine the best action at a given
patient state from sub-optimal historical ICU data. We compare treatment
policies from fitted Q-iteration with extremely randomized trees and with
feedforward neural networks, and demonstrate that the policies learnt show
promise in recommending weaning protocols with improved outcomes, in terms of
minimizing rates of reintubation and regulating physiological stability.

processes taking part in a computation is operating correctly or has failed. To
overcome this problem, distributed algorithms are created using unreliable
failure detectors that capture in an abstract way timing assumptions necessary
to assess the operating status of a process. One particular type of failure
detector is a leader election, that indicates a single process that has not
failed. The unreliability of these failure detectors means that they can make
mistakes, however if they are to be used in practice there must be limits to
the eventual behavior of these detectors. These limits are defined as the
quality of service (QoS) provided by the detector. Many works have tackled the
problem of creating failure detectors with predictable QoS, but only for
crash-stop processes and synchronous systems. This paper presents and analyzes
the behavior of a new leader election algorithm named NFD-L for the
asynchronous crash-recovery failure model that is efficient in terms of its use
of stable memory and message exchanges.

that every directed graph may be induced as the pairwise majority relation of
some preference profile. However, this fact requires a number of voters that is
almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard
even when there is only a small constant number of voters. In particular, we
show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous
methods could only establish such a result for constant even numbers of voters.

for a variety of disk masses and inclination angles. We find disk mass-loss
rates that are typically 1e-7 to 1e-6 Msol/yr (but peak near 1e-5 Msol/yr
during the ""instantaneous"" stripping phase) and are sustained for around 200
yr. Inclination angle has little effect on the mass loss unless the disk is
close to edge-on. Inclined disks also strip asymmetrically with the trailing
edge ablating more easily. Since the interaction lasts less than one outer
rotation period, there is not enough time for the disk to restore its symmetry,
leaving the disk asymmetrical after the flow has passed. Of the low-mass disks
considered, only the edge-on disk is able to survive interaction with the SNR
(with 50% of its initial mass remaining). At the end of the simulations, disks
that survive contain fractional masses of SN material up to 5e-6. This is too
low to explain the abundance of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar

the disk to capture a higher fraction of SN material.

find that the Ribbon has evolved differently than the globally distributed flux

solar wind output flattening and recovery. The Ribbon has now also lost its
latitudinal ordering, which reflects the breakdown of solar minimum solar wind

structure in the majority of the others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this
emission appears stationary on a timescale of 4.6 yrs, inconsistent at the
2sigma level with a Keplerian clockwise orbit at 59 au in the disk plane. The H
band spectrum of the emission is inconsistent with any type of low effective
temperature object or accreting protoplanetary disk. It strongly suggests a
scattered light origin, as it is consistent with the spectrum of the star and
the spectra extracted at other locations in the disk. A non detection at the
5sigma level of HD 100546b in differential Halpha imaging places an upper
limit, assuming the protoplanet lies in a gap free of extinction, on the
accretion luminosity and accretion rate of 1.7E-4 Lsun and

from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a Large Program at the Green
Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_V \gtrsim 7$
mag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key
molecular tracers. This first release includes the data for four regions in
Gould Belt clouds: B18 in Taurus, NGC 1333 in Perseus, L1688 in Ophiuchus, and
Orion A North in Orion. We compare the NH$_3$ emission to dust continuum
emission from Herschel, and find that the two tracers correspond closely.
NH$_3$ is present in over 60\% of lines-of-sight with $A_V \gtrsim 7$ mag in
three of the four DR1 regions, in agreement with expectations from previous
observations. The sole exception is B18, where NH$_3$ is detected toward ~ 40\%
of lines-of-sight with $A_V \gtrsim 7$ mag. Moreover, we find that the NH$_3$
emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense
cores. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$ column
densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH$_3$
(1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion,
${\sigma}_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_K$, vary systematically between
the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value
and spread of ${\sigma}_v$ and $T_K$ with increasing star formation activity.
The data presented in this paper are publicly available.

control improvisation. Given a specification language, the problem is to
produce an improviser, a probabilistic algorithm that randomly generates words

quantitative soft constraint, and the exhibition of a specified amount of
randomness. Control improvisation has many applications, including for example
systematically generating random test vectors satisfying format constraints or
preconditions while being similar to a library of seed inputs. Other
applications include robotic surveillance, machine improvisation of music, and
randomized variants of the supervisory control problem. We describe a general
framework for solving the control improvisation problem, and use it to give
efficient algorithms for several practical classes of instances with finite
automaton and context-free grammar specifications. We also provide a detailed
complexity analysis, establishing #P-hardness of the problem in many other
cases. For these intractable cases, we show how symbolic techniques based on
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers can be used to find approximate solutions.
Finally, we discuss an extension of control improvisation to multiple soft
constraints that is useful in some applications.

angular two-point correlation function to study the clustering of these stellar
systems. We find that the spatial distribution of the young clusters and
associations are clustered with respect to each other, forming large, unbound
hierarchical star-forming complexes that are in general very young. The
strength of the clustering decreases with increasing age of the star clusters
and stellar associations, becoming more homogeneously distributed after ~40--60
Myr and on scales larger than a few hundred parsecs. In all galaxies, the
associations exhibit a global behavior that is distinct and more strongly
correlated from compact clusters. Thus, populations of clusters are more
evolved than associations in terms of their spatial distribution, traveling
significantly from their birth site within a few tens of Myr whereas
associations show evidence of disruption occurring very quickly after their
formation. The clustering of the stellar systems resembles that of a turbulent
interstellar medium that drives the star formation process, correlating the
components in unbound star-forming complexes in a hierarchical manner,
dispersing shortly after formation, suggestive of a single, continuous mode of
star formation across all galaxies.

spectacular results for visual object tracking. The types of the features that
are employed in these family of trackers significantly affect the performance
of visual tracking. The ultimate goal is to utilize robust features invariant
to any kind of appearance change of the object, while predicting the object
location as properly as in the case of no appearance change. As the deep
learning based methods have emerged, the study of learning features for
specific tasks has accelerated. For instance, discriminative visual tracking
methods based on deep architectures have been studied with promising
performance. Nevertheless, correlation filter based (CFB) trackers confine
themselves to use the pre-trained networks which are trained for object
classification problem. To this end, in this manuscript the problem of learning
deep fully convolutional features for the CFB visual tracking is formulated. In
order to learn the proposed model, a novel and efficient backpropagation
algorithm is presented based on the loss function of the network. The proposed
learning framework enables the network model to be flexible for a custom
design. Moreover, it alleviates the dependency on the network trained for
classification. Extensive performance analysis shows the efficacy of the
proposed custom design in the CFB tracking framework. By fine-tuning the
convolutional parts of a state-of-the-art network and integrating this model to
a CFB tracker, which is the top performing one of VOT2016, 18% increase is
achieved in terms of expected average overlap, and tracking failures are
decreased by 25%, while maintaining the superiority over the state-of-the-art

methods mostly suffer from lack of efficiency and scalability when dealing with
large-scale and high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new
clustering model, called DEeP Embedded RegularIzed ClusTering (DEPICT), which
efficiently maps data into a discriminative embedding subspace and precisely
predicts cluster assignments. DEPICT generally consists of a multinomial
logistic regression function stacked on top of a multi-layer convolutional
autoencoder. We define a clustering objective function using relative entropy
(KL divergence) minimization, regularized by a prior for the frequency of
cluster assignments. An alternating strategy is then derived to optimize the
objective by updating parameters and estimating cluster assignments.
Furthermore, we employ the reconstruction loss functions in our autoencoder, as
a data-dependent regularization term, to prevent the deep embedding function
from overfitting. In order to benefit from end-to-end optimization and
eliminate the necessity for layer-wise pretraining, we introduce a joint
learning framework to minimize the unified clustering and reconstruction loss
functions together and train all network layers simultaneously. Experimental
results indicate the superiority and faster running time of DEPICT in
real-world clustering tasks, where no labeled data is available for
hyper-parameter tuning.

which the dissipation signal of frequency modulation atomic force microscopy
(FM-AFM) is used for dc bias voltage feedback (D-KPFM). The dissipation arises
from an oscillating electrostatic force that is coherent with the tip
oscillation, which is caused by applying the ac voltage between the tip and
sample. The magnitude of the externally induced dissipation is found to be
proportional to the effective dc bias voltage, which is the difference between
the applied dc voltage and the contact potential difference. Two different
implementations of D-KPFM are presented. In the first implementation, the
frequency of the applied ac voltage, $f_\mathrm{el}$, is chosen to be the same
as the tip oscillation ($f_\mathrm{el} = f_\mathrm{m}$: $1\omega$D-KPFM). In
the second one, the ac voltage frequency, $f_\mathrm{el}$, is chosen to be
twice the tip oscillation frequency ($f_\mathrm{el}= 2 f_\mathrm{m}$:
$2\omega$D-KPFM). In $1\omega$D-KPFM, the dissipation is proportional to the
electrostatic force, which enables the use of a small ac voltage amplitude even
down to $\approx 10$\,mV. In $2\omega$D-KPFM, the dissipation is proportional
to the electrostatic force gradient, which results in the same potential
contrast as that obtained by FM-KPFM. D-KPFM features a simple implementation
with no lock-in amplifier and faster scanning as it requires no low frequency
modulation. The use of a small ac voltage amplitude in $1\omega$D-KPFM is of
great importance in characterizing of technically relevant materials in which
their electrical properties can be disturbed by the applied electric field.
$2\omega$D-KPFM is useful when more accurate potential measurement is required.
The operations in $1\omega$ and $2\omega$D-KPFM can be switched easily to take
advantage of both features at the same location on a sample.

the hydrogen fusion processes embedded in the Standard Solar Model. Finally,
the physics potential of state-of-the-art detectors and a next-generation of

most interesting open questions in solar neutrino physics: a precise

oscillation probability that offers a definitive test of the basic MSW-LMA

being more prone to hardware imperfections, in order to be a cost-efficient

Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) hampered by the inevitable hardware
impairments. We consider a general experimentally validated model of hardware
impairments, accounting for the presence of \textit{multiplicative distortion}
due to phase noise, \textit{additive distortion noise} and \textit{thermal
noise amplification}. Under both scenarios with perfect and imperfect channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we analyze the potential
robustness of RS to each separate hardware imperfection. We analytically assess
the sum-rate degradation due to hardware imperfections. Interestingly, in the
case of imperfect CSIT, we demonstrate that RS is a robust strategy for
multiuser MIMO in the presence of phase and amplified thermal noise, since its
sum-rate does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to
conventional techniques. On the other hand, the additive impairments always
lead to a sum-rate saturation at high SNR, even after the application of RS.
However, RS still enhances the performance. Furthermore, as the number of users
increases, the gains provided by RS decrease not only in ideal conditions, but
in practical conditions with RTHIs as well.

their behavior as a function of proton and neutron numbers contains a large
random component. The benchmarking of the functionals to the experimental data
on fission barriers in the actinides allows to reduce the systematic
theoretical uncertainties for the inner fission barriers of unknown superheavy
elements. However, even then they on average increase on moving away from the

framework that is run to reproduce direct measurements of cosmic ray (CR)
species at different modulation levels and at both polarities of the solar
magnetic field. To do so in a self-consistent way, an iterative procedure was
developed, where the GALPROP LIS output is fed into HelMod that provides
modulated spectra for specific time periods of selected experiments to compare
with the data; the HelMod parameters optimization is performed at this stage
and looped back to adjust the LIS using the new GALPROP run. The parameters
were tuned with the maximum likelihood procedure using an extensive data set of
proton spectra from 1997-2015. The proposed LIS accommodate both the low energy
interstellar CR spectra measured by Voyager 1 and the high energy observations
by BESS, Pamela, AMS-01, and AMS-02 made from the balloons and near-Earth

  am Main",,,,"nucl-ex hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enabled by the addition of a TOF detector system in 2010, the first phase of
the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) at RHIC allows STAR to conduct an unprecedented
energy-dependent study of dielectron production within a homogeneous
experimental environment, and hence close the wide gap in the QCD phase diagram
between SPS and top RHIC energies. This thesis concentrates on the
understanding of the LMR enhancement regarding its $M_{ee}$, $p_{T}$ and energy
dependence. It studies dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at beam
energies of 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV with sufficient statistics. In
conjunction with the published STAR results at top RHIC energy, this thesis
presents results on the first comprehensive energy-dependent study of
dielectron production.
  The comparison of $M_{ee}$- and $p_{T}$-spectra with cocktail simulations of
hadronic sources reveals a sizeable and steadily increasing excess yield in the
LMR at all beam energies. The scenario of broadened in-medium $\rho$ spectral
functions proves to not only serve well as dominating underlying source but
also to be universal in nature since it quantitatively and qualitatively
explains the LMR enhancements from SPS to top RHIC energies. It shows that most
of the enhancement is governed by interactions of the $\rho$ meson with thermal
resonance excitations in the late(r)-stage hot and dense hadronic phase. This
conclusion is supported by the energy-dependent measurement of integrated LMR
excess yields and enhancement factors. The former do not exhibit a strong
dependence on beam energy as expected from the approximately constant total
baryon density above 20 GeV, and the latter show agreement with the CERES
measurement at SPS energy. The consistency in excess yields and agreement with
model calculations over the wide RHIC energy regime makes a strong case for LMR
enhancements on the order of a factor 2-3.

first- and third-person videos that considers both spatial- and motion-domain

correct first- and third-person matches while maximizing the distance between
incorrect ones. This end-to-end approach performs significantly better than
several baselines, in part by learning the first- and third-person features
optimized for matching jointly with the distance measure itself.

pattern with velocity amplitudes reaching $\sim \pm 350$ km s$^{-1}$ in the

redshifts relative to rotation are observed in the nuclear strip, where we also
observe the highest values of the [N II]/H{\alpha}, [S II]/H{\alpha} and [O

observations of NGC 5548, the continuum and emission-line variability became
de-correlated during the second half of the 6-month long observing campaign.
Here we present Swift and Chandra X-ray spectra of NGC 5548 obtained as a part
of the campaign. The Swift spectra show that excess flux (relative to a
power-law continuum) in the soft X-ray band appears before the start of the
anomalous emission-line behavior, peaks during the period of the anomaly, and
then declines. This is a model-independent result suggesting that the soft
excess is related to the anomaly. We divide the Swift data into on- and
off-anomaly spectra to characterize the soft excess via spectral fitting. The
cause of the spectral differences is likely due to a change in the intrinsic
spectrum rather than being due to variable obscuration or partial covering. The
Chandra spectra have lower signal-to-noise ratios, but are consistent with
Swift data. Our preferred model of the soft excess is emission from an
optically thick, warm Comptonizing corona, the effective optical depth of which
increases during the anomaly. This model simultaneously explains all the three
observations: the UV emission line flux decrease, the soft-excess increase, and
the emission line anomaly.

information-centric redesign of the current Internet architecture that makes
content access, dissemination, and storage more efficient. The Named Data
Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) architectures are the
leading examples of such an approach. However, forwarding data by name incurs
storage and communication complexities that are orders of magnitude larger than
solutions based on forwarding data using addresses. Furthermore, the specific
algorithms used in NDN and CCNx have been shown to have a number of
limitations. The Addressable Data Networking (ADN) architecture is introduced
as an alternative to NDN and CCNx. ADN is particularly attractive for
large-scale deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT), because it requires
far less storage and processing in relaying nodes than NDN. ADN allows things
and data to be denoted by names, just like NDN and CCNx do. However, instead of
replacing the waist of the Internet with named-data forwarding, ADN uses an
address-based forwarding plane and introduces an information plane that

Non-detections of CO emission lines and accretion signatures point to the gas

find an outer cold dust belt at ~135K and 20 - 40 AU from the primary, likely
coincident with the disk imaged by Subaru (Currie et al. 2017), and a new
second inner belt with temperature ~570K and an unusual, broad SED maximum in
the 6 - 9 um region, tracing dust at 1.1 - 2.2 AU. An SED maximum at 6 - 9 um
has been reported in just two other A-star systems, HD131488 and HD121191, both
of ~10 Myr age (Melis et al. 2013). From Spitzer, we have also identified the
~12 Myr old A7V HD148567 system as having similar 5 - 35 um excess spectral

emission and rule in carbonaceous materials - organics, carbonates, SiC - as

  Theory","101 pages, Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the
  Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy",,,,"math.CO math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feynman diagrams in $\phi^4$ theory have as their underlying structure
4-regular graphs. In particular, any 4-point $\phi^4$ graph can be uniquely
derived from a 4-regular graph by deleting a vertex. The Feynman period is a
simplified version of the Feynman integral, and is of special interest, as it
maintains much of the important number theoretic information from the Feynman
integral. It is also of structural interest, as it is known to be preserved by
a number of graph theoretic operations. In particular, the vertex deleted in
constructing the 4-point graph does not affect the Feynman period, and it is
invariant under planar duality and the Schnetz twist, an operation that
redirects edges incident to a 4-vertex cut. Further, a 4-regular graph may be
produced by a 3-sum operation on triangles in two 4-regular graphs. The Feynman
period of this graph with a vertex deleted is equal to the product of the
Feynman periods of the two smaller graphs with one vertex deleted each. These
operations currently explain all known instances of non-isomorphic 4-point
$\phi^4$ graphs with equal periods.
  With this in mind, other graph invariants that are preserved by these
operations for 4-point $\phi^4$ graphs are of interest, as they may provide
insight into the Feynman period. In this thesis the extended graph permanent is
introduced; an infinite sequence of residues from prime order finite fields. It
is shown that this sequence is preserved by these three operations, and has a
product property. Additionally, computational techniques will be established,
and an alternate interpretation will be presented as the point count of a novel
graph polynomial.
  Further, the previously existing $c_2$ invariant and Hepp bound are examined,
two graph invariants that are conjectured to be preserved by these graph
operations. A combinatorial approach to the $c_2$ invariant is introduced.

hydration water proton spins having a strong coupling within each pair and a
much weaker coupling with other pairs. We study the experimental response of
attenuation times with temperature, crystal orientation with respect to the
external magnetic field and rf pulse amplitudes. We find that the observed
attenuation of the refocalized signals can be explained by two independent
mechanisms: (a) evolution under the non-secular terms of the reversion
Hamiltonian, and (b) an intrinsic mechanism having the attributes of
irreversible decoherence induced by the coupling with a quantum environment. To
characterize (a) we compare the experimental data with the numerical
calculation of the refocalized NMR signal of an artificial, closed spin system.
To describe (b) we use a model for the irreversible adiabatic decoherence of
spin-pairs coupled with a phonon bath which allows evaluating an upper bound
for the decoherence times. This model accounts for both the observed dependence
of the decoherence times on the eigenvalues of the spin-environment
Hamiltonian, and the independence on the sample temperature. This result, then,
supports the adiabatic decoherence induced by the dipole-phonon coupling as the
explanation for the observed irreversible decay of reverted NMR signals in

sophisticated methods to deal with data fragmentation. We show empirically that
modern weakly supervised data sets are large enough to support naive
partitioning schemes where each data point is assigned to a single expert.
Because the experts are independent, training them in parallel is easy, and
evaluation is cheap for the size of the model. Furthermore, we show that we can
use a single decoding layer for all the experts, allowing a unified feature

painless) to train far larger models than could be practically trained with
standard CNN architectures, and that the extra capacity can be well used on

most indicated routes as it provides the capability of nanometric, serial and
industrial quality fabrication. The maximum amount of quantum information per
unit surface and the consequent space constraints on qubit operations are key
parameters towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing (QIP) with Si
qubits. Such maximum density of quantum information is expressed for the
compact exchange-only Si double quantum dot qubit architecture as a function of
the CMOS technology node. The size scale optimizing both physical qubit
operation time and quantum error correction (QEC) requirements is assessed by
reviewing the physical and technological constraints. We determine the workable
operation frequency range of a Si-CMOS quantum processor to be within 1 and 100

compatibility with classical control circuitry is discussed, focusing on the
cryogenic CMOS operation required to bring the classical controller as close as
possible to the quantum processor and to enable interfacing thousands of qubits
on the same chip. The operation time range prospected for cryogenic control
electronics is found to be compatible with the qubit operation time. By
combining the forecast of technology development with operation time and
classical circuitry constraints, we derive a maximum quantum information

exponents or information about the statistical steady-state, is not possible.
Here we utilize a recently developed framework, the Optimally Time-Dependent

associated with transient features associated with finite-time instabilities.
As the main result, we prove that the OTD modes, under appropriate conditions,
converge exponentially fast to the eigendirections of the Cauchy--Green tensor
associated with the most intense finite-time instabilities. Based on this
observation, we develop a reduced-order method for the computation of

the computational cost of the reduced-order method is orders of magnitude lower

exposure of faces of convex sets. Based on these new notions, we obtain a
necessary condition and a sufficient condition for a cone to be facially dual
complete. In our sufficient condition, we utilize a new notion called
lexicographic tangent cones (these are a family of cones obtained from a
recursive application of the tangent cone concept). Lexicographic tangent cones
are related to Nesterov's lexicographic derivatives and to the notion of
subtransversality in the context of variational analysis.

normalization during training. But we find this is non-trivial, despite
normalization being differentiable. We identify and study four issues related
to normalization through mathematical analysis, which yields understanding and
helps with parameter settings. Based on this analysis we propose two strategies
for training using normalized features. The first is a modification of softmax
loss, which optimizes cosine similarity instead of inner-product. The second is
a reformulation of metric learning by introducing an agent vector for each
class. We show that both strategies, and small variants, consistently improve
performance by between 0.2% to 0.4% on the LFW dataset based on two models.
This is significant because the performance of the two models on LFW dataset is

and tracking system for video surveillance using neural networks which can be
used in dynamic environments. The proposed system consists of two phases:
multi-view pedestrian detection and tracking. First, pedestrian detection
utilizes background subtraction to segment the foreground blob. An adaptive
background subtraction method where each of the pixel of input image models as
a mixture of Gaussians and uses an on-line approximation to update the model
applies to extract the foreground region. The Gaussian distributions are then
evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background
process. This method produces a steady, real-time tracker in outdoor
environment that consistently deals with changes of lighting condition, and
long-term scene change. Second, the Tracking is performed at two phases:
pedestrian classification and tracking the individual subject. A sliding window
is applied on foreground binary image to select an input window which is used
for selecting the input image patches from actually input frame. The neural
networks is used for classification with PHOG features. Finally, a Kalman
filter is applied to calculate the subsequent step for tracking that aims at
finding the exact position of pedestrians in an input image. The experimental
result shows that the proposed approach yields promising performance on
multi-view pedestrian detection and tracking on different benchmark datasets.

landmark of that work managed to evaluate moderately large Boolean circuits by
cascading multiple DNA seesaw gates. Although the design is robust in solution
and scalable, it is designed for one time use and is not reusable. This
prevents pursuing important applications such as feedback and sequential
digital circuits. We present a novel design for DNA nanodevices that can
perform digital logic computations and are furthermore renewable. First, we
modified the prior DNA seesaw gate motif into a hairpin. We call the resulting
motif a DNA hairpin-seesaw gate. We show the feed-forward digital computation

that provides increased scalability to our device. Third, we designed input and
fuel extracting hairpins that when added, initiate a renewing process. This
results in a renewed functional gate, in its original configuration, which is
able to make a new logical computation with new inputs. Finally, we introduced
a renewable two-input Boolean logic OR gate. After calculating the output of a

algorithms, such as Disperse and FilFinder, produce numerous different output
skeletons. The skeletons are a one pixel wide representation of the filamentary
structure in the original input image. However, these output skeletons may not
necessarily be a good representation of that structure. Furthermore, a given
skeleton may not be as good a representation as another. Previously there has
been no mathematical `goodness-of-fit' measure to compare output skeletons to
the input image. Thus far this has been assessed visually, introducing visual
bias. We propose the application of the mean structural similarity index
(MSSIM) as a mathematical goodness-of-fit measure. We describe the use of the
MSSIM to find the output skeletons most mathematically similar to the original
input image (the optimum, or `best', skeletons) for a given algorithm, and
independently of the algorithm. This measure makes possible systematic
parameter studies, aimed at finding the subset of input parameter values
returning optimum skeletons. It can also be applied to the output of
non-skeleton based filament identification algorithms, such as the Hessian
matrix method. The MSSIM removes the need to visually examine thousands of
output skeletons, and eliminates the visual bias, subjectivity, and limited
reproducibility inherent in that process, representing a major improvement on
existing techniques. Importantly, it also allows further automation in the
post-processing of output skeletons, which is crucial in this era of `big
data'.

maintained during occlusions between multiple objects or when objects re-enter

performance of multi-object tracking of different types of objects, a
straightforward comparison of tracking system performance using the standard
Multi Object Tracking (MOT) framework, and classification performance using the
Neovision2 metrics. These data have been hosted publically.

model to roughly delineate the organs of interest in the first stage (seeing
$\sim$40% of the voxels within a simple, automatically generated binary mask of
the patient's body). We then use these predictions of the first-stage FCN to
define a candidate region that will be used to train a second FCN. This step
reduces the number of voxels the FCN has to classify to $\sim$10% while
maintaining a recall high of $>$99%. This second-stage FCN can now focus on
more detailed segmentation of the organs. We respectively utilize training and
validation sets consisting of 281 and 50 clinical CT images. Our hierarchical
approach provides an improved Dice score of 7.5 percentage points per organ on

  problem?","4 two-column pages, no figures. Added references",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new solution to the strong CP problem with distinct experimental signatures
at the LHC is proposed. It is based on the Yukawa interactions between mirror
quarks, Standard Model (SM) quarks and Higgs singlets. (Mirror quarks and
leptons which include non-sterile right-handed neutrinos whose Majorana masses
are proportional to the electroweak scale, form the basis of the EW-$\nu_R$
model.) The aforementioned Yukawa couplings can in general be complex and can
contribute to $Arg\, Det M$ ($\bar{\theta} = \theta_{QCD} + Arg\, Det M$) at
tree-level. The crux of matter in this manuscript is the fact that {\em no
matter how large} the CP-violating phases in the Yukawa couplings might be,
$Arg\, Det M$ can remain small i.e. $\bar{\theta} < 10^{-10}$ for reasonable
values of the Yukawa couplings and, in fact, vanishes when the VEV of the Higgs
singlet (responsible for the Dirac part of the neutrino mass in the seesaw
mechanism) vanishes. The smallness of the contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ is
{\em principally due} to the smallness of the ratio of the two mass scales in
the seesaw mechanism: the Dirac and Majorana mass scales.

selection often introduce a dwell time: a fixed amount of time the user must
fixate upon an object before it is selected. Past interfaces have used a
uniform dwell time across all objects. Here, we propose a gaze-based browser
using a two-step selection policy with variable dwell time. In the first step,
a command, e.g. ""back"" or ""select"", is chosen from a menu using a dwell time
that is constant across the different commands. In the second step, if the
""select"" command is chosen, the user selects a hyperlink using a dwell time
that varies between different hyperlinks. We assign shorter dwell times to more
likely hyperlinks and longer dwell times to less likely hyperlinks. In order to
infer the likelihood each hyperlink will be selected, we have developed a
probabilistic model of natural gaze behavior while surfing the web. We have
evaluated a number of heuristic and probabilistic methods for varying the dwell
times using both simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that
varying dwell time improves the user experience in comparison with fixed dwell
time, resulting in fewer errors and increased speed. While all of the methods
for varying dwell time resulted in improved performance, the probabilistic
models yielded much greater gains than the simple heuristics. The best
performing model reduces error rate by 50% compared to 100ms uniform dwell time
while maintaining a similar response time. It reduces response time by 60%

We therefore study the mean and variance of the number of k-hop paths between

graph where nodes connect probabilistically rather than deterministically

fading is modelled, the variance of the number of three hop paths is in fact
composed of four separate decaying exponentials, one of which is the mean,
which decays slowest as the Euclidean distance between the endpoints goes to
infinity. These terms each correspond to one of exactly four distinct
sub-structures with can form when pairs of paths intersect in a specific way,
for example at exactly one node. Using a sum of factorial moments, this relates
to the path existence probability. We also discuss a potential application of
our results in bounding the broadcast time.

especially appealing for fast switching applications in nonvolatile memory and
logic units. So far, however, the timescale and evolution of the magnetization
during the switching process have remained undetected. Here, we report the
direct observation of SOT-driven magnetization dynamics in Pt/Co/AlO$_x$ dots

and 100 ps temporal resolution reveal that switching is achieved within the
duration of a sub-ns current pulse by the fast nucleation of an inverted domain
at the edge of the dot and propagation of a tilted domain wall across the dot.
The nucleation point is deterministic and alternates between the four dot
quadrants depending on the sign of the magnetization, current, and external

concerted action of both damping-like and field-like SOT and show that
reproducible switching events can be obtained for over $10^{12}$ reversal

Poincare section method for comparing the influence of different birth velocity
distributions. The inspection of the maximal asymptotic Lyapunov (Lambda)
exponent shows that the dynamical behaviors of the selected orbits are nearly
the same as the regular orbits with two degrees of freedom, both in
axisymmetric and triaxial when (phi, q_z)= (0,0). Conversely, a few chaotic
trajectories are found with a rotated triaxial halo when (phi, q_z)= (90, 1.5).
The tube orbits preserve the direction of their circulation around either the
long or short axis as appeared in the triaxial potential, even when every
initial condition leads to different orientations. The Poincare section method
shows that there are 2-D invariant tori and invariant curves (islands) around
stable periodic orbits that bound to the surface of 3-D tori. The regularity of
the several prototypical orbits offer the means to identify the phase space
regions with localized motions and to determine their environment in different
models, because they can occupy significant parts of phase-space depending on
the potential. This is of particular importance in Galactic Dynamics.

image classifier that is based on a shallow convolutional neural network

that by transferring the use of prior knowledge from the detection and tracking

adaptively learns the shape and motion of tracked objects, and apply it to the

exhaustive classification, we examine the space group symmetries of all 49
layer groups lacking inversion taking into account spin-orbit coupling.
Although a direct transition between two insulators is generally predicted to
occur when a band crossing happens at a general point in the Brillouin zone, we
find that a variety of stable semimetal phases with point or line nodes can
also arise due to the band crossing in the presence of additional crystalline
symmetries. Through our theoretical study, we provide, for the first time, the
complete list of nodal semimetals created by a band inversion in
two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric systems with time-reversal invariance. The
transition from an insulator to a nodal semimetal can be grouped into three
classes depending on the crystalline symmetry. Firstly, in systems with a
two-fold rotation about the z-axis (normal to the system), a band inversion at
a generic point generates a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal with point nodes.
Secondly, when the band crossing happens on the line invariant under a two-fold
rotation (mirror) symmetry with the rotation (normal) axis lying in the
two-dimensional plane, a Weyl semimetal with point nodes can also be obtained.
Finally, when the system has a mirror symmetry about the plane embracing the
whole system, a semimetal with nodal lines can be created. Applying our
theoretical framework, we identify various two-dimensional materials as
candidate systems in which stable nodal semimetal phases can be induced via
doping, applying electric field, or strain-engineering, etc.

a plethora of ideas, but 30 years after its discovery in cuprates, very few
have achieved convincing experimental validation. While Hubbard and t-J models
were given a lot of attention, a number of recent experiments appear to give
decisive support to the model of real-space inter-site pairing and percolative
superconductivity in cuprates. Systematic measurements of the doping dependence
of the superfluid density show a linear dependence on superfluid density -
rather than doping - over the entire phase diagram, in accordance with the
model's predictions. The doping-dependence of the anomalous lattice dynamics of
in-plane Cu-O mode vibrations observed by inelastic neutron scattering, gives
remarkable reciprocal space signature of the inter-site pairing interaction
whose doping dependence closely follows the predicted pair density.
Symmetry-specific time-domain spectroscopy shows carrier localization, polaron
formation, pairing and superconductivity to be distinct processes occurring on
distinct timescales throughout the entire superconducting phase diagram. The
three diverse experimental results confirm non-trivial predictions made more
than a decade ago by the inter-site pairing model in the cuprates, remarkably
also confirming some of the fundamental notions mentioned in the seminal paper
on the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.

manifold-valued data. While the task of denoising has been extensively studied
in the last years, there was rarely an attempt to perform image inpainting on
manifold-valued data. In this paper we present a nonlocal inpainting method for
manifold-valued data given on a finite weighted graph. We introduce a new graph
infinity-Laplace operator based on the idea of discrete minimizing Lipschitz
extensions, which we use to formulate the inpainting problem as PDE on the
graph. Furthermore, we derive an explicit numerical solving scheme, which we
evaluate on two classes of synthetic manifold-valued images.

experimental precision at Fermilab and at J-PARC propel further reduction of
the theoretical uncertainty of $a_{\mu}$. The hope is that the efforts on both

range (< 1 neV to >10 $\mu$eV) using gates placed adjacent to the stripes. For
both types, we numerically compute the local density of states for two parallel
Majorana-stripe ends as well as Majorana trijunctions formed in a tuning-fork
geometry. The MBS coupling between parallel Majorana stripes can be suppressed
below 1 neV for potential barriers in the meV range for separations of about
200 nm. We further show that the MBS couplings in a trijunction can be
gate-controlled in a range similar to the intra-stripe coupling while
maintaining a sizable gap to the excited states (tens of $\mu$eV). Altogether,
this suggests that braiding can carried out on a time scale of 10-100 ns.

crisis triggered by extreme inequality, attempting to stick to most possibly
intrinsic assumptions. Our general framework is that of pure or modified
multiplicative processes, basically geometric Brownian motions. In contrast
with the usual approach of injecting into such stochastic agent models either
specific, idiosyncratic internal nonlinear interaction patterns, or macroscopic
disruptive features, we propose a dynamic inequality model where the attainment
of a sizable fraction of the total wealth by very few agents induces a crisis
regime with strong intermittency, the explicit coupling between the richest and
the rest being a mere normalization mechanism, hence with minimal extrinsic
assumptions. The model thus harnesses the recognized lack of ergodicity of
geometric Brownian motions. It also provides a statistical intuition to the
consequences of Thomas Piketty's recent ""$r>g$"" (return rate $>$ growth rate)
paradigmatic analysis of very-long-term wealth trends. We suggest that the
""water-divide"" of wealth flow may define effective classes, making an objective
entry point to calibrate the model. Consistently, we check that a tax mechanism
associated to a few percent relative bias on elementary daily transactions is
able to slow or stop the build-up of large wealth. When extreme fluctuations
are tamed down to a stationary regime with sizable but steadier inequalities,
it should still offer opportunities to study the dynamics of crisis and the
inner effective classes induced through external or internal factors.

shortest queue, or one of the two with equal probability if their lengths are
equal. The arrival process is Poisson, service times at each queue have
exponential distributions with the same parameter, and both queues have equal
capacity. Using standard generating function arguments, a simple expression for
the blocking probability is derived, which as far as we know is original. Using
coupling arguments and explicit formulas, comparisons with related loss systems
are then provided. Bounds are similarly obtained for the average total number
of customers, with the stationary distribution explicitly determined on $\{K,
\dots, 2K \}$, and elsewhere upper bounded. Furthermore, from the balance
equations, all stationary probabilities are obtained as explicit combinations
of their values at states $(0,k)$ for $0 \le k \le K$. These expressions extend
to the infinite capacity and asymmetric cases, i.e., when the queues have
different service rates. For the initial symmetric finite capacity model, the
stationary probabilities of states $(0,k)$ can be obtained recursively from the
blocking probability. In the other cases, they are implicitly determined
through a functional equation that characterizes their generating function. The
whole approach shows that the stationary distribution of the infinite capacity
symmetric process is the limit of the corresponding finite capacity
distributions. For the infinite capacity symmetric model, we provide an
elementary proof of a result by Cohen which gives the solution of the
functional equation in terms of an infinite product with explicit zeroes and

tremendous challenges on the decoding process due to chromatic distortion,

further discover a new type of chromatic distortion in high-density color QR
codes, cross-module color interference, caused by the high density which also
makes the geometric distortion correction more challenging. To address these
problems, we propose two approaches, namely, LSVM-CMI and QDA-CMI, which
jointly model these different types of chromatic distortion. Extended from SVM

the decoding performance for mobile applications. We put forth and implement a

HiQ. To evaluate the performance of HiQ, we collect a challenging large-scale
color QR code dataset, CUHK-CQRC, which consists of 5390 high-density color QR

hypothesize that cloud evolution can be better characterized by the evolution
of the (column) density distribution function and the relative power of dense

presence of star-forming activity. Based on the small analyzed sample, we
propose four evolutionary stages, namely: {\it cloud integration, stellar

integration} stage and the final {\it dispersed cloud} stage may be
distinguished from the two intermediate stages by a steeper than $-$4 power-law

stellar assembly} stage are further distinguished from each other by the larger
luminosity-to-mass ratio ($>$40 $\rm L_{\odot}/M_{\odot}$) of the latter.

quantity. The one proposed here relies on adiffusion-advection heat transfer
model. Advection is generally not considered in such problems but due to
plastic instabilities, a heterogeneous and non-negligible velocity field can
play a role in the local heat transfer balance. Discretization of the governing

is then achieved through regular modal truncation. The objective of the
inversion process lies in a proper identification of the decomposition

Karhunen-Loeve Decomposition (KLD) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on

the velocity dependence of lags, and the change of lags with time. We propose
that changes on timescales longer than the light-crossing time do not come from
dynamical changes in the BLR, but are a natural result of the effect of
outflowing dusty clumps driven by radiation pressure acting on the dust. The
motion of these clumps offers an explanation of long-term changes in
polarization. The effects of the dust complicate the study of the structure and
kinematics of the BLR and the search for sub-parsec SMBH binaries. Partial

techniques to analyze such relations from visual data bears great potential to
build machines that better understand us and are capable of interacting with us

overwhelming diversity and complexity of the topic and consequently have only
focused on a handful of social relations. In this paper, we argue that the
domain-based theory from social psychology is a great starting point to
systematically approach this problem. The theory provides coverage of all
aspects of social relations and equally is concrete and predictive about the
visual attributes and behaviors defining the relations included in each domain.
We provide the first dataset built on this holistic conceptualization of social
life that is composed of a hierarchical label space of social domains and
social relations. We also contribute the first models to recognize such domains
and relations and find superior performance for attribute based features.
Beyond the encouraging performance of the attribute based approach, we also
find interpretable features that are in accordance with the predictions from
social psychology literature. Beyond our findings, we believe that our
contributions more tightly interleave visual recognition and social psychology
theory that has the potential to complement the theoretical work in the area
with empirical and data-driven models of social life.

respect to the nominal value. For planets trapped in the 2:1 commensurability,
offsets may reach values on the order of $0.1$ for orbital periods on the order
of $1$ day, while systems in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance (MMR) show much
smaller offsets for all values of the semimajor axis. These properties are in
good agreement with the observed distribution of near-resonant exoplanets,
independent of their detection method. We show that 2:1-resonant systems far
from the star, such as HD82943 and HR8799, are characterized by very small
resonant offsets, while higher values are typical of systems discovered by
Kepler with orbital periods approximately a few days. Conversely, planetary
systems in the vicinity of the 3:2 MMR show little offset with no significant
dependence on the orbital distance. In conclusion, our results indicate that
the distribution of Kepler planetary systems around the 2:1 and 3:2 MMR are
consistent with resonant configurations obtained as a consequence of a smooth

high-resolution CFHT spectrum (R=120 000, S/R=400). The synthetic spectra are
computed with four different line lists, using in parallel 3D hydrodynamical
CO5BOLD and 1D LHD model atmospheres and treating the line formation of the
lithium components in non-LTE (NLTE). We find A(Li)=1.69+/-0.11 dex and
6Li/7Li=8.0+/-4.4 % in 3D-NLTE, using the line list of Mel\'endez et al.
(2012), updated with new atomic data for V I, which results in the best fit of
the lithium line profile of HD123351. Two other line lists lead to similar
results but with inferior fit qualities. Our 2-sigma detection of the 6Li
isotope is the result of a careful statistical analysis and the visual
inspection of each achieved fit. Since the presence of a significant amount of
6Li in the atmosphere of a cool evolved star is not expected in the framework
of standard stellar evolution theory, non-standard, external lithium production
mechanisms, possibly related to stellar activity or a recent accretion of rocky

which a real-valued time series of N data is mapped into a graph of N nodes.
This graph has been shown to often inherit in its topology non-trivial
properties of the series structure, and can thus be seen as a combinatorial
representation of a dynamical system. Here we explore in some detail the
relation between visibility graphs and symbolic dynamics. To do that, we
consider the degree sequence of horizontal visibility graphs generated by the
one-parameter logistic map, for a range of values of the parameter for which
the map shows chaotic behaviour. Numerically, we observe that in the chaotic
region the block entropies of these sequences systematically converge to the
Lyapunov exponent of the system. Via Pesin identity, this in turn suggests that
these block entropies are converging to the Kolmogorov- Sinai entropy of the
map, which ultimately suggests that the algorithm is implicitly and adaptively
constructing phase space partitions which might have the generating property.
To give analytical insight, we explore the relation k(x), x \in[0,1] that, for
a given datum with value x, assigns in graph space a node with degree k. In the
case of the out-degree sequence, such relation is indeed a piece-wise constant
function. By making use of explicit methods and tools from symbolic dynamics we
are able to analytically show that the algorithm indeed performs an effective
partition of the phase space and that such partition is naturally expressed as
a countable union of subintervals, where the endpoints of each subinterval are
related to the fixed point structure of the iterates of the map and the
subinterval enumeration is associated with particular ordering structures that
we called motifs.

computer models of the Earth system are developed and applied. These models
hardly represent dynamical properties of technological processes despite their
great planetary-scale influence on the biogeophysical components of the Earth
system and the associated risks for human societies posed, e.g., by climatic
change or novel entities. In this contribution, we reflect on the technosphere
from the perspective of Earth system analysis with a threefold focus on agency,
networks and complex coevolutionary dynamics. First, we argue that Haff's
conception of the technosphere takes an extreme position in implying a strongly
constrained human agency in the Earth system. Assuming that the technosphere
develops according to dynamics largely independently of human intentions,
Haff's perspective appears incompatible with a humanistic view that underlies
the sustainability discourse at large and, more specifically, current
frameworks such as UN sustainable development goals and the safe and just
operating space for humanity. Second, as an alternative to Haff's static
three-stratum picture, we propose complex adaptive networks as a concept for
describing the interplay of social agents and technospheric entities and their
emergent dynamics for Earth system analysis. Third, we argue that following a
coevolutionary approach in conceptualising and modelling technospheric
dynamics, also including the socio-cultural and biophysical spheres of the
Earth system, could resolve the apparent conflict between the discourses on
sustainability and the technosphere.

out of the galactic interstellar medium. We model the clouds - identified from
the SILCC simulations - with a resolution of up to 0.06 pc using adaptive mesh
refinement in combination with a chemical network to follow heating, cooling,
and the formation of H$_2$ and CO including (self-) shielding. The two clouds
are assembled within a few million years with mass growth rates of up to $\sim$
10$^{-2}$ M$_\mathrm{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ and final masses of $\sim$ 50 000
M$_\mathrm{sun}$. A spatial resolution of $\lesssim$ 0.1 pc is required for
convergence with respect to the mass, velocity dispersion, and chemical
abundances of the clouds, although these properties also depend on the cloud
definition such as based on density thresholds, H$_2$ or CO mass fraction. To
avoid grid artefacts, the progressive increase of resolution has to occur
within the free-fall time of the densest structures (1 - 1.5 Myr) and $\gtrsim$
200 time steps should be spent on each refinement level before the resolution
is progressively increased further. This avoids the formation of spurious,
large-scale, rotating clumps from unresolved turbulent flows. While CO is a
good tracer for the evolution of dense gas with number densities $n \geq$ 300
cm$^{-3}$, H$_2$ is also found for $n \lesssim 30$ cm$^{-3}$ due to turbulent
mixing and becomes dominant at column densities around 30 - 50 M$_\mathrm{sun}$
pc$^{-2}$. The CO-to-H$_2$ ratio steadily increases within the first 2 Myr
whereas $X_\mathrm{CO}\simeq$ 1 - 4 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km
s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ is approximately constant since the CO(1-0) line quickly
becomes optically thick.

doping dependent deviation from harmonic behavior for the frequency shift of
the in-phase mode, a smaller amount of anharmonicity for the apex mode, and
almost no effect for the out-of-phase B1g-symmetry phonon. It appears that the
amount of anharmonicity depends strongly on the oxygen concentration; it
diminishes close to the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transition
and close to optimal doping, while it reaches its maximum value for the
ortho-II and a tetragonal phase. The almost zero anharmonicity at optimal
doping persists even at 77K. The data in the overdoped oxygen concentration,
where a softening of the in-phase phonon frequency occurs, indicate that the
anharmonicity is not enhanced by the sudden increase in the CuO2 buckling. The
results fully agree with recent studies of the ortho-II phase but they do not
comply with a static double-well potential of the apical oxygen atom at optimal

characterise the population of galaxy clusters. We provide a description of the
construction of the NORAS II galaxy cluster survey based on X-ray data from the
northern part of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. NORAS II extends the NORAS survey
down to a flux limit of 1.8 x 10^(-12) erg s^-1 cm^-2 (0.1 - 2.4 keV)
increasing the sample size by about a factor of two. The NORAS II cluster
survey now reaches the same quality and depth of its counterpart, the Southern
REFLEX II survey, allowing us to combine the two complementary surveys. The
paper provides information on the determination of the cluster X-ray
parameters, the identification process of the X-ray sources, the statistics of
the survey, and the construction of the survey selection function, which we
provide in numerical format. Currently NORAS II contains 860 clusters with a
median redshift of z = 0.102. We provide a number of statistical functions
including the logN-logS and the X-ray luminosity function and compare these to
the results from the complementary REFLEX II survey. Using the NORAS II sample
to constrain the cosmological parameters, sigma_8 and Omega_m, yields results
perfectly consistent with those of REFLEX II. Overall, the results show that
the two hemisphere samples, NORAS II and REFLEX II, can be combined without
problems to an all-sky sample, just excluding the Zone-of-Avoidance.

from Cochrane reviews for sequence generation, allocation concealment and
blinding and between-trial heterogeneity.
  Study Design and Setting: Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted to binary
data from 117 meta-analyses, to estimate the ratio {\lambda} by which
heterogeneity changes for trials at high/unclear risk of bias, compared to
trials at low risk of bias. We estimated the proportion of between-trial
heterogeneity in each meta-analysis that could be explained by the bias
associated with specific design characteristics.
  Results: Univariable analyses showed that heterogeneity variances were, on
average, increased among trials at high/unclear risk of bias for sequence
generation ({\lambda} 1.14, 95% interval: 0.57 to 2.30) and blinding ({\lambda}
1.74, 95% interval: 0.85 to 3.47). Trials at high/unclear risk of bias for
allocation concealment were on average less heterogeneous ({\lambda} 0.75, 95%
interval: 0.35 to 1.61). Multivariable analyses showed that a median of 37%
(95% interval: 0% to 71%) heterogeneity variance could be explained by trials
at high/unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment
and/or blinding. All 95% intervals for changes in heterogeneity were wide and
included the null of no difference.
  Conclusion: Our interpretation of the results is limited by imprecise
estimates. There is some indication that between-trial heterogeneity could be
partially explained by reported design characteristics, and hence adjustment
for bias could potentially improve accuracy of meta-analysis results.

$\vert{\lambda}\vert=1$ (the ""zero-field"" case). A randomized algorithm (FPRAS)

deterministic approximation algorithms for problems in statistical physics and

Rather, we exploit and extend machinery developed recently by Barvinok, and
Patel and Regts, based on the location of the complex zeros of the partition
function, which can be seen as an algorithmic realization of the classical
Lee-Yang approach to phase transitions. Our approach extends to the more
general setting of the Ising model on hypergraphs of bounded degree and edge
size, where no previous algorithms (even randomized) were known for a wide
range of parameters. In order to achieve this extension, we establish a tight
version of the Lee-Yang theorem for the Ising model on hypergraphs, improving a
classical result of Suzuki and Fisher.

intelligent tutoring systems or social network analysis. In many cases, such
models need to take changes in the graph structure into account, i.e. a varying
number of nodes or edges. Predicting such changes within graphs can be expected
to yield important insight with respect to the underlying dynamics, e.g. with
respect to user behaviour. However, predictive techniques in the past have
almost exclusively focused on single edges or nodes. In this contribution, we
attempt to predict the future state of a graph as a whole. We propose to phrase
time series prediction as a regression problem and apply dissimilarity- or
kernel-based regression techniques, such as 1-nearest neighbor, kernel
regression and Gaussian process regression, which can be applied to graphs via
graph kernels. The output of the regression is a point embedded in a
pseudo-Euclidean space, which can be analyzed using subsequent dissimilarity-
or kernel-based processing methods. We discuss strategies to speed up Gaussian
Processes regression from cubic to linear time and evaluate our approach on two
well-established theoretical models of graph evolution as well as two real data
sets from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems. We find that simple
regression methods, such as kernel regression, are sufficient to capture the
dynamics in the theoretical models, but that Gaussian process regression
significantly improves the prediction error for real-world data.

scheme can reduce channel acquisition overhead by replacing pilot-aided channel

which are deterministic and approximately universal. The resource states which
play the role of graph states are prepared via 2-qubit gates of the form
$\exp(-i\frac{\pi}{2^{n}} Z\otimes Z)$. When $n = 2$, these are equivalent, up
to local Clifford unitaries, to graph states. However, when $n > 2$, their
behaviour diverges in two important ways. First, multiple applications of the
entangling gate to a single pair of qubits produces non-trivial entanglement,
and hence multiple parallel edges between nodes play an important role in these
generalised graph states. Second, such a state can be used to realise
deterministic, approximately universal computation using only Pauli $Z$ and $X$
measurements and feed-forward. Even though, for $n > 2$, the relevant resource
states are no longer stabiliser states, they admit a straightforward, graphical
representation using the ZX-calculus. Using this representation, we are able to
provide a simple, graphical proof of universality. We furthermore show that for

respect to the distance to the city centre for the European city. In addition
to providing the radial population density and soil-sealing profiles for a
large set of cities, we demonstrate a remarkable constancy of the profiles
across city size.
  Our analysis combines the GMES/Copernicus Urban Atlas 2006 land use database
at 5m resolution for 300 European cities with more than 100.000 inhabitants and
the Geostat population grid at 1km resolution. Population is allocated
proportionally to surface and weighted by soil sealing and density classes of
the Urban Atlas. We analyse the profile of each artificial land use and
population with distance to the town hall.
  In line with earlier literature, we confirm the strong monocentricity of the
European city and the negative exponential curve for population density.
Moreover, we find that land use curves, in particular the share of housing and
roads, scale along the two horizontal dimensions with the square root of city
population, while population curves scale in three dimensions with the cubic
root of city population. In short, European cities of different sizes are
homothetic in terms of land use and population density. While earlier
literature documented the scaling of average densities (total surface and
population) with city size, we document the scaling of the whole radial
distance profile with city size, thus liaising intra-urban radial analysis and
systems of cities. In addition to providing a new empirical view of the
European city, our scaling offers a set of practical and coherent definitions
of a city, independent of its population, from which we can re-question urban
scaling laws and Zipf's law for cities.

presence of a polar field in LaAlO3 and the insurgence of point defects, such
as oxygen vacancies and intermixed cations. These defects usually reside in the
conduction channel and are responsible for a decreased electronic mobility. In
this work we use an amorphous WO3 overlayer to control the defect formation and
obtain an increased electron mobility and effective mass in WO3/LaAlO3/SrTiO3
heterostructures. The studied system shows a sharp insulator-to-metal
transition as a function of both LaAlO3 and WO3 layer thickness.
Low-temperature magnetotransport reveals a strong magnetoresistance reaching
900% at 10 T and 1.5 K, the presence of multiple conduction channels with
carrier mobility up to 80 000 cm2/Vs and an unusually high effective mass of
5.6 me. The amorphous character of the WO3 overlayer makes this a versatile
approach for defect control at oxide interfaces, which could be applied to
other heterestrostures disregarding the constraints imposed by crystal

Metric-Affine formalism as a framework in which study extensions of GR. I
review its features and motivate it through its application in Bravais
crystals, where ideal crystals can be described through Riemannian formalism,
but a crystal with defects have to be described with in terms of an independent
connection. The simplest way to construct solutions different from GR in this
formalism is to take a quadratic gravity lagrangian with an electrovacuum
stress-energy tensor. This way, charged black hole solutions are obtained.
  The geometry of these new charged black hole solutions is analysed. Far from
the sources, the geometry of these new solutions is equal to the GR one up to
$1/r^4$ corrections. However, instead of a central singularity, they have a
wormhole structure, which can be completely regular or where the curvature
scalars diverge, depending on the mass and charge of the black hole. I study
the geodesics around the wormhole throat and conclude that the geodesics are
always complete even in the case of a curvature divergence. To analyse in more
detail the geometry, I also study the evolution of a scalar wave sent towards
the wormhole. The evolution is shown to be regular and I calculate the
transmission coefficients and transmission cross section for a naked wormhole.
  Finally, I study the same case for a Born-Infeld lagrangian in an arbitrary
number of dimension ($d>4$). In this setting, the wormhole structure is also
present and the geodesics are still complete, therefore showing that the
metric-affine formalism can resolve singularities for a variety of models, and
is not a particular feature of the quadratic Lagrangian for $d=4$.

the results, we further study the asymptotic performance of the precoders when
both the peak-to-average power ratio and number of active transmit antennas are

investigate dark-matter halo mass (Mh) of the z~4-7 LBGs and its correlation
with various physical properties including the star-formation rate (SFR), the
stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR), and the dark matter accretion rate (dotMh)
over a wide-mass range of Mh/M$_\odot$=4x10^10-4x10^12. We find that the SHMR
increases from z~4 to 7 by a factor of ~4 at Mh~1x10^11 M$_\odot$, while the
SHMR shows no strong evolution in the similar redshift range at Mh~1x10^12
M$_\odot$. Interestingly, we identify a tight relation of SFR/dotMh-Mh showing
no significant evolution beyond 0.15 dex in this wide-mass range over z~4-7.
This weak evolution suggests that the SFR/dotMh-Mh relation is a fundamental
relation in high-redshift galaxy formation whose star formation activities are
regulated by the dark matter mass assembly. Assuming this fundamental relation,
we calculate the cosmic SFR densities (SFRDs) over z=0-10 (a.k.a. Madau-Lilly
plot). The cosmic SFRD evolution based on the fundamental relation agrees with
the one obtained by observations, suggesting that the cosmic SFRD increase from
z~10 to 4-2 (decrease from z~4-2 to 0) is mainly driven by the increase of the
halo abundance (the decrease of the accretion rate).

  We show that by employing a CNN accurate estimations of esophagus location
can be obtained and refined by a post processing RW step. One of the main
advantages compared to previous methods is that our network performs
convolutions in a 3D manner, fully exploiting the 3D spatial context and
performing an efficient and precise volume-wise prediction. The whole
segmentation process is fully automatic and yields esophagus delineations in
very good agreement with the used gold standard, showing that it can compete

by fitting the corresponding SNM properties at sub-saturation density to the

function of a hyperelastic material from full knowledge of the displacement
field as well as from surface sensor measurements. The displacement field is
represented as a solution of Cauchy's equation of motion, which is a nonlinear,
elastic wave equation. Hyperelasticity means that the first Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor is given as the gradient of the stored energy function. We assume
that a dictionary of suitable functions is available and the aim is to recover
the stored energy with respect to this dictionary. The considered inverse
problem is of vital interest for the development of structural health
monitoring systems which are constructed to detect defects in elastic materials
from boundary measurements of the displacement field, since the stored energy
encodes the mechanical peroperties of the underlying structure. In this article
we develope a numerical solver for both settings using the attenuated Landweber
method. We show that the parameter-to-solution map satisfies the local
tangential cone condition. This result can be used to prove local convergence
of the attenuated Landweber method in case that the full displacement field is
measured. In our numerical experiments we demonstrate how to construct an

interacting particle process with drift, that generalizes the one-dimensional
Hammersley process [Aldous and Diaconis 1995, Seppalainen 1996], or as an
irreversible dynamics of lozenge tilings of the plane [Borodin and Ferrari

height profile converges, after a hyperbolic scaling of space and time, to the
solution of a non-linear first order PDE of Hamilton-Jacobi type with
non-convex Hamiltonian (non-convexity of the Hamiltonian is a distinguishing
feature of the AKPZ class). We prove the result in two situations: (i) for
smooth initial profiles and times smaller than the time $T_{shock}$ when
singularities (shocks) appear or (ii) for all times, including $t>T_{shock}$,
if the initial profile is convex. In the latter case, the height profile
converges to the viscosity solution of the PDE. As an important ingredient, we
introduce a Harris-type graphical construction for the process.

structures of dust is a challenging problem due to the anisotropic scattering
of dust grains and strong coupling between different spatial regions. The
radiative transfer problem in 3D is solved using Monte Carlo or Ray Tracing
techniques as no full analytic solution exists for the true 3D structures. We
provide the first 3D dust radiative transfer benchmark composed of a slab of
dust with uniform density externally illuminated by a star. This simple 3D
benchmark is explicitly formulated to provide tests of the different components
of the radiative transfer problem including dust absorption, scattering, and
emission. This benchmark includes models with a range of dust optical depths
fully probing cases that are optically thin at all wavelengths to optically
thick at most wavelengths. This benchmark includes solutions for the full dust
emission including single photon (stochastic) heating as well as two
simplifying approximations: One where all grains are considered in equilibrium
with the radiation field and one where the emission is from a single effective
grain with size-distribution-averaged properties. A total of six Monte Carlo
codes and one Ray Tracing code provide solutions to this benchmark. Comparison
of the results revealed that the global SEDs are consistent on average to a few
percent for all but the scattered stellar flux at very high optical depths. The
image results are consistent within 10%, again except for the stellar scattered
flux at very high optical depths. The lack of agreement between different codes
of the scattered flux at high optical depths is quantified for the first time.
We provide the first 3D dust radiative transfer benchmark and validate the
accuracy of this benchmark through comparisons between multiple independent

the local shear gradient. This surprising, flow-dependent migration is
characterized by simulations and analytical calculations for small particle

of this equation have focused on perturbations of equilibrium-stationary or
self-similar profiles, the latter eventually wetting the whole surface. These
solutions have their counterparts for the second-order porous-medium equation
$h_t - (h^m)_{yy} = 0$, where $m > 1$ is a free parameter. Both porous-medium
and thin-film equation degenerate as $h \searrow 0$, but the porous-medium
equation additionally fulfills a comparison principle while the thin-film
equation does not.
  In this note, we consider traveling waves $h = \frac V 6 x^3 + \nu x^2$ for
$x \ge 0$, where $x = y-V t$ and $V, \nu \ge 0$ are free parameters. These
traveling waves are receding and therefore describe de-wetting, a phenomenon
genuinely linked to the fourth-order nature of the thin-film equation and not
encountered in the porous-medium case as it violates the comparison principle.
The linear stability analysis leads to a linear fourth-order
degenerate-parabolic operator for which we prove maximal-regularity estimates
to arbitrary orders of the expansion in $x$ in a right-neighborhood of the
contact line $x = 0$. This leads to a well-posedness and stability result for
the corresponding nonlinear equation. As the linearized evolution has different
scaling as $x \searrow 0$ and $x \to \infty$, the analysis is more intricate
than in related previous works. We anticipate that our approach is a natural
step towards investigating other situations in which the comparison principle
is violated, such as droplet rupture.

days of computer vision. To estimate the viewpoint (or pose) of an object,
people have mostly looked at object intrinsic features, such as shape or
appearance. Surprisingly, informative features provided by other, extrinsic
elements in the scene, have so far mostly been ignored. At the same time,
contextual cues have been proven to be of great benefit for related tasks such
as object detection or action recognition. In this paper, we explore how
information from other objects in the scene can be exploited for viewpoint
estimation. In particular, we look at object configurations by following a
relational neighbor-based approach for reasoning about object relations. We
show that, starting from noisy object detections and viewpoint estimates,
exploiting the estimated viewpoint and location of other objects in the scene
can lead to improved object viewpoint predictions. Experiments on the KITTI
dataset demonstrate that object configurations can indeed be used as a
complementary cue to appearance-based viewpoint estimation. Our analysis
reveals that the proposed context-based method can improve object viewpoint
estimation by reducing specific types of viewpoint estimation errors commonly
made by methods that only consider local information. Moreover, considering
contextual information produces superior performance in scenes where a high
number of object instances occur. Finally, our results suggest that, following
a cautious relational neighbor formulation brings improvements over its
aggressive counterpart for the task of object viewpoint estimation.

solution of a diffusion equation to transition from initial to steady state.
Calculating a \textit{finite} transition time, defined as the time required for
the transient solution to transition to within a small prescribed tolerance of
the steady state solution, is much more useful in practice. In this paper, we
study estimates of finite transition times that avoid explicit calculation of
the transient solution by using the property that the transition to steady
state defines a cumulative distribution function when time is treated as a
random variable. In total, three approaches are studied: (i) mean action time
(ii) mean plus one standard deviation of action time and (iii) a new approach
derived by approximating the large time asymptotic behaviour of the cumulative
distribution function. The new approach leads to a simple formula for
calculating the finite transition time that depends on the prescribed tolerance
$\delta$ and the $(k-1)$th and $k$th moments ($k \geq 1$) of the distribution.
Results comparing exact and approximate finite transition times lead to two key
findings. Firstly, while the first two approaches are useful at characterising
the time scale of the transition, they do not provide accurate estimates for
diffusion processes. Secondly, the new approach allows one to calculate finite
transition times accurate to effectively any number of significant digits,
using only the moments, with the accuracy increasing as the index $k$ is
increased.

microstructure breaks down at high strains. The ultrafine-grained structure and
absence of porosity resulted in composites with Vickers hardness values of 600
for Cu30Mo70 and 475 for Cu50Mo50. The ability to produce Cu30Mo70
nanocomposites with a combination of high strength, and a fine, oriented
microstructure should be of interest for thermoelectric applications.

temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in these materials has drawn the attention of
research. However, the continuous wave operation of these emitters will
consequently turn them into systems with vastly imbalanced singlet and triplet
populations, which is due to the respective excited state lifetimes. This study
reports on the exciton dynamics of the biluminophore NPB
(N,N-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N-diphenyl-(1,1-biphenyl)-4,4-diamine). In the extreme
case, the singlet and triplet exciton lifetimes stretch from 3 ns to 300 ms,
respectively. Through sample engineering and oxygen quenching experiments, the
triplet exciton density can be controlled over several orders of magnitude
allowing to studying exciton interactions between singlet and triplet
manifolds. The results show, that singlet-triplet annihilation reduces the
overall biluminescence efficiency already at moderate excitation levels.
Additionally, the presented system represents an illustrative role model to
study excitonic effects in organic materials.

$\mathbf{KD4}$ and $\mathbf{S4}$. Then we will use these results to find a

covering standards and market requirements while it is costlty benefitial and
saves energy is desirable. Solar drying could be introduced as an appropriate
procedure in rural and collecting sites of saffron since major micorobial and
chemical factors of saffron can be preserved and achieved by using a renewable

record of integrated methods of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy
