exhibited poor generalizability. Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult
to reason about the behavior of these models beyond a certain level of input
complexity. In order to address these issues, we propose augmenting neural
architectures with a key abstraction: recursion. As an application, we
implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four
tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We
demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts
of training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and
drastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it
tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system's behavior. Our
experience suggests that in order for neural architectures to robustly learn
program semantics, it is necessary to incorporate a concept like recursion.

  Group-Specific Heterogeneity and Spatially Dependent Errors","158 pages",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel method to estimate large panel data
error-correction models with stationary/non-stationary covariates and spatially
dependent errors, which allows for known/unknown group-specific patterns of
slope heterogeneity. Analysis is based on composite quasi-likelihood (CQL)
maximization which performs estimation and classification simultaneously. The
proposed CQL estimator remains unbiased in the presence of misspecification of
the unobserved individual/group-specific fixed effects; therefore, neither
instrumental variables nor bias corrections/reductions are required. This
estimator also achieves the `oracle' property as the estimation errors of group
memberships have no effect on the asymptotic distributions of the
group-specific slope parameters estimates. Classification and estimation
involve a large-scale non-convex mixed-integer programming problem, which can
then be solved via a new algorithm based on DC (Difference-of-Convex functions)
programming - the DCA (DC Algorithm). Simulations confirm good finite-sample
properties of the proposed estimator. An empirical application and a software
package to implement this method are also provided.

Additionally, methods that do not use multiple levels of abstraction encounter

is improved when simultaneously inferring the degree of abstraction in language

our proposed approach enables a robot to respond to a command within one second

complicated by its dependence on three important energy scales: $P_T$, the top
quark mass $m_t$, and the Higgs mass $m_H$. A strategy for simplifying the
calculation of the cross section at large $P_T$ is to calculate only the
leading terms in its expansion in $m_t^2/P_T^2$ and/or $m_H^2/P_T^2$. The
expansion of the cross section in inverse powers of $P_T$ is complicated by

dependent on extracting knowledge from vast amounts of data. Although many
decision-making problems like developing urban areas require such perception
and reasoning, existing methods in this field usually neglect the deep
knowledge mined from geographic databases and are based on pure statistical
methods. Due to the large volume of data gathered in spatial databases, and the
uncertainty of spatial objects, mining association rules for high-level
knowledge representation is a challenging task. Few algorithms manage
geographical and non-geographical data using topological relations. In this
paper, a novel approach for spatial data mining based on the MOSES evolutionary
framework is presented which improves the classic genetic programming approach.
A hybrid architecture called GGeo is proposed to apply the MOSES mining rules
considering fuzzy topological relations from spatial data. The uncertainty and
fuzziness aspects are addressed using an enriched model of topological
relations by fuzzy region connection calculus. Moreover, to overcome the
problem of time-consuming fuzzy topological relationships calculations, this a
novel data pre-processing method is offered. GGeo analyses and learns from
geographical and non-geographical data and uses topological and distance
parameters, and returns a series of arithmetic-spatial formulas as
classification rules. The proposed approach is resistant to noisy data, and all
its stages run in parallel to increase speed. This approach may be used in
different spatial data classification problems as well as representing an
appropriate method of data analysis and economic policy making.

transfer the asymptotic consistency, and under mild conditions, asymptotic
normality, to the maximum likelihood estimate under the observed model.
Moreover, the variational estimator is also consistent and, under the same

what are the limits of nuclear binding? Exotic nuclei play a critical role in
both informing theoretical models as well as in our understanding of the origin
of the heavy elements. Our purpose is to refine existing mass models through
the training of an artificial neural network that will mitigate the large model
discrepancies far away from stability. The basic paradigm of our two-pronged
approach is an existing mass model that captures as much as possible of the
underlying physics followed by the implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network
(BNN) refinement to account for the missing physics. Bayesian inference is
employed to determine the parameters of the neural network so that model
predictions may be accompanied by theoretical uncertainties. Despite the
undeniable quality of the mass models adopted in this work, we observe a
significant improvement (of about 40%) after the BNN refinement is implemented.
Indeed, in the specific case of the Duflo-Zuker mass formula, we find that the
rms deviation relative to experiment is reduced from rms =0.503MeV to rms=0.286
MeV. These newly refined mass tables are used to map the neutron drip lines (or
rather ""drip bands"") and to study a few critical r-process nuclei. The BNN
approach is highly successful in refining the predictions of existing mass
models. In particular, the large discrepancy displayed by the original ""bare""
models in regions where experimental data is unavailable is considerably
quenched after the BNN refinement. This lends credence to our approach and has
motivated us to publish refined mass tables that we trust will be helpful for
future astrophysical applications.

to reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume starting from the dark

back iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively
reduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear
initial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative
displacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should
undo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order
infrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in
real space. At redshift $z=0$, we find that after eight iterations the
reconstructed density is more than $95\%$ correlated with the initial density
at $k\le 0.35\; h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The reconstruction also reduces the power
in the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2
orders of magnitude at $k\le 0.2\; h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and it extends the
range of scales where the full broadband shape of the power spectrum matches
linear theory by a factor of 2-3. As a specific application, we consider
measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be
improved by reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our
idealized dark matter simulations, the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise
ratio by a factor of 2.7 at $z=0$ and by a factor of 2.5 at $z=0.6$, improving
standard BAO reconstruction by $70\%$ at $z=0$ and $30\%$ at $z=0.6$, and

This method makes a clear distinction between SNe that are He-rich (IIb/Ib) and
He-poor (Ic) and further analysis is performed on each subgroup. For He-rich
SNe the presence of H becomes the focus. The strength, velocity, and ratio
between absorption and emission of H$\alpha$ is measured, along with additional
analysis of He I lines, in order to categorise the SNe. The He-poor SNe are
ordered according to the number of absorption features $N$ present in the
spectra, which is a measure of the degree of line blending. The kinetic energy
per unit mass $E_\mathrm{k}/M_\mathrm{ej}$ is strongly affected by mass at high
velocity and such situations principally occur when the outer density profile
of the ejecta is shallow, leading to the blending of lines. Using the results,
the existing SE-SN taxonomic scheme is adapted. He-rich SNe are split into four
groups, IIb, IIb(I), Ib(II), and Ib, which represent H-rich to H-poor SNe. The
SNe Ic category of broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) is abandoned in favour of quantifying
the line blending via $\left<N\right>$ before peak. To better reflect the
physical parameters of the explosions, the velocity of Si II at peak and the
half-luminosity decay time $t_{+1/2}$ are included to give SNe Ic a designation

Unfortunately, measurements of dynamic heterogeneities typically require

It is now possible to quantitatively characterize the relaxation process and
the emergence of dynamic heterogeneities using a straightforward method, here

variance of the differential frames, obtained subtracting images at different

appears in the differential frames, when the lag-time is set to the one
corresponding to the maximum dynamic susceptibility. This approach opens the
way to effectively characterize and tailor a wide variety of soft materials,

proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) in several interference-limited settings. In
this work, IGS is employed as an attempt to alleviate RSI. We use two
performance metrics, namely, the outage probability and the ergodic rate.
First, we provide upper and lower bounds for the system performance in terms of
the relay transmit power and circularity coefficient, a measure of the signal
impropriety. Then, we numerically optimize the relay signal parameters based
only on the channel statistics to improve the system performance. Based on the
analysis, IGS allows FDR to operate even with high RSI. The results show that
IGS can leverage higher power budgets to enhance the performance, meanwhile it
relieves RSI impact via tuning the signal impropriety. Interestingly,
one-dimensional optimization of the circularity coefficient, with maximum relay
power, offers a similar performance as the joint optimization, which reduces
the optimization complexity. From a throughput standpoint, it is shown that
IGS-FDR can outperform not only PGS-FDR, but also half-duplex relaying

relaxing the common assumption that the DM halo scale radius is tied to that of

velocity dispersion anisotropy, we prove that observations lead to rather weak
constraints on the DM mass, that could be as low as tens of eV. In this
scenario, however, the DM halos would be quite large and massive, so that a
bound stems from the requirement that the time of orbital decay due to
dynamical friction in the hosting Milky Way DM halo is longer than their
lifetime. The smallest and nearest satellites Segue I and Willman I lead to a
final lower bound of $m\gtrsim100$ eV, still weaker than previous estimates but

neutrinos, anti-neutrinos from nuclear reactors and the Earth's natural
radioactivity as well as Supernovae neutrinos. Located in the SNOLAB (Canada)
deep underground laboratory, it will re-use the SNO detector. A short phase
with the detector completely filled with water has started at the beginning of
2017, before running the detector with scintillator. This paper describes in

is the ability to constraint the low-energy background from radioactive decays.
Methods to mitigate those are also presented.

neutrinos from cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra, baryonic
acoustic oscillation data, and local measurements of the Hubble constant.
Specifically, we consider a Fermi-like four-fermion interaction between
massless neutrinos, characterized by an effective coupling constant $ G_{\rm
eff}$, and resulting in a neutrino opacity $\dot{\tau}_\nu\propto G_{\rm eff}^2
T_\nu^5$. Using a conservative prior on the parameter $\log_{10}\left(G_{\rm
eff} {\rm MeV}^2\right)$, we find a bimodal posterior distribution. The first
of these modes is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and
corresponds to neutrinos decoupling at redshift $z_{\nu,{\rm dec}} >
1.3\times10^5$. The other mode of the posterior, dubbed the ""interacting
neutrino mode"", corresponds to neutrino decoupling occurring within a narrow
redshift window centered around $z_{\nu,{\rm dec}}\sim8300$. This mode is
characterized by a high value of the effective neutrino coupling constant,
together with a lower value of the scalar spectral index and amplitude of
fluctuations, and a higher value of the Hubble parameter. Using both a maximum
likelihood analysis and the ratio of the two mode's Bayesian evidence, we find
the interacting neutrino mode to be statistically disfavored compared to the
standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Interestingly, the addition of CMB
polarization and direct Hubble constant measurements significantly raises the
statistical significance of this secondary mode, indicating that new physics in
the neutrino sector could help explain the difference between local
measurements of $H_0$, and those inferred from CMB data. A robust consequence
of our results is that neutrinos must be free streaming long before the epoch
of matter-radiation equality.

$0.1 \lesssim \mathrm{SFR} \lesssim 100\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and/or
$10^8 \lesssim M_* \lesssim 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. We use sample-mean BHAR to
approximate long-term average BHAR. Our sample-mean BHARs are derived from the
$Chandra$ Deep Field-South 7 Ms observations, while the SFRs and $M_*$ have
been estimated by the CANDELS team through SED fitting. The average BHAR is
correlated positively with both SFR and $M_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M_*$
relations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of
unity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M_*$ than
SFR. This result indicates that $M_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property
related to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a
secondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence. Among our sources,
massive galaxies ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) have significantly higher
BHAR/SFR ratios than less-massive galaxies, indicating the former have higher
black-hole fueling efficiency and/or higher SMBH occupation fraction than the
latter. Our results can naturally explain the observed proportionality between
$M_{\rm BH}$ and $M_*$ for local giant ellipticals, and suggest their $M_{\rm
BH}/M_*$ is higher than that of local star-forming galaxies. Among local
star-forming galaxies, massive systems might have higher $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$

If
cosmological structure formation determines the luminosity, size and shape
distributions of radio relics then merger shocks need to be lighted up in a
homogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed
galaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured
in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known
to date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply
the same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock
relic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,
suggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS
and mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend
to be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.
Besides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio
relics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest
linear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are
largely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show
a similar orientation with respect to the direction to the cluster centre as
the NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly
correlates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter. The overall
good agreement between NVSS and the mock sample suggests that properties of
radio relics are indeed governed by merger shock fronts, emitting in a
homogeneous fashion. Our study demonstrates that the combination of mock
observations and data from upcoming radio surveys will allow to shed light on
both the origin of radio relics and the nature of the intracluster medium.

more physical parameters. As an illustrative example, we consider the problem
of determining the response of a solid elastic cylinder subjected to a
time-harmonic surface pressure that varies sinusoidally along its axis, and we
demonstrate how the obtained parametric solutions can be used to efficiently
construct an exact solution to this problem. We also briefly consider
applications to some related forced-relaxation type problems.

better fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems

an effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the

approximate finite element solutions obtained from simulation. In the context
of Computational Mechanics, the construction of admissible stress fields (\ie
stress tensors which verify the equilibrium equations) is required to set up
strict and guaranteed error bounds (using residual based error estimators) and
plays an important role in the quality of the error estimates. This work
focuses on the different procedures used in the calculation of admissible
stress fields, which is a crucial and technically complicated point. The three
main techniques that currently exist, called the element equilibration
technique (EET), the star-patch equilibration technique (SPET), and the element
equilibration + star-patch technique (EESPT), are investigated and compared
with respect to three different criteria, namely the quality of associated
error estimators, computational cost and easiness of practical implementation
into commercial finite element codes. The numerical results which are presented
focus on industrial problems; they highlight the main advantages and drawbacks
of the different methods and show that the behavior of the three estimators,
which have the same convergence rate as the exact global error, is consistent.
Two- and three-dimensional experiments have been carried out in order to
compare the performance and the computational cost of the three different
approaches. The analysis of the results reveals that the SPET is more accurate
than EET and EESPT methods, but the corresponding computational cost is higher.
Overall, the numerical tests prove the interest of the hybrid method EESPT and
show that it is a correct compromise between quality of the error estimate,
practical implementation and computational cost.

redshift $z=0.0431$ and is projected within a few virial radii (assuming
similar redshifts) of two other ${\sim}L_\star$ galaxies, which we use to
bracket a potential redshift range of $0.0055 < z < 0.0431$. The object's light

passively evolving stellar population and similar to the nearby post-merger

offer two possible interpretations for the nature of this object: (1) it is an
extreme, galaxy-size tidal feature associated with a recent merger event, or
(2) it is a foreground dwarf galaxy with properties consistent with a quenched,
disturbed ultra-diffuse galaxy. We present a qualitative comparison with

perform a variety of important functions as membrane receptors, transport
proteins, enzymes, signaling proteins, and more. The computational studies of
membrane proteins are usually much more complicated than those of globular
proteins. Here we propose a new continuum model for Poisson-Boltzmann
calculations of membrane channel proteins. Major improvements over the existing
continuum slab model are as follows: 1) The location and thickness of the slab
model are fine-tuned based on explicit-solvent MD simulations. 2) The highly
different accessibility in the membrane and water regions are addressed with a
two-step, two-probe grid labeling procedure, and 3) The water pores/channels
are automatically identified. The new continuum membrane model is optimized (by
adjusting the membrane probe, as well as the slab thickness and center) to best
reproduce the distributions of buried water molecules in the membrane region as
sampled in explicit water simulations. Our optimization also shows that the
widely adopted water probe of 1.4 {\AA} for globular proteins is a very
reasonable default value for membrane protein simulations. It gives an overall
minimum number of inconsistencies between the continuum and explicit
representations of water distributions in membrane channel proteins, at least
in the water accessible pore/channel regions that we focus on. Finally, we
validate the new membrane model by carrying out binding affinity calculations
for a potassium channel, and we observe a good agreement with experiment
results.

these optimized bounding techniques is the use of properties of homothetic
domains which enables to cleverly derive guaranteed and accurate boundings of
contributions to the global error estimate over a local region of the domain.
Performances of these techniques are illustrated through several numerical
experiments.

  figures",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa6f0e",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are eruptive events that cause a solar-type
star to shed mass and magnetic flux. CMEs tend to occur together with flares,
radio storms, and bursts of energetic particles. On the Sun, CME-related mass
loss is roughly an order of magnitude less intense than that of the background
solar wind. However, on other types of stars, CMEs have been proposed to carry
away much more mass and energy than the time-steady wind. Earlier papers have
used observed correlations between solar CMEs and flare energies, in
combination with stellar flare observations, to estimate stellar CME rates.
This paper sidesteps flares and attempts to calibrate a more fundamental
correlation between surface-averaged magnetic fluxes and CME properties. For
the Sun, there exists a power-law relationship between the magnetic filling
factor and the CME kinetic energy flux, and it is generalized for use on other
stars. An example prediction of the time evolution of wind/CME mass-loss rates
for a solar-mass star is given. A key result is that for ages younger than
about 1 Gyr (i.e., activity levels only slightly higher than the present-day
Sun), the CME mass loss exceeds that of the time-steady wind. At younger ages,
CMEs carry 10 to 100 times more mass than the wind, and such high rates may be
powerful enough to dispel circumstellar disks and affect the habitability of
nearby planets. The cumulative CME mass lost by the young Sun may have been as
much as 1% of a solar mass.

shedding light on questions at the heart of quantum mechanics, as well as
advancing fields such as complexity theory, cryptography, key distribution, and
chemistry. These fundamental and applied aspects of quantum information rely on
a crucial issue: the ability to characterize a quantum state from measurements,
through a process called Quantum State Tomography (QST). However, QST requires
a large number of measurements, each derived from a different physical
observable corresponding to a different experimental setup. Unfortunately,
changing the setup results in unwanted changes to the data, prolongs the
measurement and impairs the assumptions that are always made about the
stationarity of the noise. Here, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by
performing QST with a single observable. A single observable can often be
realized by a single setup, thus considerably reducing the experimental effort.
In general, measurements of a single observable do not hold enough information
to recover the quantum state. We overcome this lack of information by relying
on concepts inspired by Compressed Sensing (CS), exploiting the fact that the
sought state - in many applications of quantum information - is close to a pure
state (and thus has low rank). Additionally, we increase the system dimension
by adding an ancilla that couples to information evolving in the system,
thereby providing more measurements, enabling the recovery of the original
quantum state from a single-observable measurements. We demonstrate our
approach on multi-photon states by recovering structured quantum states from a
single observable, in a single experimental setup. We further show how this
approach can be used to recover quantum states without number-resolving

per single use of the channel. However, different figures of merit are also
possible, and a particularly well-suited one is the classical capacity per unit

nature of the information carriers and communication channels and show that if
there exists a state with cost equal to zero, e.g. a vacuum state, the capacity
per unit cost can be expressed by a simple formula containing maximization of
the relative entropy between two quantum states. This enables me to analyze the

anthropomorphic traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that
contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we
need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population
genetics processes-notably, by mutation, natural selection and genetic drift.
Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and
genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model
the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing
selection in a multi-dimensional trait space. We solve the model for the
phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust,
closed form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our
results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it
varies among traits. They also predict that the distribution of variances
contributed by loci identified in GWAS is well approximated by a simple
functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution
to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test
this prediction against the results of GWAS for height and BMI and find that it
fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of
pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to
explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than
similarly-sized GWAS for BMI, and to predict the increase in explained
heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of
European populations, in which these GWAS were performed, we further find that
most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose
during the out of Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around

services by running Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on commercial
off-the-shelf servers. Service deployment involves placement of VNFs and
in-sequence routing of traffic flows through VNFs comprising a Service Chain
(SC). The joint VNF placement and traffic routing is usually referred as SC
mapping. In a Wide Area Network (WAN), a situation may arise where several
traffic flows, generated by many distributed node pairs, require the same SC,
one single instance (or occurrence) of that SC might not be enough. SC mapping
with multiple SC instances for the same SC turns out to be a very complex
problem, since the sequential traversal of VNFs has to be maintained while
accounting for traffic flows in various directions. Our study is the first to
deal with SC mapping with multiple SC instances to minimize network resource
consumption. Exact mathematical modeling of this problem results in a quadratic
formulation. We propose a two-phase column-generation-based model and solution
in order to get results over large network topologies within reasonable
computational times. Using such an approach, we observe that an appropriate
choice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to solution very close to
the minimum bandwidth consumption.

behavior; when it is spun in one direction, it soon begins pitching and stops
spinning, then it starts to spin in the opposite direction, but in the other
direction, it seems to spin just steadily. This puzzling behavior results from
the slight misalignment between the principal axes for the inertia and those
for the curvature; the misalignment couples the spinning with the pitching and
the rolling oscillations. It has been shown that under the no-slip condition
and without dissipation the spin can reverse in both directions, and Garcia and
Hubbard obtained the formula for the time required for the spin reversal $t_r$
[Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 418, 165-197 (1988) ]. In this work, we reformulate the
rattleback dynamics in a physically transparent way and reduce it to a
three-variable dynamics for spinning, pitching, and rolling. We obtain an
expression of the Garcia-Hubbard formula for $t_r$ by a simple product of four
factors: (1) the misalignment angle, (2) the difference in the inverses of
inertia moment for the two oscillations, (3) that in the radii for the two
principal curvatures, and (4) the squared frequency of the oscillation. We
perform extensive numerical simulations to examine validity and limitation of
the formula, and find that (1) the Garcia-Hubbard formula is good for both
spinning directions in the small spin and small oscillation regime, but (2) in
the fast spin regime especially for the steady direction, the rattleback may
not reverse and shows a rich variety of dynamics including steady spinning,
spin wobbling, and chaotic behavior reminiscent of chaos in a dissipative
system.

Let $0\leq\alpha\leq1,$ and let \[ A_{\alpha}(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G) \]
where $D(G)$ and $A(G)$ are the diagonal matrix of the vertex degrees of $G$
and the adjacency matrix of $G$, respectively. A basic result on the
$A_{\alpha}-$ spectrum of $R\{H\}$ is obtained. This result is used to prove
that if $H=B_{k}$ is a generalized Bethe tree on $k$ levels, then the
eigenvalues of $A_{\alpha}(R\{B_{k}\})$ are the eigenvalues of symmetric
tridiagonal matrices of order not exceeding $k$; additionally, the multiplicity
of each eigenvalue is determined. Finally, applications to a unicyclic graph
are given, including an upper bound on the $\alpha-$ spectral radius in terms
of the largest vertex degree and the largest height of the trees obtained by
removing the edges of the unique cycle in the graph.

numerically show that it converges in the $L_2$-norm with the optimal order
$\mathcal{O}(\tau^2 + h^2)$ with time step $\tau$ and mesh size $h$. Secondly,
three fast Krylov subspace solvers with suitable circulant preconditioners are
designed to solve the discretized linear systems with the Toeplitz matrix. In
each iterative step, these methods reduce the memory requirement of the
resulting linear equations from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and the
computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$,
where $N$ is the number of grid nodes. Finally, numerical experiments are
carried out to demonstrate that these methods are more practical than the
traditional direct solvers of the implicit difference methods, in terms of
memory requirement and computational cost.

directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for
resources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead. Extensive
performance evaluations showed that Dorm could simultaneously increase the
resource utilization by a factor of up to 2.32, reduce the fairness loss by a
factor of up to 1.52, and speed up popular distributed ML applications by a
factor of up to 2.72, compared to existing approaches. Dorm's sharing overhead

(AGN) are not capable of sustaining the dusty torus structure. Thus, a gradual
re-sizing of the torus is expected when the AGN luminosity decreases. Our aim
is to confront mid-infrared observations of local AGN of different luminosities
with this scenario. We decomposed about ~100 IRS/Spitzer spectra of LLAGN and
powerful Seyferts in order to decontaminate the torus component from other
contributors. We have used the affinity propagation (AP) method to cluster the
data into five groups within the sample according to torus contribution to the
5-15 um range (Ctorus) and bolometric luminosity. The AP groups show a
progressively higher torus contribution and an increase of the bolometric
luminosity, from Group 1 (Ctorus~ 0% and logLbol ~ 41) and up to Group 5
(Ctorus ~80% and log(Lbol) ~44). We have fitted the average spectra of each of
the AP groups to clumpy models. The torus is no longer present in Group 1,
supporting the disappearance at low-luminosities. We were able to fit the
average spectra for the torus component in Groups 3 (Ctorus~ 40% and log(Lbol)~
42.6), 4 (Ctorus~ 60% and log(Lbol)~ 43.7), and 5 to Clumpy torus models. We
did not find a good fitting to Clumpy torus models for Group 2 (Ctorus~ 18% and
log(Lbol)~ 42). This might suggest a different configuration and/or composition
of the clouds for Group 2, which is consistent with a different gas content
seen in Groups 1, 2, and 3, according to the detections of H2 molecular lines.
Groups 3, 4, and 5 show a trend to decrease of the width of the torus (which
yields to a likely decrease of the geometrical covering factor), although we
cannot confirm it with the present data. Finally, Groups 3, 4, and 5 show an
increase on the outer radius of the torus for higher luminosities, consistent
with a re-sizing of the torus according to the AGN luminosity.

between macroscopic ferroelectric properties and dipolar impurities of
different orientations, concentrations, and dipole moments. We find that the
collective orientation of dipolar defects relative to the external field is the
key microscopic structure feature that strongly affects materials
hardening/softening and electromechanical coupling. We show that a small
concentration (0.1 at.%) of defect dipoles dramatically improves
electromechanical response. This offers the opportunity to improve the
performance of inexpensive polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramics through
defect dipole engineering for a range of applications including piezoelectric

also important to determine the pair production efficiency in the pulsar

distribution in PWNe; the radio-emitting particles are not accelerated at the
pulsar wind termination shock but are stochastically accelerated by turbulence
inside PWNe. We upgrade our past one-zone spectral evolution model including
the energy diffusion, i.e., the stochastic acceleration, and apply to the Crab
Nebula. A fairly simple form of the energy diffusion coefficient is assumed for
this demonstrative study. For a particle injection to the stochastic
acceleration process, we consider the continuous injection from the supernova
ejecta or the impulsive injection associated with supernova explosion. The
observed broadband spectrum and the decay of the radio flux are reproduced by
tuning the amount of the particle injected to the stochastic acceleration
process. The acceleration time-scale and the duration of the acceleration are
required to be a few decades and a few hundred years, respectively. Our results
imply that some unveiled mechanisms, such as back reaction to the turbulence,

computing delay is minimized under latency and reliability constraints.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme guarantees reliable
computations with bounded latency and achieves up to 91% decrease in computing
latency as compared to baseline schemes.

the structure of Be discs in coplanar circular binary systems for a range of
orbital and disc parameters. The resulting disc configuration consists of two
spiral arms, and can be given as input into a Monte Carlo code, which
calculates the radiative transfer along the line of sight for various
observational coordinates. Making use of the property of steady disc structure
in coplanar circular binaries, observables are computed as functions of the
orbital phase. Orbital-phase series of line profiles are given for selected
parameter sets under various viewing angles, to allow comparison with
observations. Flat-topped profiles with and without superimposed multiple
structures are reproduced, showing, for example, that triple-peaked profiles do
not have to be necessarily associated with warped discs and misaligned
binaries. It is demonstrated that binary tidal effects give rise to
phase-locked variability of the violet-to-red (V/R) ratio of hydrogen emission
lines. The V/R ratio exhibits two maxima per cycle; in certain cases those
maxima are equal, leading to a clear new V/R cycle every half orbital period.
This study opens a way in identifying binaries and in constraining the
parameters of binary systems that exhibit phase-locked variations induced by
tidal interaction with a companion star.

object scales of images before generating object proposals. The proposed method
for predicting object scales is called ScaleNet. To validate the effectiveness

previous state-of-the-art on the supermarket datasets by a large margin. We

dream so far in spite of extensive work in this direction for almost two
decades. Here, we report the discovery of quasiperiodic ordering in a thick
layer of elemental Sn grown on icosahedral ($i$)-Al-Pd-Mn. The STM images and
the LEED patterns of the Sn layer show specific structural signatures that
portray quasiperiodicity but are distinct from the substrate. Photoemission
spectroscopy reveals the existence of the pseudogap around the Fermi energy up
to the maximal Sn thickness. The structure of the Sn layer is modeled as a
novel form of quasicrystalline clathrate on the basis of the following:
Firstly, from ab-initio theory, the energy of bulk Sn clathrate quasicrystal is
lower than the high temperature metallic $\beta$-Sn phase, but higher than the
low temperature $\alpha$-Sn phase. A comparative study of the free slab
energetics shows that surface energy favors clathrate over $\alpha$-Sn up to
about 4 nm layer thickness, and matches $\beta$-Sn for narrow window of slab
thickness of 2-3 nm. Secondly, the bulk clathrate exhibits gap opening near
Fermi energy, while the free slab form exhibits a pronouced pseudogap, which
explains the pseudogap observed in photoemission. Thirdly, the STM images
exhibit good agreement with clathrate model. We establish the adlayer-substrate
compatibility based on very similar (within 1%) the cage-cage separation in the
Sn clathrate and the pseudo-Mackay cluster-cluster separation on the
$i$-Al-Pd-Mn surface. Furthermore, the nucleation centers of the Sn adlayer on
the substrate are identified and these are shown to be a valid part of the Sn
clathrate structure. Thus, based on both experiment and theory, we propose that
4 nm thick Sn adlayer deposited on 5-fold surface of $i$-Al-Pd-Mn substrate is
in fact a metastable realization of elemental, clathrate family quasicrystal.

establish the consistency of the first LIGO event with a binary black hole
merger predicted by GR was the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. This

of binary black hole mergers, we expect the advanced GW observatories to
observe hundreds of binary black hole mergers every year when operating at
their design sensitivities, most of them with modest signal to noise ratios
(SNRs). Anticipating such observations, this paper shows how constraints from a
large number of events with modest SNRs can be combined to produce strong
constraints on deviations from GR. Using kludge modified GR waveforms, we
demonstrate how this test could identify certain types of deviations from GR if
such deviations are present in the signal waveforms. We also study the

  Our calculations employed the latest tabulated dust and gas mean opacities

distribution the system becomes less robust with respect to the initial failure
of a random bank, and that targeted shocks to the most specialised banks (i.e.
banks with low degrees) or biggest banks increases the probability of observing
a cascade of defaults. In contrast, we find that a power-law degree
distribution for assets increases stability with respect to random shocks, but
not with respect to targeted shocks. We also study how allocations of capital
buffers between banks affects the system's stability, and we find that
assigning capital to banks in relation to their level of diversification
reduces the probability of observing cascades of defaults relative to size

the resilience of the system by introducing disassortative mixing between banks

already exists prior to inflation, which is a reasonable assumption, then one
expects that a dynamical dark energy would leave some footprint in the
anisotropy of the late-time accelerated expansion. To demonstrate the viability
of this notion, we invoke the quintessence field with the exponential potential
as one of the simplest dynamical dark energy models allowed by observations. We
investigate the effects of its quantum fluctuations (the physical origin of the
perturbation being isocurvature) generated during inflation and having fully
positive correlation with the primordial curvature perturbations, and estimate
the anisotropy of the cosmic expansion so induced. We show that the primordial
amplitude of quantum fluctuations of quintessence field {\delta\phi}_P can be
related to the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and we calculate the perturbed
luminosity distance to first order and the associated luminosity distance power
spectrum, which is an estimator of anisotropicity of late-time accelerated
expansion. We find that the gravitational potential at large scales and late
times is less decayed in QCDM compared to that in {\Lambda}CDM so that the
smaller the redshift and multipole, the more relative deficit of power in QCDM.
Our results of luminosity distance power spectrum also show the similar
conclusions of suppression as that of the previous investigation regarding the

antiferromagnet (KAFM) is well established. Meanwhile, also for the $s=1$
Heisenberg KAFM evidence for the absence of magnetic long-range order (LRO) was
found. Magnetic LRO in Heisenberg KAFMs can emerge by increasing the spin
quantum number $s$ to $s>1$ and for $s=1$ by an easy-plane anisotropy. In the
present paper we discuss the route to magnetic order in $s=1/2$ KAFMs by
including an isotropic interlayer coupling (ILC) $J_\perp$ as well as an
easy-plane anisotropy in the kagome layers by using the coupled-cluster method
to high orders of approximation. We consider ferro- as well as
antiferromagnetic $J_\perp$. To discuss the general question for the crossover
from a purely two-dimensional (2D) to a quasi-2D and finally to a
three-dimensional system we consider the simplest model of stacked (unshifted)
kagome layers. Although the ILC of real kagome compounds is often more
sophisticated, such a geometry of the ILC can be relevant for barlowite. We
find that the spin-liquid ground state present for the strictly 2D $s=1/2$
$XXZ$ KAFM survives a finite ILC, where the spin-liquid region shrinks
monotonously with increasing anisotropy. If the ILC becomes large enough (about
15\% of intralayer coupling for the isotropic Heisenberg case and about 4\% for
the $XY$ limit) magnetic LRO can be established, where the $q=0$ symmetry is
favorable if $J_\perp$ is of moderate strength. If the strength of the ILC
further increases, $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ LRO can become favorable against
$q=0$ LRO.

hierarchy into Martin-L\""of type theory with an infinite sequence of universes.
It is shown that under this predicative interpretation some useful special
cases of Russell's reducibility axiom are valid, namely functional
reducibility. This is sufficient to make the type hierarchy usable for
development of constructive mathematics. We present a ramified type theory
suitable for this purpose. One may regard the results of this paper as an
alternative solution to the problems of Russell's theory, which avoids
impredicativity, but instead imposes constructive logic. The intuitionistic
ramified type theory introduced here, also suggests that there is a natural
associated notion of predicative elementary topos.

  exoplanets: A shallow water model",,,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa756e",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using a shallow water model with time-dependent forcing we show that the peak
of an exoplanet thermal phase curve is, in general, offset from secondary
eclipse when the planet is rotating. That is, the planetary hot-spot is offset
from the point of maximal heating (the substellar point) and may lead or lag
the forcing; the extent and sign of the offset is a function of both the
rotation rate and orbital period of the planet. We also find that the system
reaches a steady-state in the reference frame of the moving forcing. The model
is an extension of the well studied Matsuno-Gill model into a full spherical
geometry and with a planetary-scale translating forcing representing the
insolation received on an exoplanet from a host star.
  The speed of the gravity waves in the model is shown to be a key metric in
evaluating the phase curve offset. If the velocity of the substellar point
(relative to the planet's surface) exceeds that of the gravity waves then the
hotspot will lag the substellar point, as might be expected by consideration of
forced gravity wave dynamics. However, when the substellar point is moving
slower than the internal wavespeed of the system the hottest point can lead the
passage of the forcing. We provide an interpretation of this result by
consideration of the Rossby and Kelvin wave dynamics as well as, in the very
slowly rotating case, a one-dimensional model that yields an analytic solution.
Finally, we consider the inverse problem of constraining planetary rotation
rate from an observed phase curve.

assumed to be the same throughout the medium, determined solely by the
chirality of constituent molecules or chiral additives, albeit distortions of
the ground-state helicoidal configuration often arise due to the effects of
confinement and external fields. We directly probe the twist directionality of
liquid crystal director structures through experimental three-dimensional
imaging and numerical minimization of the elastic free energy and show that
spatially localized regions of handedness opposite to that of the chiral liquid
crystal ground state can arise in the proximity of twisted-soliton-bound
topological point defects. In chiral nematic liquid crystal confined to a film
that has a thickness less than the cholesteric pitch and perpendicular surface
boundary conditions, twisted solitonic structures embedded in a uniform unwound
far-field background with chirality-matched handedness locally relieve
confinement-imposed frustration and tend to be accompanied by point defects and
smaller geometry-required energetically costly regions of opposite twist
handedness. We also describe a new spatially localized structure, dubbed a
""twistion"", in which a twisted solitonic three-dimensional director
configuration is accompanied by four point defects. We discuss how our findings
may impinge on the stability of localized particle-like director field
configurations in chiral and non-chiral liquid crystals.

for radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) along the parsec-scale radio jets
as a manifestation of their optical structure on scales of 1 to 100
milliarcseconds. The extended jet structure affects the Gaia position stronger
than the VLBI position due to the difference in observing techniques. Gaia
detects total power while VLBI measures the correlated quantity, visibility,
and therefore, sensitive to compact structures. The synergy of VLBI that is
sensitive to the position of the most compact source component, usually
associated with the opaque radio core, and Gaia that is sensitive to the
centroid of optical emission, opens a window of opportunity to study optical
jets at milliarcsecond resolution, two orders of magnitude finer than the
resolution of most existing optical instruments. We demonstrate that strong
variability of optical jets is able to cause a jitter comparable to the
VLBI/Gaia offsets at a quiet state, i.e. several milliarcseconds. We show that
the VLBI/Gaia position jitter correlation with the AGN optical light curve may
help to locate the region where the flare occurred, estimate its distance from
the super-massive black hole and the ratio of the flux density in the flaring
region to the total flux density.

experimental and numerical analysis of such localized structures in liquid
crystals that, similar to the mathematical Hopf maps, relates all points of the
medium's order parameter space to their closed-loop preimages within the
three-dimensional solitons. We uncover a surprisingly large diversity of
naturally occurring and laser-generated topologically nontrivial solitons with
differently knotted nematic fields, which previously have not been realized in
theories and experiments alike. We discuss the implications of the liquid

chirality, confinement and elastic anisotropy help to overcome the constrains
of the Hobart-Derrick theorem, yielding static three-dimensional solitons
without or with additional defects. Our findings will establish chiral nematics

intelligent management of a backhaul/fronthaul network for these small-cell
base stations. This involves efficient association and placement of the
backhaul hubs that connects these small-cells with the core network.
Terrestrial hubs suffer from an inefficient non line of sight link limitations
and unavailability of a proper infrastructure in an urban area. Seeing the
popularity of flying platforms, we employ here an idea of using networked
flying platform (NFP) such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, unmanned
balloons flying at different altitudes, as aerial backhaul hubs. The
association problem of these NFP-hubs and small-cell base stations is
formulated considering backhaul link and NFP related limitations such as
maximum number of supported links and bandwidth. Then, this paper presents an
efficient and distributed solution of the designed problem, which performs a
greedy search in order to maximize the sum rate of the overall network. A
favorable performance is observed via a numerical comparison of our proposed

selection is based on non- functional quality dimensions of service, and
finally the service composition aims to support an underlying process. Most of
those approaches explore techniques of static or dynamic design for an optimal

  International Conference ISTA'2007",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quality is a multidimensional concept that has different meanings in
different contexts and perspectives. In the domain of Information system,
quality is often understood as the result of an IS development process and as
the quality of an IS product. Many models and frameworks have been proposed for
evaluating IS quality. However, as yet there is not a commonly accepted
framework or standard of IS quality. Typically, researchers propose a set of
characteristics, so-called quality factors contributing to the quality of IS.
Different stakeholders perspectives are resulting in multiple definitions of
quality factors of IS. For instance, some approaches are based on the IS
delivery process for the selection of quality factors; while some other
approaches do not clearly explain the rationale of their selection. Moreover,
often relations or impacts among selected quality factors are not taken into
account. Quality aspects of information are frequently considered isolated from
IS quality. The impact of IS quality on information quality seems to be
neglected in most approaches. Our research aims to incorporate these levels, by
which we propose an IS quality framework based on IS architecture. Considering
user and IS developers perspectives, different quality factors are identified
for various abstraction levels. Besides, the presentation on impacts among
different quality factors helps to retrieve the root cause of IS defects. Thus,
our framework provides a systematic view on quality of information and IS.
