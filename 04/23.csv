since the original idea was developed almost 40 years ago. After the success of
its full application to a large-scale neutrino experiment, OPERA, a much faster
readout system, the hyper-track selector (HTS), has been developed. HTS, which
has an extremely wide-field objective lens, reached a scanning speed of 4700
cm$^2$/h, which is nearly 100 times faster than the previous system and
therefore strongly promotes many new experimental projects. We will describe
the concept, specifications, system structure, and achieved performance in this

is determined by formulating a constrained optimization problem using the
quasi-static model of the robot. Moreover, a minimum friction coefficient value

statistical physics that applies concepts from traditional physics to

connected graph and are characterized by the number of coins they possess.
Agents independently spend one coin at rate one for their basic need, earn one
coin at a rate chosen independently from a fixed distribution $\phi$ and
exchange money at rate $\mu$ with one of their nearest neighbors, with the
richest neighbor giving one coin to the other neighbor. If an agent needs to
spend one coin when her fortune is at zero, she dies, i.e., the corresponding
vertex is removed from the graph. Our first results focus on the two extreme
cases of lack of cooperation $\mu = 0$ and perfect cooperation $\mu = \infty$

agents earn more than they spend, cooperation is beneficial for the survival of
the population, whereas when overall the agents earn less than they spend,
cooperation becomes detrimental. The infinite one-dimensional system is also
studied. In this case, when the agents earn less than they spend in average,
the density of agents that die eventually is bounded from below by a positive
constant that does not depend on the initial number of coins per agent or the

facility location, and is closely related to the packing problem. The goal is
to locate n points (e.g., facilities or persons) in a k-dimensional polytope,
so that they are far away from each other and from the boundary of the
polytope. In many real-world scenarios however, the points arrive and depart at
different times, and decisions must be made without knowing future events.
Therefore we study, for the first time in the literature, the online dispersion
problem in Euclidean space.
  There are two natural objectives when time is involved: the all-time
worst-case (ATWC) problem tries to maximize the minimum distance that ever
appears at any time; and the cumulative distance (CD) problem tries to maximize
the integral of the minimum distance throughout the whole time interval.
Interestingly, the online problems are highly non-trivial even on a segment.
For cumulative distance, this remains the case even when the problem is
time-dependent but offline, with all the arriving and departure times given in
advance.
  For the online ATWC problem on a segment, we construct a deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm which is (2ln2+epsilon)-competitive, where epsilon>0
can be arbitrarily small and the algorithm's running time is polynomial in
1/epsilon. We show this algorithm is actually optimal. For the same problem in
a square, we provide a 1.591-competitive algorithm and a 1.183 lower-bound.
Furthermore, for arbitrary k-dimensional polytopes with k>=2, we provide a
2/(1-epsilon)-competitive algorithm and a 7/6 lower-bound. Interestingly, for
the offline CD problem in arbitrary k-dimensional polytopes, we provide a
polynomial-time black-box reduction to the online ATWC problem, and the
resulting competitive ratio increases by a factor of at most 2.

high-priority incumbents. We study a model in which wireless Service Providers
(SPs) charge for access to their own exclusive-use (licensed) band along with
access to an additional shared band. The total, or delivered price in each band
is the announced price plus a congestion cost, which depends on the load, or
total users normalized by the bandwidth. The shared band is intermittently
available with some probability, due to incumbent activity, and when
unavailable, any traffic carried on that band must be shifted to licensed
bands. The SPs then compete for quantity of users. We show that the value of
the shared band depends on the relative sizes of the SPs: large SPs with more
bandwidth are better able to absorb the variability caused by intermittency
than smaller SPs. However, as the amount of shared spectrum increases, the
large SPs may not make use of it. In that scenario shared spectrum creates more
value than splitting it among the SPs for exclusive use. We also show that
fixing the average amount of available shared bandwidth, increasing the
reliability of the band is preferable to increasing the bandwidth.

$w=w_1w_2$ and $\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}<\frac{3}{2}$. This
improves the recent results of Culiuc et al. by increasing the families of
weights for which this inequality holds and by pushing the lower bound on $p$
from $1$ down to $\frac{2}{3}$, the critical index from the unweighted theory
of the bilinear Hilbert transform. Second, as an easy consequence of our method
we obtain that the bilinear Hilbert transform satisfies some vector-valued
inequalities with Muckenhoupt weights. This reproves and generalizes some of
the vector-valued estimates obtained by Benea and Muscalu in the unweighted
case. We also generalize recent results of Carando, et al. on
Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund estimates for multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators.

changing the geometry of the path, and we derive the correct acceptance

non-invertible sampling techniques commonly found in practice, and introduce
probabilistic inverses that extend our perturbation to cover most sampling

inverses with RJMCMC yielding an unbiased algorithm, which we call Reversible

fundamental molecular processes involved in living biological systems, but also
of the fascinating physics of life. Far more exotic than a collection of
exemplars of soft matter behaviour, active biological matter lives far from
thermal equilibrium, and typically covers multiple length scales from the
nanometre level of single molecules up several orders of magnitude to longer
length scales in emergent structures of cells, tissues and organisms.
Biological molecules are often characterized by an underlying instability, in
that multiple metastable free energy states exist which are separated by energy
levels of typically just a few multiples of the thermal energy scale of kBT,
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature, implying
complex, dynamic inter-conversion kinetics across this bumpy free energy
landscape in the relatively hot, wet environment of real, living biological
matter. The key utility of single-molecule biophysics lies in its ability to
probe the underlying heterogeneity of free energy states across a population of
molecules, which in general is too challenging for conventional ensemble level
approaches which measure mean average properties. Parallel developments in both
experimental and theoretical techniques have been key to the latest insights
and are enabling the development of highly-multiplexed, correlative techniques
to tackle previously intractable biological problems. Experimentally,
technological developments in the sensitivity and speed of biomolecular
detectors, the stability and efficiency of light sources, probes and
microfluidics, have enabled and driven the study of heterogeneous behaviours
both in vitro and in vivo that were previously undetectable by ensemble
methods...

applications such as search engines, news feeds, and recommendation systems.
Recent studies, however, have shown that, left unchecked, the output of ranking
algorithms can result in decreased diversity in the type of content presented,
promote stereotypes, and polarize opinions. In order to address such issues, we
study the following variant of the traditional ranking problem when, in
addition, there are fairness or diversity constraints. Given a collection of
items along with 1) the value of placing an item in a particular position in
the ranking, 2) the collection of sensitive attributes (such as gender, race,
political opinion) of each item and 3) a collection of constraints that, for
each k, bound the number of items with each attribute that are allowed to
appear in the top k positions of the ranking, the goal is to output a ranking
that maximizes the value with respect to the original rank quality metric while
respecting the constraints. This problem encapsulates various well-studied
problems related to bipartite and hypergraph matching as special cases and
turns out to be hard to approximate even with simple constraints. Our main
technical contributions are fast exact and approximation algorithms along with
complementary hardness results that, together, come close to settling the
approximability of this constrained ranking maximization problem. Unlike prior
work on the constrained matching problems, our algorithm runs in linear time,
even when the number of constraints is large, its approximation ratio does not
depend on the number of constraints, and it produces solutions with small
constraint violations. Our results rely on insights about the constrained
matching problem when the objective satisfies properties that appear in common
ranking metrics such as Discounted Cumulative Gain, Spearman's rho or
Bradley-Terry.

conditions such as sleep disorder and sleep deprivation affect one's daily
performance, and may also cause many chronic diseases. Many efforts have been
devoted to monitoring people's sleep conditions. However, traditional
methodologies require sophisticated equipment and consume a significant amount
of time. In this paper, we attempt to develop a novel way to predict
individual's sleep condition via scrutinizing facial cues as doctors would.
Rather than measuring the sleep condition directly, we measure the
sleep-deprived fatigue which indirectly reflects the sleep condition. Our
method can predict a sleep-deprived fatigue rate based on a selfie provided by
a subject. This rate is used to indicate the sleep condition. To gain deeper
insights of human sleep conditions, we collected around 100,000 faces from
selfies posted on Twitter and Instagram, and identified their age, gender, and
race using automatic algorithms. Next, we investigated the sleep condition
distributions with respect to age, gender, and race. Our study suggests among
the age groups, fatigue percentage of the 0-20 youth and adolescent group is
the highest, implying that poor sleep condition is more prevalent in this age
group. For gender, the fatigue percentage of females is higher than that of
males, implying that more females are suffering from sleep issues than males.
Among ethnic groups, the fatigue percentage in Caucasian is the highest
followed by Asian and African American.

since the skeleton of chaos can consist of infinitely many unstable periodic
motions. This is true for chaos in the sense of Devaney [1], Li-Yorke [2] and
the one obtained through period-doubling cascade [3]. Countable number of
periodic orbits exist in any neighborhood of a structurally stable Poincar\'{e}
homoclinic orbit, which can be considered as a criterion for the presence of
complex dynamics [4]-[6]. It was certified by Shilnikov [7] and Seifert [8]
that it is possible to replace periodic solutions by Poisson stable or almost
periodic motions in a chaotic attractor. Despite the fact that the idea of
replacing periodic solutions by other types of regular motions is attractive,
very few results have been obtained on the subject. The present study
contributes to the chaos theory in that direction.
  In this paper, we take into account chaos both through a cascade of almost
periodic solutions and in the sense of Li-Yorke such that the original Li-Yorke
definition is modified by replacing infinitely many periodic motions with
almost periodic ones, which are separated from the motions of the scrambled
set. The theoretical results are valid for systems with arbitrary high
dimensions. Formation of the chaos is exemplified by means of unidirectionally
coupled Duffing oscillators. The controllability of the extended chaos is
demonstrated numerically by means of the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke [9] control
technique. In particular, the stabilization of tori is illustrated.

collecting and analyzing environmental, social and other spatiotemporal

of workers, who will perform the tasks by physically traveling to the tasks'
locations. This chapter identifies privacy threats toward both workers and
requesters during the two main phases of spatial crowdsourcing, tasking and
reporting. Tasking is the process of identifying which tasks should be assigned
to which workers. This process is handled by a spatial crowdsourcing server
(SC-server). The latter phase is reporting, in which workers travel to the
tasks' locations, complete the tasks and upload their reports to the SC-server.
The challenge is to enable effective and efficient tasking as well as reporting
in SC without disclosing the actual locations of workers (at least until they
agree to perform a task) and the tasks themselves (at least to workers who are
not assigned to those tasks). This chapter aims to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art in protecting users' location privacy in spatial

comparable to sophisticated nonlinear schemes. The key insight is that the
boundary data for many conformal mapping problems can be efficiently
constructed via the Cherrier formula together with a pair of Poincare-Steklov
operators; once the boundary is known, the map can be easily extended over the
rest of the domain. Since computation demands only a single factorization of
the real Laplace matrix, the amortized cost is about 50x less than any
previously published technique for boundary-controlled conformal flattening. As
a result, BFF opens the door to real-time editing or fast optimization of
high-resolution maps, with direct control over boundary length or angle. We
show how this method can be used to construct maps with sharp corners, cone
singularities, minimal area distortion, and uniformization over the unit disk;
we also demonstrate for the first time how a surface can be conformally
flattened directly onto any given target shape.

measurement campaigns that study the nature of the wireless propagation
channel. However, despite their undoubted usefulness, many of these studies
have omitted a fundamental yet key feature of the physical signal propagation,
that is, wireless propagation asymmetry. This feature does not agree with the
electromagnetic reciprocity theorem, and the many research papers that adopt
wireless channel symmetry, and hence rendering their modeling, unexpectedly,
inaccurate. Besides, asymmetry is unquestionably an important characteristic of
wireless channels, which needs to be accurately characterized for
vehicular/mobile communications, 5G networks, and associated applications such
as indoor/outdoor localization. This paper presents a modest and a preliminary
study that reports potential causes of propagation asymmetry. Measurements
conducted on Khalifa University campus in UAE show that wireless channels are
symmetric in the absence of symmetry impairments. Therefore, care should be
taken when considering some practical wireless propagation scenarios. Key
conclusions and recommendation are summarized. We believe that this study will
be inspiring for the academic community and will trigger further investigations
within wireless propagation assumptions.

unitary transformation, we can reduce the $2N \times 2N$ Hamiltonian matrix
into two real $N \times N$ tridiagonal matrices $\mathbb{H}_{s}$ and
$\mathbb{H}_{a}$, i. e., $H_0=\mathbb{H}_{s} \oplus \mathbb{H}_{a} $. What's
more, the two matrices satisfy the relation $\mathbb{H}_{a}=-\mathbb{H}_{s}$.
As a result, energy spectrum associated with $\mathbb{H}_{s}$ and
$\mathbb{H}_{s}$ have the relation $\lambda_{a}=-\lambda_{s}$. Such a
characteristic is reflected on the energy dispersions and density of states.

(OFUL) hold under the assumption that the arms expected rewards are perfectly
linear in their features. It is, however, of interest to investigate the impact
of potential misspecification in linear bandit models, where the expected
rewards are perturbed away from the linear subspace determined by the arms
features. Although OFUL has recently been shown to be robust to relatively
small deviations from linearity, we show that any linear bandit algorithm that
enjoys optimal regret performance in the perfectly linear setting (e.g., OFUL)
must suffer linear regret under a sparse additive perturbation of the linear
model. In an attempt to overcome this negative result, we define a natural
class of bandit models characterized by a non-sparse deviation from linearity.
We argue that the OFUL algorithm can fail to achieve sublinear regret even
under models that have non-sparse deviation.We finally develop a novel bandit
algorithm, comprising a hypothesis test for linearity followed by a decision to
use either the OFUL or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. For perfectly
linear bandit models, the algorithm provably exhibits OFULs favorable regret
performance, while for misspecified models satisfying the non-sparse deviation
property, the algorithm avoids the linear regret phenomenon and falls back on
UCBs sublinear regret scaling. Numerical experiments on synthetic data, and on
recommendation data from the public Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge dataset,
empirically support our findings.

viewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between

multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the
embedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often
visually similar but functionally different. In other words, the model
simultaneously learns to recognize what is common between different-looking

causes our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint,

occlusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this

maxima too high. Therefore additional photo-hadronic interactions of UEHCRs
close to the accelerator have to be present, in order to modify the nuclear
composition of CRs in a relatively narrow energy interval. We include thus both
photon and gas backgrounds, and combine the resulting CR spectra with the
high-energy part of the Galactic CR fluxes predicted by the escape model. As
result, we find a good description of experimental data on the total CR flux,
the mean shower depth $X_\max$ and its width $RMS(X_\max)$ in the whole energy
range above $E\simeq 10^{17}$ eV. The predicted high-energy neutrino flux
matches IceCube measurements, while the contribution to the EGRB is of order
30%.

technology to ensure traffic safety and other mission-critical applications. In
this paper, a novel proximity and quality-of-service (QoS)-aware resource
allocation for V2V communication is proposed. The proposed approach exploits
the spatial-temporal aspects of vehicles in terms of their physical proximity
and traffic demands, to minimize the total transmission power while considering
queuing latency and reliability. Due to the overhead caused by frequent
information exchange between vehicles and the roadside unit (RSU), the
centralized problem is decoupled into two interrelated subproblems. First, a
novel RSU-assisted virtual clustering mechanism is proposed to group vehicles
in zones based on their physical proximity. Given the vehicles' traffic demands
and their QoS requirements, resource blocks are assigned to each zone. Second,
leveraging techniques from Lyapunov stochastic optimization, a power
minimization solution is proposed for each V2V pair within each zone.
Simulation results for a Manhattan model have shown that the proposed scheme
outperforms the baseline in terms of average queuing latency reduction up to
97% and significant improvement in reliability.

auctioneer is interested in buying resources or services from a set of agents.
Ideally, the auctioneer would like to select a subset of the resources so as to
maximize his valuation function, without exceeding a given budget. As the
resources are owned by strategic agents however, our overall goal is to design
mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible, and obtain a good approximation
to the optimal value. Budget-feasibility creates additional challenges, making
several approaches inapplicable in this setting. Previous results on
budget-feasible mechanisms have considered mostly monotone valuation functions.
In this work, we mainly focus on symmetric submodular valuations, a prominent
class of non-monotone submodular functions that includes cut functions. We
begin first with a purely algorithmic result, obtaining a
$\frac{2e}{e-1}$-approximation for maximizing symmetric submodular functions
under a budget constraint. We view this as a standalone result of independent
interest, as it is the best known factor achieved by a deterministic algorithm.
We then proceed to propose truthful, budget feasible mechanisms (both
deterministic and randomized), paying particular attention on the Budgeted Max
Cut problem. Our results significantly improve the known approximation ratios
for these objectives, while establishing polynomial running time for cases
where only exponential mechanisms were known. At the heart of our approach lies
an appropriate combination of local search algorithms with results for monotone
submodular valuations, applied to the derived local optima.

ratio $m/M$. For energies, theoretical results are complete through orders
$\alpha^6m$ and $\alpha^6m^2/M$, with the resulting accuracy ranging from $0.5$
to $2$~MHz for the $n=2$ states. The fine-structure splitting of the $2^3P$

calculation of the next-order $\alpha^7m$ effect. An excellent agreement of the
theoretical predictions with the recent measurements of the fine structure
provides one of the best tests of the bound-state QED in few-electron systems
and determines the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ with an accuracy of 31~ppb.
The isotope shift between $^3$He and $^4$He is treated theoretically with a
sub-kHz accuracy, which allows for a high-precision determination of the
differences of the nuclear charge radii $\delta r^2$. Several such
determinations, however, yield results that are in a 4$\sigma$ disagreement
with each other, what remains unexplained. Apart from this, we find no
significant discrepancies between theory and experiment for the helium atom. In
the future, a calculation of the next-order $\alpha^7m$ effect for energy
levels will enable determinations of the nuclear charge radii from atomic
transition frequencies with an accuracy better than 1\%. Combined with the
complementary determinations from muonic atoms, this will provide a sensitive
test of universality in electromagnetic interactions of leptons and contribute
to the solution of the proton charge radius puzzle.

tolerant subgraph for Breath First Search tree (BFS) of the graph from a single
source $s\in V$ (referred as $k$ FT-BFS) or multiple sources $S\subseteq V$
(referred as $k$ FT-MBFS).
  The problem of $k$ FT-BFS was first studied by Parter and Peleg [ESA13]. They
designed an algorithm to compute FT-BFS subgraph of size $O(n^{3/2})$. Further,
they showed how their algorithm can be easily extended to FT-MBFS requiring
$O(\sigma^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ space. They also presented matching lower bounds for
these results. The result was later extended to solve dual FT-BFS by Parter
[PODC15] requiring $O(n^{5/3})$ space, again with matching lower bounds.
However, their result was limited to only edge failures in undirected graphs
and involved very complex analysis. Moreover, their solution doesn't seems to
be directly extendible for dual FT-MBFS problem.
  We present a similar algorithm to solve dual FT-BFS problem with a much
simpler analysis. Moreover, our algorithm also works for vertex failures and
directed graphs, and can be easily extended to handle dual FT-MBFS problem,
matching the lower bound of $O(\sigma^{1/3}n^{5/3})$ space described by Parter
[PODC15].The key difference in our approach is a much simpler classification of
path interactions which formed the basis of the analysis by Parter [PODC15].

that the pdf gets given by the stationary two space-time points correlation

the multi-D$_2$ {\it Ansatz}, also known as a superposition of the usual
Davydov D$_2$ trial states. Resultant polaron dynamics has significantly
enhanced accuracy, and is in perfect agreement with that derived from the
hierarchy equations of motion method. Starting from an initial broad wave
packet, the exciton undergoes typical Bloch oscillations. Adding weak
exciton-phonon coupling leads to a broadened exciton wave packet and a reduced
current amplitude. Using a narrow wave packet as the initial state, the bare
exciton oscillates in a symmetric breathing mode, but the symmetry is easily
broken by weak coupling to phonons, resulting in a non-zero exciton current.
For both scenarios, temporal periodicity is unchanged by exciton-phonon
coupling. In particular, at variance with the case of an infinite linear chain,
no steady state is found in a finite-sized ring within the anti-adiabatic

capacity upgrade, whose optimal decision making, however, may incur high
computational burden. A practical way is to find out some critical branches as
the candidates in advance. This paper proposes a simulation data oriented
approach to identify the critical branches with higher importance in cascading
failure propagation. First, a concept of cascading failure chain (CFC) is
introduced and numerous samples of CFC are generated with an AC power flow
based cascading failure simulator. Then, a directed weighted graph is
constructed, whose edges denotes the severities of branch interactions. Third,
the weighted hypertext-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm is used to rate
and rank this graph's vertices,through which the critical branches can be
identified accordingly. Validations on IEEE 118bus and RTS96 systems show that
the proposed approach can identify critical branches whose capacity upgrades
suppress cascading failure risk more greatly. Moreover, it is also shown that
structural importance of a branch does not agree with its importance in
cascading failure, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach
compared with structure vulnerabilities based identifying methods.

of the objective function and its derivatives (at points where they are
defined) to produce an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point. This

feasible set to be 'kernel-centered' (which includes bound constraints and many
other cases of interest), or for non-Lipschitz models, at the price of passing
the difficulty to the computation of the step. Since this complexity bound is

introducing non-Lipschitzian singularities in the objective function may not

using the problem's partially separable structure (if present) does not affect
complexity order either. A final (worse) complexity bound is derived for the

infinite-dimensional, and also it enjoys the Hine-Borel property. Using these
properties, $\tau_c$-compact sets are characterized and a characterization of
finite-dimensionality is provided. Finally, it is shown that the properties of
the core convex topology lead to directly extending various important results

additional linear term is introduced to account the perturbation from a
particular potential of externally applied force. The effect manifestation is
demonstrated on the light beams propagating through a planar waveguide. The
waveguide consists of a nonlinear layer able to guide dissipative solitons, and
a magneto-optic substrate. In the waveguide an externally applied force is
considered to be an inhomogeneous magnetic field which is induced by modulated
electric currents flowing along a set of direct conducting wires adjusted on

variations are present on virtually all L and T dwarfs. Their likely magnetic
or dusty nature has been a much-debated problem, the resolution to which has
been hindered by paucity of diagnostic multi-wavelength observations. To test
for a correlation between magnetic activity and photometric variability, we
searched for H$\alpha$ emission among eight L3$-$T2 ultra-cool dwarfs with
extensive previous photometric monitoring, some of which are known to be
variable at 3.6 $\mu$m or 4.5 $\mu$m. We detected H$\alpha$ only in the
non-variable T2 dwarf 2MASS J12545393$-$0122474. The remaining seven objects do
not show H$\alpha$ emission, even though six of them are known to vary
photometrically. Combining our results with those for 86 other L and T dwarfs
from the literature show that the detection rate of H$\alpha$ emission is very
high (94$\%$) for spectral types between L0 and L3.5 and much smaller (20$\%$)
for spectral types $\ge$L4, while the detection rate of photometric variability
is approximately constant (30$\%-$55$\%$) from L0 to T8 dwarfs. We conclude
that chromospheric activity, as evidenced by H$\alpha$ emission, and
large-amplitude photometric variability are not correlated. Consequently, dust
clouds are the dominant driver of the observed variability of ultra-cool dwarfs
at spectral types at least as early as L0.

in the short term and strong correlations in the long term for all stocks
except for an outlier stock. The long-term correlation is found to depend on
several firm specific characteristics. We also find that there are nonlinear
long-term correlations in the order aggressiveness when we perform the
multifractal detrending moving average analysis.
