Vector Field Electron Tomography (VFET) can be used to reconstruct
electromagnetic potentials of the nanoparticles from their corresponding LTEM
images. The VFET approach is based on the conventional filtered back projection
approach to tomographic reconstructions and the availability of an incomplete

reconstructed vector fields exhibit significant artifacts. In this paper, we
outline a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm to reconstruct
the magnetic vector potential of magnetic nanoparticles. We combine a forward
model for image formation in TEM experiments with a prior model to formulate
the tomographic problem as a maximum a-posteriori probability estimation
problem (MAP). The MAP cost function is minimized iteratively to determine the
vector potential. A comparative reconstruction study of simulated as well as
experimental data sets show that the MBIR approach yields quantifiably better
reconstructions than the VFET approach.

possibility to obtain different responses triggered by safe remote stimulus.
However, such richness can be detrimental if the different performances are not
accurately differentiated (and controlled). An example of this is the
reorientation of magnetic nanoparticles under the influence of AC fields, which
can be exploited for either magneto-mechanical actuation (MMA) at low
frequencies (tens of Hz); or heat release at large ones (MHz range). While it
is clear that Brownian rotation is responsible for MMA, its heating role in the
high-frequency regime is not clear. In this work we aim to shed light on this
issue, which needs to be well understood for applications in magnetic fluid
hyperthermia (MFH) or heat triggered drug release. Using a Brownian dynamics
(BD) simulation technique, we have theoretically investigated the contribution
of Brownian reversal in disk-shape particles (to enhance the viscous
interaction with the environment) over a wide range of frequencies. Our results
predict essentially negligible hysteresis losses both in the high- and
low-frequency domains, with completely different implications: highly efficient
MMA, but negligible MFH performance. Importantly, complementary micromagnetic
simulations indicate that the large magnetic torque assumption of the BD
simulations is supported by hexagonal-shape disks, up to field amplitudes of
the order of 100 Oe. Larger fields would lead to N\'eel reversal which,
noteworthy, predicts significant heating performance. The possibility of
switching between the MMA and MFH response by changing the amplitude of the AC
field, together with their distinct optimal conditions (large magnetic torque
for MMF; large heating for MFH), points to such hexagonal nanodisks as
promising nanomedicine agents with double mechanical and heating
functionalities.

mobile wireless scenario: multiple-antenna additive white Gaussian noise
channels subject to random (fading) gain with full channel state information at
the receiver. Dynamics of the fading process are approximated by a
piecewise-constant process (frequency non-selective isotropic block fading).
This work addresses the finite blocklength fundamental limits of this channel
model. Specifically, we give a formula for the channel dispersion -- a quantity
governing the delay required to achieve capacity. Multiplicative nature of the
fading disturbance leads to a number of interesting technical difficulties that
required us to enhance traditional methods for finding channel dispersion.
Alas, one difficulty remains: the converse (impossibility) part of our result
holds under an extra constraint on the growth of the peak-power with
blocklength.
  Our results demonstrate, for example, that while capacities of $n_t\times
n_r$ and $n_r \times n_t$ antenna configurations coincide (under fixed received
power), the coding delay can be quite sensitive to this switch. For example, at
the received SNR of $20$ dB the $16\times 100$ system achieves capacity with
codes of length (delay) which is only $60\%$ of the length required for the
$100\times 16$ system. Another interesting implication is that for the MISO
channel, the dispersion-optimal coding schemes require employing orthogonal
designs such as Alamouti's scheme -- a surprising observation considering the
fact that Alamouti's scheme was designed for reducing demodulation errors, not
improving coding rate. Finding these dispersion-optimal coding schemes
naturally gives a criteria for producing orthogonal design-like inputs in
dimensions where orthogonal designs do not exist.

star forming region to derive star formation properties of $\sim$150 star
forming complexes over the face of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find that the
rate of massive star formation ramps up when stellar clusters emerge and boost
the formation of subsequent generations of massive stars. In addition, we
reveal that the star formation efficiency of individual GMCs declines with
increasing cloud gas mass ($M_\mathrm{cloud}$). This trend persists in Galactic
star forming regions, and implies higher molecular gas depletion times for
larger GMCs.
  We compare the star formation efficiency per freefall time
($\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$) with predictions from various widely-used analytical
star formation models. We show that while these models can produce large
dispersions in $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ similar to observations, the origin of
the model-predicted scatter is inconsistent with observations. Moreover, all
models fail to reproduce the observed decline of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ with
increasing $M_\mathrm{cloud}$ in the LMC and the Milky Way. We conclude that
analytical star formation models idealizing global turbulence levels, cloud
densities, and assuming a stationary SFR are inconsistent with observations

bundle adjustment. By directly minimizing reprojected pixel errors, instead of
geometric reprojection errors, such methods can achieve sub-pixel alignment
accuracy in both high and low textured regions. Typically, these problems are
solved using a forwards compositional Lucas-Kanade formulation parameterized by
6-DoF rigid camera poses and a depth per point in the structure. For large
problems the most CPU-intensive component of the pipeline is the creation and
factorization of the Hessian matrix at each iteration. For many warps, the
inverse compositional formulation can offer significant speed-ups since the
Hessian need only be inverted once. In this paper, we show that an ordinary
inverse compositional formulation does not work for warps of this type of
parameterization due to ill-conditioning of its partial derivatives. However,
we show that it is possible to overcome this limitation by introducing the
concept of a proxy template image. We show an order of magnitude improvement in
speed, with little effect on quality, going from forwards to inverse
compositional in our own photometric bundle adjustment method designed for
object-centric structure from motion. This means less processing time for large
systems or denser reconstructions under the same real-time constraints. We
additionally show that this theory can be readily applied to existing methods
by integrating it with the recently released Direct Sparse Odometry SLAM
algorithm.

reductions to deciding whether a system of polynomial equations over the real
numbers has a solution. The art gallery problem is a classical problem in
computational geometry. Given a simple polygon $P$ and an integer $k$, the goal
is to decide if there exists a set $G$ of $k$ guards within $P$ such that every
point $p\in P$ is seen by at least one guard $g\in G$. Each guard corresponds
to a point in the polygon $P$, and we say that a guard $g$ sees a point $p$ if
the line segment $pg$ is contained in $P$.
  The art gallery problem has stimulated extensive research in geometry and in
algorithms. However, the complexity status of the art gallery problem has not
been resolved. It has long been known that the problem is $\text{NP}$-hard, but
no one has been able to show that it lies in $\text{NP}$. Recently, the
computational geometry community became more aware of the complexity class
$\exists \mathbb{R}$. The class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ consists of problems that
can be reduced in polynomial time to the problem of deciding whether a system
of polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real
variables has a solution. It can be easily seen that $\text{NP}\subseteq
\exists \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the art gallery problem is $\exists
\mathbb{R}$-complete, implying that (1) any system of polynomial equations over
the real numbers can be encoded as an instance of the art gallery problem, and
(2) the art gallery problem is not in the complexity class $\text{NP}$ unless
$\text{NP}=\exists \mathbb{R}$. As a corollary of our construction, we prove
that for any real algebraic number $\alpha$ there is an instance of the art
gallery problem where one of the coordinates of the guards equals $\alpha$ in
any guard set of minimum cardinality. That rules out many geometric approaches
to the problem.

based on data-driven model order reduction. The objective is to image the
discontinuities of the acoustic velocity, a coefficient of the scalar wave
equation from the discretely sampled time domain data measured at an array of
transducers that can act as both sources and receivers. We treat the wave
equation along with transducer functionals as a dynamical system. A reduced
order model (ROM) for the propagator of such system can be computed so that it
interpolates exactly the measured time domain data. The resulting ROM is an
orthogonal projection of the propagator on the subspace of the snapshots of
solutions of the acoustic wave equation. While the wavefield snapshots are
unknown, the projection ROM can be computed entirely from the measured data,
thus we refer to such ROM as data-driven. The image is obtained by
backprojecting the ROM. Since the basis functions for the projection subspace
are not known, we replace them with the ones computed for a known smooth
kinematic velocity model. A crucial step of ROM construction is an implicit
orthogonalization of solution snapshots. It is a nonlinear procedure that
differentiates our approach from the conventional linear imaging methods
(Kirchhoff migration and reverse time migration - RTM). It resolves all
dynamical behavior captured by the data, so the error from the imperfect
knowledge of the velocity model is purely kinematic. This allows for almost
complete removal of multiple reflection artifacts, while simultaneously
improving the resolution in the range direction compared to conventional RTM.

pure variables, which are components of X that are associated, via A, with one
and only one latent factor. Despite the fact that the number of factors K, the
number of the pure variables, and their location are all unknown, we only
require a mild condition on the covariance matrix of Z, and a minimum of only
two pure variables per latent factor to show that A is uniquely defined, up to
signed permutations. Our proofs for model identifiability are constructive, and
lead to our novel estimation method of the number of factors and of the set of
pure variables, from a sample of size n of observations on X. This is the first
step of our LOVE algorithm, which is optimization-free, and has low
computational complexity of order p2. The second step of LOVE is an easily
implementable linear program that estimates A. We prove that the resulting
estimator is minimax rate optimal up to logarithmic factors in p. The model
structure is motivated by the problem of overlapping variable clustering,
ubiquitous in data science. We define the population level clusters as groups
of those components of X that are associated, via the sparse matrix A, with the
same unobservable latent factor, and multi-factor association is allowed.
Clusters are respectively anchored by the pure variables, and form overlapping
sub-groups of the p-dimensional random vector X. The Latent model approach to
OVErlapping clustering is reflected in the name of our algorithm, LOVE.

understand the conditions under which populations coexist or go extinct.
Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that coexistence can be
facilitated or negated by both biotic interactions and environmental
fluctuations. We study the dynamics of $n$ populations that live in a
stochastic environment and which can interact nonlinearly (through competition
for resources, predator-prey behavior, etc.). Our models are described by
$n$-dimensional Kolmogorov systems with white noise (stochastic differential
equations - SDE). We give sharp conditions under which the populations converge
exponentially fast to their unique stationary distribution as well as
conditions under which some populations go extinct exponentially fast.
  The analysis is done by a careful study of the properties of the invariant
measures of the process that are supported on the boundary of the domain. To
our knowledge this is one of the first general results describing the
asymptotic behavior of stochastic Kolmogorov systems in non-compact domains.
  We are able to fully describe the properties of many of the SDE that appear

Lotka-Volterra models, two dimensional predator-prey models, $n$ dimensional

the fraction of the intrinsic AGN IR-processed luminosity compared with that
from the central engine should be consistent with the dust-covering factor. In
addition, besides reproducing the composite spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of quasars, a correct AGN IR template combined with an accurate library
of star-forming galaxy templates should be able to reproduce the IR properties
of the host galaxies, such as the luminosity-dependent SED shapes and aromatic
feature strengths. We develop tests based on these expected behaviors and find
that the shape of the AGN intrinsic far-IR emission drops off rapidly starting
at $\sim20~\mu$m and can be matched by an Elvis et al. (1994)-like template
with minor modification. Despite the variations in the near- to mid-IR bands,
AGNs in quasars and Seyfert galaxies have remarkably similar intrinsic far-IR
SEDs at $\lambda \sim 20$-$100~\mu$ m, suggesting similar emission character of
the outermost region of the circumnuclear torus. The variations of the
intrinsic AGN IR SEDs among the type-1 quasar population can be explained by
the changing relative strengths of four major dust components with similar
characteristic temperatures, and there is evidence for compact AGN-heated dusty
structures at sub-kpc scales in the far-IR.

on-line and off-line state and parameter estimation. We take a Bayesian

use of ensemble Kalman methods for dimension reduction, which allows inference
for high-dimensional state vectors. We compare our methods to existing ones,
including ensemble Kalman filters, particle filters, and particle MCMC. Using a
real data example of cloud motion and data simulated under a number of

which are set on the bulk of the two null hypersurfaces, and additional

complete set of Poisson brackets of such data has been obtained. However the
complexity of these brackets is an obstacle to their quantization. Part of this
difficulty may be overcome using methods from the treatment of cylindrically
symmetric gravity. Specializing from general to cylindrically symmetric
solutions changes the Poisson algebra of the null initial data surprisingly
little, but cylindrically symmetric vacuum general relativity is an integrable
system, making powerful tools available. Here a transformation is constructed
at the cylindrically symmetric level which maps the main initial data to new
data forming a Poisson algebra for which an exact deformation quantization is
known. (Although an auxiliary condition on the data has been quantized only in
the asymptotically flat case, and a suitable representation of the algebra of
quantum data by operators on a Hilbert space has not yet been found.) The
definition of the new main data generalizes naturally to arbitrary,

simplicity. The corresponding generalization of the quantization is however
ambiguous and requires further analysis.

complex and unknown dependence structures among variables. In analyzing such

performing variable reduction on the set of hypotheses prior to testing. We
present in this paper an approach using data-adaptive multiple testing that
serves exactly this purpose. This approach applies data mining techniques to
screen the full set of covariates on equally sized partitions of the whole
sample via cross-validation. This generalized screening procedure is used to
create average ranks for covariates, which are then used to generate a reduced

subsequently subjected to standard multiple testing corrections. The principal
advantage of this methodology lies in its providing valid statistical inference

  Erasure Channel",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, error correcting codes in the erasure channel have drawn great
attention for various applications such as distributed storage systems and
wireless sensor networks, but many of their decoding algorithms are not
practical because they have higher decoding complexity and longer delay. Thus,
the automorphism group decoder (AGD) for cyclic codes in the erasure channel
was introduced, which has good erasure decoding performance with low decoding
complexity. In this paper, we propose new two-stage AGDs (TS-AGDs) for cyclic
codes in the erasure channel by modifying the parity check matrix and
introducing the preprocessing stage to the AGD scheme. The proposed TS-AGD has
been analyzed for the perfect codes, BCH codes, and maximum distance separable
(MDS) codes. Through numerical analysis, it is shown that the proposed decoding
algorithm has good erasure decoding performance with lower decoding complexity
and delay than the conventional AGD. For some cyclic codes, it is shown that
the proposed TS-AGD achieves the perfect decoding in the erasure channel, that
is, the same decoding performance as the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. For
MDS codes, TS-AGDs with the expanded parity check matrix and the submatrix
inversion are also proposed and analyzed.

distributions. The inverse transform sampling (ITS) method is one of the most
popular direct sampling methods. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a
direct sampling algorithm that supersedes the binary-search ITS method (which
is an improvement of the ITS method with binary search). The proposed algorithm
is based on binarizing the support set of the target distribution. Thus, the
proposed algorithm is referred to as binary sampling (BS). The BS algorithm
consists of two procedures: backward binary sampling (BBS) and forward binary
sampling (FBS). The BBS procedure draws a single sample (the first sample) from
the target distribution while constructing a one-way random walk on a binary
tree for the FBS procedure. By running the random walk, the FBS procedure
generates the second and subsequent samples. The BBS and FBS procedures have
$O(N)$ and $O(\ln N)$ time complexities, respectively, and they also have
$O(N)$ space complexity, where $N+1$ is the cardinality of the support set of
the target distribution. Therefore, the time and space complexities of the BS
algorithm are equivalent to those of the standard (possibly best) binary-search
ITS algorithm. However, the BS algorithm has two advantages over the standard
binary-search ITS algorithm. First, the BBS procedure is parallelizable and
thus the total running time of the BS algorithm can be reduced. Second, the BS
algorithm is more accurate in terms of relative rounding error that influences
generated samples.

fluctuations, resulting in a series of stochastic chemical reactions, leading
to corruption of the signal by noise. For example, information flow is
initiated by binding of extracellular ligands to receptors, which is
transmitted through a {cascade involving} kinase-phosphatase stochastic
chemical reactions. For a class of such networks, we develop a general
field-theoretic approach in order to calculate the error in signal transmission
as a function of an appropriate control variable. Application of the theory to
a simple push-pull network, a module in the kinase-phosphatase cascade,
recovers the exact results for error in signal transmission previously obtained
using umbral calculus (Phys. Rev. X., {\bf 4}, 041017 (2014)). We illustrate
the generality of the theory by studying the minimal errors in noise reduction
in a reaction cascade with two connected push-pull modules. Such a cascade
behaves as an effective {three-species} network with a pseudo intermediate. In
this case, optimal information transfer, resulting in the smallest square of
the error between the input and output, occurs with a time delay, which is
given by the inverse of the decay rate of the pseudo intermediate. There are
substantial deviations between simulations and predictions of the linear theory
in error in signal propagation in an enzymatic push-pull network for a certain
range of parameters. Inclusion of second order perturbative corrections shows
that differences between simulations and theoretical predictions are minimized.
Our study establishes that {a} field theoretic formulation {of} stochastic

the photon beam energy is $\sim 0.94$ GeV and the scattered proton is detected
at $\sim 0^\circ$, for the purpose of determining the $\eta$-nucleon scattering
length ($a_{\eta N}$) and effective range ($r_{\eta N}$). In this kinematics,
the $\eta$-nucleon elastic rescattering is significantly enhanced while other

convoluted with the proton momentum distribution in the deuteron, has a very
good resolving power of $a_{\eta N}$ and $r_{\eta N}$. We conclude that the $R$

can determine ${\rm Re}[a_{\eta N}]$ (${\rm Re}[r_{\eta N}]$) at the precision

polariton lasing has been demonstrated in a few inorganic and organic
semiconductors in both low and room temperatures. Polariton lasing in inorganic
materials significantly relies on sophisticated epitaxial growth of crystalline
gain medium layers sandwiched by two distributed Bragg reflectors in which
combating the built-in strain and mismatched thermal properties is nontrivial.
On the other hand, organic active media usually suffer from large threshold
density and weak nonlinearity due to the Frenkel exciton nature. Further
development of polariton lasing towards technologically significant
applications demand more accessible materials, ease of device fabrication and
broadly tunable emission at room temperature. Herein, we report the
experimental realization of room-temperature polariton lasing based on an
epitaxy-free all-inorganic cesium lead chloride perovskite microcavity.
Polariton lasing is unambiguously evidenced by a superlinear power dependence,
macroscopic ground state occupation, blueshift of ground state emission,
narrowing of the linewidth and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence.
Our work suggests considerable promise of lead halide perovskites towards
large-area, low-cost, high performance room temperature polariton devices and
coherent light sources extending from the ultraviolet to near infrared range.

candidates to precious platinum for catalyzing electrochemical hydrogen (HER)
production from water. Within this context, it is natural to consider whether
or not the DNLs are a good candidate for the HER because its non-trivial
surface states provide a robust platform to activate possibly chemical
reactions. Here, through first-principles calculations we reported on a new DNL
TiSi-type family with a closed Dirac nodal line consisting of the linear band
crossings in the $k_y$ = 0 plane. The hydrogen adsorption on the (010) and

charge carries have been revealed to participate in this HER. The results are
highlighting that TiSi not only is a promising catalyst for the HER but also
paves a new routine to design topological quantum catalyst utilizing the

model scenarios. Such a spectrum naturally arises in the minimal universal
extra dimension framework and also in supersymmetric scenarios. Low $p_T$
leptons and jets are characteristic features of such situations. Hence, a
monojet with $\not E_T$ has been the conventional signal at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). However, we stress that inclusion of $p_T$-binned track
observables from such soft objects provide very efficient discrimination of new
physics signals against various SM backgrounds. We consider two benchmark
points each for minimal universal extra dimension (MUED) and minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) scenarios. We perform a detailed cut-based
and multivariate analysis (MVA) to show that the new physics parameter space
can be probed in the ongoing run of LHC at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy with an
integrated luminosity $\sim$ 20-50 fb$^{-1}$. When studied in conjunction with
the dark matter relic density constraint assuming standard cosmology, we find
that compressed MUED (with $\Lambda R=2$) can be already excluded from the
existing data. Also, MVA turns out to be a better technique than regular
cut-based analysis since tracks provide uncorrelated observables which would
extract more information from an event.

framework based on recurrent neural network. Basically, the characteristic of
the vehicle's trajectory is different from that of regular moving objects since
it is affected by various latent factors including road structure, traffic
rules, and driver's intention. Previous state of the art approaches use
sophisticated vehicle behavior model describing these factors and derive the
complex trajectory prediction algorithm, which requires a system designer to
conduct intensive model optimization for practical use. Our approach is
data-driven and simple to use in that it learns complex behavior of the
vehicles from the massive amount of trajectory data through deep neural network
model. The proposed trajectory prediction method employs the recurrent neural
network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to analyze the temporal behavior
and predict the future coordinate of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed
scheme feeds the sequence of vehicles' coordinates obtained from sensor
measurements to the LSTM and produces the probabilistic information on the
future location of the vehicles over occupancy grid map. The experiments
conducted using the data collected from highway driving show that the proposed
method can produce reasonably good estimate of future trajectory.

(Svalgaard & Schatten [2016]). Unfortunately, we cannot support any of the
concerns they raise. We first show that almost always there is simple
proportionality between the group counts by different observers and that taking
the small, occasional, non-linearities into account makes very little
difference. Among other examples: we verify that the RGO group count was
drifting the first twenty years of observations. We then show that our group
count matches the diurnal variation of the geomagnetic field with high
fidelity, and that the heliospheric magnetic field derived from geomagnetic
data is consistent with our group number series. We evaluate the 'correction
matrix' approach [Usoskin et al. 2016] and show that it fails to reproduce the
observational data. We clarify the notion of daisy-chaining and point out that
our group number series has no daisy-chaining for the period 1794-1996 and
therefore no accumulation of errors over that span. We compare with the cosmic
ray record for the last 400+ years and find good agreement. We note that the
Active Day Fraction method (of Usoskin et al.) has the fundamental problem that
at sunspot maximum, every day is an 'active day' so ADF is nearly always unity
and thus does not carry information about the statistics of high solar
activity. This 'information shadow' occurs for even moderate group numbers and
thus need to be extrapolated to higher activity. The ADF method also fails for
'equivalent observers' who should register the same group counts, but do not.
We conclude that the criticism of Svalgaard & Schatten [2016] is invalid and
detrimental to progress in the important field of long-term variation of solar
activity.

flows in which link failures can be mitigated by rerouting the affected flow.
Given a capacitated network, a path flow is reroutable if after failure of an
arbitrary arc, we can reroute the interrupted flow from the tail of that arc to
the sink, without modifying the flow that is not affected by the failure.
Similar types of restoration, which are often termed ""local"", were previously
investigated in the context of network design, such as min-cost capacity
planning. In this paper, our interest is in computing maximum flows under this
robustness assumption. An important new feature of our model, distinguishing it
from existing max robust flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the
network.
  We also study a tightening of reroutable flows, called strictly reroutable
flows, making more restrictive assumptions on the capacities available for
rerouting. For both variants, we devise a reroutable-flow equivalent of an
s-t-cut and show that the corresponding max flow/min cut gap is bounded by 2.
It turns out that a strictly reroutable flow of maximum value can be found
using a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum
reroutable flow is NP-hard, even when all capacities are in {1, 2}. However,
the tightening can be used to get a 2-approximation for reroutable flows. This
ratio is tight in general networks, but we show that in the case of unit
capacities, every reroutable flow can be transformed into a strictly reroutable
flow of same value. While it is NP-hard to compute a maximal integral flow even
for unit capacities, we devise a surprisingly simple combinatorial algorithm
that finds a half-integral strictly reroutable flow of value 1, or certifies
that no such solutions exits. Finally, we also give a hardness result for the
case of multiple arc failures.

units with a complex organization. The interplay between structural patterns
and dynamics might induce functional clusters that, in general, are different
from topological ones. In biological systems, like the human brain, the overall
functionality is often favored by the interplay between connectivity and
synchronization dynamics, with functional clusters that do not coincide with
anatomical modules in most cases. In social, socio-technical and engineering
systems, the quest for consensus favors the emergence of clusters.
  Despite the unquestionable evidence for mesoscale organization of many
complex systems and the heterogeneity of their inter-connectivity, a way to
predict and identify the emergence of functional modules in collective
phenomena continues to elude us. Here, we propose an approach based on random
walk dynamics to define the diffusion distance between any pair of units in a
networked system. Such a metric allows to exploit the underlying diffusion
geometry to provide a unifying framework for the intimate relationship between
metastable synchronization, consensus and random search dynamics in complex
networks, pinpointing the functional mesoscale organization of synthetic and
biological systems.

this atom rearrangement, how to pair atoms with the target sites is a
combinatorial optimization problem: brute-force methods search all possible

between two sets of data while considering their complex properties described
in multiple attributes. However, the information of multiple attributes is
likely to be oversimplified during a process that makes an integrated
attribute, and this degrades the matching accuracy. For that reason, a
multi-layer graph structure-based algorithm has been proposed recently. It can
effectively avoid the problem by separating attributes into multiple layers.
Nonetheless, there are several remaining issues such as a scalability problem
caused by the huge matrix to describe the multi-layer structure and a
back-projection problem caused by the continuous relaxation of the quadratic
assignment problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attributed graph
matching algorithm based on the multi-layer graph factorization. We reformulate
the problem to be solved with several small matrices that are obtained by
factorizing the multi-layer structure. Then, we solve the problem using a
convex-concave relaxation procedure for the multi-layer structure. The proposed
algorithm exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms based on
the single-layer structure.

shown its remarkable performance to generate a feature enhanced high resolution
image, in which a sparsity-inducing regularizer is involved by exploiting the
sparsity priors of some visual features in the underlying image. However, since
the simple prior of low level features are insufficient to describe different
semantic contents in the image, this type of regularizer will be incapable of
distinguishing between the target of interest and unconcerned background
clutters. As a consequence, the features belonging to the target and clutters
are simultaneously affected in the generated image without concerning their
underlying semantic labels. To address this problem, we propose a novel
semantic information guided framework for target oriented SAR image formation,
which aims at enhancing the interested target scatters while suppressing the
background clutters. Firstly, we develop a new semantics-specific regularizer
for image formation by exploiting the statistical properties of different
semantic categories in a target scene SAR image. In order to infer the semantic
label for each pixel in an unsupervised way, we moreover induce a novel
high-level prior-driven regularizer and some semantic causal rules from the
prior knowledge. Finally, our regularized framework for image formation is
further derived as a simple iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization
problem which can be conveniently solved by many off-the-shelf solvers.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
framework for SAR image formation in terms of target enhancement and clutters
suppression, compared with the state of the arts. Additionally, the proposed
framework opens a new direction of devoting some machine learning strategies to
image formation, which can benefit the subsequent decision making tasks.

stochastic background of GWs is an important next step, and the first GW event
suggests that it is within the reach of the second-generation ground-based GW
detectors. Such a GW signal is typically tiny, and can be detected by
cross-correlating the data from two spatially separated detectors if the
detector noise is uncorrelated. It has been advocated, however, that the global
magnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity produce the environmental
disturbances at low-frequency bands, known as Schumann resonances, which
potentially couple with GW detectors. In this paper, we present a simple
analytical model to estimate its impact on the detection of stochastic GWs. The
model crucially depends on the geometry of the detector pair through the
directional coupling, and we investigate the basic properties of the correlated
magnetic noise based on the analytic expressions. The model reproduces the
major trend of the recently measured global correlation between the GW
detectors via magnetometer. The estimated values of the impact of correlated
noise also match those obtained from the measurement. Finally, we give an
implication to the detection of stochastic GWs including upcoming detectors,
KAGRA and LIGO India. The model suggests that LIGO Hanford-Virgo and
Virgo-KAGRA pairs are possibly less sensitive to the correlated noise, and can

aligned structures, which has a profound influence on the flow behavior.
However, the precise role of the microstructure in the development of the
rheological response has not been reliably quantified. We investigate the
self-assembly of dipolar colloids in simple shear using hybrid molecular
dynamics and multi-particle collision dynamics simulations with explicit
coarse-grained hydrodynamics; conduct simulated rheometric studies and apply
micromechanical models to produce master curves, showing evidence of the
universality of the structural behavior governed by the competition of the
bonding (dipolar) and erosive (thermal and/or hydrodynamic) stresses. The
simulations display viscosity changes across several orders of magnitude in
fair quantitative agreement with various literature sources, substantiating the
universality of the approach, which seems to apply generally across vastly
different length scales and a broad range of physical systems.

perform uncertainty, sensitivity, optimization and robustness analyses. A
widely accepted method to circumvent this problem consists in replacing
cpu-time expensive computer models by cpu inexpensive mathematical functions,
called metamodels. For example, the Gaussian process (Gp) model has shown
strong capabilities to solve practical problems , often involving several
interlinked issues. However, in case of high dimensional experiments (with
typically several tens of inputs), the Gp metamodel building process remains
difficult, even unfeasible, and application of variable selection techniques
cannot be avoided. In this paper, we present a general methodology allowing to
build a Gp metamodel with large number of inputs in a very efficient manner.
While our work focused on the Gp metamodel, its principles are fully generic
and can be applied to any types of metamodel. The objective is twofold:
estimating from a minimal number of computer experiments a highly predictive
metamodel. This methodology is successfully applied on an industrial computer
code.

  Rates for Enabling Low-Latency Services","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the detailed queueing behavior of a networking session is
critical in enabling low-latency services over the Internet. Especially when
the packet arrival and service rates at the queue of a link vary over time and
moreover when the session is short-lived, analyzing the corresponding queue
behavior as a function of time, which involves a transient analysis, becomes
extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose and develop a new analytical
framework that anatomizes the transient queue behavior under time-varying
arrival and service rates even under unstable conditions. Our framework is
capable of answering key questions in designing low-latency services such as
the time-dependent probability distribution of the queue length; the
instantaneous or time-averaged violation probability that the queue length
exceeds a certain threshold; and the fraction of time during an interval $[0,
t]$ at which the queue length exceeds a certain threshold. We validate our
framework by comparing its prediction results over time with the statistical
simulation results and confirm that our analysis is accurate enough. Our
extensive demonstrations on the efficacy of the analytical framework in
designing low-latency services reveal that its prediction ability for the
transient queue behavior in diverse time-varying packet arrival and service
patterns can be of a high practical value.

The results for rate constants have been obtained by using Green's function. In
this model, the rate constants for end-to-end looping of polymer exhibits
simple Arrhenius behavior. The rate constants are sensitive to relaxation time,
bond length and chain length dependence of the looping probability. In
particular, for short term rate constant, relaxation time makes loop formation
between two ends of a polymer chain slower but has a direct dependence with
long term rate constant. We also show that for shorter polymer strands looping
is slower as compared to polymer having longer chain length. The long term rate
constant shows inverse square root dependence on the length of the chain. The

increases on cooling, similar to a Schottky-like anomaly for canonical spin

to the phase transition to a quadrupolar state, which contributes to a
relatively large change in entropy, $S \simeq 2.7$ J K$^{-1}$mol$^{-1}$.
However, it is still smaller than $R\ln2$ for the ground state doublet of the

interatomic bonding character. As a matter of course, anisotropic $\kappa$ were
obtained for all the considered materials, owing to anisotropy in phonon group

in $\kappa$ of P, As, and Sb is significant. The results corresponding to the

them with the same group elements. For instance, the room temperature $\kappa$

component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus
on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select
the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (\ie the
correct one) and the decoys (\ie the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis
of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human

by this, we propose automatic procedures to remedy such design deficiencies. We
apply the procedures to re-construct decoy answers for two popular Visual QA
datasets as well as to create a new Visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome
project, resulting in the largest dataset for this task. Extensive empirical
studies show that the design deficiencies have been alleviated in the remedied

(MVNOs) can develop new services on a low-cost platform by leasing virtual
resources from mobile network owners. In this paper, we investigate a two-stage
spectrum leasing framework, where an MVNO acquires radio spectrum through both
advance reservation and on-demand request. To maximize its surplus, the MVNO
jointly optimizes the amount of spectrum to lease in the two stages by taking
into account the traffic distribution, random user locations, wireless channel
statistics, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and the prices differences.
Meanwhile, the acquired spectrum resources are dynamically allocated to the
MVNO's mobile subscribers (users) according to fast channel fadings in order to
maximize the utilization of the resources. The MVNO's surplus maximization
problem is naturally formulated as a tri-level nested optimization problem that
consists of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), on-demand request, and advance
reservation subproblems. To solve the problem efficiently, we rigorously
analyze the structure of the optimal solution in the DRA problem, and the
optimal value is used to find the optimal leasing decisions in the two stages.
In particular, we derive closed-form expressions of the optimal advance
reservation and on-demand requests when the proportional fair utility function
is adopted. We further extend the analysis to general utility functions and
derive a Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) algorithm to find the optimal leasing
decisions. Simulation results show that the two-stage spectrum leasing strategy
can take advantage of both the price discount of advance reservation and the
flexibility of on-demand request to deal with traffic variations.

(excluding those with supergiant primaries) in the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey
(VFTS). Projected rotational velocities, $v$sin$i$, for the primaries have been
estimated using a Fourier Transform technique and confirmed by fitting
rotationally broadened profiles. A subset of 33 systems with $v$sin$i$$\leq$ 80
km/s have been analysed using a TLUSTY grid of model atmospheres to estimate
stellar parameters and surface abundances for the primaries. The effects of a
potential flux contribution from an unseen secondary have also been considered.
For 20 targets it was possible to reliably estimate their effective
temperatures (T$_{eff}$) but for the other 13 objects it was only possible to
provide a constraint of 20,000$\leq$T$_{eff}$$\leq$26,000 K -- the other
parameters estimated for these targets will be consequently less reliable. The
estimated stellar properties are compared with evolutionary models and are
generally consistent with their membership of 30 Doradus, while the nature of
the secondaries of 3 SB2 system is discussed. A comparison with a sample of
single stars with $v$sin$i$$\leq$ 80 km/s obtained from the VFTS and analysed
with the same techniques implies that the atmospheric parameters and nitrogen
abundances of the two samples are similar. However, the binary sample may have
a lack of primaries with significant nitrogen enhancements, which would be
consistent with them having low rotational velocities and having effectively
evolved as single stars without significant rotational mixing. This result,

Independent Set in the LOCAL model, so that it works in the significantly
weaker BEEP model. For networks with maximum degree $\Delta$, our algorithm
terminates locally within time $O((\log \Delta + \log (1/\epsilon)) \cdot
\log(1/\epsilon))$, with probability at least $1 - \epsilon$. The key idea of
the modification is to replace explicit messages about transmission
probabilities with estimates based on the number of received messages.
  After the successful introduction (and implicit use) of local analysis, e.g.,
by Barenboim et al. [JACM'16], Chung et al. [PODC'14], Ghaffari [SODA'16], and
Halldorsson et al. [PODC'15], we study this concept in the BEEP model for the
first time.
  By doing so, we improve over local bounds that are implicitly derived from
previous work (that uses traditional global analysis) on computing a Maximal
Independent Set in the \beep model for a large range of values of the parameter
$\Delta$. At the same time, we show that our algorithm in the \beep model only
needs to pay a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor in the runtime compared to the best
known MIS algorithm in the much more powerful \local model. We demonstrate that
this overhead is negligible, as communication via beeps can be implemented
using significantly less resources than communication in the LOCAL model. In
particular, when looking at implementing these models, one round of the \local
model needs at least $O(\Delta)$ time units, while one round in the BEEP model
needs $O(\log\Delta)$ time units, an improvement that diminishes the loss of a
$\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor in most settings.

we provide an explanation for the appearance of this increase of ""non-uniform""

that accompany the electric field variations termed Seismic Electric Signals
(SES) activity which have been repeatedly reported that precede major
earthquakes. DFA as well as multifractal DFA reveal that the latter electric
field variations exhibit scaling behavior as shown by analyzing SES activities
observed before major earthquakes in Greece. Hence, when these variations are
superimposed on a background of pseudosinusoidal trend, their long range
correlation properties -quantified by DFA- are affected resulting in an
increase of the ""non-uniform"" scaling behavior. The same is expected to hold
for the former magnetic field variations.

thus pointing to the initiation at that date of a strong precursory Seismic
Electric Signals activity accompanied by the anomalous geomagnetic field
variations. Starting from this date, natural time analysis of the subsequent
seismicity indicates that a strong mainshock was expected in a few days to one

  We investigate two cases: when the whole clusters are separated by some gap

  We overcome a major obstacle in using clusterability criteria due to the fact
that known approaches to clusterability checking had the disadvantage that they
are related to the optimal clustering which is NP hard to identify.
  Compared to other approaches to clusterability, the novelty consists in the
possibility of an a posteriori (after running $k$-means) check if the data set
is well-clusterable or not. As the $k$-means algorithm applied for this purpose
has polynomial complexity so does therefore the appropriate check.
Additionally, if $k$-means++ fails to identify a clustering that meets
clusterability criteria, with high probability the data is not
well-clusterable.

Recently, the Multipath Transport Control Protocol (MPTCP) extension was
standardized and is undergoing a quick adoption in many use-cases, from mobile
to fixed access networks, from data-centers to core networks. Among its major
benefits -- i.e., reliability thanks to backup path rerouting; throughput
increase thanks to link aggregation; and confidentiality thanks to harder
capacity to intercept a full connection -- the latter has attracted lower
attention. How interesting would it be using MPTCP to exploit multiple
Internet-scale paths hence decreasing the probability of man-in-the-middle

show a higher level of robustness against MITM AS-level attacks, for example
due to core cable tapping or route hijacking practices.

statistical knowledge of direction angle measurement errors is unavailable, a
novel robust beamforming scheme of combining main-lobe-integration (MLI) and
leakage is proposed to simultaneously transmit multiple different independent
parallel confidential message streams to the associated multiple distinct
desired users. The proposed scheme includes two steps: designing the
beamforming vectors of the useful confidential messages and constructing
artificial noise (AN) projection matrix. Here, in its first step, the
beamforming vectors for the useful confidential messages of desired user k are
given by minimizing the useful signal power leakage from main-lobe of desired
user k to the sum of main-lobes of the remaining desired directions plus
main-lobes of all eavesdropper directions. In its second step, the AN
projection matrix is constructed by simultaneously maximizing the AN power
leakage to all eavesdropper directions such that all eavesdroppers are
disrupted seriously, where AN is viewed by the transmitter as a useful signal
for eavedroppers. Due to independent beamforming vectors for different desired
users, a more secure transmission is achieved. Compared with conventional
non-robust methods, the proposed method can provide a significant improvement
in bit error rate along the desired directions and secrecy-sum-rate towards
multiple desired users without needing statistical property or distribution of

imaging capability. However, the RS cameras suffer from undesirable artifacts
when the camera or the subject is moving, or illumination condition changes.
For that reason, Monocular Visual Odometry (MVO) with RS cameras produces
inaccurate ego-motion estimates. Previous works solve this RS distortion
problem with motion prediction from images and/or inertial sensors. However,
the MVO still has trouble in handling the RS distortion when the camera motion
changes abruptly (e.g. vibration of mobile cameras causes extremely fast motion
instantaneously). To address the problem, we propose the novel MVO algorithm in
consideration of the geometric characteristics of RS cameras. The key idea of
the proposed algorithm is the new RS essential matrix which incorporates the
instantaneous angular and linear velocities at each frame. Our algorithm
produces accurate and robust ego-motion estimates in an online manner, and is
applicable to various mobile applications with RS cameras. The superiority of
the proposed algorithm is validated through quantitative and qualitative
comparison on both synthetic and real dataset.

background spectrum at 0.8-1.7 um from the CIBER experiment. The observations
were obtained with an absolute spectrometer over two flights in multiple sky
fields to enable the subtraction of Zodiacal light, stars, terrestrial
emission, and diffuse Galactic light. After subtracting foregrounds and
accounting for systematic errors, we find the nominal EBL brightness, assuming
the Kelsall Zodiacal light model, is 42.7+11.9/-10.6 nW/m2/sr at 1.4 um. We
also analyzed the data using the Wright Zodiacal light model, which results in
a worse statistical fit to the data and an unphysical EBL, falling below the
known background light from galaxies at <1.3 um. Using a model-independent
analysis based on the minimum EBL brightness, we find an EBL brightness of
28.7+5.1/-3.3 nW/m2/sr at 1.4 um. While the derived EBL amplitude strongly
depends on the Zodiacal light model, we find that we cannot fit the spectral

galactic light from galaxy counts. The results require a new diffuse component,
such as an additional foreground or an excess EBL with a redder spectrum than
that of Zodiacal light.

equivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an
isomorphism between the graded algebras that maps each graded component onto a

behavioral trends emerging in the whole network, as well as the individual
characterization of specific nodes. We also perform a cluster analysis, which
reveals that, in all three networks, one can distinguish two types of nodes

obtained using nonstationary Gabor frames (NSGFs). NSGFs generalize classical
Gabor frames by allowing for adaptivity in either time or frequency. It is
known that the concept of painless nonorthogonal expansions generalizes to the
nonstationary case, providing perfect reconstruction and an FFT based
implementation for compactly supported window functions sampled at a certain
density. It is also known that for some signal classes, NSGFs with flexible
time resolution tend to provide sparser expansions than can be obtained with
classical Gabor frames. In this article we show, for the continuous case, that
sparseness of a nonstationary Gabor expansion is equivalent to smoothness in an
associated decomposition space. In this way we characterize signals with sparse
expansions relative to NSGFs with flexible time resolution. Based on this
characterization we prove an upper bound on the approximation error occurring
when thresholding the coefficients of the corresponding frame expansions. We
complement the theoretical results with numerical experiments, estimating the
rate of approximation obtained from thresholding the coefficients of both
stationary and nonstationary Gabor expansions.

security of currently used classical schemes relies on computational
assumptions. Quantum digital signatures (QDS), on the other hand, provide
information-theoretic security based on the laws of quantum physics. Recent
work on QDS shows that such schemes do not require trusted quantum channels and
are unconditionally secure against general coherent attacks. However, in
practical QDS, just as in quantum key distribution (QKD), the detectors can be
subjected to side-channel attacks, which can make the actual implementations
insecure. Motivated by the idea of measurement-device-independent quantum key
distribution (MDI-QKD), we present a measurement-device-independent QDS
(MDI-QDS) scheme, which is secure against all detector side-channel attacks.
Based on the rapid development of practical MDI-QKD, our MDI-QDS protocol could
also be experimentally implemented, since it requires a similar experimental

finding suggests that IgReC may alleviate the need to generate repertoires
using the barcoding technology (the workhorse of current immunogenomics

immunosequencing data ends up being nearly as powerful as the experimental

  We present a new framework for automating the process of discovering filtered

system applies information retrieval algorithms to isolate characteristic
linguistic patterns in known filtered web pages; these are then used as the
basis for web search queries. The results of these queries are then checked for

into the system to detect further filtered content.
  Our implementation of this framework, applied to China as a case study, shows
that this approach is demonstrably effective at detecting significant numbers
of previously unknown filtered web pages, making a significant contribution to
the ongoing detection of internet filtering as it develops.
  Our tool is currently deployed and has been used to discover 1355 domains
that are poisoned within China as of Feb 2017 - 30 times more than are
contained in the most widely-used public filter list. Of these, 759 are outside
of the Alexa Top 1000 domains list, demonstrating the capability of this

further insight into the nature of the content currently being blocked in

insulating phase. The strong-coupling results for the ground-state energy, the
single-particle excitation energies, and the momentum distribution functions up
to 6th order in hopping are benchmarked against the numerically exact
(infinite) density-matrix renormalization group technique. Since these analytic
expressions are valid for any fractional phase $\theta$ of anyons, they will be
of great value for a sufficiently reliable analysis of future experiments,
avoiding extensive and costly numerical simulations.

in the coupling between mirrors and field, of the corresponding effective
action, which is used to compute the particle creation rate. The amplitude of
the oscillation is not necessarily small. We first obtain results for a single
mirror, both for non-relativistic and relativistic motions, showing that only
for the latter the effects may be significant. For two mirrors, on the other
hand, we show that there are interesting interference effects, and that in some
particular cases the results differ from those obtained assuming small
amplitudes, already for non-relativistic motions.

challenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology
modeling. Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light
on protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but
DCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses
information only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep
transfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction
by learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from
thousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs,
our deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact
prediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63)
and much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11
winner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further
improved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts
in transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range
accuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by
non-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV
(0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure
relationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP
contact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better
contact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our
deep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore>0.6 when
trained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while
CCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our
contact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling.

expansion of the universe and inflationary behaviour at later times. To this
end, an infinite derivative extension of relativity is introduced, with the
gravitational action derived and the non-linear field equations calculated,
before being linearised around both Minkowski space and de Sitter space. The
theory is then constrained so as to avoid ghosts and tachyons by appealing to
the modified propagator, which is also derived. Finally, the Raychaudhuri
Equation is employed in order to describe the ghost-free, defocusing behaviour
around both Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes, in the linearised regime.

security mechanisms and protocols tailored for this domain, addressing both
security and privacy. Typically, the security analysis of these proposals has
largely been informal. However, formal analysis can be used to expose flaws and
ultimately provide a higher level of assurance in the protocols.
  This paper focusses on the formal analysis of a particular element of
security mechanisms for V2X found in many proposals: the revocation of
malicious or misbehaving vehicles from the V2X system by invalidating their
credentials. This revocation needs to be performed in an unlinkable way for
vehicle privacy even in the context of vehicles regularly changing their
pseudonyms. The REWIRE scheme by Forster et al. and its subschemes BASIC and
RTOKEN aim to solve this challenge by means of cryptographic solutions and
trusted hardware.
  Formal analysis using the TAMARIN prover identifies two flaws with some of
the functional correctness and authentication properties in these schemes. We
then propose Obscure Token (OTOKEN), an extension of REWIRE to enable
revocation in a privacy preserving manner. Our approach addresses the
functional and authentication properties by introducing an additional key-pair,
which offers a stronger and verifiable guarantee of successful revocation of
vehicles without resolving the long-term identity. Moreover OTOKEN is the first
V2X revocation protocol to be co-designed with a formal model.

the signal of a response as a sum of functions of covariates of relatively low

additive regression where functional semi-norms are used to induce smoothness
of component functions and the empirical $L_2$ norm is used to induce sparsity.
The functional semi-norms can be of Sobolev or bounded variation types and are
allowed to be different amongst individual component functions. We establish
new oracle inequalities for the predictive performance of such methods under
three simple technical conditions: a sub-gaussian condition on the noise, a
compatibility condition on the design and the functional classes under
consideration, and an entropy condition on the functional classes. For random
designs, the sample compatibility condition can be replaced by its population
version under an additional condition to ensure suitable convergence of
empirical norms. In homogeneous settings where the complexities of the
component functions are of the same order, our results provide a spectrum of
explicit convergence rates, from the so-called slow rate without requiring the
compatibility condition to the fast rate under the hard sparsity or certain
$L_q$ sparsity to allow many small components in the true regression function.

associated with the violent death of a very massive star. They are thus
believed to originate within regions of recent or ongoing star formation with
various bright, young stars, for instance, OB associations. GRBs have been
detected in gamma-rays by satellite-borne gamma-ray telescopes at MeV - GeV
energies, but could potentially also emit gamma-rays at even higher energies
(Very-High-Energy [VHE] gamma-rays: E > 100 GeV), as observed by ground-based
Cherenkov Telescope facilities, such as the High Energy Stereoscopic System

pair production, and the stars in the vicinity of a GRB provide a dense
radiation environment, which could lead to such absorption. We have
investigated representative GRB environments and provide an estimate of the
opacity to gamma-gamma absorption for VHE gamma-rays from GRBs. We find that

gamma-gamma absorption is expected to be negligible.

reliable systems, and the Erlang programming language has a well-established
and influential model. While Erlang model conceptually provides reliable
scalability, it has some inherent scalability limits and these force developers
to depart from the model at scale. This article establishes the scalability
limits of Erlang systems, and reports the work to improve the language
scalability.
  We systematically study the scalability limits of Erlang and address the
issues at the virtual machine (VM), language, and tool levels. More
specifically: (1) We have evolved the Erlang VM so that it can work effectively
in large scale single-host multicore and NUMA architectures. We have made
important architectural improvements to the Erlang/OTP. (2) We have designed
and implemented Scalable Distributed (SD) Erlang libraries to address
language-level scalability issues, and provided and validated a set of
semantics for the new language constructs. (3) To make large Erlang systems
easier to deploy, monitor, and debug we have developed and made open source
releases of five complementary tools, some specific to SD Erlang.
  Throughout the article we use two case studies to investigate the
capabilities of our new technologies and tools: a distributed hash table based
Orbit calculation and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO). Chaos Monkey experiments
show that two versions of ACO survive random process failure and hence that SD
Erlang preserves the Erlang reliability model. Even for programs with no global
recovery data to maintain, SD Erlang partitions the network to reduce network
traffic and hence improves performance of the Orbit and ACO benchmarks above 80
hosts. ACO measurements show that maintaining global recovery data dramatically
limits scalability; however scalability is recovered by partitioning the
recovery data.

diversification gains, or only a very limited amount of them. Concerning the
impact of tail dependence, we find the peculiar results that for high tail
dependence levels the limits to diversification are uniformly lower for all the
levels of dependence, and for all levels of $\alpha<2$. The result is confirmed
as we move towards extreme points in the tail: in this case, we show that at
some point in the tail the aggregated VaR becomes additive above some level of

enhancing the X-ray emission in LWFA has been recently proposed and analyzed,
finding an efficient way to use and control these radiation emissions remains
an important problem. Based on analytical estimates and 3D particle-in-cell
simulations, we here propose and examine a new method utilizing two colliding
LWFA patterns with an angle in-between their propagation directions. Varying
the angle of collision, the distance of acceleration before the collision and
other parameters provide an unprecedented control over the emission parameters.
Moreover, we reveal here that for a collision angle of 5$^\circ$, the two
wakefields merge into a single LWFA cavity inducing strong and stable
collective oscillations between the two trapped electron bunches. This results
in an X-ray emission which is strongly peaked, both in the spatial and
frequency domain. The basic concept of the proposed scheme may pave a way for
using LWFA radiation sources in many important applications, such as
phase-contrast radiography.

prevalent research topic. By defining two convolutional neural networks
(G-Network and D-Network) and introducing an adversarial procedure between them
during the training process, GAN has ability to generate good quality images
that look like natural images from a random vector. Besides image generation,
GAN may have potential to deal with wide range of real world problems. In this
paper, we follow the basic idea of GAN and propose a novel model for image
saliency detection, which is called Supervised Adversarial Networks (SAN).
Specifically, SAN also trains two models simultaneously: the G-Network takes
natural images as inputs and generates corresponding saliency maps (synthetic
saliency maps), and the D-Network is trained to determine whether one sample is
a synthetic saliency map or ground-truth saliency map. However, different from
GAN, the proposed method uses fully supervised learning to learn both G-Network
and D-Network by applying class labels of the training set. Moreover, a novel
kind of layer call conv-comparison layer is introduced into the D-Network to
further improve the saliency performance by forcing the high-level feature of
synthetic saliency maps and ground-truthes as similar as possible. Experimental
results on Pascal VOC 2012 database show that the SAN model can generate high
quality saliency maps for many complicate natural images.

requires iterative algorithms to achieve good image quality for reliable
clinical use in practice, at huge computational costs. In this paper, we
consider the PET reconstruction a dense prediction problem where the large
scale contextual information is essential, and propose a novel architecture of
multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks (msfCNN) for fast PET image
reconstruction. The proposed msfCNN gains large receptive fields with both
memory and computational efficiency, by using a downscaling-upscaling structure
and dilated convolutions. Instead of pooling and deconvolution, we propose to
use the periodic shuffling operation from sub-pixel convolution and its inverse
to scale the size of feature maps without losing resolution. Residual
connections were added to improve training. We trained the proposed msfCNN
model with simulated data, and applied it to clinical PET data acquired on a
Siemens mMR scanner. The results from real oncological and neurodegenerative
cases show that the proposed msfCNN-based reconstruction outperforms the
iterative approaches in terms of computational time while achieving comparable
image quality for quantification. The proposed msfCNN model can be applied to
other dense prediction tasks, and fast msfCNN-based PET reconstruction could
facilitate the potential use of molecular imaging in interventional/surgical
procedures, where cancer surgery can particularly benefit.

based merely on the action principle and on the general principle of
relativity. We apply the canonical transformation framework to formulate
geometrodynamics as a gauge theory. The starting point of our paper is
constituted by the general De~Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian of a system of scalar and
vector fields, which is supposed to be form-invariant under (global) Lorentz
transformations. Following the reasoning of gauge theories, the corresponding
locally form-invariant system is worked out by means of canonical
transformations. The canonical transformation approach ensures by construction
that the form of the action functional is maintained. We thus encounter amended
Hamiltonian systems which are form-invariant under arbitrary spacetime
transformations. This amended system complies with the general principle of
relativity and describes both, the dynamics of the given physical system's
fields and their coupling to those quantities which describe the dynamics of
the spacetime geometry. In this way, it is unambiguously determined how spin-0
and spin-1 fields couple to the dynamics of spacetime.
  A term that describes the dynamics of the free gauge fields must finally be
added to the amended Hamiltonian, as common to all gauge theories, to allow for
a dynamic spacetime geometry. The choice of this ""dynamics Hamiltonian"" is
outside of the scope of gauge theory as presented in this paper. It accounts
for the remaining indefiniteness of any gauge theory of gravity and must be
chosen ""by hand"" on the basis of physical reasoning. The final Hamiltonian of
the gauge theory of gravity is shown to be at least quadratic in the conjugate
momenta of the gauge fields -- this is beyond the Einstein-Hilbert theory of
General Relativity.

quantify the effects of stochastic fluctuations that arise due to biomolecular
species with low copy numbers. The CME is a system of ordinary differential
equations that describes the evolution of probability density for each
population vector in the state-space of the stochastic reaction dynamics. For
many examples of interest, this state-space is infinite, making it difficult to
obtain exact solutions of the CME. To deal with this problem, the Finite State
Projection (FSP) algorithm was developed by Munsky and Khammash (Jour. Chem.
Phys. 2006), to provide approximate solutions to the CME by truncating the
state-space. The FSP works well for finite time-periods but it cannot be used
for estimating the stationary solutions of CMEs, which are often of interest in
systems biology. The aim of this paper is to develop a version of FSP which we
refer to as the stationary FSP (sFSP) that allows one to obtain accurate
approximations of the stationary solutions of a CME by solving a finite
linear-algebraic system that yields the stationary distribution of a
continuous-time Markov chain over the truncated state-space. We derive bounds
for the approximation error incurred by sFSP and we establish that under
certain stability conditions, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by
appropriately expanding the truncated state-space. We provide several examples
to illustrate our sFSP method and demonstrate its efficiency in estimating the
stationary distributions. In particular, we show that using a quantised tensor
train (QTT) implementation of our sFSP method, problems admitting more than 100
million states can be efficiently solved.

colloidal inclusions in an active bath of chiral or non-chiral particles, using
Brownian Dynamics simulations within a standard, two-dimensional model of
disk-shaped inclusions and active particles. In a non-chiral active bath, we
first corroborate previous findings on effective two-body repulsion mediated
between the inclusions by elucidating the detailed non-monotonic features of
the two-body force profiles, including a primary maximum, and a secondary hump
at larger separations that was not previously reported. We then show that these
features arise directly from the formation, and sequential overlaps, of
circular layers (or 'rings') of active particles around the inclusions, as the
latter are brought to small surface separations. These rings extend to radial
distances of a few active-particle radii from the surface of inclusions, giving
the hard-core inclusions relatively thick, soft, repulsive 'shoulders', whose
multiple overlaps then enable significant (non-pairwise) three-body forces in
both non-chiral and chiral active baths. The resulting three-body forces can
even exceed the two-body forces in magnitude and display distinct repulsive and
attractive regimes at intermediate to large self-propulsion strengths. In a
chiral active bath, we show that, while active particles still tend to
accumulate at the immediate vicinity of the inclusions, they exhibit strong
depletion from the intervening region between the inclusions, and partial
depletion from relatively thick, circular, zones further away from the
inclusions. In this case, the effective, predominantly repulsive, interactions

or extinct life elsewhere the Solar System. Implicit in much of this work is
that we are looking for microbial or, at best, unintelligent life, even though
technological artifacts might be much easier to find. SETI work on searches for
alien artifacts in the Solar System typically presumes that such artifacts
would be of extrasolar origin, even though life is known to have existed in the
Solar System, on Earth, for eons. But if a prior technological, perhaps
spacefaring, species ever arose in the Solar System, it might have produced
artifacts or other technosignatures that have survived to present day, meaning
Solar System artifact SETI provides a potential path to resolving
astrobiology's question. Here, I discuss the origins and possible locations for
technosignatures of such a $prior$ $indigenous$ $technological$ $species$,
which might have arisen on ancient Earth or another body, such as a
pre-greenhouse Venus or a wet Mars. In the case of Venus, the arrival of its
global greenhouse and potential resurfacing might have erased all evidence of
its existence on the Venusian surface. In the case of Earth, erosion and,
ultimately, plate tectonics may have erased most such evidence if the species
lived Gyr ago. Remaining indigenous technosignatures might be expected to be
extremely old, limiting the places they might still be found to beneath the
surfaces of Mars and the Moon, or in the outer Solar System.

black holes in X-ray binaries (XRBs) are believed to work in a similar way.
While XRBs evolve rapidly and several sources have undergone a few complete
cycles from quiescence to an outburst and back, most AGN remain in the same
state over periods of decades, due to their longer characteristic timescale
proportional to their size. However, the study of the AGN spectral states is
still possible with a large sample of sources. Multi-wavelength observations
are needed for this purpose since the AGN thermal disc emission dominates in
the ultraviolet energy range, while the up-scattered hot-corona emission is
detected in X-rays. We compared simultaneous UV and X-ray measurements of AGN
obtained by the XMM-Newton satellite. The non-thermal flux was constrained from
the 2-12 keV X-ray luminosity, while the thermal disc component was estimated
from the UV flux at 2900A. The hardness (ratio between the X-ray and UV plus
X-ray luminosity) and the total luminosity were used to construct the AGN state
diagrams. For sources with reliable mass measurements, the Eddington ratio was
used instead of the total luminosity. The state diagrams show that the
radio-loud sources have on average higher hardness, due to the lack of the
thermal disc emission in the UV band, and have flatter intrinsic X-ray spectra.
In contrast, the sources with high luminosity and low hardness are radio-quiet
AGN. The hardness-Eddington ratio diagram reveals that the average
radio-loudness is stronger for low-accreting sources, while it decreases when
the accretion rate is close to the Eddington limit. Our results indicate that
the general properties of AGN accretion states are similar to those of X-ray
binaries. This suggests that the AGN radio dichotomy of radio-loud and
radio-quiet sources can be explained by the evolution of the accretion states.

charge, spin and current can be manipulated at cryogenic temperatures. The

for the study of quantum critical phenomena that is characterized by both
space- and time-dependent quantities. In this Key Issues article we aim to
provide a self-contained overview of ferroelectrics near quantum phase

point can be tuned experimentally to reside at, above or below its upper
critical dimension; this feature allows for detailed interplay between
experiment and theory using both scaling and self-consistent field models.
Empirically, the sensitivity of the ferroelectrics $T_c$s to external to
chemical pressure gives practical access to a broad range of temperature
behavior over several hundreds of Kelvin. Additional degrees of freedom like
charge and spin can be added and characterized systematically. Satellite
memories, electrocaloric cooling and low-loss phased-array radar are among

the context of Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC). MLMC is a strategy employed to
compute expectations which can be biased in some sense, for instance, by using
the discretization of a associated probability law. The MLMC approach works
with a hierarchy of biased approximations which become progressively more
accurate and more expensive. Using a telescoping representation of the most
accurate approximation, the method is able to reduce the computational cost for
a given level of error versus i.i.d. sampling from this latter approximation.
All of these ideas originated for cases where exact sampling from couples in
the hierarchy is possible. This article considers the case where such exact
sampling is not currently possible. We consider Markov chain Monte Carlo and
sequential Monte Carlo methods which have been introduced in the literature and
we describe different strategies which facilitate the application of MLMC

well as leakage of the states from the surface to the bulk. Subjecting the
model to a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface results in quantum
oscillations. The oscillations are different from the usual ones since they do
not involve a closed Fermi surface cross section. It has been shown previously
that the Quantum oscillations can be understood semiclassically as resulting
from motion of electrons on the surface Fermi arcs as well as tunneling through
chiral Landau levels associated with the bulk. In this work we develop an
effective surface theory and use it to analyze the quantum oscillation in the
semiclassical regime and beyond. Specifically, we show that when a pair of Weyl
points are close to each other the surface quantum oscillations acquire a phase
offset which originates from the bulk. While the surface states are responsible
for a large part of the electron motion, tunneling through the bulk is
necessary for completing the orbit. This tunneling makes use of the bulk, zero
energy, chiral Landau level in each Weyl node. When the nodes are close in
momentum space their chiral levels overlap and a gap at zero energy is formed.
This gap causes the phase offset in the surface quantum oscillations.

Fokker-Planck equation self-consistently for ion cyclotron range of frequency
waves in a tokamak. The reduced model ensures the important properties of the
full model by Kennel-Engelmann diffusion, such as diffusion directions, wave
polarizations, and H-theorem. The kinetic energy change (W-dot) is used to
derive the reduced model diffusion coefficients for the fundamental damping and
the second harmonic damping to the lowest order of the finite Larmor radius

crossings are encountered. The structural effect of skewness is an additional
torsion on the bridge deck which may have a considerable effect, making its
analysis and design more complex. In this paper, an analytical model following
3D beam theory is firstly derived in order to evaluate the dynamic response of
skew bridges under moving loads. Following, a simplified 2D model is also
considered which includes only vertical beam bending. The natural frequencies,
eigenmodes and orthogonality relationships are determined from the boundary
conditions. The dynamic response is determined in time domain by using the
""exact'"" integration. Both models are validated through some numerical examples
by comparing with the results obtained by 3D FE models. A parametric study is
performed with the simplified model in order to identify parameters that
significantly influence the vertical dynamic response of the skew bridge under
traffic loads. The results show that the grade of skewness has an important
influence on the vertical displacement, but hardly on the vertical acceleration
of the bridge. The torsional stiffness really has effect on the vertical
displacement when the skew angle is large. The span length reduces the skewness
effect on the dynamic behavior of the skew bridge.

This approach can greatly reduce the time required to produce large cluster

in an operational regime where demonstrated collection, coupling and detection
efficiencies are sufficient for generating resource states for universal

high-cooperativity interfaces and ancilla single photons, and can also tolerate

the Intersection over Union (IoU) criterion. To date, most approaches are
restricted to axis-aligned or oriented boxes and, as a consequence, many
datasets are only labeled with boxes. Nevertheless, axis-aligned or oriented
boxes cannot accurately capture an object's shape. To address this, a number of
densely segmented datasets has started to emerge in both the object detection
and the object tracking communities. However, evaluating the accuracy of object
detectors and trackers that are restricted to boxes on densely segmented data
is not straightforward. To close this gap, we introduce the relative
Intersection over Union (rIoU) accuracy measure. The measure normalizes the IoU
with the optimal box for the segmentation to generate an accuracy measure that
ranges between 0 and 1 and allows a more precise measurement of accuracies.
Furthermore, it enables an efficient and easy way to understand scenes and the
strengths and weaknesses of an object detection or tracking approach. We
display how the new measure can be efficiently calculated and present an
easy-to-use evaluation framework. The framework is tested on the DAVIS and the
VOT2016 segmentations and has been made available to the community.

  orientation angle from PolSAR data: An insight into the real and complex
  rotation of the coherency matrix","Unpublished",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The angle of rotation of any target about the radar line of sight (LOS) is
known as the polarization orientation angle. The orientation angle is found to
be non-zero for undulating terrains and man-made targets oriented away from the
radar LOS. This effect is more pronounced at lower frequencies (eg. L- and P-
bands). The orientation angle shift is not only induced by azimuthal slope but
also by range slope. This shift increases the cross-polarization (HV) intensity
and subsequently, the covariance or the coherency matrix becomes reflection
asymmetric. Compensating this orientation angle prior to any model-based
decomposition technique for geophysical parameter estimation or classification
is crucial. In this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate the orientation
angle based on the maximization of the degree of polarization. The proposed
method is then used to infer the change in the degree of polarization with the
associated orientation angle.

insinuate that magnetic monopoles may be almost free in rectangular lattices
with a critical ratio $\gamma = \gamma_{c} = \sqrt{3}$, supporting previous
theoretical predictions.

set of partial indices of a non-singular matrix function may change depending
on the properties of the original matrix. More precisely, it was shown that if
the difference between the larger and the smaller partial indices is larger
than unity then, in any neighborhood of the original matrix function, there
exists another matrix function possessing a different set of partial indices.
As a result, the factorization of matrix functions, being an extremely
difficult process itself even in the case of the canonical factorization,
remains unresolvable or even questionable in the case of a non-stable set of
partial indices. Such a situation, in turn, has became an unavoidable obstacle
to the application of the factorization technique. This paper sets out to
answer a less ambitious question than that of effective factorizing matrix
functions with non-stable sets of partial indices, and instead focuses on
determining the conditions which, when imposed on the original matrix function,
allow to construct another matrix function that exhibits the same partial
indices and is close to the original matrix function.

ingredients found in quantum information theory. One tool to better understand
these notions is the model of nonlocal games; a mathematical framework that
abstractly models a physical system. The simplest instance of a nonlocal game
involves two players, Alice and Bob, who are not allowed to communicate with
each other once the game has started and who play cooperatively against an
adversary referred to as the referee. The focus of this thesis is a class of
games called extended nonlocal games, of which nonlocal games are a subset. In
an extended nonlocal game, the players initially share a tripartite state with
the referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend
on outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared
quantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to the questions sent by
the referee. We build up the framework for extended nonlocal games and study
their properties and how they relate to nonlocal games.

Vallis, Arun Kejariwal","Automatic Anomaly Detection in the Cloud Via Statistical Learning","13 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performance and high availability have become increasingly important drivers,
amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such
as social networks, and web search. Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often
give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high
availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that
service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services,
with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of
anomalies is non-trivial.
  Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection,
existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data,
owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data.
  To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically
detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques
employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system
metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal
components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical
metrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect
anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different
perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning.
In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision,
Recall, and F-measure in each case.

high frequency acoustic and electromagnetic scattering by penetrable
(dielectric) convex polygons. Our method is based on a standard reformulation
of the associated transmission boundary value problem as a direct boundary
integral equation for the unknown Cauchy data, but with a nonstandard numerical
discretization which efficiently captures the high frequency oscillatory
behaviour. The Cauchy data is represented as a sum of the classical geometrical
optics approximation, computed by a beam tracing algorithm, plus a contribution
due to diffraction, computed by a Galerkin boundary element method using
oscillatory basis functions chosen according to the principles of the
Geometrical Theory of Diffraction. We demonstrate with a range of numerical
experiments that our boundary element method can achieve a fixed accuracy of
approximation using only a relatively small, frequency-independent number of
degrees of freedom. Moreover, for the scattering scenarios we consider, the
inclusion of the diffraction term provides an order of magnitude improvement in
accuracy over the geometrical optics approximation alone.

generalization, Li\'enard's formula, widely believed to represent the
instantaneous radiative losses from an accelerated charge, are not compatible
with the special theory of relativity (STR). We demonstrate this in the case of
a charge emitting synchrotron radiation where the agency responsible for
acceleration (the magnetic field) does no work and thus all the energy-momentum
carried by the radiation has to be balanced unambiguously against the kinetic
energy-momentum of the moving charge. The application of the radiation reaction
inferred from Larmor's/Li\'enard's formulas in two different inertial frames,
yields results that are not in conformity with the relativistic
transformations. Further, we show that energy-momentum conservation is violated
in all inertial frames when we try to balance the energy-momentum carried by
the electromagnetic radiation against the loss of kinetic energy and momentum
of the radiating charge in accordance with Larmor's formula. We point out a
mathematical subtlety in the applicability of Poynting's theorem, that seems to
have been overlooked in the text-book derivation of Larmor's formula, where a
proper distinction between ""real"" and ""retarded"" times was not kept, and which
has therefore given rise to such anomalies, including the mysterious Schott
term, which happens to be nothing but the difference in rate of change of
energy in self-fields of the charge between retarded and present times.

describing a previous 1972 falsification of AI by British mathematical
physicist James Lighthill. How Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to
current AI is explained. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian
scientific method in which it is the duty of scientists to attempt to falsify
theories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper
describes the Popperian method and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the
method to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior.
It is shown how Lighthill's falsifying arguments especially combinatorial
explosion continue to apply to modern AI. Various skeptical arguments against
the assumptions of AI mostly by physicists especially against Hilbert's
philosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal
sentences. John von Neumann's arguments from natural complexity against neural
networks and evolutionary algorithms are discussed. Next the game of chess is
discussed to show how modern chess experts have reacted to computer chess
programs. It is shown that currently chess masters can defeat any chess program
using Kasperov's arguments from his 1997 Deep Blue match and aftermath. The
game of 'go' and climate models are discussed to show computer applications
where combinatorial explosion may not apply. The paper concludes by advocating
studying computation as Peter Naur's Dataology.
