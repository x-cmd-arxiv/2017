theoretically analyzed in a trapped-ion setup. Recognizably, the main hallmark

observation is hindered under realistic magnetic dephasing noise. Here we
discuss how to attain a faithful implementation of the quantum Rabi model in
the deep strong coupling regime which is robust against magnetic field
fluctuations and at the same time provides a large tunability of the simulated

with continuous dynamical decoupling. In addition, we study the role that
amplitude fluctuations play to correctly attain the quantum Rabi model using
the proposed method. In this manner the present work further supports the
suitability of continuous dynamical decoupling techniques in trapped-ion

couplings and Zeeman fields on equal footing with the electromagnetic
potentials, is an appealing framework to develop a unified first-principles
computational approach for non-collinear magnetism, spintronics, orbitronics,
and topological states. The basic variables of this theory include the
paramagnetic current and the spin-current density, besides the particle and the
spin density, and the corresponding exchange-correlation (xc) energy functional
is invariant under local U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge transformations. The xc-energy
functional must be approximated to enable practical applications, but, contrary
to the case of the standard density functional theory, finding simple
approximations suited to deal with realistic atomistic inhomogeneities has been
a long-standing challenge. Here, we propose a way out of this impasse by
showing that approximate gauge-invariant functionals can be easily generated
from existing approximate functionals of ordinary density-functional theory by
applying a simple {\it minimal substitution} on the kinetic energy density,
which controls the short-range behavior of the exchange hole. Our proposal
opens the way to the construction of approximate, yet non-empirical
functionals, which do not assume weak inhomogeneity and should therefore have a
wide range of applicability in atomic, molecular and condensed matter physics.

age-date the chemical evolution of the high- and low-$\alpha$ element sequences
of the Milky Way. Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose
stellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high-$\alpha$,
high-[Fe/H] region of the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's
age ($\sim 8$ Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane,
as well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we
suggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part
of the thick-disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover,
because NGC 6791 lies at the \textit{high metallicity end} ([Fe/H] $\sim 0.4$)
of the high-$\alpha$ sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the
\textit{youngest age} of stars in the high-metallicity, high-$\alpha$ sequence
for the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a
similar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of
$\sim 7$ Gyr on the \textit{oldest age} of the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the
Milky Way. Therefore, NGC 6791 and NGC 188 are potentially a pair of star
clusters that bracket both the timing and the duration of an important
transition point in the chemical history of the Milky Way.

these objects form remains non completely understood. In this work we review an
alternative mechanism of formation of galactic SMBHs. This is, the collapse of
ultra-light scalar field configurations playing the role of dark matter halos.
Several works have studied this scenario and investigated its plausibility. The
theory of collapse of scalar field configurations into compact objects has been
extensively studied regarding to boson stars, in this work we extrapolate such
results for models of galactic halos hosting central SMBHs. We construct the
simplest setup of an ultra-light scalar field configuration laying in a
Schwarzschild space-time for modeling a galactic system with a SMBH in the
quasi-static limit. This model is applicable to systems either out of their
accretion-phase at late times or either for those undergoing into a very slow
accretion-phase, such as some early-type giant elliptic galaxies and bulges.
  On the other hand, very recent direct observation of Sagittarius A by the
Event Horizon Telescope will open an era of explorations of the deep-inner
galactic region of the Milky Way that will enable us to test and distinguish
various dark matter models. Thus we use our model to give a very first step
towards that direction. We derive the stellar kinematics induced by this sort
dark matter to obtain information of the black hole's influence into the
observable features of the velocity field of visible matter deep inside the
galaxy. Thus we compute the radial velocity, acceleration and velocity
dispersion densities for some realistic cases.

three-dimensional effects to fully describe turbulent transport processes and
non-linear phenomena. Motions can thus be classified into two classes: fast
modes consisting of inertia-gravity waves, and slow quasi-geostrophic modes for
which the Coriolis force and horizontal pressure gradients are close to
balance. In this paper we review previous results on the strength of the
inverse cascade in rotating and stratified flows, and then present new results
on the effect of varying the strength of rotation and stratification (measured
by the ratio $N/f$ of the Brunt-V\""ais\""ala frequency to the Coriolis

$N/f$ for which resonant triads do not exist, $1/2 \le N/f \le 2$. We then use
the spatio-temporal spectrum, and characterization of the flow temporal and

with the optimal rate of strong convergence for Euler approximations of
stochastic differential equations with globally Lipschitz coefficients, despite

including DNA-based self-assembly, card-shuffling and lozenge tilings. One
method that has been used to uniformly generate these surfaces is a Markov
chain that iteratively adds or removes a single cube below the surface during a
step. We consider a biased version of the chain, where we are more likely to
add a cube than to remove it, thereby favoring surfaces that are ""higher"" or
have more cubes below it. We prove that the chain is rapidly mixing for any
uniform bias in $Z^2$ and for bias $\lambda > d$ in $Z^d$ when $d>2$. In $Z^2$
we match the optimal mixing time achieved by Benjamini et al. in the context of
biased card shuffling, but using much simpler arguments. The proofs use a
geometric distance function and a variant of path coupling in order to handle
distances that can be exponentially large. We also provide the first results in
the case of fluctuating bias, where the bias can vary depending on the location
of the tile. We show that the chain continues to be rapidly mixing if the
biases are close to uniform, but that the chain can converge exponentially
slowly in the general setting.

up to the bias voltage of 0.4 V is dominated by a conductive lowest unoccupied

because the conductive channel moves to the highest occupied molecular orbital

the one-pion exchange potential, both treated fully nonperturbatively. The
strength of the potential at leading order is fixed completely by the pole

trajectories of their spin partner states as functions of the $Z_b$ binding
energies. It is shown that, once the heavy-quark spin symmetry is broken by
means of the physical $B$ and $B^*$ masses, especially the pion tensor force
has a significant impact on the location of the partner states clearly
demonstrating the need of a coupled-channel treatment of pion dynamics to
understand the spin multiplet pattern of hadronic molecules.

varying convex optimization problems is key in many applications. A possible
strategy is to sample the time-varying problem at constant rate and solve the
resulting time-invariant problem. This can be too computationally burdensome in
many scenarios. An alternative strategy is to set up an iterative algorithm
that generates a sequence of approximate optimizers, which are refined every
time a new sampled time-invariant problem is available by one iteration of the
algorithm. These types of algorithms are called running. A major limitation of
current running algorithms is their key assumption of strong convexity and
strong smoothness of the time-varying convex function. In addition, constraints
are only handled in simple cases. This limits the current capability for
running algorithms to tackle relevant problems, such as $\ell_1$-regularized
optimization programs. In this paper, these assumptions are lifted by
leveraging averaged operator theory and a fairly comprehensive framework for
time-varying convex optimization is presented. In doing so, new results

loop in the context of universal extra dimensions. Instead of using cutoffs to
regularize 1-loop divergences, the dimensional regularization scheme is used.
Large momenta effects are removed from physical amplitudes by adjusting the
parameters of the appropriate counterterms. The use of a SU(N)-covariant
gauge-fixing procedure is stressed. 1-loop contributions of KK excitations are
characterized by discrete KK sums and continuous momenta sums, which can
diverge. Two types of UVs are identified, one arising from poles of the gamma
function and associated with short-distance effects in the usual 4-dimensional
spacetime manifold, and the other emerging either from poles of the
1-dimensional Epstein function or from the gamma function, and corresponding to
short-distance effects in the compact manifold. We address the cases of 5 and
4+n dimensions (n>1) separately. In 5 dimensions the 1-dimensional Epstein
function is convergent, so the usual counterterm renormalizes the vacuum
polarization function. For 4+n dimensions, the 1-dimensional Epstein function
is divergent, so renormalization is implemented by interactions of canonical
dimension higher than 4, already present in the effective theory. The
polarization function is renormalized using both mass-dependent and
mass-independent schemes, with extra-dimensions effects decoupling in the
former case but not in the latter. The beta function is calculated for an
arbitrary number of extra dimensions. Our main result is that Yang-Mills theory
remains perturbative at 1 loop, which is in disagreement with the results
obtained in the literature by using a cutoff regulator, which suggest that
Yang-Mills theory in more than 4 dimensions ceases to be perturbative. We
emphasize the advantages of a mass-dependent scheme in this type of theories,
in which decoupling is manifest.

initial chore of cleaning up an image (removing extraneous material such as

typically presents a separate and demanding challenge for each different image.
Moreover care must be taken, even in the relatively straightforward cases of
clearly defined ground-plans (for example for large ecclesiastical buildings of
the period), to consider exactly what measurements might be relevant. We report
on pilot statistical analyses concerning three different situations. These
establish not only the presence of underlying structure (which indeed is often
visually obvious), but also provide an account of the numerical evidence
supporting the deduction that such structure is present. We contend that

loops in the penumbra of a large sunspot on July 19, 2013. Our main event
consisted of a loop spanning ~ 15 arcsec, from the umbral-penumbral boundary to
an opposite polarity region outside the penumbra. It lasted approximately 10
minutes with a two minute impulsive peak and was observed in all AIA/SDO
channels, while the IRIS slit was located near its penumbral footpoint. Mass
motions with an apparent velocity of ~ 100 km/s were detected beyond the
brightening, starting in the rise phase of the impulsive peak; these were
apparently associated with a higher-lying loop. We interpret these motions in
terms of two-loop interaction. IRIS spectra in both the C II and Si IV lines
showed very extended wings, up to about 400 km/s, first in the blue (upflows)
and subsequently in the red wing. In addition to the strong lines, emission was
detected in the weak lines of Cl I, O I and C I as well as in the Mg II triplet
lines. Absorption features in the profiles of the C II doublet, the Si IV
doublet and the Mg h and k lines indicate the existence of material with a
lower source function between the brightening and the observer. We attribute
this absorption to the higher loop and this adds further credibility to the
two-loop interaction hypothesis. We conclude that the absorption features in
the C II, Si IV and Mg II profiles originate in a higher-lying, descending
loop; as this approached the already activated lower-lying loop, their
interaction gave rise to the impulsive peak, the very broad line profiles and
the mass motions.

remains their analysis in terms of spherical harmonics. When only regional data
are available, or when data quality varies strongly with geographic location,
the inversion problem becomes severely ill-posed. In those cases, adopting
explicitly local methods is to be preferred over adapting global ones (e.g., by
regularization). Here, we develop the theory behind a procedure to invert for
planetary potential fields from vector observations collected within a
spatially bounded region at varying satellite altitude. Our method relies on
the construction of spatiospectrally localized bases of functions that mitigate
the noise amplification caused by downward continuation (from the satellite
altitude to the planetary surface) while balancing the conflicting demands for
spatial concentration and spectral limitation. Solving simultaneously for
internal and external fields in the same setting of regional data availability
reduces internal-field artifacts introduced by downward-continuing unmodeled
external fields, as we show with numerical examples. The AC-GVSF are optimal
linear combinations of vector spherical harmonics. Their construction is not
altogether very computationally demanding when the concentration domains (the
regions of spatial concentration) have circular symmetry, e.g., on spherical
caps or rings - even when the spherical-harmonic bandwidth is large. Data
inversion proceeds by solving for the expansion coefficients of truncated
function sequences, by least-squares analysis in a reduced-dimensional space.
Hence, our method brings high-resolution regional potential-field modeling from
incomplete and noisy vector-valued satellite data within reach of contemporary

environmental factors play crucial roles in triggering complex diseases. Thus,
understanding such interactions is vital, which is possible only through
statistical models that adequately account for such intricate, albeit unknown,
dependence structures. Bhattacharya & Bhattacharya (2016b) attempt such
modeling, relating finite mixtures composed of Dirichlet processes that
represent unknown number of genetic sub-populations through a hierarchical
matrix-normal structure that incorporates gene-gene interactions, and possible
mutations, induced by environmental variables. However, the product dependence
structure implied by their matrix-normal model seems to be too simple to be
appropriate for general complex, realistic situations. In this article, we
propose and develop a novel nonparametric Bayesian model for case-control
genotype data using hierarchies of Dirichlet processes that offers a more
realistic and nonparametric dependence structure between the genes, induced by
the environmental variables. In this regard, we propose a novel and highly

combination of modern parallel computing technology, effective Gibbs sampling
steps, retrospective sampling and Transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(TMCMC). We use appropriate Bayesian hypothesis testing procedures to detect
the roles of genes and environment in case-control studies. We apply our ideas
to 5 biologically realistic case-control genotype datasets simulated under
distinct set-ups, and obtain encouraging results in each case. We finally apply
our ideas to a real, myocardial infarction dataset, and obtain interesting
results on gene-gene and gene-environment interaction, while broadly agreeing

these methods remain largely unexplored. In the absence of statistical

has been studied over several decades, although mostly using single time
series. This paper studies the problem of estimating these components from
functional data, i.e. multiple time series, in situations where seasonal
effects exhibit arbitrary time warpings or phase variability across different
observations. Rather than ignoring the phase variability, or using an
off-the-shelf alignment method to remove phase, we take a model-based approach
and seek MLEs of the trend and the seasonal effects, while performing
alignments over the seasonal effects at the same time. The MLEs of trend,
seasonality, and phase are computed using a coordinate-descent based
optimization method. We use bootstrap replication for computing confidence
bands and for testing hypothesis about the estimated components. We also
utilize log-likelihood for selecting the trend subspace, and for comparisons
with other candidate models. This framework is demonstrated using experiments
involving synthetic data and three real data (Berkeley Growth Velocity, U.S.
electricity price, and USD exchange fluctuation).

curvature experienced in many random interface models reflects an important
aspect of the KPZ universality class. It may be summarised by an exponent
triple $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$ representing local interface fluctuation, local
roughness (or inward deviation) and convex hull facet length. The three effects
arise, for example, in droplets in planar Ising models (Alexander, '01,
Hammond, '11,'12). In this article, we offer a new perspective on this
phenomenon. We consider directed last passage percolation model in the plane, a
paradigmatic example in the KPZ universality class, and constrain the
maximizing path under the additional requirement of enclosing an atypically
large area. The interface suffers a constraint of parabolic curvature as
before, but now its local structure is the KPZ fixed point polymer's rather
than Brownian. The local interface fluctuation exponent is thus two-thirds
rather than one-half. We prove that the facet lengths of the constrained path's
convex hull are governed by an exponent of $3/4$, and inward deviation by an
exponent of $1/2$. That is, the exponent triple is now $(2/3,1/2,3/4)$ in place
of $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$. This phenomenon appears to be shared among various
isoperimetrically extremal circuits in local randomness. Indeed, we formulate a
conjecture to this effect concerning such circuits in supercritical
percolation, whose Wulff-like first-order behaviour was recently established
(Biskup, Louidor, Procaccia and Rosenthal, '12).

300 ppm at ingress/egress. While these errors are small they are systematic,

state called a graph state is used to perform universal quantum computations by
a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements and post-measurement Pauli-X
and Pauli-Z corrections. The needed computations are organized as measurement
patterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in
a pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and
output qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum
computation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally
nondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to
guarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)
is a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a
dependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve
determinism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to
simplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and
Pauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement
calculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these
rules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.
Moreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing
many ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a
new scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow
or gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for
geometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed
approach is improved over the previous ones.

disentangling the nature of this AGN by using simultaneous multiwavelength
data. We obtained data in 2015 from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the
San Pedro M\'{a}rtir telescope, and the XMM-Newton}observatories. This allows
the study of the nuclear parts of the galaxy through its morphology and
spectra, as well as the analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We
also reanalysed optical data from the San Pedro M\'{a}rtir telescope from 2009
previously presented in Parisi et al. (2012) for a homogeneous comparison. At
X-ray frequencies, the source is unabsorbed. The optical spectra are of a type
1.9 AGN, both in 2009 and 2015, although showing a broader component in 2015.
The VLBA radio images show an inverted spectrum with self-absorbed, optically
thick compact core and steep spectrum, optically thin jet. The SED resembles
that of typical blazars and is best represented by an external Compton (EC)
model with a viewing angle of $\sim$ 3-6 degrees. The apparent size of the
large scale structure of PBC J2333.9-2343 must correspond to an intrinsic
deprojected value of $\sim 7$ Mpc for $\theta_v<10^\circ$, and to $> 13$ Mpc
for $\theta_v<5^\circ$, a value much larger than the bigger giant radio galaxy
known (4.5 Mpc). The above arguments suggest that PBC J2333.9-2343 has
undergone through a new episode of nuclear activity and that the direction of
the new jet has changed, in the plane of the sky and is now pointing towards
us, making this source from being a radio galaxy to become a blazar, a very
exceptional case of restarting activity.

with $SO(7)$ broken to the exceptional group $G_2$. In addition to the Higgs,
three pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons arise, one of which is electrically
neutral. A parity symmetry is enough to ensure this resonance is stable. In
fact, if the breaking of the Goldstone symmetry is driven by the fermion
sector, this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is automatically unbroken in the
electroweak phase. In this case, the relic density, as well as the expected
indirect, direct and collider signals are then uniquely determined by the value
of the compositeness scale, $f$. Current experimental bounds allow to account
for a large fraction of the dark matter of the Universe if the dark matter
particle is part of an electroweak triplet. The totality of the relic abundance
can be accommodated if instead this particle is a composite singlet. In both
cases, the scale $f$ and the dark matter mass are of the order of a few TeV.

a very low level of systematics, the techniques proposed here will be able to
confirm the production of a pair of Standard Model Higgs bosons at 5$\sigma$

level of systematics, around 10\%, the optimization of cuts to train BDTs
combined with a multivariate analysis delivers a respectable significance of
4.6$\sigma$. Even assuming large systematics of 20\%, our analysis predicts a
3.6$\sigma$ significance, which represents at least strong evidence in favor of
double Higgs production. We carefully incorporate background contributions

with GW effects cut-off above the turbopause and included in the entire
thermosphere have been conducted. GWs appreciably impact the mean circulation
and cool the thermosphere down by up to 12-18%. GWs significantly affect the
winds modulated by the diurnal migrating tide, in particular in the
low-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the high-latitude
thermosphere. These effects depend on the mutual correlation of the diurnal
phases of the GW forcing and tides: GWs can either enhance or reduce the tidal
amplitude. In the low-latitude MLT, the correlation between the direction of
the deposited GW momentum and the tidal phase is positive due to propagation of
a broad spectrum of GW harmonics through the alternating winds. In the Northern
Hemisphere high-latitude thermosphere, GWs act against the tide due to an
anti-correlation of tidal wind and GW momentum, while in the Southern
high-latitudes they weakly enhance the tidal amplitude via a combination of a
partial correlation of phases and GW-induced changes of the circulation. The
variable nature of GW effects on the thermal tide can be captured in GCMs
provided that a GW parameterization (1) considers a broad spectrum of
harmonics, (2) properly describes their propagation, and (3) correctly accounts

saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one
umbrella. The motivation behind such a problem formulation is (1) the benefits
to the knowledge representation-based vision pipelines, and (2) the potential
improvements in emulating bio-inspired vision systems by solving these three
problems together. We are foreseeing extending this problem formulation to
fully semantically segmented scenes with instance object priority for
high-level inferences in various applications including assistive vision. Along
with a new problem definition, we also propose a method to achieve such a task.
The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the

widely used in linear algebra packages, as balancing preserves eigenvalues and
stabilizes their numeral computation. The iteration can be implemented in any
norm over $\mathbb{R}^n$, but it is normally used in the $L_2$ norm. The choice
of norm not only affects the desired balance condition, but also defines the
iterated balancing step itself.
  In this paper we focus on Osborne's iteration in any $L_p$ norm, where $p <
\infty$. We design a specific implementation of Osborne's iteration in any
$L_p$ norm that converges to a strictly $\epsilon$-balanced matrix in
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2}n^{9} K)$ iterations, where $K$ measures, roughly, the
{\em number of bits} required to represent the entries of the input matrix.
  This is the first result that proves that Osborne's iteration in the $L_2$
norm (or any $L_p$ norm, $p < \infty$) strictly balances matrices in polynomial
time. This is a substantial improvement over our recent result (in SODA 2017)
that showed weak balancing in $L_p$ norms. Previously, Schulman and Sinclair
(STOC 2015) showed strong balancing of Osborne's iteration in the $L_\infty$
norm. Their result does not imply any bounds on strict balancing in other
norms.

mechanics treatment of solute with a fluid mechanics treatment of solvent,
where we formulated the physical model and developed a numerical fluid dynamics
integrator. In this study, we incorporated the fluid dynamics integrator with
the Amber simulation engine to conduct atomistic simulations of biomolecules.
At this stage of the development, only nonelectrostatic interactions, i.e., van
del Waals and hydrophobic interactions are included in the multi-scale model.
Nevertheless numerical challenges exist in accurately interpolating the highly
nonlinear van del Waals term when solving the finite-difference fluid dynamics
equations. We were able to bypass the challenge rigorously by merging the van
del Waals potential and pressure together when solving the fluid dynamics
equations and by considering its contribution in the free-boundary condition
analytically. The multi-scale simulation engine was first validated by
reproducing the solute-solvent interface of a single atom with analytical
solution. Next, we performed the relaxation simulation of a restrained
symmetrical monomer and observed a symmetrical solvent interface at equilibrium
with detailed surface features resembling those found on the solvent excluded
surface. Four typical small molecular complexes were then tested, both volume
and force balancing analysis showing that these simple complexes can reach
equilibrium within the simulation time window. Finally, we studied the quality
of the multi-scale solute-solvent interfaces for the four tested dimer
complexes and found they agree well with the boundaries as sampled in the
explicit water simulations.

Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. The flare monitor has been fully
operational since 2017 January and is designed to detect very high energy (VHE;
$E\gtrsim100$ GeV) transient events from blazars on time scales lasting from 2
minutes to 10 hours in order to facilitate multiwavelength and multimessenger
studies. These flares provide information for investigations into the
mechanisms that power the blazars' relativistic jets and accelerate particles
within them, and they may also serve as probes of the populations of particles
and fields in intergalactic space. To date, the detection of blazar flares in
the VHE range has relied primarily on pointed observations by imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The recently completed HAWC observatory
offers the opportunity to study VHE flares in survey mode, scanning 2/3 of the
entire sky every day with a field of view of $\sim$1.8 steradians. In this
work, we report on the sensitivity of the HAWC real-time flare monitor and
demonstrate its capabilities via the detection of three high-confidence VHE
events in the blazars Markarian 421 and Markarian 501.

case of degenerate semiconductors. Based on the Debye-Waller attenuation of the
elastic diffraction peaks of Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111), measured at surface
temperatures between $110~\mbox{K}$ and $355~\mbox{K}$, we find $\lambda$ to be
in the range of $0.04-0.11$. This method allows to extract a correctly averaged

relatively modest value of $\lambda$ is not surprising even though some
individual phonons may provide a larger electron-phonon interaction.
  Furthermore, the surface Debye temperature of Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) is determined
as ${\rm \Theta}_D = (81\pm6)~\mbox{K}$. The electronic surface corrugation was

also the transition rates between system states become time-dependent which

Three implications are demonstrated: (a) oscillations and steady states shift
in phase space with decreasing system size, thereby also decreasing
considerably the oscillating parameter regions; (b) the minimal number of
molecules necessary to support correlated oscillations is more than 10 times as

we find an H2O absorption feature with 3.5-4.0 sigma significance. However, the

Although the detection of the water feature is robust, the reasons for the
muting of this feature are ambiguous due to a degeneracy between clouds and

~5500 local (z<0.1) star-forming galaxies and obtain an estimate of their
average total-to-selective attenuation $k(\lambda)$. We utilize data from the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) and the Two Micron All-Sky Survey
(2MASS), which is combined with previously measured UV-optical data for these
galaxies. The average attenuation curve is slightly lower in the far-UV than
local starburst galaxies, by roughly 15%, but appears similar at longer
wavelengths with a total-to-selective normalization at V-band of
$R_V=3.67\substack{+0.44 \\ -0.35}$. Under the assumption of energy balance,
the total attenuated energy inferred from this curve is found to be broadly
consistent with the observed infrared dust emission ($L_{\rm{TIR}}$) in a small
sample of local galaxies for which far-IR measurements are available. However,
the significant scatter in this quantity among the sample may reflect large
variations in the attenuation properties of individual galaxies. We also derive
the attenuation curve for sub-populations of the main sample, separated
according to mean stellar population age (via $D_n4000$), specific star
formation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity, and find that they show only
tentative trends with low significance, at least over the range which is probed
by our sample. These results indicate that a single curve is reasonable for
applications seeking to broadly characterize large samples of galaxies in the
local Universe, while applications to individual galaxies would yield large
uncertainties and is not recommended.

odd-even staggering in energies and radii, and nuclear matter properties.
Detailed analysis is carried out for medium-mass and heavy semi-magic nuclei

terms dependent on density gradients, the Fayans functional offers the superb
simultaneous description of odd-even staggering effects in energies and charge

combines direct and indirect methods so as to correctly investigate the giant

Carlo simulation code combining radial velocity and direct imaging data
obtained at different epochs for a given star to estimate the detection
probability of giant planets spanning a wide range of physical separations. It
is based on the generation of synthetic planet populations. We apply MESS2 on a
young M1-type, the nearby star AUMic observed with HARPS and NACO/ESO. We show
that giant planet detection limits are significantly improved at intermediate
separations (~20au in the case of AUMic). We show that the traditional approach
of analysing independently the RV and DI detection limits systematically
overestimates the planet detection limits and hence planet occurrence rates.
The use of MESS2 allows to obtain correct planet occurrence rates in

spectra identify high-velocity outflows that might be present in all quasars
and could be a major factor in feedback to galaxy evolution. Understanding the
nature of these flows requires further constraints on their physical
properties, including their column densities, for which well-studied BALs, such
as CIV 1548,1551, typically provide only a lower limit because of saturation
effects. Low-abundance lines, such as PV 1118,1128, indicate large column
densities, implying outflows more powerful than measurements of CIV alone would
indicate. We search through a sample of 2694 BAL quasars from the SDSS-III/BOSS
DR9 quasar catalog for such absorption, and we identify 81 `definite' and 86
`probable' detections of PV broad absorption, yielding a firm lower limit of
3.0-6.2% for the incidence of such absorption among BAL quasars. The
PV-detected quasars tend to have stronger CIV and SiIV absorption, as well as a
higher incidence of LoBAL absorption, than the overall BAL quasar population.
Many of the PV-detected quasars have CIV troughs that do not reach zero
intensity (at velocities where PV is detected), confirming that the outflow gas
only partially covers the UV continuum source. PV appears significantly in a
composite spectrum of non-PV-detected BAL quasars, indicating that PV
absorption (and large column densities) are much more common than indicated by
our search results. Our sample of PV detections significantly increases the
number of known PV detections, providing opportunities for follow-up studies to
better understand BAL outflow energetics.

been published over a limited range of phase angles and spectral passbands [5,
6]. Such information has been key to the study of the stratification,
microphysics and aggregate nature of Titan's atmospheric haze [7, 8], and has
complemented the spatially-resolved observations first showing that the haze
scatters efficiently in the forward direction [7, 9]. Here we present Cassini
Imaging Science Subsystem whole-disk brightness measurements of Titan from
ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The observations reveal that Titan's
twilight (loosely defined as the view when the phase angle 150deg) outshines
its daylight at various wavelengths. From the match between measurements and
models, we show that at even larger phase angles the back-illuminated moon will
appear much brighter than when fully illuminated. This behavior is unique to
Titan in our solar system, and is caused by its extended atmosphere and the
efficient forward scattering of sunlight by its atmospheric haze. We infer a
solar energy deposition rate (for a solar constant of 14.9 Wm-2) of
(2.84+/-0.11)x10^14 W, consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations with
Titan's time-varying thermal emission spanning 2007- 2013 [10, 11]. We propose
that a forward scattering signature may also occur at large phase angles in the
brightness of exoplanets with extended hazy atmospheres, and that this
signature has valuable diagnostic potential for atmospheric characterization.

on water in a neutrino beam with a peak neutrino energy of 0.6 GeV has been
measured using the P{\O}D, one of the subdetectors of the T2K near detector.
The production rate was measured for data taking periods when the P{\O}D
contained water ($2.64\times{}10^{20}$ protons-on-target) and also periods
without water ($3.49 \times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target). A measurement of the
neutral current single $\pi^0$ production rate on water is made using
appropriate subtraction of the production rate with water in from the rate with
water out of the target region. The subtraction analysis yields 106 $\pm$ 41
(stat.) $\pm$ 69 (sys.) signal events, which is consistent with the prediction
of 157 events from the nominal simulation. The measured to expected ratio is
0.68 $\pm$ 0.26 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.44 (sys.) $\pm$ 0.12 (flux). The nominal
simulation uses a flux integrated cross section of $7.63\times{}10^{-39}$

features (gk), have obtained great success in classifying sequences like DNA,
protein, and text. However, the state-of-the-art gk-SK runs extremely slow when
we increase the dictionary size ($\Sigma$) or allow more mismatches ($M$). This
is because current gk-SK uses a trie-based algorithm to calculate co-occurrence
of mismatched substrings resulting in a time cost proportional to
$O(\Sigma^{M})$. We propose a \textbf{fast} algorithm for calculating
\underline{Ga}pped $k$-mer \underline{K}ernel using \underline{Co}unting
(GaKCo). GaKCo uses associative arrays to calculate the co-occurrence of
substrings using cumulative counting. This algorithm is fast, scalable to
larger $\Sigma$ and $M$, and naturally parallelizable. We provide a rigorous
asymptotic analysis that compares GaKCo with the state-of-the-art gk-SK.
Theoretically, the time cost of GaKCo is independent of the $\Sigma^{M}$ term
that slows down the trie-based approach. Experimentally, we observe that GaKCo
achieves the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art and outperforms its speed by
factors of 2, 100, and 4, on classifying sequences of DNA (5 datasets), protein
(12 datasets), and character-based English text (2 datasets), respectively.

are capable of measuring distances to the target. Decentralized control
strategies have been proposed in the past that guarantee that the robots
asymptotically converge to the optimal formation. However, existing methods
require that the robots exchange information with their neighbors at all time
steps. Instead, we focus on decentralized strategies to reduce the amount of
communication among robots.
  We propose a self-triggered communication strategy that decides when a
particular robot should seek up-to-date information from its neighbors and when
it is safe to operate with possibly outdated information. We prove that this
strategy converges asymptotically to a desired formation when the target is
stationary. For the case of a mobile target, we propose an extension whereby
each robot decides its optimal partner to share its measurements with using
observability as a criterion. We evaluate all the approaches (constant

collective states that can radiate faster or slower than a single atom, i.e.
super- and sub-radiance. The generation and control of such states by
engineering the dipolar interactions between atoms can enable new tools for
atomic-based technologies. Atom-atom interactions in free space are limited in
range, since the amplitude of the radiated field decreases inversely with
distance. When the field is confined to one dimension it enables infinite-range
interactions. This has been observed for atoms in an optical cavity, but
remains to be proven in one-dimensional waveguides, where the extent of the
interactions is not limited by the cavity size. Here we present the first
report of infinite-range interactions between macroscopically separated atomic
dipoles mediated by an optical waveguide. This is evidenced by the collective
radiative decay of a single photon distributed between distant atoms. We use
cold $^{87}$Rb atoms in the vicinity of a single-mode optical nanofiber (ONF)
that coherently exchange evanescently coupled photons through the ONF mode. In
particular, we observe super-radiance of a few atoms separated by hundreds of
resonant wavelengths. This effect is not possible for atoms separated by more
than a wavelength interacting through free space. The same platform allows us
to measure sub-radiance, a rarely observed effect, presenting a novel tool for
quantum optics. This result constitutes a proof-of-principle for collective
behavior of macroscopically delocalized atomic states, a crucial element for
new proposals in quantum information and many-body physics. Given the
application of one-dimensional waveguides in photonic-based quantum

on the case when all the species experience intracompetition. The food chain we
analyze consists of one prey and $n-1$ predators. The $j$th predator eats the
$j-1$st species and is eaten by the $j+1$st predator; this way each species
only interacts with at most two other species - the ones that are immediately

interaction coefficients of the system via an algorithm), which species go
extinct and which converge to their unique invariant probability measure. We
obtain stronger results than in the case with no intraspecific competition

been attracting enormous attention from computer vision community recent years
and several novel works have been done in terms of its application in retinal
blood vessel segmentation, most of them are based on supervised learning which
requires amount of labeled data, which is both scarce and expensive to obtain.
We leverage the power of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) in feature
learning, in this work, to achieve this ultimate goal. The highly efficient
feature learning of DCNN inspires our novel approach that trains the networks
with automatically-generated samples to achieve desirable performance on
real-world fundus images. For this, we design a set of rules abstracted from
the domain-specific prior knowledge to generate these samples. We argue that,
with the high efficiency of DCNN in feature learning, one can achieve this goal
by constructing the training dataset with prior knowledge, no manual labeling
is needed. This approach allows us to take advantages of supervised learning
without labeling. We also build a naive DCNN model to test it. The results on
standard benchmarks of fundus imaging show it is competitive to the

research, we explore the possibility of using deep learning to improve symbolic
reasoning. Briefly, in a reasoning system, a deep feedforward neural network is
used to guide rewriting processes after learning from algebraic reasoning
examples produced by humans. To enable the neural network to recognise patterns
of algebraic expressions with non-deterministic sizes, reduced partial trees
are used to represent the expressions. Also, to represent both top-down and
bottom-up information of the expressions, a centralisation technique is used to
improve the reduced partial trees. Besides, symbolic association vectors and
rule application records are used to improve the rewriting processes.
Experimental results reveal that the algebraic reasoning examples can be
accurately learnt only if the feedforward neural network has enough hidden
layers. Also, the centralisation technique, the symbolic association vectors
and the rule application records can reduce error rates of reasoning. In
particular, the above approaches have led to 4.6% error rate of reasoning on a
dataset of linear equations, differentials and integrals.

of probability theory, is required to provide a complete logic on which to base
quantitative theories of empirical learning. The organizing question in this

rates under a hierarchical prior design: the first-step prior serves to assess
the model selection uncertainty, and the second-step prior quantifies the prior
belief on the strength of the signals within the model chosen from the first
step. In particular, we establish non-asymptotic oracle posterior contraction
rates under (i) a local Gaussianity condition on the log likelihood ratio of
the statistical experiment, (ii) a local entropy condition on the
dimensionality of the models, and (iii) a sufficient mass condition on the
second-step prior near the best approximating signal for each model. The
first-step prior can be designed generically. The posterior distribution enjoys
Gaussian tail behavior and therefore the resulting posterior mean also
satisfies an oracle inequality, automatically serving as an adaptive point
estimator in a frequentist sense. Model mis-specification is allowed in these
oracle rates.
  The local Gaussianity condition serves as a unified attempt of non-asymptotic
Gaussian quantification of the experiments, and can be easily verified in
various experiments considered in [GvdV07a] and beyond. The general results are
applied in various problems including: (i) trace regression, (ii)
shape-restricted isotonic/convex regression, (iii) high-dimensional partially

estimation in a Poisson point process model. These new results serve either as
theoretical justification of practical prior proposals in the literature, or as

the disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of
large ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary

multi-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL
instability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer

precession resonances delineate instability branches. We determine the range of

ask whether individuals may take into account the information on the population

census data in Japan recorded with a high spatial resolution (i.e., cells of
size 500 m $\times$ 500 m) for the entirety of the country and simulate
demographic dynamics induced by the gravity model and its variants. We show
that, in the census data, the population growth rate in a cell is positively
correlated with the population density in nearby cells up to a radius of 20 km
as well as that of the focal cell. The ordinary gravity model does not capture
this empirical observation. We then show that the empirical observation is
better accounted for by extensions of the gravity model such that individuals

  memory retrieval in a spiking network model of the hippocampus",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hippocampal CA3 is crucial for the formation of long-term associative memory.
It has a heavily recurrent connectivity, and memories are thought to be stored
as memory engrams in the CA3. However, despite its importance for memory
storage and retrieval, spiking network models of the CA3 to date are relatively
small-scale, and exist as only proof-of-concept models. Specifically, how
neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus affects memory encoding and retrieval in the
CA3 is not studied in such spiking models. Our work is the first to develop a
biologically plausible spiking neural network model of hippocampal memory
encoding and retrieval, with at least an order-of-magnitude more neurons than
previous models. It is also the first to investigate the effect of neurogenesis
on CA3 memory encoding and retrieval. Using such a model, we first show that a
recently developed plasticity model is crucial for good encoding and retrieval.
Next, we show how neural properties related to neurogenesis and neuronal death
enhance storage and retrieval of associative memories in the CA3. In
particular, we show that without neurogenesis, increasing number of CA3 neurons
are recruited by each new memory stimulus, resulting in a corresponding
increase in inhibition and poor memory retrieval as more memories are encoded.
Neurogenesis, on the other hand, maintains the number of CA3 neurons recruited
per stimulus, and enables the retrieval of recent memories, while forgetting
the older ones. Our model suggests that structural plasticity (provided by
neurogenesis and apoptosis) is required in the hippocampus for memory encoding
and retrieval when the network is overloaded; synaptic plasticity alone does
not suffice. The above results are obtained from an exhaustive study in the
different plasticity models and network parameters.

the projection step preserving important image contents and reducing image
distortion. Basically, our projection method is based on Pannini projection
model. At first, the salient contents such as linear structures and salient
regions in the image are preserved by optimizing the single Panini projection
model. Then, the multiple Panini projection models at salient regions are
interpolated to suppress image distortion globally. Finally, the temporal
consistency for image projection is enforced for producing temporally stable
normal-view videos. Our proposed projection method does not require any
user-interaction and is much faster than previous content-preserving methods.
It can be applied to not only images but also videos taking the temporal
consistency of projection into account. Experiments on various 360{\deg} videos
show the superiority of the proposed projection method quantitatively and
qualitatively.

outcome relies on proper adjustment for confounding. If the number of the
potential confounders ($p$) is larger than the number of observations ($n$),
then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing
approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at
predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects.
Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable $X_j$ is
strongly associated with the treatment $T$ but weakly with the outcome $Y$, the
coefficient $\beta_j$ will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding
bias.
  Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we
propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients
$\beta_j$ corresponding to the potential confounders $X_j$. Specifically, we
introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the
coefficients ($\beta_j$s) of the $X_j$s that are strongly associated with $T$
but weakly associated with $Y$. We compare our proposed approach to several
state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has
the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional
settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables;
and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our
approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data

interacting Fermion models in 1D. When coupled with Density Functional Theory

of lower quotas (LQ). The input instance consists of a bipartite graph $G =
(\mathcal{R} \cup \mathcal{H}, E)$ where $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ denote
sets of residents and hospitals respectively. Every vertex has a preference
list that imposes a strict ordering on its neighbors. In addition, each
hospital $h$ has an associated upper-quota $q^+(h)$ and lower-quota $q^-(h)$. A
matching $M$ in $G$ is an assignment of residents to hospitals, and $M$ is said
to be feasible if every resident is assigned to at most one hospital and a
hospital $h$ is assigned at least $q^-(h)$ and at most $q^+(h)$ residents.
  Stability is a de-facto notion of optimality in a model where both sets of
vertices have preferences. A matching is stable if no unassigned pair has an
incentive to deviate from it. It is well-known that an instance of the HRLQ
problem need not admit a feasible stable matching. In this paper, we consider
the notion of popularity for the HRLQ problem. A matching $M$ is popular if no
other matching $M'$ gets more votes than $M$ when vertices vote between $M$ and
$M'$. When there are no lower quotas, there always exists a stable matching and
it is known that every stable matching is popular.
  We show that in an HRLQ instance, although a feasible stable matching need
not exist, there is always a matching that is popular in the set of feasible
matchings. We give an efficient algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality
matching that is popular amongst all the feasible matchings in an HRLQ
instance.

accretion energy that the planet gained during its formation and hence provides
important constraints to the planet formation process. A planet cools down from
a hot initial state to the present state by losing energy through radiative
emission from its atmosphere. Thus, the atmospheric properties affect the
planetary cooling rate. Previous theories of giant planet cooling assume that
the atmospheric composition is unchanged throughout evolution. Planet formation
theories, however, suggest that the atmospheres especially of ice giants are
rich in heavy elements in the early stages. Those heavy elements include
condensable species such as water, ammonia, and methane, which are expected to
have a great impact on atmospheric temperature and, thus, radiative emission
through latent heat release. In this study we investigate the effect of such
condensation on the planetary emission flux and quantify the impact on the
cooling timescale. We then demonstrate that the latent heat of those species
keeps the atmosphere hot and thus the emission flux high for billions of years,
resulting in acceleration of the cooling of ice giants. This sheds light on the
long-standing problem that Uranus is much less bright than theoretically
predicted and is different in brightness from Neptune in spite of similarity in
mass and radius. Also, we find that young ice giants with highly enriched
atmospheres are much brighter in mid-infrared than those with unenriched
atmospheres. This provides important implication for future direct imaging of
extrasolar ice giants.

class of LB model with lots of advantages over traditional
single-relaxation-time (SRT) LB model. In addition, the computation of strain
rate tensor is crucial in MRT-LB simulations of some complex flows. Up to now,
there are only two formulas to compute the strain rate tensor in the MRT LB
model. One is to compute the strain rate tensor by using non-equilibrium parts
of macroscopic moments (Yu formula). The other is to compute the strain rate
tensor by using non-equilibrium parts of density distribution functions (Chai
formula). The mathematical expressions of these two formulas are so different
that we do not know which formula to choose for computing the strain rate
tensor in MRT LB model. In this paper, we study the relationship of these two
formulas. It is found that Yu formula can be deduced from Chai formula in a
particular procedure. However, these two formulas have their own advantages and
disadvantages. Yu formula is more efficient in the computation aspect while
Chai formula can be applied to more lattice patterns of MRT LB models. It is
also found that deducing Yu formula for a particular lattice pattern from Chai

(NSs). First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence
of dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems
composed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for
NSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the
DEF scalar-tensor theory. Since the binary-pulsar bounds depend on the NS mass
and the EOS, we find that current pulsar-timing observations leave
scalarization windows, i.e., regions of parameter space where scalarization can
still be prominent. Then, we investigate if these scalarization windows could
be closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could be improved by
laser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical)
scalarization sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS)
evolution. For the early inspiral of a BNS carrying constant scalar charge, we
employ a Fisher matrix analysis to show that Advanced LIGO can improve
pulsar-timing constraints for some EOSs, and next-generation detectors, such as
the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, will be able to improve those
bounds for all eleven EOSs. Using the late inspiral of a BNS, we estimate that
for some of the EOSs under consideration the onset of dynamical scalarization
can happen early enough to improve the constraints on the DEF parameters
obtained by combining the five binary pulsars. Thus, in the near future the
complementarity of pulsar timing and direct observations of GWs on the ground
will be extremely valuable in probing gravity theories in the strong-field

two-pion distribution amplitude $\Phi_{\pi\pi}^{\rm P}$. The $P$-wave time-like
form factor $F_{\pi}$ in the resonant regions associated with the
$\rho^\prime(1450)$ and $\rho^{\prime\prime}(1700)$ is estimated based on
available experimental data. The PQCD predictions for the $CP$-averaged
branching ratios of the decays $B_{(s)}\to P\rho^\prime(1450),
P\rho^{\prime\prime}(1700)\to P\pi\pi$ are in the order of $10^{-7} \sim
10^{-9}$. The branching ratios of the two-body decays $B_{(s)}\to
P\rho^\prime(1450), P\rho^{\prime\prime}(1700)$ are extracted from the
corresponding quasi-two-body decay modes. The whole pattern of the pion form
factor-squared $|F_\pi|^2$ measured by {\it BABAR} Collaboration could also be
understood based on our studies. Our PQCD predictions will be tested by the
precise data from the LHCb and the future Belle II experiments.

  by Calculating the Nearest-Neighbor Angular Profile",,,,,"q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Pathologists routinely classify breast tumors according to recurring patterns
of nuclear grades, cytoplasmic coloration, and large-scale morphological
formations (i.e. streams of spindle cells, adenoid islands, etc.). The fact
that there are large-scale morphological formations suggest that tumor cells
still possess the genetic programming to arrange themselves in orderly
patterns. However, small regions of order or subtle patterns of order are
invisible to the human eye. The ability to detect subtle regions of order and
correlate them with clinical outcome and resistance to treatment can enhance
diagnostic efficacy. By measuring the acute angle that results when the line
extending from the longest length within a nucleus intersects with the
corresponding line of an adjacent nucleus, the degree of alignment between two
adjacent nuclei can be measured. Through a series of systematic
transformations, subtle regions of order and disorder within a tumor image can
be quantified and visualized in the form of a heat map. This numerical
transformation of spatial relationships between nuclei within tumors allows for
the detection of subtly ordered regions.

patterns of organization in tumor images that have metaplastic elements, such
as streams of spindle cells [1]. However, metaplastic tumors also have nuclei
that may be aligned like a stream but are not obvious to the pathologist
because the shape of the cytoplasm is unclear. The previous method that I
developed, the Nearest-Neighbor Angular Profile (N-NAP) method [2], is good for
detecting subtle patterns of order based on the assumption that breast tumor
cells are attempting to arrange themselves side-by-side (like bricks), as in
the luminal compartment of a normal mammary gland [3]. However, this assumption
is not optimal for detecting cellular arrangements that are head-to-tail, such
as in streams of spindle cells. Metaplastic carcinomas of the breast (i.e.
basal-like breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancers) are believed to be
derived from the stem or progenitor cells that reside in the
basal/myoepithelial compartment of the normal mammary gland [Reviewed in 3].
Epithelial cells in the basal/myoepithelial compartment arrange themselves in
an head-to-tail fashion, forming a net that surrounds the luminal compartment
[3,4]. If cancer cells in a metaplastic tumor are trying to be normal, the
optimal way to detect subtle regions of them attempting to be ordered normally
should highlight the head-to-tail alignment of cells.

  reconstruction from human brain activity",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CV q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging
results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing
the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main
challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing
fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances.
Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield
dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the
reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in
a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our
joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only
""deep"" in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful
in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The
nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation
ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for
suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational
Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To
further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of
testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the
training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording
datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual
stimuli.

number of existing objective quality metrics to determine how well they can
predict the quality of light fields. We find that the existing image quality
metrics provide good measures of light-field quality, but require dense

which reveals the need for new, light-field-specific metrics.

unordered $n$ points on the Riemann sphere is a quotient space of the Zariski
open set $K_n$ of $\mathbb C^{n-3}$ by an $S_n$ action. The stabilizers of this
$S_n$ action at certain points of this Zariski open set $K_n$ correspond to the
groups fixing the sets of $n$ points on the Riemann sphere. Let $\alpha$ be a
subset of $n$ distinct points on the Riemann sphere. We call the group of all
linear fractional transformations leaving $\alpha$ invariant the stabilizer of
$\alpha$, which is finite by observation. For each non-trivial finite subgroup
$G$ of the group ${\rm PSL}(2,{\Bbb C})$ of linear fractional transformations,
we give the necessary and sufficient condition for finite subsets of the
Riemann sphere under which the stabilizers of them are conjugate to $G$. We
also prove that there does exist some finite subset of the Riemann sphere whose
stabilizer coincides with $G$. Next we obtain the irreducible decompositions of
the representations of the stabilizers on the tangent spaces at the
singularities of $\mathfrak{M_{0,\:n}}$. At last, on $\mathfrak{M_{0,\:5}}$ and
$\mathfrak{M_{0,\:6}}$, we work out explicitly the singularities and the

sparse signals. By formulating integrated dictionary elements spanning bands of
the considered parameter space, one may efficiently find and discard large
parts of the parameter space not active in the signal. After each iteration,
the zero-valued parts of the dictionary may be discarded to allow a refined
dictionary to be formed around the active elements, resulting in a zoomed
dictionary to be used in the following iterations. Implementing this scheme
allows for more accurate estimates, at a much lower computational cost, as
compared to directly forming a larger dictionary spanning the whole parameter
space or performing a zooming procedure using standard dictionary elements.
Different from traditional dictionaries, the wideband dictionary allows for the
use of dictionaries with fewer elements than the number of available samples
without loss of resolution. The technique may be used on both one- and
multi-dimensional signals, and may be exploited to refine several traditional
sparse estimators, here illustrated with the LASSO and the SPICE estimators.
Numerical examples illustrate the improved performance.

R1 position of the bright molecular outflow from NGC1333-IRAS4A. The [OI] 63 um
line is detected and spectrally resolved. From an intensity peak at +15 km/s,
the intensity decreases until +50 km/s. The profile is similar to that of
high-velocity (HV) H2O and CO 16-15, the latter observed simultaneously with
[OI]. A radiative transfer analysis suggests that ~15% of the oxygen is in

the Perseus star-forming complex. We build on previous starless core,
protostellar core, and young stellar object (YSO) catalogs from Spitzer,
Herschel, and SCUBA observations in the literature. We place the cores and YSOs
within seven star-forming clumps based on column densities greater than 5x10^21
cm^-2. We calculate the mean density and free-fall time for 69 starless cores
as 5.55x10^-19 gcm^-3 and 0.1 Myr,respectively, and we estimate the star
formation rate for the near future as 150 Msun Myr^-1. According to Bonnor
Ebert stability analysis, we find that majority of starless cores in Perseus
are unstable. Broadly, these cores can collapse to form the next generation of
stars. We found a relation between starless cores and YSOs, where the numbers
of young protostars (Class 0 + Class I) are similar to the numbers of starless
cores. This similarity, which shows a one-to-one relation, suggests that these
starless cores may form the next generation of stars with approximately the
same formation rate as the current generation, as identified by the Class 0 and
Class I protostars. It follows that if such a relation between starless cores
and any YSO stage exists, the SFR values of these two populations must be
nearly constant. In brief, we propose that this one-to-one relation is an
important factor in better understanding the star formation process within a
cloud.

However, even with the present variety of characteristics at hand it still
remains a subject of current research to appropriately quantify a network's
complexity and correspondingly discriminate between different types of complex
networks, like infrastructure or social networks, on such a basis. Here, we
explore the possibility to classify complex networks by means of a statistical
complexity measure that has formerly been successfully applied to distinguish
different types of chaotic and stochastic time series. It is composed of a
network's averaged per-node entropic measure characterizing the network's
information content and the associated Jenson-Shannon divergence as a measure
of disequilibrium. We study 29 real world networks and show that networks of
the same category tend to cluster in distinct areas of the resulting
complexity-entropy plane. We demonstrate that within our framework, connectome
networks exhibit among the highest complexity while, e.g, transportation and
infrastructure networks display significantly lower values. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to families of random
scale-free and Watts-Strogatz model networks. We then show in a second
application that the proposed framework is useful to objectively construct
threshold-based networks, such as functional climate networks or recurrence
networks, by choosing the threshold such that the statistical network
complexity is maximized.

means of the time-frequency analysis of surrogate data, our approach is able to
identify and filter automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in

nated EEG signals, the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of noise removal and
signal distortion was superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel
EEG denoising techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical correlation
analysis combined with an advanced version of the empirical mode decomposition.
Even in the presence of mild and severe artifacts, our artifact removal method
provides a relative error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques.
Significance: In view of these results, the SuBAR method is a promising
solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory healthcare systems, sleep

gamma-ray-burst (LGRB) host galaxies cover different redshift domains. N/O in
SN hosts increases due to secondary N production towards low z (0.01)
accompanying the growing trend of active galaxies (AGN, LINER). N/O in LGRB
hosts decreases rapidly between z>1 and z ~0.1 following the N/H trend and
reach the characteristic N/O ratios calculated for the HII regions in local and
nearby galaxies. The few short period GRB (SGRB) hosts included in the galaxy
sample show N/H <0.04 solar and O/H solar. They seem to continue the low bound
N/H trend of SN hosts at z<0.3. The distribution of N/O as function of
metallicity for SN and LGRB hosts is compared with star chemical evolution
models. The results show that several LGRB hosts can be explained by star
multi-bursting models when 12+log(O/H) <8.5, while some objects follow the
trend of continuous star formation models. N/O in SN hosts at log(O/H)+12 <8.5
are not well explained by stellar chemical evolution models calculated for
starburst galaxies. At 12+log(O/H) >8.5 many different objects are nested close
to O/H solar with N/O ranging between the maximum corresponding to starburst
galaxies and AGN and the minimum corresponding to HII regions and SGRB.

essential to optimally integrate wind energy into power systems. We build
spatio-temporal models for wind power generation and obtain full probabilistic
forecasts from 15 minutes to 5 hours ahead. Detailed analysis of the forecast
performances on the individual wind farms and aggregated wind power are

aggregated wind power by utilizing spatio-temporal correlations among
individual wind farms. Furthermore, spatio-temporal models have the advantage
of being able to produce spatially out-of-sample forecasts. We evaluate the
predictions on a data set from wind farms in western Denmark and compare the
spatio-temporal model with an autoregressive model containing a common
autoregressive parameter for all wind farms, identifying the specific cases
when it is important to have a spatio-temporal model instead of a temporal one.
This case study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain fast and accurate
forecasts of wind power generation at wind farms where data is available, but
also at a larger portfolio including wind farms at new locations. The results
and the methodologies are relevant for wind power forecasts across the globe as

transmission in a wide range of communication applications. However, most of
the advances in the design of high speed wireless multiple-input multiple
output (MIMO) systems are based on information-theoretic principles that
demonstrate how to efficiently transmit signals conforming to Gaussian
distribution. Although the Gaussian signal is capacity-achieving, signals
conforming to discrete constellations are transmitted in practical
communication systems. As a result, this paper is motivated to provide a
comprehensive overview on MIMO transmission design with discrete input signals.
We first summarize the existing fundamental results for MIMO systems with
discrete input signals. Then, focusing on the basic point-to-point MIMO
systems, we examine transmission schemes based on three most important criteria
for communication systems: the mutual information driven designs, the mean
square error driven designs, and the diversity driven designs. Particularly, a
unified framework which designs low complexity transmission schemes applicable
to massive MIMO systems in upcoming 5G wireless networks is provided in the
first time. Moreover, adaptive transmission designs which switch among these
criteria based on the channel conditions to formulate the best transmission
strategy are discussed. Then, we provide a survey of the transmission designs
with discrete input signals for multiuser MIMO scenarios, including MIMO uplink
transmission, MIMO downlink transmission, MIMO interference channel, and MIMO
wiretap channel. Additionally, we discuss the transmission designs with
discrete input signals for other systems using MIMO technology. Finally,
technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are
summarized and the future trends of transmission designs with discrete input
signals are addressed.

sampling theorem. In contrast, here we consider a transceiver that by design
violates the common paradigm $B\leq f_s$. To this end, at the receiver, we
allow for a higher pre-filter bandwidth $B>f_s$ and study the achievable
parameter estimation accuracy under a fixed sampling rate when the transmit and
receive filter are jointly optimized with respect to the Bayesian
Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound. For the case of delay-Doppler estimation, we
propose to approximate the required Fisher information matrix and solve the
transceiver design problem by an alternating optimization algorithm. The

transmit and receive filters which are favorable under a weighted mean squared

connectivity. Thus, there has been a great interest in understanding how to
control percolation, the transition to large-scale connectivity. Previous work,
however, studied control strategies assuming unlimited resources. Here, we
depart from this unrealistic assumption and consider the effect of limited
resources on the effectiveness of control. We show that, even for scarce
resources, percolation can be controlled with an efficient intervention
strategy. We derive this strategy and study its implications, revealing a
discontinuous transition as an unintended side-effect of optimal control.

letter of the alphabet a probability of occurrence of this letter at this
position is specified. Weighted sequences are commonly used to represent
imprecise or uncertain data, for example, in molecular biology where they are
known under the name of Position-Weight Matrices. Given a probability threshold
$\frac1z$, we say that a string $P$ of length $m$ occurs in a weighted sequence
$X$ at position $i$ if the product of probabilities of the letters of $P$ at
positions $i,\ldots,i+m-1$ in $X$ is at least $\frac1z$. In this article, we
consider an \emph{indexing} variant of the problem, in which we are to
preprocess a weighted sequence to answer multiple pattern matching queries. We
present an $O(nz)$-time construction of an $O(nz)$-sized index for a weighted
sequence of length $n$ over a constant-sized alphabet that answers pattern
matching queries in optimal, $O(m+Occ)$ time, where $Occ$ is the number of

construction of a family of $\lfloor z \rfloor$ special strings that carries
the information about all the strings that occur in the weighted sequence with
a sufficient probability. We obtain a weighted index with the same complexities
as in the most efficient previously known index by Barton et al. (CPM 2016),
but our construction is significantly simpler. The most complex algorithmic
tool required in the basic form of our index is the suffix tree which we use to
develop a new, more straightforward index for the so-called property matching
problem. We provide an implementation of our data structure. Our construction
allows us also to obtain a significant improvement over the complexities of the

the suspicious link's two-hop nature, the monitor can adaptively choose among
the following three eavesdropping modes to improve the eavesdropping

the message collectively, (II) \emph{proactive eavesdropping} via {\emph{noise

{\emph{hybrid jamming}} over the second hop. In both proactive eavesdropping
modes, the (noise/hybrid) jamming over one hop is for the purpose of reducing
the end-to-end communication rate of the suspicious link and accordingly making
the interception more easily over the other hop. Under this setup, we maximize
the eavesdropping rate at the monitor by jointly optimizing the eavesdropping
mode selection as well as the transmit power for noise and hybrid jamming.
Numerical results show that the eavesdropping mode selection significantly

which $u$ has vanishing mean oscillation at all points. But it is not known
whether all points outside this jump set are Lebesgue points, as they would be
for $BV$ solutions. In the present article we show that the set of non-Lebesgue
points of $u$ has Hausdorff dimension at most one. In contrast with the
aforementioned structure result, we need only one particular entropy production
to be a finite Radon measure, namely $\mu=\partial_t
(u^2/2)+\partial_x(u^3/3)$. We prove H\""older regularity at points where $\mu$
has finite $(1+\alpha)$-dimensional upper density for some $\alpha>0$. The
proof is inspired by a result of De Lellis, Westdickenberg and the second
author : if $\mu_+$ has vanishing 1-dimensional upper density, then $u$ is an
entropy solution. We obtain a quantitative version of this statement: if
$\mu_+$ is small then $u$ is close in $L^1$ to an entropy solution.

networks depicting functional relationships between brain areas, has opened new
insights into the function of the human brain. In this approach, the choice of
network nodes is of crucial importance. One option is to consider fMRI voxels
as nodes. This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and
interpretation of results challenging. A common alternative is to use
pre-defined clusters of anatomically close voxels, Regions of Interest (ROIs).
This approach assumes that voxels within ROIs are functionally similar. Because
these two approaches result in different network structures, it is crucial to
understand what happens to network connectivity when moving from the voxel
level to the ROI level. We show that the consistency of ROIs, defined as the
mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of their voxels,
varies widely in resting-state experimental data. Therefore the assumption of
similar voxel dynamics within each ROI does not generally hold. Further, the
time series of low-consistency ROIs may be highly correlated, resulting in
spurious links in ROI-level networks. Based on these results, we recommend that
averaging BOLD signals over anatomically defined ROIs should be carefully
considered.

rewritten in terms of cosine and sine functions in order to get a clear picture
of how the photon states relate to the $\boldsymbol A$ field. The phase
operator, defined by $\hat E = \exp(-i \hat \phi)$, is derived from this
picture. The result has a close resemblance with the known Susskind-Glogower
(SG) operator, which is given by $\hat E_{SG}=(\hat a_{\boldsymbol k} \hat

that $\hat a_{\boldsymbol k}$ should be replaced by $(\hat a_{\boldsymbol k} +

also be analyzed when restricted to the space of only forward moving photons

Whereas $E_{SG}$ can be equivalently written as $\hat E_{SG} =

between-group effect or within-subject effect were created and 5,000 random
samples of each population were drawn. Finally, the mean Type I error rates for
Multilevel linear models (MLM) with an unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN),
MLM with compound-symmetry (MLM-CS) and for repeated measures analysis of
variance (rANOVA) models (without correction, with
Greenhouse-Geisser-correction, and Huynh-Feldt-correction) were computed. To
examine the effect of both the sample size and the number of measurement

a massive progressive bias for small sample sizes (n =20) and m = 6 or more
measurement occasions. This effect could not be found in previous simulation

rates for rANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser-correction demonstrate a small
conservative bias if sphericity was not violated, sample sizes were small (n =

for a use of rANOVA with Huynh-Feldt-correction, especially when the sphericity

Magellanic Cloud (SMC); about half of them are pulsating with periods from a
few to hundreds of seconds. SXP 1323 is one of the longest-period pulsars known
in this galaxy. Aims. SXP 1323 is in the field of view of a large set of
calibration observations that we analyse systematically, focusing on the time
analysis, in search of periodic signals. Methods. We analyse all available
X-ray observations of SXP 1323 from Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, in the
time range from 1999 to the end of 2016. We perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram
search in the band 2.5-10 keV on all observations to detect the neutron star
spin period and constrain its long-term evolution. We also perform an orbital
period search on the long-term light curve, merging all datasets. Results. We
report the discovery of a 26.188+-0.045 d period analysing data from Suzaku,
XMM-Newton, and Chandra, which confirms the optical period derived from the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) data. If this corresponds to
the orbital period, this would be very short with respect to what is expected
from the spin/orbital period relationship. We furthermore report on the spin
period evolution in the last years. The source is spinning-up with an average
rate of Pdot/P of 0.018 yr-1, decreasing from 1340 to 1100 s, in the period
from 2006 to the end of 2016, which is also extreme with respect to the other
Be/X-ray pulsars. From 2010 to the end of 2014, the pulse period is not clearly
detectable, although the source was still bright. Conclusions. SXP 1323 is a
peculiar BeXB due to its long pulse period, rapid spin-up for several years,
and short orbital period. A continuous monitoring of the source in the next
years is necessary to establish the long-term behaviour of the spin period.

theoretical framework suitable for studying pairwise interactions within a
large collection of simple indistinguishable entities, frequently called
agents. In this paper the emphasis is on the space complexity in fast leader
election via population protocols governed by the random scheduler, which
uniformly at random selects pairwise interactions within the population of n
agents.
  The main result of this paper is a new fast and space optimal leader election
protocol. The new protocol utilises O(log^2 n) parallel time (which is
equivalent to O(n log^2 n) sequential pairwise interactions), and each agent
operates on O(log log n) states. This double logarithmic space usage matches
asymptotically the lower bound 1/2 log log n on the minimal number of states
required by agents in any leader election algorithm with the running time
o(n/polylog n).
  Our solution takes an advantage of the concept of phase clocks, a fundamental
synchronisation and coordination tool in distributed computing. We propose a
new fast and robust population protocol for initialisation of phase clocks to
be run simultaneously in multiple modes and intertwined with the leader
election process. We also provide the reader with the relevant formal
argumentation indicating that our solution is always correct, and fast with

In this light we revisit the covariant action for M5-branes by adding explicit
axion terms. This leads to a new gauge symmetry and simple modification of some
field equations and the constraints in the theory. The equations of motion
include a conserved toplological current of I-strings. When 6D theory is
compactified on a circle the light-like I-strings manifest as heavy monopole

degenerate with the M5 vacuum but only at strong SYM coupling. This indicates

and SSI) variability entitled EMPirical Irradiance REconstruction (EMPIRE). As
with existing empirical models, TSI and SSI variability is given by the linear
combination of solar activity indices. In empirical models, UV SSI variability
is usually determined by fitting the rotational variability in activity indices
to that in measurements. Such models have to date relied on ordinary least
squares regression, which ignores the uncertainty in the activity indices. In
an advance from earlier efforts, the uncertainty in the activity indices is
accounted for in EMPIRE by the application of an error-in-variables regression
scheme, making the resultant UV SSI variability more robust. The result is
consistent with observations and unprecedentedly, with that from other
modelling approaches, resolving the long-standing controversy between existing
empirical models and other types of models. We demonstrate that earlier
empirical models, by neglecting the uncertainty in activity indices,
underestimate UV SSI variability. The reconstruction of TSI and visible and IR
SSI from EMPIRE is also shown to be consistent with observations. The EMPIRE
reconstruction is of utility to climate studies as a more robust alternative to
earlier empirical reconstructions.

whether such zeros can be tied to the dynamics of physically relevant
observables and hence order parameters in the systems. For this we first
numerically analyze the dynamics of a hard-core boson gas in a one-dimensional
waveguide when a quenched lattice potential is commensurate with the particle
density. Such a system can undergo a pinning transition to an insulating state
and we find non-analytic behavior in the evolution of the rate function which
is indicative of dynamical phase transitions. In addition, we perform
simulations of the time dependence of the momentum distribution and compare the
periodicity of this collapse and revival cycle to that of the non-analyticities
in the rate function: the two are found to be closely related only for deep
quenches. We then confirm this observation by analytic calculations on a
closely related discrete model of hard-core bosons in the presence of a
staggered potential and find expressions for the rate function for the
quenches. By extraction of the zeros of the Loschmidt amplitude we uncover a
non-equilibrium timescale for the emergence of non-analyticities and discuss

filtering zero-mean white noise and they admit a well-defined power spectrum
whose shape is determined by the frequency response of the graph filter.
Estimating the graph power spectrum forms an important component of stationary
graph signal processing and related inference tasks such as Wiener prediction
or inpainting on graphs. The central result of this paper is that by sampling a
significantly smaller subset of vertices and using simple least squares, we can
reconstruct the second-order statistics of the graph signal from the subsampled
observations, and more importantly, without any spectral priors. To this end,
both a nonparametric approach as well as parametric approaches including moving
average and autoregressive models for the graph power spectrum are considered.
The results specialize for undirected circulant graphs in that the graph nodes
leading to the best compression rates are given by the so-called minimal sparse
rulers. A near-optimal greedy algorithm is developed to design the subsampling
scheme for the non-parametric and the moving average models, whereas a
particular subsampling scheme that allows linear estimation for the
autoregressive model is proposed. Numerical experiments on synthetic as well as
real datasets related to climatology and processing handwritten digits are
provided to demonstrate the developed theory.

surprising changes in their number of equilibria, limit cycles and/or their
stability types when the controllers slightly vary in the vicinity of critical
parameter varieties. Each such a change is called a local bifurcation. We
derive novel results with regards to truncated parametric normal form
classification of the generalized cusp plants. Then, we suggest effective
nonlinear bifurcation control law designs for precisely locating and accurately
controlling many different types of bifurcations for two measurable plants from
this family. The first is a general quadratic plant with a possible multi-input
linear controller while the second is a Z_2-equivariant general plant with
possible multi-input linear (Z_2-symmetry preserving) and quadratic
(symmetry-breaking) controllers. The bifurcations include from primary to
quinary bifurcations of either of the following types: saddle-node,
transcritical and pitchfork of equilibria, Z_2-equivariant bifurcations of
multiple limit cycles through Hopf, homoclinic, heteroclinic, saddle-node, and
saddle-connection, and finally their one-parameter symmetry breaking
bifurcations. Using our parametric normal form analysis, we propose a new
approach for efficient treatment of tracking and regulating engineering
problems with smooth manoeuvering possiblities. Due to the nonlinearity of a
ship maneuvering characteristic, there is a need for a controller design in a
ship steering system so that the ship follows a desired sea route. The results
in bifurcation control analysis are applied to two nonlinear ship course models
for such controller designs. Symbolic implementations in Maple and numerical
simulations in MATLAB confirm our theoretical results and accurate predictions.

that the presence of metallic state in such superlattices accompanies
structural phase transition with restoring of inversion symmetry. Further study
shows that this strain-induced structural transition makes the $d$ energy level
of the interfacial Ti atoms of the YTO layer move upward due to the decreasing
of the TiO$_{6}$ octahedral volume and induces the electron reconstruction in
the whole superlattice systems. In addition, when the on-site interaction $U$
is changed from 5 to 4 eV, a similar insulator-metal transition also occurs in
such superlattices due to the weakened electron correlation. These findings can
improve our understanding of the insulator-metal transitions in such oxide

not only on planets, but on satellites, as well. My research focuses on three
closely related topics. The first one is the circumstellar habitable zone,
which is usually used as a first proxy for determining the habitability of a
planet around the host star. The word habitability is used in the sense that
liquid water, which is essential for life as we know it, may be present on the
planetary surface. Whether the planet is habitable or not, its moon might have
a suitable surface temperature for holding water reservoirs, providing that
tidal heating is in action. Tidal heating is generated inside the satellite and
its source is the strong gravitational force of the nearby planet. The second
topic of my research explores tidal heating and the habitability of extra-solar
moons with and without stellar radiation and other related energy sources. Life
is possible to form even on icy planetary bodies, inside tidally heated
subsurface oceans. The third topic probes the possibility of identifying an
ice-covered satellite from photometric observations. A strong indication of
surface ice is the high reflectance of the body, which may be measured when the
moon disappears behind the host star, so its reflected light is blocked out by
the star.

Relations Observatory (STEREO) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and coronagraph
images. We then use the Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model
for nonradial CME dynamics driven by magnetic forces, to simulate the
deflection and rotation of the seven CMEs. We find good agreement between the
ForeCAT results and the reconstructed CME positions and orientations. The CME
deflections range in magnitude between 10 degrees and 30 degrees. All CMEs
deflect to the north but we find variations in the direction of the
longitudinal deflection. The rotations range between 5\mydeg and 50\mydeg with
both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations occurring. Three of the CMEs
begin with initial positions within 2 degrees of one another. These three CMEs
all deflect primarily northward, with some minor eastward deflection, and
rotate counterclockwise. Their final positions and orientations, however,
respectively differ by 20 degrees and 30 degrees. This variation in deflection
and rotation results from differences in the CME expansion and radial
propagation close to the Sun, as well as the CME mass. Ultimately, only one of
these seven CMEs yielded discernible in situ signatures near Earth, despite the
active region facing near Earth throughout the eruptions. We suggest that the
differences in the deflection and rotation of the CMEs can explain whether each

account. Through comparative study of the best-fitting model predicted star

whether or not the isolated galaxies follow similar evolution history. Our
results show that these three galaxies accumulated more than 50 percent of

gradients in isolated spiral galaxies NGC\,2403 and NGC\,300 are similar and
obviously steeper than that in M33, when the metallicity gradients are

about 5 times larger than the previously known NLSy1 galaxies. Their
monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100 A is found to be strongly correlated
with H-beta, H-alpha, and [O III] emission line luminosities. The optical Fe II
strength in NLSy1 galaxies is about two times larger than the broad- line
Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. About 5% of the catalog sources are detected in the
FIRST survey. The Eddington ratio (XEdd) of NLSy1 galaxies has an average of
log XEdd of -0.34, much higher than -1.03 found for BLSy1 galaxies. Their black
hole masses (MBH) have an average of log MBH of 6.9 Msun, which is less than
BLSy1 galaxies, which have an average of log MBH of 8.0 Msun. The MBH of NLSy1
galaxies is found to be correlated with their host galaxy velocity dispersion.
Our analysis suggests that geometrical effects playing an important role in

with mass accretion rate fluctuations propagating towards the black hole. Such
models predict time lags between energy bands due to propagation delays. First
application of a propagating fluctuations model to black hole power spectra
showed good agreement with the data. Indeed, hard lags observed from these
systems appear to be in agreement with this generic prediction. Our PROPFLUC
code allows to simultaneously predict power spectra, time lags, and coherence
of the variability as a function of energy. This was successfully applied to
Swift data on the black hole MAXIJ1659-152, fitting jointly the power spectra
in two energy bands and the cross-spectrum between these two bands. In the
current work, we attempt to to model two high signal to noise Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of the black hole XTE J1550-564. We find
that neither observation can be adequately explained by the model even when
considering, additionally to previous PROPFLUC versions, different propagation
speeds of the fluctuations. After extensive exploration of model extensions, we
tentatively conclude that the quantitative and qualitative discrepancy between
model predictions and data is generic to the propagating fluctuations paradigm.
This result encourages further investigation of the fundamental hypotheses of
the propagating fluctuations model. We discuss some of these hypotheses with an

to separate an observed signal into two or more components each with its own

non-additive. For example, an image may consist of a foreground object overlaid

to solve a binary optimization problem. Since most of the binary optimization
problems are intractable, we relax this problem to the approximated continuous
problem, and solve it by alternating optimization technique. We show the
application of the proposed algorithm for three applications: separation of

objects, giving thus similar long-lived axial gravitational modes. These
long-lived linear perturbations are related to the stable circular null
geodesic and due to additional non-linear phenomena could lead to conversion of
the trapping zone to a black hole. We give in the eikonal limit examples of the
long-lived gravitational modes, their oscillatory frequencies and slow damping
rates, for the trapping zones of the polytropes with $N \in (2.138,4)$.
However, in the trapping polytropes the long-lived damped modes exist only for
very large values of the multipole number $\ell>50$, while for smaller values
of $\ell$ the numerical calculations indicate existence of fast growing
unstable axial gravitational modes. We demonstrate that for polytropes with $N

polytrope, and the mass contained in the trapping zone is about $10^{-3}$ of

the cobalt-cobalt interaction is stronger than the cobalt-carbon one. However,
the interaction with cobalt clusters induce small magnetic moment on

Wick rotated Euclidean theory. We show that, under certain conditions, the $S$
matrix is unitary when the cosmological constant vanishes. The model is the
simplest of its class. However, infinitely many similar options are allowed,
which raises the issue of uniqueness. To deal with this problem, we propose a
new quantization prescription, by doubling the unphysical poles of the
higher-derivative propagators and turning them into Lee-Wick poles. The
Lagrangian of the simplest theory of quantum gravity based on this idea is the
linear combination of $R$, $R_{\mu \nu }R^{\mu \nu }$, $R^{2}$ and the
cosmological term. Only the graviton propagates in the cutting equations and,
when the cosmological constant vanishes, the $S$ matrix is unitary. The theory
satisfies the locality of counterterms and is renormalizable by power counting.
It is unique in the sense that it is the only one with a dimensionless gauge
coupling.

constraints avoid overfitting of nonparametric ICCs by keeping them close to

conducted computational experiments to assess the effectiveness of our

demonstrate that our model obtained more accurate estimation results than did

subsets of G one can choose a point x_n in U_n for all n in such a way that the
resulting sequence {x_n:n in N} has a p-limit in G, that is, {n in N: x_n in V}
belongs to p for every neighbourhood V of x in G. In particular, G is
selectively pseudocompact (strongly pseudocompact) but not selectively
sequentially pseudocompact. This answers a question of Dorantes-Aldama and the

over any disjoint sum of maximal countable spaces contains no infinite compact

investigate the case where instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the
eavesdropper is known at the transmitter. We show analytically that a
generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) based design, which is optimal
for Gaussian inputs, may exhibit a severe performance loss for finite alphabet
inputs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In light of this, we
propose a novel Per-Group-GSVD (PG-GSVD) design which can effectively
compensate the performance loss caused by the GSVD design. More importantly,
the computational complexity of the PG-GSVD design is by orders of magnitude
lower than that of the existing design for finite alphabet inputs in [1] while
the resulting performance loss is minimal. Then, we extend the PG-GSVD design
to the case where only statistical CSI of the eavesdropper is available at the
transmitter. Numerical results indicate that the proposed PG-GSVD design can be
efficiently implemented in large-scale multiple-antenna systems and achieves
significant performance gains compared to the GSVD design.

reinforced with 0.5 wt. % (Composite 1) and 1.0 wt.% (Composite 2) continuous
stainless steel composite. In Composite 1 the microstructure displayed poor
bonding between matrix and reinforcement interface. Poor bonding associated
with large voids also can be seen in Composite 1. The results also showed that
coarser eutectic silicon (Si) particles were less intensified around the
matrix-reinforcement interface. From energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS)
elemental mapping, it was clearly shown that the distribution of eutectic Si
particles were less concentrated at poor bonding regions associated with large
voids. Meanwhile in Composite 2, the microstructure displayed good bonding
combined with more concentrated finer eutectic Si particles around the
matrix-reinforcement interface. From EDS elemental mapping, it was clearly
showed more concentrated of eutectic Si particles were distributed at the good
bonding area. The superheating prior to casting has influenced the
microstructure and tends to produce finer, rounded and preferred oriented
{\alpha}-Al dendritic structures.

to discover a process model based on business process execution data. A
majority of process discovery techniques relies on an event log as an input. An
event log is a static source of historical data capturing the execution of a
business process. In this paper we focus on process discovery relying on online
streams of business process execution events. Learning process models from
event streams poses both challenges and opportunities, i.e. we need to handle
unlimited amounts of data using finite memory and, preferably, constant time.
We propose a generic architecture that allows for adopting several classes of
existing process discovery techniques in context of event streams. Moreover, we
provide several instantiations of the architecture, accompanied by
implementations in the process mining tool-kit ProM (http://promtools.org).
Using these instantiations, we evaluate several dimensions of stream-based
process discovery. The evaluation shows that the proposed architecture allows
us to lift process discovery to the streaming domain.

rigid two-electron molecule in weak confinement and we further present a

and a simplified version of the game that is interesting because it has three
distinct equilibrium solutions. For one-third street Kuhn poker, we are able to
find all of the equilibrium solutions analytically. For large enough pot size,
$P$, there is a degree of freedom in the solution that allows one player to
transfer profit between the other two players without changing their own
profit. This has potentially interesting consequences in repeated play of the
game. We also show that in a simplified version of the game with $P>5$, there
is one equilibrium solution if $5 < P < P^* \equiv (5+\sqrt{73})/2$, and three
distinct equilibrium solutions if $P > P^*$. This may be the simplest
non-trivial multiplayer poker game with more than one distinct equilibrium
solution and provides us with a test case for theories of dynamic strategy
adjustment over multiple realisations of the game.
  We then study a third order system of ordinary differential equations that
models the dynamics of three players who try to maximise their expectation by
continuously varying their betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics of
this system are oscillatory, with two distinct types of solution. We then study
a difference equation model, based on repeated play of the game, in which each
player continually updates their estimates of the other players' betting
frequencies. We find that the dynamics are noisy, but basically oscillatory for
short enough estimation periods and slow enough frequency adjustments, but that
the dynamics can be very different for other parameter values.

perform more capable processing for $W$-state creation protocols. We use four

we show that the proposed scheme can be implemented by operating the quantum
optical gates which can be realized via current photonics technology.

carbon is commonly used as highly effective absorbent. Carbon of different
morphologies and structures normally demonstrate distinct capabilities to
adsorption-typed decontaminations. Graphene oxide is regarded as the oxidative
derivative of graphene, maintaining its 2D morphology-featuring structure while
location-dependently immobilized with a large amount of various
oxygen-involving functional moieties on both sides. Free-standing graphene
oxide tends to fully unfold in water and behave in macromolecular-like Brownian
motion. Therefore, high-performance adsorption occurs during the process of
interacting with large amount of sorbates, during which an unevenness of
effective adsorptive site distribution turns out for targeted matter due to
functional group-to-sorbate interaction mechanism differentiation as well as
groups'inherent location specifications. Thus, oriented manipulation of
surficial functional moieties and their site distribution is potentially a way
to further enhance the adsorptive performances, and this could go even better
if considering combining adsorption and an in-situ manipulation at the same
time.

for computation. In this paper, we use the time series data of the healthcare
sector of India for the period January 2010 till December 2016. We first
demonstrate a decomposition approach of the time series and then illustrate how
the decomposition results provide us with useful insights into the behavior and
properties exhibited by the time series. Further, based on the structural
analysis of the time series, we propose six different methods of forecasting
for predicting the time series index of the healthcare sector. Extensive
results are provided on the performance of the forecasting methods to
demonstrate their effectiveness.

Three US soil point datasetswere combined with a stack of over 200
environmental datasets to generate complete coverage gridded predictions at 100
m spatial resolution of soil properties (percent organic C, total N, bulk
density, pH, and percent sand and clay) and US soil taxonomic classes (291
great groups and 78 modified particle size classes) for the conterminous US.
Models were built using parallelized random forest and gradient boosting
algorithms. Soil property predictions were generated at seven standard soil
depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm). Prediction probability maps for US
soil taxonomic classifications were also generated. Model validation results
indicate an out-of-bag classification accuracy of 60 percent for great groups,
and 66 percent for modified particle size classes; for soil properties
cross-validated R-square ranged from 62 percent for total N to 87 percent for
pH. Nine independent validation datasets were used to assess prediction
accuracies for soil class models and results ranged between 24-58 percent and
24-93 percent for great group and modified particle size class prediction
accuracies, respectively. The hybrid ""SoilGrids+"" modeling system that
incorporates remote sensing data, local predictions of soil properties,
conventional soil polygon maps, and machine learning opens the possibility for
updating conventional soil survey data with machine learning technology to make
soil information easier to integrate with spatially explicit models, compared
to multi-component map units.
