drift-diffusion description, including the spin Hall effect, is integrated with
a magnetisation dynamics solver. The resulting model is shown to simultaneously
reproduce the spin-orbit torques generated using the spin Hall effect, spin
pumping torques generated by magnetisation dynamics in multilayers, as well as
the spin transfer torques acting on magnetisation regions with spatial
gradients, whilst field-like and spin-like torques are reproduced in a spin
valve geometry. Two approaches to modelling interfaces are analysed, one based
on the spin mixing conductance and the other based on continuity of spin
currents where the spin dephasing length governs the absorption of transverse
spin components. In both cases analytical formulas are derived for the
spin-orbit torques in a heavy metal / ferromagnet bilayer geometry, showing in
general both field-like and damping-like torques are generated. The limitations
of the analytical approach are discussed, showing that even in a simple bilayer
geometry, due to the non-uniformity of the spin currents, a full
three-dimensional treatment is required. Finally the model is applied to the
quantitative analysis of the spin Hall angle in Pt by reproducing published
experimental data on the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth in the bilayer
geometry.

cybercriminals to navigate webmail accounts and locate sensitive information in
them. To this end, we configured thirty Gmail honeypot accounts with English,
Romanian, and Greek language settings. We populated the accounts with email
messages in those languages by subscribing them to selected online newsletters.
We hid email messages about fake bank accounts in fifteen of the accounts to
mimic real-world webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in
their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey accounts via paste
sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, and collected data for fifteen days.
Our statistical analyses on the data show that cybercriminals are more likely
to discover sensitive information (bank account information) in the Greek
accounts than the remaining accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek
ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek visitors to the
Greek accounts. We also extracted the important words among the emails that
cybercriminals accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they searched
for within the honey accounts), and found that financial terms featured among
the top words. In summary, we show that language plays a significant role in
the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive information hidden in

field was measured at the surface of $\alpha$ Ori and this is so far the only
M-type supergiant for which a direct detection of a surface magnetic field has
been reported. By extending the search for surface magnetic field in a sample
of late-type supergiants, we want to determine whether the surface magnetic
field detected on $\alpha$ Ori is a common feature among the M-type
supergiants. With the spectropolarimeter Narval at TBL we undertook a search
for surface magnetic fields in a sample of cool supergiant stars, and we
analysed circular polarisation spectra using the least-squares deconvolution
technique. We detect weak Zeeman signatures of stellar origin in the targets CE
Tau, $\alpha^1$ Her and $\mu$ Cep. For the latter star, we also show that
cross-talk from the strong linear polarisation signals detected on this star
must be taken into account. For CE Tau and $\mu$ Cep, the longitudinal
component of the detected surface fields is at the Gauss-level, such as in
$\alpha$~Ori. We measured a longitudinal field almost an order of magnitude
stronger for $\alpha^1$ Her. We also report variability of the longitudinal
magnetic field of CE Tau and $\alpha^1$ Her, with changes in good agreement
with the typical atmospheric dynamics time-scales. We also report a
non-detection of magnetic field at the surface of the yellow supergiant star
$\rho$ Cas. The two RSG stars of our sample, CE Tau and $\mu$ Cep, display
magnetic fields very similar to that of $\alpha$ Ori. The non-detection of a
magnetic field on the post-RSG star $\rho$ Cas suggests that the magnetic field
disappears, or at least becomes undetectable with present methods, at later
evolutionary stages. Our analysis of $\alpha^1$ Her supports the proposed
reclassification of the star as an AGB star.

single-output (MISO) downlink system that seeks to mitigate the impact of the
imperfections in the channel state information (CSI) that is available at the
base station (BS). The goal of the design is to minimize the outage probability
of specified signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) targets, while
satisfying per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs), and to do so at a low
computational cost. Based on insights from the offset maximization technique
for robust beamforming, and observations regarding the structure of the
optimality conditions, low-complexity iterative algorithms that involve the
evaluation of closed-form expressions are developed. To further reduce the
computational cost, algorithms are developed for per-antenna power-constrained
variants of the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT)
beamforming directions. In the MRT case, our low-complexity version for systems
with a large number of antennas may be of independent interest. The proposed
algorithms are extended to systems with both PAPCs and a total power
constraint. Simulation results show that the proposed robust designs can
provide substantial gains in the outage probability while satisfying the PAPCs.

to a reverse entropy power inequality with an explicit constant, and to new
bounds on the rate-distortion function and the channel capacity.
  Specifically, we study the rate-distortion function for log-concave sources
and distortion measure $| x - \hat x|^r$, and we establish that the difference
between the rate distortion function and the Shannon lower bound is at most
$\log(\sqrt{\pi e}) \approx 1.5$ bits, independently of $r$ and the target
distortion $d$. For mean-square error distortion, the difference is at most
$\log (\sqrt{\frac{\pi e}{2}}) \approx 1$ bits, regardless of $d$.
  We also provide bounds on the capacity of memoryless additive noise channels
when the noise is log-concave. We show that the difference between the capacity
of such channels and the capacity of the Gaussian channel with the same noise
power is at most $\log (\sqrt{\frac{\pi e}{2}}) \approx 1$ bits.

a physical interaction Hamiltonian including monopolar, dipolar and Born
(self-energy) contributions derived from linear electrostatic theory of the
unperturbed homogeneous hydrogel, we have identified five different sorption
states of the system, from complete repulsion of the molecule to its full
sorption deep inside the hydrogel, passing through meta- and stable surface
adsorption states. The results are summarized in state diagrams that also
explore the effects of varying the electrolyte concentration, the sign of the
net electric charge of the biomolecule, and the role of including
excluded-volume (steric) or hydrophobic biomolecule-hydrogel interactions. We
show that the dipole moment of the biomolecule is a key parameter controlling
the spatial distribution of the globules. In particular, biomolecules with a
large dipole moment tend to be adsorbed at the external surface of the
hydrogel, even if like-charged, whereas uniformly charged biomolecules tend to
partition towards the internal core of an oppositely-charged hydrogel.
Hydrophobic attraction shifts the states towards internal sorption of the
biomolecule, whereas steric repulsion promotes surface adsorption for
oppositely-charged biomolecules, or the total exclusion for likely-charged
ones. Our results establish a guidance for the spatial partitioning of proteins
and drugs in hydrogel carriers, tuneable by hydrogel charge, pH and salt

Optimal Control for nonlinear systems is computationally intractable because of
the need to solve a Finite Horizon Stochastic Optimal Control Problem. However,
solving this problem leads to an optimal probing nature of the resulting
control law, called dual control, which trades off benefits of exploration and
exploitation. In practice, intractability of Stochastic Model Predictive
Control is typically overcome by replacement of the underlying Stochastic
Optimal Control problem by more amenable approximate surrogate problems, which
however come at a loss of the optimal probing nature of the control signals.
While probing can be superimposed in some approaches, this is done
sub-optimally. In this paper, we examine approximation of the system dynamics
by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with its own Finite Horizon
Stochastic Optimal Control Problem, which can be solved for an optimal control
policy, implemented in receding horizon fashion. This procedure enables
maintaining probing in the control actions. We further discuss a numerical

The Cepheid belongs to the peculiar W Vir group, for which the evolutionary
status is virtually unknown. It is the first single-lined system with a
pulsating component analyzed using the method developed by Pilecki et al.
(2013). We show that the presence of a pulsator makes it possible to derive
accurate physical parameters of the stars even if radial velocities can be
measured for only one of the components. We have used four different methods to
limit and estimate the physical parameters, eventually obtaining precise
results by combining pulsation theory with the spectroscopic and photometric
solutions. The Cepheid radius, mass and temperature are $25.3 \pm 0.2 R_\odot$,
$1.51 \pm 0.09 M_\odot$ and $5300 \pm 100 K$, respectively, while its companion
has similar size ($26.3 R_\odot$), but is more massive ($6.8 M_\odot$) and
hotter ($9500 K$). Our best estimate for the p-factor of the Cepheid is $1.30
\pm 0.03$. The mass, position on the period-luminosity diagram, and pulsation
amplitude indicate that the pulsating component is very similar to the
Anomalous Cepheids, although it has a much longer period and is redder in
color. The very unusual combination of the components suggest that the system
has passed through a mass transfer phase in its evolution. More complicated
internal structure would then explain its peculiarity.

computation fault-tolerantly. However, no quantum error-correcting code (QECC)
can transversally implement a quantum universal gate set (Eastin and Knill,
Phys. Rev. Lett., 102, 110502). Since reversible classical computation is often
a dominating part of useful quantum computation, whether or not it can be
implemented transversally is an important open problem. We show that, other
than a small set of non-additive codes that we cannot rule out, no binary QECC
can transversally implement a classical reversible universal gate set. In
particular, no such QECC can implement the Toffoli gate transversally.
  We prove our result by constructing an information theoretically secure (but
inefficient) quantum homomorphic encryption (ITS-QHE) scheme inspired by Ouyang
et al. (arXiv:1508.00938). Homomorphic encryption allows the implementation of
certain functions directly on encrypted data, i.e. homomorphically. Our scheme
builds on almost any QECC, and implements that code's transversal gate set
homomorphically. We observe a restriction imposed by Nayak's bound (FOCS 1999)
on ITS-QHE, implying that any ITS quantum fully homomorphic scheme (ITS-QFHE)
implementing the full set of classical reversible functions must be highly
inefficient. While our scheme incurs exponential overhead, any such QECC
implementing Toffoli transversally would still violate this lower bound through

the classical exactly solvable models in the KPZ universality class. We study
the ""slow bond"" model, where TASEP on $\mathbb{Z}$ is imputed with a slow bond
at the origin. The slow bond increases the particle density immediately to its
left and decreases the particle density immediately to its right. Whether or
not this effect is detectable in the macroscopic current started from the step
initial condition has attracted much interest over the years and this question
was settled recently (Basu, Sidoravicius, Sly (2014)) by showing that the
current is reduced even for arbitrarily small strength of the defect. Following
non-rigorous physics arguments (Janowsky, Lebowitz (1992, 1994)) and some
unpublished works by Bramson, a conjectural description of properties of
invariant measures of TASEP with a slow bond at the origin was provided in
Liggett's 1999 book. We establish Liggett's conjectures and in particular show
that TASEP with a slow bond at the origin, started from step initial condition,
converges in law to an invariant measure that is asymptotically close to
product measures with different densities far away from the origin towards left
and right. Our proof exploits the correspondence between TASEP and the last
passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with exponential weights and uses the
understanding of geometry of maximal paths in those models.

shown to drastically enhance its ionic conductivity. Therefore, binary mixtures
seem to be a promising way to tune the conductivity of such solid-state

transport in plastic crystals and the influence of mixing, a much broader data

ionic and dipolar dynamics of this system. All mixtures reveal
plastic-crystalline phases with corresponding orientational glass-transitions.
Moreover, their conductivity seems to be dominated by the ""revolving-door""
mechanism, implying a close coupling between the ionic translational and the
molecular reorientational dynamics of the surrounding plastic-crystalline
matrix. In contrast to succinonitrile-based mixtures, there is no strong
variation of this coupling with the mixing ratio.

drag and diffusion coefficients of a particle in Brownian motion. In this

The step-sizes depend on local objective functions, and they can be as large as
those of the gradient descent. Secondly, for the special case without
non-smooth terms, linear convergence can be achieved under the strong convexity
assumption. The dependence of the convergence rate on the objective functions
and the network are separated, and the convergence rate of the new algorithm is
as good as one of the two convergence rates that match the typical rates for
the general gradient descent and the consensus averaging. We provide numerical

We prove that there exists a quadratic extension $K$ of $k$ such that $G$ is

$G(F)/R$ denotes the group of $R$-equivalence classes in $G(F)$, in the sense

retract $K$-rational and that the Kneser-Tits conjecture holds for these groups
over $K$. Moreover, $G(L)$ is projectively simple as an abstract group for any

important nuclear target for current and future experiments. Liquid argon time
projection chambers (LArTPCs) possess various advantages in measuring
electroweak neutrino-nucleus cross sections. Concurrent theoretical research is
an evident necessity. Purpose: 40Ar is larger than 12C, and one expects nuclear
effects to play a bigger role in reactions. We present inclusive differential
and total cross section results for charged-current neutrino scattering on 40Ar
and perform a comparison with 12C, 16O and 56Fe targets, to find out about the
A-dependent behavior of model predictions. Method: Our model starts off with a
Hartree-Fock description of the nucleus, with the nucleons interacting through
a mean field generated by an effective Skyrme force. Long-range correlations
are introduced by means of a continuum random phase approximation (CRPA)
approach. Further methods to improve the accuracy of model predictions are also
incorporated in the calculations. Results: We present calculations for 12C,
16O, 40Ar and 56Fe, showcasing differential cross sections over a broad range

results for 40Ar and we discuss the differences between nuclear responses.
Conclusions: At low incoming energies and forward scattering we identify an
enhancement in the 40Ar cross section compared to 12C, as well as in the high
$\omega$ (low $T_\mu$ ) region across the entire studied $E_\nu$ range. The
contribution to the folded cross section of the reaction strength at values of

associated helium enrichment is expected to affect the evolution of stars, in
general, and of low-mass stars, and in particular the progenitors of white
dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the effects of different initial helium
contents on the properties of white dwarfs such as their masses, compositions,
and the time since their formation. Results. In a globular cluster at a given
age, the He enrichment implies lower initial masses for stars at a given phase.
Thus it leads to a decrease of the masses of white dwarfs reaching the cooling
sequence. In addition the He enrichment increases the total mass and number of
white dwarfs and eventually allows the presence of He white dwarf from single
progenitors. Conclusions. The low He enrichment determined in most globular
clusters with different methods results in negligible effects on the white
dwarf properties. However, in the few globular clusters that display a high He
enrichment, this may significantly affect the characteristics of the white
dwarfs. In NGC 2808 and {\omega} Centauri the high He enrichment even leads to
the formation of He white dwarfs from single He-rich progenitors. Therefore
investigating the white dwarf mass domain in globular clusters with a high He
enrichment would provide an additional indirect way to measure and constrain
the He enrichment degree.

is the rarity of planet pairs in low-order mean-motion resonances. We revisit
the physics of resonance capture via convergent disk-driven migration. We point
out that for planet spacings typical of stable configurations for Kepler
systems, the planets can routinely maintain a small but nonzero eccentricity
due to gravitational perturbations from their neighbors. Together with the
upper limit on the migration rate needed for capture, the finite eccentricity
can make resonance capture difficult or impossible in Sun-like systems for
planets smaller than ~Neptune-sized. This mass limit on efficient capture is
broadly consistent with observed exoplanet pairs that have mass determinations:
of pairs with the heavier planet exterior to the lighter planet -- which would
have been undergoing convergent migration in their disks -- those in or nearly
in resonance are much more likely to have total mass greater than two Neptune
masses than to have smaller masses. The agreement suggests that the observed
paucity of resonant pairs around sun-like stars may simply arise from a small
resonance capture probability for lower-mass planets. Planet pairs that thereby
avoid resonance capture are much less likely to collide in an eventual close
approach than to simply migrate past one another to become a divergently
migrating pair with the lighter planet exterior. For systems around M stars we
expect resonant pairs to be much more common, since there the minimum mass
threshhold for efficient capture is about an Earth mass.

frontier for dark matter (DM) research. Scenarios with small DM particle
masses, large momenta or hidden interactions tend to suppress the gravitational
clustering at small scales. The details of this suppression depend on the DM
particle nature, allowing for a direct link between DM models and astrophysical
observations. However, most of the astrophysical constraints obtained so far
refer to a very specific shape of the power suppression, corresponding to
thermal warm dark matter (WDM), i.e., candidates with a Fermi-Dirac or
Bose-Einstein momentum distribution. In this work we introduce a new analytical
fitting formula for the power spectrum, which is simple yet flexible enough to
reproduce the clustering signal of large classes of non-thermal DM models,
which are not at all adequately described by the oversimplified notion of WDM.
We show that the formula is able to fully cover the parameter space of sterile
neutrinos (whether resonantly produced or from particle decay), mixed cold and
warm models, fuzzy dark matter, as well as other models suggested by effective
theory of structure formation (ETHOS). Based on this fitting formula, we
perform a large suite of N-body simulations and we extract important nonlinear
statistics, such as the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function.
Finally, we present first preliminary astrophysical constraints, based on
linear theory, from both the number of Milky Way satellites and the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. This paper is a first step towards a general and
comprehensive modeling of small-scale departures from the standard cold DM

transverse field Ising ferromagnet. In contrast to classical critical systems,
whose properties depend only on symmetry and the dimension of space, the nature
of a quantum phase transition also depends on the dynamics. In the transverse
field Ising model, the order parameter is not conserved and increasing the
transverse field enhances quantum fluctuations until they become strong enough
to restore the symmetry of the ground state. Ising pseudo-spins can represent
the order parameter of any system with a two-fold degenerate broken-symmetry
phase, including electronic nematic order associated with spontaneous
point-group symmetry breaking. Here, we show for the representative example of
orbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet that an orthogonal strain or
a perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of the transverse field, thereby
providing a practical route for tuning appropriate materials to a quantum
critical point. While the transverse fields are conjugate to seemingly
unrelated order parameters, their non-trivial commutation relations with the
nematic order parameter, which can be represented by a Berry-phase term in an
effective field theory, intrinsically intertwines the different order
parameters.

velocity dispersion function (VDF), we construct a velocity dispersion complete
sample of quiescent galaxies with Dn4000$ > 1.5$. The sample consists of
galaxies with central velocity dispersion larger than the velocity dispersion
completeness limit of the SDSS survey. Our VDF measurement is consistent with
previous field VDFs for $\sigma > 200$ km s$^{-1}$. In contrast with previous
results, the VDF does not decline significantly for $\sigma < 200$ km s$^{-1}$.
The field and the similarly constructed cluster VDFs are remarkably flat at low
velocity dispersion ($\sigma < 250$ km s$^{-1}$). The cluster VDF exceeds the
field for $\sigma > 250$ km s$^{-1}$ providing a measure of the relatively
larger number of massive subhalos in clusters. The VDF is a probe of the dark
matter halo distribution because the measured central velocity dispersion may
be directly proportional to the dark matter velocity dispersion. Thus the VDF
provides a potentially powerful test of simulations for models of structure
formation.

galaxy clusters has opened a new window into the process of galaxy formation
and evolution. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the formation
history of UDGs, and their ability to survive in the harsh cluster
environments. A key requirement to distinguish between these scenarios is a
measurement of their halo masses which, due to their low surface brightnesses,
has proven difficult if one relies on stellar tracers of the potential. We
exploit weak gravitational lensing, a technique that does not depend on these
baryonic tracers, to measure the average subhalo mass of 784 UDGs selected in
18 clusters at $z\leq0.09$. Our sample of UDGs has a median stellar mass
$\langle m_\star\rangle=2\times10^8\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a median effective
radius $\langle r_\mathrm{eff}\rangle=2.8$ kpc. We constrain the average mass
of subhaloes within 30 kpc to $\log
m_\mathrm{UDG}(r<30\,\mathrm{kpc})/\mathrm{M}_\odot\leq10.99$ at 95 per cent
credibility, implying an effective virial mass $\log
m_{200}/\mathrm{M}_\odot\leq11.80$, and a lower limit on the stellar mass
fraction within 10 kpc of 1.0 per cent. Such mass is consistent with a simple
extrapolation of the subhalo-to-stellar mass relation of typical satellite
galaxies in massive clusters. However, our analysis is not sensitive to scatter
about this mean mass; the possibility remains that extreme UDGs reside in
haloes as massive as the Milky Way.

precision matrix include the widely used ICAR model, which is singular, and its
nonsingular extension which lacks interpretability. We propose a new parametric
model for the precision matrix based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
representation of the spatial dependence. Our model guarantees positive
definiteness and, hence, in addition to being a valid prior for regional
spatially correlated random effects, can also directly model the outcome from
dependent data like images and networks. Theoretical results establish a link
between the parameters in our model and the variance and covariances of the
random effects. Substantive simulation studies demonstrate that the improved
interpretability of our model reaps benefits in terms of accurately recovering
the latent spatial random effects as well as for inference on the spatial
covariance parameters. Under modest spatial correlation, our model far
outperforms the CAR models, while the performances are similar when the spatial
correlation is strong. We also assess sensitivity to the choice of the ordering
in the DAG construction using theoretical and empirical results which testify
to the robustness of our model. We also present a large-scale public health
application demonstrating the competitive performance of the model.

introduced by Pawar and Ramchandran, we show that all such matches can be
determined with high probability in sub-linear time. Specifically, if the query
length $M = O(N^\mu)$ and the number of matches $L=O(N^\lambda)$, we show that
for $\lambda < 1-\mu$ all the matching positions can be determined with a
probability that approaches 1 as $N \rightarrow \infty$ for $K \leq
\frac{1}{6}M$. More importantly our scheme has a worst-case computational
complexity that is only $O\left(\max\{N^{1-\mu}\log^2 N, N^{\mu+\lambda}\log N

the best known computational complexity of $O\left(N^{1-0.359 \mu} \right)$ for
recovering one matching position by Andoni {\em et al.} \cite{andoni2013shift}.
Further, the number of Fourier transform coefficients that need to be computed,

be characterized by the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Level 3/2 is recognized
by poNFAs, level 1 by confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs as well as by
confluent poDFAs, and level 1/2 by saturated poNFAs. We study the universality
problem for confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs. It asks whether an
automaton accepts all words over its alphabet. Universality for both NFAs and
poNFAs is a PSpace-complete problem. For confluent, self-loop deterministic
poNFAs, the complexity drops to coNP-complete if the alphabet is fixed but is
open if the alphabet may grow. We solve this problem by showing that it is
PSpace-complete if the alphabet may grow polynomially. Consequently, our result
provides a lower-bound complexity for some other problems, including inclusion,
equivalence, and $k$-piecewise testability. Since universality for saturated
poNFAs is easy, confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs are the simplest and
natural kind of NFAs characterizing a well-known class of languages, for which
deciding universality is as difficult as for general NFAs.

deciding the type of commensurate magnetic order stabilized within the
itinerant scenario of iron-pnictides. Recent experimental findings in the
tetragonal magnetic phase attest to the existence of the so-called charge and
spin ordered density wave over the spin-vortex crystal phase, the latter of
which tends to be favored in simplified band models of itinerant magnetism.
Here we show that employing a multiorbital itinerant Landau approach based on
realistic bandstructures can account for the experimentally observed magnetic
phase, and thus shed light on the importance of the orbital content in deciding
the magnetic order. In addition, we remark that the presence of a hole pocket
centered at the Brillouin zone's ${\rm M}$-point favors a magnetic stripe
rather than a tetragonal magnetic phase. For inferring the symmetry properties
of the different magnetic phases, we formulate our theory in terms of magnetic
order parameters transforming according to irreducible representations of the
ensuing D$_{\rm 4h}$ point group. The latter method not only provides
transparent understanding of the symmetry breaking schemes but also reveals
that the leading instabilities always belong to the $\{A_{1g},B_{1g}\}$ subset
of irreducible representations, independent of their C$_2$ or C$_4$ nature.

many questions pertaining to black hole (BH) growth and coevolution of massive
BHs and their host galaxies. To answer them it is critical to quantify how the
ionizing radiation that emanates from the innermost regions of the BH accretion
flow couples to the surrounding medium and how it regulates the BH fueling. In
this work we use high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations with the code Enzo, equipped with adaptive ray tracing module
Moray, to investigate radiation-regulated BH accretion of cold gas. Our
simulations reproduce findings from an earlier generation of 1D/2D simulations:
the accretion powered UV and X-ray radiation forms a highly ionized bubble,
which leads to suppression of BH accretion rate characterized by quasi-periodic
outbursts. A new feature revealed by the 3D simulations is the highly turbulent
nature of the gas flow in vicinity of the ionization front. During quiescent
periods between accretion outbursts, the ionized bubble shrinks in size and the
gas density that precedes the ionization front increases. Consequently, the 3D
simulations show oscillations in the accretion rate of only ~2-3 orders of
magnitude, significantly smaller than 1D/2D models. We calculate the energy
budget of the gas flow and find that turbulence is the main contributor to the
kinetic energy of the gas but corresponds to less than 10% of its thermal
energy and thus does not contribute significantly to the pressure support of
the gas.

epidemiological data, a complete characterization of the spatiotemporal spread
of Ebola cases remains a challenge. In this work, we offer a novel perspective
on the EBOV epidemic that utilizes virus genome sequences to inform
population-level, spatial models. Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages, these
dynamic spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV
in Sierra Leone. Further, we developed a model selection framework that
identifies important epidemiological variables influencing the spatiotemporal
propagation of EBOV. Consistent with other investigations, our results show
that the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the
epidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our
analysis also revealed a substantial decline in the dependence on population
size at the end of the epidemic, coinciding with the large-scale intervention
campaign: Operation Western Area Surge. More generally, we believe this
framework, pairing molecular diagnostics with dynamic models, has the potential
to be a powerful forecasting tool along with offering operationally-relevant
guidance for surveillance and sampling strategies during an epidemic.

system integrating plasmonic gold nanorods acting as nanoantennas with an
on-resonance dielectric photonic crystal (PC) slab acting as a low-loss
microcavity and, more importantly, by synergistically combining their
advantages to produce a much stronger local field enhancement than that of the

of nanophotonic resonant elements, we show that it is crucial to coordinate
both the dissipative loss of the nanoantenna and the Q-factor of the low-loss

Fabry-Perot resonator, which has proved successful for resonant amplification
of the antenna's local field intensity, we theoretically and experimentally
show that coupling to a modest-Q PC guided resonance can produce a greater
amplification by at least an order of magnitude. The synergistic
nanoantenna-microcavity hybrid strategy opens new opportunities for further
enhancing nanoscale light-matter interactions to benefit numerous areas such as

to give a formal semantics to a given distributed computing model, to capture
precisely the knowledge needed to solve a distributed task, such as consensus.
Furthermore, by moving to a dual model of epistemic logic defined by simplicial
complexes, topological invariants are exposed, which determine task
solvability. In this paper we show how to extend the setting above to include
in the knowledge of the processes, knowledge about the model of computation
itself. The extension describes the knowledge processes gain about the current
execution, in problems where processes have no input values at all.

$\mathcal{M}$(BH$_4$)$_x$ has been shown to lower their decomposition
temperatures with $\mathcal{M}$ of low electronegativity ($\chi_p \lesssim
1.6$), but raise it for high-$\chi_p$ MBs ($\chi_p \gtrsim 1.6$). Although this
behavior is just as desired, an understanding of the mechanisms that cause it
is still lacking. Using \emph{ab initio} methods, we elucidate those mechanisms
and find that ammoniation always causes thermodynamic destabilization,
explaining the observed lower decomposition temperatures for low-$\chi_p$ MBs.
For high-$\chi_p$ MBs, we find that ammoniation blocks B$_2$H$_6$
formation---the preferred decomposition mechanism in these MBs---and thus
kinetically stabilizes those phases. The shift in decomposition pathway that
causes the distinct change from destabilization to stabilization around
$\chi_p=1.6$ thus coincides with the onset of B$_2$H$_6$ formation in MBs.
Furthermore, with our analysis we are also able to explain why these materials
release either H$_2$ or NH$_3$ gas upon decomposition. We find that NH$_3$ is
much more strongly coordinated with higher-$\chi_p$ metals and direct H$_2$
formation/release becomes more favorable in these materials. Our findings are
of importance for unraveling the hydrogen release mechanisms in an important
new and promising class of hydrogen storage materials, allowing for a guided
tuning of their chemistry to further improve their properties.

for distributed stochastic convex learning from high-rate data streams. The
setup involves a network of nodes---each one of which has a stream of data
arriving at a constant rate---that solve a stochastic convex optimization
problem by collaborating with each other over rate-limited communication links.
To this end, we present and analyze two algorithms---termed distributed
stochastic approximation mirror descent (D-SAMD) and accelerated distributed
stochastic approximation mirror descent (AD-SAMD)---that are based on two
stochastic variants of mirror descent and in which nodes collaborate via
approximate averaging of the local, noisy subgradients using distributed
consensus. Our main contributions are (i) bounds on the convergence rates of
D-SAMD and AD-SAMD in terms of the number of nodes, network topology, and ratio
of the data streaming and communication rates, and (ii) sufficient conditions
for order-optimum convergence of these algorithms. In particular, we show that
for sufficiently well-connected networks, distributed learning schemes can
obtain order-optimum convergence even if the communications rate is small.
Further we find that the use of accelerated methods significantly enlarges the
regime in which order-optimum convergence is achieved; this is in contrast to
the centralized setting, where accelerated methods usually offer only a modest
improvement. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms using numerical experiments.

The velocity dispersions were calculated using redshifts determined from
spectra obtained at Gemini observatory with the GMOS multi-object spectrograph.
We correct our estimates for effects due to finite aperture, Eddington bias and
correlated scatter between velocity dispersion and the Planck mass proxy. The
result for the mass bias parameter, $(1-b)$, depends on the value of the galaxy
velocity bias $b_v$ adopted from simulations: $(1-b)=(0.51\pm0.09) b_v^3$.
Using a velocity bias of $b_v=1.08$ from Munari et al., we obtain
$(1-b)=0.64\pm 0.11$, i.e, an error of 17% on the mass bias measurement with 17
clusters. This mass bias value is consistent with most previous weak lensing
determinations. It lies within $1\sigma$ of the value needed to reconcile the
Planck cluster counts with the Planck primary CMB constraints. We emphasize
that uncertainty in the velocity bias severely hampers precision measurements
of the mass bias using velocity dispersions. On the other hand, when we fix the
Planck mass bias using the constraints from Penna-Lima et al., based on weak
lensing measurements, we obtain a positive velocity bias $b_v \gtrsim 0.9$ at
$3\sigma$.

independently rotating cylinders, is numerically studied by instantaneously
stopping the forcing from an initially statistically stationary flow field at a
Reynolds number of $Re=3.5\times 10^4$. The effect of wall-friction is analysed
by comparing three separate cases, in which the cylinders are either suddenly
made no-slip or stress-free. Different life stages are observed during the
decay. In the first stage, the decay is dominated by large-scale rolls.
Counterintuitively, when these rolls fade away, if the flow inertia is small a
redistribution of energy occurs, the energy of the azimuthal velocity behaves
non-monotonically: first decreasing by almost two orders of magnitude, and then
increasing during the redistribution. The second stage is dominated by
non-normal transient growth of perturbations in the axial (spanwise) direction.
Once this mechanism is exhausted, the flow enters the final life stage, viscous
decay, which is dominated by wall-friction. We show that this stage can be
modeled by a one-dimensional heat equation, and that self-similar velocity
profiles collapse onto the theoretical solution.

If such a composite serves as a soft actuator, forces are imposed on or induced
between the embedded particles. We investigate how the presence of the rigid
wall affects the interactions between the inclusions in the elastic matrix. For
no-slip boundary conditions, we transfer Blake's derivation of a corresponding
Green's function from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics to the linearly elastic
case. Results for no-slip and free-slip surface conditions are compared to each
other and to the bulk behavior. Our results suggest that walls with free-slip
surface conditions are preferred when they serve as substrates for soft
actuators made from elastic composite materials. As we further demonstrate, the
presence of a rigid wall can qualitatively change the interactions between the
inclusions. In effect, it can switch attractive interactions into repulsive
ones (and vice versa). It should be straightforward to observe the effects in
future experiments and to combine our results, e.g., with the modeling of
biological cells and tissue on rigid surfaces.

  Prefetching","23 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to characterize the fundamental limit of the tradeoff between the
amount of cache memory and the delivery transmission rate of multiuser caching
systems, various coding schemes have been proposed in the literature. These
schemes can largely be categorized into two classes, namely uncoded prefetching
schemes and coded prefetching schemes. While uncoded prefetching schemes in
general offer order-wise optimal performance, coded prefetching schemes often
have better performance at the low cache memory regime. The significant
differences in the coding components between the two classes may leave the
impression that they are largely unrelated. In this work, we provide a
connection between the uncoded prefetching scheme proposed by Maddah Ali and
Niesen (and its improved version by Yu et al) and the coded prefetching scheme
proposed by Tian and Chen. A critical observation is first given where a coding
component in the Tian-Chen scheme can be replaced by a binary .code, which
enables us to view the two schemes as the extremes of a more general scheme. An
explicit example is given to show that the intermediate operating points of
this general scheme can in fact provide new memory-rate tradeoff points
previously not known to be achievable in the literature. This new general
coding scheme is then presented and analyzed rigorously, which yields a new
inner bound to the memory-rate tradeoff for the caching problem.

risk prediction of adverse events for non-ICU patients using ~200 variables
(vitals, lab results, assessments, ...). There are several missing predictor
values for most patients, which in the health sciences is the norm, rather than
the exception. A Bayesian approach is presented that addresses many of the
shortcomings to standard approaches to missing predictors: (i) treatment of the
uncertainty due to imputation is straight-forward in the Bayesian paradigm,
(ii) the predictor distribution is flexibly modeled as an infinite normal
mixture with latent variables to explicitly account for discrete predictors
(i.e., as in multivariate probit regression models), and (iii) certain missing
not at random situations can be handled effectively by allowing the indicator
of missingness into the predictor distribution only to inform the distribution
of the missing variables. The proposed approach also has the benefit of
providing a distribution for the prediction, including the uncertainty inherent
in the imputation. Therefore, we can ask questions such as: is it possible this
individual is at high risk but we are missing too much information to know for
sure? How much would we reduce the uncertainty in our risk prediction by
obtaining a particular missing value? This approach is applied to the BPR
problem resulting in excellent predictive capability to identify deteriorating
patients.

author used the method of containers to prove that, if $G$ is simple and
$d$-regular, then $\chi_l(G)\ge (1/(r-1)+o(1))\log_r d$.
  To see how close this inequality is to best possible, we examine $\chi_l(G)$
when $G$ is a random $r$-partite hypergraph with $n$ vertices in each class.
The value when $r=2$ was determined by Alon and Krivelevich, here we show that
$\chi_l(G)= (g(r,\alpha)+o(1))\log_r d$ almost surely, where $d$ is the
expected average degree of~$G$ and $\alpha=\log_nd$.
  The function $g(r,\alpha)$ is defined in terms of ""preference orders"" and can
be determined fairly explicitly. This is enough to show that the container
method gives an optimal lower bound on $\chi_l(G)$ for $r=2$ and $r=3$, but,
perhaps surprisingly, apparently not for $r\ge4$.

local Seebeck coefficient depending on the width of the nanowire. In the
nanowires with nanogaps, where charge transport is by tunneling, we observe
large photovoltages up to tens of mV, with magnitude, polarization dependence,
and spatial localization that follow the plasmon resonance in the nanogap. This
is consistent with a model of photocurrent across the nanogap carried by the

created a neural-network-based system, known as PilotNet, which outputs
steering angles given images of the road ahead. PilotNet is trained using road
images paired with the steering angles generated by a human driving a
data-collection car. It derives the necessary domain knowledge by observing
human drivers. This eliminates the need for human engineers to anticipate what
is important in an image and foresee all the necessary rules for safe driving.
Road tests demonstrated that PilotNet can successfully perform lane keeping in
a wide variety of driving conditions, regardless of whether lane markings are
present or not.
  The goal of the work described here is to explain what PilotNet learns and
how it makes its decisions. To this end we developed a method for determining
which elements in the road image most influence PilotNet's steering decision.
Results show that PilotNet indeed learns to recognize relevant objects on the
road.
  In addition to learning the obvious features such as lane markings, edges of
roads, and other cars, PilotNet learns more subtle features that would be hard
to anticipate and program by engineers, for example, bushes lining the edge of
the road and atypical vehicle classes.

comprising multivariate Hermite orthogonal polynomials in dependent Gaussian
random variables. The second-moment properties of Hermite polynomials reveal a
weakly orthogonal system when obtained for a general Gaussian probability
measure. Still, the exponential integrability of norm allows the Hermite
polynomials to constitute a complete set and hence a basis in a Hilbert space.
The completeness is vitally important for the convergence of the generalized
PCE to the correct limit. The optimality of the generalized PCE and the
approximation quality due to truncation are discussed. New analytical formulae
are proposed to calculate the mean and variance of a generalized PCE
approximation of a general output variable in terms of the expansion
coefficients and statistical properties of Hermite polynomials. However, unlike
in the classical PCE, calculating the coefficients of the generalized PCE
requires solving a coupled system of linear equations. Besides, the variance
formula of the generalized PCE contains additional terms due to statistical
dependence among Gaussian variables. The additional terms vanish when the
Gaussian variables are statistically independent, reverting the generalized PCE
to the classical PCE. Numerical examples illustrate the generalized PCE
approximation in estimating the statistical properties of various output
variables.

whether WL 17 is actually a Class II disk being extincted by foreground

dense material close to the source such as a remnant envelope. Self-consistent

reproduce both the ALMA 3 mm observations and the broadband SED of WL 17. This
suggests that WL 17 is a disk in the early stages of its formation, and yet
even at this young age the inner disk has been depleted. Although there are
multiple pathways for such a hole to be created in a disk, if this hole were

correlation has been claimed to show a linear relation between the acceleration
and the maximum velocity of a jet. This linear relationship has been used to
help model the mechanisms responsible for the jets. However it is proposed here
that the relation between velocity and acceleration is given by the normal
equations of motion for constant acceleration and consequently the relationship
is non-linear. Other correlations are also examined and the implications for
spicule mechanisms are considered.

The new algorithm guards against spurious programs by combining the systematic

sky intersection angles greater than 5 degrees and trail lengths in excess of 2
km also detected by the Middle Atmosphere Alomar Radar System (MAARSY) as head
echoes was performed. These events show a median deviation in radiants between
radar and optical determinations of 1.5 degrees, with 1/3 of events having
radiant agreement to less than one degree. MAARSY tends to record average
speeds roughly 0.5 km/s and 1.3 km higher than optical records, in part due to
the higher sensitivity of MAARSY as compared to the optical instruments. More
than 98% of all head echoes are not detected with the optical system. Using
this non-detection ratio and the known limiting sensitivity of the cameras, we
estimate that the limiting meteoroid detection mass of MAARSY is in the 10-9 kg
to 10-10 kg (astronomical limiting meteor magnitudes of +11 to +12) appropriate
to speeds from 30-60 km/s. There is a clear trend of higher peak RCS for
brighter meteors between 35 and -30 dBsm. For meteors with similar magnitudes,
the MAARSY head echo radar cross-section is larger at higher speeds. Brighter
meteors at fixed heights and similar speeds have consistently, on average,
larger RCS values, in accordance with established scattering theory. However,
our data show RCS ~ v/2, much weaker than the normally assumed RCS ~ v^3, a
consequence of our requiring head echoes to also be detectable optically. Most
events show a smooth variation of RCS with height broadly following the light
production behavior. A significant minority of meteors show large variations in
RCS relative to the optical light curve over common height intervals,
reflecting fragmentation or possibly differential ablation.

observable currents. With the aim of modeling spacetime local physics, we work
on spacetime domains $U\subset M$ which may have boundaries and corners.
Hamiltonian observable currents are those satisfying ${\sf

family of Hamiltonian observable currents is endowed with a bracket that gives
it a structure which generalizes a Lie algebra in which the Jacobi relation is

boundaries the resulting algebra of observables is a Lie algebra. In the

domains, and the local algebras obey interesting gluing properties. These
results are due to considering currents that defined only locally in field
space and to a revision of the concept of gauge invariance in bounded spacetime
domains. A perturbation of the field on a bounded spacetime domain is regarded
as gauge if: (i) the ""first order holographic imprint"" that it leaves in any
hypersurface locally splitting a spacetime domain into two subdomains is
negligible according to the linearized gluing field equation, and (ii) the
perturbation vanishes at the boundary of the domain. A current is gauge
invariant if the variation in them induced by any gauge perturbation vanishes

the technique of molecular replacement, which borrows phases from a previously
solved homologous structure, and appends them to the measured Fourier
magnitudes of the diffraction patterns of the unknown structure. More recently,
molecular replacement has been proposed for solving the missing orthogonal
matrices problem arising in Kam's autocorrelation analysis for single particle
reconstruction using X-ray free electron lasers and cryo-EM. In classical
molecular replacement, it is common to estimate the magnitudes of the unknown
structure as twice the measured magnitudes minus the magnitudes of the
homologous structure, a procedure known as `twicing'. Mathematically, this is
equivalent to finding an unbiased estimator for a complex-valued scalar. We
generalize this scheme for the case of estimating real or complex valued
matrices arising in single particle autocorrelation analysis. We name this
approach ""Anisotropic Twicing"" because unlike the scalar case, the unbiased
estimator is not obtained by a simple magnitude isotropic correction. We
compare the performance of the least squares, twicing and anisotropic twicing
estimators on synthetic and experimental datasets. We demonstrate 3D homology
modeling in cryo-EM directly from experimental data without iterative
refinement or class averaging, for the first time.

control not only is smaller than that for the tilt control, but actually
decreases as a function of an increasing exchange interaction. This is
understood as a combined consequence of the greatly suppressed detuning noise
when the two dots are symmetrically operated, as well as an enhancement of the
inter-dot hopping energy of an electron when the barrier is lowered which in
turn reduces the relative charge noise at large exchange interaction values. We
have also studied the response of the qubit to charged impurities at different

particle exposed to the random force due to dust charge fluctuations are
considered, and the velocity relaxation process of the dust particle is
considered as a non-Markovian stochastic process. Considering memory effects in
the velocity relaxation process of the dust particle yields a retarded friction
force, which is introduced by a memory kernel in the fractional Langevin
equation. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the dust grain is derived
from this equation. The mean-square displacement and the velocity
autocorrelation function of the dust particle are obtained, and their
asymptotic behavior, the dust particle temperature due to charge fluctuations,
and the diffusion coefficient are studied in the long-time limit. As an
interesting feature, it is found that by considering memory effects in the
velocity relaxation process of the dust particle, fluctuating force on the dust
particle can cause an anomalous diffusion in a dusty plasma. In this case, the
mean-square displacement of the dust grain increases slower than linearly with
time, and the velocity autocorrelation function decays as a power-law instead
of the exponential decay. Finally, in the Markov limit, these results are in
good agreement with those obtained from previous works for Markov (memoryless)

their application for cloaking due to anomalous localized resonances. We derive
a very general and novel class of elastic structures that can induce plasmonic

particular case of the general structures constructed in our study.
Furthermore, we consider the plasmonic resonances within the finite frequency
regime, and rigorously verify the quasi-static approximation for diametrically
small plasmonic inclusions. Finally, as an application of the newly found
structures, we construct a plasmonic device of the core-shell-matrix form that
can induce cloaking due to anomalous localized resonance in the quasi-static

Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people agree and disagree about
specific topics (e.g., ""A is completely wrong""). By applying these linguistic

disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous work on item
recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as
matrix factorization: representing users' preferences as a user-topic matrix
and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts
the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our proposed

latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic

  Algorithms","Accepted to The Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence (AAAI-18). Feb 2018, New Orleans",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $L_1$-regularized models are widely used for sparse regression or
classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the orthant-wise passive
descent algorithm (OPDA) for optimizing $L_1$-regularized models, as an
improved substitute of proximal algorithms, which are the standard tools for
optimizing the models nowadays. OPDA uses a stochastic variance-reduced
gradient (SVRG) to initialize the descent direction, then apply a novel
alignment operator to encourage each element keeping the same sign after one
iteration of update, so the parameter remains in the same orthant as before. It
also explicitly suppresses the magnitude of each element to impose sparsity.
The quasi-Newton update can be utilized to incorporate curvature information
and accelerate the speed. We prove a linear convergence rate for OPDA on
general smooth and strongly-convex loss functions. By conducting experiments on
$L_1$-regularized logistic regression and convolutional neural networks, we
show that OPDA outperforms state-of-the-art stochastic proximal algorithms,
implying a wide range of applications in training sparse models.

other spectroscopic surveys, determining radial velocities for 30 and
spectroscopic distances for 5 candidates. In addition, follow-up observations
have been carried out at the Isaac Newton Telescope for 22 stars, for which we
obtained radial velocities and distance estimates. We discover 14 stars with a
total velocity in the Galactic rest frame > 400 km/s, and 5 of these have a
probability $>50\%$ of being unbound from the Milky Way. Tracing back their

calculations of nuclear structure and dynamics. However, its reliance on
phenomenology may compromise its isovector properties and its performance for
exotic nuclear systems.
  Purpose: This work investigates the possibility of removing some
phenomenology from the density functional by drawing on the high-energy
degrees-of-freedom of the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The QMC model has
microscopically derived isovector properties and far fewer adjustable
parameters.
  Method: The parameters of the Skyrme interaction are fixed using the energy
density functional of the QMC model, to give the Skyrme-QMC (SQMC)
parameterisation.
  Results: Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations of the Sn, Pb and $N=126$
chains are reported, in which SQMC performs with an accuracy comparable to
modern phenomenological functionals.
  Conclusions: The isovector terms of the energy density functional are
significant for the binding energies of neutron-rich nuclei. The isovector
dependence of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction must be taken into account for
calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis abundances.

the joint use of multiple techniques including artificial noise (AN)

This RSCS-OFDM-DM scheme provides an extremely low-complexity structures for
the transmitter and desired receiver and makes the secure and precise wireless
transmission realizable in practice. For illegal eavesdroppers, the receive
power of confidential messages is so weak that their receivers cannot intercept
these confidential messages successfully once it is corrupted by AN. In such a
scheme, the design of phase alignment/beamforming vector and AN projection
matrix depend intimately on the desired direction angle and distance. It is
particularly noted that the use of RSCS leads to a significant outcome that the
receive power of confidential messages mainly concentrates on the small
neighboring region around the desired receiver and only small fraction of its
power leaks out to the remaining large broad regions. This concept is called
secure precise transmission. The probability density function of real-time
receive signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is derived. Also, the
average SINR and its tight upper bound are attained. The approximate
closed-form expression for average secrecy rate is derived by analyzing the
first-null positions of SINR and clarifying the wiretap region.

with the help of an extremal indefinite weight linear eigenvalue problem. The

rests upon the presence of nonlinear functions of the weight both in the

necessary optimality conditions, we completely solve this optimization problem
in the unidimensional case by showing first that every minimizer is unimodal

problem. This allows to show in particular that every minimizer is (up to
additive constants) the characteristic function of three possible domains: an
interval that sticks on the boundary of the box, an interval that is
symmetrically located at the middle of the box, or, for a precise value of the

Collisions can convert ordered energy into heat by means of irreversible
relaxation towards the thermal equilibrium. Recently, Pezzi et al. (Phys. Rev.
Lett., vol. 116, 2016, p. 145001) showed that the plasma collisionality is
enhanced by the presence of fine structures in velocity space. Here, the
analysis is extended by directly comparing the effects of the fully nonlinear

towards the equilibrium of an out of equilibrium distribution function in a
homogeneous force-free plasma, here it is pointed out that it is significant to
retain nonlinearities in the collisional operator to quantify the importance of
collisional effects. Although the presence of several characteristic times
associated with the dissipation of different phase space structures is
recovered in both the cases of the nonlinear and the linearized operators, the
influence of these times is different in the two cases. In the linearized
operator case, the recovered characteristic times are systematically larger
than in the fully nonlinear operator case, this suggesting that fine velocity
structures are dissipated slower if nonlinearities are neglected in the
collisional operator.

causes poor thermal stability of the skyrmion toward collapse at the boundary,

ranking algorithms (such as the popular Google's PageRank) are static in nature
and, as a consequence, they exhibit important shortcomings when applied to real
networks that rapidly evolve in time. The recent advances in the understanding
and modeling of evolving networks have enabled the development of a wide and
diverse range of ranking algorithms that take the temporal dimension into
account. The aim of this review is to survey the existing ranking algorithms,
both static and time-aware, and their applications to evolving networks. We
emphasize both the impact of network evolution on well-established static
algorithms and the benefits from including the temporal dimension for tasks
such as prediction of real network traffic, prediction of future links, and
identification of highly-significant nodes.

  Visual Lip-Reading Feasibility Database","IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture
  Recognition",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speech is the most used communication method between humans and it involves
the perception of auditory and visual channels. Automatic speech recognition
focuses on interpreting the audio signals, although the video can provide
information that is complementary to the audio. Exploiting the visual
information, however, has proven challenging. On one hand, researchers have
reported that the mapping between phonemes and visemes (visual units) is
one-to-many because there are phonemes which are visually similar and
indistinguishable between them. On the other hand, it is known that some people
are very good lip-readers (e.g: deaf people). We study the limit of visual only
speech recognition in controlled conditions. With this goal, we designed a new
database in which the speakers are aware of being read and aim to facilitate
lip-reading. In the literature, there are discrepancies on whether
hearing-impaired people are better lip-readers than normal-hearing people.
Then, we analyze if there are differences between the lip-reading abilities of
9 hearing-impaired and 15 normal-hearing people. Finally, human abilities are
compared with the performance of a visual automatic speech recognition system.
In our tests, hearing-impaired participants outperformed the normal-hearing
participants but without reaching statistical significance. Human observers
were able to decode 44% of the spoken message. In contrast, the visual only
automatic system achieved 20% of word recognition rate. However, if we repeat
the comparison in terms of phonemes both obtained very similar recognition
rates, just above 50%. This suggests that the gap between human lip-reading and
automatic speech-reading might be more related to the use of context than to
the ability to interpret mouth appearance.

understanding of the universe. Accordingly, many experimental searches are
devoted to uncovering its nature. However, both the existing direct detection
methods, and the prominent $\gamma$-ray search with the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (Fermi-LAT), are most sensitive to DM particles with masses below 1
TeV, and are significantly less sensitive to the hard spectra produced in
annihilation via heavy leptons. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) has
had some success in improving on the Fermi-LAT search for higher mass DM
particles, particularly annihilating via heavy lepton states. However, the
recent discovery of high J-factor dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) opens up the possibility of investing more HESS observation time
in the search for DM $\gamma$-ray signatures in dwarf galaxies. This work
explores the potential of HESS to extend its current limits using these new
targets, as well as the future constraints derivable with the up-coming
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). These limits are further compared with those
we derived at low radio frequencies for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
Finally, we explore the impact of HESS, CTA, and Fermi-LAT on the phenomenology
of the ""Madala"" boson hypothesized based on anomalies in the data from the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) run 1. The power of these limits from differing
frequency bands is suggestive of a highly effective multi-frequency DM hunt
strategy making use of both existing and up-coming Southern African telescopes.

  using gradient vector flow",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some lung diseases are related to bronchial airway structures and morphology.
Although airway segmentation from chest CT volumes is an important task in the
computer-aided diagnosis and surgery assistance systems for the chest, complete
3-D airway structure segmentation is a quite challenging task due to its
complex tree-like structure. In this paper, we propose a new airway
segmentation method from 3D chest CT volumes based on volume of interests (VOI)
using gradient vector flow (GVF). This method segments the bronchial regions by
applying the cavity enhancement filter (CEF) to trace the bronchial tree
structure from the trachea. It uses the CEF in the VOI to segment each branch.
And a tube-likeness function based on GVF and the GVF magnitude map in each VOI
are utilized to assist predicting the positions and directions of child
branches. By calculating the tube-likeness function based on GVF and the GVF
magnitude map, the airway-like candidate structures are identified and their
centrelines are extracted. Based on the extracted centrelines, we can detect
the branch points of the bifurcations and directions of the airway branches in
the next level. At the same time, a leakage detection is performed to avoid the
leakage by analysing the pixel information and the shape information of airway
candidate regions extracted in the VOI. Finally, we unify all of the extracted
bronchial regions to form an integrated airway tree. Preliminary experiments
using four cases of chest CT volumes demonstrated that the proposed method can
extract more bronchial branches in comparison with other methods.

within Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data (particularly in the transverse
momentum of the Higgs boson), is interesting for more than just a statistical
hint at unknown and unpredicted physics. This is because the model itself
contains additional new particles that may serve as Dark Matter (DM)
candidates. These particles interact with the Standard Model via a scalar
mediator boson $S$. More interesting still, the conjectured mass range for the
DM candidate ($65$ - $100$ GeV) lies within the region of models viable to try
explain the recent Galactic Centre (GC) gamma-ray excess seen by Fermi Large
Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS).
Therefore, assuming $S$ decays promptly, it should be possible to check what
constraints are imposed upon the effective DM annihilation cross-section in the
Madala scenario by hunting signatures of $S$ decay that follows DM annihilation
within dense astrophysical structures. In order to make use of existing data,
we use the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy and the galactic centre gamma-ray excess
data sets from Fermi-LAT, and compare these to the consequences of various
decay paths for $S$ in the aforementioned environments. We find that, based on
this existing data, we can limit $\tau$ lepton, quark, direct gamma-ray, and
weak boson channels to levels below the canonical relic cross-section. This
allows us to set new limits on the branching ratios of $S$ decay, which can
rule out a Higgs-like decay branching for $S$, in the case where the Madala DM
candidate is assumed to comprise all DM.

small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) by using the diffraction patterns to
reconstruct the surface shape. To model visible light scattering, rigorous
calculations of the near and far field by numerically solving Maxwell's
equations with a finite-element method are well established. The application of
this technique to X-rays is still challenging, due to the discrepancy between
incident wavelength and finite-element size. This drawback vanishes for GISAXS
due to the small angles of incidence, the conical scattering geometry and the
periodicity of the surface structures, which allows a rigorous computation of
the diffraction efficiencies with sufficient numerical precision. To develop
dimensional metrology tools based on GISAXS, lamellar gratings with line widths
down to 55 nm were produced by state-of-the-art e-beam lithography and then
etched into silicon. The high surface sensitivity of GISAXS in conjunction with
a Maxwell solver allows a detailed reconstruction of the grating line shape
also for thick, non-homogeneous substrates. The reconstructed geometrical line
shape models are statistically validated by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling technique which reveals that GISAXS is able to reconstruct
critical parameters like the widths of the lines with sub-nm uncertainty.

we focus on the automatic construction of an optimal viseme vocabulary based on
the association of phonemes with similar appearance. To this end, we construct
an automatic system that uses local appearance descriptors to extract the main
characteristics of the mouth region and HMMs to model the statistic relations
of both viseme and phoneme sequences. To compare the performance of the system
different descriptors (PCA, DCT and SIFT) are analyzed. We test our system in a

constant problem without the need to tune parameters. We propose a simple
computation of the graviton contribution to the flow of the effective potential
for scalar fields. Within variable gravity we find that the potential increases
asymptotically at most quadratically with the scalar field. With effective
Planck mass proportional to the scalar field, the solutions of the derived
cosmological equations lead to an asymptotically vanishing cosmological
""constant"" in the infinite future, providing for dynamical dark energy in the
present cosmological epoch. Beyond a solution of the cosmological constant
problem, our simplified computation also entails a sizeable positive
graviton-induced anomalous dimension for the quartic Higgs coupling in the
ultraviolet regime, substantiating the successful prediction of the Higgs boson
mass within the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity.

monitored by battery-powered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Since battery
replacement of sensor nodes is generally difficult, long-term monitoring can be
only achieved if the operation of the WSN nodes contributes to a long WSN
lifetime. Two prominent techniques to long WSN lifetime are i) optimal sensor
activation and ii) efficient data gathering and forwarding based on compressive
sensing. These techniques are feasible only if the activated sensor nodes
establish a connected communication network (connectivity constraint), and
satisfy a compressive sensing decoding constraint (cardinality constraint).
These two constraints make the problem of maximizing network lifetime via
sensor node activation and compressive sensing NP-hard. To overcome this
difficulty, an alternative approach that iteratively solves energy balancing
problems is proposed. However, understanding whether maximizing network
lifetime and energy balancing problems are aligned objectives is a fundamental
open issue. The analysis reveals that the two optimization problems give
different solutions, but the difference between the lifetime achieved by the
energy balancing approach and the maximum lifetime is small when the initial
energy at sensor nodes is significantly larger than the energy consumed for a
single transmission. The lifetime achieved by the energy balancing is
asymptotically optimal, and that the achievable network lifetime is at least
$50$\% of the optimum. Analysis and numerical simulations quantify the
efficiency of the proposed energy balancing approach.

spectral parameters viz. the average center shift, <CS>, and the relative
recoil-free fraction, f/fo, were explored. The former yielded the Debye
temperature, T_D1, and the mean-square velocity of vibration, <v^2>, while the
latter T_D2 and the mean-square amplitude of vibrations, <x^2>. Significant
differences in the lattice-dynamical behaviors in the magnetic and paramagnetic
phases were revealed. In particular, the values of T_D were notably lower and
those of f/fo greatly higher in the former. This anomalous result has likely
its origin in a remarkably high inharmonic contribution to the vibrations found
for the ground magnetic state (spin-glass). Especially anomalous behavior vs.
temperature exhibits <x^2> where four well defined ranges could have been
identified and ascribed to the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and two spin-glass
phases. Linear correlations between <v^2>-<x^2> were found within each of the
four ranges. They enabled determination of force constants, hence a change of
the potential energy, Ep, in each of the ranges. The total change of Ep=30 meV
while the corresponding one of the kinetic energy, determined from the
knowledge of <v^2>, was Ek=21 meV. The lack of balance between Ep and Ek

to ribbonize and approximate any given surface in space by intrinsically flat
ribbons. The rolling requires that the geodesic curvature along the contact
curve on the surface agrees with the geodesic curvature of the corresponding
Cartan development curve. Essentially, this follows from the orientational
alignment of the two co-moving Darboux frames during rolling. Using closed
contact center curves we obtain closed approximating Cartan ribbons that
contribute zero to the total curvature integral of the ribbonization. This
paves the way for a particularly simple topological inspection -- it is reduced
to the question of how the ribbons organise their edges relative to each other.
The Gauss--Bonnet theorem leads to this topological inspection of the vertices.
Finally, we display two examples of ribbonizations of surfaces, namely of a
torus using two ribbons, and of an ellipsoid using closed curvature lines as
center curves for the ribbons.

input-output relationship of a system, from past observations of its behavior.
Decision trees characterize the input-output relationship through a series of
nested $if-then-else$ questions, the testing nodes, leading to a set of
predictions, the leaf nodes. Several of such trees are often combined together
for state-of-the-art performance: random forest ensembles average the
predictions of randomized decision trees trained independently in parallel,
while tree boosting ensembles train decision trees sequentially to refine the
predictions made by the previous ones. The emergence of new applications
requires scalable supervised learning algorithms in terms of computational
power and memory space with respect to the number of inputs, outputs, and
observations without sacrificing accuracy. In this thesis, we identify three
main areas where decision tree methods could be improved for which we provide
and evaluate original algorithmic solutions: (i) learning over high dimensional
output spaces, (ii) learning with large sample datasets and stringent memory
constraints at prediction time and (iii) learning over high dimensional sparse

achieved great success in pattern recognition. However, there is no clear
understanding of such neural computational models. In this paper, we try to
unravel ""black-box"" structure of Ann model from network flow. Specifically, we
consider the feed forward Ann as a network flow model, which consists of many
directional class-pathways. Each class-pathway encodes one class. The
class-pathway of a class is obtained by connecting the activated neural nodes
in each layer from input to output, where activation value of neural node
(node-value) is defined by the weights of each layer in a trained
ANN-classifier. From the perspective of the class-pathway, training an
ANN-classifier can be regarded as the formulation process of class-pathways of
different classes. By analyzing the the distances of each two class-pathways in
a trained ANN-classifiers, we try to answer the questions, why the classifier
performs so? At last, from the neural encodes view, we define the importance of
each neural node through the class-pathways, which is helpful to optimize the
structure of a classifier. Experiments for two types of ANN model including
multi-layer MLP and CNN verify that the network flow based on class-pathway is
a reasonable explanation for ANN models.

detected by the delayed laser pulses, which are also diffracted by the metallic

order diffracted light. The obtained data contain multiple frequency components
which are interpreted by considering all possible angles for the Brillouin
scattering of light achieved through the multiplexing of the propagation
directions of light and coherent sound by the metallic grating. The emitted
acoustic field can be equivalently presented as a superposition of the plane
inhomogeneous acoustic waves, which constitute an acoustic diffraction grating
for the probe light. Thus, the obtained results can also be interpreted as a
consequence of probe light diffraction by both metallic and acoustic gratings.
The realized scheme of time-domain Brillouin scattering with metallic grating
operating in reflection mode provides access to acoustic frequencies from the
minimal to the maximal possible in a single experimental configuration for the
directions of probe light incidence and scattered light detection. This is
achieved by monitoring of the backward and forward Brillouin scattering
processes in parallel. Applications include measurements of the acoustic
dispersion, simultaneous determination of sound velocity and optical refractive
index, and evaluation of the samples with a single direction of possible

metallicity and luminosity of the galaxy associated to the DLA follow a
relation of the form, ${\rm M_{UV}} = -5 \times \left(\,[{\rm M/H}] + 0.3\,

$\sigma_{DLA} \propto L^{0.8}$. Specifically, our spectroscopic campaign
consists of 11 DLAs preselected based on their equivalent width of SiII
$\lambda1526$ to have a metallicity higher than [Si/H] > -1. The targets have
been observed with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope to
search for emission lines around the quasars. We observe a high detection rate
of 64% (7/11), significantly higher than the typical $\sim$10% for random,
HI-selected DLA samples. We use the aforementioned model, to simulate the
results of our survey together with a range of previous surveys: spectral
stacking, direct imaging (using the `double DLA' technique), long-slit
spectroscopy, and integral field spectroscopy. Based on our model results, we
are able to reconcile all results. Some tension is observed between model and

However, the object to object variations are most likely a result of the
significant scatter in the underlying scaling relations as well as
uncertainties in the amount of dust which affects the emission.

ideal conditions, but only if a simple self-consistency condition is applied.
Such parameters also promote to first-principles a recently proposed DFT+$U$

asymptotic behaviour of periodic evolution families we go on to consider a
special class of dissipative systems arising naturally in applications. For
this class of systems we analyse in detail the spectral properties of the
associated monodromy operator, showing in particular that it is a so-called
Ritt operator under a natural 'resonance' condition. This allows us to deduce
from our general result a precise description of the asymptotic behaviour of
the corresponding solutions. In particular, we present conditions for rational
rates of convergence to periodic solutions in the case where the convergence
fails to be uniformly exponential. We illustrate our general results by
applying them to concrete problems including the one-dimensional wave equation
with periodic damping.

off-centred rings that indicate past or ongoing perturbation, possibly caused
by secular gravitational interaction with unseen stellar or substellar
companions. The purely dynamical aspects of this departure from radial symmetry
are well understood. However, the observed dust is subject to additional forces
and effects, most notably collisions and drag. Aims: To complement the studies
of dynamics, we therefore aim to understand how new asymmetries are created by
the addition of collisional evolution and drag forces, and existing ones
strengthened or overridden. Methods: We augmented our existing numerical code
""Analysis of Collisional Evolution"" (ACE) by an azimuthal dimension, the
longitude of periapse. A set of fiducial discs with global eccentricities
ranging from 0 to 0.4 is evolved over giga-year timescales. Size distribution
and spatial variation of dust are analysed and interpreted. The basic impact of
belt eccentricity on spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images is
discussed.
  Results: We find features imposed on characteristic timescales. First,
radiation pressure defines size cutoffs that differ between periapse and
apoapse, resulting in an asymmetric halo. The differences in size distribution
make the observable asymmetry of the halo depend on wavelength. Second,
collisional equilibrium prefers smaller grains on the apastron side of the
parent belt, reducing the effect of pericentre glow and the overall asymmetry.
Third, Poynting-Robertson drag fills the region interior to an eccentric belt
such that the apastron side is more tenuous. Interpretation and prediction of
the appearance in scattered light is problematic when spatial and size
distribution are coupled.

one can dramatically improve estimates of the parameters that dictate the

regression (i.e., conditional mean) estimates. More generally, standard
regression falls short in any prediction problem where the distribution of the
response is more complex with multi-modality, asymmetry or heteroscedastic

regression and classification only, whereas research on density estimation has
lagged behind. Here we propose FlexCode, a fully nonparametric approach to
conditional density estimation that reformulates CDE as a non-parametric
orthogonal series problem where the expansion coefficients are estimated by
regression. By taking such an approach, one can efficiently estimate
conditional densities and not just expectations in high dimensions by drawing
upon the success in high-dimensional regression. Depending on the choice of
regression procedure, our method can adapt to a variety of challenging
high-dimensional settings with different structures in the data (e.g., a large

model FRB 121102 in light of the new observational results in the active

a non-steady relativistic $e^\pm$-beam, accelerated by an impulsive
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-driven mechanism, interacts with a cloud at the
centre of a star-forming dwarf galaxy. The interaction generates regions of
high electrostatic field called cavitons in the plasma cloud. Turbulence is
also produced in the beam. These processes, plus particle isotropization, the
interaction scale, and light retardation effects, provide the necessary
ingredients for short-lived, bright coherent radiation bursts. The mechanism
studied in this work explains the general properties of FRB 121102, and may

further maximize the secrecy rate. Next, if prior knowledge of the

XMM-Newton public observations from 1999 to 2014 and 2014 Swift data, it has
been argued that the ""bright and very bright"" flaring rate raised from 2014
Aug. 31. Thanks to 482ks of observations performed in 2015 with Chandra,
XMM-Newton and Swift, we test the significance of this rise of flaring rate and
determine the threshold of unabsorbed flare flux or fluence leading to any
flaring-rate change. The mean unabsorbed fluxes of the 107 flares detected in
the 1999-2015 observations are consistently computed from the extracted spectra
and calibration files, assuming the same spectral parameters. We construct the
observed flare fluxes and durations distribution for the XMM-Newton and Chandra
flares and correct it from the detection biases to estimate the intrinsic
distribution from which we determine the average flare detection efficiency for
each observation. We apply the BB algorithm on the flare arrival times
corrected from the corresponding efficiency. We confirm a constant overall
flaring rate in 1999-2015 and a rise in the flaring rate for the most
luminous/energetic flares from 2014 Aug. 31 (4 months after the passage of the
DSO/G2 close to Sgr A*). We also identify a decay of the flaring rate for the
less luminous and less energetic flares from 2013 Aug. and Nov., respectively
(10 and 7 months before the pericenter of the DSO/G2). The decay of the faint
flaring rate is difficult to explain by the tidal disruption of the DSO/G2,
whose stellar nature is now well established, since it occurred well before its
pericenter. Moreover, a mass transfer from the DSO/G2 to Sgr A* is not required
to produce the rise in the bright flaring rate since the energy saved by the
decay of the number of faint flares during a long time period may be later
released by several bright flares during a shorter time period. (abridged)

especially under certain tuning conditions. Here, we are the first to report
the observation of pressure-induced three superconducting transitions in TaTe2,
a charge density wave (CDW) - bearing layered transition-metal dichalcogenide
that is metallic but not superconducting at ambient pressure. We find that its
CDW state can be easily suppressed upon increasing pressure up to ~ 1 GPa. A
superconducting state then emerges from the suppressed CDW state and persists
to the pressure about 7 GPa. Unexpectedly, another superconducting state
appears at ~ 11 GPa within the same monoclinic (M) structure of its
ambient-pressure one. Upon further compression to 21 GPa, a third
superconducting state with higher Tc appears from a high-pressure (HP) phase.
Our experimental results suggest that the pressure-induced three
superconducting transitions in TaTe2 are respectively driven by the suppression
of the CDW state, the change of the angle in the M phase and the transition of
M-to-HP phase. These results demonstrate not only the versatile nature of this
correlated electron system, but also the first experimental example that shows
the pressure-induced evolution from a CDW state to three superconducting states
driven by different mechanisms.

dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation results using the Large- Scale
Plasma (LSP) code that explore intense mid-IR laser interactions with dense
targets. We present the results of thirty PIC simulations over a wide range of
intensities (0.03 < $a_0$ < 39) and wavelengths ({\lambda} =780 nm, 3 {\mu}m,
and 10 {\mu}m). Earlier studies, limited to {\lambda} =780 nm and $a_0 \sim$ 1
[1, 2], identified super-ponderomotive electron acceleration in the laser
specular direction for normal- incidence laser interactions with dense targets.
We extend this research to mid-IR wavelengths and find a more general result
that normal-incidence super-ponderomotive electron acceleration occurs provided
that the laser intensity is not highly relativistic ($a_0 \lesssim 1$) and that
the pre-plasma scale length is similar to or longer than the laser wavelength.
Under these conditions, ejected electron angular and energy distributions are
similar to expectations from an analytic model used in [2]. We also find that,
for $a_0 \sim 1$, the mid-IR simulations exhibit a classic ponderomotive
steepening pattern with multiple peaks in the ion and electron density
distribution. Experimental validation of this basic laser-plasma interaction
process will be possible in the near future using mid-IR laser technology and
interferometry.

influence of the binary using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to
investigate the impact of disk and binary parameters on the dynamical aspects
of the disk. To distinguish between physical and numerical effects we apply
three hydrodynamical codes. First we analyse in detail numerical issues
concerning the conditions at the boundaries and grid resolution. We then
perform a series of simulations with different binary (eccentricity, mass
ratio) and disk parameters (viscosity, aspect ratio) starting from a reference
model with Kepler-16 parameters.
  Concerning the numerical aspects we find that the inner grid radius must be
of the order of the binary semi-major axis, with free outflow conditions
applied such that mass can flow onto the central binary. A closed inner
boundary leads to unstable evolutions.
  We find that the inner disk turns eccentric and precesses for all
investigated physical parameters. The precession rate is slow with periods
($T_\mathrm{prec}$) starting at around 500 binary orbits ($T_\mathrm{bin}$) for
high viscosity and large $H/R$ where the inner hole is smaller and more
circular. Reducing $\alpha$ and $H/R$ increases the gap size and
$T_\mathrm{prec}$ reaches 2500 $T_\mathrm{bin}$. For varying binary mass ratios
$q_\mathrm{bin}$ the gap size remains constant whereas $T_\mathrm{prec}$
decreases for increasing $q_\mathrm{bin}$.
  For varying binary eccentricities $e_\mathrm{bin}$ we find two separate
branches in the gap size and eccentricity diagram. The bifurcation occurs at

where, when, and how millimeter-wave (mmWave) will be used in 5G and beyond.
Since the next generation network is not just a new radio access standard, but
instead an integration of networks for vertical markets with diverse
applications, answers to the question depend on scenarios and use cases to be
deployed. This paper gives four 5G mmWave deployment examples and describes in
chronological order the scenarios and use cases of their probable deployment,
including expected system architectures and hardware prototypes. The paper
starts with 28 GHz outdoor backhauling for fixed wireless access and moving
hotspots, which will be demonstrated at the PyeongChang winter Olympic games in
2018. The second deployment example is a 60 GHz unlicensed indoor access system
at the Tokyo-Narita airport, which is combined with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)
to enable ultra-high speed content download with low latency. The third example
is mmWave mesh network to be used as a micro Radio Access Network ({\mu}-RAN),
for cost-effective backhauling of small-cell Base Stations (BSs) in dense urban
scenarios. The last example is mmWave based Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) and
Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) communications system, which enables automated
driving by exchanging High Definition (HD) dynamic map information between cars
and Roadside Units (RSUs). For 5G and beyond, mmWave and MEC will play
important roles for a diverse set of applications that require both ultra-high
data rate and low latency communications.

angular momenta for the sample. Average values for the disk mass are
3.4$\times$10$^{-9}$ and 9.5$\times$10$^{-10}$ $M_{\star}$ for early (B0-B3)

disk angular momentum relative to the star are between 150-200 and 100-150
$J_{\star}/M_{\star}$, again for early and late-type Be stars respectively. The
distributions of the disk mass and disk angular momentum are different between
early and late-type Be stars at a 1\% level of significance. Finally, we
construct the disk mass distribution for the BeSOS sample as a function of
spectral type and compare it to the predictions of stellar evolutionary models
with rapid rotation. The observed disk masses are typically larger than the
theoretical predictions, although the observed spread in disk masses is
typically large.

correlated many-electron dynamics to non-variational, highly scalable

electronic wave packet is written as a linear combination of $N$-electron wave
functions at the configuration interaction singles (CIS) level, which are
obtained from a reference time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
calculation. The procedure is implemented in the open-source Python program
detCI@ORBKIT, which extends the capabilities of our recently published
post-processing toolbox [J. Comput. Chem. 37 (2016) 1511]. From the output of
standard quantum chemistry packages using atom-centered Gaussian-type basis
functions, the framework exploits the multi-determinental structure of the
hybrid TDDFT/CIS wave packet to compute fundamental one-electron quantities
such as difference electronic densities, transient electronic flux densities,
and transition dipole moments. The hybrid scheme is benchmarked against wave
function data for the laser-driven state selective excitation in LiH. It is
shown that all features of the electron dynamics are in good quantitative
agreement with the higher-level method provided a judicious choice of
functional is made. Broadband excitation of a medium-sized organic chromophore
further demonstrates the scalability of the method. In addition, the
time-dependent flux densities unravel the mechanistic details of the simulated
charge migration process at a glance.

in the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of strange particles ($K_{S}^{0}$, $\rm \Lambda$,

exhibited when the spectra are expressed in a suitable scaling variable
$z=p_{\rm T}/K$, where the scaling parameter $K$ is determined by the quality
factor method and increases with the center of mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$). The
rates at which $K$ increases with $\mathrm{ln}\sqrt{s}$ for these strange

colour string percolation model, we argue that these strange particles are
produced through the decay of clusters that are formed by the colour strings
overlapping. We observe that the strange mesons and baryons are produced from
clusters with different size distributions, while the strange mesons (baryons)
$K_{S}^{0}$ and $\phi$ ($\rm \Lambda$ and $\rm \Xi$) originate from clusters
with the same size distributions. The cluster's size distributions for strange

interferometry techniques. To promote the phase retrieval, Xu et. al [X. Xu, Y.
Wang, Y. Xu, W. Jin. 2016] proposed a method based on dual-wavelength
interferometry. However, the phase-difference brings large noise due to its low
sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Beside, special phase shifts are
required in Xu's method. In the light of these problems, an extended
depth-range dual-wavelength phase-shifting interferometry is proposed. Firstly,
the least squares algorithm is utilized to retrieve the single-wavelength phase
from a sequence of N-frame simultaneous phase-shifting dual-wavelength
interferograms (SPSDWI) with random phase shifts. Then the phase-difference and
phase-sum are calculated from the wrapped phases of single wavelength, and the
iterative two-step temporal phase-unwrapping is introduced to unwrap the
phase-sum, which can extend the depth-range and improve the sensitivity.
Finally, the height of objects is achieved. Simulated experiments are conducted
to demonstrate the superb precision and overall performance of the proposed
method.

generates stronger blueshifts than an L-T island, the BB hump can be made lower
- then it is further removed from the observer and implies a smaller observed
angular radius of the source. Consequently, more sources can be fitted into the

variability reported from active galactic nuclei. We focus on the energy
requirements imposed by these scenarios: (i) external cloud in the jet, (ii)
relativistic blob propagating through the jet material, and (iii) production of
high-energy gamma rays in the magnetosphere gaps. We show that while the first
two scenarios are not constrained by the flare luminosity, there is a robust
upper limit on the luminosity of flares generated in the black hole
magnetosphere. This limit depends weakly on the mass of the central black hole
and is determined by the accretion disk magnetization, viewing angle, and the
pair multiplicity. For the most favorable values of these parameters, the
luminosity for 5-minute flares is limited by $2\times10^{43}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$,
which excludes a black hole magnetosphere origin of the flare detected from
IC310. In the scopes of scenarios (i) and (ii), the jet power, which is
required to explain the IC310 flare, exceeds the jet power estimated based on
the radio data. To resolve this discrepancy in the framework of the scenario
(ii), it is sufficient to assume that the relativistic blobs are not
distributed isotropically in the jet reference frame. A realization of scenario
(i) demands that the jet power during the flare exceeds by a factor $10^2$ the
power of the radio jet relevant to a timescale of $10^8$ years.

in complex quantum materials may self-organise into long range order under
highly non-equilibrium conditions leads to the notion that entirely new and
unexpected functionalities might be artificially created. However,
demonstrating new emergent order in highly non-equilibrium transitions has
proven surprisingly difficult. In spite of huge recent advances in experimental
ultrafast time-resolved techniques, methods that average over successive
transition outcomes have so far proved incapable of elucidating the emerging
spatial structure. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy, we report for the
first time the charge order emerging after a single transition outcome in a
prototypical two-dimensional dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$ initiated by a single
optical pulse. By mapping the vector field of charge displacements of the
emergent state, we find surprisingly intricate, long-range, topologically
non-trivial charge order in which chiral domain tiling is intertwined with
unique unpaired dislocations which play a crucial role in enhancing the
emergent states remarkable stability. The discovery of the principles that lead
to metastability in charge-ordered systems open the way to designing novel
emergent functionalities, particularly ultrafast all-electronic non-volatile
cryo-memories.

telescopes facilities, would benefit from a simple refurbishing that could
increase both the resolution and spectral range in order to cope with the
progressively challenging scientific requirements but, in order to make this
update appealing, it should minimize the changes in the existing structure of
the instrument. In the past, many authors proposed solutions based on stacking
subsequently layers of dispersive elements and record multiple spectra in one
shot (multiplexing). Although this idea is promising, it brings several
drawbacks and complexities that prevent the straightforward integration of a
such device in a spectrograph. Fortunately nowadays, the situation has changed
dramatically thanks to the successful experience achieved through
photopolymeric holographic films, used to fabricate common Volume Phase
Holographic Gratings (VPHGs). Thanks to the various advantages made available
by these materials in this context, we propose an innovative solution to design
a stacked multiplexed VPHGs that is able to secure efficiently different
spectra in a single shot. This allows to increase resolution and spectral range
enabling astronomers to greatly economize their awarded time at the telescope.
In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of our solution, both in terms
of expected performance and feasibility, supposing the upgrade of the Gran

them well-suited for providing broadband services in sparsely populated regions
where economic factors hinder deployment of such services on licensed spectrum.
In this context, this paper explores the deployment of an outdoor Wi-Fi-like
network operating in TVWS channels, referred to commonly as a Super Wi-Fi
network. Since regulations governing unlicensed use of these channels allow (a)
mounting fixed devices up to a height of 30 m and operation at transmit powers
of up to 4 W EIRP, and (b) operation at transmit powers of up to 100 mW EIRP
for portable devices, such networks can provide extended coverage and higher
rates than traditional Wi-Fi networks. However, these gains are subject to the
viability of the uplink from the portable devices (clients) to the fixed
devices (access points (AP)) because of tighter restrictions on transmit power
of clients compared to APs. This paper leverages concepts from stochastic
geometry to study the performance of such networks with specific focus on the
effect of (a) transmit power asymmetry between APs and clients and its impact
on uplink viability and coverage, and (b) the interplay between height and
transmit power of APs in determining the network throughput. Such an analysis
reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when
APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of
more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is
prioritized over coverage.

  The nuclear structure of the cluster bands in $^{20}$Ne presents a challenge
for different theoretical approaches. It is especially difficult to explain the
broad 0$^+$, 2$^+$ states at 9 MeV excitation energy. Simultaneously, it is
important to obtain more reliable experimental data for these levels in order
to quantitatively assess the theoretical framework.
  Purpose
  To obtain new data on $^{20}$Ne $\alpha$ cluster structure. Method Thick
target inverse kinematics technique was used to study the $^{16}$O+$\alpha$
resonance elastic scattering and the data were analyzed using an \textit{R}
matrix approach. The $^{20}$Ne spectrum, the cluster and nucleon spectroscopic
factors were calculated using cluster-nucleon configuration interaction model
(CNCIM).
  Results
  We determined the parameters of the broad resonances in
\textsuperscript{20}Ne: 0$^+$ level at 8.77 $\pm$ 0.150 MeV with a width of 750
(+500/-220) keV; 2$^+$ level at 8.75 $\pm$ 0.100 MeV with the width of 695
$\pm$ 120 keV; the width of 9.48 MeV level of 65 $\pm$ 20 keV and showed that
9.19 MeV, 2$^+$ level (if exists) should have width $\leq$ 10 keV. The detailed
comparison of the theoretical CNCIM predictions with the experimental data on
cluster states was made.
  Conclusions
  Our experimental results by the TTIK method generally confirm the adopted
data on $\alpha$ cluster levels in $^{20}$Ne. The CNCIM gives a good
description of the $^{20}$Ne positive parity states up to an excitation energy
of $\sim$ 7 MeV, predicting reasonably well the excitation energy of the states
and their cluster and single particle properties. At higher excitations, the
qualitative disagreement with the experimentally observed structure is evident,
especially for broad resonances.

  Covariance Penalties, and Prediction Error Estimation",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In statistical prediction, classical approaches for model selection and model
evaluation based on covariance penalties are still widely used. Most of the
literature on this topic is based on what we call the ""Fixed-X"" assumption,
where covariate values are assumed to be nonrandom. By contrast, it is often
more reasonable to take a ""Random-X"" view, where the covariate values are
independently drawn for both training and prediction. To study the
applicability of covariance penalties in this setting, we propose a
decomposition of Random-X prediction error in which the randomness in the
covariates contributes to both the bias and variance components. This
decomposition is general, but we concentrate on the fundamental case of least
squares regression. We prove that in this setting the move from Fixed-X to
Random-X prediction results in an increase in both bias and variance. When the
covariates are normally distributed and the linear model is unbiased, all terms
in this decomposition are explicitly computable, which yields an extension of
Mallows' Cp that we call $RCp$. $RCp$ also holds asymptotically for certain
classes of nonnormal covariates. When the noise variance is unknown, plugging
in the usual unbiased estimate leads to an approach that we call $\hat{RCp}$,
which is closely related to Sp (Tukey 1967), and GCV (Craven and Wahba 1978).
For excess bias, we propose an estimate based on the ""shortcut-formula"" for
ordinary cross-validation (OCV), resulting in an approach we call $RCp^+$.
Theoretical arguments and numerical simulations suggest that $RCP^+$ is
typically superior to OCV, though the difference is small. We further examine
the Random-X error of other popular estimators. The surprising result we get
for ridge regression is that, in the heavily-regularized regime, Random-X
variance is smaller than Fixed-X variance, which can lead to smaller overall
Random-X error.

stable? This question has been explored on a few different macroeconomic
models, and both `yes' and `no' answers have been obtained. However, economies
can become unstable whether or not there is ongoing underlying growth in
productivity with which to sustain growth in output. Here we attempt, for the
first time, to assess via a model the relative stability of growth versus
no-growth scenarios. The model employed draws from Keen's model of the Minsky
financial instability hypothesis. The analysis focuses on dynamics as opposed
to equilibrium, and scenarios of growth and no-growth of output (GDP) are
obtained by tweaking a productivity growth input parameter. We confirm that,
with or without growth, there can be both stable and unstable scenarios. To
maintain stability, firms must not change their debt levels or target debt
levels too quickly. Further, according to the model, the wages share is higher
for zero-growth scenarios, although there are more frequent substantial drops
in employment.

energy barriers, in the absence of currents, without forming Bloch points. It
is reported that the pinning sites, which are required to allow thermally
stable bits, significantly increase the critical current densities to move the

extending more than +/-1500 km/s from the line center. The lines display radial
velocity variations in phase with the radial velocity variation expected of the
compact star, and they show a distortion during disk eclipse that we interpret
as a rotational distortion. We fit the line profiles with a model in which the
emission comes from the surface of a symmetric, Keplerian accretion disk around
the compact object. The outer edge of the disk has velocities that vary from
110 to 190 km/s. These comparatively low velocities place an important
constraint on the mass of the compact star: Its mass must be less than 2.2
M_solar and is probably less than 1.6 M_solar.

propose a methodology for the parametric representation, estimation, and

of the methodology lies in the fact that even if only one persistence diagram

replications can be generated to allow for conventional statistical hypothesis
testing. The methodology is conceptually simple and computationally practical,
and provides a broadly effective statistical procedure for persistence diagram
TDA analysis. We demonstrate the basic ideas on a toy example, and the power of
the approach in a novel and revealing analysis of CMB non-homogeneity.

method is applied to a general study of deep and recurrent neural networks via
the analysis of random matrix ensembles mimicking typical weight matrices of
those systems. In particular, we examine circular random matrix ensembles:
circular unitary ensemble (CUE), circular orthogonal ensemble (COE), and
circular symplectic ensemble (CSE). Eigenvalue spectra and spectral ergodicity
are computed for those ensembles as a function of network size. It is observed
that as the matrix size increases the level of spectral ergodicity of the
ensemble rises, i.e., the eigenvalue spectra obtained for a single realisation
at random from the ensemble is closer to the spectra obtained averaging over
the whole ensemble. Based on previous results we conjecture that success of
deep learning architectures is strongly bound to the concept of spectral
ergodicity. The method to compute spectral ergodicity proposed in this work
could be used to optimise the size and architecture of deep as well as
recurrent neural networks.

underpin tumor initiation and progression. This task is challenging as the
mutational profiles of cancer genomes exhibit vast heterogeneity, with many
alterations observed within each individual, few shared somatically mutated
genes across individuals, and important roles in cancer for both frequently and
infrequently mutated genes. While commonly mutated cancer genes are readily
identifiable, those that are rarely mutated across samples are difficult to
distinguish from the large numbers of other infrequently mutated genes. Here,
we introduce a method that considers per-individual mutational profiles within
the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small
connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated,
comprise pathways that are perturbed across (i.e., ""cover"") a large fraction of
the individuals. We devise a simple yet intuitive objective function that
balances identifying a small subset of genes with covering a large fraction of
individuals. We show how to solve this problem optimally using integer linear
programming and also give a fast heuristic algorithm that works well in
practice. We perform a large-scale evaluation of our resulting method, nCOP, on
6,038 TCGA tumor samples across 24 different cancer types. We demonstrate that
our approach nCOP is more effective in identifying cancer genes than both
methods that do not utilize any network information as well as state-of-the-art
network-based methods that aggregate mutational information across individuals.
Overall, our work demonstrates the power of combining per-individual mutational
information with interaction networks in order to uncover genes functionally
relevant in cancers, and in particular those genes that are less frequently
mutated.

particularly for systems composed of complex molecules whose force fields (FFs)
are characterized by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular terms
(referred to herein as ""flexible FFs""). The calculation of a thermodynamic
property for a system whose molecules are described by such a FF involves the
calculation of the residual property prior to its addition to the corresponding
ideal-gas (IG) property, the latter of which is separately calculated, either
using thermochemical compilations or nowadays accurate quantum mechanical
calculations. Although the simulation of a volumetric residual property
proceeds by simply replacing the intermolecular FF in the rigid molecule case
by the total (intramolecular plus intermolecular) FF, this is not the case for
a caloric property. We discuss the methodology required in performing such

three approximations for the calculation procedure, and illustrate their

identifying the dimensionality of the system underlying the time series through
a convergence measure derived from the probability distribution of the local

simulations of critical dynamic material behavior has been hampered by a
spurious wave reflection problem at the atomistic-continuum interface. This
problem is mainly caused by the difference in material descriptions between the
atomistic and continuum models, which results in a mismatch in phonon
dispersion relations. In this work, we introduce a new method based on
atomistic dynamics of lattice coupled with a concurrent atomistic-continuum
method to enable a full phonon representation in the continuum description.
This then permits the passage of short-wavelength, high-frequency phonon waves
from the atomistic to continuum regions. The benchmark examples presented in
this work demonstrate that the new scheme enables the passage of all allowable
phonons through the atomistic-continuum interface; it also preserves the wave
coherency and energy conservation after phonons transport across multiple
atomistic-continuum interfaces. This work is the first step towards developing
a concurrent atomistic-continuum simulation tool for non-equilibrium
phonon-mediated thermal transport in materials with microstructural complexity.

to determine the absolute location and size of the focal spot in a tight
focused ultrashort laser pulse. The method permits to accurately position a
target in the focal spot with a fast response. The technique is designed to
help to automatize the location of an overdense target in focus in a laser
plasma experiment. The method allows for a fast localization of the focal
position and the relative motion of the target with respect to it. As an
example of the capacities we measure the defocusing of a fast rotating disc in
several radius to reconstruct the motion of the disc at focus.

displays wettings transitions between three distinctive phases when in contact
with an impenetrable wall. The particles in the model move persistently,
tumbling with a small rate $\alpha$, and interact via exclusion volume only.
When increasing the tumbling rates $\alpha$, the system transits from total
wetting to partial wetting and unwetting phases. In the first phase, a wetting
film covers the wall, with increasing heights when $\alpha$ is reduced. The
second phase is characterized by wetting droplets on the wall with a periodic
spacing between them. Finally, the wall dries with few particles in contact
with it. These phases present nonequilibrium transitions. The first transition,
from partial to total wetting, is continuous and the fraction of dry sites
vanishes continuously when decreasing the tumbling rate $\alpha$. For the
second transition, from partial wetting to dry, the mean droplet distance
diverges logarithmically when approaching the critical tumbling rate, with
saturation due to finite-size effects.

kinetic discrimination. In this mechanism larger dissipation and copying
velocity result in improved copying accuracy. We consider a model of a
polymerase which simultaneously copies a single stranded RNA and opens a
single- to double-stranded junction serving as an obstacle. The presence of the
obstacle slows down the motor, resulting in a change of its fidelity, which can
be used to gain information about the motor and junction dynamics. We find that
the motor's fidelity does not depend on details of the motor-junction
interaction, such as whether the interaction is passive or active. Analysis of
the copying fidelity can still be used as a tool for investigating the junction
kinetics.

  example",,,,,"math.CA","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  A new derivative, called deformable derivative, is introduced here which is
equivalent to ordinary derivative in the sense that one implies other. The
deformable derivative is defined using limit approach like that of ordinary one
but with respect to a parameter varying over unit interval. Thus it could also
be regarded as a fractional derivative. Reason of calling it as deformable
derivative is because of its intrinsic property of continuously deforming
function to derivative. This is substantiated by its linear connection to
function and its derivative. Besides discussing some of its basic properties,
we discover the forms of Rolle's, Mean Value and Taylor's theorems. The
fundamental theorem of calculus for this fractional derivative could be taken
as definition of its fractional integral. As a theoretical application some
fractional differential equations are solved.

data rate is very low due to the slow nature of diffusion and the existence of
severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technique can be used to improve the data rate. Knowledge of channel impulse
response (CIR) is essential for equalization and detection in MIMO systems.
This paper presents a training-based CIR estimation for diffusive MIMO (D-MIMO)
channels. Maximum likelihood and least-squares estimators are derived, and the
training sequences are designed to minimize the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao
bound. Sub-optimal estimators are compared to Cram\'er-Rao bound to validate
their performance.
