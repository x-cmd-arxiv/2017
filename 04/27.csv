demonstrated adiabatic circuits require three-phase bias/clock signals
generated by room temperature sources. A while ago, we suggested that a
multi-phase bias/clock could be provided by a local Josephson junction-based
generator. The generator looks like a long annular Josephson junction, only
composed of discreet elements - junctions and inductors, and closed into a ring
via a flux pump to inject any required number of vortices into the ring. A
steady motion of the vortices forced by a uniformly distributed dc bias current
applied to the ring is accompanied by a nearly harmonic ac currents flowing via
the Josephson junctions (JJs) connected in series with small inductors. These
ac currents serve as multi-phase bias/clock for nSQUID-based circuitry. To
verify this concept and compare the dissipated energy with kBTln2 threshold, we
developed a ring composed of 256 unshunted JJs with 20 {\mu}A target critical
current, Ic. We investigated the behavior of the ring oscillator at each vortex
count from 0 to 256. The measured critical current of the ring with vortices
was about 0.1 {\mu}A per one JJ, which can be explained by unavoidable
nonuniformity of the ring components and the influence of fluxes frozen near
the ring. The corresponding energy dissipation, about 10kBT per passage of one
vortex through one JJ, should be reduced further for prospective experiments
with reversible circuits. However, obtained I-V characteristics could be of
interest for scientists working with long Josephson junctions. Superiority of
the fabrication process used in this work is demonstrated by the obtained about
200 times reduction of Ic of the ring with vortices with respect to a single
comprising JJ, much larger than in any previously described case.

  With its roadmap the Panel documents the approved objectives and milestones
of the experiments that are presently in operation or under construction.
Approval, construction and exploitation milestones are presented for
experiments that are being considered for approval. The timetable proposed by
the proponents is presented for experiments that are not yet being considered
formally for approval. Based on this information, the evolution of the
precision with which the critical parameters governinger the neutrino are known
has been evaluated. Branch or decision points have been identified based on the
anticipated evolution in precision. The branch or decision points have in turn
been used to identify desirable timelines for the neutrino-nucleus cross
section and hadro-production measurements that are required to maximise the
integrated scientific output of the programme. The branch points have also been
used to identify the timeline for the R&D required to take the programme beyond

for key establishment capable of protecting quantum and classical legitimate

cryptographically meaningful perspective because they were sound only in a
worst-case scenario. Here, we extend our results and prove that for any e > 0,
there is a classical protocol that allows the legitimate parties to establish a
common key after O(N) expected queries to a random oracle, yet any quantum
eavesdropper will have a vanishing probability of learning their key after
O(N^{1.5-e}) queries to the same oracle. The vanishing probability applies to a
typical run of the protocol. If we allow the legitimate parties to use a
quantum computer as well, their advantage over the quantum eavesdropper becomes
arbitrarily close to the quadratic advantage that classical legitimate parties
enjoyed over classical eavesdroppers in the seminal 1974 work of Ralph Merkle.
Along the way, we develop new tools to give lower bounds on the number of
quantum queries required to distinguish two probability distributions. This
method in itself could have multiple applications in cryptography. We use it
here to study average-case quantum query complexity, for which we develop a new
composition theorem of independent interest.

all standard missing data strategies. Specifically, we show that the expected

PMKS generally outperforms zero-imputation, mean-imputation, complete-case

degree of improvement is highly dependent on the missingness mechanism and the
effect size of missing predictors. When the data are Missing at Random (MAR) MI
can yield comparable forecasting performance but generally requires a larger
computational cost. We see that predictions from the PMKS are equivalent to the
limiting predictions for a MI procedure that uses a mean model dependent on

renormalization group transformation based on Gaussian elimination, from the
Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem, of high momentum modes above a finite, floating
cutoff scale. The procedure identifies a richer structure than the one we found
in the literature. Namely, it directly yields an equation that determines the
renormalized Hamiltonians as functions of the floating cutoff: solutions to
this equation exhibit, in addition to the limit-cycle, also the
asymptotic-freedom, triviality, and fixed-point behaviors, the latter in
vicinity of infinitely many separate pairs of fixed points in different partial
waves for different values of $g$.

challenging to compare results from MD simulations to experimental results for

sodium silicate glass with varying cooling rate (from 0.01 to 100 K/ps), here
we show that thermal history primarily affects the medium-range order
structure, while the short-range order is largely unaffected over the range of
cooling rates simulated. This results in a decoupling between the enthalpy and
volume relaxation functions, where the enthalpy quickly plateaus as the cooling
rate decreases, whereas density exhibits a slower relaxation. Finally, we
demonstrate that the outcomes of MD simulations can be meaningfully compared to
experimental values if properly extrapolated to slower cooling rates.

  Carlo Methods","This is the author's submitted PhD thesis, still in the referee
  process",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this dissertation we study the tractability of the information-based
complexity $n(\varepsilon,d)$ for $d$-variate function approximation problems.
In the deterministic setting for many unweighted problems the curse of
dimensionality holds, that means, for some fixed error tolerance
$\varepsilon>0$ the complexity $n(\varepsilon,d)$ grows exponentially in $d$.
For integration problems one can usually break the curse with the standard
Monte Carlo method. For function approximation problems, however, similar
effects of randomization have been unknown so far.
  The thesis contains results on three more or less stand-alone topics. For an
extended five page abstract, see the section ""Introduction and Results"".
  Chapter 2 is concerned with lower bounds for the Monte Carlo error for
general linear problems via Bernstein numbers. This technique is applied to the
$L_{\infty}$-approximation of certain classes of $C^{\infty}$-functions, where
it turns out that randomization does not affect the tractability classification
of the problem.
  Chapter 3 studies the $L_{\infty}$-approximation of functions from Hilbert
spaces with methods that may use arbitrary linear functionals as information.
For certain classes of periodic functions from unweighted periodic tensor
product spaces, in particular Korobov spaces, we observe the curse of
dimensionality in the deterministic setting, while with randomized methods we
achieve polynomial tractability.
  Chapter 4 deals with the $L_1$-approximation of monotone functions via
function values. It is known that this problem suffers from the curse in the
deterministic setting. An improved lower bound shows that the problem is still
intractable in the randomized setting. However, Monte Carlo breaks the curse,
in detail, for any fixed error tolerance $\varepsilon>0$ the complexity
$n(\varepsilon,d)$ grows exponentially in $\sqrt{d}$ only.

video frame based on her viewing direction. However, today's 360-degree video
players always fetch the entire panoramic view regardless of users' head
movement, leading to significant bandwidth waste that can be potentially
avoided. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive streaming scheme for
360-degree videos. The basic idea is to fetch the invisible portion of a video
at the lowest quality based on users' head movement prediction and to
adaptively decide the video playback quality for the visible portion based on
bandwidth prediction. Doing both in a robust manner requires overcome a series
of challenges, such as jointly considering the spatial and temporal domains,
tolerating prediction errors, and achieving low complexity. To overcome these
challenges, we first define quality of experience (QoE) metrics for adaptive
360-degree video streaming. We then formulate an optimization problem and solve
it at a low complexity. The algorithm strategically leverages both future
bandwidth and the distribution of users' head positions to determine the
quality level of each tile (i.e., a sub-area of a raw frame). We further
provide theoretical proof showing that our algorithm achieves optimality under
practical assumptions. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms
significantly boost the user QoE by at least 20\% compared to baseline
algorithms.

young stellar objects (mYSOs) are deeply embedded in their parental clouds,
they are rare and thus typically distant, and their reddened spectra usually
preclude the determination of their photospheric parameters. M17 is one of the
best studied HII regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young
stellar population. With X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope we have
obtained optical to near-infrared spectra of candidate mYSOs, identified by
Hanson et al. (1997), and a few OB stars in this region. The large wavelength
coverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of their photospheres and
circumstellar disks. We confirm the pre-main sequence (PMS) nature of six of
the stars and characterise the O stars. The PMS stars have radii consistent
with being contracting towards the main sequence and are surrounded by a
remnant accretion disk. The observed infrared excess and the (double-peaked)
emission lines provide the opportunity to measure structured velocity profiles
in the disks. We compare the observed properties of this unique sample of young
massive stars with evolutionary tracks of massive protostars by Hosokawa &
Omukai (2009), and propose that these mYSOs near the western edge of the HII
region are on their way to become main-sequence stars ($\sim 6 - 20$
$M_{\odot}$) after having undergone high mass-accretion rates (${\dot{M}_{\rm
acc}} \sim 10^{-4} - 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ $\rm yr^{-1}$). Their spin
distribution upon arrival at the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) is consistent
with that observed for young B stars, assuming conservation of angular momentum
and homologous contraction.

setting up the Local and Loop I superbubble, we took into account the time
sequence and locations of the generating core-collapse supernova explosions,
which were derived from the mass spectrum of the perished members of certain
stellar moving groups. The release of 60Fe and its subsequent turbulent mixing
process inside the superbubble cavities was followed via passive scalars, where
the yields of the decaying radioisotope were adjusted according to recent
stellar evolution calculations. The models are able to reproduce both the
timing and the intensity of the 60Fe excess observed with rather high
precision, provided that the external density does not exceed 0.3 cm-3 on

reconstruction analyses use quadratic estimators, which are easily applicable
to data. However, these estimators are known to be suboptimal, in particular
for polarization, and large improvements are expected to be possible for high

iteratively reconstructing the primordial unlensed CMB using a deflection
estimate and its inverse, and removing residual lensing from these maps with

large cosine angle with the target parameter vector, a sample-splitting version
of the EM algorithm converges to the true coefficient vector with high

of estimating the centers of a symmetric mixture of two Gaussians by EM. We
also show that the population EM operator for mixtures of two regressions is
anti-contractive from the target parameter vector if the cosine angle between
the input vector and the target parameter vector is too small, thereby
establishing the necessity of our conic condition. Finally, we give empirical
evidence supporting this theoretical observation, which suggests that the

accurate measurements of the extent of the optically thick area of the planet
at multiple wavelengths with a precision $\lesssim$100 parts per million (ppm).
Next-generation instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are
expected to achieve $\sim$10 ppm precision for several tens of targets. A
similar precision can be obtained in modelling only if other astrophysical
effects, including the stellar limb-darkening, are accounted for properly. In
this paper, we explore the limits on precision due to the mathematical formulas
currently adopted to approximate the stellar limb-darkening, and to the use of
limb-darkening coefficients obtained either from stellar-atmosphere models or
empirically. We propose a new limb-darkening law with two coefficients,
`power-2', which outperforms other two-coefficient laws adopted in the
literature in most cases, and particularly for cool stars. Empirical
limb-darkening based on two-coefficient formulas can be significantly biased,
even if the light-curve residuals are nearly photon-noise limited. We
demonstrate an optimal strategy to fitting for the four-coefficients
limb-darkening in the visible, using prior information on the exoplanet orbital
parameters to break some of the degeneracies that otherwise would prevent the
convergence of the fit. Infrared observations taken with the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) will provide accurate measurements of the exoplanet orbital
parameters with unprecedented precision, which can be used as priors to improve
the stellar limb-darkening characterization, and therefore the inferred
exoplanet parameters, from observations in the visible, such as those taken

contribution is a decremental data structure that supports sensitivity queries
of the form ""are $ u $ and $ v $ strongly connected in the graph $ G \setminus
w $?"", for any triple of vertices $ u, v, w $, while $ G $ undergoes deletions
of edges. Our data structure processes a sequence of edge deletions in a
digraph with $n$ vertices in $O(m n \log{n})$ total time and $O(n^2 \log{n})$
space, where $m$ is the number of edges before any deletion, and answers the
above queries in constant time. We can leverage our data structure to obtain
decremental data structures for many more types of queries within the same time
and space complexity. For instance for edge-related queries, such as testing
whether two query vertices $u$ and $v$ are strongly connected in $G \setminus
e$, for some query edge $e$.
  As another important application of our decremental data structure, we
provide the first nontrivial algorithm for maintaining the dominator tree of a
flow graph under edge deletions. We present an algorithm that processes a
sequence of edge deletions in a flow graph in $O(m n \log{n})$ total time and
$O(n^2 \log{n})$ space. For reducible flow graphs we provide an $O(mn)$-time
and $O(m + n)$-space algorithm. We give a conditional lower bound that provides
evidence that these running times may be tight up to subpolynomial factors.

unforeseen failures in the network infrastructure. They and their dual
counterpart, network flow interdiction, have received steady attention within
the operations research community over the past years. One of the most basic
models is the Maximum Robust Flow Problem: Given a network and an integer k,
the task is to find a path flow of maximum robust value, i.e., the guaranteed
value of surviving flow after removal of any k arcs in the network. The
complexity of this problem appeared to have been settled almost a decade ago:
Aneja et al. (2001) showed that the problem can be solved efficiently when k =
1, while an article by Du and Chandrasekaran (2007) established that the
problem is NP-hard for any constant value of k larger than 1.
  We point to a flaw in the proof of the latter result, leaving the complexity
for constant k open once again. For the case that k is not bounded by a
constant, we present a new hardness proof, establishing that the problem is
strongly NP-hard, even when only two different capacity values occur and the
number of paths is polynomial in the size of the input. We further show that
computing optimal integral solutions is already NP-hard for k = 2 (whereas for
k=1, an efficient algorithm is known) and give a positive result for the case
that capacities are in {1, 2}.

network, but the former is considerably challenging due to probabilistic
generation of single photons and multiplicative loss. Here we demonstrate a
two-dimensional continuous-time quantum walk by using the external geometry of

confirm that the deuterium abundance is very close to the primordial value. The
chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees
quantitatively with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find
that the relation between the deuterium and oxygen abundance exhibits very
little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift
observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of 2.549 +/-
0.033 x 10^-5 and stress that future observations at higher metallicity can
also be used to constrain this value. At fixed metallicity, the deuterium
fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due to the increased
importance of mass loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the
evolution of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its
star formation history. Our simulations are consistent with observations of the
Milky Way's interstellar medium: the deuterium fraction at the solar circle is
85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations to
make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium
abundance is lower at smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies,
showing that stellar mass loss is more important for fuelling star formation in
these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting onto galaxies has a
deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' interstellar medium, but below
the primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the
intergalactic medium and gas previously ejected or stripped from galaxies.

reinforced by the discovery of ultrafast outflows at $\sim 0.1$-$0.2c$ in the
high resolution spectra of a handful of ULXs, as predicted by models of
supercritical accretion discs. Under the assumption that ULXs are powered by
super-Eddington accretion onto black holes, we use the properties of the

$\sim 10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, i.e. $\approx 10$ times larger than the
Eddington limit calculated with a radiative efficiency of 0.1. However, the
emitted luminosity is only $\approx 10\%$ beyond the Eddington luminosity,
because most of the energy released in the inner part of the accretion disc is
used to accelerate the wind, which implies radiative efficiency $\sim 0.01$.

cosmological simulations of late-type galaxies performed with the moving-mesh
code AREPO. Our goal is to explore whether a significant accreted (or ex-situ)
stellar component in the Milky Way disc could be hidden within the
near-circular orbit population, which is strongly dominated by stars born
in-situ. One third of our models shows a significant ex-situ disc but this
fraction would be larger if constraints on orbital circularity were relaxed.
Most of the ex-situ material ($\gtrsim 50\%$) comes from single massive
satellites ($> 6 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$). These satellites are accreted with
a wide range of infall times and inclination angles (up to $85^{\circ}$).
Ex-situ discs are thicker, older and more metal-poor than their in-situ
counterparts. They show a flat median age profile, which differs from the
negative gradient observed in the in-situ component. As a result, the
likelihood of identifying an ex-situ disc in samples of old stars on
near-circular orbits increases towards the outskirts of the disc. We show three
examples that, in addition to ex-situ discs, have a strongly rotating dark
matter component. Interestingly, two of these ex-situ stellar discs show an
orbital circularity distribution that is consistent with that of the in-situ
disc. Thus, they would not be detected in typical kinematic studies.

high-mass stars. We observed this prestellar clump candidate with the SMA
(~3.5"" resolution) and JVLA (~2.1"" resolution) in order to characterize the
early stages of high-mass star formation and to constrain theoretical models.
Dust emission at 1.3 mm wavelength reveals 5 cores with masses <15 Msun. None
of the cores currently have the mass reservoir to form a high-mass star in the
prestellar phase. If the MM1 clump will ultimately form high-mass stars, its
embedded cores must gather a significant amount of additional mass over time.
No molecular outflows are detected in the CO (2-1) and SiO (5-4) transitions,
suggesting that the SMA cores are starless. By using the NH3 (1,1) line, the
velocity dispersion of the gas is determined to be transonic or mildly
supersonic (DeltaV_nt}/DeltaV_th ~1.1-1.8). The cores are not highly supersonic
as some theories of high-mass star formation predict. The embedded cores are 4
to 7 times more massive than the clump thermal Jeans mass and the most massive

relatively unexplored extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational
interaction is strong, non-linear and highly dynamical. Recent gravitational
wave observations by advanced LIGO have provided the first glimpses into this
regime, allowing for the extraction of new inferences on different aspects of
theoretical physics. For example, these detections provide constraints on the
mass of the graviton, Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector, the
existence of large extra dimensions, the temporal variability of Newton's
gravitational constant, and modified dispersion relations of gravitational
waves. Many of these constraints, however, are not yet competitive with
constraints obtained, for example, through Solar System observations or binary
pulsar observations. In this paper, we study the degree to which theoretical
physics inferences drawn from gravitational wave observations will strengthen
with detections from future detectors. We consider future ground-based
detectors, such as the LIGO-class expansions A+, Voyager, Cosmic Explorer and
the Einstein Telescope, as well as various configurations the space-based
detector LISA. We find that space-based detectors will place constraints on
General Relativity up to 12 orders of magnitude more stringently than current
aLIGO bounds, but these space-based constraints are comparable to those
obtained with the ground-based Cosmic Explorer or the Einstein Telescope. We
also generically find that improvements in the instrument sensitivity band at
low frequencies lead to large improvements in certain classes of constraints,
while sensitivity improvements at high frequencies lead to more modest gains.
These results strengthen the case for the development of future detectors,

inhomogeneity than expected. These results provide key insights into energy
dissipation of 2D semiconductors and pave the way for the future design of

applications with random memory access pattern are latency-bound and may suffer
from performance degradation when using only MCDRAM. For those applications,
the use of additional hardware threads may help hide latency and achieve higher

observed in NGC3982, NGC4501 and NGC4450. For NGC4501 and NGC4450, many of
these deviations are spatially coincident with dust structures seen in optical

to loss of angular momentum, allowing the gas to be transferred inwards to feed
the AGN. In the case of NGC2787, instead of deviations in the rotation field,
we see a misalignment of 40{^\circ} between the orientation of the line of

find this likelihood ratio paradigm to be unsupported by arguments of Bayesian

argue that decision theory does not exempt the presentation of a likelihood

assessing the uncertainty in an evaluation of a likelihood ratio. We

carefully identifying the vacua inside the affine Weyl chamber using Verma
bases and Frobenius formula techniques. Theories with fermions in pure

four-index symmetric representation of $su(2)$ and adjoint representation of
$su(N_c)$. However, we find a plethora of admissible theories with fermions in
mixed representations. A sub-class of these theories have degenerate
perturbative vacua separated by domain walls. In particular, $su(N_c)$ theories
with fermions in the mixed representations adjoint$\oplus$fundamental and
adjoint$\oplus$two-index symmetric admit degenerate vacua that spontaneously
break the parity ${\cal P}$, charge conjugation ${\cal C}$, and time reversal
${\cal T}$ symmetries. These are the first examples of strictly weakly coupled
gauge theories on $\mathbb R^3 \times \mathbb S^1$ with spontaneously broken
${\cal C}$, ${\cal P}$, and ${\cal T}$ symmetries. We also compute the fermion
zero modes in the background of monopole-instantons. The monopoles and their
composites (topological molecules) proliferate in the vacuum leading to the
confinement of electric charges. Interestingly enough, some theories have also
accidental degenerate vacua, which are not related by any symmetry. These vacua
admit different numbers of fermionic zero modes, and hence, different kinds of
topological molecules. The lack of symmetry, however, indicates that such
degeneracy might be lifted by higher order corrections.

well-suited to the low signal-to-noise regime that the redshifted 21-cm HI

allowing for robust source detection. After selecting a set of continuum
objects relevant to large, cosmological-scale surveys with the first phase of
the SKA dish array (SKA1-MID), we simulate data corresponding to their HI line
emission as observed by the same telescope. We then use the MultiNest nested
sampling code to find the best-fitting parametrised line profile, providing us
with a full joint posterior probability distribution for the galaxy properties,
including redshift. This provides high quality redshifts, with redshift errors
$\Delta z / z <10^{-5}$, from radio data alone for some 1.8 million galaxies in
a representative 5000 square degree survey with the SKA1-MID instrument with
up-to-date sensitivity profiles. Interestingly, we find that the SNR definition
commonly used in forecast papers does not correlate well with the actual
detectability of an HI line using our method. We further detail how our method

robust constraints on other observables such as the HI mass function. We also
make our line fitting code publicly available for application to other data

Markovian evolution. The properties of the long-time-averaged state and the

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still unclear. A common mechanism is a
neutrino driven outflow, but others have been proposed. Among those, a
long-standing idea is that jets play an important role in SN explosions.
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that accompany rare and powerful CCSNe, sometimes
called ""hypernovae"", provide a clear evidence for a jet activity. The
relativistic GRB jet punches a hole in the stellar envelope and produces the
observed gamma-rays far outside the progenitor star. While SNe and jets coexist
in long GRBs, the relation between the mechanisms driving the hypernova and the
jet is unknown. Also unclear is the relation between the rare hypernovae and
the more common CCSNe. Here we {present observational evidence that indicates}
that choked jets are active in CCSNe types that are not associated with GRBs. A
choked jet deposits all its energy in a cocoon. The cocoon eventually breaks
out from the star releasing energetic material at very high, yet
sub-relativistic, velocities. This fast moving material has a unique signature
that can be detected in early time SN spectra. We find a clear evidence for
this signature in several CCSNe, all involving progenitors that have lost all,
or most, of their hydrogen envelope prior to the explosion. These include CCSNe
that don't harbor GRBs or any other relativistic outflows. Our findings suggest
a continuum of central engine activities in different types of CCSNe and call
for rethinking of the explosion mechanism of regular CCSNe

alpha's the scalar curvature does not drop to zero at the star surface (as in
General Relativity) but exponentially decreases with distance. Also the stellar
mass bounded by star surface decreases when the value alpha increases.
Nonetheless distant observers would observe a gravitational mass due to
appearance of a so-called gravitational sphere around the star. The non-zero
curvature contribution to the gravitational mass eventually is shown to
compensate the stellar mass decrease for growing alpha's. We perform our
analysis for several equations of state including purely hadronic
configurations as well as hyperons and quark stars. In all cases, we assess
that the relation between the parameter $\alpha$ and the gravitational mass
weakly depend upon the chosen equation of state. Another interesting feature is
the increase of the star radius in comparison to General Relativity for stars
with masses close to maximal, whereas for intermediate masses around 1.4-1.6
solar masses, the radius of star depends upon alpha very weakly. Also the
decrease in the mass bounded by star surface may cause the surface redshift to
decrease in R^2-gravity when compared to Einsteinian predictions. This effect
is shown to hardly depend upon the observed gravitational mass. Finally, for
negative values of alpha our analysis shows that outside the star the scalar
curvature has damped oscillations but the contribution of the gravitational
sphere into the gravitational mass increases indefinitely with radial distance
putting into question the very existence of such relativistic stars.

  Disease",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no
cure and limited treatment solutions that are unable to target any of the
suspected causes. Increasing evidence suggests that one of the causes of
neurodegeneration is the overproduction of amyloid beta (A\b{eta}) and the
inability of A\b{eta} peptides to be cleared from the brain, resulting in
self-aggregation to form toxic oligomers, fibrils and plaques. One of the
potential treatment options is to target A\b{eta} and prevent self-aggregation
to allow for a natural clearing of the brain. In this paper, we review the
drugs and drug delivery systems that target A\b{eta} in relation to Alzheimer's
disease. Many attempts have been made to use anti-A\b{eta} targeting molecules
capable of targeting A\b{eta} (with much success in vitro and in vivo animal
models), but the major obstacle to this technique is the challenge posed by the
blood brain barrier (BBB). This highly selective barrier protects the brain
from toxic molecules and pathogens and prevents the delivery of most drugs.
Therefore novel A\b{eta} aggregation inhibitor drugs will require well
thought-out drug delivery systems to deliver sufficient concentrations to the
brain.

hyperthermia cancer treatment, targeted drug delivery and for magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) as contrast enhancement agents. In order to understand
how SPIONs interact with cells and cellular membranes it would be of interest
to characterize individual SPIONs at the nanoscale in physiologically relevant

properties of bare and SiO2 coated SPIONs are compared using MFM. We report
that surface modification using (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane

To obtain proof of principle that SPIONS can be imaged with MFM inside the cell
we imaged SPIONs buried in thin polymer films (polystyrene (PS) and poly
methyl-methacrylate (PMMA)). This opens the possibility of visualizing SPIONs
inside the cell without any labeling or modifications and present MFM as a

dyshomeostasis of metal ions and their propensity to interact with A\b{eta} has
also been implicated in AD. In this work, we use single molecule atomic force
spectroscopy to measure the rupture force required to dissociate two A\b{eta}

atomic force microscopy to resolve the aggregation of A\b{eta} formed. Previous
research has shown that metal ions decrease the lag time associated with
A\b{eta} aggregation. We show that with the addition of copper ions the
unbinding force increases notably. This suggests that the reduction of lag time
associated with A\b{eta} aggregation occurs on a single molecule level as a
result of an increase in binding forces during the very initial interactions
between two A\b{eta} peptides. We attribute these results to copper ions acting
as a bridge between the two peptide molecules, increasing the stability of the

vertebrates. This facilitates stress adaptation and the mode of action involves
activation of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor leading to the
modulation of target gene expression. However, this genomic effect is slow
acting and, therefore, a role for glucocorticoid in the rapid response to
stress is unclear. Here we show that stress levels of cortisol, the primary
glucocorticoid in teleosts, rapidly fluidizes rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) liver plasma membranes in vitro. This involved incorporation of the
steroid into the lipid domains, as cortisol coupled to a membrane impermeable
peptide moiety, did not affect membrane order. Studies confirmed that cortisol,
but not sex steroids, increases liver plasma membrane fluidity. Atomic force
microscopy revealed cortisol mediated changes to membrane surface topography
and viscoelasticity confirming changes to membrane order. Treating trout
hepatocytes with stress levels of cortisol led to the modulation of cell
signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation status of putative PKA, PKC
and AKT substrate proteins within 10 minutes. The phosphorylation by protein
kinases in the presence of cortisol was consistent with that seen with benzyl
alcohol, a known membrane fluidizer. Our results suggest that biophysical
changes to plasma membrane properties, triggered by stressor induced
glucocorticoid elevation, act as a nonspecific stress response and may rapidly
modulate acute stress-signaling pathways.

large amplitude time-periodic shear flows, considering separately the protocols
of large amplitude oscillatory shear strain, large amplitude square or
triangular or sawtooth strain rate, and large amplitude oscillatory shear
stress. In each case, we find shear banding to be an important part of the
material's flow response for a broad range of values of the frequency $\omega$
and amplitude of the imposed oscillation. Crucially, and highly
counterintuitively, in the glass phase this persists even to the lowest
frequencies accessible numerically (that seems consistent with it persisting
even when $\omega\to 0$), although the soft glassy rheology model we use has an
underlying monotonic constitutive curve of shear stress as a function of shear
rate, and is therefore unable to support shear banding as its steady state
response at constant shear rate. We attribute this to the repeated competition,
within each flow cycle, of glassy aging and flow rejuvenation. Besides
reporting significant banding in the glass phase, where the flow curve has a
yield stress, we also observe it at noise temperatures just above the glass
point, where the flow curve is of power law fluid form. Thus, our results
suggest a predisposition to shear banding in flows of even extremely slow
time-variation, for both aging yield stress fluids, and for power law fluids
with sluggish relaxation timescales. We show that shear banding can have a
pronounced effect on the shape of the Lissajous-Bowditch curves that are
commonly used to fingerprint complex fluids rheologically. We therefore counsel
caution in seeking to compute such curves calculations that impose upfront a
homogeneous shear flow, discarding the possibility of banding. We also analyze
the stress response to the imposed strain waveforms in terms of a `sequence of
physical processes'.

  The corresponding fluctuations are also known: For every fixed

using axisymmetric numerical simulations. We modelled the propeller regime for
stars with realistically large magnetospheres (5-7 stellar radii), so that our
results could be applied to different types of magnetized stars, including
Classical T Tauri stars, cataclysmic variables, and accreting millisecond
pulsars. A wide range of propeller strengths has been studied, from very strong
propellers (where the magnetosphere rotates much more rapidly than the inner
disk) to very weak propellers (where the magnetosphere rotates only slightly
faster than the inner disc. In both propellers, matter is accumulated at the
inner disc for the majority of the time, while episodes of accretion onto the
star and ejection into the wind are relatively brief. The efficiency of the
propeller, which characterizes the part of inner disk matter flowing into the
wind, strongly depends on the fastness parameter omega_s: propeller efficiency
increases with omega_s. The properties of the winds are different in strong and
weak propellers. In the strong propellers, matter is accelerated rapidly above
the escape velocity and flows at a relatively small opening angle of 40-45
degrees. In the weak propellers, matter may flow faster or slower than the
escape velocity and at a large opening angle of 60-70 degrees. A star-disk
system loses energy and angular momentum. A part of the rotational energy of
the star is ejected to the magnetically-dominated (Poynting flux) jet, which is
only present in the strong propellers. The other part of the energy flows from
the inner disk into a propeller-driven wind. A star spins down partly due to
the flow of angular momentum from the star to the corona or to the Poynting
flux jet along the open field lines, and partly due to the flow of angular
momentum to the inner disk along the closed field lines.

function from a feature space to a semantic embedding space (e.g.~attribute
space). However, such a projection function is only concerned with predicting
the training seen class semantic representation (e.g.~attribute prediction) or
classification. When applied to test data, which in the context of ZSL contains
different (unseen) classes without training data, a ZSL model typically suffers
from the project domain shift problem. In this work, we present a novel
solution to ZSL based on learning a Semantic AutoEncoder (SAE). Taking the
encoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder aims to project a visual feature vector
into the semantic space as in the existing ZSL models. However, the decoder
exerts an additional constraint, that is, the projection/code must be able to
reconstruct the original visual feature. We show that with this additional
reconstruction constraint, the learned projection function from the seen
classes is able to generalise better to the new unseen classes. Importantly,
the encoder and decoder are linear and symmetric which enable us to develop an
extremely efficient learning algorithm. Extensive experiments on six benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAE outperforms significantly the
existing ZSL models with the additional benefit of lower computational cost.
Furthermore, when the SAE is applied to supervised clustering problem, it also
beats the state-of-the-art.

stage are received. \emph{Coflow} is a recently proposed networking abstraction
to capture such communication patterns. We consider the problem of efficiently
scheduling coflows with release dates in a shared datacenter network so as to
minimize the total weighted completion time of coflows.
  Several heuristics have been proposed recently to address this problem, as
well as a few polynomial-time approximation algorithms with provable
performance guarantees. Our main result in this paper is a polynomial-time
deterministic algorithm that improves the prior known results. Specifically, we
propose a deterministic algorithm with approximation ratio of $5$, which
improves the prior best known ratio of $12$. For the special case when all
coflows are released at time zero, our deterministic algorithm obtains
approximation ratio of $4$ which improves the prior best known ratio of $8$.
The key ingredient of our approach is an improved linear program formulation
for sorting the coflows followed by a simple list scheduling policy. Extensive
simulation results, using both synthetic and real traffic traces, are presented
that verify the performance of our algorithm and show improvement over the
prior approaches.

technique overcomes some of the cost limitations of turbulence simulation,
since the main flow is treated with a coarse-grid LES, with the equivalent of
wall functions supplied by the near-wall sampled QDNS. Two cases are tested, at
friction Reynolds number Re$_\tau$=4200 and 20,000. The total grid node count
for the first case is less than half a million and less than two million for
the second case, with the calculations only requiring a desktop computer. A
good agreement with published DNS is found at Re$_\tau$=4200, both in terms of
the mean velocity profile and the streamwise velocity fluctuation statistics,
which correctly show a substantial increase in near-wall turbulence levels due
to a modulation of near-wall streaks by large-scale structures. The trend
continues at Re$_\tau$=20,000, in agreement with experiment, which represents
one of the major achievements of the new approach. A number of detailed aspects
of the model, including numerical resolution, LES-QDNS coupling strategy and
sub-grid model are explored. A low level of grid sensitivity is demonstrated
for both the QDNS and LES aspects. Since the method does not assume a law of

by the connectivity structure of neuronal circuits. This study systematically
investigates the network and stimulus properties that shape network responses.
The results show how input to a cortical column model of the primary visual
cortex excites dynamical modes determined by the laminar pattern. Stimulating
the inhibitory neurons in the upper layer reproduces experimentally observed
resonances at gamma frequency whose origin can be traced back to two anatomical
sub-circuits. We develop this result systematically: Initially, we highlight
the effect of stimulus amplitude and filter properties of the neurons on their
response to oscillatory stimuli. Subsequently, we analyze the amplification of
oscillatory stimuli by the effective network structure. We demonstrate that the
amplification of stimuli, as well as their visibility in different populations,
can be explained by specific network patterns. Inspired by experimental results
we ask whether the anatomical origin of oscillations can be inferred by
applying oscillatory stimuli. We find that different network motifs can
generate similar responses to oscillatory input, showing that resonances in the
network response cannot, straightforwardly, be assigned to the motifs they
emerge from. Applying the analysis to a spiking model of a cortical column, we
characterize how the dynamic mode structure, which is induced by the laminar
connectivity, processes external input. In particular, we show that a stimulus
applied to specific populations typically elicits responses of several
interacting modes. The resulting network response is therefore composed of a
multitude of contributions and can therefore neither be assigned to a single
mode nor do the observed resonances necessarily coincide with the intrinsic
resonances of the circuit.

tensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories of gravity
allow for up to four additional vector and scalar modes. The detection of these
alternative polarizations would represent a clear violation of general
relativity. The LIGO-Virgo detection of the binary black hole merger GW170814
has recently offered the first direct constraints on the polarization of
gravitational waves. The current generation of ground-based detectors, however,
is limited in its ability to sensitively determine the polarization content of
transient gravitational-wave signals. Observation of the stochastic
gravitational-wave background, in contrast, offers a means of directly
measuring generic gravitational-wave polarizations. The stochastic background,
arising from the superposition of many individually unresolvable
gravitational-wave signals, may be detectable by Advanced LIGO at
design-sensitivity. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method with which to
detect and characterize the polarization of the stochastic background. We
explore prospects for estimating parameters of the background, and quantify the
limits that Advanced LIGO can place on vector and scalar polarizations in the
absence of a detection. Finally, we investigate how the introduction of new
terrestrial detectors like Advanced Virgo aid in our ability to detect or
constrain alternative polarizations in the stochastic background. We find that,

prospects, it may dramatically improve our ability to estimate the parameters

equation, where an array of sensors probes an unknown medium with pulses and
measures the scattered waves. The goal of the inversion is to determine from
these measurements the structure of the scattering medium, modeled by a
spatially varying acoustic impedance function. Many inversion algorithms assume
that the mapping from the unknown impedance to the scattered waves is
approximately linear. The linearization, known as the Born approximation, is
not accurate in strongly scattering media, where the waves undergo multiple
reflections before they reach the sensors in the array. Thus, the
reconstructions of the impedance have numerous artifacts. The main result of
the paper is a novel, linear-algebraic algorithm that uses a reduced order
model (ROM) to map the data to those corresponding to the single scattering
(Born) model. The ROM construction is based only on the measurements at the
sensors in the array. The ROM is a proxy for the wave propagator operator, that

commences once the resolved shear stress on a slip plane reaches a critical
value. This assumption, known as Schmid law, implies that the onset of
plasticity is independent of the normal stress acting on the slip plane. We
examine the validity of this assumption in single crystal perfect lattices at
zero temperature by subjecting them to a wide range of combined normal and
shear stresses and identifying the onset of plasticity. We employ phonon
stability analysis on four distinct single crystal metals and identify the
onset of plasticity with the onset of an instability. Our results show
significant dependence of yielding on the normal stress, thereby illustrating
the necessity of considering non-Schmid effects in crystal plasticity. Finally,
contrary to the common assumption that instabilities in single crystals are of
long wavelength type, we show that short wavelength instabilities are abundant
in the nucleation of defects for a wide range of loading conditions.

propose a novel Distributed Feature Selection Framework (DFSF) to conduct the

the learning process, we propose a family of distributed group Lasso screening
rules to identify irrelevant features and remove them from the optimization.
Then we select the relevant group features by performing the group Lasso
feature selection process in a sequence of parameters. Finally, we employ the
stability selection to rank the top risk SNPs that might help detect the early
stage of AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed
feature selection model integrated with group Lasso feature selection as well
as detecting the risk genetic factors across multiple research institutions
system. Empirical studies are conducted on 809 subjects with 5.9 million SNPs
which are distributed across several individual institutions, demonstrating the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

including reverse engineering of non-reversible functions embedded into
reversible circuits. We propose the number of embeddings of non-reversible
functions into a reversible circuit as the security metric for reverse
engineering. We analyze the security benefits of automatic synthesis of
reversible circuits. We use our proposed security metric to show that the
functional synthesis approaches yield reversible circuits that are more
resilient to reverse engineering than the structural synthesis approaches.
Finally, we propose scrambling of the inputs and outputs of a reversible
circuit to thwart reverse engineering.

queueing theory, with the main reason being tractability and computational
efficiency. This dissertation is concerned with establishing theoretical
guarantees on the performance of steady-state diffusion approximations of
queueing systems. We develop a modular framework based on Stein's method that
allows us to establish error bounds, or convergence rates, for the
approximations. We apply this framework three queueing systems: the Erlang-C,
Erlang-A, and $M/Ph/n+M$ systems.
  The former two systems are simpler and allow us to showcase the full
potential of the framework. Namely, we prove that both Wasserstein and
Kolmogorov distances between the stationary distribution of a normalized
customer count process, and that of an appropriately defined diffusion process
decrease at a rate of $1/\sqrt{R}$, where $R$ is the offered load. Futhermore,
these error bounds are \emph{universal}, valid in any load condition from
lightly loaded to heavily loaded. For the Erlang-C model, we also show that a
diffusion approximation with state-dependent diffusion coefficient can achieve
a rate of convergence of $1/R$, which is an order of magnitude faster when
compared to approximations with constant diffusion coefficients.

All living beings have a cellular structure, so it is not possible to have a
broader concept of life hence the search for extraterrestrial life is
restricted to extraterrestrial cells. Earth is an astronomical rarity because
it is difficult for a planet to present liquid water on the surface. Two
antagonistic bioethical principles arise: planetary protection and
terraforming. Planetary protection is based on the fear of interplanetary
cross-infection and possible ecological damages caused by alien living beings.
Terraforming is the intention of modifying the environmental conditions of the
neighbouring planets in such a way that human colonisation would be possible.
The synthesis of this antagonism is ecopoiesis, a concept related to the
creation of new ecosystems in other planets. Since all the multicellular
biodiversity requires oxygen to survive, only extremophile microorganisms could
survive in other planets. So, it could be carried out a simulation of a
meteorite by taking to other planets portions of the terrestrial permafrost, or
ocean or soil, so that if a single species could grow, a new ecosystem would
start, as well as a new Natural History. As a conclusion, ecopoiesis should be
the bioethical principle to guide practices and research in Astrobiology.

estimating the initial energy density once an initial time $\tau_0$ is
specified. However, it cannot be trusted at low energies, e.g. well below
$\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} \approx 50$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions, when
$\tau_0$ is smaller than the finite time it takes for the two nuclei to cross
each other. Here I extend the Bjorken formula by including the finite time
duration of the initial energy production. Analytical solutions for the formed
energy density in the central spacetime-rapidity region are derived for several
time profiles. Compared to the Bjorken formula at low energies, the maximum
energy density reached is much lower, increases much faster with the collision
energy, and is much less sensitive to the uncertainty of the formation time,
while the energy density time evolution is much longer. Comparisons with
results from a multi-phase transport confirm the key features of these
solutions. The effect of the finite longitudinal width of the initial energy
production, which is neglected in the analytical results, is investigated with
the transport model and shown to be small. This work thus provides a general
model for the initial energy production of relativistic heavy ion collisions

produce a context vector for each target word prediction. In practice, we find
that context vectors for different target words are quite similar to one
another and therefore are insufficient in discriminatively predicting target
words. The reason for this might be that context vectors produced by the
vanilla attention network are just a weighted sum of source representations
that are invariant to decoder states. In this paper, we propose a novel
GRU-gated attention model (GAtt) for NMT which enhances the degree of
discrimination of context vectors by enabling source representations to be
sensitive to the partial translation generated by the decoder. GAtt uses a
gated recurrent unit (GRU) to combine two types of information: treating a
source annotation vector originally produced by the bidirectional encoder as
the history state while the corresponding previous decoder state as the input
to the GRU. The GRU-combined information forms a new source annotation vector.
In this way, we can obtain translation-sensitive source representations which
are then feed into the attention network to generate discriminative context
vectors. We further propose a variant that regards a source annotation vector
as the current input while the previous decoder state as the history.
Experiments on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that both GAtt-based
models achieve significant improvements over the vanilla attentionbased NMT.
Further analyses on attention weights and context vectors demonstrate the
effectiveness of GAtt in improving the discrimination power of representations
and handling the challenging issue of over-translation.

drugs, toxicity, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. In various
types of chemical analyses, computational approaches are often required due to
the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable growth and
outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research
attention. However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep
learning continues to be used only as a classifier, although deep learning is
capable of not only simple classification but also automated feature
extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for
CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular
input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the
chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted features. To discover
hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous
interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging
techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep
classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI
showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition,
the commutative property was experimentally validated. The automatically
extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the
significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to
improve prediction performance, in drug analyses.

containing dust have been identified using space-based infrared observations
with the Herschel Space Telescope. The presence of large quantities of dust in
massive ETGs is peculiar as X-ray halos of these galaxies are expected to
destroy dust in 10 Myr (or less). This has sparked a debate regarding the
origin of the dust: is it internally produced by asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars, or is it accreted externally through mergers? We examine the 2D stellar
and ionised gas kinematics of dusty ETGs using IFS observations from the SAMI
galaxy survey, and integrated star-formation rates, stellar masses, and dust
masses from the GAMA survey. Only 8% (4/49) of visually-classified ETGs are
kinematically consistent with being dispersion-supported systems. These
""dispersion-dominated galaxies"" exhibit discrepancies between stellar and
ionised gas kinematics, either offsets in the kinematic position angle or large
differences in the rotational velocity, and are outliers in star-formation rate
at a fixed dust mass compared to normal star-forming galaxies. These properties
are suggestive of recent merger activity. The remaining 90% of dusty ETGs have
low velocity dispersions and/or large circular velocities, typical of
""rotation-dominated galaxies"". These results, along with the general evidence
of published works on X-ray emission in ETGs, suggest that they are unlikely to
host hot, X-ray gas consistent with their low stellar mass when compared to
dispersion-dominated galaxies. This means dust will be long lived and thus
these galaxies do not require external scenarios for the origin of their dust
content.

integral field spectroscopic surveys. In this paper we explore the emergence of
counter-rotation (both stellar and gaseous) in S0 galaxies from
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations of 1/10 mass ratio minor mergers
between a 10^10.8 solar mass disk galaxy with a bulge-to-total ration of 0.17
and a gas rich companion (gas-to-stellar mass fraction of 5.0). These
simulations include a self-consistent treatment of gas dynamics, star
formation, the production/destruction of H2 and dust, and the time evolution of
the interstellar radiation field. We explore the effect of retrograde versus
prograde obits, gas and bulge mass fractions of the primary galaxy, and orbital
parameters of the companion. The key requirement for producing counter rotation
in stars or gas in a merger remnant is a retrograde primary, while the relative
spin of the companion affects only the radial extent of the accreted gas. We
also find that including a significant amount of gas in the primary can prevent
the emergence of counter-rotating gas, although accreted stars retain
counter-rotation. Bulge mass and orbit have a secondary effect, generally
influencing the final distribution of accreted stars and gas within the
framework outlined above. In addition to our primary focus of counter-rotating
components in galaxies, we also make some predictions regarding the SFRs, H2
distributions, and dust in minor merger remnants.

By contrast, the relative-phase mode always possesses a gapped energy, undamped
in the spin-unpolarized phase but weakly damped in the spin-polarized phase. In
the spin-unpolarized phase, both modes are linearly polarized despite pumping
and decay. However, in the spin-polarized phase, the mode polarization can be
significantly affected by the reservoir and depends strongly on the circular
polarization degree of the condensate. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the
`ghost' branch of the Bogoliubov spectrum of the relative-phase mode can be
visualized in the photoluminescence emission, distinguishable from that of the
global-phase mode and thus allowing for experimental observation, when the
spinor polariton condensate is elliptically polarized.

step in forming stars. The bar-mode instability of spherically collapsing cores
found in previous linear analysis invokes a possibility of re-fragmentation of
the cores due to their ellipsoidal (prolate or oblate) deformation. To
investigate this possibility, here we perform three-dimensional
self-gravitational hydrodynamics simulations that follow all the way from
filament fragmentation to subsequent core collapse. We assume the gas is
polytropic with index \gamma, which determines the stability of the bar-mode.
For the case that the fragmentation of isolated hydrostatic filaments is
triggered by the most unstable fragmentation mode, we find the bar mode grows
as collapse proceeds if \gamma < 1.1, in agreement with the linear analysis.
However, it takes more than ten orders-of-magnitude increase in the central
density for the distortion to become non-linear. In addition to this fiducial
case, we also study non-fiducial ones such as the fragmentation is triggered by
a fragmentation mode with a longer wavelength and it occurs during radial
collapse of filaments and find the distortion rapidly grows. In most of
astrophysical applications, the effective polytropic index of collapsing gas
exceeds 1.1 before ten orders-of-magnitude increase in the central density.
Thus, supposing the fiducial case of filament fragmentation, re-fragmentation
of dense cores would not be likely and their final mass would be determined
when the filaments fragment.

Focussing on the case of a two-level system, we calculate microscopically the

OTOCs are immune to dephasing processes and some are not, such correlators may
decay on two sets of parametrically different time scales related to inelastic
transitions between the system levels and to pure dephasing processes,

that is truncated in the streamwise direction, artificial boundary conditions
may give rise to spurious pressure signals that are capable of providing
unwanted perturbation feedback to upstream locations. The manifestation of such
feedback in the eigenmode spectrum is analysed here for two simple
configurations. First, explicitly prescribed feedback in a Ginzburg-Landau
model is shown to produce a spurious eigenmode branch, named the 'arc branch',
that strongly resembles a characteristic family of eigenmodes typically present
in open shear flow calculations. Second, corresponding mode branches in the
global spectrum of an incompressible parallel jet in a truncated domain are
examined. It is demonstrated that these eigenmodes of the numerical model
depend on the presence of spurious forcing of a local k+ instability wave at
the inflow, caused by pressure signals that appear to be generated at the
outflow. Multiple local k+ branches result in multiple global eigenmode
branches. For the particular boundary treatment chosen here, the strength of
the pressure feedback from the outflow towards the inflow boundary is found to
decay with the cube of the numerical domain length. It is concluded that
arc-branch eigenmodes are artifacts of domain truncation, with limited value
for physical analysis. It is demonstrated, for the example of a non-parallel
jet, how spurious feedback may be reduced by an absorbing layer near the
outflow boundary.

functional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases
together with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at
low density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities
$\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang
functional, valid for $\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional
retained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional
corresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all
orders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One
conclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density
regime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with
respect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce
density--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare
interaction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some
of the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas
properties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that
the scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the
so-called Bertsch parameter $\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also
point out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those
empirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally
propose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate

ZrS2 NRs with armchair edges are all indirect-band-gap semiconductors without
magnetism and the band-gap exhibits odd-even oscillation behavior with the
increase of the ribbon width. For the NRs with zigzag edges, those with both
edges S-terminated are nonmagnetic direct-band-gap semiconductors and the gap
decreases monotonically as a function of the ribbon width. However, the NRs
with one edge S-terminated and the other edge Zr-terminated are ferromagnetic
half-metal, while those with both edges Zr-terminated tend to be ferromagnetic
half-metal when the width $N\geq9$. The magnetism of both systems mainly

many information systems, rankings are widely used to represent the preferences

problem of how to evaluate the degree to which the rankings agree. The
consensus measure can be used to evaluate rankings in many information systems,
as quite often there is not ground truth available for evaluation.
  This paper introduces a novel approach for consensus measure of rankings by
using graph representation, in which the vertices or nodes are the items and
the edges are the relationship of items in the rankings. Such representation
leads to various algorithms for consensus measure in terms of different aspects
of rankings, including the number of common patterns, the number of common
patterns with fixed length and the length of the longest common patterns. The
proposed measure can be adopted for various types of rankings, such as full

the proposed approaches can be used to evaluate the quality of rank aggregation

of vertices $u,v$ in a weighted undirected graph $G = (V,E,\omega)$ is the
length of the shortest $u-v$ path in $G$ with at most $\beta$ edges, aka {\em
hops}. For $\beta$ as above and $\epsilon>0$, a {\em $(\beta,\epsilon)$-hopset}
of $G = (V,E,\omega)$ is a graph $G' =(V,H,\omega_H)$ on the same vertex set,
such that all distances in $G$ are $(1+\epsilon)$-approximated by
$\beta$-bounded distances in $G\cup G'$.
  Hopsets are a fundamental graph-theoretic and graph-algorithmic construct,
and they are widely used for distance-related problems in a variety of
computational settings. Currently existing constructions of hopsets produce
hopsets either with $\Omega(n \log n)$ edges, or with a hopbound
$n^{\Omega(1)}$. In this paper we devise a construction of {\em linear-size}
hopsets with hopbound $(\log n)^{\log^{(3)}n+O(1)}$. This improves the previous
bound almost exponentially.
  We also devise efficient implementations of our construction in PRAM and
distributed settings. The only existing PRAM algorithm \cite{EN16} for
computing hopsets with a constant (i.e., independent of $n$) hopbound requires
$n^{\Omega(1)}$ time. We devise a PRAM algorithm with polylogarithmic running
time for computing hopsets with a constant hopbound, i.e., our running time is
exponentially better than the previous one. Moreover, these hopsets are also
significantly sparser than their counterparts from \cite{EN16}.
  We use our hopsets to devise a distributed routing scheme that exhibits
near-optimal tradeoff between individual memory requirement
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ of vertices throughout preprocessing and routing phases of
the algorithm, and stretch $O(k)$, along with a near-optimal construction time
$\approx D + n^{1/2 + 1/k}$, where $D$ is the hop-diameter of the input graph.

SpreadCluster learns the criteria of features from the versioned spreadsheets

SpreadCluster could cluster spreadsheets with higher precision and recall rate

energy harvesting. For this to become a reality, critical issues such as
reproducibility and sensitivity to defects should be resolved. By discussing
the optical properties of MBE grown GaAs nanomembranes we highlight several
features that bring them closer to large scale applications. Uncapped membranes
exhibit a very high optical quality, expressed by extremely narrow neutral
exciton emission, allowing the resolution of the more complex excitonic
structure for the first time. Capping of the membranes with an AlGaAs shell
results in a strong increase of emission intensity but also to a shift and
broadening of the exciton peak. This is attributed to the existence of
impurities in the shell, beyond MBE-grade quality, showing the high sensitivity
of these structures to the presence of impurities. Finally, emission properties
are identical at the sub-micron and sub-millimeter scale, demonstrating the
potential of these structures for large scale applications.

used in ${}^{14}$C dating. The emphasis is on the estimation of the transit
time between a sequence of archeological layers. Although a frequentist
estimation of the parameters is relatively simple, confidence intervals
constructions are not standard as the models are not regular. I argue that that
the Bayesian paradigm is a natural approach to these models. It is simple, and
gives immediate solutions to credible sets, with natural interpretation and
simple construction. Indeed it is the standard tool of ${}^{14}$C analysis.
However and necessarily, the Bayesian approach is based on technical
assumptions that may dominate the scientific conclusion in a hard to predict
way. I exemplify the discussion in two ways. Firstly, I simulate toy models.
Secondly, I analyze a particular data set from the Iron Age period in Tel
Rehov. These data are important to the debate on the absolute time of the Iron
Age I/IIA transition in the Levant, and in particular to the feasibility of the
Bible story about the United Monarchy of David and Solomon. Our conclusion is
that the data in question cannot resolve this debate.

services can be provided to each player and each player values every
combination of services differently. A publicly known cost function specifies
the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial
cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player
gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are
(economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging
(i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting,
combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing
dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task.
  We present the Potential Mechanism -- a combination of the VCG mechanism and
a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's
potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism
that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the
same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution
shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is
approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations,
symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with
general valuations.

  previously included an error in one of the main theorems",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Blind delegation protocols allow a client to delegate a computation to a
server so that the server learns nothing about the input to the computation
apart from its size. For the specific case of quantum computation we know that
blind delegation protocols can achieve information-theoretic security. In this
paper we prove, provided certain complexity-theoretic conjectures are true,
that the power of information-theoretically secure blind delegation protocols
for quantum computation (ITS-BQC protocols) is in a number of ways constrained.
In the first part of our paper we provide some indication that ITS-BQC
protocols for delegating $\sf BQP$ computations in which the client and the
server interact only classically are unlikely to exist. We first show that
having such a protocol with $O(n^d)$ bits of classical communication implies
that $\mathsf{BQP} \subset \mathsf{MA/O(n^d)}$. We conjecture that this
containment is unlikely by providing an oracle relative to which $\mathsf{BQP}
\not\subset \mathsf{MA/O(n^d)}$. We then show that if an ITS-BQC protocol
exists with polynomial classical communication and which allows the client to
delegate quantum sampling problems, then there exist non-uniform circuits of
size $2^{n - \mathsf{\Omega}(n/log(n))}$, making polynomially-sized queries to
an $\sf NP^{NP}$ oracle, for computing the permanent of an $n \times n$ matrix.
The second part of our paper concerns ITS-BQC protocols in which the client and
the server engage in one round of quantum communication and then exchange
polynomially many classical messages. First, we provide a complexity-theoretic
upper bound on the types of functions that could be delegated in such a
protocol, namely $\mathsf{QCMA/qpoly \cap coQCMA/qpoly}$. Then, we show that
having such a protocol for delegating $\mathsf{NP}$-hard functions implies
$\mathsf{coNP^{NP^{NP}}} \subseteq \mathsf{NP^{NP^{PromiseQMA}}}$.

line, that is one of the best tracers of the disk conditions. We obtained
optical broadband medium resolution spectra from a dedicated campaign with the
Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Southern African Large Telescope in
2014-2015. Data span over one entire binary orbit, and cover both X-ray
quiescent and moderately active periods. We used Balmer emission lines to
follow the evolution of the circumstellar disk. We observe prominent spectral
features, like double-peaked H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. The
H$\alpha$ V/R ratio significantly changes over a time scale of about one year.
Our observations are consistent with a system observed at a large inclination
angle ($i\gtrsim60^{\circ}$). The derived circumstellar disk size shows that
the disk evolves from a configuration that prevents accretion onto the neutron
star, to one that allows only moderate accretion. This is in agreement with the
contemporary observed X-ray activity. Our results are interpreted within the
context of inefficient tidal truncation of the circumstellar disk, as expected
for this source's binary configuration. We derived the H$\beta$-emitting region
size, which results about half of the corresponding H$\alpha$-emitting disk,

science theme ""The Hot and Energetic Universe"", coupling a high-performance
X-ray Telescope with two complementary focal-plane instruments. One of these,
the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is a TES based kilo-pixel array providing
spatially resolved high-resolution spectroscopy (2.5 eV at 6 keV) over a 5
arcmin FoV. The background for this kind of detectors accounts for several
components: the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background, the low energy particles
(<~100 keV) focalized by the mirrors and reaching the detector from inside the
field of view, and the high energy particles (>~100 MeV) crossing the
spacecraft and reaching the focal plane from every direction. Each one of these
components is under study to reduce their impact on the instrumental
performances. This task is particularly challenging, given the lack of data on
the background of X-ray detectors in L2, the uncertainties on the particle
environment to be expected in such orbit, and the reliability of the models
used in the Monte Carlo background computations. As a consequence, the
activities addressed by the group range from the reanalysis of the data of
previous missions like XMM-Newton, to the characterization of the L2
environment by data analysis of the particle monitors onboard of satellites
present in the Earth magnetotail, to the characterization of solar events and
their occurrence, and to the validation of the physical models involved in the
Monte Carlo simulations. All these activities will allow to develop a set of
reliable simulations to predict, analyze and find effective solutions to reduce
the particle background experienced by the X-IFU, ultimately satisfying the
scientific requirement that enables the science of ATHENA. While the activities
are still ongoing, we present here some preliminary results already obtained by
the group.

zincblende and wurtzite modifications using a ten-band k.p model. In the
wurtzite phase, two energetically close conduction bands are of importance for
the confinement and the energy levels of the electron ground state. These bands
form two intersecting potential landscapes for electrons in zincblende/wurtzite
nanostructures. The energy difference between the two bands depends sensitively
on strain, such that even small strains can reverse the energy ordering of the
two bands. This reversal may already be induced by the non-negligible lattice
mismatch between the two crystal phases in polytype GaAs nanostructures, a fact
that was ignored in previous studies of these structures. We present a
systematic study of the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic strain on the
electron ground state for both purely zincblende and wurtzite nanowires as well
as for polytype superlattices. The coexistence of the two conduction bands and
their opposite strain dependence results in complex electronic and optical
properties of GaAs polytype nanostructures. In particular, both the energy and
the polarization of the lowest intersubband transition depends on the relative
fraction of the two crystal phases in the nanowire.

software development, having replaced emails in some cases. Chat messages
contain information about discussed issues, considered alternatives and
argumentation leading to the decisions made during software development. These
elements, defined as rationale, are invaluable during software evolution for
documenting and reusing development knowledge. Rationale is also essential for
coping with changes and for effective maintenance of the software system.
However, exploiting the rationale hidden in the chat messages is challenging
due to the high volume of unstructured messages covering a wide range of
topics. This work presents the results of an exploratory study examining the
frequency of rationale in chat messages, the completeness of the available
rationale and the potential of automatic techniques for rationale extraction.
For this purpose, we apply content analysis and machine learning techniques on
more than 8,700 chat messages from three software development projects. Our
results show that chat messages are a rich source of rationale and that machine
learning is a promising technique for detecting rationale and identifying
different rationale elements.

in the chiral SU(3) quark model which has successfully been employed to explain
the $N-N$ scattering data and the binding energy of deuteron. The binding
behavior of such a six quark system is solved by using a variational method.
The trial wave function is chosen to be a combination of a basic spherical
symmetric component of $[(0s)^6]_{orb}$ in the orbital space with
$0\hbar\omega$ excitation and an inner structural deformation component of
$[(0s)^5(1s)]_{orb}$ and $[(0s)^4(0p)^2]_{orb}$ in the orbital space with
$2\hbar\omega$ excitation, both of which are in the spatial [6] symmetry. It is
shown that the mass of the system is about $2356$ MeV, which is qualitative
consistent with the result both from the two-cluster configuration calculation
and from the data measured by the WASA Collaborations. This result tells us
that as long as the medium-range interaction due to the chiral symmetry
consideration is properly introduced, the mass of system will be reduced in a
rather large extent. It also implies that the observed $d^*$ is a six-quark
bound state with respect to the $\Delta\Delta$ threshold, which again supports
the conclusion that $d^*$ is a hexaquark dominant state.

RI spectrograms and LPS), is equivalent to simultaneously optimizing two
commonly used objective metrics: segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) and
logspectral distortion (LSD). Therefore, the learning process is called
multi-metrics learning (MML). Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
the proposed CNN with RI spectrograms and MML in terms of improved standardized
evaluation metrics on a speech enhancement task.

problems. In a weighted integer covering problem, the goal is to determine a
non-negative integer solution $x$ to system $\{ Ax \geq r \}$ minimizing a
non-negative cost function $c^T x$ (of appropriate dimensions). All
coefficients in matrix $A$ are assumed to be non-negative. We analyze the
performance of a very simple primal-dual greedy algorithm and discuss
conditions of system $(A,r)$ that guarantee feasibility of the constructed
solutions, and a bounded approximation factor. We call system $(A,r)$ a
\emph{greedy system} if it satisfies certain properties introduced in this
work. These properties highly rely on monotonicity and supermodularity
conditions on $A$ and $r$, and can thus be seen as a far reaching
generalization of contra-polymatroids. Given a greedy system $(A,r)$, we
carefully construct a truncated system $(A',r)$ containing the same integer
feasible points. We show that our primal-dual greedy algorithm when applied to
the truncated system $(A',r)$ obtains a feasible solution to $(A,r)$ with
approximation factor at most $2\delta + 1$, or $2\delta$ if $r$ is
non-negative. Here, $\delta$ is some characteristic of the truncated matrix
$A'$ which is small in many applications. The analysis is shown to be tight up
to constant factors. We also provide an approximation factor of $k (\delta +
1)$ if the greedy algorithm is applied to the intersection of multiple greedy
systems. The parameter $k$ is always bounded by the number of greedy systems
but may be much smaller. Again, we show that the dependency on $k$ is tight. We
conclude this paper with an exposition of classical approximation results based
on primal-dual algorithms that are covered by our framework. We match all of
the known results. Additionally, we provide some new insight in a
generalization of the flow cover on a line problem.

observed static stripes, but rather that the signals originate from different

may be entirely different phases, where the static stripes in one phase are

where vibration levels can be very high. To reduce vibrations, rotors usually
undergo a mass balancing process, where the machine is rotated at its full
speed range, during which the dynamic response near critical speeds can be
measured. High sensitivity, which is required for a successful balancing
process, is achieved near the critical speeds, where a single deflection mode
shape becomes dominant, and is excited by the projection of the imbalance on
it. The requirement to rotate the machine at high speeds is an obstacle in many
cases, where it is impossible to perform measurements at high speeds, due to
harsh conditions such as high temperatures and inaccessibility (e.g., jet
engines). $\\$ This paper proposes a novel balancing method of flexible rotors,
which does not require the machine to be rotated at high speeds. With this
method, the rotor is spun at low speeds, while subjecting it to a set of
externally controlled forces. The external forces comprise a set of tuned,
response dependent, parametric excitations, and nonlinear stiffness terms. The
parametric excitation can isolate any desired mode, while keeping the response
directly linked to the imbalance. A software controlled nonlinear stiffness
term limits the response, hence preventing the rotor to become unstable. These
forces warrant sufficient sensitivity required to detect the projection of the
imbalance on any desired mode without rotating the machine at high speeds.
Analytical, numerical and experimental results are shown to validate and
demonstrate the method.

drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) is proposed. We show that similarly as in
the DPS, the chains of type I bursts can be generated by the fragmented
magnetic reconnection associated with plasmoids interactions. To support this
new model of chains of type I bursts, we present an effect of merging of two
plasmoids to one larger plasmoid on the radio spectrum of DPS. This process can
also explain the ""wavy"" appearance of some chains of type I bursts. Then we
show that the chains of type I bursts with the ""wavy"" appearance can be used
for estimation of the magnetic field strength in their sources. We think that
differences of chains of type I bursts and DPSs are mainly owing to different
regimes of the magnetic field reconnection. While in the case of chains of type
I bursts the magnetic reconnection and plasmoid interactions are in the
quasi-separatrix layer of the active region in more or less quasi-saturated
regime, in the case of DPSs, observed in the impulsive phase of eruptive
flares, the magnetic reconnection and plasmoids interactions are in the current
sheet formed under the flare magnetic rope, which moves upwards and forces this

in the Internet and adopted in the industry. It, however, does not impose any
adaptation logic for selecting the quality of video fragments requested by
clients and suffers from lackluster performance with respect to a number of
desirable properties: efficiency, stability, and fairness when multiple players
compete for a bottleneck link. In this paper, we propose a throughput-friendly
DASH (TFDASH) rate control scheme for video streaming with multiple clients
over DASH to well balance the trade-offs among efficiency, stability, and
fairness. The core idea behind guaranteeing fairness and high efficiency
(bandwidth utilization) is to avoid OFF periods during the downloading process
for all clients, i.e., the bandwidth is in perfect-subscription or
over-subscription with bandwidth utilization approach to 100\%. We also propose
a dual-threshold buffer model to solve the instability problem caused by the
above idea. As a result, by integrating these novel components, we also propose
a probability-driven rate adaption logic taking into account several key
factors that most influence visual quality, including buffer occupancy, video
playback quality, video bit-rate switching frequency and amplitude, to
guarantee high-quality video streaming. Our experiments evidently demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed method.

result is that Short Generalized Hex is W[1]-complete parameterized by the

influential list of open problems from 1999. Previously, the problem was
thought of as a natural candidate for AW[*]-completeness. Our main tool is a
new fragment of first-order logic where universally quantified variables only
occur in inequalities. We show that model-checking on arbitrary relational
structures for a formula in this fragment is W[1]-complete when parameterized
by formula size. We also consider a general framework where a positional game
is represented as a hypergraph and two players alternately pick vertices. In a
Maker-Maker game, the first player to have picked all the vertices of some
hyperedge wins the game. In a Maker-Breaker game, the first player wins if she
picks all the vertices of some hyperedge, and the second player wins otherwise.
In an Enforcer-Avoider game, the first player wins if the second player picks
all the vertices of some hyperedge, and the second player wins otherwise. Short
Maker-Maker is AW[*]-complete, whereas Short Maker-Breaker is W[1]-complete and
Short Enforcer-Avoider co-W[1]-complete parameterized by the number of moves.
This suggests a rough parameterized complexity categorization into positional
games that are complete for the first level of the W-hierarchy when the winning
configurations only depend on which vertices one player has been able to pick,
but AW[*]-completeness when the winning condition depends on which vertices
both players have picked. However, some positional games where the board and
the winning configurations are highly structured are fixed-parameter tractable.
We give another example of such a game, Short k-Connect, which is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of moves.

approximately perpendicular to the famous 'integral filament' in the densest
regions of that filament. Furthermore, we see an 'hour-glass' magnetic field
morphology extending beyond the densest region of the integral filament into
the less-dense surrounding material, and discuss possible causes for this. We
also discuss the more complex morphology seen along the Orion Bar region. We
examine the morphology of the field along the lower-density north-eastern

magnetic fields lying parallel to low-density, non-self-gravitating filaments,

datasets have created the need to develop tools to reduce, approximate, and
classify large and multimodal data such as higher-order tensors. While early
approaches focused on matrix and vector based methods to represent these
higher-order data, more recently it has been shown that tensor decomposition
methods are better equipped to capture couplings across their different modes.
For these reasons, tensor decomposition methods have found applications in many
different signal processing problems including dimensionality reduction, signal
separation, linear regression, feature extraction, and classification. However,
most of the existing tensor decomposition methods are based on the principle of
finding a low-rank approximation in a linear subspace structure, where the
definition of the rank may change depending on the particular decomposition.
Since many datasets are not necessarily low-rank in a linear subspace, this
often results in high approximation errors or low compression rates. In this
paper, we introduce a new adaptive, multi-scale tensor decomposition method for
higher order data inspired by hybrid linear modeling and subspace clustering
techniques. In particular, we develop a multi-scale higher-order singular value
decomposition (MS-HoSVD) approach where a given tensor is first permuted and
then partitioned into several sub-tensors each of which can be represented as a
low-rank tensor with increased representational efficiency. The proposed
approach is evaluated for dimensionality reduction and classification for
several different real-life tensor signals with promising results.

at one blowup point $a$, according to the following asymptotic dynamics:
\begin{eqnarray*} u(x,t) \sim \psi(t) \left(1 + \frac{(p-1)|x-a|^2}{4p(T

the stability of the constructed solution with respect to perturbations in

algorithms have been proposed over the years, targeting different update types

a new dynamic algorithm for updating betweenness centrality after an edge
insertion or an edge weight decrease. Our method is a combination of two
independent contributions: a faster algorithm for updating pairwise distances
as well as number of shortest paths, and a faster algorithm for updating
dependencies. Whereas the worst-case running time of our algorithm is the same

We find that the addition of the power- and signal-recycling cavities shapes
the interferometer response to mechanical modes, resulting in up to four times
as many peaks. Changes to the accumulated phase or Gouy phase in the
signal-recycling cavity have a significant impact on the parametric gain, and
therefore which modes require suppression.

consisting of several thermocouples connected in series (thermopile), has been
developed. The goal of this method is to increase the accuracy of small
temperature difference measurements ($\Delta T \leq 1\:\textrm{K}$), without
invoking higher sensor complexity. To this end, a method to determine the
optimal temperature difference employed during the differential measurement of
thermoelectric sensitivities has been developed. This calibration temperature
difference is found at the minimum of combined measurement and linearization
error for a given mean temperature. The developed procedure is demonstrated in
an illustrative example calibration of a nine-junction thermopile. For mean
temperatures between $-10\:^{o}\textrm{C}$ and $15\:^{o}\textrm{C}$, the
thermoelectric sensitivity was measured with an uncertainty of less than $\pm
2\:\%$. Subsequently, temperature differences as low as $10^{-2}\:\textrm{K}$
can be resolved, while the thermometer used for the example calibration was
accurate only to $\pm 0.3\:\textrm{K}$. This and higher degrees of accuracy are
required in certain research applications, for example to detect heat flux
modulations in bifurcating fluidic systems.

graph with this feature. We herein investigate a variant of the simple
preferential attachment model, whose modifications are interesting for two main
reasons: to analyze more realistic models and to study the robustness of the
scale free behavior of the degree distribution. We introduce and study a model
which takes into account two different attachment rules: a preferential
attachment mechanism (with probability 1-p) that stresses the rich get richer
system, and a uniform choice (with probability p) for the most recent nodes.
The latter highlights a trend to select one of the last added nodes when no
information is available. The recent nodes can be either a given fixed number
or a proportion (\alpha n) of the total number of existing nodes. In the first
case, we prove that this model exhibits an asymptotically power-law degree
distribution. The same result is then illustrated through simulations in the
second case. When the window of recent nodes has constant size, we herein prove
that the presence of the uniform rule delays the starting time from which the
asymptotic regime starts to hold. The mean number of nodes of degree k and the
asymptotic degree distribution are also determined analytically. Finally, a
sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the model is performed.

  ""Context-aware Crowd-sensing in Opportunistic Mobile Social Network""",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, there have been efforts to collect human contact traces
during social events (e.g., conferences) using Bluetooth devices (e.g., mobile
phones, iMotes). The results of these studies have enabled the ability to do
the crowd-sourcing task from within the crowd, in order to answer questions,
such as: what is the current density of the crowd, or how many people are
attending the event? However, in those studies, the sensing devices are usually
distributed and configured in a certain manner. For example, the number of
devices is fixed, people register for the devices on a volunteering basis. In
this paper, we treat the above problem as an optimization problem and draw the
connection to the vertex cover problem in graph theory. Since finding the
optimal solution for minimum vertex cover problem is NP-complete, approximation
algorithms have to be used. However, we will show that the well-known
approximation algorithms do not perform well with the crowd-sensing task. In
this paper, we propose the notions of node observability and coverage utility
score and design a new context-aware approximation algorithm to find vertex
cover that is tailored for crowd-sensing task. In addition, we design
human-centric bootstrapping strategies to make initial assignment of sensing
devices based on meta information about the participants (e.g., interests,
friendship). The motivation is to assign the sensing task to a more
""socialized"" device to obtain better sensing coverage. We perform comprehensive
experiments on real-world data traces obtained from previous experimental
studies in conference and academic social context. The results show that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline approximation
algorithms in terms of sensing coverage.

algorithm, the so-called irregular-MF-DXA, to deal with irregular data

function of a gravitational wave background, a new cross-correlation function,
$\bar{\sigma}_{\times}$, derived from irregular-MF-DXA will be introduced. We
show that, this measure reveals the quadrupolar signature in the $PTRs$ induced

fluctuation functions, the generalized Hurst exponent, and the width of the
singularity spectrum to determine the dimensionless amplitude and power-law
exponent of the characteristic strain spectrum as
$\mathcal{H}_c(f)\sim\mathcal{A}_{yr}(f/f_{yr})^{\zeta}$ for stochastic GWB.
Using the value of Hurst exponent, one can clarify the type of GWs. We apply
our pipeline to explore 20 millisecond pulsars observed by Parkes Pulsar Timing
Array. The computed scaling exponents confirm that all data are classified into
a nonstationary class implying the universality feature. The value of the Hurst
exponent is in the range $H\in [0.56,0.87]$. The $q$-dependency of the
generalized Hurst exponent demonstrates that the observed $PTRs$ have
multifractal behavior, and the source of this multifractality is mainly
attributed to the correlation of data which is another universality of the
observed datasets. Multifractal analysis of available $PTRs$ datasets reveals
an upper bound on the dimensionless amplitude of the GWB, $\mathcal{A}_{yr}<
2.0\times 10^{-15}$.

what subsequent actions the multicopter should take, by taking account of
real-time information from guidance, attitude control, diagnosis, and other
low-level subsystems. In order to design a failsafe mechanism for multicopters,
safety issues of multicopters are introduced. Then, user requirements including
functional requirements and safety requirements are textually described, where
function requirements determine a general multicopter plant, and safety
requirements cover the failsafe measures dealing with the presented safety
issues. In order to model the user requirements by discrete-event systems,
several multicopter modes and events are defined. On this basis, the
multicopter plant and control specifications are modeled by automata. Then, a
supervisor is synthesized by monolithic supervisory control theory. In
addition, we present three examples to demonstrate the potential blocking
phenomenon due to inappropriate design of control specifications. Also, we
discuss the meaning of correctness and the properties of the obtained
supervisor. This makes the failsafe mechanism convincingly correct and
effective. Finally, based on the obtained supervisory controller generated by
TCT software, an implementation method suitable for multicopters is presented,
in which the supervisory controller is transformed into decision-making codes.

order to study non-linear effects in the generation of solitons by wind. A
linear stability analysis of the basic flow is made and the conditions at which
solitons first begin to grow is determined. Then, following [10], the
non-linear stability of the flow is examined and the quintic non-linear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation is derived for the amplitude of disturbances. The
coefficients of the non-linear Schr\""odinger equation are calculated from the
eigenvalue problem which determines the stability of air-water interface. An
asymptotic and a numerical stability analysis is carried out to determine the
neutrally stable flow conditions for air-sea interface. Four different profiles
are considered for the airflow blowing over the surface of the sea, namely,
plane Couette flow (pCf), plane Poiseuille flow (pPf), laminar and turbulent
boundary layer (L,TBL) profiles. For each of the above cases the shear flow
counterpart in the water is assumed to be a pPf. It is shown that the above
amplitude equation produces `snake' solitons [9] for pCf, pPf and LBL profiles,
with striking similarities. On the other hand, for TBL we observe a very
violent surface motion. For cases of pCf and LBL remarkable similarity is
observed with observations made at sea. We conclude that the effect of
nonlinearity in the airflow over the sea surface is much larger than nonlinear
interactions in the water, and hence it is not possible to decouple the motion
in the air and the water for finite amplitude wind-wave interactions,
particularly in the case of wind-generated solitons in shallow waters.

usually associated with either the inner viscous region or the outer boundary
layer region. It has been a long-held view that complete similarity of the
velocity profile can only occur if the inner and outer region scaling
parameters change proportionally as one moves from station to station along the
wall. However, it appears that complete similarity is not possible for the
wall-bounded turbulent boundary layer. Hence, the outer/inner ratio would seem
to be of little use. However, recent revelations revive the need for
identifying likely experimental datasets that display outer region similarity.
It is our contention that likely datasets can be identified by finding datasets
in which the inner-outer thickness ratio is almost constant. This inner-outer
thickness ratio is usually associated with the Rotta scaling ratio.
Unfortunately, the Rotta ratio proportional change condition has never been
shown to be a similarity requirement. In contrast, we show that a recently
developed thickness ratio based on the integral moment method must change
proportionately from station to station if similarity is present.
