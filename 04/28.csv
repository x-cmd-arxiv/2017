in the shearing-box approximation with no imposed net magnetic flux. Consistent
with recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect
ratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the
direction normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial
direction). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is
possible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To
explain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a
long box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most
efficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a
result, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal
(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the
turbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux
spreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the
turbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are
permeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the
instability. In agreement with this picture, the cases when the dynamo is
efficient are characterized by a strong intermittency of the local azimuthal
magnetic fluxes.

during the whole matter era, namely from redshifts $z\sim3000$ up to

$w_U=-1/3$, which marks the onset of acceleration, at around $z\sim0.5$. At
present times it acquires the value $w_U=-0.7$. Finally, it tends toward a
de-Sitter phase in the far future. This behaviour is in excellent agreement

Here, we quantify the fluctuations of the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission
using visibility data for two of the fields observed by the TIFR GMRT Sky
Survey (TGSS). We have used the 2D Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) to estimate
the angular power spectrum $(C_{\ell})$ from the visibilities. We find that the
sky signal, after subtracting the point sources, is likely dominated by the
diffuse Galactic synchrotron radiation across the angular multipole range $240
\le \ell \lesssim 500$. We present a power law fit,
$C_{\ell}=A\times\big(\frac{1000}{l}\big)^{\beta}$, to the measured $C_{\ell}$
over this $\ell$ range. We find that $(A,\beta)$ have values $(356\pm109~{\rm

the second field, however, there is indication of a significant residual point
source contribution, and for this field we interpret the measured $C_{\ell}$ as
an upper limit for the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission. While in both
fields the slopes are consistent with earlier measurements, the second field
appears to have an amplitude which is considerably smaller compared to similar

standard sources and boson stars. We consider spherically symmetric boson stars
within two classes of scalar self-interactions: an
effective-field-theoretically motivated quartic potential and a solitonic
potential constructed to produce very compact stars. We compute the tidal
deformability parameter characterizing the dominant tidal imprint in the
gravitational-wave signals for a large span of the parameter space of each
boson star model. We find that the tidal deformability for boson stars with a
quartic self-interaction is bounded below by $\Lambda_{\rm min}\approx 280$ and
for those with a solitonic interaction by $\Lambda_{\rm min}\approx 1.3$.
Employing a Fisher matrix analysis, we estimate the precision with which
Advanced LIGO and third-generation detectors can measure these tidal parameters
using the inspiral portion of the signal. We discuss a new strategy to improve
the distinguishability between black holes/neutrons stars and boson stars by
combining deformability measurements of each compact object in a binary system,
thereby eliminating the scaling ambiguities in each boson star model. Our
analysis shows that current-generation detectors can potentially distinguish
boson stars with quartic potentials from black holes, as well as from
neutron-star binaries if they have either a large total mass or a large mass
ratio. Discriminating solitonic boson stars from black holes using only tidal
effects during the inspiral will be difficult with Advanced LIGO, but
third-generation detectors should be able to distinguish between binary black
holes and these binary boson stars.

Analytical results are often not available or can only be obtained under strong
conditions, limiting their applicability. Also, numerical results have mostly
been obtained by ad-hoc Monte--Carlo simulations, which are usually
computationally expensive when a high degree of accuracy is needed. To gain
quantitative insight into these systems under general conditions, we here
introduce a numerical iterated first-passage time approach based on solving the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) to describe the statistics of
non-renewal stochastic systems. We illustrate the approach using
spike-triggered neuronal adaptation in the leaky and perfect integrate-and-fire
model, respectively. The transition to stationarity of first-passage time
moments and their sequential correlations occur on a non-trivial timescale that
depends on all system parameters. Surprisingly this is so for both single
exponential and scale-free power-law adaptation. The method works beyond the
small noise and timescale separation approximations. It shows excellent
agreement with direct Monte Carlo simulations, which allows for the computation
of transient and stationary distributions. We compare different methods to
compute the evolution of the moments and serial correlation coefficients (SCC),
and discuss the challenge of reliably computing the SCC which we find to be
very sensitive to numerical inaccuracies for both the leaky and perfect
integrate-and-fire models. In conclusion, our methods provide a general picture
of non-renewal dynamics in a wide range of stochastic systems exhibiting short
and long-range correlations.

the question of how best to design, verify, and optimise protocols that use
lattice surgery, in particular in architectures with complex resource

match exactly the operations of lattice surgery. Red and green ""spider"" nodes
match rough and smooth merges and splits, and follow the axioms of a dagger
special associative Frobenius algebra. Some lattice surgery operations require
non-trivial correction operations, which are captured natively in the use of
the ZX calculus in the form of ensembles of diagrams. We give a first taste of
the power of the calculus as a language for lattice surgery by considering two

so-called spreading width to the natural width of the transmission line. In
particular, we find that the established transmission disappears sharply when
this ratio exceeds unity. The approach exemplifies the role of the chaotic
background in dephasing the deterministic scattering.

conjecture, stating that there exist arbitrarily small perturbations to AdS
initial data which, under evolution by the Einstein vacuum equations for
$\Lambda<0$ with reflecting boundary conditions on conformal infinity, lead to
the formation of black holes. The numerical study of this conjecture in the
simpler setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein--scalar field system was
initiated by Bizon and Rostworowski, followed by a vast number of numerical and
heuristic works by several authors.
  In this paper, we provide the first rigorous proof of the AdS instability
conjecture in the simplest possible setting, namely for the spherically
symmetric Einstein--massless Vlasov system, in the case when the Vlasov field
is moreover supported only on radial geodesics. This system is equivalent to
the Einstein--null dust system, allowing for both ingoing and outgoing dust. In
order to overcome the break down of this system occuring once the null dust
reaches the centre $r=0$, we place an inner mirror at $r=r_{0}>0$ and study the
evolution of this system on the exterior domain $\{r\ge r_{0}\}$. The structure
of the maximal development and the Cauchy stability properties of general
initial data in this setting are studied in our companion paper.
  The statement of the main theorem is as follows: We construct a family of
mirror radii $r_{0\epsilon}>0$ and initial data $\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}$,
$\epsilon\in(0,1]$, converging to the AdS initial data in a suitable norm, such
that, for any $\epsilon>0$, the maximal development
$(\mathcal{M}_{\epsilon},g_{\epsilon})$ of $\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}$ contains a
black hole region. Our proof is based on purely physical space arguments.

analytical framework and show that under certain dual conditions, the optimal
solution of the matrix factorization program is the same as its bi-dual and
thus the global optimality of the non-convex program can be achieved by solving
its bi-dual which is convex. These dual conditions are satisfied by a wide
class of matrix factorization problems, although matrix factorization problems
are hard to solve in full generality. This analytical framework may be of
independent interest to non-convex optimization more broadly.
  We apply our framework to two prototypical matrix factorization problems:
matrix completion and robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These are
examples of efficiently recovering a hidden matrix given limited reliable
observations of it. Our framework shows that exact recoverability and strong
duality hold with nearly-optimal sample complexity guarantees for matrix

we highlight this fact by showing that, at the first point where the ingoing
dust reaches the axis of symmetry, solutions become $C^{0}$ inextendible,
although the spacetime metric remains regular up to that point.
  One way to overcome this trivial obstacle to well-posedness is to place an
inner mirror on a timelike hypersurface of the form $\{r=r_{0}\}$, $r_{0}>0$,
and study the evolution on the exterior domain $\{r\ge r_{0}\}$. In this
setting, we prove the existence and uniqueness of maximal developments for
general smooth and asymptotically AdS initial data sets, and study the basic
geometric properties of these developments. Furthermore, we establish the
well-posedness and Cauchy stabilty of solutions with respect to a rough initial
data norm, measuring the concentration of energy at scales proportional to the
mirror radius $r_{0}$.
  The above well-posedness and Cauchy stability estimates are used in our

stellar envelope but does not completely unbind it, producing a non-hydrostatic

different outcomes: (1) a stable NS, (2) a black hole (BH), or (3) a
supra-massive, rotationally-supported NS, which then collapses to a BH
following angular momentum losses. Which of these fates occur and in what
proportion has important implications for the electromagnetic transient
associated with the mergers and the expected gravitational wave signatures,
which in turn depend on the high density equation of state (EOS). Here we
combine relativistic calculations of NS masses using realistic EOSs with Monte
Carlo population synthesis based on the mass distribution of NS binaries in our
Galaxy to predict the distribution of fates expected. For many EOSs, a
significant fraction of the remnants are NSs or supra-massive NSs. This lends
support to scenarios where a quickly spinning, highly magnetized NS may be
powering an electromagnetic transient. This also indicates that it will be
important for future gravitational wave (GW) observatories to focus on high
frequencies to study the post merger GW emission. Even in cases where
individual GW events are too low in signal to noise to study the post merger
signature in detail, the statistics of how many mergers produce NSs versus BHs
can be compared with our work to constrain the EOS. To match short gamma-ray
burst (SGRB) X-ray afterglow statistics, we find that the stiffest EOSs are
ruled out. Furthermore, many popular EOSs require ~60-70% of SGRBs to be from
NS-BH mergers rather than just binary NSs.

to derive the stellar and wind parameters of massive stars. Although they have
become a powerful tool and sufficiently reproduce the observed spectral
appearance, they can hardly be used for more than measuring parameters. One
major obstacle is their inconsistency between the calculated radiation field
and the wind stratification due to the usage of prescribed mass-loss rates and
wind-velocity fields. AIMS: We present the concepts for a new generation of
hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE)
stellar atmosphere models that allow for detailed studies of radiation-driven
stellar winds. As a first demonstration, this new kind of model is applied to a
massive O star. METHODS: Based on earlier works, the PoWR code has been
extended with the option to consistently solve the hydrodynamic equation
together with the statistical equations and the radiative transfer in order to
obtain a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere stratification. In these
models, the whole velocity field is iteratively updated together with an
adjustment of the mass-loss rate. RESULTS: The concepts for obtaining
hydrodynamically consistent models using a comoving-frame radiative transfer
are outlined. To provide a useful benchmark, we present a demonstration model,
which was motivated to describe the well-studied O4 supergiant Zeta Pup. The
obtained stellar and wind parameters are within the current range of literature
values. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the PoWR code has been used to obtain
a hydrodynamically consistent model for a massive O star. This has been
achieved by a profound revision of earlier concepts used for Wolf-Rayet stars.
The velocity field is shaped by various elements contributing to the radiative
acceleration, especially in the outer wind. (...)

of the pollution can be accounted for with asteroidal or dwarf planetary

icy and volatile material from Kuiper belt analog objects, are also viable
sources of pollution. The commonly accepted pollution mechanisms, namely
scattering interactions between planetary bodies orbiting the white dwarfs, can
hardly account for pollution by objects with large masses or long-period

wide binary stellar systems, where the mass loss of the planets' host stars

a node can either transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and
listen. At the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in
a round $i$, if $v$ listens in round $i$, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that
transmits in round $i$. If $v$ listens in a round, and multiple neighbors of
$v$ transmit in this round, a collision occurs at $v$. If $v$ transmits in a
round, it does not hear anything. If listening nodes can distinguish collision
from silence, we say that the network has collision detection capability,
otherwise there is no collision detection. We consider the tasks of size
discovery and diameter discovery: finding the size (resp. the diameter) of an
unknown radio network with collision detection. All nodes have to output the
size (resp. the diameter) of the network, using a deterministic algorithm.
Nodes have labels which are binary strings. The length of a labeling scheme is
the largest length of a label. We concentrate on the following problems:
  1. What is the shortest labeling scheme that permits size discovery in all
radio networks of maximum degree $\Delta$? 2. What is the shortest labeling
scheme that permits diameter discovery in all radio networks?
  We show that the minimum length of a labeling scheme that permits size
discovery is $\Theta(\log\log \Delta)$. By contrast, we show that diameter
discovery can be done using a labeling scheme of constant length.

flares, which reach Jy-level fluxes across all of our frequency bands. With
this rich data set we performed detailed MCMC modeling of the repeated flaring

include twin bi-polar ejections, propagating away from the black hole at bulk
relativistic velocities, along a jet axis that is inclined to the line of
sight. The emission predicted by our model accounts for projection effects,
relativistic beaming, and the geometric time delay between the approaching and

stabilizer quantum error correction, which is a promising approach to mitigate
the problem of decoherence in quantum computers. In this work we explore a
high-fidelity, eigenstate-preserving parity readout for superconducting qubits
dispersively coupled to a microwave resonator, where the parity bit is encoded
in the amplitude of a coherent state of the resonator. Detecting photons
emitted by the resonator via a current biased Josephson junction yields
information about the parity bit. We analyse theoretically the measurement
back-action in the limit of a strongly coupled fast detector and show that in
general such a parity measurement, while approximately Quantum Non-Demolition
(QND) is not eigenstate-preserving. To remediate this shortcoming we propose a
simple dynamical decoupling technique during photon detection, which greatly
reduces decoherence within a given parity subspace. Furthermore, by applying a
sequence of fast displacement operations interleaved with the dynamical
decoupling pulses, the natural bias of this binary detector can be efficiently
suppressed. Finally, we introduce the concept of a heralded parity measurement,
where a detector click guarantees successful multi-qubit parity detection even
for finite detection efficiency.

different transient server types offer different cost and availability
tradeoffs, we present the notion of server portfolios that is based on

that ExoSphere enables widely-used parallel applications such as Spark, MPI,

that allowing the applications to use suitable transiency-aware policies,
ExoSphere is able to achieve 80\% cost savings when compared to on-demand

widely crosses category boundaries. They are particularly important in
describing and recognizing concepts where no explicit training example is
given, \textit{e.g., zero-shot learning}. Additionally, since attributes are
human describable, they can be used for efficient human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve facial
attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that many facial
attributes describe local properties. In other words, the probability of an
attribute to appear in a face image is far from being uniform in the spatial
domain. We build our facial attribute prediction model jointly with a deep
semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by
the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to
the regions where different attributes naturally show up. As a result of this
approach, in addition to recognition, we are able to localize the attributes,
despite merely having access to image level labels (weak supervision) during
training. We evaluate our proposed method on CelebA and LFWA datasets and
achieve superior results to the prior arts. Furthermore, we show that in the
reverse problem, semantic face parsing improves when facial attributes are
available. That reaffirms the need to jointly model these two interconnected
tasks.

sequential strong rule (SSR) to remove unnecessary computational burden. In
particular, we present two instances of HSSR, namely SSR-Dome and SSR-BEDPP,

a clear deviation from that correlation. In this paper we apply the theory of
the radio wave propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere for the analysis of
individual effects leading to these deviations. We show that within our theory
the circular polarization of a given mode can switch its sign, without the need
to introduce a new radiation mode or other effects. Moreover, we show that the
generation of different emission modes on different altitudes can explain
pulsars, that presumably have the X-O-X light-curve pattern, different from
what we predict. General properties of radio emission within our propagation
theory are also discussed. In particular, we calculate the intensity patterns
for different radiation altitudes and present light curves for different
observer viewing angles. In this context we also study the light curves and
polarization profiles for pulsars with interpulses. Further, we explain the
characteristic width of the position angle curves by introducing the concept of
a wide emitting region. Another important feature of radio polarization
profiles is the shift of the position angle from the center, which in some
cases demonstrates a weak dependence on the observation frequency. Here we
demonstrate that propagation effects do not necessarily imply a significant
frequency-dependent change of the position angle curve.

defines a `mini-survey' that has its own properties. Coupling with a maximum

the DW tilting during the motion along wire structure. It has been known that
the DW tilting can be induced by the direct Zeeman interaction of the DW
magnetization under application of in plane magnetic field. However, our
experimental observations manifests that there exists another dominant process
with the DW speed asymmetry caused by either the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya
interaction (DMI) or the chirality dependent DW speed variation. A theoretical
model based on the DW geometry reveals that the DW tilting is initiated by the
DW pinning at wire edges and then, the direction of the DW tilting is
determined by the DW speed asymmetry, as confirmed by a numerical simulation.
The present observation reveals the decisive role of the DW pinning with the DW
speed asymmetry, which determines the DW geometry and consequently, the
dynamics.

classification methods which utilize the structure of the label space in a
divide and conquer approach to improve classification performance and allow
large data sets to be classified efficiently. Yet most of the available data
sets have been provided in train/test splits that did not account for
maintaining a distribution of higher-order relationships between labels among
splits or folds. We present a new approach to stratifying multi-label data for
classification purposes based on the iterative stratification approach proposed
by Sechidis et. al. in an ECML PKDD 2011 paper. Our method extends the
iterative approach to take into account second-order relationships between
labels. Obtained results are evaluated using statistical properties of obtained
strata as presented by Sechidis. We also propose new statistical measures
relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution, the percentage of
label pairs without positive evidence in folds and label pair - fold pairs that
have no positive evidence for the label pair. We verify the impact of new
methods on classification performance of Binary Relevance, Label Powerset and a
fast greedy community detection based label space partitioning classifier.
Random Forests serve as base classifiers. We check the variation of the number
of communities obtained per fold, and the stability of their modularity score.
Second-Order Iterative Stratification is compared to standard k-fold, label
set, and iterative stratification. The proposed approach lowers the variance of
classification quality, improves label pair oriented measures and example
distribution while maintaining a competitive quality in label-oriented
measures. We also witness an increase in stability of network characteristics.

popular since it can lead to much less geometry distortion compared with the

observe very obvious texture discontinuity in the area near the face boundary.
Such a texture discontinuity may lead to serious quality degradation when
motion compensation crosses the discontinuous face boundary. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we first propose to fill the corresponding neighboring
faces in the suitable positions as the extension of the current face to keep
approximated texture continuity. Then a co-projection-plane based 3-D padding
method is proposed to project the reference pixels in the neighboring face to
the current face to guarantee exact texture continuity. Under the proposed
scheme, the reference pixel is always projected to the same plane with the
current pixel when performing motion compensation so that the texture
discontinuity problem can be solved. The proposed scheme is implemented in the
reference software of High Efficiency Video Coding. Compared with the existing
method, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the rate-distortion
performance. The experimental results obviously demonstrate that the texture
discontinuity in the face boundary can be well handled by the proposed
algorithm.

distortion patterns over the field arising from the optical train. This
approach is impractical in the presence of a dispersing element because the

Different from the $0^-(1^{--})$ state, the $1^+(1^{+})$ state is a resonance

be related to the first observed charged charmonium-like state $Z(4430)$, which

multi-variate causal inference. However, a number of challenges arises in
learning large-scale DAG models including model identifiability and
computational complexity since the space of directed graphs is huge. In this
paper, we address these issues in a number of steps for a broad class of DAG
models where the noise or variance is signal-dependent. Firstly we introduce a
new class of identifiable DAG models, where each node has a distribution where
the variance is a quadratic function of the mean (QVF DAG models). Our QVF DAG
models include many interesting classes of distributions such as Poisson,
Binomial, Geometric, Exponential, Gamma and many other distributions in which
the noise variance depends on the mean. We prove that this class of QVF DAG
models is identifiable, and introduce a new algorithm, the OverDispersion
Scoring (ODS) algorithm, for learning large-scale QVF DAG models. Our algorithm
is based on firstly learning the moralized or undirected graphical model
representation of the DAG to reduce the DAG search-space, and then exploiting
the quadratic variance property to learn the causal ordering. We show through
theoretical results and simulations that our algorithm is statistically
consistent in the high-dimensional p>n setting provided that the degree of the
moralized graph is bounded and performs well compared to state-of-the-art
DAG-learning algorithms.

triggering behavior with on/off properties that accounts, once it is activated,
for the fast magnetic energy conversion to kinetic and thermal energies at the
heart of explosive events in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Over the
past decade progress has been made on the initiation of fast reconnection via
the plasmoid instability and what has been called ""ideal"" tearing, which sets
in once current sheets thin to a critical inverse aspect ratio $(a/L)_c$: as
shown by Pucci and Velli (2014), at $(a/L)_c \sim S^{-1/3}$ the time scale for
the instability to develop becomes of the order of the Alfv\'en time and
independent of the Lundquist number (here defined in terms of current sheet
length $L$). However, given the large values of $S$ in natural plasmas, this
transition might occur for thicknesses of the inner resistive singular layer
which are comparable to the ion inertial length $d_i$. When this occurs, Hall
currents produce a three-dimensional quadrupole structure of magnetic field,
and the dispersive waves introduced by the Hall effect accelerate the
instability. Here we present a linear study showing how the ""ideal"" tearing
mode critical aspect ratio is modified when Hall effects are taken into
account, including more general scaling laws of the growth rates in terms of
sheet inverse aspect ratio: the critical inverse aspect ratio is amended to
$a/L \simeq (di/L)^ {0.29} (1/S)^{0.19}$, at which point the instability growth
rate becomes Alfv\'enic and does not depend on either of the (small) parameters
$d_i/L, 1/S$. We discuss the implications of this generalized triggering aspect
ratio for recently developed phase diagrams of magnetic reconnection.

become different. We show that the total entropy for this system, which is

deleting any two distinct vertices has a perfect matching. A brick $G$ is
near-bipartite if it has a pair of edges $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that
$G-\{\alpha,\beta\}$ is bipartite and matching covered; examples are $K_4$ and
the triangular prism $\overline{C_6}$. The significance of near-bipartite
bricks arises from the theory of ear decompositions of matching covered graphs.
  The object of this paper is to establish a generation procedure which is
specific to the class of simple near-bipartite bricks. In particular, we prove
that every simple near-bipartite brick $G$ has an edge $e$ so that the graph
obtained from $G-e$ by contracting each edge that is incident with a vertex of
degree two is also a simple near-bipartite brick, unless $G$ belongs to any of
eight well-defined infinite families. This is a refinement of the brick
generation theorem of Norine and Thomas (Generating Bricks, J. Combin. Theory
Ser. B, 2007) which is appropriate for the restricted class of near-bipartite
bricks.
  Earlier, the first author (Generating near-bipartite bricks, J. Graph Theory,
2019) proved a similar generation theorem for (not necessarily simple)

cancer diagnosis. Any improvement in robust and accurate nodule
characterization can assist in identifying cancer stage, prognosis, and
improving treatment planning. In this study, we propose a 3D Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) based nodule characterization strategy. With a completely
3D approach, we utilize the volumetric information from a CT scan which would
be otherwise lost in the conventional 2D CNN based approaches. In order to
address the need for a large amount for training data for CNN, we resort to
transfer learning to obtain highly discriminative features. Moreover, we also
acquire the task dependent feature representation for six high-level nodule
attributes and fuse this complementary information via a Multi-task learning
(MTL) framework. Finally, we propose to incorporate potential disagreement
among radiologists while scoring different nodule attributes in a graph
regularized sparse multi-task learning. We evaluated our proposed approach on
one of the largest publicly available lung nodule datasets comprising 1018
scans and obtained state-of-the-art results in regressing the malignancy

different words can convey affect to various degrees (intensities). However,

fine degrees of association, but they tend not to be accurate as human-created
lexicons. Here, for the first time, we present a manually created affect
intensity lexicon with real-valued scores of intensity for four basic emotions:
anger, fear, joy, and sadness. (We will subsequently add entries for more
emotions such as disgust, anticipation, trust, and surprise.) We refer to this
dataset as the NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon, or AIL for short. AIL has entries
for close to 6,000 English words. We used a technique called best-worst scaling
(BWS) to create the lexicon. BWS improves annotation consistency and obtains
reliable fine-grained scores (split-half reliability > 0.91). We also compare
the entries in AIL with the entries in the NRC VAD Lexicon, which has valence,
arousal, and dominance (VAD) scores for 20K English words. We find that anger,
fear, and sadness words, on average, have very similar VAD scores. However,
sadness words tend to have slightly lower dominance scores than fear and anger
words. The Affect Intensity Lexicon has applications in automatic emotion
analysis in a number of domains such as commerce, education, intelligence, and
public health. AIL is also useful in the building of natural language

tuned by various methods such as doping or applying gate voltage. Here, we show
how to tune electronic properties of BLG by intercalation of transition metal
(TM) atoms between two monolayer graphene (MLG) using a novel
dispersion-corrected first-principle density functional theory approach. We
intercalated V, Nb, and Ta atoms between two MLG. We found that the symmetry,
the spin, and the concentration of TM atoms in BLG-intercalated materials are
the important parameters to control and to obtain a Dirac Cone in their band
structures. Our study reveals that the BLG intercalated with one Vanadium (V)
atom, BLG-1V, has a Dirac Cone at the K-point. In all the cases, the present
DFT calculations show that the 2$p_z$ sub-shells of C atoms in graphene and the
3$d_{yz}$ sub-shells of the TM atoms provide the electron density near the
Fermi level E$\mathrm{_F}$ which controls the material properties. Thus, we
show that out-of-plane atoms can influence in-plane electronic densities in
BLG, and enumerate the conditions necessary to control the Dirac point. This
study presents a new strategy for controlling the material properties of BLG so
that they exhibit various behaviors, including: metal, semi-metal, and

thermal expansion even at temperatures as high as 1000K. The linear thermal
expansion coefficients (LTEC) of two-dimensional honeycomb structured pure
graphene and B/N doped graphene are analyzed using ab initio density functional
perturbation theory (DFPT) employed in VASP software under quasiharmonic
approximation. One of the essential ingredients required is the phonon
frequencies for a set of points in the Brillouin zone and their volume
dependence. These were obtained from the dynamical matrix which was calculated
using VASP code in interface with phonopy code. In particular, the transverse
acoustic modes (ZA) behave drastically differently as compared to planer modes
and so also their volume dependence. Using this approach firstly thermal
expansion for pure graphene is calculated. The results agree with earlier
calculations using similar approach. Thereafter we have studied the effect of
boron and nitrogen doping on LTEC. The LTEC of graphene is found to be negative
in the entire range of temperature under study (0-1000K) and its value at room
temperature (RT) is around -3.26X10-6K-1. The value of LTEC at RT becomes more
negative with B/N doping in graphene. In order to get an insight into the cause
of negative thermal expansion, we have computed the contribution of individual
phonon modes of vibration. We notice that it is principally the ZA modes which
are responsible for negative thermal expansion. It has been concluded that
transverse mode in 2D hexagonal lattices have an important role to play in many
of the thermodynamical properties of 2D structures. We have extended the study
to calculate the LTEC of h-BN sheet also.

networks in computer vision and NLP tasks, such improvements have not yet been
observed in ranking for information retrieval. The reason may be the complexity
of the ranking problem, as it is not obvious how to learn from queries and
documents when no supervised signal is available. Hence, in this paper, we
propose to train a neural ranking model using weak supervision, where labels
are obtained automatically without human annotators or any external resources
(e.g., click data). To this aim, we use the output of an unsupervised ranking
model, such as BM25, as a weak supervision signal. We further train a set of
simple yet effective ranking models based on feed-forward neural networks. We
study their effectiveness under various learning scenarios (point-wise and
pair-wise models) and using different input representations (i.e., from
encoding query-document pairs into dense/sparse vectors to using word embedding
representation). We train our networks using tens of millions of training
instances and evaluate it on two standard collections: a homogeneous news
collection(Robust) and a heterogeneous large-scale web collection (ClueWeb).
Our experiments indicate that employing proper objective functions and letting
the networks to learn the input representation based on weakly supervised data
leads to impressive performance, with over 13% and 35% MAP improvements over
the BM25 model on the Robust and the ClueWeb collections. Our findings also
suggest that supervised neural ranking models can greatly benefit from
pre-training on large amounts of weakly labeled data that can be easily
obtained from unsupervised IR models.

Array (SKA) telescope requires high-precision frequency references to be

SKA engineering requirements demand that any proposed frequency reference
distribution system be proved in ""astronomical verification"" tests. We present
results of the astronomical verification of a stabilized frequency reference
transfer system proposed for SKA-mid. The dual-receiver architecture of the
Australia Telescope Compact Array was exploited to subtract the phase-noise of
the sky signal from the data, allowing the phase-noise of observations
performed using a standard frequency reference, as well as the stabilized
frequency reference transfer system transmitting over 77 km of fiber-optic
cable, to be directly compared. Results are presented for the fractional
frequency stability and phase-drift of the stabilized frequency reference
transfer system for celestial calibrator observations at 5 GHz and 25 GHz.
These observations plus additional laboratory results for the transferred
signal stability over a 166 km metropolitan fiber-optic link are used to show
that the stabilized transfer system under test exceeds all SKA phase-stability
requirements under a broad range of observing conditions. Furthermore, we have
shown that alternative reference dissemination systems that use multiple
synthesizers to supply reference signals to sub-sections of an array may limit
the imaging capability of the telescope.

residual radionuclides. Method: Natural niobium ($^{93}$Nb) foil, backed by

20-45 MeV energy. Activity of the residues produced in each $^{93}$Nb target
was measured by off-line $\gamma$-ray spectrometry after the end of bombardment

perceived.

which evolutionary algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), are most
commonly used. However, the individual encoding scheme used in various GAs
would either pose a bias on the solution or require a pre-specified number of
features, and hence may lead to less accurate results. In this paper, a tribe
competition-based genetic algorithm (TCbGA) is proposed for feature selection
in pattern classification. The population of individuals is divided into
multiple tribes, and the initialization and evolutionary operations are
modified to ensure that the number of selected features in each tribe follows a
Gaussian distribution. Thus each tribe focuses on exploring a specific part of
the solution space. Meanwhile, tribe competition is introduced to the evolution
process, which allows the winning tribes, which produce better individuals, to
enlarge their sizes, i.e. having more individuals to search their parts of the
solution space. This algorithm, therefore, avoids the bias on solutions and
requirement of a pre-specified number of features. We have evaluated our
algorithm against several state-of-the-art feature selection approaches on 20
benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that the proposed TCbGA algorithm can
identify the optimal feature subset more effectively and produce more accurate
pattern classification.

  In the first part we develop two linear-time algorithms for regular

algorithm operates in two passes in a semi-streaming fashion, using a constant
amount of working memory and an auxiliary tape storage which is written in the
first pass and consumed by the second. The second algorithm is a single-pass

semantically possible based on the input prefix read so far, and resorts to
buffering as many symbols as is required to resolve the next choice. Optimality
is obtained by performing a PSPACE-complete pre-analysis on the regular

  In the second part we present Kleenex, a language for expressing
high-performance streaming string processing programs as regular grammars with
embedded semantic actions, and its compilation to streaming string transducers
with worst-case linear-time performance. Its underlying theory is based on
transducer decomposition into oracle and action machines, and a finite-state

contemporary imaging modalities across the physical and life sciences including
optical, MRI, CT, PET, and radio astronomy. During an image acquisition, the
sensor encodes an intermediate representation of an object in the sensor
domain, which is subsequently reconstructed into an image by an inversion of
the encoding function. Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic
knowledge of the inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the
presence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction
approach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc
stages in a signal processing chain whose composition depends on the details of
each acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to
optimize reconstruction performance. We present here a unified framework for
image reconstruction, AUtomated TransfOrm by Manifold APproximation (AUTOMAP),
which recasts image reconstruction as a data-driven, supervised learning task
that allows a mapping between sensor and image domain to emerge from an
appropriate corpus of training data. We implement AUTOMAP with a deep neural
network and exhibit its flexibility in learning reconstruction transforms for a
variety of MRI acquisition strategies, using the same network architecture and
hyperparameters. We further demonstrate its efficiency in sparsely representing
transforms along low-dimensional manifolds, resulting in superior immunity to
noise and reconstruction artifacts compared with conventional handcrafted
reconstruction methods. In addition to improving the reconstruction performance
of existing acquisition methodologies, we anticipate accelerating the discovery
of new acquisition strategies across modalities as the burden of reconstruction
becomes lifted by AUTOMAP and learned-reconstruction approaches.

derive enhanced regularity spatial properties both for the displacement and
damage fields. Thus, we are in a position to work with a stronger solution

vanishing-viscosity analysis then leads us to obtain the existence of a
stronger solution concept for the rate-independent limit system. Furthermore,

superconductor FeSe, it is argued that the system may locate in the crossover
region of BCS to BEC, indicating a strong superconducting fluctuation. In this
respect, we have carried out measurements of magnetization, specific heat and
Nernst effect on FeSe single crystals in order to investigate the
superconducting fluctuation effect near $T_c$. The region of diamagnetization
induced by superconducting fluctuation seems very narrow above $T_c$. The
crossing point of temperature dependent magnetization curves measured at
different magnetic fields, which appears in many systems of cuprate
superconductors and is regarded as indication of strong critical fluctuation,
is however absent. The magnetization data can be scaled based on the
Ginzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a quasi-two-dimensional system, but the
scaling result cannot be described by the theoretical function of the
fluctuation theory because of the limited fluctuation regions. The specific
heat jump near $T_c$ is rather sharp without the trace of strong
superconducting fluctuation. This is also supported by the Nernst effect
measurements which indicate a very limited region for vortex motion above
$T_c$. Associated with very small value of Ginzburg number and further
analyses, we conclude that the superconducting fluctuation is very weak above
$T_c$ in this material. Our results are strongly against the picture of
significant phase fluctuation in FeSe single crystals, although the system has
a very limited overlapping of Cooper pairs in the coherence volume. This
dichotomy provides new insights into the superconducting mechanism when the

of user check-in data, which facilitates the recommendation of points of

learning low dimensional dense vectors to alleviate the data sparsity problem.
Current studies on representation learning for POI recommendation embed both
users and POIs in a common latent space, and users' preference is inferred
based on the distance/similarity between a user and a POI. Such an approach is
not in accordance with the semantics of users and POIs as they are inherently
different objects. In this paper, we present a novel spatiotemporal aware (STA)
representation, which models the spatial and temporal information as \emph{a
relationship connecting users and POIs}. Our model generalizes the recent
advances in knowledge graph embedding. The basic idea is that the embedding of
a $<$time, location$>$ pair corresponds to a translation from embeddings of
users to POIs. Since the POI embedding should be close to the user embedding
plus the relationship vector, the recommendation can be performed by selecting
the top-\emph{k} POIs similar to the translated POI, which are all of the same
type of objects. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate that our STA model achieves the state-of-the-art
performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data

enforcing powerful surveillance measures on suspicious individuals or

on a dubious communication link between a suspicious pair via proactive
jamming. Assuming that the legitimate monitor can successfully overhear the
suspicious information only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than

eavesdropping non-outage probability by joint design of the jamming power,
receive and transmit beamformers at the legitimate monitor. Depending on the
number of receive/transmit antennas implemented, i.e., single-input
single-output, single-input multiple-output, multiple-input single-output and
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), four different scenarios are
investigated. For each scenario, the optimal jamming power is derived in
closed-form and efficient algorithms are obtained for the optimal

beamforming schemes are proposed for the MIMO case. Our analytical findings
demonstrate that by exploiting multiple antennas at the legitimate monitor, the

$(k,r)$-Center is W[1]-hard parameterized by the input graph's vertex cover (if
edge weights are allowed), or feedback vertex set, even if $k$ is an additional

(RS) galaxy luminosity function (GLF) with redshift is a milestone in
understanding galaxy evolution. However, the community is still divided in that
respect, hesitating between an enrichment of the RS due to efficient quenching
of blue galaxies from $z\sim1$ to present-day or a scenario in which the RS is
built at a higher redshift and does not evolve afterwards. Recently, it has
been proposed that surface brightness (SB) selection effects could possibly
solve the literature disagreement, accounting for the diminishing of the RS
faint population in ground based observations. We investigate this hypothesis
by comparing the RS GLFs of 16 CLASH clusters computed independently from
ground-based Subaru/Suprime-Cam and HST/ACS images in the redshift range
$0.187\leq z\leq0.686$. We stack individual cluster GLFs in redshift and mass
bins.
  We find similar RS GLFs for space and ground based data, with a difference of
0.2$\sigma$ in the faint end parameter $\alpha$ when stacking all clusters
together and a maximum difference of 0.9$\sigma$ in the case of the high
redshift stack, demonstrating a weak dependence on the type of observations in
the probed range of redshift and mass. When considering the full sample, we
estimate $\alpha = -0.76 \pm 0.07$ and $\alpha = -0.78 \pm 0.06$ with HST and
Subaru respectively. We note a mild variation of the faint end with redshift at
a 1.7$\sigma$ and 2.6$\sigma$ significance. We investigate the effect of SB
dimming by simulating our low redshift galaxies at high redshift. We measure an
evolution in the faint end slope of less than 1$\sigma$ in this case, implying
that the observed signature is moderately larger than one would expect from SB
dimming alone, and indicating a true evolution in the faint end slope.

architectural modelsin the design and analysis of scheduling arrangements for
mixedcriticalitysystems can provide greater confidence in the analysis,but also
opportunities for better performance. Motivated by thisview, we propose an
extension of Vestal 19s model for mixedcriticalitymulticore systems that (i)
accounts for the per-taskpartitioning of the last-level cache and (ii) supports
the dynamicreassignment, for better schedulability, of cache portions
initiallyreserved for lower-criticality tasks to the higher-criticalitytasks,
when the system switches to high-criticality mode. Tothis model, we apply
partitioned EDF scheduling with Ekbergand Yi 19s deadline-scaling technique.
Our schedulability analysisand scalefactor calculation is cognisant of the
cache resourcesassigned to each task, by using WCET estimates that take
intoaccount these resources. It is hence able to leverage the
dynamicreconfiguration of the cache partitioning, at mode change, forbetter
performance, in terms of provable schedulability. We alsopropose heuristics for
partitioning the cache in low- and highcriticalitymode, that promote
schedulability. Our experimentswith synthetic task sets, indicate tangible
improvements inschedulability compared to a baseline cache-aware
arrangementwhere there is no redistribution of cache resources from low-
tohigh-criticality tasks in the event of a mode change.

different nodes of an unknown network, have to meet at the same node and
terminate. This problem is known as {\em gathering}. We study deterministic
gathering algorithms under the assumption that agents are subject to {\em crash
faults} which can occur at any time. Two fault scenarios are considered. A {\em
motion fault} immobilizes the agent at a node or inside an edge but leaves
intact its memory at the time when the fault occurred. A more severe {\em total
fault} immobilizes the agent as well, but also erases its entire memory. Of
course, we cannot require faulty agents to gather. Thus the gathering problem
for fault prone agents calls for all fault-free agents to gather at a single
node, and terminate.
  When agents move completely asynchronously, gathering with crash faults of
any type is impossible. Hence we consider a restricted version of asynchrony,
where each agent is assigned by the adversary a fixed speed, possibly different
for each agent. Agents have clocks ticking at the same rate. Each agent can
wait for a time of its choice at any node, or decide to traverse an edge but
then it moves at constant speed assigned to it. Moreover, agents have different
labels. Each agent knows its label and speed but not those of other agents.
  We construct a gathering algorithm working for any team of at least two
agents in the scenario of motion faults, and a gathering algorithm working in
the presence of total faults, provided that at least two agents are fault free
all the time. If only one agent is fault free, the task of gathering with total
faults is sometimes impossible. Both our algorithms work in time polynomial in
the size of the graph, in the logarithm of the largest label, in the inverse of
the smallest speed, and in the ratio between the largest and the smallest
speed.

in quark mean field model with pion and gluon corrections. Firstly, $u, ~d$,
and $s$ quarks are confined by relativistic harmonic oscillator potentials to
generate the baryons, like nucleon, $\Lambda, ~\Sigma$, and $\Xi$ hyperons. The
effects of pion-quark coupling and one-gluon exchange are considered
perturbatively. Then, the baryons interact with each other through exchanging
$\sigma, ~\omega,$ and $\rho$ mesons between quarks in hypernuclei and nuclear
matter. The strengths of confinement potentials for $u, ~d,$ and $s$ quarks are
determined by the masses and radii of free baryons. The coupling constants
between the quarks and mesons are fixed by the ground-state properties of
several nuclei and single-hyperon potentials at nuclear saturation density,
which arises three parameter sets for the coupling constants between mesons and
quarks, named QMF-NK1S, QMF-NK2S, and QMF-NK3S. Compared to the results of
previous quark mean field model without pion and gluon corrections, it is found
that properties of $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, i.e. the single $\Lambda$ energies,
are more consistent with the experimental observables. Properties of $\Xi^0$
hypernuclei are also calculated and compared with the results in previous quark
mean field model. With these three parameter sets, the neutron stars containing
hyperons are investigated through solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equation. Maximum masses of neutron stars approach $2.1M_\odot$ with hyperons
and corresponding radii are around $13$ km.

the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun in which the relations between modules are
enriched with mutual exclusivity while genes within each module are
functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo which combines mutual exclusivity
between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun
which ensures co-occurrence between modules while the within module relations
combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the
BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find
optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of
BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes,
and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent
modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding
previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to the importance
of the interaction between NCOR and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an
application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with
respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us
to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergetic effects, including a
potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and metastasis related DCC gene.

in level set methods by solving a biharmonic equation. The approach differs
from other commonly used approaches to velocity extension because it deals with
the interface fully implicitly through the level set function. No explicit
properties of the interface, such as its location or the velocity on the
interface, are required in computing the extension. These features lead to a
particularly simple implementation using either a sparse direct solver or a
matrix-free conjugate gradient solver. Furthermore, we propose a fast Poisson
preconditioner that can be used to accelerate the convergence of the latter.
  We demonstrate the biharmonic extension on a number of test problems that
serve to illustrate its effectiveness at producing smooth and accurate
extensions near interfaces. A further feature of the method is the natural way
in which it deals with symmetry and periodicity, ensuring through its
construction that the extension field also respects these symmetries.

program properties, such as intervals or congruences for integer variables.
Galois connections (GCs) between posets provide the most widespread and useful
formal tool for mathematically specifying abstract domains. Recently, Darais
and Van Horn [2016] put forward a notion of constructive Galois connection for
unordered sets (rather than posets), which allows to define abstract domains in
a so-called mechanized and calculational proof style and therefore enables the
use of proof assistants like Coq and Agda for automatically extracting verified
algorithms of static analysis. We show here that constructive GCs are
isomorphic, in a precise and comprehensive meaning including sound abstract
functions, to so-called partitioning GCs--an already known class of GCs which
allows to cast standard set partitions as an abstract domain. Darais and Van
Horn [2016] also provide a notion of constructive GC for posets, which we prove
to be isomorphic to plain GCs and therefore lose their constructive attribute.
Drawing on these findings, we put forward and advocate the use of purely
partitioning GCs, a novel class of constructive abstract domains for a
mechanized approach to abstract interpretation. We show that this class of
abstract domains allows us to represent a set partition with more flexibility
while retaining a constructive approach to Galois connections.

\mbox{span} \{f_k\}_{k\in \mathbf Z} \to \mbox{span}\{f_k\}_{k\in \mathbf Z}$.
A key result characterizes boundedness of the operator $T$ in terms of
shift-invariance of a certain sequence space. One of the consequences is a
characterization of the case where the representation $\{f_k\}_{k\in \mathbf
Z}=\{T^kf_0\}_{k\in\mathbf Z}$ can be achieved for an operator $T$ that has an
extension to a bounded bijective operator $\widetilde{T}: \cal H \to \cal H.$
In this case we also characterize all the dual frames that are representable in
terms of iterations of an operator $V;$ in particular we prove that the only
possible operator is $V=(\widetilde{T}^*)^{-1}.$ Finally, we consider stability
of the representation $\{T^kf_0\}_{k\in\mathbf Z};$ rather surprisingly, it
turns out that the possibility to represent a frame on this form is sensitive
towards some of the classical perturbation conditions in frame theory. Various
ways of avoiding this problem will be discussed. Throughout the paper the
results will be connected with the operators and function systems appearing in
applied harmonic analysis, as well as with general group representations.

Multi-Input-Single-Output (MU-MISO) communication system. By exploiting the
constructive multi-user interference (MUI), the proposed approach trades-off
useful MUI power for reducing the transmit power, to obtain a power efficient
transmission. This paper focuses on two optimization problems: a) Transmit
power minimization at the base station (BS) while guaranteeing the receive
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) level of downlink users and the
interference-to-noise ratio (INR) level to radar; b) Minimization of the
interference from BS to radar for a given requirement of downlink SINR and
transmit power budget. To reduce the computational overhead of the proposed
scheme in practice, an algorithm based on gradient projection is designed to
solve the power minimization problem. In addition, we investigate the trade-off
between the performance of radar and communication, and analytically derive the
key metrics for MIMO radar in the presence of the interference from the BS.
Finally, a robust power minimization problem is formulated to ensure the
effectiveness of the proposed method in the case of imperfect Channel State

significant power saving compared to conventional approaches, while obtaining a
favorable performance-complexity trade-off.

decisions processes, is that often the state of the system is not directly
observable at any single location in the system. The participants in the
control scheme must share information with one another regarding the state of
the system in order to collectively make informed control decisions, but this
information sharing can be costly. Harnessing recent results from information
theory regarding distributed function computation, in this paper we derive, for
several information sharing model structures, the minimum amount of control
information that must be exchanged to enable local participants to derive the
same control decisions as an imaginary omniscient controller having full
knowledge of the global state. Incorporating consideration for this amount of
information that must be exchanged into the reward enables one to trade the
competing objectives of minimizing this control information exchange and
maximizing the performance of the controller. An alternating optimization
framework is then provided to help find the efficient controllers and messaging
schemes. A series of running examples from wireless resource allocation

  document is subject to change, and has been uploaded prior to my Ph.D. viva",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov processes are well understood in the case when they take place in the
whole Euclidean space. However, the situation becomes much more complicated if
a Markov process is restricted to a domain with a boundary, and then a
satisfactory theory only exists for processes with continuous trajectories.
This research, into non-classical boundary value problems, is motivated by the
study of stochastic processes, restricted to a domain, that can have
discontinuous trajectories.
  To make this general problem more tractable, we consider a particular
operator, $\mathcal{A}$, which is chosen to be the generator of a certain
stable L\'evy process restricted to the positive half-line. We are able to
represent $\mathcal{A}$ as a (hyper-) singular integral and, using this
representation, deduce simple conditions for its boundedness, between Bessel
potential spaces. Moreover, from energy estimates, we prove that, under certain
conditions, $\mathcal{A}$ has a trivial kernel.
  A central feature of this research is our use of Mellin operators to deal
with the leading singular terms that combine, and cancel, at the boundary.
Indeed, after considerable analysis, the problem is reformulated in the context
of an algebra of multiplication, Wiener-Hopf and Mellin operators, acting on a
Lebesgue space. The resulting generalised symbol is examined and, it turns out,
that a certain transcendental equation, involving gamma and trigonometric
functions with complex arguments, plays a pivotal role. Following detailed
consideration of this transcendental equation, we are able to determine when
our operator is Fredholm and, in that case, calculate its index. Finally,
combining information on the kernel with the Fredholm index, we establish
precise conditions for the invertibility of $\mathcal{A}$.

fluctuations in their catalytic activity, which are associated with
conformational changes on a broad range of timescales. The experimental study
of this phenomenon, termed dynamic disorder, has become possible due to
advances in single-molecule enzymology measurement techniques, through which
the catalytic activity of individual enzyme molecules can be tracked in time.
The biological role and importance of these fluctuations in a system with a
small number of enzymes such as a living cell have only recently started being
explored. In this work, we examine a simple stochastic reaction system
consisting of an inflowing substrate and an enzyme with a randomly fluctuating
catalytic reaction rate that converts the substrate into an outflowing product.
To describe analytically the effect of rate fluctuations on the average
substrate abundance at steady-state, we derive an explicit formula that
connects the relative speed of enzymatic fluctuations with the mean substrate
level. We demonstrate that the relative speed of rate fluctuations can have a
dramatic effect on the mean substrate, and lead to large positive deviations
from predictions based on the assumption of deterministic enzyme activity. Our
results also establish an interesting connection between the amplification
effect and the mixing properties of the Markov process describing the enzymatic
activity fluctuations, which can be used to easily predict the fluctuation
speed above which such deviations become negligible. As the techniques of
single-molecule enzymology continuously evolve, it may soon be possible to
study the stochastic phenomena due to enzymatic activity fluctuations within
living cells. Our work can be used to formulate experimentally testable
hypotheses regarding the magnitude of these fluctuations, as well as their
phenotypic consequences.

only affects quantum correlations. Here we identify two regimes in the
decoherence dynamics: a mixed regime when both classical and quantum
correlations decay and a quantum regime when only quantum correlations decay.
We show that the freezing of classical correlations can be stable or metastable

dark matter halos as tracers of the density field. We find that the voids are
completely unscreened, and the tangential velocity and velocity dispersion

Density-Functional Theory (DFT) community are searching for accurate electron
density functionals. Arguably, the toughest functional to approximate is the
noninteracting Kinetic Energy, $T_s[\rho]$, the subject of this work. The
typical paradigm is to first approximate the energy functional, and then take
its functional derivative, $\frac{\delta T_s[\rho]}{\delta \rho(r)}$, yielding
a potential that can be used in orbital-free DFT, or subsystem DFT simulations.
Here, this paradigm is challenged by constructing the potential from the
second-functional derivative via functional integration. A new nonlocal
functional for $T_s[\rho]$ is prescribed (which we dub MGP) having a density
independent kernel. MGP is constructed to satisfy three exact conditions: (1) a
nonzero ""Kinetic electron"" arising from a nonzero exchange hole; (2) the second
functional derivative must reduce to the inverse Lindhard function in the limit
of homogenous densities; (3) the potential derives from functional integration
of the second functional derivative. Pilot calculations show that MGP is
capable of reproducing accurate equilibrium volumes, bulk moduli, total energy,
and electron densities for metallic (BCC, FCC) and semiconducting (CD) phases
of Silicon as well as of III-V semiconductors. MGP functional is found to be
numerically stable typically reaching selfconsistency within 12 iteration of a

the prompt reformation of closed magnetic surfaces at the plasma core and, to a

appears consistent with a phase averaging effect due to orbit shifts at high
energy.

resource utilization, while providing performance isolation: although the
underlying resources are shared, the virtual network appears as a dedicated
network to the tenant. However, providing such an illusion is challenging in
practice, and over the last years, many expedient approaches have been proposed
to provide performance isolation in virtual networks, by enforcing bandwidth
reservations. We in this paper study another source for overheads and
unpredictable performance in virtual networks: the hypervisor.
  The hypervisor is a critical component in multi-tenant environments, but its
overhead and influence on performance are hardly understood today. In
particular, we focus on OpenFlow-based virtualized Software Defined Networks
(vSDNs). Network virtualization is considered a killer application for SDNs: a
vSDN allows each tenant to flexibly manage its network from a logically
centralized perspective, via a simple API. For the purpose of our study, we
developed a new benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes,
enabling high and consistent OpenFlow message rates. Using our tool, we
identify and measure controllable and uncontrollable effects on performance and
overhead, including the hypervisor technology, the number of tenants as well as
the tenant type, as well as the type of OpenFlow messages.

such disks and study them in detail. HH 212 is a very young protostellar

dust emission at submillimeter wavelength. The disk is nearly edge-on and has a
radius of ~ 60 AU. Interestingly, it shows a prominent equatorial dark lane
sandwiched between two brighter features, due to relatively low temperature and
high optical depth near the disk midplane. For the first time, this dark lane
is seen at submillimeter wavelength, producing a ""hamburger""-shaped appearance

  Conversational Models","Accepted to SIGDIAL 2017",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural conversational models require substantial amounts of dialogue data for
their parameter estimation and are therefore usually learned on large corpora
such as chat forums or movie subtitles. These corpora are, however, often
challenging to work with, notably due to their frequent lack of turn
segmentation and the presence of multiple references external to the dialogue
itself. This paper shows that these challenges can be mitigated by adding a
weighting model into the architecture. The weighting model, which is itself
estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical
weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling. At training
time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be
minimised. Evaluation results on retrieval-based models trained on movie and TV
subtitles demonstrate that the inclusion of such a weighting model improves the
model performance on unsupervised metrics.

luminosity excess and the abnormally large radius of some hot Jupiters. In
giant planet interiors, it could lead to the creation of density staircases,
which are convective layers separated by thin stably stratified interfaces. We
study the propagation of internal waves in a region of layered semi-convection,
with the aim to predict energy transport by internal waves incident upon a
density staircase. The goal is then to understand the resulting tidal
dissipation when these waves are excited by other bodies such as moons in giant
planets systems. We use a local Cartesian analytical model, taking into account
the complete Coriolis acceleration at any latitude, thus generalizing previous
works. We find transmission of incident internal waves to be strongly affected
by the presence of a density staircase, even if these waves are initially pure
inertial waves (which are restored by the Coriolis acceleration). In
particular, low-frequency waves of all wavelengths are perfectly transmitted
near the critical latitude. Otherwise, short-wavelength waves are only
efficiently transmitted if they are resonant with a free mode (interfacial
gravity wave or short-wavelength inertial mode) of the staircase. In all other
cases, waves are primarily reflected unless their wavelengths are longer than
the vertical extent of the entire staircase (not just a single step). We expect
incident internal waves to be strongly affected by the presence of a density
staircase in a frequency-, latitude- and wavelength-dependent manner. First,
this could lead to new criteria to probe the interior of giant planets by
seismology; and second, this may have important consequences for tidal
dissipation and our understanding of the evolution of giant planet systems.

We then introduce Cosmological Perturbation Theory (CPT) at linear order for a

perturbations to a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) background spacetime. Studying
the transformation behaviour of the perturbations under gauge transformations,
we construct gauge invariant quantities in LTB. We show, using the perturbed
energy conservation equation, that there is a conserved quantity in LTB which
is conserved on all scales. We then briefly extend our discussion to the
Lemaitre spacetime, and construct gauge-invariant perturbations in this
extension of LTB spacetime. We also study the behaviour of linear perturbations
in assisted coupled quintessence models in a FRW background. We provide the
full set of governing equations for this class of models, and solve the system
numerically. The code written for this purpose is then used to evolve growth
functions for various models and parameter values, and we compare these both to
the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and to current and future observational bounds.
We also examine the applicability of the ""small scale approximation"", often
used to calculate growth functions in quintessence models, in light of upcoming
experiments such as SKA and Euclid. We find the results of the full equations
deviates from the approximation by more than the experimental uncertainty for
these future surveys. The construction of the numerical code, PYESSENCE,

We prove the existence of a single global maximum of the force and find its

modeling. Benefit from the recent advances in computation power and software
development, millions of models built upon multiple regressions, time series

with smaller validation errors were selected to form the ensemble model. To
better capture the distinct characteristics, forecasting models were
implemented at lead time and lines of business level. The moving windows
validation process automatically selected the models which closely represent
current market condition. The weekly cadence forecasting schema allowed the
model to response effectively to market fluctuation. Generic variable
importance analysis was also developed to increase the model interpretability.
Rather than assuming fixed distribution, this non-parametric permutation
variable importance analysis provided a general framework across methods to
evaluate the variable importance. This variable importance framework can
further extend to classification problem by modifying the mean absolute

method of matched asymptotic expansions to derive a low-dimensional macroscopic
system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the evolution of

we find that the next reaction term in the expansion is needed to ensure good
agreement with simulations of the microscopic model. Our macroscopic model
allows for more direct parameterization to experimental data than the models

Proc R Soc

space-time microstructures whose geometry in one spatial dimension plus time is
somehow commensurate to the slope of the characteristic lines. In particular,
in [Milton, Mattei. Proc R Soc A. 2017] the authors propose two examples of
space-time geometries in which field patterns occur: they are two-phase
microstructures in which rectangular space-time inclusions of one material are
embedded in another material. After a sufficient large period of time, the
field patterns in both microstructures have local periodicity both in time and
space, due to the PT-symmetry of the chosen space-time geometries. This allows
one to focus only on solving the problem on a discrete network and to define a
suitable transfer matrix that, given the solution at a certain time, provides
the solution after one time period. Many of the eigenvalues of this transfer
matrix have unit norm and hence the corresponding eigenvectors correspond to
propagating modes. However, there are also modes that blow up exponentially
with time coupled with modes that decrease exponentially with time. The
question as to whether there are space-time microstructures such that the
transfer matrix only has eigenvalues on the unit circle finds answer in this
paper where we see that certain space-time checkerboards have the property that
all the modes are propagating modes, within a certain range of the material
parameters. Interestingly, when there is no blow-up, the waves generated by an
instantaneous disturbance at a point look like shocks with a wake of
oscillatory waves. This sets an arrow of time in the sense that it would be
extremely difficult to produce the initial conditions necessary to create the

field effect transistors (GFETs) to get a competitive radio frequency (RF)
performance. Carrier mobility and saturation velocity were obtained from an
ensemble Monte Carlo simulator that accounted for the relevant scattering
mechanisms (intrinsic phonons, scattering with impurities and defects, etc.).
This information is fed into a self consistent simulator, which solves the
drift diffusion equation coupled with the two dimensional Poisson's equation to
take full account of short channel effects. Simulated GFET characteristics were
benchmarked against experimental data from our fabricated devices. Our
simulations show that scalability is supposed to bring to RF performance an
improvement that is, however, highly limited by instability. Despite the
possibility of a lower performance, a careful choice of the bias point can
avoid instability. Nevertheless, maximum oscillation frequencies are still
achievable in the THz region for channel lengths of a few hundreds of

insights into the processes of fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media. It
introduces however several parameters whose values are usually uncertain. We
herein explore the effect of the imperfect knowledge of the system parameters
and their variability on the model quantities of interest (QoIs) characterizing
the NC mechanisms. To this end, we use GSA in conjunction with the polynomial
chaos expansion (PCE) methodology. In particular, GSA is performed using Sobol'
sensitivity indices. Moreover, the probability distributions of the QoIs
assessing the flow and heat transfer are obtained by performing UQ using PCE as
a surrogate of the original computational model. The results demonstrate that
the temperature distribution is mainly controlled by the longitudinal thermal
dispersion coefficient. The variability of the average Nusselt number is
controlled by the Rayleigh number and transverse dispersion coefficient. The
velocity field is mainly sensitive to the Rayleigh number and permeability
anisotropy ratio. The heterogeneity slightly affects the heat transfer in the
cavity and has a major effect on the flow patterns. The methodology presented
in this work allows performing in-depth analyses in order to provide relevant
information for the interpretation of a NC problem in porous media at low
computational costs.

in restricted domains by measuring line integrals of projections of these
vector fields. Here, we deal with the reconstruction of irrotational vector
functions from boundary measurements. As the majority of inverse problems,
vector field recovery is an ill posed in the continuous domain and therefore
further assumptions, measurements and constraints should be imposed for the
full vector field estimation. The reconstruction idea in the discrete domain
relies on solving a numerical system of linear equations which derives from the
approximation of the line integrals along lines which trace the bounded domain.
This work presents an extensive description of a vector field recovery, the
fundamental assumptions and the ill conditioning of this inverse problem. More
importantly we show that this inverse problem is regularized via the domain
discretization, i.e. we show that the recovery of an irrotational vector field
within a discrete grid employing a finite set of longitudinal line integrals,
leads to a consistent linear system which has bounded solution errors. We
elaborate on the estimation of the solution's error and we prove that this
relative error is finite and therefore a stable vector field reconstruction is
ensured. Such theoretical aspects are critical for future implementations of
vector tomography in practical applications like the inverse bioelectric field
problem. We validate our theoretical results by performing simulations that
reconstruct smooth irrotational fields based solely on a finite number of
boundary measurements and without the need of any additional or prior
information (e.g. transversal line integrals or source free assumption).

serious problem in past two decades. The air pollution is caused by
contamination of air due to various natural and anthropogenic activities. The
growing air pollution has diverse adverse effects on human health and other
living species. However, a significant reduction in the concentration of air
pollutants has been observed during the rainy season. Recently, a number of
studies have been performed to understand the mechanism of removal of air
pollutants due to the rain. These studies have found that rain is helpful in
removing many air pollutants from the environment. In this paper, we proposed a
mathematical model to investigate the role of rain in removal of air pollutants
and its subsequent impacts on human population.

  Combustion","Submitted to Mediterranean Combustion Symposium 2017",,,,"physics.flu-dyn math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In practical combustion systems, the high nonlinearity of the turbulent
combustion process can result in unexpected behavior even for nominal operating
conditions. This includes flame flashback in premixed gas turbines, engine
unstart in scramjets, and failure of engines to ignite at high altitudes. Many
of these events have catastrophic consequences. Hence, understanding the nature
of such irregular excursions of combustion systems is important to ensure
robust operation. The focus of this work is to identify the sources of such
rare excursions from a dynamical systems perspective. Specifically, such
anomalous behavior can be explained in terms of three different classes based
on the trajectories that the system traverses in its phase-space. For each
class, computational algorithms and validation exercises are briefly discussed.

is expected to become predominant in the next decade. However, in order for
this technology to unfold its full potential it is necessary to develop a
fundamental understanding of the distinctive features of air-to-ground (A2G)
links. As a contribution in this direction, this paper proposes a generic
framework for the analysis and optimization of the A2G systems. In contrast to
the existing literature, this framework incorporates both height-dependent path
loss exponent and small-scale fading, and unifies a widely used
ground-to-ground channel model with that of A2G for analysis of large-scale
wireless networks. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal UAV height
that minimizes the outage probability of a given A2G link. Moreover, our
framework allows us to derive a height-dependent closed-form expression and a
tight lower bound for the outage probability of an \textit{A2G cooperative
communication} network. Our results suggest that the optimal location of the
UAVs with respect to the ground nodes does not change by the inclusion of
ground relays. This enables interesting insights in the deployment of future
A2G networks, as the system reliability could be adjusted dynamically by adding
relaying nodes without requiring changes in the position of the corresponding
UAVs.

  Detected Objects in a Video with Variable Background",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting and tracking objects
in videos with variable background i.e. videos captured by moving cameras
without any additional sensor. In a video captured by a moving camera, both the
background and foreground are changing in each frame of the image sequence. So
for these videos, modeling a single background with traditional background
modeling methods is infeasible and thus the detection of actual moving object
in a variable background is a challenging task. To detect actual moving object
in this work, spatio-temporal blobs have been generated in each frame by
spatio-temporal analysis of the image sequence using a three-dimensional Gabor
filter. Then individual blobs, which are parts of one object are merged using
Minimum Spanning Tree to form the moving object in the variable background. The
height, width and four-bin gray-value histogram of the object are calculated as
its features and an object is tracked in each frame using these features to
generate the trajectories of the object through the video sequence. In this
work, problem of data association during tracking is solved by Linear
Assignment Problem and occlusion is handled by the application of kalman
filter. The major advantage of our method over most of the existing tracking
algorithms is that, the proposed method does not require initialization in the
first frame or training on sample data to perform. Performance of the algorithm
has been tested on benchmark videos and very satisfactory result has been
achieved. The performance of the algorithm is also comparable and superior with
respect to some benchmark algorithms.

forward error correction (SD-FEC) with bit interleaving over the bit channels.
The generalized mutual information (GMI) is an achievable information rate
(AIR) in such systems and is known to be a good predictor of the bit error rate
after SD-FEC decoding (post-FEC BER) for uniform signaling. However, for
probabilistically shaped (nonuniform) signaling, we find that the normalized
AIR, defined as the AIR divided by the signal entropy, is less correlated with
the post-FEC BER. We show that the information quantity based on the
distribution of the single bit signal, and its asymmetric loglikelihood ratio,
are better predictors of the post-FEC BER. In simulations over the Gaussian
channel, we find that the prediction accuracy, quantified as the peak-to-peak
deviation of the post-FEC BER within a set of different modulation formats and
distributions, can be improved more than 10 times compared with the normalized
AIR.

  continuation, numerical algebraic geometry",,,,"math.OC math.AG math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled
oscillators and enjoys successful application in a wide variety of fields. Many
of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the
model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of
oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More
recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical
engineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be
located by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations
utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for
solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real
solutions give equilibria. In this paper, we present an algorithm to locate
only the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation time by
several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by
choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic
decoupling of the system. The correctness of the algorithm (that it finds only
and all the equilibria) is proved rigorously. Additionally, the algorithm can
be implemented using interval methods so that the equilibria can be
approximated up to any given precision without significantly more computational
effort. We also compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic
geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove,
asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as
the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally,
we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number
of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of
explicitly provided natural frequencies.
