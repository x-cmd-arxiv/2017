by Bettinelli and Miermont as scaling limits of quadrangulations with a
boundary when the boundary size tends to infinity. Our method is very similar
to the construction of the Brownian map, but it makes use of the positive
excursion measure of the Brownian snake which has been introduced recently.
This excursion measure involves a random continuous tree whose vertices are
assigned nonnegative labels, which correspond to distances from the boundary in
our approach to the Brownian disk. We provide several applications of our
construction. In particular, we prove that the uniform measure on the boundary
can be obtained as the limit of the suitably normalized volume measure on a
small tubular neighborhood of the boundary. We also prove that connected
components of the complement of the Brownian net are Brownian disks, as it was
suggested in the recent work of Miller and Sheffield. Finally, we show that
connected components of the complement of balls centered at the distinguished
point of the Brownian map are independent Brownian disks, conditionally on
their volumes and perimeters.

EviPlant is a system designed for the efficient creation, manipulation, storage

The system relies on the initial distribution of base disk images, i.e., images
containing solely base operating systems. In order to create challenges for
students, educators can boot the base system, emulate the desired activity and
perform a ""diffing"" of resultant image and the base image. This diffing process
extracts the modified artefacts and associated metadata and stores them in an
""evidence package"". Evidence packages can be created for different personae,
different wear-and-tear, different emulated crimes, etc., and multiple evidence
packages can be distributed to students and integrated into the base images. A
number of additional applications in digital forensic challenge creation for
tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, and malware analysis are also

clusters and fundamental parameters of the cosmological models. In this work,
we determine the dependence of the the SZ surface brightness amplitude with
redshift and mass of the clusters. We have used PLANCK+IRAS data in the
microwave-far infrared and a catalog with >10^5 clusters of galaxies extracted
from the SDSS by Wen et al. (2012). We estimate and subtract the dust emission
from those clusters. From the residual flux, we extract its SZ flux densities.
  The absolute value of the SZ amplitude indicates that the gas mass is around
10% of the total mass for cluster masses of M~10^{14} M_sun. This amplitude is
compatible with no evolution with redshift and proportional to M^{2.70+/-0.37}
(using X-ray derived masses) or M^{2.51+/-0.38} (using weak-lensing derived
masses), with some tension regarding the expectations of the self-similar
dependence (amplitude proportional to M^{5/3}).
  Other secondary products of our analysis include that clusters have a dust
emission with emissivity index beta~2 and temperature T~25 K; we confirm that
the CMB temperature agrees with a dependence of T_0(1+z) with clusters of much
lower mass than those explored previously; and we find that the cluster masses
derived by Wen et al. (2012) from a richness-mass relationship are biased by a
factor of (1+z)^{-1.8} with respect to the X-ray and weak-lensing measurements.

Galactic structures of an elongated bar and spiral arms, gas clouds in the disk
inflow to the nuclear region and form a central molecular zone (CMZ)-like

of gas inflow to the nuclear region is equilibrated to ~0.02 M_sun/yr. The
nuclear ring is off-centered, relative to the Galactic center, by the lopsided
central mass distribution of the Galaxy model, and thus an asymmetric mass
distribution of the nuclear ring arises accordingly. The vertical asymmetry of

The DMC formation energies of the oxygen vacancy in SrFeO${_3}$ and LaFeO${_3}$
under oxygen-rich conditions are 1.3(1) and 6.24(7) eV, respectively. Similar
calculations with semi-local DFT approximations for LaFeO$_3$ yielded vacancy
formation energies 1.5 eV lower. Comparison of charge density evaluated with
DMC and DFT approximations shows that DFT tends to overdelocalize the electrons
in defected SrFeO${_3}$ and LaFeO${_3}$. Calculations with DMC and LDA yield
similar vacancy migration energy barriers, indicating that steric/electrostatic
effects mainly determine migration barriers in these materials.

11 year cycle, modulating the radiation and charged particle environment
experienced by the Earth as ""space weather"". Decades of observations from the
Mount Wilson Observatory have revealed that other stars also show regular
activity cycles in their Ca II H+K line emission, and identified two different
relationships between the length of the cycle and the rotation rate of the
star. Recent observations at higher cadence have allowed the discovery of
shorter cycles with periods between 1-3 yr. Some of these shorter cycles
coexist with longer cycle periods, suggesting that two underlying dynamos can
operate simultaneously. We combine these new observations with previous data,
and we show that the longer and shorter cycle periods agree remarkably well
with those expected from an earlier analysis based on the mean activity level
and the rotation period. The relative turbulent length scales associated with
the two branches of cyclic behavior suggest that a near-surface dynamo may be
the dominant mechanism that drives cycles in more active stars, whereas a
dynamo operating in deeper layers may dominate in less active stars. However,
several examples of equally prominent long and short cycles have been found at
all levels of activity of stars younger than 2.3 Gyr. Deviations from the
expected cycle periods show no dependence on the depth of the convection zone
or on the metallicity. For some stars that exhibit longer cycles, we compute
the periods of shorter cycles that might be detected with future high-cadence
observations.

address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In particular, greedy algorithms
that exploit current estimates without any exploration may be sub-optimal in
general. However, exploration-free greedy algorithms are desirable in practical
settings where exploration may be costly or unethical (e.g., clinical trials).
Surprisingly, we find that a simple greedy algorithm can be rate optimal
(achieves asymptotically optimal regret) if there is sufficient randomness in
the observed contexts (covariates). We prove that this is always the case for a
two-armed bandit under a general class of context distributions that satisfy a
condition we term covariate diversity. Furthermore, even absent this condition,
we show that a greedy algorithm can be rate optimal with positive probability.
Thus, standard bandit algorithms may unnecessarily explore. Motivated by these
results, we introduce Greedy-First, a new algorithm that uses only observed
contexts and rewards to determine whether to follow a greedy algorithm or to
explore. We prove that this algorithm is rate optimal without any additional
assumptions on the context distribution or the number of arms. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that Greedy-First successfully reduces exploration and
outperforms existing (exploration-based) contextual bandit algorithms such as
Thompson sampling or upper confidence bound (UCB).

particular driving dynamics.
  Although limiting to GWW, SSMC is more general. We show that (1) GWW can be

faster than GWW, (3) by naturally incorporating structural information, SSMC
can exponentially outperform the quantum algorithm that first inspired it, and
(4) SSMC exhibits desirable search features in general spaces. Our approach
combines ideas from genetic algorithms (GWW), theoretical probability
(Fleming-Viot processes), and quantum computing. Not only do we demonstrate

understanding, analysis and treatment of galvanic distortion of the electric
field in the Magnetotelluric (MT) method. We build upon a recently formulated
impedance tensor decomposition into the known Phase Tensor and an Amplitude
Tensor that is shown to be complementary and algebraically independent of the
Phase Tensor. This recent decomposition demonstrates that the Amplitude Tensor
contains inductive and galvanic information of the subsurface and that the
inductive information is physically coupled to the one contained in the Phase
Tensor. In this work we present an algorithm that employs this last finding to
show that the MT galvanic electric distortion tensor can be separated from the
inductive Amplitude Tensor and hence, that this distortion can be recovered for
any given data up to a single constant usually denoted as galvanic shift.
Firstly, to illustrate distortion effects on the Amplitude Tensor, we manually
apply distortion by matrix multiplication to synthetic impedance tensor data.
Then, we use the observations of that analysis to define an objective function,
which minimises when there is no distortion present in the Amplitude Tensor.
Secondly, we describe our algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm to find
the optimal distortion tensor needed to correct the Amplitude Tensor, and
therewith the impedance tensor. Lastly, we test the performance of the proposed
methodology on synthetic data of known distortion and random distortion, and on
four real data sets. The real data sets, lit007/lit008 and lit901/lit902,
demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm by revealing geological
expected results in the impedance data for the first time, which could not be
achieved before by alternative methods.

We describe a meshless method based on nearest-neighbour interpolation that
significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to discretise
the unknown traction, increasing the range of problems that can practically
solved, without excessively complicating the task of the modeller. The
nearest-neighbour technique is tested against the classical problem of rigid

more complex biophysical problem of calculating the diffusion timescales of a

where the goal is to converge on an optimal action in a manner that limits
exploration costs. One shortcoming imposed by this orientation is that it does
not treat time preference in a coherent manner. Time preference plays an
important role when the optimal action is costly to learn relative to
near-optimal actions. This limitation has not only restricted the relevance of
theoretical results but has also influenced the design of algorithms. Indeed,
popular approaches such as Thompson sampling and UCB can fare poorly in such
situations. In this paper, we consider discounted rather than cumulative
regret, where a discount factor encodes time preference. We propose satisficing
Thompson sampling -- a variation of Thompson sampling -- and establish a strong
discounted regret bound for this new algorithm.

those with a similar stellar mass but residing in dynamically old (relaxed)

offsets in the range 0.2-2.5 kpc between the photometric centres of the stellar
disc and stellar bar. The measured offsets correlate with global asymmetries of
the galaxies, with those with largest offsets showing higher lopsidedness.
These findings are in good agreement with predictions from simulations of
dwarf-dwarf tidal interactions producing off-centre bars. We find that the
majority of galaxies with off-centre bars are of Magellanic type, with a median
mass of $10^{9.6} M_{\odot}$, and 91% of them having $M_{\star}<3\times10^{10}
M_{\odot}$, the characteristic mass at which galaxies start having higher
central concentrations attributed to the presence of bulges. We conduct a
search for companions to test the hypothesis of tidal interactions, but find
that a similar fraction of galaxies with offset bars have companions within 100
kpc as galaxies with centred bars. Although this may be due to the
incompleteness of the SDSS spectroscopic survey at the faint end, alternative
scenarios that give rise to offset bars such as interactions with dark
companions or the effect of lopsided halo potentials should be considered.
Future observations are needed to confirm possible low mass companion
candidates and to determine the shape of the dark matter halo, in order to find
the explanation for the off-centre bars in these galaxies.

sharply, but are concave rather than convex. By comparing to simulations of gas
sloshing, we find that the bay in the Perseus cluster bears a striking
resemblance in its size, location and thermal structure, to a giant

the morphology of this structure can be compared to simulations to put
constraints on the initial average ratio of the thermal and magnetic pressure,
$\beta= p_{\rm th} / p_{\rm B}$, throughout the overall cluster before the
sloshing occurs, for which we find $\beta=200$ to best match the observations.
Simulations with a stronger magnetic field ($\beta=100$) are disfavoured, as in
these the large Kelvin-Helmholtz rolls do not form, while in simulations with a
lower magnetic field ($\beta=500$) the level of instabilities is much larger

boundary of a $(d+1)-$dimensional bulk state, and the lattice symmetry of the
spin system acts as an on-site symmetry in the field theory that describes both

state of the $(d+1)-$dimensional bulk. If the symmetry action of the field
theory is nonanomalous, i.e. the corresponding bulk state is a trivial state
instead of a bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) state, then a
featureless ground state of the spin system is allowed; if the corresponding
bulk state is indeed a nontrivial SPT state, then it likely excludes the
existence of a featureless ground state of the spin system. From this
perspective we identify the spin systems with SU($N$) and SO($N$) symmetries on
one, two and three dimensional lattices that permit a featureless ground state.

distance between sites can be very relevant, e.g., those cases where it is
intended to minimize costs. Within this scenario we studied the role of

including tissue development, repair, and tumor formation. Recent experiments
have shown that certain malignant cancer cells form clusters in a
chemoattractant gradient, which display three different phases of motion:
translational, rotational, and random. Intriguingly, all three phases are
observed simultaneously, with clusters spontaneously switching between these
modes of motion. The origin of this behavior is not understood at present,
especially the robust appearance of cluster rotations. Guided by experiments on
the motion of two-dimensional clusters in-vitro, we developed an agent based
model in which the cells form a cohesive cluster due to attractive and
alignment interactions but with potentially different behaviors based on their
local environment. We find that when cells at the cluster rim are more motile,
all three phases of motion coexist, in excellent agreement with the
observations. Using the model we can identify that the transitions between
different phases are driven by a competition between an ordered rim and a
disordered core accompanied by the creation and annihilation of topological
defects in the velocity field. The model makes definite predictions regarding
the dependence of the motility phase of the cluster on its size and external
chemical gradient, which agree with our experimental data. Our results suggest
that heterogeneous behavior of individuals, based on local environment, can
lead to novel, experimentally observed phases of collective motion.

contributes up to 30\% of the ionizing photons responsible for reionization.
These are low mass halos in the range $M_h =10^{6.5}-10^{8} M_{\odot}$ that
have been chemically enriched by supernova ejecta from prior Pop III star
formation. Despite their low star formation rates, these Metal Cooling halos
(MCs) are significant sources of ionizing radiation, especially at the onset of
reionization, due to their high number density and ionizing escape fractions.
Here we present a fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamic simulation of
reionization that includes these MCs as well the more massive hydrogen atomic
line cooling halos. Our method is novel: we perform halo finding inline with
the radiation hydrodynamical simulation, and assign escaping ionizing fluxes to
halos using a probability distribution function (PDF) measured from the
galaxy-resolving Renaissance Simulations. The PDF captures the mass dependence
of the ionizing escape fraction as well as the probability that a halo is
actively forming stars. With MCs, reionization starts earlier than if only
halos of $10^8 M_{\odot}$ and above are included, however the redshift when
reionization completes is only marginally affected as this is driven by more
massive galaxies. Because star formation is intermittent in MCs, the earliest
phase of reionization exhibits a stochastic nature, with small H II regions
forming and recombining. Only later, once halos of mass $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$
and above begin to dominate the ionizing emissivity, does reionization proceed
smoothly in the usual manner deduced from previous studies. This occurs at
$z\approx 10$ in our simulation.

single nanotubes, comparing dispersed/suspended material. Combining high

pin-point emission origin to a scale of less than 20 nm, giving us a one-to-one
validation of emission source with dimensions smaller than the laser excitation

hybrid/entwined BNNT. By artificially curving h-BN flakes, similar QE spectral
features are observed. The impact on emission of solvents used in commercial

precision engineering of QEs, puts h-BN under a similar 'umbrella' of TMDC's
QEs and provides a model explaining QEs spatial localization/formation using
electron/ion irradiation and chemical etching.

calibrate an empirical mass-richness relation for the combined sample spanning
more than one decade in cluster mass and find the associated uncertainties in

the repeater by introducing a series of benchmarks. The benchmarks, which
should be surpassed to claim a working repeater, are based on finite-energy
considerations, thermal noise and the losses in the setup. In order to boost
the performance of the studied repeaters we introduce two methods. The first
one corresponds to the concept of a cut-off, which reduces the effect of
decoherence during storage of a quantum state by introducing a maximum storage
time. Secondly, we supplement the standard classical post-processing with an
advantage distillation procedure. Using these methods, we find realistic
parameters for which it is possible to achieve rates greater than each of the

recently published VLA observations of young stars with core properties
obtained from SCUBA-2 observations at 850 um. Most embedded binary systems are
found toward the centres of their parent cores, although several systems have
components closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined as those systems
with physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned
with the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no
preferred orientation. We test a number of simple, evolutionary models to
account for the observed populations of Class 0 and I sources, both single and
binary. In the model that best explains the observations, all stars form
initially as wide binaries. These binaries either break up into separate stars
or else shrink into tighter orbits. Under the assumption that both stars remain
embedded following binary breakup, we find a total star formation rate of 168
Myr^-1. Alternatively, one star may be ejected from the dense core due to
binary breakup. This latter assumption results in a star formation rate of 247
Myr^-1. Both production rates are in satisfactory agreement with current
estimates from other studies of Perseus. Future observations should be able to
distinguish between these two possibilities. If our model continues to provide
a good fit to other star-forming regions, then the mass fraction of dense cores
that becomes stars is double what is currently believed.

generate uninterpretable results. Our insight is to model the forecasting
problem at a higher level of abstraction. Specifically, we exploit human pose
detectors as a free source of supervision and break the video forecasting
problem into two discrete steps. First we explicitly model the high level
structure of active objects in the scene---humans---and use a VAE to model the
possible future movements of humans in the pose space. We then use the future
poses generated as conditional information to a GAN to predict the future
frames of the video in pixel space. By using the structured space of pose as an
intermediate representation, we sidestep the problems that GANs have in
generating video pixels directly. We show through quantitative and qualitative
evaluation that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for video
prediction.

parameter-dependent Lyapunov function yielding stability conditions under both
constant and minimum dwell-times. Interesting adaptations of the latter result
consist of a minimum dwell-time stability condition for uncertain LPV systems
and LPV switched impulsive systems. The minimum dwell-time stability condition
is notably shown to naturally generalize and unify the well-known quadratic and
robust stability criteria all together. Those conditions are then adapted to
address the stabilization problem via timer-dependent and a timer- and/or
parameter-independent (i.e. robust) state-feedback controllers, the latter
being obtained from a relaxed minimum dwell-time stability condition involving
slack-variables. Finally, the last part addresses the stability of LPV systems
with jumps under a range dwell-time condition which is then used to provide
stabilization conditions for LPV systems using a sampled-data state-feedback
gain-scheduled controller. The obtained stability and stabilization conditions
are all formulated as infinite-dimensional semidefinite programming problems
which are then solved using sum of squares programming. Examples are given for
illustration.

allows T2K to measure cross sections for anti-neutrinos at an energy around 600
MeV using the off-axis near detector. These measurements, along with the
analogous for neutrinos, are vital inputs to neutrino oscillation analyses and
their interpretation. In this work preliminary results on the simultaneous

important at large chemical potential but also leaves a significant imprint on
the dynamics at small chemical potential as measured by the curvature of the

nova-like outburst around 1850. After 165 years, during June of 2015, it
erupted again showing characteristics of the Z And-type outburst. The primary
objective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the
2015 outburst of AG Peg. We achieved this aim by modelling the spectral energy
distribution using low-resolution spectroscopy (330-750 nm), medium-resolution
spectroscopy (420-720 nm; R=11000), and $UBVR_{\rm C}I_{\rm C}$ photometry
covering the 2015 outburst with a high cadence. Optical observations were
complemented with the archival HST and FUSE spectra from the preceding
quiescence. During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the
range of 2-11$\times 10^{37}(d/0.8{\rm kpc})^2$ erg/s. To generate the maximum
luminosity the white dwarf (WD) had to accrete at $\sim 3\times 10^{-7}$
M$_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, which exceeds the stable-burning limit and thus led to
blowing optically thick wind from the WD. We determined its mass-loss rate to a
few $\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}yr^{-1}$. At the high temperature of the
ionising source, $1.5-2.3\times 10^5$ K, the wind converted a fraction of the
WD's photospheric radiation into the nebular emission that dominated the
optical. A one order of magnitude increase of the emission measure, from a few
$\times 10^{59}(d/0.8 {\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during quiescence, to a few
$\times 10^{60}(d/0.8\,{\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during the outburst, caused a 2
mag brightening in the LC, which is classified as the Z And-type of the
outburst. The very high nebular emission and the presence of a disk-like HI
region encompassing the WD, as indicated by a significant broadening and high
flux of the Raman-scattered OVI 6825 \AA\ line during the outburst, is
consistent with the ionisation structure of hot components in symbiotic stars
during active phases.

of this objective function is a rational fraction, where the numerator item is
the least square error and the denominator item is the square of the scale
factor. By imposing the emphasis on scale factor, the ill-posed problem can be
avoided in the scaling registration. Subsequently, the new objective function
can be solved by the proposed scaling iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm,
which can obtain the optimal scaling transformation. For the practical
applications, the scaling ICP algorithm is further extended to align partially
overlapping point sets. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on public data
sets and applied to merging grid maps of different resolutions. Experimental
results demonstrate its superiority over previous approaches on efficiency and
robustness.

guarantee of safety, but this can be impractical to ensure in real-time when
the vehicle is described with a high-fidelity model. To address this problem,
this paper develops a method to perform trajectory design by considering a
low-fidelity model that accounts for model mismatch. The presented method
begins by computing a conservative Forward Reachable Set (FRS) of a
high-fidelity model's trajectories produced when tracking trajectories of a
low-fidelity model over a finite time horizon. At runtime, the vehicle
intersects this FRS with obstacles in the environment to eliminate trajectories
that can lead to a collision, then selects an optimal plan from the remaining
safe set. By bounding the time for this set intersection and subsequent path
selection, this paper proves a lower bound for the FRS time horizon and sensing
horizon to guarantee safety. This method is demonstrated in simulation using a
kinematic Dubin's car as the low-fidelity model and a dynamic unicycle as the
high-fidelity model.

common to quantify the impact of these uncertainties through a global
sensitivity metric, which is then used to identify specific nuclides that would
be most worthwhile to measure experimentally. Using descriptive statistics, we
assess a set of metrics used in previous sensitivity studies, as well as a new
logarithmic measure. For certain neutron-rich nuclides lying near the r-process
path for the typical hot-wind scenario, we find opposing conclusions on their
relative sensitivity implied by different metrics, although they all generally
agree which ones are the most sensitive nuclei. The underlying reason is that
sensitivity metrics which simply sum over variations in the r-process
distribution depend on the scaling used in the baseline, which often varies
between simulations. We show that normalization of the abundances causes
changes in the reported sensitivity factors and recommend reporting a minimized
F statistic in addition to a scale estimation for rough calibration to be used
when comparing tables of sensitivity factors from different studies.

rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization structure of up to three
distinct polarized emission regions or 'RM components' of a source. Overall,
37%/52%/11% of sources are best fit by one/two/three RM components. However,
these fractions are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in
polarization (more RM components more likely at higher S/N). In general, our
analysis shows that sources with high integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4
GHz have low Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single RM
component, have a steep spectral index, and a high intrinsic degree of
polarization. After classifying our sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode
AGN, we find no significant difference between the Faraday rotation or Faraday
depolarization properties of jet-mode and radiative-mode AGN. However, there is
a statistically significant difference in the intrinsic degree of polarization
between the two types, with the jet-mode sources having more intrinsically
ordered magnetic field structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find

a Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and

losses that control the ability of the model to maintain the ordering over the

dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The
proposed model is by nature suitable for implicit feedback and involves the
estimation of only very few parameters. Through extensive experiments on
several real-world benchmarks on implicit data, we show the interest of
learning the preference and the embedding simultaneously when compared to
learning those separately. We also demonstrate that our approach is very

individual differences in creativity, and observed a trade-off between the
ratio of creators to imitators, and how creative the creators were. Excess
creativity was detrimental because creators invested in unproven ideas at the
expense of propagating proven ones. Experiment Two tested the hypothesis that
society as a whole benefits if individuals adjust how creative they are in
accordance with their creative success. When effective creators created more,
and ineffective creators created less (social regulation), the agents
segregated into creators and imitators, and the mean fitness of outputs was
temporarily higher. We hypothesized that the temporary nature of the effect was
due to a ceiling on output fitness. In Experiment Three we made the space of
possible outputs open-ended by giving agents the capacity to chain simple
outputs into arbitrarily complex ones such that fitter outputs were always

evaluate the performance of a trading strategy. We describe a framework for
single-period optimization, where the trades in each period are found by
solving a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk,
transaction cost and holding cost such as the borrowing cost for shorting
assets. We then describe a multi-period version of the trading method, where
optimization is used to plan a sequence of trades, with only the first one
executed, using estimates of future quantities that are unknown when the trades
are chosen. The single-period method traces back to Markowitz; the multi-period
methods trace back to model predictive control. Our contribution is to describe
the single-period and multi-period methods in one simple framework, giving a
clear description of the development and the approximations made. In this paper
we do not address a critical component in a trading algorithm, the predictions
or forecasts of future quantities. The methods we describe in this paper can be
thought of as good ways to exploit predictions, no matter how they are made. We
have also developed a companion open-source software library that implements
many of the ideas and methods described in the paper.

rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. These measurements suggest that
Nb$_{0.5}$Os$_{0.5}$ is a weakly coupled ($\lambda_{e-ph}$ $\sim$ 0.53) type-II
superconductor ($\kappa_{GL}$ $\approx$ 61) having a bulk superconducting
transition temperature $T_c$ = 3.07 K. The specific heat data in the
superconductive regime fits well with the single-gap BCS model indicating
nodeless s-wave superconductivity in Nb$_{0.5}$Os$_{0.5}$. The $\mu$SR
measurements also confirm $\textit{s}$-wave superconductivity with the
preserved time-reversal symmetry.

charged nanopore grafted with ionomer sidechains. The pore surface is
hydrophobic and its diameter is varied from 2.0 nm to 3.7 nm. The sidechains
have from 2 to 16 monomers (united atom units) and contain sulfonate terminal
groups.
  Our simulation results indicate a strong dependence of the ion diffusion
along the pore axis on the pore parameters. In the case of short sidechains and
large pores the ions mostly occupy the pore wall area, where their distribution
is strongly disturbed by their host sulfonates. In the case of short sidechains
and narrow pores, the mobility of ions is strongly affected by the structuring
and polarization effects of the water molecules. In the case of long
sidechains, and when the sidechain sulfonates reach the pore center, a radial
charge separation occurs in the pore. Such charge separation suppresses the ion
diffusion along the pore axis.
  An enhanced ion diffusion was found in the pores grafted with medium-size
sidechains provided that the ions do not enter the central pore area, and the
water is less structured around the ions and sulfonates. In this case, the 3D
density of the ions has a hollow-cylinder type shape with a smooth and
uninterrupted surface. We found that the maximal ion diffusion has a linear
dependence on the number of sidechain monomers. It is suggested that the
maximal ion diffusion along the pore axis is attained if the effective length
of the sidechain extension into the pore center (measured as twice the gyration
radius of the sidechain with the Flory exponent 1/4) is about 1/3 of the pore
radius.

combines the concept of opportunistic execution with hierarchical scheduling to

the preceding study, a unique global weak solution to the Euler-$\alpha$
equations, which is a regularized Euler equations, for point-vortex initial
data is considered, and thereby it has been shown that, as $\alpha \rightarrow
0$, the evolution of three point vortices converges to a self-similar
collapsing orbit dissipating the enstrophy in the sense of distributions at the
critical time. In the present paper, to elucidate whether or not this singular
orbit can be constructed independently on the regularization method, we
consider a functional generalization of the Euler-$\alpha$ equations, called
the \textit{Euler-Poincar\'{e} models}, in which the incompressible velocity
field is dispersively regularized by a smoothing function. We provide a
sufficient condition for the existence of the singular orbit, which is
applicable to many smoothing functions. As examples, we confirm that the
condition is satisfied with the Gaussian regularization and the vortex-blob
regularization that are both utilized in the numerical scheme solving the Euler
equations. Consequently, the enstrophy dissipation via the collapse of three
point vortices is a generic phenomenon that is not specific to the
Euler-$\alpha$ equations but universal within the Euler-Poincar\'{e} models.

field theory, we explore the properties of this model for frustrated transverse
exchange. We find not one, but three, competing forms of spin liquid, as well
as a phase with hidden, spin-nematic, order. We explore the experimental
signatures of each of these different states, making explicit predictions for
inelastic neutron scattering. These results show an intriguing similarity to
experiments on a range of pyrochlore oxides.

variables in the model are the concentrations of phosphorylation states of the
T cell receptor complex and the phosphatase SHP-1 in the cell. It is shown that
these quantities cannot approach zero and that the model possesses more than
one positive steady state for certain values of the parameters. It can also
exhibit damped oscillations. It is proved that the chemical concentration which
represents the degree of activation of the cell, that of the maximally
phosphorylated form of the T cell receptor complex, is in general a
non-monotone function of the activating signal. In particular there are cases
where there is a value of the dissociation constant of the ligand from the
receptor which produces an optimal activation of the T cell. In this way the
results of certain simulations in the literature have been confirmed rigorously
and some important features which had not previously been seen have been
discovered.

quantum information processing tasks, ranging from quantum imaging and sensing

to almost every potential application is an efficient mechanism for the high

such readout has been achieved through an optically resonant fluorescence
measurement, but the presence of decay through a meta-stable state will limit
its efficiency to the order of 99%. While this is good enough for many

smaller than the degree of saturation of ${\mathfrak C}$), providing an
explicit bound on this size. Next, we prove that these Ellis groups do not

quadratic-bilinear (QB) systems. Balanced truncation for linear systems mainly
involves the computation of the Gramians of the system, namely reachability and
observability Gramians. These Gramians are extended to a general nonlinear
setting in Scherpen (1993), where it is shown that Gramians for nonlinear
systems are the solutions of state-dependent nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi
equations. Therefore, they are not only difficult to compute for large-scale
systems but also hard to utilize in the model reduction framework. In this
paper, we propose algebraic Gramians for QB systems based on the underlying
Volterra series representation of QB systems and their Hilbert adjoint systems.
We then show their relations with a certain type of generalized quadratic
Lyapunov equation. Furthermore, we present how these algebraic Gramians and
energy functionals relate to each other. Moreover, we characterize the
reachability and observability of QB systems based on the proposed algebraic
Gramians. This allows us to find those states that are hard to control and hard
to observe via an appropriate transformation based on the Gramians. Truncating
such states yields reduced-order systems. Additionally, we present a truncated
version of the Gramians for QB systems and discuss their advantages in the
model reduction framework. We also investigate the Lyapunov stability of the
reduced-order systems. We finally illustrate the efficiency of the proposed
balancing-type model reduction for QB systems by means of various
semi-discretized nonlinear partial differential equations and show its
competitiveness with the existing moment-matching methods for QB systems.

seeks the optimal transportation scheme to move material from a given initial
to a final distribution. The cost of the scheme encodes a higher transport
efficiency the more mass is moved together, which automatically leads to
optimal transportation networks with a hierarchical branching structure. The
two major existing model formulations, either using mass fluxes (vector-valued
measures) or patterns (probabilities on the space of particle paths), are
rather different. Once their equivalence was established, the analysis of
optimal networks could rest on both.
  The transportation cost of classical branched transport is a fractional power
of the transported mass, and several model properties and proof techniques
build on its strict concavity. We generalize the model and its analysis to the
most general class of reasonable transportation costs, essentially increasing,
subadditive functions. This requires several modifications or new approaches.
In particular, for the equivalence between mass flux and pattern formulation it
turns out advantageous to resort to a description via 1-currents, an intuition
which already Xia exploited. In addition, some already existing arguments are
given a more concise and perhaps simpler form. The analysis includes the
well-posedness, a metrization and a length space property of the model cost,
the equivalence between the different model formulations, as well as a few

morphism $\sigma: \mathcal{A}^* \to \mathcal{B}^*$. Full recognizability occurs
when each (aperiodic) point in $\mathcal{B}^\mathbb{Z}$ admits at most one
tiling with words $\sigma(a)$, $a \in \mathcal{A}$. This is stronger than the
classical notion of recognizability of a substitution $\sigma:
\mathcal{A}^*\to\mathcal{A}^*$, where the tiling must be compatible with the
language of the substitution. We show that if $|\mathcal A|=2$, or if
$\sigma$'s incidence matrix has rank $|\mathcal A|$, or if $\sigma$ is
permutative, then $\sigma$ is fully recognizable. Next we investigate the
classical notion of recognizability and improve earlier results of Moss\'{e}
(1992) and Bezuglyi, Kwiatkowski and Medynets (2009), by showing that any
substitution is recognizable for aperiodic points in its substitutive shift.
Finally we define recognizability and also eventual recognizability for
sequences of morphisms which define an $S$-adic shift. We prove that a sequence
of morphisms on alphabets of bounded size, such that compositions of
consecutive morphisms are growing on all letters, is eventually recognizable
for aperiodic points. We provide examples of eventually recognizable, but not
recognizable, sequences of morphisms, and sequences of morphisms which are not
eventually recognizable. As an application, for a recognizable sequence of
morphisms, we obtain an almost everywhere bijective correspondence between the

to the parameters of a molecular model of uniaxial nematics, which we take to
be a lattice gas model of nematogenic molecules interacting via a short-ranged
potential. We obtain general constraints on the temperature and volume fraction
of nematogens for the Landau-de Gennes theory to be stable against molecular
orientation fluctuations at quartic order. In particular, for the case of a
fully occupied lattice, we compute the values of the isotropic-nematic
transition temperature and the order parameter discontinuity predicted by (i) a
continuum approximation of the nearest-neighbor Lebwohl-Lasher model and (ii) a
Lebwohl-Lasher-type model with a nematogenic interaction of finite range. We
find that the predictions of (i) are in reasonably good agreement with known

nonlinear state-space modeling for hysteresis identification has provided
promising results, but struggles with a large number of parameters due to the
use of multivariate polynomials. This drawback is tackled in the current paper
by applying a decoupling approach that results in a more parsimonious
representation involving univariate polynomials. This work is carried out
numerically on input-output data generated by a Bouc-Wen hysteretic model and
follows up on earlier work of the authors. The current article discusses the
polynomial decoupling approach and explores the selection of the number of

in the case of the small phonon frequency corresponding to the adiabatic
condition, the first stage of the CO melting dynamics occurs due to the energy
transfer from the fermionic to phononic systems, and the second stage is

durable and impactful, while weak attitudes are fluctuating and
inconsequential. Recently, the Causal Attitude Network (CAN) model was proposed
as a comprehensive measurement model of attitudes, which conceptualizes
attitudes as networks of causally connected evaluative reactions (i.e.,
beliefs, feelings, and behavior toward an attitude object). Here, we test the
central postulate of the CAN model that highly connected attitude networks
correspond to strong attitudes. We use data from the American National Election
Studies 1980-2012 on attitudes toward presidential candidates (total n =
18,795). We first show that political interest predicts connectivity of
attitude networks toward presidential candidates. Second, we show that
connectivity is strongly related to two defining features of strong attitudes -
stability of the attitude and the attitude's impact on behavior. We conclude
that network theory provides a promising framework to advance the understanding
of attitude strength.

In contrast to particles with spherical shape, we show that elongated colloids

Remarkably, this can translate into a non-vanishing thermophoretic force in the
direction perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Oppositely to the friction
force, the thermophoretic force of a rod oriented with the temperature gradient
can be larger or smaller than when oriented perpendicular to it. The precise

high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of gaseous nebulae reveals that
previous discrepancies found between theory and observation are not fully
resolved by the latest atomic data. Blending is ruled out as a likely cause of
the discrepancies, because temperature- and density-independent ratios (arising
from lines with common upper levels) match well with those predicted by theory.
For a typical nebular plasma with electron temperature $T_{\rm e} = 9000$ K and
electron density $\rm N_{e}=10^4 \, cm^{-3}$, cascading of electrons from the
levels $\rm ^3G_5$, $\rm ^3G_4$ and $\rm ^3G_3$ plays an important role in
determining the populations of lower levels, such as $\rm ^3F_4$, which provide
the density diagnostic emission lines of Fe III, such as $\rm ^5D_4$ - $\rm
^3F_4$ at 4658 \AA. Hence further work on the A-values for these transitions is
recommended, ideally including measurements if possible. However, some Fe III
ratios do provide reliable $N_{\rm e}$-diagnostics, such as 4986/4658. The Fe
III cooling function calculated with Cloudy using the most recent atomic data
is found to be significantly greater at $T_e$ $\simeq$ 30000 K than predicted
with the existing Cloudy model. This is due to the presence of additional
emission lines with the new data, particularly in the 1000--4000 \AA\

type equations based on the series expansion method are presented. Various
examples are introduced and discussed. The recurrence relation for the
components of the approximate solution is constructed. In the standard integer
order derivative, it is shown that the results are the same as those obtained
by Adomian decomposition method, homotopy perturbation method, modified Laplace
decomposition method and variational iteration method.

Novikov-Borodin","Ontological Systems In Cognition","pages 1-16 in English and pages 16-31 in Russian",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are investigated the generalized methods of cognition of the Existing,
i.e. everything that is able to influence to the cognizer, and everything
differed from the Existing is postulated as indistinguishable from the
non-existing and incognizable. The traditional methods of cognition, based on
the identification of the objects of the surrounding world, take into account
not all influences, because are limited by the nature, understood as the
ontology of the subject of cognition. The ontology is determined on the level
of basic notions and definitions, so even if objects from the representation
systems different by ontology are identified, they look undetermined, uncertain
and paradoxical, exactly as, for example, the quantum mechanical objects or
cosmological dark matter and energy. The representation systems with different
ontology are incompatible with each other on the level of basic notions and
cannot be unified on frames of one consistent system or theory. The concept of
incompatible representations unifies on the level exceeded the ontological
frames the different by ontology representation systems and incompatible
approaches, such as relativistic and quantum ones. The concept gives a
possibility to eliminate the principal contradictions of the system approach in
scientific cognition, so solves the problem of understanding in science. The
generalized methods of cognition are by definition on the foundations of
different representation systems: scientific, philosophical, religious and
social ones, what gives a possibility of general analysis and revision of their
foundations. The interconnections of some physical theories, the philosophical,
religious and social systems are briefly analyzed from this point of view.
There are briefly considered the multi-polar picture of the world, which the
concept of incompatible representations leads to.
