is quadratic. The other algorithm is based on the novel notion of
gcd-partitions and has a linear worst case running time. If the eventuality
sequence pair (W,z) is a gcd-partition for the double recurrence (x, y),then,
from a certain property of gcd-partitions, within any cycle of the double
recurrence, there exists r and s such that intervals of occurrence of xp and yq
are non-disjoint with the interval of co-occurrence of wr and zs. As such, a
coincidence between xp and yq occurs within a cycle of the double recurrence if

conducted observations of Aquila, Oph., and Orion B in HCN(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0),
and their isotopomers to calibrate the HCN and HCO$^+$ lines used as dense gas
tracers in extragalactic studies and to test the possible universality of the

H$^{13}$CN were observed to be good tracers of the filaments detected with
Herschel. Comparing the luminosities $L_{HCN}$ and $L_{HCO^+}$ with the
reference masses $M_{Herschel}^{Av>8}$, the empirical conversion factors
$\alpha_{Herschel-HCN}$ and $\alpha_{Herschel-HCO^+}$ were found to be
anti-correlated with the local FUV strength. In agreement with Pety et al.
(2017), HCN and HCO$^+$ were also found to trace gas down to Av>2. As a result,
published extragalactic HCN studies must be tracing all of the moderate density
gas. Estimating the contribution of this moderate density gas from the typical
column density PDFs in nearby clouds, we obtained the following $G_0$-dependent
HCN conversion factor for external
galaxies:$\alpha_{Herschel-HCN}^{fit'}=64\times G_0^{-0.34}$. Re-estimating the
dense gas masses in external galaxies with $\alpha_{Herschel-HCN}^{fit'}$, we
found that SFE$_{dense}$ is remarkably constant over 8 orders of magnitude in
dense gas mass. Our results confirm that SFE$_{dense}$ of galaxies is
quasi-universal on a wide range of scales from ~1-10pc to >10kpc. Based on the
tight link between SF and filamentary structure found in Herschel studies of
nearby clouds, we argue that SFE$_{dense}$ is primarily set by the microphysics

insights into its behavior in different symmetries and dimensionalities.
Evidence for the Higgs mode has been reported in a number of different
settings, including ultracold atomic gases, disordered superconductors, and
dimerized quantum magnets. However, decay processes of the Higgs mode (which
are eminently important in particle physics) have not yet been studied in
condensed matter due to the lack of a suitable material system coupled to a
direct experimental probe. A quantitative understanding of these processes is
particularly important for low-dimensional systems where the Higgs mode decays
rapidly and has remained elusive to most experimental probes. Here, we discover
and study the Higgs mode in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet using
spin-polarized inelastic neutron scattering. Our spin-wave spectra of
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ directly reveal a well-defined, dispersive Higgs mode, which
quickly decays into transverse Goldstone modes at the antiferromagnetic
ordering wavevector. Through a complete mapping of the transverse modes in the
reciprocal space, we uniquely specify the minimal model Hamiltonian and
describe the decay process. We thus establish a novel condensed matter platform

at frequency ranges close to these local resonances. As a result, these
structures present unusual wave propagation properties at wavelengths well
below the regime corresponding to band-gap generation based on spatial
periodicity, (i.e. ""Bragg scattering""). Therefore, acoustic/elastic
meta-materials can lead to applications, especially suitable in the
low-frequency range. However, low frequency range applications of such
meta-materials require very heavy internal moving masses, as well as additional
constraints at the amplitudes of the internally oscillating locally resonating
structures, which may prohibit their practical implementation. In order to
resolve this disadvantage, the K-Damping concept will be analyzed. According to
this concept, the acoustic/elastic meta-materials are designed to include
negative stiffness elements instead or in addition to the internally resonating
added masses. This concept removes the need for the heavy locally added heavy
masses, while it simultaneously exploits the negative stiffness damping
phenomenon. Application of both Bloch's theory and the classical modal analysis
at the one-dimensional mass-in-mass lattice is analyzed and corresponding
dispersion relations are derived. The results indicate significant advantages
over the conventional mass-in-a mass lattice, such as broader band-gaps and
increased damping ratio and reveal significant potential in the proposed
solution. Preliminary feasibility analysis for seismic meta-structures and low
frequency acoustic isolation-damping confirm the strong potential and

spin-independent interactions of WIMP with nuclei. These null results can be
accommodated in NMSSM provided that the effective spin-independent coupling of
the LSP to nucleons is suppressed. We investigate thermal relic abundance of
singlino-higgsino LSP in these so-called spin-independent blind spots and
derive current constraints and prospects for direct detection of spin-dependent
interactions of the LSP with nuclei providing strong constraints on parameter
space. We show that if the Higgs boson is the only light scalar the new LUX
constraints set a lower bound on the LSP mass of about 300 GeV except for a
small range around the half of $Z^0$ boson masses where resonant annihilation
via $Z^0$ exchange dominates. XENON1T will probe entire range of LSP masses
except for a tiny $Z^0$-resonant region that may be tested by the LZ
experiment. These conclusions apply to general singlet-doublet dark matter
annihilating dominantly to $t\bar{t}$. Presence of light singlet
(pseudo)scalars generically relaxes the constraints because new LSP (resonant
and non-resonant) annihilation channels become important. Even away from
resonant regions, the lower limit on the LSP mass from LUX is relaxed to about
250 GeV while XENON1T may not be sensitive to the LSP masses above about 400
GeV.

  Dynamic Stall","31 pages, 17 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effect of airfoil thickness on onset of dynamic stall is investigated using
large eddy simulations at chord-based Reynolds number of 200,000. Four
symmetric NACA airfoils of thickness-to-chord ratios of 9%, 12%, 15%, and 18%
are studied. The 3-D Navier Stokes solver, FDL3DI is used with a sixth-order
compact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization, second-order
implicit time integration, and discriminating filters to remove unresolved
wavenumbers. A constant-rate pitch-up maneuver is studied with the pitching
axis located at the airfoil quarter chord point. Simulations are performed in
two steps. In the first step, the airfoil is kept static at a prescribed angle
of attack ($=4^\circ$). In the second step, a ramp function is used to smoothly
increase the pitch rate from zero to the selected value and then the pitch rate
is held constant until the angle of attack goes past the lift stall point.
Comparisons against XFOIL for the static simulations show good agreement in
predicting the transition location. FDL3DI predicts two-stage transition for
thin airfoils (9% and 12%), which is not observed in the XFOIL results. The
dynamic simulations show that the onset of dynamic stall is marked by the
bursting of the laminar separation bubble (LSB) in all cases. However, for the
thickest airfoil tested, the reverse flow region spreads over most of the
airfoil and reaches the LSB location immediately before the LSB bursts and
dynamic stall begins, suggesting that stall could be triggered by the separated
turbulent boundary layer. The results suggest that the boundary between
different classifications of dynamic stall, particularly leading edge stall
versus trailing edge stall are blurred. The dynamic stall onset mechanism
changes gradually from one to the other with a gradual change in some
parameters, in this case, airfoil thickness.

the continuum quasi-PDF in the continuum limit. We point out, however, that the
continuum limit and massless quark limit do not commute. We find that the
condition to recover the same collinear divergence that the quasi-PDF has in
continuum QCD is $aP_3^2\approx m$ and $m\ll P_3$, while the condition to fully
recover the continuum quasi-PDF is $aP_{3}^{2}\ll m\ll P_{3}$, where $P_3$ is
the momentum in the direction of the quark's motion (longitudinal direction).
These two conditions are based on perturbation calculations and should not be
applied to non-perturbative calculations because the non-perturbative effects
cure the collinear divergence. The correction to the quasi-PDF using the
na\""ive fermion action is due to the Wilson term and can be viewed as an
$\mathcal{O}\left(a^{1}\right)$ correction. For nonzero $r$, the
$\mathcal{O}\left(a^{1}\right)$ corrections are subsequently mixed with the
quasi-PDF using the na\""ive fermion action.

dividing surface. A non-recrossing time-dependent dividing surface can
nevertheless be attached to the TS trajectory resulting in recrossing-free

replace DRAM as main memory. However, because of relatively high latency and
low bandwidth of NVM, NVM is often paired with DRAM to build a heterogeneous

carefully placed to NVM and DRAM for best performance. In this paper, we
introduce a lightweight runtime solution that automatically and transparently
manage data placement on HMS without the requirement of hardware modifications
and disruptive change to applications. Leveraging online profiling and
performance models, the runtime characterizes memory access patterns associated
with data objects, and minimizes unnecessary data movement. Our runtime
solution effectively bridges the performance gap between NVM and DRAM. We
demonstrate that using NVM to replace the majority of DRAM can be a feasible
solution for future HPC systems with the assistance of a software-based data

precisely between reactants and products for all time. This task is especially
demanding in time-dependent or driven systems because therein the dividing
surface (DS) between these states often exhibits a nontrivial time-dependence.
The so-called transition state (TS) trajectory has been seen to define a DS
which is free of recrossings in a large number of one-dimensional reactions
across time-dependent barriers, and, thus, allows one to determine exact
reaction rates. A fundamental challenge to applying this method is the
construction of the TS trajectory itself. The minimization of Lagrangian
descriptors (LDs) provides a general and powerful scheme to obtain that
trajectory even when perturbation theory fails. Both approaches encounter
possible breakdowns when the overall potential is bounded, admitting the
possibility of returns to the barrier long after trajectories have reached the
product or reactant wells. Such global dynamics cannot be captured by
perturbation theory. Meanwhile, in the LD-DS approach, it leads to the
emergence of additional local minima which make it difficult to extract the
optimal branch associated with the desired TS trajectory. In this work, we
illustrate this behavior for a time-dependent double-well potential revealing a
self-similar structure of the LD, and we demonstrate how the reflections and
side-minima can be addressed by an appropriate modification of the LD
associated with the direct rate across the barrier.

ensemble evolution in a dynamical model of an expanding HII region and checking
the effects of momentum transfer from dust to gas. The radiation pressure on
the dust, the dust drift, and the lug on the gas by the dust are all important
process that should be considered simultaneously to describe the dynamics of
HII regions. With accounting for the momentum transfer from the dust to the
gas, the expansion time of the HII region is notably reduced (for our model of
RCW120, the time to reach the observed radius of the HII region is reduced by a
factor of 1.5). Under the common approximation of frozen dust, where there is
no relative drift between the dust and gas, the radiation pressure from the
ionizing star drives the formation of the very deep gas cavity near the star.
Such a cavity is much less pronounced when the dust drift is taken into
account. The dust drift leads to the two-peak morphology of the dust density
distribution and significantly reduces the dust-to-gas ratio in the ionized
region (by a factor of 2 to 10). The dust-to-gas ratio is larger for higher
temperatures of the ionizing star since the dust grains have a larger electric
charge and are more strongly coupled to the gas.

which the accumulation of genome sequence data is increasingly fast and cheap.
The huge amount of molecular data available nowadays can help addressing new
and essential questions in Evolution. However, reconstructing evolution of DNA
sequences requires models, algorithms, statistical and computational methods of
ever increasing complexity. Since most dramatic genomic changes are caused by
genome rearrangements (gene duplications, gain/loss events), it becomes crucial
to understand their mechanisms and reconstruct ancestors of the given genomes.
This problem is known to be NP-complete even in the ""simplest"" case of three
genomes. Heuristic algorithms are usually executed to provide approximations of
the exact solution.
  We state that, even if the ancestral reconstruction problem is NP-hard in
theory, its exact resolution is feasible in various situations, encompassing
organelles and some bacteria. Such accurate reconstruction, which identifies
too some highly homoplasic mutations whose ancestral status is undecidable,
will be initiated in this work-in-progress, to reconstruct ancestral genomes of
two Mycobacterium pathogenetic bacterias. By mixing automatic reconstruction of
obvious situations with human interventions on signaled problematic cases, we
will indicate that it should be possible to achieve a concrete, complete, and
really accurate reconstruction of lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex. Thus, it is possible to investigate how these genomes have evolved
from their last common ancestors.

recovering indoor frame structure from a monocular image. It is more difficult
when occlusions and illumination vary, and object boundaries are weak. To
overcome these difficulties, a new approach based on line segment refinement
with two constraints is proposed. First, the line segments are refined by four
consecutive operations, i.e., reclassifying, connecting, fitting, and voting.
Specifically, misclassified line segments are revised by the reclassifying
operation, some short line segments are joined by the connecting operation, the
undetected key line segments are recovered by the fitting operation with the
help of the vanishing points, the line segments converging on the frame are
selected by the voting operation. Second, we construct four frame models
according to four classes of possible shooting angles of the monocular image,
the natures of all frame models are introduced via enforcing the cross ratio
and depth constraints. The indoor frame is then constructed by fitting those
refined line segments with related frame model under the two constraints, which
jointly advance the accuracy of the frame. Experimental results on a collection
of over 300 indoor images indicate that our algorithm has the capability of
recovering the frame from complex indoor scenes.

Type Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of
massive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine
must bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most
of these jets do not break out, and are instead ""choked"" inside the star, as
the central-engine activity time, $t_{\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling
the long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for
their central-engine activity times, $\propto t_{\rm e}^{-\alpha}$ for $t_{\rm
e}>t_{\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\alpha\sim4$) and a typical GRB
jet breakout time of $t_{\rm b}\sim 60\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The
latter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding
the progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity
GRBs. Extrapolating the range of validity of this power law below what is
directly observable, to $t_{\rm e}<t_{\rm b}$, by only a factor of $\sim$4-5
produces enough events to account for all Type Ib/c SNe. Such extrapolation is
necessary to avoid fine-tuning the distribution of central engine activity
times with the breakout time, which are presumably unrelated. We speculate that
central engines launching relativistic jets may operate in all Type Ib/c SNe.
In this case, the existence of a common central engine would imply that (i) the
jet may significantly contribute to the energy of the SN; (ii) various
observational signatures, like the asphericity of the explosion, could be
directly related to jet's interaction with the star.

temperature between $T \sim 150$ and 160 MeV, a region contained within the
region of the chiral transition. The minimum value of the number of states

placed on spheres with a squashed metric. We establish that the round sphere
provides a local extremum for the free energy which, in general, is not a
global extremum. In addition, we show that the leading quadratic correction to
the free energy around this extremum is proportional to the coefficient, $C_T$,
determining the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor in the CFT.
For three-dimensional CFTs, we compute explicitly this proportionality constant
for a class of squashing deformations which preserve an $SU(2)\times U(1)$
isometry group on the sphere. In addition, we evaluate the free energy as a
function of the squashing parameter for theories of free bosons, free fermions,
as well as CFTs holographically dual to Einstein gravity with a negative
cosmological constant. We observe that, after suitable normalization, the
dependence of the free energy on the squashing parameter for all these theories
is nearly universal for a large region of parameter space and is well
approximated by a simple quadratic function arising from holography. We
generalize our results to five-dimensional CFTs and, in this context, we also
study theories holographically dual to six-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity.

with the stock market and whether it can be a convincing proxy to predict the
stock market have been debated for years, especially for China. As the
traditional theory in behavioral finance states, the individual emotions can
influence decision-makings of investors, it is reasonable to further explore
these controversial topics systematically from the perspective of online
emotions, which are richly carried by massive tweets in social media. Through
thorough studies on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets and 3 million
investors from Weibo, it is revealed that inexperienced investors with high
emotional volatility are more sensible to the market fluctuations than the
experienced or institutional ones, and their dominant occupation also indicates
that the Chinese market might be more emotional as compared to its western
counterparts. Then both correlation analysis and causality test demonstrate
that five attributes of the stock market in China can be competently predicted
by various online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear. Specifically,
the presented prediction model significantly outperforms the baseline model,
including the one taking purely financial time series as input features, on
predicting five attributes of the stock market under the $K$-means
discretization. We also employ this prediction model in the scenario of
realistic online application and its performance is further testified.

interfacing with bioelements. When combined with its exceptional electronic and

bioelectronics. Among the successful bio-integrations of graphene, the
detection of ionic currents through artificial membrane channels and
extracellular action potentials in electrogenic cells have paved the road for
the high spatial resolution and wide-field imaging of neuronal activity.
However, various issues including the low signals amplitude, confinement and
stochasticity of neuronal signals associated to the complex architecture and
interconnectivity of neural networks should be still overcome. Recently, grain
boundaries found in CVD graphene were shown to drastically increase the
sensitivity of graphene transistors providing nanoscale sensing sites. Here we
demonstrate the ability of liquid-gated graphene field effect transistors

single ion channels activity. Dependence upon drugs and reference potential
gating is presented and is found compatible with the nanoscale coupling of a

A simulation study compares, in dimensions one and two, the approximate

using models based on classical continuum mechanics. However, the classical
continuum theories of elasticity and viscoelasticity cannot easily capture the
continual remodelling and associated structural changes of biological tissues.
Furthermore, models drawn from plasticity theory are difficult to apply and
interpret in this context, where there is no equivalent of a yield stress or
flow rule. In this work, we describe a novel one-dimensional mathematical model
of tissue remodelling based on the multiplicative decomposition of the
deformation gradient. We express the mechanical effects of remodelling as an
evolution equation for the 'effective strain', a measure of the difference
between the current state and a hypothetical mechanically-relaxed state of the
tissue. This morphoelastic model combines the simplicity and interpretability
of classical viscoelastic models with the versatility of plasticity theory. A
novel feature of our model is that while most models describe growth as a
continuous quantity, here we begin with discrete cells and develop a continuum
representation of lattice remodelling based on an appropriate limit of the
behaviour of discrete cells. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we use
this framework to capture qualitative aspects of the continual remodelling
observed in fibroblast-populated collagen lattices, in particular its
contraction and its subsequent sudden re-expansion when remodelling is
interrupted.

relatively Bernoulli. Secondly, using some facts about relative orbit
equivalence, the analogous result holds for all free and ergodic

schedules might lead to less efficient resource usages; (ii) the conventional
method to determine the task scheduling order may not be best suited to deal
with stream processing graphs, and; (iii) there is a need to be able to
schedule tasks with time-varying computational requirements efficiently. To
address (i), we propose the heterogeneous value with load balancing and
communication contention (HVLB_CC) (A) algorithm, which considers load
balancing in addition to the parameters considered by the HSV_CC algorithm. We
propose HVLB_CC (B) to address issue (ii). HVLB_CC (B) can deal with stream
processing task graphs and more various directed acyclic graphs to prevent
assigning a higher priority to successor tasks. In addition, to address issue
(iii), we propose HVLB_CC_IC. To schedule tasks more efficiently with various
computation times, HVLB_CC_IC utilizes schedule holes left in processors. These
idle time slots can be used for the execution of an optional part to generate
more precise data results by applying imprecise computation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve minimum
schedule length, accuracy, and load balancing significantly compared to the
HSV_CC algorithm. In addition, the proposed HVLB_CC (B) algorithm can schedule
more varied task graphs without reducing performance, and, using imprecise

neutrino sectors, respectively, $H^\nu_{\rm CP}$ being a remnant CP symmetry of

irradiation study of the BGO system shows that the exposure of BGO crystals to
$^{60}$Co $\gamma$-ray doses of 1 krad has led to immediate light output
reductions of 25--40%, and the light outputs further drop by 30--45% after the
crystals receive doses of 2--4 krad. Our findings agree with those of the
previous studies on the radiation hard (RH) BGO crystals grown by the low

BGO system is also consistent with the simulation, and is estimated to be about
1.18 times the equivalent dose. These results prove that the BGO system is able
to monitor the background dose rate in real time under extreme high radiation

initially unknown to the searchers, and its edges obstruct both movement and

the bound is tight. Furthermore, we give an improved algorithm that optimally
solves the Meeting problem with $k=2$ searchers in all polygons whose
barycenter is not in a hole (which includes the polygons with no holes). Our
algorithms can be implemented in a variety of standard models of mobile robots
operating in Look-Compute-Move cycles. For instance, if the searchers have
memory but are anonymous, asynchronous, and have no agreement on a coordinate
system or a notion of clockwise direction, then our algorithms work even if the
initial memory contents of the searchers are arbitrary and possibly misleading.
Moreover, oblivious searchers can execute our algorithms as well, encoding
information by carefully positioning themselves within the polygon. This code
is computable with basic arithmetic operations, and each searcher can
geometrically construct its own destination point at each cycle using only a
compass. We stress that such memoryless searchers may be located anywhere in
the polygon when the execution begins, and hence the information they initially
encode is arbitrary. Our algorithms use a self-stabilizing map construction
subroutine which is of independent interest.

applied to the task of modelling of correspondences of shapes in

its associated functional matrices. Mathematically spoken, functional maps are
composition operators between two-dimensional manifolds, and functional

be used to derive new nonlocal integrable equations. As applications of these

problems where the goal is to discover as many target elements as possible
using only limited label queries. With the advent of big data, there is a
growing emphasis on the scalability of such techniques to handle very large and
very complex datasets.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of Active Search where we are given a
similarity function between data points. We look at an algorithm introduced by
Wang et al. [2013] for Active Search over graphs and propose crucial
modifications which allow it to scale significantly. Their approach selects
points by minimizing an energy function over the graph induced by the
similarity function on the data. Our modifications require the similarity
function to be a dot-product between feature vectors of data points, equivalent
to having a linear kernel for the adjacency matrix. With this, we are able to
scale tremendously: for $n$ data points, the original algorithm runs in
$O(n^2)$ time per iteration while ours runs in only $O(nr + r^2)$ given
$r$-dimensional features.
  We also describe a simple alternate approach using a weighted-neighbor
predictor which also scales well. In our experiments, we show that our method
is competitive with existing semi-supervised approaches. We also briefly
discuss conditions under which our algorithm performs well.

parameters for the associated dyadic measure and a variant of a nerve
simplicial complex determined by the support of the dyadic measure together
with its betti numbers. The product coefficient parameters characterize the
relative skewness of the dyadic measure at dyadic scales and localities. The
more abstract betti number statistics summarize the simplicial geometry of the
support of the measure and satisfy a differential privacy property. Both types
of statistics can be computed algorithmically from the binary feature
representation of the data. This representation provides a new method for
pre-processing data into automatically generated features which explicitly
characterize the dyadic statistics and geometry of the data. useful for
statistical fusion, decision-making, inference, multi-scale hypothesis testing

exploit a representation lemma for dyadic measures on the unit interval

Bassu, Jones, Ness and Shallcross. We prove that dyadic sets with dyadic
measures have a canonical set of binary features and determine canonical nerve
simplicial complexes. We compare our methods with other results for measures on

free particle tunneling through a rectangular quantum-mechanical barrier. If
the energy difference between the barrier and the particle is positive, and the
barrier width is large enough, there is proof that the tunneling may be
superluminal. For first spinor components of particle and antiparticle states,
the tunneling is always superluminal regardless the barrier width. Conversely,
the second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states may be either
subluminal or superluminal depending on the barrier width. These results derive
from studying the tunneling time in terms of phase time. For the first spinor
components of particle and antiparticle states, it is always negative while for
the second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states, it is always
positive, whatever the height and width of the barrier. In total, the tunneling
time always remains positive for particle states while it becomes negative for
antiparticle ones. Furthermore, the phase time tends to zero, increasing the
potential barrier both for particle and antiparticle states. This agrees with
the interpretation of quantum tunneling that the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle provides. This study results are innovative with respect to those
available in the literature. Moreover, they show that the superluminal
behaviour of particles occurs in those processes with high-energy confinement.
