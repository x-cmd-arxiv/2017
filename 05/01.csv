  C. Wallace","Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media with Neural User Embeddings",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population
worldwide. However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and
characterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming
and expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence
of mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches
to supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived
from social media content provides a potential means for near real-time
estimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting,
evaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and
interventions.
  We propose a novel model for automated mental health status quantification
that incorporates user embeddings. This builds upon recent work exploring
representation learning methods that induce embeddings by leveraging social
media post histories. Such embeddings capture latent characteristics of
individuals (e.g., political leanings) and encode a soft notion of homophily.
In this paper, we investigate whether user embeddings learned from twitter post
histories encode information that correlates with mental health statuses. To
this end, we estimated user embeddings for a set of users known to be affected
by depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for a set of
demographically matched `control' users. We then evaluated these embeddings
with respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect
to mental health status; and (ii) the performance of downstream mental health
prediction models based on these features. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the user embeddings capture similarities between users with respect to
mental conditions, and are predictive of mental health.

calibration system is the Embedded LED/Laser Light Injection Entity (ELLIE). It
consists of three subsystems: AMELLIE, SMELLIE, TELLIE. The attenuation module
(AMELLIE) is designed to monitor the total optical attenuation, whereas the
optical scattering over a wavelength range of 375nm -- 700nm will be
characterized by the scattering module (SMELLIE). The timing module (TELLIE)

  (MFCS 2017)",,,,"cs.LO cs.FL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study two-player inclusion games played over word-generating higher-order
recursion schemes. While inclusion checks are known to capture verification
problems, two-player games generalize this relationship to program synthesis.
In such games, non-terminals of the grammar are controlled by opposing players.
The goal of the existential player is to avoid producing a word that lies
outside of a regular language of safe words.
  We contribute a new domain that provides a representation of the winning
region of such games. Our domain is based on (functions over) potentially
infinite Boolean formulas with words as atomic propositions. We develop an
abstract interpretation framework that we instantiate to abstract this domain
into a domain where the propositions are replaced by states of a finite
automaton. This second domain is therefore finite and we obtain, via standard
fixed-point techniques, a direct algorithm for the analysis of two-player
inclusion games. We show, via a second instantiation of the framework, that our
finite domain can be optimized, leading to a (k+1)EXP algorithm for order-k
recursion schemes. We give a matching lower bound, showing that our approach is
optimal. Since our approach is based on standard Kleene iteration, existing
techniques and tools for fixed-point computations can be applied.

alcohols reduce the miscibility transition temperature when added to giant

unilamellar vesicles. In both systems the change in temperature depends
non-monotonically on the length of the alcohol chain. To emphasize the roles
played by the internal entropies of the components, we model them as linear
polymers. We show that, within Flory-Huggins theory, the addition of alcohol
causes an increase or decrease of the transition temperature depending upon the
competition of two effects. One is the dilution of the solvent interactions
caused by the introduction of solute, which tends to lower the temperature. The
other is the preference of the solute for one phase or the other, which tends
to raise the temperature. The magnitude of this term depends on the entropies
of all components. Lastly we provide a reasonable explanation for the behavior
of the transition temperature with alcohol chain length observed in experiment.

largest saliency and a certain similarity to the previous one. Specifically, we
define a new tracking criterion which combines a grouping cost and an area

tracking more robust to local minima. To achieve real-time tracking
performance, we use Delaunay Triangulation to build a graph model with the
detected line segments and then reduce the tracking problem to finding the

of years to alleviate the problems encountered during Run I, especially in the

PMTs installed in the detectors and their solutions will be explained.
Initially, regular PMTs with thicker windows, causing large Cherenkov
radiation, were used. Instead of the light coming through the fibers from the
detector, stray muons passing through the PMT itself produce Cherenkov
radiation in the PMT window, resulting in erroneously large signals. Usually,
large signals are the result of very high-energy particles in the calorimeter
and are tagged as important. As a result, these so-called window events
generate false triggers. Four-anode PMTs with thinner windows were selected to
reduce these window events. Additional channels also help eliminate such
remaining events through algorithms comparing the output of different PMT
channels. During the EYETS 16/17 period in the LHC operations, the final
components of the modifications to the readout system, namely the two-channel
front-end electronics cards, are installed. Complete upgrade of the HF

sensor-based feedback and combinations thereof, thus generalizing former MLC

applied to the stabilization of a forced nonlinearly coupled three-oscillator

completion assume that the input partially-observed matrix is low rank. The
success of these methods depends on the number of observed entries and the rank
of the matrix; the larger the rank, the more entries need to be observed in
order to accurately complete the matrix. In this paper, we deal with matrices
that are not necessarily low rank themselves, but rather they contain low-rank

such matrices. In this framework, we first extract the low-rank submatrices and
then apply a matrix-completion algorithm to these low-rank submatrices as well

particles necessarily includes an additional new field, the chiral chemical
potential associated with the axial charge (i.e., the number difference between
right- and left-handed relativistic fermions). This chiral chemical potential
gives rise to a contribution to the electric current density of the plasma
(\emph{chiral magnetic effect}). We present a self-consistent treatment of the
\emph{chiral MHD equations}, which include the back-reaction of the magnetic
field on a chiral chemical potential and its interaction with the plasma
velocity field. A number of novel phenomena are exhibited. First, we show that
the chiral magnetic effect decreases the frequency of the Alfv\'{e}n wave for
incompressible flows, increases the frequencies of the Alfv\'{e}n wave and of
the fast magnetosonic wave for compressible flows, and decreases the frequency
of the slow magnetosonic wave. Second, we show that, in addition to the
well-known laminar chiral dynamo effect, which is not related to fluid motions,
there is a dynamo caused by the joint action of velocity shear and chiral
magnetic effect. In the presence of turbulence with vanishing mean kinetic
helicity, the derived mean-field chiral MHD equations describe turbulent
large-scale dynamos caused by the chiral alpha effect, which is dominant for
large fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers. The chiral alpha effect is due to an
interaction of the chiral magnetic effect and fluctuations of the small-scale
current produced by tangling magnetic fluctuations (which are generated by
tangling of the large-scale magnetic field by sheared velocity fluctuations).
These dynamo effects may have interesting consequences in the dynamics of the
early universe, neutron stars, and the quark--gluon plasma.

two-dimensional problem where the points are at the vertices of a convex

net anticlockwise torque around any vertex of the forces summed over any number
of consecutive points clockwise past the vertex must be non-negative; and one
can find a truss structure that supports under tension, and only supports,
those force multiplets in a convex polyhedron of force multiplets that is

$m_d(2\,\textrm{GeV}))$ = $4.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}\,\textrm{MeV}$, which is
consistent with the PDG (Particle Data Group) value and QCD sum rule
determinations in the pseudoscalar channel. This agreement provides a
consistent framework connecting QCD sum rules and low-energy hadronic physics.
We also obtain the decay constants of $\sigma$ and $f_0(980)$ at 2 GeV, which

cosmological dynamics coming from the polymer quantization of matter. We
demonstrate this in semiclassical cosmology with a scalar field and
pressureless dust: gravity is kept classical, dust is used to fix the time
gauge, and polymer quantization effects are isolated in the scalar field. The
resulting dynamics shows a period of inflation, both with and without a scalar
potential, and the emergence of a classical universe at late times. Since
gravity is not quantized, the cosmological singularity is not resolved, but our

when the data satisfies the low-rank assumption, classical matrix-completion
methods may output completions with significant error -- in that the
reconstructed matrix differs significantly from the true underlying matrix.
Often, this is due to the fact that the information contained in the observed

active version of matrix completion, where queries can be made to the true
underlying matrix. Subsequently, we design Order&Extend, which is the first
algorithm to unify a matrix-completion approach and a querying strategy into a
single algorithm. Order&Extend is able identify and alleviate insufficient

this question, we show that the moments evolution in any generic network can be
either approximated or, under suitable assumptions, computed exactly as the
solution of a switched affine system. Motivated by this application, we propose
a new method to approximate the reachable set of switched affine systems. A
remarkable feature of our approach is that it allows one to easily compute
projections of the reachable set for pairs of moments of interest, without
requiring the computation of the full reachable set, which can be prohibitive
for large networks. As a second contribution, we also show how to select the
external signal in order to maximize the probability of reaching a target set.
To illustrate the method we study a renown model of controlled gene expression

This is achieved by a suitable superposition of Bessel beams, whose parameters

we experimentally demonstrate three scenarios. In the first, the SoP of a
horizontally polarized beam evolves to radial polarization and is then changed
to vertical polarization, with the beam intensity held constant. In the second,
we simultaneously control the SoP and the longitudinal intensity profile, which
was chosen such that the beam's central ring can be switched-off over
predefined space regions, thus generating multiple foci with different SoP and
at different intensity levels along the propagation. Finally, the ability to
control the SoP while overcoming attenuation inside lossy fluids is shown
experimentally for the first time in the literature (to the best of our
knowledge). Therefore, we envision our proposed method to be of great interest

fixed point is obtained, which is shown to be a higher dimensional analogue of
the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, or a sliding Luttinger liquid. This non-Fermi
liquid metallic state, however, is unstable in the presence of weak interwire
backscatterings, which favor charge density wave states and suppress pairing.
Depending on the effective strength of the Coulomb repulsion and the size of
interwire spacing various charge density wave states are stabilized, including
Wigner crystal states. Our method allows for the determination of the specific
ordering patterns, and corresponding energy and temperature scales.

U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model, where three right-handed neutrinos are added to
the Standard Model in order to obtain non-zero masses for active neutrinos.
Because of the U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry, the structure of both
Dirac and Majorana mass terms of neutrinos is tightly restricted. In
particular, the inverse of the neutrino mass matrix has zeros in the
$(\mu,\mu)$ and $(\tau,\tau)$ components, namely, this model offers a symmetric
realization of the so-called two-zero-minor structure in the neutrino mass
matrix. Due to these constraints, all the CP phases-the Dirac CP phase $\delta$
and the Majorana CP phases $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$-as well as the mass
eigenvalues of the light neutrinos $m_i$ are uniquely determined as functions
of the neutrino mixing angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{13}$,
and the squared mass differences $\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\Delta m_{31}^2$. We
find that this model predicts the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ to be $\delta\simeq
1.59\pi$-$1.70\pi$ ($1.54\pi$-$1.78\pi$), the sum of the neutrino masses to be
$\sum_{i}m_i \simeq 0.14$-0.22 eV ($0.12$-0.40 eV), and the effective mass for
the neutrinoless double beta decay to be $\langle m_{\beta \beta }\rangle
\simeq 0.024$-0.055 eV ($0.017$-0.12 eV) at $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) level, which
are totally consistent with the current experimental limits. These predictions
can soon be tested in future neutrino experiments. Implications for
leptogenesis are also discussed.

by the authors in a series of recent papers. The goal is to understand this
subtle invariant of (singular) Poisson varieties, conditions for it to be
finite-dimensional, its relationship to the geometry and topology of symplectic
resolutions, and its applications to quantizations. The main technique is the
study of a canonical D-module on the variety. In the case the variety has
finitely many symplectic leaves (such as for symplectic singularities and
Hamiltonian reductions of symplectic vector spaces by reductive groups), the
D-module is holonomic, and hence the space of Poisson traces is
finite-dimensional. As an application, there are finitely many irreducible
finite-dimensional representations of every quantization of the variety.
Conjecturally, the D-module is the pushforward of the canonical D-module under
every symplectic resolution of singularities, which implies that the space of
Poisson traces is dual to the top cohomology of the resolution. We explain many
examples where the conjecture is proved, such as symmetric powers of du Val
singularities and symplectic surfaces and Slodowy slices in the nilpotent cone
of a semisimple Lie algebra. We compute the D-module in the case of surfaces
with isolated singularities, and show it is not always semisimple. We also
explain generalizations to arbitrary Lie algebras of vector fields, connections
to the Bernstein-Sato polynomial, relations to two-variable special polynomials
such as Kostka polynomials and Tutte polynomials, and a conjectural
relationship with deformations of symplectic resolutions. In the appendix we
give a brief recollection of the theory of D-modules on singular varieties that
we require.

thicker, than previously thought, or alternatively that the outer structure is
not a conventional disc at all. However, the velocity dispersion $\sigma_{0z}$

incompressible fluid where the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress tensor is
related to the symmetric part of the velocity gradient via a maximal monotone
2-graph that is continuously parametrized by the temperature. As such, the
considered fluid may go through transitions between three of the following
regimes: it can flow as a Bingham fluid for a specific value of the
temperature, while it can behave as the Navier-Stokes fluid for another value
of the temperature or, for yet another temperature, it can respond as the Euler
fluid until a certain activation initiates the response of the Navier-Stokes
fluid. At the same time, we regard a generalized threshold slip on the boundary
that also may go through various regimes continuously with the temperature. All
material coefficients like the dynamic viscosity, friction or activation
coefficients are assumed to be temperature-dependent. We establish the
large-data and long-time existence of weak solutions, applying the
$L^{\infty}$-truncation technique to approximate the velocity field.

findings of our study show that the original model indeed is canonically
equivalent to the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model for a given
value of the background parameters. Moreover, by a convenient coordinate
transformation we show that this model describes a string propagating in a
spacetime with the BTZ black hole metric in such a way that a new family of the
solutions to low energy string theory with the BTZ black hole vacuum metric,
constant dilaton field and a new torsion potential is found. The dual model is
built on a $2+1$-dimensional target manifold $\tilde {\cal M}$ with
two-dimensional real Abelian Lie group ${\tilde {\bf G}}$ acting freely on it.
We further show that the dual model yields a three-dimensional charged black
string for which the mass $M$ and axion charge $Q$ per unit length are
calculated. After that, the structure and asymptotic nature of the dual
space-time including the horizon and singularity are determined.

nonclassicalities, such as higher order squeezing, higher order sub-Poissonian
photon statistics, higher order antibunching. It is observed that both photon
added and photon subtracted squeezed coherent states are highly nonclassical as
they satisfy criteria for all of the above mentioned nonclassicalities and a
set of other criteria including negativity of Wigner function, Klyshko's
criterion and Agarwal's $(A_{3})$ parameter. Further, the amount of
nonclassicality present in these two types of states has been compared
quantitatively using a measure of nonclassicality known as nonclassical volume.
Variation in the amount of nonclassicality with the number of photon(s)

photons makes the squeezed coherent state more nonclassical than what is done
by the subtraction of photons.

achieves our objective by construction, and has the nice property that the
inner non smooth optimization problem can be solved analytically, thus reducing
GSMV to the maximization of a smooth and convex function under unit norm and
orthogonality constraints, which generalizes Journee et al. (2010) to group
sparsity. Numerical comparison with deflation on synthetic data shows that GSMV
produces steadily slightly better and more robust results for the retrieval of

regime, without averaging over multiple condensate realisations. In this highly
non-stationary regime, a condensate is strongly influenced by the `hot'

on a typical RL gridworld with multimodal dynamics. Results show VI

connected to the CU via finite-capacity fronthaul links. This work argues that
the quantization noise introduced by fronthaul quantization can be leveraged to
act as ""artificial"" noise in order to enhance the rates achievable under
secrecy constraints. To this end, it is proposed to control the statistics of
the quantization noise by applying multivariate, or joint, fronthaul
quantization/compression at the CU across all outgoing fronthaul links.
Assuming wiretap coding, the problem of jointly optimizing the precoding and
multivariate compression strategies, along with the covariance matrices of
artificial noise signals generated by RUs, is formulated with the goal of
maximizing the weighted sum of achievable secrecy rates while satisfying per-RU
fronthaul capacity and power constraints. After showing that the artificial
noise covariance matrices can be set to zero without loss of optimaliy, an
iterative optimization algorithm is derived based on the concave convex

responsible for the relative orientation between density structures,
characterized by their gradient, $\vec{\nabla}\rho$, and the magnetic field,
$\vec{B}$, in molecular clouds (MCs). For that purpose, we construct an
expression for the time evolution of the angle, $\phi$, between
$\vec{\nabla}\rho$ and $\vec{B}$ based on the transport equations of MHD
turbulence. Using this expression, we find that the configuration where
$\vec{\nabla}\rho$ and $\vec{B}$ are mostly parallel, $\cos\phi=1$, and where
$\vec{\nabla}\rho$ and $\vec{B}$ are mostly perpendicular, $\cos\phi=0$,
constitute attractors, that is, the system tends to evolve towards either of
these configurations and they are more represented than others. This fact would
explain the predominant alignment or anti-alignment between column density,
$N_H$, structures and the projected magnetic field orientation,
$\hat{B}_\perp$, reported in observations. Additionally, we find that
departures from the $\cos\phi=0$ configurations are related to convergent
flows, quantified by the divergence of the velocity field,
$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v}$, in the presence of a relatively strong magnetic
field. This would explain the observed change in relative orientation between
$N_H$-structures and $\hat{B}_\perp$ towards MCs, from mostly parallel at low
$N_H$ to mostly perpendicular at the highest $N_H$, as the result of the
gravitational collapse and/or convergence of flows. Finally, we show that the
density threshold that marks the observed change in relative orientation
towards MCs, from $N_H$ and $\hat{B}_\perp$ being mostly parallel at low $N_H$
to mostly perpendicular at the highest $N_H$, is related to the magnetic field

interesting as a means of enabling sustainable, wireless communication without
the need to recharge or replace the battery driving the relays. However,
reliability of such communication systems becomes an important design challenge
when such relays scavenge energy from the information bearing RF signals
received from the source, using the technique of simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT). To this aim, this work studies
bidirectional communication in a decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted
cooperative wireless network in presence of co-channel interference (CCI). In
order to quantify the reliability of the bidirectional communication systems, a
closed form expression for the outage probability of the system is derived for
both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) mode of operation of the
relay. Simulation results are used to validate the accuracy of our analytical
results and illustrate the dependence of the outage probability on various
system parameters, like PS factor, TS factor, and distance of the relay from
both the users. Results of performance comparison between PS relaying (PSR) and
TS relaying (TSR) schemes are also presented. Besides, simulation results are
also used to illustrate the spectral-efficiency and the energy-efficiency of
the proposed system. The results show that, both in terms of spectral
efficiency and the energy-efficiency, the two-way communication system in
presence of moderate CCI power, performs better than the similar system without
CCI. Additionally, it is also found that PSR is superior to TSR protocol in
terms of peak energy-efficiency.

the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope as the last large project before the
upgrade of the telescope with phased array feed receivers (Apertif). The sample
covers almost four orders of magnitude in radio power from $\log\,P_{\rm 1.4
\,GHz}=22.5$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $26.2$ W Hz$^{-1}$. We detect HI in absorption in
$27\% \pm 5.5\%$ of the objects. The distribution and kinematics of the
absorbing HI gas appear to depend on radio power, the properties of the radio
continuum emission, and the dust content of the sources. Among the sources
where HI is detected, gas with kinematics deviating from regular rotation is
more likely found as the radio power increases. In these cases, the HI profile
is often asymmetric with a significant blue-shifted component. This is
particularly common for sources with $\log\,P_{\rm 1.4 \, GHz}>24$ W Hz$^{-1}$,
where the radio emission is small, possibly because these radio sources are
young. The same is found for sources that are bright in the mid-infrared, i.e.
sources rich in heated dust. In these sources, the HI is outflowing likely
under the effect of the interaction with the radio emission. Conversely, in
dust-poor galaxies, and in sources with extended radio emission, at all radio
powers we only detect HI distributed in a rotating disk. Stacking experiments
show that in sources for which we do not detect HI in absorption directly, the
HI has a column density that is lower than $3.5\times 10^{17} (T_{ \rm

absorption lines that will be detected by the upcoming surveys of the Square

interaction of accelerated cosmic rays with the interstellar medium is not yet
determined. The characterization of this flux will shed light on Galactic
accelerator features, gas distribution morphology and Galactic cosmic ray
transport. The central Galactic plane can be the site of an enhanced neutrino
production, thus leading to anisotropies in the extraterrestrial neutrino
signal as measured by the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino
telescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, offers a favourable view on this
part of the sky, thereby allowing for a contribution to the determination of
this flux. The expected diffuse Galactic neutrino emission can be obtained
linking a model of generation and propagation of cosmic rays with the
morphology of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. In this paper, the
so-called ""Gamma model"" introduced recently to explain the high-energy gamma
ray diffuse Galactic emission, is assumed as reference. The neutrino flux
predicted by the ""Gamma model"" depends of the assumed primary cosmic ray
spectrum cut-off. Considering a radially-dependent diffusion coefficient, this
proposed scenario is able to account for the local cosmic ray measurements, as
well as for the Galactic gamma ray observations. Nine years of ANTARES data are
used in this work to search for a possible Galactic contribution according to
this scenario. All flavour neutrino interactions are considered. No excess of
events is observed and an upper limit is set on the neutrino flux of $1.1$
($1.2$) times the prediction of the ""Gamma model"" assuming the primary cosmic
ray spectrum cut-off at 5 (50) PeV. This limit excludes the diffuse Galactic
neutrino emission as the major cause of the ""spectral anomaly"" between the two
hemispheres measured by IceCube.

the solution. Accuracy and stability of the method are illustrated through the
numerical simulation of the dissipative wave equation and a port-Hamiltonian

viscous fluids, with active contractility and traction on the substrate. The
combination of both active forces generate an instability that leads to
nonlinear traveling waves, which propagate in the direction of polarity with
characteristic time scales that depend on contact forces. We show that a
viscous fluid model explains a variety of observations on the slow dynamics of
epithelial monolayers, in particular those that had been interpreted before as
signatures of elasticity. The non-elastic nature of the waves can be tested on
the basis of simple predictions of the model. Our theoretical framework
provides new insights such as the interpretation of plithotaxis as a result of
a strong flow-polarity coupling, and the quantification of collective
force-transmission of cells in terms of the non-locality of interactions. In
addition, we study the nonlinear regime of those waves deriving an exact map of
the model into the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, which provides a complete
classification of possible nonlinear scenarios. In particular, we predict the
transition to different forms of weak turbulence, which in turn could explain
the very unstable and irregular dynamics often observed in epithelia.

we consider the constant and linear parametrization of the effective Newton
constant models. Firstly, under the adiabatic assumption, the correction from
the extra scalar degree of freedom in the beyond $\Lambda$CDM model is found to
be negligible. The dominant ingredient in this setup is the primordial
curvature perturbation originated from inflation mechanism, and the energy
budget of the matter components is not very crucial. Secondly, the
iso-curvature perturbation sourced by the extra scalar field is studied. For
the constant and linear model of the effective Newton constant, there is no
such kind of scalar mode exist. For the quadratic model, there is a non-trivial
one. However, the amplitude of the scalar field is damped away very fast on all
scales. Consequently, it could not support a reasonable structure formation.
Finally, we study the importance of the setup of the scalar field starting
time. By setting different turn-on time, namely $a=10^{-2} $ and $a=10^{-7} $,
we compare the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature, lensing
deflection angle auto-correlation function as well as the matter power spectrum
in the constant and linear model. We find there is an order of
$\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ difference in the observable spectra for constant model,

missing, for example when the instrument is a genetic test in Mendelian
randomization studies. In this paper we discuss two apparent paradoxes that
arise in so-called single consent designs where there is one-sided
noncompliance, i.e., where unencouraged units cannot access treatment. The
first paradox is that, even under a missing completely at random assumption, a
complete-case analysis is biased when knowledge of one-sided noncompliance is
taken into account; this is not the case when such information is disregarded.
This occurs because incorporating information about one-sided noncompliance
induces a dependence between the missingness and treatment. The second paradox
is that, although incorporating such information does not lead to efficiency
gains without missing data, the story is different when instrument values are
missing: there, incorporating such information changes the efficiency bound,
allowing possible efficiency gains. This is because some of the missing values
can be filled in, based on the fact that anyone who received treatment must
have been encouraged by the instrument (since the unencouraged cannot access
treatment).

Permian Rustler Formation is a potential radionuclide release pathway from the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), the only deep geological repository for
transuranic waste in the United States. In early conceptual models of the
Culebra, groundwater levels were not expected to fluctuate markedly, except in
response to long-term climatic changes, with response times on the order of
hundreds to thousands of years. Recent groundwater pressures measured in
monitoring wells record more than 25 m of drawdown. The fluctuations are
attributed to pumping activities at a privately-owned well that may be
associated with the demand of the Permian Basin hydrocarbon industry for water.
The unprecedented magnitude of drawdown provides an opportunity to
quantitatively assess the influence of unplanned anthropogenic forcings near
the WIPP. Spatially variable realizations of Culebra saturated hydraulic
conductivity and storativity were used to develop groundwater flow models to
estimate a pumping rate for the private well and investigate its effect on
advective transport. Simulated drawdown shows reasonable agreement with
observations (average Model Efficiency coefficient = 0.7). Steepened hydraulic
gradients associated with the pumping reduce estimates of conservative particle
travel times across the domain by one-half and shift the intersection of the
average particle track with the compliance boundary by more than two
kilometers. The value of the transient simulations conducted for this study lie
in their ability to (i) improve understanding of the Culebra groundwater flow
system and (ii) challenge the notion of time-invariant land use in the vicinity

triple point, nexus, and nodal link, which are protected by coexistence of
spatial-inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry. This nodal-net state is
remarkably different from that of IrF$_4$, which requires sublattice chiral
symmetry. In addition, linearly and quadratically dispersed two-dimensional
surface Dirac points are identified as having emerged on the B-terminated and
Ti-terminated (001) surfaces of TiB$_2$ respectively, which are analogous to
those of monolayer and bilayer graphene.

regularization on the variances of the codewords is introduced which allows to
extend the RQ for very large numbers of layers and also for high dimensional

Quantization (RRQ) results in multi-layer dictionaries which are additionally
sparse, thanks to the soft-thresholding nature of the regularization when
applied to variance-decaying data which can arise from de-correlating
transformations applied to correlated data. Furthermore, we also propose a
general-purpose pre-processing for natural images which makes them suitable for
such quantization. The RRQ framework is first tested on synthetic
variance-decaying data to show its efficiency in quantization of
high-dimensional data. Next, we use the RRQ in super-resolution of a database
of facial images where it is shown that low-resolution facial images from the
test set quantized with codebooks trained on high-resolution images from the
training set show relevant high-frequency content when reconstructed with those
codebooks.

which is solved and substituted in the original Lagrangian, provide examples of
the so called Nambu models, in the case where such constraints arise from
spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. Some explicit calculations have shown
that, after additional conditions are imposed, Nambu models are capable of
reproducing the original gauge theories, thus making Lorentz violation
unobservable and allowing the interpretation of the corresponding massless
gauge bosons as the Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous symmetry
breaking. A natural question posed by this approach in the realm of gauge
theories is to determine under which conditions the recovery of an arbitrary
gauge theory from the corresponding Nambu model, defined by a general
constraint over the coordinates, becomes possible. We refer to these theories
as extended Nambu models (ENM) and emphasize the fact that the {defining
coordinate} constraint is not treated as a standard gauge fixing term. At this
level, the mechanism for generating the constraint is irrelevant and the case
of spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking is taken only as a motivation, which
naturally bring this problem under consideration. Using a non-perturbative
Hamiltonian analysis we prove that the ENM yields the original gauge theory
after we demand current conservation for all time, together with the imposition
of the Gauss laws constraints as initial conditions upon the dynamics of the
ENM. The Nambu models yielding electrodynamics, Yang Mills theories and
linearized gravity are particular examples of our general approach.

physical applications, ranging from nonlinear optics to Bose-Einstein

involved, it can prove useful to approximate such a structure by a metric
graph, or network. For the Schroedinger equation it turns out that the sixth
power in the nonlinear term of the energy is critical in the sense that below
that power the constrained energy is lower bounded irrespectively of the value
of the mass (subcritical case). On the other hand, if the nonlinearity power
equals six, then the lower boundedness depends on the value of the mass: below
a critical mass, the constrained energy is lower bounded, beyond it, it is not.
For powers larger than six the constrained energy functional is never lower
bounded, so that it is meaningless to speak about ground states (supercritical
case). These results are the same as in the case of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation on the real line. In fact, as regards the existence of ground states,
the results for systems on graphs differ, in general, from the ones for systems
on the line even in the subcritical case: in the latter case, whenever the
constrained energy is lower bounded there always exist ground states (the
solitons, whose shape is explicitly known), whereas for graphs the existence of
a ground state is not guaranteed. For the critical case, our results show a
phenomenology much richer than the analogous on the line.

  in low inertia power systems",,,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Implementing frequency response using grid-connected inverters is one of the
popular proposed alternatives to mitigate the dynamic degradation experienced
in low inertia power systems. However, such solution faces several challenges
as inverters do not intrinsically possess the natural response to power
fluctuations that synchronous generators have. Thus, to synthetically generate
this response, inverters need to take frequency measurements, which are usually
noisy, and subsequently make changes in the output power, which are therefore
delayed. This paper explores the system-wide performance tradeoffs that arise
when measurement noise, power disturbances, and delayed actions are considered
in the design of dynamic controllers for grid-connected inverters. Using a
recently proposed dynamic droop (iDroop) control for grid-connected inverters,
which is inspired by classical first order lead-lag compensation, we show that
the sets of parameters that result in highest noise attenuation, power
disturbance mitigation, and delay robustness do not necessarily have a common
intersection. In particular, lead compensation is desired in systems where
power disturbances are the predominant source of degradation, while lag
compensation is a better alternative when the system is dominated by delays or
frequency noise. Our analysis further shows that iDroop can outperform the
standard droop alternative in both joint noise and disturbance mitigation, and
delay robustness.

temperature significantly exceeds the temperature of big bang nucleosynthesis.

degrees of freedom and treated as point-like particles with their interactions
described by meson exchanges and the medium effects on the cluster binding
energies are described by density- and temperature-dependent energy shifts with
the parameters obtained by fitting the experimental cluster Mott densities. We
find that the composition of low density nuclear matter with light clusters is
essentially determined by the density- and temperature-dependence of the
cluster binding energy shifts. Compared with the values of the conventional

their fourth-order values are found to be significant at low densities ($\rho
\sim 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$) and low temperatures ($T \lesssim 3$ MeV), indicating
the invalidity of the empirical parabolic law for the isospin asymmetry
dependence of these nuclear matter properties. Our results indicate that in the
density region of $\rho \gtrsim 0.02$ fm$^{-3}$, the clustering effects become
insignificant and the nuclear matter is dominated by nucleon degree of freedom.

multivariate setting, which includes among others, the Bachelier and the
Black-Scholes models. In high dimensions, nonlinear partial differential
equation methods for solving the problem become prohibitively costly due to the
curse of dimensionality. Instead, this work proposes to use a stopping rule
that depends on the dynamics of a low-dimensional Markovian projection of the
given basket of assets. It is shown that the ability to approximate the
original value function by a lower-dimensional approximation is a feature of
the dynamics of the system and is unaffected by the path-dependent nature of
the American basket option. Assuming that we know the density of the forward
process and using the Laplace approximation, we first efficiently evaluate the
diffusion coefficient corresponding to the low-dimensional Markovian projection
of the basket. Then, we approximate the optimal early-exercise boundary of the
option by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation in
the projected, low-dimensional space. The resulting near-optimal early-exercise
boundary is used to produce an exercise strategy for the high-dimensional
option, thereby providing a lower bound for the price of the American basket
option. A corresponding upper bound is also provided. These bounds allow to
assess the accuracy of the proposed pricing method. Indeed, our approximate
early-exercise strategy provides a straightforward lower bound for the American
basket option price. Following a duality argument due to Rogers, we derive a
corresponding upper bound solving only the low-dimensional optimal control
problem. Numerically, we show the feasibility of the method using baskets with
dimensions up to fifty. In these examples, the resulting option price relative
errors are only of the order of few percent.

spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we further find that
metallic Pr4Ni3O8 exhibits a low-spin configuration and significant orbital
polarization of the unoccupied eg states with pronounced dx2-y2 character near
the Fermi energy, both hallmarks of the cuprate superconductors. Belonging to a
regime of 3d electron count found for hole-doped cuprates, Pr4Ni3O8 thus
represents one of the closest analogies to cuprates yet reported and a
singularly promising candidate for high-Tc superconductivity if appropriately

fundamental questions on how the vehicle membership within CMM affects the

obey a uniform distribution. Finally, the localization accuracy of CMM is

unified Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formalism is particularly interesting when it is
applied to these kinds of theories, since it simplifies the treatment of them;
in particular, the implementation of the constraint algorithm, the retrieval of
the Lagrangian description, and the construction of the covariant Hamiltonian
formalism. In order to apply this algorithm to the covariant field equations,
they must be written in a suitable geometrical way, which consists of using
integrable distributions, represented by multivector fields of a certain type.
We apply all these tools to the Einstein-Hilbert model without and with
energy-matter sources. We obtain and explain the geometrical and physical
meaning of the Lagrangian constraints and we construct the multimomentum
(covariant) Hamiltonian formalisms in both cases. As a consequence of the gauge
freedom and the constraint algorithm, we see how this model is equivalent to a
first-order regular theory, without gauge freedom. In the case of presence of
energy-matter sources, we show how some relevant geometrical and physical
characteristics of the theory depend on the type of source. In all the cases,
we obtain explicitly multivector fields which are solutions to the

semi-infinite impermeable flat plates in an attempt to control trailing-edge
noise through bio-inspired adaptations. Specifically the problem of sound
generated by a gust convecting in uniform mean steady flow scattering off the
trailing edge and permeable-impermeable junction is considered. This setup
supposes that any realistic trailing-edge adaptation to a blade would be
sufficiently small so that the turbulent boundary layer encapsulates both the
porous edge and the permeable-impermeable junction, and therefore the
interaction of acoustics generated at these two discontinuous boundaries is
important. The acoustic problem is tackled analytically through use of the
Wiener-Hopf method. A two-dimensional matrix Wiener-Hopf problem arises due to
the two interaction points (the trailing edge and the permeable-impermeable
junction). This paper discusses a new iterative method for solving this matrix
Wiener-Hopf equation which extends to further two-dimensional problems in
particular those involving analytic terms that exponentially grow in the upper
or lower half planes. This method is an extension of the commonly used ""pole
removal"" technique and avoids the needs for full matrix factorisation.
Convergence of this iterative method to an exact solution is shown to be
particularly fast when terms neglected in the second step are formally smaller
than all other terms retained. The final acoustic solution highlights the
effects of the permeable-impermeable junction on the generated noise, in
particular how this junction affects the far-field noise generated by
high-frequency gusts by creating an interference to typical trailing-edge
scattering. This effect results in partially porous plates predicting a lower
noise reduction than fully porous plates when compared to fully impermeable
plates.

several attributes with optical-frequency transfer and therefore exhibits
several advantages over other microwave-frequency transfer techniques. We
demonstrated stabilized transfer of an 8,000 MHz microwave-frequency signal
over a 166 km metropolitan optical fiber network, achieving a fractional
frequency stability of 6.8x10^-14 Hz/Hz at 1 s integration, and 5.0x10^-16
Hz/Hz at 1.6x10^4 s. This technique is being considered for use on the Square

now being investigated by various research teams, crucial questions about the
timing of such a vast financial and labor investment arise. If humanity could
build high-speed interstellar lightsails and reach the alpha Centauri system 20
yr after launch, would it be better to wait a few years, then take advantage of
further technology improvements to increase the speed, and arrive earlier
despite waiting? The risk of being overtaken by a future, faster probe has been
described earlier as the incentive trap. Based on 211 yr of historical data, we
find that the speed growth of human-made vehicles, from steam-driven
locomotives to Voyager 1, is much faster than previously believed, about 4.72 %
annually or a doubling every 15 yr. We derive the mathematical framework to
calculate the minimum of the wait time (t) plus travel time (tau(t)) and extend
two exponential growth law models into the relativistic regime. We show that
the minimum of t+tau(t) disappears for nearby targets. There is no use of
waiting for speed improvements once we can reach an object within about 20 yr
of travel, irrespective of the actual speed. In terms of speed, the t+tau(t)
minimum for a travel to alpha Centauri will occur once 19.6 % the speed of
light (c) become available, in agreement with the 20 % c proposed by the
Breakthrough Starshot Initiative. If interstellar travel at 20 % c can be
obtained within 45 yr from today and if the kinetic energy could be increased
at a rate consistent with the historical record, then humans can reach the ten
most nearby stars within 100 yr from today.

  assembly bias","14 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models were originally
developed based on results from semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy
formation models. Those models have since progressed, in particular to include
AGN feedback to match the galaxy luminosity function in a universe with the
observed baryon fraction. AGN feedback affects the relationship between galaxy
stellar mass and luminosity, in particular making the relationship
non-monotonic. For matched number density samples, galaxies in
luminosity-threshold samples occupy a different range of halo masses from those
in stellar-mass-threshold samples. We find that the shapes of the HODs of
luminosity-threshold samples are slightly more complicated in semi-analytic
galaxy formation models that include AGN feedback than are assumed by standard
HOD models. We also find that subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) does not
preserve these non-standard shapes. We show that catalogues created using SHAM
and the semi-analytic model Galform that have the same large-scale 2-point
clustering by construction have different void probability functions (VPFs) in
both real and redshift space. We find that these differences arise from the
different HOD shapes, as opposed to assembly bias, which indicates that the VPF
could be used to test the suitability of an HOD model with real data.

constant monitoring, which may become an expensive and time-consuming practice.
The perception of quality, from the users point of view is an important aspect
of quality monitoring. In this sense, we proposed a methodology for data
analysis and visualization, supported by software, which allows for the
structuring of estimates and assumptions of where and who seems to be having
unsatisfactory experiences while making use of the public transportation in
populous metropolitan areas. Moreover, it provides support in setting up a plan
for on-site quality surveys. The proposed methodology increases the likelihood
that, with the on-site visits, the interviewer finds users who suffer
inconveniences, which influence their behavior. Simulation comparison and a
small-scale pilot survey stand for the validity of the proposed method.

inelastic scattering, where a transition to a low-lying excited nuclear state
of $^{129}$Xe is induced. The experimental signature is a nuclear recoil
observed together with the prompt de-excitation photon. We see no evidence for
such inelastic WIMP-$^{129}$Xe interactions. A profile likelihood analysis
allows us to set a 90\% C.L. upper limit on the inelastic, spin-dependent
WIMP-nucleon cross section of $3.3 \times 10^{-38}$\,cm$^{2}$ at
100\,GeV/c$^2$. This is the most constraining result to date, and sets the
pathway for an analysis of this interaction channel in upcoming, larger

tied to human consciousness. But despite this intimate relation of time with
human conscious experience, time has proved to be very elusive. Particularly in
physics, though there is already some understanding of time, there are still so
many paradoxes that plague this understanding. In this paper we take rather a
different route to question of time. We first attempt to come up with a
theoretical understanding of time perception. Quite interestingly we find that
quantum theory provides an algebraic formulation within which we can understand
some essential aspects of time perception by human mind. We then ask whether a
similar formalism can furnish the understanding of time as well and find
connections of our formulation of time with similar works by other researchers.
Our underlying approach to question of time has been inspired by R. W. Hamilton
who considers algebra as science of pure time. Hence our work has an extensive
algebraic flavor. Our work also incorporates another approach based on
Kauffman's iterant algebra which relates time to underlying recursions and
oscillations. We believe that our work will initiate more investigations in
this direction.
