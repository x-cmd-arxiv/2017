This concept has a clear impact on several key areas of interest for the MEMS
community, including but not limited to ultra-compact microsystems for
sensitive detection of small number of target molecules, and surface devices
for optical data storage, micro-imaging and displaying. In this paper, we
review the current state-of-the-art in plasmonic theory as well as derive
design guidance for plasmonic integration with microsystems, fabrication
techniques, and selected applications in biosensing, including refractive-index
based label-free biosensing, plasmonic integrated lab-on-chip systems,
plasmonic near-field scanning optical microscopy and plasmonics on-chip systems
for cellular imaging. This paradigm enables low-profile conformal surfaces on

used for a clustering task and introduce two novel loss components that
substantially improve the quality of produced clusters, are simple to apply to
an arbitrary model and cost function, and do not require a complicated training
procedure. We evaluate them on two most common types of models, Recurrent

propose consistently improves the quality of KMeans clustering in terms of
Adjusted Mutual Information score and outperforms previously proposed methods.

shared wireless infrastructure which are customized to specific mobile
operators/services. Given infrastructure costs and the stochastic nature of
mobile services' spatial loads, it is highly desirable to achieve efficient
statistical multiplexing amongst such slices. We study a simple dynamic
resource sharing policy which allocates a 'share' of a pool of (distributed)
resources to each slice-Share Constrained Proportionally Fair (SCPF). We give a
characterization of SCPF's performance gains over static slicing and general
processor sharing. We show that higher gains are obtained when a slice's
spatial load is more 'imbalanced' than, and/or 'orthogonal' to, the aggregate
network load, and that the overall gain across slices is positive. We then
address the associated dimensioning problem. Under SCPF, traditional network
dimensioning translates to a coupled share dimensioning problem, which
characterizes the existence of a feasible share allocation given slices'
expected loads and performance requirements. We provide a solution to robust
share dimensioning for SCPF-based network slicing. Slices may wish to
unilaterally manage their users' performance via admission control which
maximizes their carried loads subject to performance requirements. We show this
can be modeled as a 'traffic shaping' game with an achievable Nash equilibrium.
Under high loads, the equilibrium is explicitly characterized, as are the gains
in the carried load under SCPF vs. static slicing. Detailed simulations of a
wireless infrastructure supporting multiple slices with heterogeneous mobile
loads show the fidelity of our models and range of validity of our high load
equilibrium analysis.

fermions (WFs) arise as pseudo-magnetic monopoles in its momentum space. The
chirality of the WFs, given by the sign of the monopole charge, is central to
the Weyl physics, since it directly serves as the sign of the topological
number and gives rise to exotic properties such as Fermi arcs and the chiral
anomaly. Despite being the defining property of a WSM, the chirality of the WFs
has never been experimentally measured. Here, we directly detect the chirality
of the WFs by measuring the photocurrent in response to circularly polarized
mid-infrared light. The resulting photocurrent is determined by both the
chirality of WFs and that of the photons. Our results pave the way for
realizing a wide range of theoretical proposals for studying and controlling
the WFs and their associated quantum anomalies by optical and electrical means.
More broadly, the two chiralities, analogous to the two valleys in 2D

the size of the unfolding, and a novel cutoff criterion based on subsumption to

primary application has universal features that can be shared with other
applications, to reduce the overall feature extraction cost, while the
secondary application does not. In this setting, the two applications can
collaborate via feature sharing. We provide a method to optimize the operation
of the multi-application cascade system based on an accurate resource

white dwarf. The system shows emission from radio to X-rays, likely dominated
by synchrotron radiation. The mechanism that produces most of this emission
remains unclear. Two competing scenarios have been proposed: Collimated
outflows, and direct interaction between the magnetospheres of the white dwarf
and the M star. The two proposed scenarios can be tested via very long baseline
interferometric radio observations. We conducted a radio observation with the
Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) on 20 Oct 2016 at 8.5 GHz to study the
compactness of the radio emission. Simultaneous data with the Australian
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) were also recorded for a direct comparison of
the obtained flux densities. AR Sco shows radio emission compact on
milliarcsecond angular scales ($\lesssim 0.02\ \mathrm{AU}$, or $4\
\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$). The emission is orbitally modulated, with an average flux
density of $\approx 6.5\ \mathrm{mJy}$. A comparison with the simultaneous ATCA
data shows that no flux is resolved out on mas scales, implying that the radio
emission is produced in this compact region. Additionally, the obtained radio
light curves on hour timescales are consistent with the optical light curve.
The radio emission in AR Sco is likely produced in the magnetosphere of the M
star or the white dwarf, and we see no evidence for a radio outflow or
collimated jets significantly contributing to the radio emission.

as a discrepancy metric between the distributions of source and target domains.
However, existing MMD-based domain adaptation methods generally ignore the
changes of class prior distributions, i.e., class weight bias across domains.
This remains an open problem but ubiquitous for domain adaptation, which can be
caused by changes in sample selection criteria and application scenarios. We
show that MMD cannot account for class weight bias and results in degraded
domain adaptation performance. To address this issue, a weighted MMD model is
proposed in this paper. Specifically, we introduce class-specific auxiliary
weights into the original MMD for exploiting the class prior probability on
source and target domains, whose challenge lies in the fact that the class
label in target domain is unavailable. To account for it, our proposed weighted
MMD model is defined by introducing an auxiliary weight for each class in the
source domain, and a classification EM algorithm is suggested by alternating
between assigning the pseudo-labels, estimating auxiliary weights and updating
model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
weighted MMD over conventional MMD for domain adaptation.

burning on the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism using
three-dimensional (3D) multi-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulations of an 18
solar mass progenitor. Seed asphericities in the O shell, obtained from a
recent 3D model of O shell burning, help trigger a neutrino-driven explosion
330ms after bounce whereas the shock is not revived in a model based on a
spherically symmetric progenitor for at least another 300ms. We tentatively
infer a reduction of the critical luminosity for shock revival by ~20% due to
pre-collapse perturbations. This indicates that convective seed perturbations
play an important role in the explosion mechanism in some progenitors. We
follow the evolution of the 18 solar mass model into the explosion phase for
more than 2s and find that the cycle of accretion and mass ejection is still
ongoing at this stage. With a preliminary value of 0.77 Bethe for the
diagnostic explosion energy, a baryonic neutron star mass of 1.85 solar masses,
a neutron star kick of ~600km/s and a neutron star spin period of ~20ms at the
end of the simulation, the explosion and remnant properties are slightly
atypical, but still lie comfortably within the observed distribution. Although
more refined simulations and a larger survey of progenitors are still called
for, this suggests that a solution to the problem of shock revival and
explosion energies in the ballpark of observations are within reach for
neutrino-driven explosions in 3D.

within the convective envelope of the red giant. Alternatively, the observed
phenomenon may be due to a close binary orbiting a red giant in a triple

contaminating the target pixel aperture. We identify 87 stars in the sample as
chance alignments using a combination of pixel Fourier analysis and difference
imaging. We find that in the remaining 81 cases the anomalous peaks are
indistinguishable from the target star to within 4$''$, suggesting a physical
association. We examine a Galaxia model of the $Kepler$ field of view to

disfavours SIDM for $\sigma/m_\chi=1$ cm$^2$ gr$^{-1}$, but in an intermediate
radial range ($\sim3\%$ of the virial radius), where the impact of baryonic
physics is uncertain. At this level of the cross section, we find a narrower
$\beta$ distribution in SIDM, clearly skewed towards isotropic orbits, with no
SIDM (90\% of CDM) haloes having $\beta>0.12$ at $7\%$ of the virial radius. We
estimate that with an observational sample of $\sim30$ ($\sim10^{15}$

constraints on SIDM, once observational uncertainties improve by a factor of a

only in the central halo regions ($\sim1/4$ of the scale radius of the halo),

reflected in ways similar to CDM, albeit with weaker trends.

extrasolar planets, focusing on the overlap between the planetary spectrum and
the illuminating stellar spectrum. Virtually all current models of exoplanetary
transmission spectra utilize an approximation that is inaccurate when the
spectrum of the illuminating star has a complex line structure, such as
molecular bands in M-dwarf spectra. In those cases, it is desirable to model
the observations using a coupled stellar-planetary radiative transfer model
calculated at high spectral resolving power, followed by convolution to the
observed resolution. Not consistently accounting for overlap of stellar M-dwarf
and planetary lines at high spectral resolution can bias the modeled amplitude
of the exoplanetary transmission spectrum, producing modeled absorption that is
too strong. We illustrate this bias using the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1b, as
observed using HST/WFC3. The bias in this case is about 250 parts-per-million,
12% of the modeled transit absorption. Transit spectroscopy using JWST will
have access to longer wavelengths where the water bands are intrinsically
stronger, and the observed signal-to-noise ratios will be higher than currently
possible. We therefore expect that this resolution-linked bias will be
especially important for future JWST observations of TESS-discovered
super-Earths and mini Neptunes transiting M-dwarfs.

galaxies. Very little has been said concerning other types of AGN. The purpose
of this work is to compare the circumnuclear morphologies of soft X-ray and [O

match in 100% of the type-2 Seyferts in our sample. This correspondence is less
frequent in type-1 Seyferts (22%) and it is not seen in LINERs. The good
resemblance in type-2 Seyferts constitutes an evidence for a common physical
origin. We argue that the lack of correspondence in type-1 Seyferts might be
due to the line of sight perpendicular to the accretion disk. Based on the
morphologies of the eight LINERs in our sample, we discard a common origin for
the soft X-ray and [O III] emissions in these objects. Regarding the X-ray

not have full control over the advertising transaction mechanisms). We describe
our solution and establish its soundness within the causal framework of

address practical complications (unique to the digital advertising setting)
that stem from the fact that digital advertising is targeted and measured via
identifiers (e.g., cookies, mobile advertising IDs) that may not be stable over
time. One such complication is the repeated occurrence of identifiers, leading
to interference among observations. Another is due to the possibility of
multiple identifiers being associated with the same consumer, leading to
""contamination"" with some of their identifiers being assigned to the Treatment
group and others to the Control group. Complications such as these have
severely impaired previous efforts to derive accurate measurements of lift in

insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. For instance, the
presence of a classical bulge suggests a relatively violent history, in
contrast, the presence of simply an inner disc (also referred to as a
""pseudobulge"") indicates the occurrence of secular evolution processes in the
main disc. However, we still lack criteria to effectively categorise bulges,
limiting our ability to study their impact on the evolution of the host
galaxies. Here we present a recipe to separate inner discs from classical
bulges by combining four different parameters from photometric and kinematic
analyses: The bulge S\'ersic index $n_\mathrm{b}$, the concentration index
$C_{20,50}$, the Kormendy (1977) relation and the inner slope of the radial
velocity dispersion profile $\nabla\sigma$. With that recipe we provide a
detailed bulge classification for a sample of 45 galaxies from the
integral-field spectroscopic survey CALIFA. To aid in categorising bulges
within these galaxies, we perform 2D image decomposition to determine bulge
S\'ersic index, bulge-to-total light ratio, surface brightness and effective
radius of the bulge and use growth curve analysis to derive a new concentration
index, $C_{20,50}$. We further extract the stellar kinematics from CALIFA data
cubes and analyse the radial velocity dispersion profile. The results of the
different approaches are in good agreement and allow a safe classification for
approximately $95\%$ of the galaxies. In particular, we show that our new
""inner"" concentration index performs considerably better than the traditionally
used $C_{50,90}$ when yielding the nature of bulges. We also found that a
combined use of this index and the Kormendy (1977) relation gives a very robust
indication of the physical nature of the bulge.

circularly-translated versions of itself, called multireference alignment
(MRA). One natural approach to MRA could be to estimate the shifts of the
observations first, and infer the signal by aligning and averaging the data. In
contrast, we consider a method based on estimating the signal directly, using
features of the signal that are invariant under translations. Specifically, we
estimate the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the signal from the
observations. Under mild assumptions, these invariant features contain enough
information to infer the signal. In particular, the bispectrum can be used to
estimate the Fourier phases. To this end, we propose and analyze a few
algorithms. Our main methods consist of non-convex optimization over the smooth
manifold of phases. Empirically, in the absence of noise, these non-convex
algorithms appear to converge to the target signal with random initialization.
The algorithms are also robust to noise. We then suggest three additional
methods. These methods are based on frequency marching, semidefinite relaxation
and integer programming. The first two methods provably recover the phases
exactly in the absence of noise. In the high noise level regime, the invariant
features approach for MRA results in stable estimation if the number of
measurements scales like the cube of the noise variance, which is the
information-theoretic rate. Additionally, it requires only one pass over the
data which is important at low signal-to-noise ratio when the number of
observations must be large.

black hole (SMBH) in a circular extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), a phase of
steady mass transfer ensues. Over millions of years, the binary evolves to a
period minimum before reversing course and migrating outwards. Because the time
interval between consecutive EMRIs is comparable to the mass-transfer
timescale, the semi-major axes of two consecutive mass-transferring EMRIs will
cross on a radial scale < few AU. We show that such EMRI crossing events are
inevitably accompanied by a series of mildly relativistic, grazing physical
collisions between the stars. Each collision strips a small quantity of mass,
primarily from the more massive star, which generally increases their radial
separation to set up the next collision after a delay of decades to centuries
(or longer) set by further gravitational radiation. Depending on the mass of
the SMBH, this interaction can result in N ~ 1-1e4 gas production events of
mass Msun/N, thus powering a quasi-periodic sequence of SMBH accretion-powered
flares over a total duration of thousands of years or longer. Although the EMRI
rate is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of tidal disruption events
(TDE), the ability of a single interacting EMRI pair to produce a large number
of luminous flares - and to make more judicious use of the available stellar
fuel - could make their observed rate competitive with the TDE rate, enabling
them to masquerade as ""TDE Imposters."" We predict flares with luminosities that
decay both as power laws shallower than t^(-5/3) or as decaying exponentials.
Viscous spreading of the gas disks produced by the accumulation of previous
mass-stripping events places substantial mass on radial scales > 10-100 AU,
providing a reprocessing source required to explain the unexpectedly high
optical luminosities of some flares.

context as populations of most North American species are below historic levels
and European studies suggest OWEDs. We modelled species occupancy using a
generalized additive model and conditional abundance with generalized additive
models for location, scale, and shape; the models were subsequently combined to
estimate unconditional abundance. We demonstrate this flexible, model-based
approach using sea ducks (Common Eider [Somateria mollissima], Black Scoter
[Melanitta americana], Surf Scoter [M. perspicillata], White-winged Scoter [M.

Massachusetts, USA, which supports some of the largest concentrations of
wintering sea ducks in eastern North America and where a 454-MW OWED is
proposed. Our approach to species distribution and abundance modelling offers
several useful features including (1) the ability to model all conditional
distribution parameters as a function of covariates, (2) integrated variable
reduction and selection among many covariates, (3) integrated model selection,
and (4) the efficient incorporation of smooth effects to capture spatiotemporal
trends poorly explained by other covariates. This modelling approach should
prove useful for marine spatial planners in siting OWEDs while considering key
habitats and areas potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors. Moreover,
the approach is equally suitable for terrestrial or aquatic systems.

there is a strong anti-correlation of [CII]/FIR with NUV-K seen in both spirals

to ionize carbon and heat the gas. The correlation thus makes a [CII] deficit
in galaxies with redder stellar populations. The high [NII] 122/[CII] (and low

Dark energy plays an important role to the structure formation and the effects

the most promising and simplest dark energy model is the $ \Lambda $CDM.
However, it is worth investigating different dark energy models with evolving

packet in the ground state, with optimized amplitudes and phases, can be used
to enhance the yield of the reaction at faster rates, exploring how the
geometrical restrictions induced by the symmetry of the system impose
limitations in the optimization procedure. As an example we model the
isomerization in an oriented 2,2'-dimethyl biphenyl molecule with a simple
quartic potential. Using long (picosecond) pulses we find that the
isomerization can be achieved driven by a single pulse. The phase of the
initial superposition state does not affect the yield. However, using short
(femtosecond) pulses, one always needs a pair of pulses to force the reaction.
High yields can only be obtained by optimizing both the initial state, and the
wave packet prepared in the excited state, implying the well known pump-dump
mechanism.

then released in a supernova explosion. The basic picture of this explosion was
confirmed by the few neutrinos detected from the SN1987a supernova at
Kamiokande, IMB and Baksan detectors. However, there are many details that are
still unknown. Since then, a large detector network has grown with better
capabilities. Nowadays, in the case of a supernova explosion in our galaxy, the

with the number of variables and constraints on the order of the number of
links times the number of scenarios. Small and medium size problems are within
the capabilities of generic linear program solvers. We develop a more scalable,
distributed algorithm for the problem that alternates between solving (in
parallel) one flow problem per scenario, and coordination steps, which connect
the individual flows and the reservation capacities.

similarity matrix computation and subsequent spectral clustering. However,
similarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many
factors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of
data, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not
suitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition,
nonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has
not been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two
challenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix
and similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show
theoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering
methods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most
suitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model
with a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can
automatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator
matrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of
multiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks
in a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the
results of the others towards an overall optimal solution. Extensive
experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted
by malware for a PDoS attack. To model the recruitment of bots, we extend a
traditional game-theoretic concept and create a ""Poisson signaling game."" Then
we analyze two different mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet
recruitment. We find that 1) defenders can bound botnet activity and 2)
legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while
incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This
work provides a quantitative foundation for designing proactive defense against

broad range of colours and a low binary fraction of ~10% cold classical Kuiper
belt objects typically have red optical colours with ~30% of the population
found in binary pairs; the origin of these differences remains unclear. We
report the detection of a population of blue-coloured, tenuously bound binaries
residing among the cold classical Kuiper belt objects. Here we show that widely
separated binaries could have survived push-out into the cold classical region
during the early phases of Neptune's migration. The blue binaries may be
contaminants, originating at ~38 au, and could provide a unique probe of the
formative conditions in a region now nearly devoid of objects. The idea that
the blue objects, which are predominantly binary, are the products of push-out
requires that the planetesimals formed entirely as multiples. Plausible
formation routes include planetesimal formation via pebble accretion and
subsequent binary production through dynamic friction and binary formation
during the collapse of a cloud of solids.

conventional counterparts. However, large-scale universal quantum computers are
yet to be built. Boson sampling is a rudimentary quantum algorithm tailored to
the platform of photons in linear optics, which has sparked interest as a rapid
way to demonstrate this quantum supremacy. Photon statistics are governed by
intractable matrix functions known as permanents, which suggests that sampling
from the distribution obtained by injecting photons into a linear-optical
network could be solved more quickly by a photonic experiment than by a
classical computer. The contrast between the apparently awesome challenge faced
by any classical sampling algorithm and the apparently near-term experimental
resources required for a large boson sampling experiment has raised
expectations that quantum supremacy by boson sampling is on the horizon. Here
we present classical boson sampling algorithms and theoretical analyses of
prospects for scaling boson sampling experiments, showing that near-term
quantum supremacy via boson sampling is unlikely. While the largest boson
sampling experiments reported so far are with 5 photons, our classical
algorithm, based on Metropolised independence sampling (MIS), allowed the boson
sampling problem to be solved for 30 photons with standard computing hardware.
We argue that the impact of experimental photon losses means that demonstrating
quantum supremacy by boson sampling would require a step change in technology.

our method incorporates a natural regularization functional to avoid

($PL$), period-Wesenheit ($PW$) relations for classical and Type II Cepheids
and infrared $PL$, $PL$-metallicity ($PLZ$) and optical luminosity-metallicity
($M_V$-[Fe/H]) relations for the RR Lyrae stars, with zero points based on
TGAS. The new relations were computed using multi-band
($V,I,J,K_{\mathrm{s}},W_{1}$) photometry and spectroscopic metal abundances
available in the literature, and applying three alternative approaches: (i) by
linear least squares fitting the absolute magnitudes inferred from direct
transformation of the TGAS parallaxes, (ii) by adopting astrometric-based
luminosities, and (iii) using a Bayesian fitting approach. TGAS parallaxes
bring a significant added value to the previous Hipparcos estimates. The
relations presented in this paper represent first Gaia-calibrated relations and
form a ""work-in-progress"" milestone report in the wait for Gaia-only parallaxes
of which a first solution will become available with Gaia's Data Release 2
(DR2) in 2018.

multivariate spatial point patterns. This methodology develops high dimensional
data understanding in the point process setting. The method is based on
modelling the patterns using a flexible Gibbs point process model to directly
characterise point-to-point interactions at different spatial scales. By using
the Gibbs framework significant interactions can also be captured at small
scales. Subsequently, the Gibbs point process is fitted using a
pseudo-likelihood approximation, and we select significant interactions
automatically using the group lasso penalty with this likelihood approximation.
Thus we estimate the multivariate interactions stably even in this setting. We
demonstrate the feasibility of the method with a simulation study and show its
power by applying it to a large and complex rainforest plant population data

of extreme phenomena associated with supermassive black holes including
relativistic jets, binary supermassive black holes, or even recoiling
supermassive black holes. However, the multi-wavelength structure of active
galaxies at a few milliarcseconds cannot be fathomed with direct observations.
We propose using strong gravitational lensing to elucidate the multi-wavelength
structure of sources. When sources are located close to the caustic of lensing
galaxy, even small offset in the position of the sources results in a drastic
difference in the position and magnification of mirage images. We show that the
angular offset in the position of the sources can be amplified more than 50
times in the observed position of mirage images. We find that at least 8% of
the observed gravitationally lensed quasars will be in the caustic
configuration. The synergy between SKA and Euclid will provide an ideal set of
observations for thousands of gravitationally lensed sources in the caustic
configuration, which will allow us to elucidate the multi-wavelength structure
for a large ensemble of sources, and study the physical origin of radio
emissions, their connection to supermassive black holes, and their cosmic
evolution.

instantaneous losses to other banks, possibly triggering a cascade of defaults.
The strength of this interaction is determined by the level of the so-called
non-core exposure. We show that, when the size of the system becomes large, the
cumulative loss process of a bank resulting from the defaults of other banks
exhibits discontinuities. These discontinuities are naturally interpreted as
systemic events, and we characterize them explicitly in terms of the level of
non-core exposure and the fraction of banks that are ""about to default"". The
main mathematical challenges of our work stem from the very singular nature of
the interaction between the particles, which is inherited by the limiting
system. A similar particle system is analyzed in [DIRT15a] and [DIRT15b], and

occurring within the deuteron, and 23 events are observed against a background

Alternatively, a lower limit on the nuclear lifetime was found to be

various models are also provided in this article. This is the first search for

words. This paper classifies the slopes of lines of sight, lines that pass
through each doorway, for both the case of a finite number of parallel hallways

produce a metric on configurations with an infinite number of hallways that

this metric to $\mathbb R$, we produce the Baire metric under which the

distribution of cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the wireless access
network, enabling rich services and applications in close proximity to the end
users. In this article, a MEC enabled multi-cell wireless network is considered
where each Base Station (BS) is equipped with a MEC server that can assist
mobile users in executing computation-intensive tasks via task offloading. The
problem of Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation (JTORA) is studied in
order to maximize the users' task offloading gains, which is measured by the
reduction in task completion time and energy consumption. The considered
problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-linear Program (MINLP) that
involves jointly optimizing the task offloading decision, uplink transmission
power of mobile users, and computing resource allocation at the MEC servers.
Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, solving for optimal solution is
difficult and impractical for a large-scale network. To overcome this drawback,
our approach is to decompose the original problem into (i) a Resource
Allocation (RA) problem with fixed task offloading decision and (ii) a Task
Offloading (TO) problem that optimizes the optimal-value function corresponding
to the RA problem. We address the RA problem using convex and quasi-convex
optimization techniques, and propose a novel heuristic algorithm to the TO
problem that achieves a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical
simulation results show that our algorithm performs closely to the optimal
solution and that it significantly improves the users' offloading utility over
traditional approaches.

interconnected microtubules to linear and triangular geometries to perform
micro-rheology by defined oscillations of the beads relative to each other. We
found a substantial stiffening of single filaments above a characteristic
transition frequency of 1-30 Hz depending on the filament's molecular
composition. Below this frequency, filament elasticity only depends on its
contour and persistence length. Interestingly, this elastic behavior is
transferable to small networks, where we found the surprising effect that
linear two filament connections act as transistor-like, angle dependent
momentum filters, whereas triangular networks act as stabilizing elements.
These observations implicate that cells can tune mechanical signals by temporal
and spatial filtering stronger and more flexibly than expected.

field stars as a baseline for relative photometry, we are able to construct a
light curve of the nucleus in the g-prime and r-prime band with 1sigma=36
milli-mag photometric stability. We derive a temporal power spectrum for the
nucleus and find no evidence for a time-variable signal above the noise as
would be expected if the nuclear black hole were accreting gas. Thus, we are
unable to constrain the spin of the black hole although future work will use
this powerful instrument to target more actively accreting black holes. Given
the black hole mass of (2.5+/-0.5)*10^6 Msun inferred from stellar kinematics,
the absence of a contribution from a nuclear time-variable signal places an
upper limit on the accretion rate which is 4.6*10^{-8} of the Eddington rate, a
factor of two more stringent than past upper limits from HST. The low mass of
the black hole despite the high stellar density suggests that the gas liberated
by stellar interactions was primarily at early cosmic times when the low-mass
black hole had a small Eddington luminosity. This is at least partly driven by
a top-heavy stellar initial mass function at early cosmic times which is an
efficient producer of stellar mass black holes. The implication is that
supermassive black holes likely arise from seeds formed through the coalescence
of 3-100 Msun mass black holes that then accrete gas produced through stellar
interaction processes.

remains a mystery due to its seemingly insurmountable intricacies. Recently Xie

measured intrinsic ferromagneticity, and thus named it MagR. However, Meister's
calculations showed that the interaction energy of the magnetic moment of IscA1
with Earth's magnetic field is five magnitudes smaller than thermal fluctuation
at room temperature. The other long-proposed compass protein is cryptochrome
(Cry) with a mechanism of forming singlet-triplet radical pairs. However, this
sensory mechanism still has no inferable information transmission routes. We
propose a magnetoreception mechanism involving both the Cry and IscA1 proteins,
through which photoinduced electrons are transported to redox-regulated ion
channels to provoke neuronal responses. The structural features of the
Cry-IscA1 complex that make it suitable for long-range electron transfer are
discussed and how the magnetic effect leads to neuronal activity is described.

  Classification",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-label text classification is a popular machine learning task where each
document is assigned with multiple relevant labels. This task is challenging
due to high dimensional features and correlated labels. Multi-label text
classifiers need to be carefully regularized to prevent the severe over-fitting
in the high dimensional space, and also need to take into account label
dependencies in order to make accurate predictions under uncertainty. We
demonstrate significant and practical improvement by carefully regularizing the
model complexity during training phase, and also regularizing the label search
space during prediction phase. Specifically, we regularize the classifier
training using Elastic-net (L1+L2) penalty for reducing model complexity/size,
and employ early stopping to prevent overfitting. At prediction time, we apply
support inference to restrict the search space to label sets encountered in the
training set, and F-optimizer GFM to make optimal predictions for the F1
metric. We show that although support inference only provides density
estimations on existing label combinations, when combined with GFM predictor,
the algorithm can output unseen label combinations. Taken collectively, our
experiments show state of the art results on many benchmark datasets. Beyond
performance and practical contributions, we make some interesting observations.
Contrary to the prior belief, which deems support inference as purely an
approximate inference procedure, we show that support inference acts as a
strong regularizer on the label prediction structure. It allows the classifier
to take into account label dependencies during prediction even if the
classifiers had not modeled any label dependencies during training.

configurations acquired from the experiment. Tracking these fluctuations serves
as a highly sensitive tool in signaling the onset of the Martensitic transition
and precisely locating particle rearrangements occurring at length scales of a
few particle diameters. Particle rearrangements associated with non-affine
displacement modes become increasingly favorable during the transformation
process. The nature of the displacement fluctuation modes that govern the

is combined with the \emph{Planck} 143 GHz data in harmonic space, to obtain a
temperature map that has a broader $\ell$ coverage and less noise than either

temperature map, we produce a map of the gravitational lensing potential
projected along the line of sight. We measure the auto-spectrum of the lensing
potential $C_{L}^{\phi\phi}$, and compare it to the theoretical prediction for
a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology consistent with the \emph{Planck} 2015 data set,
finding a best-fit amplitude of $0.95_{-0.06}^{+0.06}({\rm Stat.})\!

a significance of $24\,\sigma$. One important use of such a lensing potential

this cross-correlation in practice by calculating the cross-spectrum,
$C_{L}^{\phi G}$, between the SPT+\emph{Planck} lensing map and Wide-field

power law of the form $p_{L}=a(L/L_{0})^{-b}$ with $a=2.15 \times 10^{-8}$,
$b=1.35$, $L_{0}=490$, and find $\eta^{\phi G}=0.94^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, which is
marginally lower, but in good agreement with $\eta^{\phi

not learn, or to retrain the machine again with a selection of the historic
data. While these hacks work to various degrees, they do not adhere to the

be achieved. We further put our strategy to test on challenging cases,
including cross-domain increments and incrementing on a novel label space. We

encapsulates the likely trajectories, up to some probability threshold, by
optimally rejecting outliers in the dataset. This tool provides set predictions
consisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors
of the human driven car, and can account for modes of behavior, like the driver
state or intent. This allows us to predict driving behavior over long time
horizons with high accuracy. By using this realistic data and flexible
algorithm, a precise and accurate driver model can be developed to capture
likely behaviors. The resulting prediction can be tailored to an individual for
use in semi-autonomous frameworks or generally applied for autonomous planning
in interactive maneuvers.

a smooth non-singular behavior at the Dirac points and the points where the

records, recently categorical transaction clustering is received more
attention. In this research, we study the problem of categorical data
clustering for transactional data characterized with high dimensionality and
large volume. We propose a novel algorithm for clustering transactional data
called F-Tree, which is based on the idea of the frequent pattern algorithm
FP-tree; the fastest approaches to the frequent item set mining. And the simple
idea behind the F-Tree is to generate small high pure clusters, and then merge
them. That makes it fast, and dynamic in clustering large transactional
datasets with high dimensions. We also present a new solution to solve the
overlapping problem between clusters, by defining a new criterion function,
which is based on the probability of overlapping between weighted items. Our
experimental evaluation on real datasets shows that: Firstly, F-Tree is
effective in finding interesting clusters. Secondly, the usage of the tree
structure reduces the clustering process time of the large data set with high
attributes. Thirdly, the proposed evaluation metric used efficiently to solve
the overlapping of transaction items generates high-quality clustering results.
Finally, we have concluded that the process of merging pure and small clusters
increases the purity of resulted clusters as well as it reduces the time of
clustering better than the process of generating clusters directly from dataset
then refine clusters.

Networks (WSNs) for ensuring secure data sessions. Sensor node authentication
ensures the confidentiality and validity of data collected by the sensor node,

the sensor data. In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network
and exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication
process multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT)
brings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security
requirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish
multiple concurrent secure data sessions. With concurrent data sessions, the
frequency of the re-authentication process increases in proportion to the
number of concurrent connections, which makes the security issue even more
challenging. The currently available authentication protocols were designed for
the autonomous WSN and do not account for the above requirements. In this
paper, we present a novel, lightweight and efficient key exchange and
authentication protocol suite called the Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN)
Authentication Protocol. In the SMSN a mobile node goes through an initial
authentication procedure and receives a re-authentication ticket from the base
station. Later a mobile node can use this re-authentication ticket when
establishing multiple data exchange sessions and/or when moving across the
network. This scheme reduces the communication and computational complexity of
the authentication process. We proved the strength of our protocol with
rigorous security analysis and simulated the SMSN and previously proposed
schemes in an automated protocol verifier tool. Finally, we compared the
computational complexity and communication cost against well-known

known to be responsible for non-trivial spin configurations and a number of
emergent physical phenomena. Ferroelectric materials may be especially
interesting in this regard due to reversible spontaneous polarization making
possible for a non-volatile electrical control of the spin degrees of freedom.
Here, we explore a technologically relevant oxide material, HfO2, which has
been shown to exhibit robust ferroelectricity in a non-centrosymmetric
orthorhombic phase. Using theoretical modelling based on density-functional
theory, we investigate the spin-dependent electronic structure of the
ferroelectric HfO2 and demonstrate the appearance of chiral spin textures
driven by spin-orbit coupling. We analyze these spin configurations in terms of
the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects within the k.p Hamiltonian model and find
that the Rashba-type spin texture dominates around the valence band maximum,
while the Dresselhaus-type spin texture prevails around the conduction band
minimum. The latter is characterized by a very large Dresselhaus constant
{\alpha}D = 0.578 eV {\AA}, which allows using this material as a tunnel
barrier to produce tunneling anomalous and spin Hall effects that are
reversible by ferroelectric polarization.

retina lesions and DR severity appear with different scales in fundus images,
the integration of both local and global networks learn more complete and

relative importance of spiral shocks and the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) in driving angular momentum transport and how each depend on the geometry
and strength of seed magnetic field and the Mach number of the disk (where Mach
number is ratio of the azimuthal velocity and the sound speed of gas). We use a
locally isothermal equation of state and adopt temperature profiles that are
consistent with CV disk observations. Our results indicate that the relative
importance of spiral shocks and MRI in driving angular momentum transport is
controlled by the gas Mach number and the seed magnetic field strength. MRI and
spiral shocks provide comparable efficiency of angular momentum transport when
the disk Mach number is around 10 and the seed magnetic field has plasma
$\beta=400$ (where $\beta$ is ratio of gas pressure and magnetic pressure). The
MRI dominates whenever the seed field strength, or the disk Mach number, is
increased. Among all of our simulations, the effective viscosity parameter
$\alpha_{eff} \sim 0.016-0.1$ after MRI saturates and the disk reaches steady
state. Larger values of $\alpha_{eff}$ are favored when the seed magnetic field
has vertical components or the flow has stronger magnetization ($1/\beta$). Our
models all indicate that the role of MRI in driving angular momentum transport
thus mass accretion in CV disks is indispensable, especially in cool disks with
weak spiral shocks.

derived by using inequalities of matrix eigen-values. By simulation and
analysis, the upper lower bound is shown to be close to the exact value of MSE
gain as the ratio of the number N of total subcarriers to the cyclic prefix
length L grows and the correlation factor of colored interference increases.
More importantly, we also find that the MSE gain varies from one to N/L as the
correlation among colored interferences decreases gradually. According to
theoretical analysis, we also find the MSE gain has very simple forms in two
extreme scenarios. In the first extreme case that the colored interferences
over all subchannels are fully correlated, i.e., their covariance matrix is a
matrix of all-ones, the sum-MSE gain reduces to 1. In other words, there is no
performance gain. In the second extreme case that the colored-interference
covariance matrix is an identity matrix, i.e, they are mutually independent,
the achievable sum-MSE performance gain is N/L. A large ratio N/L will achieve
a significant sum-MSE gain.

factor of at least ~100 to be consistent with the observational upper limits

assumed. As a continuation of previous ideas, we propose that the underlying
reason for the depletion of oxygen (hence the low detection rate) is the
freeze-out of volatiles such as water and CO onto dust grains followed by grain
growth and settling/migration, which permanently removes these gas-phase
molecules from the emissive upper layers of the outer disk. Such depletion of
volatiles is likely ubiquitous among different disks, though not necessarily to
the same degree. The volatiles might be returned back to the gas phase in the
inner disk (within about 15 AU), which is consistent with current constraints.
Comparison with studies on disk dispersal due to photoevaporation indicates
that the timescale for volatile depletion is shorter than that of
photoevaporation.

linear observation model. Each sensor makes a scalar noisy observation of the
unknown vector, quantizes its observation, maps it to a digitally modulated
symbol, and transmits the symbol over orthogonal power-constrained fading
channels to a fusion center (FC). The FC is tasked with fusing the received
signals from sensors and estimating the unknown vector. We derive the Bayesian
Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for three types of receivers: (i) coherent
receiver (ii) noncoherent receiver with known channel envelopes (iii)
noncoherent receiver with known channel statistics only. We also derive the
Weiss-Weinstein bound (WWB). We formulate two constrained optimization
problems, namely maximizing trace and log-determinant of Bayesian FIM under
network transmit power constraint, with sensors transmit powers being the
optimization variables. We show that for coherent receiver, these problems are
concave. However, for noncoherent receivers, they are not necessarily concave.
The solution to the trace of Bayesian FIM maximization problem can be
implemented in a distributed fashion. We numerically investigate how the
FIM-max power allocation across sensors depends on the sensors observation
qualities and physical layer parameters as well as the network transmit power
constraint. Moreover, we evaluate the system performance in terms of MSE using
the solutions of FIM-max schemes, and compare it with the solution obtained
from minimizing the MSE of the LMMSE estimator (MSE-min scheme), and that of
uniform power allocation. These comparisons illustrate that, although the WWB
is tighter than the inverse of Bayesian FIM, it is still suitable to use
FIM-max schemes, since the performance loss in terms of the MSE of the LMMSE
estimator is not significant.

same sector breaks the gauge symmetry and SUSY. In general, the SUSY breaking
model without gauge symmetry has a flat direction at the minimum of F-term
scalar potential. When we introduce U(1) gauge symmetry to such a SUSY breaking
model, there can appear a runaway direction. Such a runway direction can be
lifted by loop effects, and the gauge symmetry breaking and SUSY breaking are
realized. The R-symmetry, that is assigned to break SUSY, is also spontaneously
broken at the vacuum. This scenario can be extended to non-Abelian gauge
theories. We also discuss application to the Pati-Salam model and the SU(5)

November 06 to 2016 February 14 in the BVR and I broadbands using 1.2m
telescope of the Mt. Abu InfraRed Observatory (MIRO). The source was observed
on 160 nights out of which on 89 nights it was monitored for more than 1 hr to
check for the presence of any intra-day variability (IDV). The blazar 3C 66A
exhibited significant variations in the optical flux on short and long term
time scales. However, unlike highly variable S5 0716+71, it showed IDV duty
cycle of about 8% only. Our statistical studies suggest the IDV time scales
ranging from $\sim$ 37 min to about 3.12 hours and, in one case, a possibility
of the quasi-periodic variations with characteristic timescale of $\sim$ 1.4
hrs. The IDV amplitudes in R$-$band were found to vary from 0.03 mag to as much
as 0.6 mag, with larger amplitude of variation when the source was relatively
fainter. The typical rate of the flux variation was estimated to be $\sim$0.07
mag hr$^{-1}$ in both, the rising and the falling phases. However, the rates of
the brightness variation as high as 1.38 mag/hr were also detected. The
shortest timescale of the variation, 37 min, sets an upper limit of $6.92
\times 10^{14}$ cm on the size of the emission region and about $3.7 \times
10^8\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ as an estimate of the mass of the black hole,
assuming the origin of the rapid optical variability is in close vicinity of
the central SMBH. The long-term study suggests a mild bluer-when-brighter
behavior, typical for BL Lacs.

identify what caused it in order to repair the code that induced the incorrect
behavior. Until a permanent repair is afforded, code repair patches are
invaluable. The aim of this work is to devise an automated patch generation
technique that proceeds as follows: Step1) It identifies a set of
failure-causing control dependence chains that are minimal in terms of number
and length. Step2) It identifies a set of predicates within the chains along
with associated execution instances, such that negating the predicates at the
given instances would exhibit correct behavior. Step3) For each candidate
predicate, it creates a classifier that dictates when the predicate should be
negated to yield correct program behavior. Step4) Prior to each candidate
predicate, the faulty program is injected with a call to its corresponding
classifier passing it the program state and getting a return value predictively
indicating whether to negate the predicate or not. The role of the classifiers
is to ensure that: 1) the predicates are not negated during passing runs; and
2) the predicates are negated at the appropriate instances within failing runs.
We implemented our patch generation approach for the Java platform and
evaluated our toolset using 148 defects from the Introclass and Siemens
benchmarks. The toolset identified 56 full patches and another 46 partial
patches, and the classification accuracy averaged 84%.

Such approximations allow us to use off-the-shelf semidefinite optimization

store, and process information. A major challenge in this field is to look for
an efficient means for classifying quantum state. For instance, one may want to
determine if a given quantum state is entangled or not. However, the process of
a complete characterization of quantum states, known as quantum state
tomography, is a resource-consuming operation in general. An attractive
proposal would be the use of Bell's inequalities as an entanglement witness,
where only partial information of the quantum state is needed. The problem is
that entanglement is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell's
inequalities, making it an unreliable state classifier. Here we aim at solving
this problem by the methods of machine learning. More precisely, given a family
of quantum states, we randomly picked a subset of it to construct a
quantum-state classifier, accepting only partial information of each quantum
state. Our results indicated that these transformed Bell-type inequalities can
perform significantly better than the original Bell's inequalities in
classifying entangled states. We further extended our analysis to three-qubit
and four-qubit systems, performing classification of quantum states into
multiple species. These results demonstrate how the tools in machine learning
can be applied to solving problems in quantum information science.

recognition? Larson and Loschky (2009) showed that peripheral vision
contributes more than central vision in obtaining maximum scene recognition
accuracy. However, central vision is more efficient for scene recognition than
peripheral, based on the amount of visual area needed for accurate recognition.
In this study, we model and explain the results of Larson and Loschky (2009)
using a neurocomputational modeling approach. We show that the advantage of
peripheral vision in scene recognition, as well as the efficiency advantage for
central vision, can be replicated using state-of-the-art deep neural network
models. In addition, we propose and provide support for the hypothesis that the
peripheral advantage comes from the inherent usefulness of peripheral features.
This result is consistent with data presented by Thibaut, Tran, Szaffarczyk,
and Boucart (2014), who showed that patients with central vision loss can still
categorize natural scenes efficiently. Furthermore, by using a deep
mixture-of-experts model (""The Deep Model,"" or TDM) that receives central and
peripheral visual information on separate channels simultaneously, we show that
the peripheral advantage emerges naturally in the learning process: When
trained to categorize scenes, the model weights the peripheral pathway more
than the central pathway. As we have seen in our previous modeling work,
learning creates a transform that spreads different scene categories into
different regions in representational space. Finally, we visualize the features
for the two pathways, and find that different preferences for scene categories
emerge for the two pathways during the training process.

instantaneous, Lorentz-boosted Pulse Co-Moving Frame (PCMF), a new quasi-static
theory is developed to describe the nonlinear pulse evolutions due to the
wakefield excitation, and is verified through comparison with particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulations. According to this theory, the plasma-motion can be treated
perturbatively and produces quasi-static wakefield in the PCMF, and the pulse
envelope is governed by a form of the Schrodinger equation. The pulse
evolutions are characterized by local conservation laws resulted from this
equation and subjected to Lorentz transformation into the laboratory frame. In
this context, new formulas describing the time-behaviors of group velocity,
wake amplitude and carrier frequency are derived and best confirmed by
simulation data. The spectral evolutions of the radiation are described based
on the properties of the Schrodinger equation, predicting the emergence of a
new extra-ordinary dispersion branch with linear relation w=ck (c is the light
speed) approved by simulations.

properties when the truth is sparse. While optimization-based algorithms for
the extremely popular Lasso and elastic net procedures can scale to dimension
in the hundreds of thousands, algorithms for the horseshoe that use Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for computation are limited to problems an order of
magnitude smaller. This is due to high computational cost per step and growth
of the variance of time-averaging estimators as a function of dimension. We
propose two new MCMC algorithms for computation in these models that have
improved performance compared to existing alternatives. One of the algorithms
also approximates an expensive matrix product to give orders of magnitude
speedup in high-dimensional applications. We prove that the exact algorithm is
geometrically ergodic, and give guarantees for the accuracy of the approximate
algorithm using perturbation theory. Versions of the approximation algorithm
that gradually decrease the approximation error as the chain extends are shown
to be exact. The scalability of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations
with problem size as large as $N=5,000$ observations and $p=50,000$ predictors,
and an application to a genome-wide association study with $N=2,267$ and
$p=98,385$. The empirical results also show that the new algorithm yields
estimates with lower mean squared error, intervals with better coverage, and
elucidates features of the posterior that were often missed by previous
algorithms in high dimensions, including bimodality of posterior marginals
indicating uncertainty about which covariates belong in the model.

So far, however, most of the theoretical work in the study of non-equilibrium

quenches in nested integrable systems, by generalizing the application of the

simple matrix product state for which the overlaps with the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian are known. We fully characterize the post-quench steady state and
perform several consistency checks for the validity of our results. Finally, we
provide predictions for the propagation of entanglement and mutual information

zeta-function and the summatory function $M(x)$ of the M\""obius function. The
purpose of this paper is to consider two open problems under some conjectures.
One is that whether all zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are simple or not.
The other problem is that whether $M(x) \ll x^{1/2}$ holds or not. First, we
consider the former problem. It is known that the assertion $M(x) =
o(x^{1/2}\log{x})$ is a sufficient condition for the proof of the simplicity of
zeros. However, proving this assertion is presently difficult.%at present.
Therefore, we consider another sufficient condition for the simplicity of zeros
that is weaker than the above assertion in terms of the Riesz mean $M_{\tau}(x)
= {\Gamma(1+\tau)}^{-1}\sum_{n \leq x}\mu(n)(1 - \frac{n}{x})^{\tau}$. We
conclude that the assertion $M_{\tau}(x) = o(x^{1/2}\log{x})$ for a
non-negative fixed $\tau$ is a sufficient condition for the simplicity of
zeros. Also, we obtain an explicit formula for $M_{\tau}(x)$. By observing the
formula, we propose a conjecture, in which $\tau$ is not fixed, but depends on
$x$. This conjecture also gives a sufficient condition, which seems easier to
approach, for the simplicity of zeros. Next, we consider the latter problem.
Many mathematicians believe that the estimate $ M(x) \ll x^{1/2}$ fails, but
this is not yet disproved. In this paper we study the mean values
$\int_{1}^{x}\frac{M(u)}{u^{\kappa}}du$ for any real $\kappa$ under the weak
Mertens Hypothesis $\int_{1}^{x}( M(u)/u)^2du \ll \log{x}$. We obtain the upper
bound of $\int_{1}^{x}\frac{M(u)}{u^{\kappa}}du$ under the weak Mertens
Hypothesis. We also have $\Omega$-result of this integral unconditionally, and
so we find that the upper bound which is obtained in this paper of this
integral is the best possible estimation.

challenge mainly lies in the analog component which consists of a network of
phase shifters. The partially-connected structure employs a small number of
phase shifters and therefore serves as an energy efficient solution for hybrid
precoding. In this paper, we propose a double phase shifter (DPS)
implementation for the phase shifter network in the partially-connected

particular, the hybrid precoder design is identified as an eigenvalue problem.
To further enhance the performance, dynamic mapping from radio frequency (RF)
chains to antennas is proposed, for which a greedy algorithm and a modified

Rydberg-Stark states of principal quantum number $n$ selected in the range

are deflected using a surface-electrode Rydberg-Stark deflector. The collision
energies of the merged beams are determined by measuring the velocity
distributions of the two beams and they are adjusted by changing the
temperature of the pulsed valve used to generate the ground-state ${\rm H}_2$
beam and by adapting the electric-potential functions to the electrodes of the
deflector. The collision energy is varied down to below $E_{\rm col}/k_{\rm B}=
10$ K, i.e., below $E_{\rm col}\approx 1$ meV, with an energy resolution of 100

supervised learning, which requires the tedious manual annotation of object
location in a training set. Recently there has been an increasing interest in
developing weakly supervised approach to detector training where the object
location is not manually annotated but automatically determined based on binary
(weak) labels indicating if a training image contains the object. This is a
challenging problem because each image can contain many candidate object
locations which partially overlaps the object of interest. Existing approaches
focus on how to best utilise the binary labels for object location annotation.
In this paper we propose to solve this problem from a very different
perspective by casting it as a transfer learning problem. Specifically, we
formulate a novel transfer learning based on learning to rank, which
effectively transfers a model for automatic annotation of object location from

analyse an algorithm for the construction of an approximation using only point
evaluations of a multivariate function, or evaluations of some entries of a
multidimensional array. The algorithm is a variant of higher-order singular
value decomposition which constructs a hierarchy of subspaces associated with
the different nodes of the tree and a corresponding hierarchy of interpolation
operators. Optimal subspaces are estimated using empirical principal component
analysis of interpolations of partial random evaluations of the function. The
algorithm is able to provide an approximation in any tree-based format with
either a prescribed rank or a prescribed relative error, with a number of
evaluations of the order of the storage complexity of the approximation format.
Under some assumptions on the estimation of principal components, we prove that
the algorithm provides either a quasi-optimal approximation with a given rank,
or an approximation satisfying the prescribed relative error, up to constants
depending on the tree and the properties of interpolation operators. The
analysis takes into account the discretization errors for the approximation of
infinite-dimensional tensors. Several numerical examples illustrate the main
results and the behavior of the algorithm for the approximation of
high-dimensional functions using hierarchical Tucker or tensor train tensor
formats, and the approximation of univariate functions using tensorization.

possible binarity by looking for the light-time travel effect (LITE).
Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRD) are constructed and compared to evolutionary
tracks and theoretical instability strips (ISs). In agreement with previous

that stars exist with luminosities below that predicted from single-star

and its resolving capability. Having a large NA is a very desirable quality for
applications requiring small light-matter interaction volumes or large angular
collections. Traditionally, a large NA lens based on light refraction requires
precision bulk optics that ends up being expensive and is thus also a specialty
item. In contrast, metasurfaces allow the lens designer to circumvent those
issues producing high NA lenses in an ultra-flat fashion. However, so far,
these have been limited to numerical apertures on the same order of traditional
optical components, with experimentally reported values of NA <0.9. Here we
demonstrate, both numerically and experimentally, a new approach that results
in a diffraction limited flat lens with a near-unity numerical aperture
(NA>0.99) and sub-wavelength thickness (~{\lambda}/3), operating with
unpolarized light at 715 nm. To demonstrate its imaging capability, the
designed lens is applied in a confocal configuration to map color centers in
sub-diffractive diamond nanocrystals. This work, based on diffractive elements
able to efficiently bend light at angles as large as 82{\deg}, represents a
step beyond traditional optical elements and existing flat optics,
circumventing the efficiency drop associated to the standard, phase mapping
approach.

JCMT maps of HCO+ and DCO+ with non-LTE (RADEX) models in a region that
spatially covers the outflow activity of IRAS 4A. To study the envelope
chemistry, we derive empirical molecular abundance profiles for the observed
species using the radiative transfer code (RATRAN) and adopting a 1D dust
density/temperature profile from the literature. We compare our best-fit
observed abundance profiles with the predictions from the time dependent gas
grain chemical code (ALCHEMIC). The CO, HCN, HNC and CN abundance require an
enhanced UV field which points towards an outflow cavity. The abundances (wrt
H2) are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those observed in the high mass
protostellar envelope (AFGL 2591), while they are found to be similar within
factors of a few with respect to CO. Differences in UV radiation may be
responsible for such chemical differentiation, but temperature differences seem
a more plausible explanation. The CH3OH modeled abundance profile points
towards an age of > 4x10^4 yrs for IRAS 4A. The spatial distribution of H2D+
differs from that of other deuterated species, indicating an origin from a
foreground colder layer (<20 K). The observed abundances can be explained by
passive heating towards the high mass protostellar envelope, while the presence
of UV cavity channels become more important toward the low mass protostellar
envelope.

is governed by nucleation and growth. The experiments reveal a dependence of
the hole density on film thickness and temperature. The combination of lowered

polymer films, a critical nucleus size is inferred from a free energy model.
This critical nucleus size is supported by the film breakup observed in the

higher fields, that is $\Theta_H \sim 82.5^{\circ}$, implying a very pronounced
Hall signal superimposed into its magnetoresistivity. For magnetic fields and
electrical currents perpendicular to the \emph{c}-axis we observe a very
pronounced planar Hall-effect, when the magnetic field is rotated within the
basal plane. This effect is observed even at higher temperatures, i.e. as high
as $T = 100$ K, and predicted recently to result from the chiral anomaly among
Weyl points. Superimposed onto this planar Hall, which is an even function of
the field, we observe an anomalous planar Hall-signal akin to the one reported
for that is an odd function of the field. Below 100 K, negative longitudinal
magnetoresistivity (LMR), initially ascribed to the chiral anomaly and
subsequently to current inhomogeneities, is observed in samples having
different geometries and contact configurations, once the large Hall signal is
subtracted. Our measurements reveal a phase transition upon approaching the
quantum limit that leads to the reconstruction of the FS and to the concomitant
suppression of the negative LMR indicating that it is intrinsically associated
with the Weyl dispersion at the Fermi level. For fields along the \emph{a}-axis
it also leads to a pronounced hysteresis pointing to a field-induced electronic
phase-transition. This collection of unconventional tranport observations

circles can be packed into a given container. Packing problems like this have
been shown to be $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. In this paper, we present new sufficient
conditions for packing circles into square and triangular containers, using
only the sum of the circles' areas: For square containers, it is possible to
pack any set of circles with a combined area of up to approximately 53.90% of
the square's area. And when the container is a right or obtuse triangle, any
set of circles whose combined area does not exceed the triangle's incircle can
be packed.
  These area conditions are tight, in the sense that for any larger areas,
there are sets of circles which cannot be packed. Similar results have long
been known for squares, but to the best of our knowledge, we give the first
results of this type for circular objects.
  Our proofs are constructive: We describe a versatile,
divide-and-conquer-based algorithm for packing circles into various container
shapes with optimal worst-case density. It employs an elegant subdivision
scheme that recursively splits the circles into two groups and then packs these
into subcontainers. We call this algorithm ""Split Packing"". It can be used as a
constant-factor approximation algorithm when looking for the smallest container
in which a given set of circles can be packed, due to its polynomial runtime.

namely domain critic and multi-modal critic. The domain critic assesses whether
the generated sentences are indistinguishable from sentences in the target

adversaries -- captioner aims to generate indistinguishable sentences, whereas
critics aim at distinguishing them. The assessment improves the captioner
through policy gradient updates. During inference, we further propose a novel
critic-based planning method to select high-quality sentences without
additional supervision (e.g., tags). To evaluate, we use MSCOCO as the source

techniques to descriptor systems, without any modifications, may lead to poor
reduced-order systems. Therefore, for the analysis, we aim at transforming the
considered QB descriptor system into an equivalent QBODE system by means of
projectors for which standard model reduction techniques for QBODEs can be
employed, including aforementioned interpolation scheme. Subsequently, we
discuss related computational issues, thus resulting in a modified algorithm

explicitly computing the projectors used in the analysis. The efficiency of the

However, available inkjet printable formulations are still far from ideal as
they are either based on toxic solvents, have low concentration, or require
time-consuming and expensive formulation processing. In addition, none of those
formulations are suitable for thin-film heterostructure fabrication due to the
re-mixing of different 2D crystals, giving rise to uncontrolled interfaces,
which results in poor device performance and lack of reproducibility. In this
work we show a general formulation engineering approach to achieve highly

also provides optimal film formation for multi-stack fabrication. We show
examples of all-inkjet printed heterostructures, such as large area arrays of

Yet it is an essential parameter of reionization models. We study in detail how
ionizing radiation can leak from high redshift galaxies. For this purpose, we
use a series of high resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations, zooming on
three dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context. We find that the energy and
momentum input from the supernova explosions has a pivotal role in regulating
the escape fraction, by disrupting dense star forming clumps, and clearing
sight lines in the halo. In the absence of supernovae, photons are absorbed
very locally, within the birth clouds of massive stars. We follow the time
evolution of the escape fraction, and find that it can vary by more than six
orders of magnitude. This explains the large scatter in the value of the escape
fraction found by previous studies. This fast variability also impacts the
observability of the sources of reionization: a survey even as deep as $M_{\rm

  relationships affect population differentiation in sexual trait?",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Divergence between populations for a given trait can be driven by natural or
sexual selection, interacting with migration behaviour. Mating preference for
different phenotypes can lead to the emergence and persistence of
differentiated populations. Dominance between alleles encoding for divergent
phenotypes can interfere in such processes. Using a diploid model of trait
determining both mating success and migration rate, we explored differentiation
between two connected populations, assuming either co-dominance or strict
dominance between alleles. The model assumes that individuals prefer mating
with partners displaying the same phenotype and therefore tend to move to the
other population when their own phenotype is rare. We show that the emergence
of differentiated populations in this diploid model is limited as compared to
results obtained with the same model assuming haploidy. When assuming
co-dominance, differentiation arises only when migration is limited as compared
to preference. Such differentiation is less dependent on migration when
assuming strict dominance between haplotypes. Dominant alleles frequently
invade populations because their phenotype is more frequently expressed,
resulting in higher mating success and rapid decrease in migration. However,
depending on the initial distribution of alleles, this advantage associated
with dominance (i.e. Haldane's sieve) may lead to fixation of the dominant
allele throughout both populations. Depending on the initial distribution of
heterozygotes, persistence of polymorphisms within populations can also occur
because heterozygotes displaying the predominant phenotype benefit from mating
preferences. Altogether, our results highlight that heterozygotes' behaviour
has a strong impact on population differentiation and stress out the need of
diploid models of differentiation and speciation driven by natural and sexual
selection.

PWNe with the interstellar medium (ISM). Some of the PWNe are moving relative
to the ISM with supersonic speeds producing bow shocks. In this case, the
ultrarelativistic particles accelerated at the termination surface of the
pulsar wind may be reaccelerated in the converging flow system formed by the
outflow from the wind termination shock and the inflow from the bow shock. An
outcome of this reacceleration is the creation of particle distributions with
hard spectra, such as required to explain the observed synchrotron spectra with
photon indices Gamma <~ 1.5. The presence of this hard component is specific to
PWNe with bow shocks (BSPWNe). The accelerated particles may end up containing
a substantial fraction of the shock ram pressure. For typical ISM and pulsar
parameters, the positrons released by these systems are numerous enough to
contribute a substantial fraction of the positrons detected as galactic cosmic
ray particles above few tens and up to several hundred GeV. The escape of
ultrarelativistic particles from a BSPWN and its appearance in the far-UV and
X-ray bands is determined by the directions of the interstellar magnetic field,
the velocity of the astrosphere and the pulsar rotation axis. In this respect
we review the observed appearance and multiwavelength spectra of three
different types of BSPWNe: PSR J0437-4715, the Guitar and Lighthouse nebulae,

Navier-Stokes equations from kinetic theory, using a method that affords a step
by step insight into the required simplifying assumptions. The major task on
this way is to find the conditions needed to truncate the resulting infinite
system of transport equations at a finite level. The minimal obtainable closed
set comprises three equations, for the particle number density $\mathit{N} $,
the macroscopic velocity $\mathbf{v}$, and the temperature $\mathit{T}$. It is
verified that this 3-equation system conserves the total energy, i.e., the sum
of kinetic and internal energy. As a consequence, the energy is not conserved
if the integrity of this closed system is violated, as for instance in the case
of the so-called incompressible Navier-Stokes equations where the equation for
$\mathbf{v}$ is the only one kept, and the other two discarded and jointly
replaced by the incompressibility condition $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$. It
is shown that a second viscosity, found in parts of the literature, does not
exist as long as the Navier-Stokes equation is applied inside the range of its
validity. Outside this range, a second viscosity builds up, however not as a
matter constant. The Navier-Stokes equation in its known form rests upon the
tacit assumption that the particles are points without volume and without

their derived effective temperatures (Teff), surface gravities (log g) and
metallicities ([Fe/H]) possibly combined with photometric, astrometric,

of pre-helium-core burning, helium-core burning and post helium-core burning
solutions as well as different peaks in multi-modal PDFs (i.e. each unimodal
sub-PDF) of the different evolutionary phases separately. For over 2.5 million

unimodal sub-PDF. We report Gaussian, skewed Gaussian, truncated Gaussian,
modified truncated exponential distribution or truncated Student's
t-distribution functions to represent each sub-PDF, allowing to reconstruct

  Context-free languages (CFL) are another major family well-suited to
formalize programming, natural, and many other classes of languages; their
increased generative power w.r.t. RL, however, causes the loss of several
closure properties and of the decidability of important problems; furthermore
they need complex parsing algorithms. Thus, various subclasses thereof have
been defined with different goals, spanning from efficient, deterministic

typical tree-structure is visible in the sentences, exhibit many of the

bolometric luminosity ($\sim10^{11}$L$_\odot$). As most of the galaxy's energy
output comes from this small region, it is of interest to determine what fuels
this intense activity. An interaction with VV 655 has been proposed, where gas
aquired by NGC 4418 could trigger intense star formation and/or black hole
accretion in the centre. We aim to constrain the interaction hypothesis by
studying neutral hydrogen structures around the two galaxies. We present
observations at 1.4 GHz with the Very Large Array of radio continuum as well as
emission and absorption from atomic hydrogen. Gaussian distributions are fitted
to observed HI emission and absorption spectra. An atomic HI bridge is seen in
emission, connecting NGC 4418 to VV 655. While NGC 4418 is bright in continuum
emission and seen in HI absorption, VV 655 is barely detected in the continuum
but show bright HI emission (M$_\mathrm{HI}\sim10^9$ M$_\odot$). We estimate
SFRs from 1.4 GHz of 3.2 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and 0.13 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for
NGC 4418 and VV 655 respectively. Systemic HI velocities of 2202$\pm$20 km
s$^{-1}$ (emission) and 2105.4$\pm$10 km s$^{-1}$ (absorption) are measured for
VV 655 and NGC 4418 respectively. Redshifted HI absorption is seen towards NGC
4418, suggesting gas infall. Blueshifted HI-emission is seen north-west of NGC
4418, which we interpret as a continuation of the outflow previously discussed
by Sakamoto et al. (2013). The morphology and velocity structure seen in HI is
consistent with an interaction scenario, where gas was transferred from VV 655
to NGC 4418, and may fuel the activity in the centre.

class of recently proposed weighting methods which find the weights of minimum
dispersion that approximately balance the covariates. We call these weights
""minimal weights"" and study them under a common optimization framework. The key
observation is the connection between approximate covariate balance and
shrinkage estimation of the propensity score. This connection leads to both
theoretical and practical developments. From a theoretical standpoint, we
characterize the asymptotic properties of minimal weights and show that, under
standard smoothness conditions on the propensity score function, minimal
weights are consistent estimates of the true inverse probability weights. Also,
we show that the resulting weighting estimator is consistent, asymptotically
normal, and semiparametrically efficient. From a practical standpoint, we
present a finite sample oracle inequality that bounds the loss incurred by
balancing more functions of the covariates than strictly needed. This
inequality shows that minimal weights implicitly bound the number of active
covariate balance constraints. We finally provide a tuning algorithm for
choosing the degree of approximate balance in minimal weights. We conclude the
paper with four empirical studies that suggest approximate balance is
preferable to exact balance, especially when there is limited overlap in
covariate distributions. In these studies, we show that the root mean squared
error of the weighting estimator can be reduced by as much as a half with
approximate balance.

reduced complexity. The effectiveness of the robust beam alignment procedure,
compared with classical designs, is then verified on simulation settings with

slow paramagnetic spin dynamics has been evidenced from neutron backscattering
and muon spin relaxation (muSR). In the case of muSR this has been revealed
through the strong effect of a 50 mT longitudinal field on the spin-lattice
relaxation rate. Here, motivated by a recent successful work performed for
Yb2Ti2O7 and Yb2Sn2O7, analyzing the shape of the muSR longitudinal
polarization function, we substantiate the existence of extremely slow
paramagnetic spin dynamics in the microsecond time range for Nd2Sn2O7. Between
1.7 and 7 K, this time scale is temperature independent. This suggests a double
spin-flip tunneling relaxation mechanism to be at play, probably involving spin
substructures such as tetrahedra. Unexpectedly, the standard deviation of the
field distribution at the muon site increases as the system is cooled. This
exotic spin dynamics is in sharp contrast with the dynamics above 100 K which
is driven by the Orbach relaxation mechanism involving single Nd3+ magnetic
moments.

contact discontinuity (CD) is a special point in the flow - density, kinetic
pressure and magnetic field experience a jump or are non-analytic on the CD. To
connect dynamically the outside region (the forward shock flow) with the inside
region (the reverse shock flow) requires resolving flow singularities at the
contact discontinuity. On the CD the pressure is communicated exclusively by
the magnetic field on both sides - the CD becomes an Alfven tangential
discontinuity. Thus, the dynamic amplification of the magnetic field leads to a
formation of a narrow magnetosheath. We discussed a possibility that particles
emitting early $X$-ray afterglows, as well as Fermi GeV photons, are
accelerated via magnetic reconnection processes in the post-reverse shock

has a high potential for future applications in pathology. Due to the
complexity and size of the data, automated feature extraction and
classification steps are required to fully process the data. Deep learning
offers an approach to learn feature extraction and classification combined in a
single model. Commonly these steps are handled separately in IMS data analysis,
hence deep learning offers an alternative strategy worthwhile to explore.
Results: Methodologically, we propose an adapted architecture based on deep
convolutional networks to handle the characteristics of mass spectrometry data,
as well as a strategy to interpret the learned model in the spectral domain
based on a sensitivity analysis. The proposed methods are evaluated on two
challenging tumor classification tasks and compared to a baseline approach.
Competitiveness of the proposed methods are shown on both tasks by studying the
performance via cross-validation. Moreover, the learned models are analyzed by
the proposed sensitivity analysis revealing biologically plausible effects as
well as confounding factors of the considered task. Thus, this study may serve
as a starting point for further development of deep learning approaches in IMS
classification tasks.

high-dimensional models where the number of variables may far exceed the number
of observations. Existing literature has considered less than a handful of
hypotheses, such as testing individual coordinates of the model parameter.
However, the problem of testing general and complex hypotheses remains widely
open. We propose a new inference method developed around the hypothesis
adaptive projection pursuit framework, which solves the testing problems in the
most general case. The proposed inference is centered around a new class of
estimators defined as $l_1$ projection of the initial guess of the unknown onto
the space defined by the null. This projection automatically takes into account
the structure of the null hypothesis and allows us to study formal inference
for a number of long-standing problems. For example, we can directly conduct
inference on the sparsity level of the model parameters and the minimum signal
strength. This is especially significant given the fact that the former is a
fundamental condition underlying most of the theoretical development in
high-dimensional statistics, while the latter is a key condition used to
establish variable selection properties. Moreover, the proposed method is
asymptotically exact and has satisfactory power properties for testing very
general functionals of the high-dimensional parameters. The simulation studies
lend further support to our theoretical claims and additionally show excellent
finite-sample size and power properties of the proposed test.

shape long-range interaction. Interactions between atoms of the second species
and between the two species are characterized by local inter- and intra-species

interspecies onsite interactions can stabilize a pronounced region of
supersolid phases. This is characterized by two distinctive types of
supersolids, where the bare species forms supersolid phases that are immersed
in strongly correlated quantum phases, i.e. a crystalline solid or supersolid
of the dressed atoms. We show that the interspecies interaction leads to a
roton-like instability in the bare species and therefore is crucially important
to the supersolid formation. We provide a detailed calculation of the
interaction potential to show how our results can be explored under current

internal dynamics and closed-loop control on the small-signal impedance of the

of their ""underlying inherent states"" --- the glassy configurations at zero
temperature obtained by an infinitely-fast (instantaneous) quench from
equilibrium supercooled states. Similar protocols are also regularly employed
in investigations of the unjamming transition at which the rigidity of
decompressed soft-sphere packings is lost. Here we investigate the statistics
and localization properties of low-frequency vibrational modes of glassy
configurations obtained by such instantaneous quenches. We show that the
density of vibrational modes grows as $\omega^\beta$ with $\beta$ depending on
the parent temperature $T_{0}$ from which the glassy configurations were
instantaneously quenched. For quenches from high temperature liquid states we
find $\beta\!\approx\!3$, whereas $\beta$ appears to approach the
previously-observed value $\beta\!=\!4$ as $T_0$ approaches the glass
transition temperature. We discuss the consistency of our findings with the
theoretical framework of the Soft Potential Model, and contrast them with
similar measurements performed on configurations obtained by continuous
quenches at finite cooling rates. Our results suggest that any physical quench
at rates sufficiently slower than the inverse vibrational timescale ---
including all physically-realistic quenching rates of molecular or atomistic
glasses --- would result in a glass whose density of vibrational modes is
universally characterized by $\beta\!=\!4$.

configuration, which are promising candidates for spin-based memory. MS
contains alluring features including remarkably high stability, ultra low

lower drive current requirement for movement, skyrmions have great potential in
energy efficient spintronic device applications. We propose a skyrmion-based
cache memory where data can be stored in a long nanotrack as multiple bits.
Write operation (formation of skyrmion) can be achieved by injecting spin
polarized current in a magnetic nanotrack and subsequently shifting the MS in
either direction along the nanotrack using charge current through a spin-Hall
metal (SHM), underneath the magnetic layer. The presence of skyrmion can alter
the resistance of a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) at the read port.
Considering the read and write latency along the long nanotrack cache memory, a
strategy of multiple read and write operations is discussed. Besides, the size
of a skyrmion affects the packing density, current induced motion velocity, and
readability (change of resistance while sensing the existence of a skyrmion).
Design optimization to mitigate the above effects is also investigated.

graphene, a coplanar waveguide (CPW) test structure was designed, fabricated
and tested in the frequency range from 1 GHz to 20 GHz. Antenna and CPW were
screen-printed on Kapton substrates using a graphene paste formulated with a
graphene to binder ratio of 1:2. A combination of thermal treatment and
subsequent compression rolling is utilized to further decrease the sheet
resistance for printed graphene structures, ultimately reaching 4 Ohm/sq. at 10
{\mu}m thicknesses. For the graphene-flakes printed antenna an antenna
efficiency of 60% is obtained. The measured maximum antenna gain is 2.3 dBi at
4.8 GHz. Thus the graphene-flakes printed antenna adds a total loss of only 3.1
dB to an RF link when compared to the same structure screen-printed for
reference with a commercial silver ink. This shows that the electrical
performance of screen-printed graphene flakes, which also does not degrade

the universe evolution without singularity like a Big Bang or a Big Rip. This
challenging subject stimulates one to regard a nonsingular universe in the far
past with an arbitrarily large vacuum energy. Considering the high energy
regime in the cosmic history, it is believed that Einstein gravity should be
corrected to an effective energy dependent theory which could be acquired by
gravity's rainbow. On the other hand, employing massive gravity provided us
with solutions to some of the long standing fundamental problems of cosmology
such as cosmological constant problem and self acceleration of the universe.
Considering these aspects of gravity's rainbow and massive gravity, in this
paper, we initiate studying FRW cosmology in the massive gravity's rainbow
formalism. At first, we show that although massive gravity modifies the FRW
cosmology, but it does not itself remove the big bang singularity. Then, we
generalize the massive gravity to the case of energy dependent spacetime and
find that massive gravity's rainbow can remove the early universe singularity.
We bring together all the essential conditions for having a nonsingular

generalizations on such criteria are determined.

closest known pulsar to the centre of any globular cluster. We present more
than 25 years of high-precision timing observations of this millisecond pulsar
and obtain four rotational frequency time derivative measurements. Modelling
these higher-order derivatives as being due to orbital motion, we find
solutions which indicate that the pulsar is in either a low-eccentricity
($0.33\lesssim e\lesssim0.4$) smaller orbit with a low mass companion (such as
a main sequence star, white dwarf, neutron star, or stellar mass black hole) or
a high-eccentricity ($e\gtrsim0.9$) larger orbit with a massive companion. The
cluster mass properties and the observed properties of 4U 1820$-$30 and the
other pulsars in the cluster argue against the low-eccentricity possibility.
The high-eccentricity solution reveals that the pulsar is most likely orbiting
around an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of mass $> 7,500$~M$_\odot$
located at the cluster centre. A gravitational model for the globular cluster,
which includes such a central black hole (BH), predicts an acceleration that is
commensurate with that measured for the pulsar. It further predicts that the
model-dependent minimum mass of the IMBH is $\sim60,000$~M$_\odot$. Accounting
for the associated contribution to the observed period derivative indicates
that the $\gamma$-ray efficiency of the pulsar should be between 0.08 and 0.2.
Our results suggest that other globular clusters may also contain central black
holes and they may be revealed by the study of new pulsars found sufficiently
close to their centres.
  Note that we found an erratum in Section 5 and thus, the
$\sim$60,000~M$_\odot$ mass mentioned above has to be replaced by the correct
model-dependent mass limit of $\sim$20,000~M$_\odot$. See the erratum appended.

which describe the periodic orbit repeating itself sinuously with a period that
exceeds $2\pi$. We find relativistic corrections to amplitudes of oscillating
modes as well as shifts of eigenfrequencies which depend on amplitudes. Besides
we find the relativistic contributions to modular angles. In the low-energy

oscillation and in-plane motion consisting of two circular modes. We compare
the results with the model of relativistic frequency-shifts developed by J.

  connectivity from the EEG",,,,,"cs.CE q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: The coupling between neuronal populations and its magnitude have
been shown to be informative for various clinical applications. One method to
estimate brain connectivity is with electroencephalography (EEG) from which the
cross-spectrum between different sensor locations is derived. We wish to test
the efficacy of tensor factorisation in the estimation of brain connectivity.
Methods: Complex tensor factorisation based on PARAFAC2 is used to decompose
the EEG into scalp components described by the spatial, spectral, and complex
trial profiles. An EEG model in the complex domain was derived that shows the
suitability of PARAFAC2. A connectivity metric was also derived on the complex
trial profiles of the extracted components. Results: Results on a benchmark EEG
dataset confirmed that PARAFAC2 can estimate connectivity better than
traditional tensor analysis such as PARAFAC within a range of signal-to-noise
ratios. The analysis of EEG from patients with mild cognitive impairment or
Alzheimer's disease showed that PARAFAC2 identifies loss of brain connectivity
better than traditional approaches and agreeing with prior pathological
knowledge. Conclusion: The complex PARAFAC2 algorithm is suitable for EEG
connectivity estimation since it allows to extract meaningful coupled sources
and provides better estimates than complex PARAFAC. Significance: A new
paradigm that employs complex tensor factorisation has demonstrated to be
successful in identifying brain connectivity and the location of couples
sources for both a benchmark and a real-world EEG dataset. This can enable
future applications and has the potential to solve some the issues that
deteriorate the performance of traditional connectivity metrics.

  regularized determinants and Riemann zeros",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emil Artin defined a zeta function for algebraic curves over finite fields
and made a conjecture about them analogous to the famous Riemann hypothesis.
This and other conjectures about these zeta functions would come to be called
the Weil conjectures, which were proved by Weil for curves and later, by
Deligne for varieties over finite fields. Much work was done in the search for
a proof of these conjectures, including the development in algebraic geometry
of a Weil cohomology theory for these varieties, which uses the Frobenius
operator on a finite field. The zeta function is then expressed as a
determinant, allowing the properties of the function to relate to those of the
operator. The search for a suitable cohomology theory and associated operator
to prove the Riemann hypothesis is still on. In this paper, we study the
properties of the derivative operator $D = \frac{d}{dz}$ on a particular
weighted Bergman space of entire functions. The operator $D$ can be naturally
viewed as the `infinitesimal shift of the complex plane'. Furthermore, this
operator is meant to be the replacement for the Frobenius operator in the
general case and is used to construct an operator associated to any suitable
meromorphic function. We then show that the meromorphic function can be
recovered by using a regularized determinant involving the above operator. This
is illustrated in some important special cases: rational functions, zeta
functions of curves over finite fields, the Riemann zeta function, and
culminating in a quantized version of the Hadamard factorization theorem that
applies to any entire function of finite order. Our construction is motivated
in part by [23] on the infinitesimal shift of the real line, as well as by
earlier work of Deninger [10] on cohomology in number theory and a conjectural
`fractal cohomology theory' envisioned in [25] and [28].
