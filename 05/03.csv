been developed for estimating and bounding the information rate. In this paper

traditional entity linking because we are working in a limited domain, namely,
people entities, and we are including pronouns as entities, whereas in the
past, pronouns were never considered as entities in entity linking. We have
built 2 models, both outperforms our baseline model significantly. The purpose
of our project is to build a model that could be use to generate cleaner data

However, the interpretation of these observations is complex. One must consider
the various effects that alter the measured polarized signal, such as the shape
of dust grains, the efficiency of grain alignment, the magnetic field
properties, and the projection of the signal along the line of sight. We aim at
analyzing observations of the polarized dust emission by disentangling the
effects on the polarization signal in the context of 3D radiative transfer
simulations. For this purpose, we developed a code capable of simulating dust
grain alignment of aspherical grains and intrinsical polarization of thermal
dust emission. We find that the influence of thermal polarization and dust
grain alignment on the polarized emission displayed as spatially resolved
polarization map or as spectral energy distribution trace disk properties which
are not traced in total (unpolarized) emission such as the magnetic field
topology. The radiative transfer simulations presented in this work enable the
3D analysis of intrinsically polarized dust emission - observed with, e.g.,
ALMA - which is essential to constrain magnetic field properties.

Current technologies do not make it easy to do so, typically because they
separate data collection (e.g., packet capture or flow monitoring) from
analysis, producing either too much data to answer a general question or too
little data to answer a detailed question. In this paper, we present Sonata, a
network telemetry system that uses a uniform query interface to drive the joint
collection and analysis of network traffic. Sonata takes the advantage of two
emerging technologies---streaming analytics platforms and programmable network
devices---to facilitate joint collection and analysis. Sonata allows operators
to more directly express network traffic analysis tasks in terms of a
high-level language. The underlying runtime partitions each query into a
portion that runs on the switch and another that runs on the streaming
analytics platform iteratively refines the query to efficiently capture only
the traffic that pertains to the operator's query, and exploits sketches to
reduce state in switches in exchange for more approximate results. Through an
evaluation of a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that Sonata can
support a wide range of network telemetry tasks with less state in the network,
and lower data rates to streaming analytics systems, than current approaches
can achieve.

configurations and antiparallel magnetic fields. In view of this, we analyzed
the kinetic turbulence self-generated by three-dimensional guide-field
reconnection through force-free current sheets in frequency and wavenumber
spaces, utilizing 3D particle-in-cell code numerical simulations. Our
investigations reveal reconnection rates and kinetic turbulence with features
similar to those obtained by current in-situ spacecraft observations of MMS as
well as in the laboratory reconnection experiments MRX, VTF and
\textsc{Vineta}-II. In particular we found that the kinetic turbulence
developing in the course of 3D guide-field reconnection exhibits a broadband
power-law spectrum extending beyond the lower-hybrid frequency and up to the
electron frequencies. In the frequency space the spectral index of the
turbulence appeared to be close to -2.8 at the reconnection X-line. In the
wavenumber space it also becomes -2.8 as soon as the normalized reconnection
rate reaches 0.1. The broadband kinetic turbulence is mainly due to
current-streaming and electron-flow-shear instabilities excited in the
sufficiently thin current sheets of kinetic reconnection. The growth of the
kinetic turbulence corresponds to high reconnection rates which exceed those of
fast laminar, non-turbulent reconnection.

time interval to the number of users is reasonably high, it is beneficial not
to fully reuse pilots from interfering cells. This work finds the optimum pilot
assignment strategy that would maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) given the
user groups with different priorities. A closed-form solution for the optimal
pilot assignment is derived and is shown to make intuitive sense. Performance
comparison shows that under wide range of channel conditions, the optimal pilot
assignment that uses extra set of pilots achieves better WSR performance than
conventional full pilot reuse.

filamentation of electric and magnetic fields caused by streaming

filamentation leads to additional curvature-driven electron acceleration in the

randomness brings to uncertain communication. Can Alice and Bob achieve
efficient communication amid uncertainty without using public randomness? How
powerful are public-coin protocols in overcoming uncertainty? Motivated by
these two questions:
  - We prove the first separation between private-coin uncertain communication

the communication in the standard model and the public-coin uncertain
communication are $O(1)$ while the private-coin uncertain communication is a
growing function of the length $n$ of the inputs.

communication. We exhibit a function class and a distribution (with $I \approx
n$) for which the one-way certain communication is $k$ bits but the one-way

multigraded right modules over the free associative algebra. In particular, we
compute such series for noncommutative multigraded algebras. Using results from
the theory of regular languages, we provide conditions when the methods are
effective and hence the sum of the Hilbert series is a rational function.
Moreover, a characterization of finite-dimensional algebras is obtained in
terms of the nilpotency of a key matrix involved in the computations. Using
this result, efficient variants of the methods are also developed for the
computation of Hilbert series of truncated infinite-dimensional algebras whose
(non-truncated) Hilbert series may not be rational functions. We consider some
applications of the computation of multigraded Hilbert series to algebras that
are invariant under the action of the general linear group. In fact, in this
case such series are symmetric functions which can be decomposed in terms of
Schur functions. Finally, we present an efficient and complete implementation
of (standard) graded and multigraded Hilbert series that has been developed in
the kernel of the computer algebra system Singular. A large set of tests
provides a comprehensive experimentation for the proposed algorithms and their
implementations.

(small-volume) N-body simulations, which is why the response contributions to
the covariance remain valid and predictive at all orders in perturbation
theory. A novel and key step presented here is the use of responses to compute
loop contributions with soft loop momenta, which extends the application of the
response approach beyond that of previously considered squeezed $n$-point

the softer mode is sufficiently linear, ${\rm min}\{k_1,k_2\} \lesssim 0.08\

corner-sharing tetrahedra. Here we report on an unusual magnetic phenomenon,
namely a cooling-field induced shift of magnetic hysteresis loop along
magnetization axis, and its possible origin in pyrochlore iridates with
non-magnetic Ir defects (e.g. Ir3+). In a simple model, we attribute the
magnetic hysteresis loop to the formation of ferromagnetic droplets in the AIAO
antiferromagnetic background. The weak ferromagnetism originates from canted
antiferromagnetic order of the Ir4+ moments surrounding each non-magnetic Ir
defect. The shift of hysteresis loop can be understood quantitatively based on
an exchange-bias like effect in which the moments at the shell of the FM
droplets are pinned by the AIAO AFM background via mainly the Heisenberg (J)
and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (D) interactions. The magnetic pinning is stable and
robust against the sweeping cycle and sweeping field up to 35 T, which is
possibly related to the magnetic octupolar nature of the AIAO order.

hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). Both events require a powerful central energy source, usually
attributed to a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black hole. The GRB-SLSN
link raises several theoretical questions: What distinguishes the engines
responsible for these different phenomena? Can a single engine power both a GRB
and a luminous SN in the same event? We propose a new unifying model for
magnetar thermalization and jet formation: misalignment between the rotation
(${\bf \Omega}$) and magnetic dipole (${\bf \mu}$) axes thermalizes a fraction
of the spindown power by reconnection in the striped equatorial wind, providing
a guaranteed source of ""thermal"" emission to power the supernova. The remaining
un-thermalized power energizes a relativistic jet. In this picture, the
GRB-SLSN dichotomy is directly linked to ${\bf \Omega \cdot \mu}$. We extend
earlier work to show that even weak relativistic jets of luminosity
$\sim10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can escape the expanding SN ejecta hours after the
explosion, implying that escaping relativistic jets may accompany many SLSNe.
We calculate the observational signature of these jets. We show that they may
produce transient UV cocoon emission lasting a few hours when the jet breaks
out of the ejecta surface. A longer-lived optical/UV signal may originate from
a mildly-relativistic wind driven from the interface between the jet and the
ejecta walls. This provides a new explanation for the secondary early-time
maximum observed in some SLSNe light curves, such as LSQ14bdq. This scenario
also predicts a population of GRB from on-axis jets with extremely long
durations, potentially similar to the population of ""jetted tidal disruption
events"", in coincidence with a small subset of SLSNe.

constraints from X-ray and radio observations of M87 with a shock model to
derive the properties of the outburst that created the 13 kpc shock. Principal
constraints for the model are 1) the measured Mach number ($M$$\sim$1.2), 2)
the radius of the 13 kpc shock, and 3) the observed size of the central

$\sim$22% of the energy is carried by the shock as it expands. The remaining
$\sim$80% of the outburst energy is available to heat the core gas. More than
half the total outburst energy initially goes into the enthalpy of the central
bubble, the radio cocoon. As the buoyant bubble rises, much of its energy is
transferred to the ambient thermal gas. For an outburst repetition rate of

suffer from p-wave suppression or helicity suppression, rendering them
subdominant to unsuppressed s-wave processes. We demonstrate that the natural
inclusion of dark initial state radiation can open an unsuppressed s-wave
annihilation channel, and thus provide the dominant dark matter annihilation
process for particular interaction types. We illustrate this effect with the
bremsstrahlung of a dark spin-0 or dark spin-1 particle from fermionic dark
matter, $\overline{\chi}\chi\rightarrow \overline{f}f\phi$ or
$\overline{f}fZ'$. The dark initial state radiation process, despite having a
3-body final state, proceeds at the same order in the new physics scale
$\Lambda$ as the annihilation to the 2-body final state
$\overline{\chi}\chi\rightarrow \overline{f}f$. This is lower order in
$\Lambda$ than the well-studied lifting of helicity suppression via Standard
Model final state radiation, or virtual internal bremsstrahlung. This dark
bremsstrahlung process should influence LHC and indirect detection searches for
dark matter.

The prevailing wisdom is that this can be explained by the existence of
two-state defects within the material. The so-called standard tunneling model
has become the established framework to explain these results, yet it still
leaves the central question essentially unanswered -- what are these two-level
defects? This question has recently taken on a new urgency with the rise of
superconducting circuits in quantum computing, circuit quantum electrodynamics,
magnetometry, electrometry and metrology. Superconducting circuits made from
aluminium or niobium are fundamentally limited by losses due to two-level
defects within the amorphous oxide layers encasing them. On the other hand,
these circuits also provide a novel and effective method for studying the very
defects which limit their operation. We can now go beyond ensemble measurements
and probe individual defects -- observing the quantum nature of their dynamics
and studying their formation, their behaviour as a function of applied field,
strain, temperature and other properties. This article reviews the plethora of
recent experimental results in this area and discusses the various theoretical
models which have been used to describe the observations. In doing so, it
summarises the current approaches to solving this fundamentally important
problem in solid-state physics.

The most important advantage of the MMCP is it's precision even when the amount

build a very complete sample with high purity. The success rate of uncovering
[Fe/H]SEGUE<-3.0 stars among [Fe/H]Pristine<-3.0 selected stars is 24% and 85%

nine local early-type galaxies based on their low mass X-ray binary (LMXB)
populations. Comprised of accreting black holes and neutron stars, these LMXBs
can be used to constrain the important high mass end of the IMF. We consider
the LMXB populations beyond the cores of the galaxies ($>0.2R_{e}$; covering
$75-90\%$ of their stellar light) and find no evidence for systematic
variations of the IMF with velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). We reject IMFs which
become increasingly bottom heavy with $\sigma$, up to steep power-laws
(exponent, $\alpha>2.8$) in massive galaxies ($\sigma>300$km/s), for
galactocentric radii $>1/4\ R_{e}$. Previously proposed IMFs that become
increasingly bottom heavy with $\sigma$ are consistent with these data if only
the number of low mass stars $(<0.5M_{\odot}$) varies. We note that our results
are consistent with some recent work which proposes that extreme IMFs are only
present in the central regions of these galaxies. We also consider IMFs that
become increasingly top-heavy with $\sigma$, resulting in significantly more
LMXBs. Such a model is consistent with these observations, but additional data
are required to significantly distinguish between this and an invariant IMF.
For six of these galaxies, we directly compare with published IMF mismatch
parameters from the Atlas3D survey, $\alpha_{dyn}$. We find good agreement with
the LMXB population if galaxies with higher $\alpha_{dyn}$ have more top-heavy
IMFs -- although we caution that our sample is quite small. Future LMXB
observations can provide further insights into the origin of $\alpha_{dyn}$
variations.

illustrate how the lattice response transitions from bulk-to-edge

fields. The polariton transport is affected by the polaritonic spin-orbit
interaction, which is caused by the splitting of transverse-electric and
transverse-magnetic (TE-TM) modes. This is the basis for a polaritonic Hall
effect, called optical spin Hall effect (OSHE), which is related to the
formation of spin/polarization textures in momentum space, determining
anisotropic ballistic transport, as well as related textures in real space.
Owing to Coulombic interactions between the excitonic components of the
polaritons, optical excitation of polaritons can affect the OSHE. We present a
theoretical analysis of the OSHE and its optical control in semiconductor
double microcavities, i.e. two optically coupled cavities, which are
particularly well suited for the creation of polaritonic reservoirs that affect
the spin-texture-forming polaritons. The theory is formulated in terms of a set
of double-cavity spinor-polariton Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Numerical
solutions feature, among other things, a controlled rotation of the spin
texture in momentum space. The theory also allows for an identification of the
effective magnetic field component that determines the optical control in
phenomenological pseudo-spin models in terms of exciton interactions and the
polariton density in the second lower polariton branch.

subject of increasing interest over the past decade. One of the most appealing
features of non-Markovianity (NM) is that it captures scenarios where loss of

information from the environment to the system is possible. In this work we
study the interplay between the degree of non-Markovianity and the action of
time-dependent control fields in an open two-level quantum system. We find that
periodical modulation of a field acting solely on the system can greatly
enhance the degree of non-Markovianity with respect to the undriven case. We
show that this effect is present only when the coupling between system and
environment is weak. Remarkably, the enhancement disappears at strong coupling,
which is usually the regime where non-Markovian effects are expected to be more
pronounced.

formidable computations are required to address theoretically their locomotion
in complex, nonlinear fluids, e.g.~mucus. Based on experimental measurements
for the motion of rigid rods in non-Newtonian fluids and on the classical
Carreau fluid model, we propose empirical extensions of the classical Newtonian
resistive-force theory to model the waving of slender filaments in
non-Newtonian fluids. By assuming the flow near the flagellum to be locally
Newtonian, we propose a self-consistent way to estimate the typical shear-rate
in the fluid, which we then use to construct correction factors to the
Newtonian local drag coefficients. The resulting non-Newtonian resistive-force
theory, while empirical, is consistent with the Newtonian limit, and with the
experiments. We then use our models to address waving locomotion in
non-Newtonian fluids, and show that the resulting swimming speeds are
systematically lowered -- a result which we are able to capture asymptotically

experimental results on the locomotion of Caenorhabditis elegans in polymeric

field lines. We developed a simple radiative transfer model to simulate
magnetar flare emission in the case of a steady trapped fireball. After
dividing the fireball surface in a number of plane-parallel slabs, the local
spectral and polarization properties are obtained integrating the radiative
transfer equations for the two normal modes. We assume that magnetic Thomson
scattering is the dominant source of opacity, and neglect contributions from
second-order radiative processes, although double-Compton scattering is
accounted for in establishing local thermal equilibrium in the fireball
atmospheric layers. The observed spectral and polarization properties as
measured by a distant observer are obtained summing the contributions from the
patches which are visible for a given viewing geometry by means of a
ray-tracing code. The spectra we obtained in the 1-100 keV energy range are

and thus trace AGN activity within star-forming and quiescent galaxies, as a
function of stellar mass (from $10^{8.5}-10^{11.5} M_\odot$) and redshift (to
$z \sim 4$). We adopt near-infrared selected samples of galaxies from the
CANDELS and UltraVISTA surveys, extract X-ray data for every galaxy, and use a
flexible Bayesian method to combine these data and to measure the probability
distribution function of specific black hole accretion rates,
$\lambda_{sBHAR}$. We identify a broad distribution of $\lambda_{sBHAR}$ in
both star-forming and quiescent galaxies---likely reflecting the stochastic
nature of AGN fuelling---with a roughly power-law shape that rises toward lower
$\lambda_{sBHAR}$, a steep cutoff at $\lambda_{sBHAR} \gtrsim 0.1-1$ (in
Eddington equivalent units), and a turnover or flattening at $\lambda_{sBHAR}
\lesssim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. We find that the probability of a star-forming
galaxy hosting a moderate $\lambda_{sBHAR}$ AGN depends on stellar mass and
evolves with redshift, shifting toward higher $\lambda_{sBHAR}$ at higher
redshifts. This evolution is truncated at a point corresponding to the
Eddington limit, indicating black holes may self-regulate their growth at high
redshifts when copious gas is available. The probability of a quiescent galaxy
hosting an AGN is generally lower than that of a star-forming galaxy, shows
signs of suppression at the highest stellar masses, and evolves strongly with
redshift. The AGN duty cycle in high-redshift ($z\gtrsim2$) quiescent galaxies
thus reaches $\sim$20 per cent, comparable to the duty cycle in star-forming
galaxies of equivalent stellar mass and redshift.

accretion-rate distribution is defined as the probability of a galaxy with a
given stellar mass and redshift hosting an active nucleus with a certain
specific accretion rate. We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting an
AGN increases with decreasing specific accretion rate. There is evidence that
this trend reverses at low specific accretion rates, $\lambda<10^{-4}-10^{-3}$
(in Eddington units). There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above
which the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply. The specific
accretion-rate distribution evolves such that the fraction of AGN among
galaxies drops toward lower redshifts. This decrease in the AGN duty cycle is
responsible for the strong evolution of the accretion density of the Universe
from redshift $z\approx1-1.5$ to the present day. Our analysis also suggests
that this evolution is accompanied by a decoupling of accretion events onto
black holes from the formation of stars in galaxies. There is also evidence
that at earlier times the relative probability of high vs low specific
accretion-rate events among galaxies increases. We argue that this differential
redshift evolution of the AGN duty cycle with respect to $\lambda$ produces the
AGN downsizing trend, whereby luminous sources peak at earlier epochs compared
to less luminous ones. Finally, we also find a stellar-mass dependence of the
specific accretion-rate distribution, with more massive galaxies avoiding high
specific accretion-rate events.

limits on WIMPs from direct and indirect detection experiments. We plot the

rate or secondary infection risk, is the probability of infectious contact from
an infectious household member A to a given household member B, where we define
infectious contact to be a contact sufficient to infect B if he or she is
susceptible. Estimation of the SAR is an important part of understanding and
controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. In practice, it is most
often estimated using binomial models such as logistic regression, which
implicitly attribute all secondary infections in a household to the primary
case. In the simplest case, the number of secondary infections in a household
with m susceptibles and a single primary case is modeled as a binomial(m, p)
random variable where p is the SAR. Although it has long been understood that
transmission within households is not binomial, it is thought that multiple
generations of transmission can be safely neglected when p is small. We use
probability generating functions and simulations to show that this is a
mistake. The proportion of susceptible household members infected can be
substantially larger than the SAR even when p is small. As a result, binomial
estimates of the SAR are biased upward and their confidence intervals have poor
coverage probabilities even if adjusted for clustering. Accurate point and
interval estimates of the SAR can be obtained using longitudinal chain binomial
models or pairwise survival analysis, which account for multiple generations of
transmission within households, the ongoing risk of infection from outside the

the convolutional neural network (CNN). To make the behavioral data appropriate
for the spatial learning in CNN, several reduction steps are taken to form the
topical metrics and place them homogeneously like pixels in the images. The
experimental result shows both the temporal- and the spatial- gains when
compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. A new learning framework
called spatially connected convolutional networks (SCCN) is introduced to more
efficiently predict the behavior.

sequence of random pairwise interactions of $n$ agents (nodes). We show
population protocols for two problems: the leader election and the exact
majority voting. The leader election starts with all agents in the same initial
state and the goal is to converge to the (global) state when exactly one agent
is in a distinct state $L$. The exact majority voting starts with each agent in
one of the two distinct states $A$ or $B$ and the goal is to make all nodes
know which of these two states was the initial majority state, even if that
majority was just by a single vote.
  Alistarh and Gelashvili [ICALP 2015] showed a leader-election protocol which
converges in $O(\log^3 n)$ time w.h.p. and in expectation and needs
$\Theta(\log^3 n)$ states per agent. We present a protocol which elects the
leader in $O(\log^2 n)$ time w.h.p. and in expectation and uses $\Theta(\log^2
n)$ states per agent. For the exact majority voting, we show a population
protocol with the same asymptotic performance: $O(\log^2 n)$ time and
$\Theta(\log^2 n)$ states per agent. The exact-majority protocol proposed by
Alistarh et al. [PODC 2015] achieves expected $O(\log^2 n)$ time, but requires
a relatively high initial imbalance between $A$'s and $B$'s or a large number
of states per agent. More recently, Alistarh et al. [SODA 2017] showed
$O(\log^2 n)$-state protocols for both problems, with the exact majority
protocol converging in time $O(\log^3 n)$, and the leader election protocol
converging in time $O(\log^{6.3} n)$ w.h.p. and $O(\log^{5.3} n)$ in
expectation.
  Our leader election and exact majority protocols are based on the idea of
agents counting their local interactions and rely on the probabilistic fact
that the uniform random selection would limit the divergence of the individual
counts.

polymorphic functions behave uniformly: they produce related results on related

uniformity proofs can be expressed internally, and generated as a program
translation.
  We present a new parametricity translation for a significant fragment of Coq.
Previous translations of parametrically polymorphic propositions allowed
non-uniformity. For example, on related instantiations, a function may return
propositions that are logically inequivalent (e.g. True and False). We show
that uniformity of polymorphic propositions is not achievable in general.
Nevertheless, our translation produces proofs that the two propositions are
logically equivalent and also that any two proofs of those propositions are
related. This is achieved at the cost of potentially requiring more assumptions
on the instantiations, requiring them to be isomorphic in the worst case.
  Our translation augments the previous one for Coq by carrying and
compositionally building extra proofs about parametricity relations. It is made
easier by a new method for translating inductive types and pattern matching.
The new method builds upon and generalizes previous such translations for
dependently-typed programming languages.
  Using reification and reflection, we have implemented our translation as Coq
programs. We obtain several stronger free theorems applicable to an ongoing
compiler-correctness project. Previously, proofs of some of these theorems took

of HH 1165 is a Class I proto-brown dwarf, Mayrit 1701117 (M1701117), with a
total (dust+gas) mass of ~36 MJup and a bolometric luminosity of ~0.1 Lsun.
High-resolution VLT/UVES spectra of M1701117 show a wealth of emission lines
indicative of strong outflow and accretion activity. SOAR/Goodman
low-resolution spectra along the jet axis show an asymmetrical morphology for
HH 1165. We find a puzzling picture wherein the north-west part exhibits a
classical HH jet running into a pre-dominantly neutral medium, while the
southern part resembles an externally irradiated jet. The C-shaped bending in
HH 1165 may be produced by the combined effects from the massive stars in the
ionization front to the east, the sigma Orionis core to the west, and the close
proximity to the B2-type star HR 1950. HH 1165 shows all of the signatures to

obtain quantum state resolved cross sections or emission spectra for the
radiative association process. The calculated semiclassical state resolved

use of the IR luminosity (LIR) as a constrain on the physical parameters of

properties of galaxies in relation with their location on the SFR-M* diagram.
We perform SED fitting of the UV-NIR and FIR emissions of a large sample of
GOODS-Herschel galaxies, for which rich multi-wavelength observations are
available. We test different SFHs and imposing energy conservation in the SED
fitting process, to face issues like the age-extinction degeneracy and produce
SEDs consistent with observations. Our models work well for the majority of the
sample, with the notable exception of the high LIR end, for which we have
indications that our simple energy conservation approach cannot hold true. We
find trends in the SFHs fitting our sources depending on stellar mass M* and z.
Trends also emerge in the characteristic timescales of the SED models depending
on the location on the SFR-M* diagram. We show that whilst using the same
available observational data, we can produce galaxies less star-forming than
usually inferred, if we allow declining SFHs, while properly reproducing their
observables. These sources can be post-starbursts undergoing quenching, and
their SFRs are potentially overestimated if inferred from their LIR. Fitting
without the IR constrain leads to a strong preference for declining SFHs, while
its inclusion increases the preference of rising SFHs, more so at high z, in
tentative agreement with the cosmic star formation history. Keeping in mind
that the sample is biased towards high LIR, the evolution shaped by our model
appears as both bursty (initially) and steady-lasting (later on). The global
SFH of the sample follows the cosmic SFH with a small scatter, and is
compatible with the ""downsizing"" scenario of galaxy evolution.

microwave background (CMB), as inferred from nearly all-sky maps, is very close
to zero on large angular scales. A statistic invented to quantify this feature,
$S_{1/2}$, has a value sufficiently low that only about 7 in 1000 simulations
generated assuming the standard cosmological model have lower values; i.e., it
has a $p$-value of 0.007. As such, it is one of several unusual features of the
CMB sky on large scales, including the low value of the observed CMB
quadrupole, whose importance is unclear: are they multiple and independent
clues about physics beyond the cosmological standard model, or an expected
consequence of our ability to find signals in Gaussian noise? We find they are
not independent: using only simulations with quadrupole values near the
observed one, the $S_{1/2}$ $p$-value increases from 0.007 to 0.08. We also
find strong evidence that corrections for a ""look-elsewhere effect"" are large.
To do so, we use a one-dimensional generalization of the $S_{1/2}$ statistic,
and select along the one dimension for the statistic that is most extreme.
Subjecting our simulations to this process increases the $p$-value from 0.007
to 0.03; a result similar to that found in Planck XVI (2016). We argue that
this optimization process along the one dimension provides an $underestimate$
of the look-elsewhere effect correction for the historical human process of
selecting the $S_{1/2}$ statistic from a very high-dimensional space of

the temporal boundaries of the sliding windows. The salient aspect of the
refinement process is that, inside each stage, the temporal boundaries are
adjusted in a cascaded way by feeding the refined windows back to the system

approximately correlates with the formation of an electron channel below an
electrode. Effects on transport threshold, such as metal-insulator-transition
and lateral confinement are non-negligible and included. We compare these

which may lead to selection for immune-resistant viral variants within the
host. For example, during HIV infection, an array of CTL immune response
populations recognize specific epitopes (viral proteins) presented on the
surface of infected cells to effectively mediate their killing. However HIV can
rapidly evolve resistance to CTL attack at different epitopes, inducing a
dynamic network of interacting viral and immune response variants. We consider
models for the network of virus and immune response populations, consisting of
Lotka-Volterra-like systems of ordinary differential equations. Stability of
feasible equilibria and corresponding uniform persistence of distinct variants
are characterized via a Lyapunov function. We specialize the model to a ""binary
sequence"" setting, where for $n$ epitopes there can be $2^n$ distinct viral
variants mapped on a hypercube graph. The dynamics in several cases are
analyzed and sharp polychotomies are derived characterizing persistent
variants. In particular, we prove that if the viral fitness costs for gaining
resistance to each epitope are equal, then the system of $2^n$ virus strains
converges to a ""perfectly nested network"" with less than or equal to $n+1$
persistent virus strains. Overall, our results suggest that immunodominance,
i.e. relative strength of immune response to an epitope, is the most important
factor determining the persistent network structure.

  Assessment",,,,,"math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transient stability assessment of power systems needs to account for
increased risk from uncertainties due to the integration of renewables and
distributed generators. The uncertain operating condition of the power grid
hinders reliable assessment of transient stability. Conventional approaches
such as time-domain simulations and direct energy methods are computationally
expensive to take account of uncertainties. This paper proposes a reachability
analysis approach that computes bounds of the possible trajectories from
uncertain initial conditions. The eigenvalue decomposition is used to construct
a polytopic template with a scalable number of hyperplanes that is guaranteed
to converge near the equilibrium. The proposed algorithm bounds the possible
states at a given time with a polytopic template and solves the evolution of
the polytope over time. The problem is solved with linear programming
relaxation based on outer-approximations of nonlinear functions, which is
scalable for large scale systems. We demonstrate our method on IEEE test cases
to certify the stability and bound the state trajectories.

challenging problems in elastic optical networks which is normally formulated
as an MINLP optimization program. In this paper, we focus on novel properties
of geometric optimization and provide a heuristic approach for resource
allocation which is very faster than its MINLP counterpart. Our heuristic
consists of two main parts for routing/traffic ordering and power/spectrum
assignment. It aims at minimization of transmitted optical power and spectrum
usage constrained to quality of service and physical requirements. We consider
three routing/traffic ordering procedures and compare them in terms of total
transmitted optical power, total received noise power and total nonlinear
interference including self- and cross-channel interferences. We propose a
posynomial expression for optical signal to noise ratio in which fiber
nonlinearities and spontaneous emission noise have been addressed. We also
propose posynomial expressions that relate modulation spectral efficiency to
its corresponding minimum required optical signal to noise ratio. We then use
the posynomial expressions to develop six geometric formulations for
power/spectrum assignment part of the heuristic which are different in run
time, complexity and accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
solution has a very good accuracy and much lower computational complexity in
comparison with MINLP formulation. As example for European Cost239 optical
network with 46 transmit transponders, the geometric formulations can be more
than 59 times faster than its MINLP counterpart. Numerical results also reveal
that in long-haul elastic optical networks, considering the product of the
number of common fiber spans and the transmission bit rate is a better goal
function for routing/traffic ordering sub-problem.

analysis (PCA) is a traditional technique for unsupervised dimensionality

the performance of PCA will quickly drop. An supervised dimensionality
reduction algorithm called Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) seeks for an

both the linear and nonlinear structures of original data, but also learn the
pattern shrinking to make the data more flexible to fit the manifold structure.
Further, LSDA has more strong generalization performance, whose objective

supercooled water droplets as a function of both droplet radius R and
temperature T, taking account of both volume-based and surface-stimulated
nucleation modes. Its crucial idea is that, even in the surface-stimulated mode
crystal nuclei initially emerge (as sub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the
sub-surface layer, not ""pseudo-heterogeneously"" at the surface. This mode is
negligible in large droplets, but becomes increasingly important with
decreasing droplet size and is dominant in small droplets. The crossover
droplet radius for the transition of homogeneous ice nucleation from the
volume-based mode to the surface-stimulated mode nonmonotonically depends on T
from 233 K to 239.5 K, ranging there from about 2 microns to about 100 microns.
Using experimental data on ice nucleation rates in small droplets, we determine
that the ice-air interfacial tension of basal facets of ice crystals
monotonically increases from about 89 dyn/cm at T=234.8 K to about 91 dyn/cm at
T=236.2 K.

different flows: an informative flow (positive transfer entropy) based on fish

(negative transfer entropy) based on fish that have not turned yet about fish

high number densities of LAEs recently claimed by Matthee/Santos et al.'s

is very steep ($\alpha \simeq -2.5$), although it is also possible that the
bright-end LF results are enhanced by systematic effects such as the
contribution from AGNs, blended merging galaxies, and/or large ionized bubbles
around bright LAEs. Comparing our Ly$\alpha$ LF measurements with four
independent reionization models, we estimate the neutral hydrogen fraction of
the IGM to be $x_{\rm HI}=0.3\pm0.2$ at $z=$6.6 that is consistent with the

node $v$, there exists a node $w \in D$ at distance at most $k$ from $v$. Our
aim is the deterministic distributed construction of small $T$-dominating sets
in time $T$ in networks modeled as undirected $n$-node graphs and under the
$\cal{LOCAL}$ communication model.
  For any positive integer $T$, if $b$ is the size of a pairwise disjoint
collection of balls of radii at least $T$ in a graph, then $b$ is an obvious
lower bound on the size of a $T$-dominating set. Our first result shows that,
even on rings, it is impossible to construct a $T$-dominating set of size $s$
asymptotically $b$ (i.e., such that $s/b \rightarrow 1$) in time $T$.
  In the range of time $T \in \Theta (\log^* n)$, the size of a $T$-dominating
set turns out to be very sensitive to multiplicative constants in running time.
Indeed, it follows from \cite{KP}, that for time $T=\gamma \log^* n$ with large
constant $\gamma$, it is possible to construct a $T$-dominating set whose size
is a small fraction of $n$. By contrast, we show that, for time $T=\alpha
\log^* n $ for small constant $\alpha$, the size of a $T$-dominating set must
be a large fraction of $n$.
  Finally, when $T \in o (\log^* n)$, the above lower bound implies that, for
any constant $x<1$, it is impossible to construct a $T$-dominating set of size
smaller than $xn$, even on rings. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm
that constructs a $T$-dominating set of size $n- \Theta(T)$ on all graphs.

BDD reasoning and satisfiability checking. In its typical operation, GL
recursively traverses a term, computing a symbolic object representing the
value of each subterm. In older versions of GL, such a symbolic object could
use Boolean functions to compactly represent many possible values for integer
and Boolean subfields, but otherwise needed to reflect the concrete structure
of all possiblealues that its term might take. When a term has many possible
values that can't share such a representation, this can easily cause blowups
because GL must then case-split. To address this problem, we have added several
features to GL that allow it to reason about term-like symbolic objects using
various forms of rewriting. These features allow GL to be programmed with rules
much like the ACL2 rewriter, so that users may choose a better normal form for
terms for which the default, value-like representation would otherwise cause
case explosions. In this paper we describe these new features; as a motivating
example, we show how to program the rewriter to reason effectively about the
theory of records.

allowing shorter values of {\tau}, while the IPUA along the y direction has the
opposite effect. The magnetic interactions between the nanodisks along x and y
directions (the coupling integrals) as a function of the uniaxial anisotropy

essential characteristic of an active agent, out of proper thermodynamic

the traditional one. A choice of an axiom whether one treats a portion of

in the future fifth generation (5G) networks. However, the potential large
random access (RA) delay calls for a new RA scheme and for a detailed
assessment of its performance. Motivated by the key idea of non-orthogonal
multiple access, the non-orthogonal random access (NORA) scheme based on
successive interference cancellation (SIC) is proposed in this paper to
alleviate the access congestion problem. Specifically, NORA utilizes the
difference of time of arrival to identify multiple UEs with the identical
preamble, and enables power domain multiplexing of collided UEs in the
following access process, while the base station performs SIC based on the
channel conditions obtained through preamble detection. Our analysis show that
the performance of NORA is superior to the conventional orthogonal random
access (ORA) scheme in terms of the preamble collision probability, access
success probability and throughput of random access. Simulation results verify
our analysis and further show that our NORA scheme can improve the number of
the supported UEs by more than 30%. Moreover, the number of preamble
transmissions and the access delay for successfully accessed UEs are also
reduced significantly by using the proposed random access scheme.

We first define a notion of weak solution of CSCK for an $L^\infty$ K\""ahler

$L^\infty$ bound) is smooth. As an application, this answers in part a
conjecture of Chen regarding the regularity of $K$-energy minimizers. The new
technical ingredient is a $W^{2, 2}$ regularity result for the Laplacian
equation $\Delta_g u=f$ on K\""ahler manifolds, where the metric has only
$L^\infty$ coefficients. It is well-known that such a $W^{2, 2}$ regularity
($W^{2, p}$ regularity for any $p>1$) fails in general (except for dimension
two) for uniform elliptic equations of the form $a^{ij}\partial^2_{ij}u=f$ for
$a^{ij}\in L^\infty$, without certain smallness assumptions on the local
oscillation of $a^{ij}$. We observe that the K\""ahler condition plays an

increase in the asymmetry of the energy landscape in the transition region. The
rate limiting parameter diffusion constant over the diffusive barrier, rate
constant at particular force and transition path time for different potentials

bounds in spiral galaxies of all morphologies. Dwarf galaxies serve as an
increasingly interesting case of rotation curve dynamics due to their typically
rising rotation curve as opposed to the flattening curve of large spirals.
These galaxies usually vary in galactic structure and mostly terminate at small
radial distances. This, coupled with the fact that Cold Dark Matter theories
struggle with the universality of galactic rotation curves, allow for exclusive
features of alternative gravitational models to be analyzed. Recently, the
THINGS (The HI Nearby Galactic Survey) has been extended to include a sample of
25 dwarf galaxies now known as the LITTLE THINGS Survey. Here, we present a
thorough application of alternative gravitational models to the LITTLE THINGS
survey, specifically focusing on conformal gravity and Modified Newtonian
Dynamics. An analysis and discussion of the results of the fitting procedure of
the two alternative gravitational models are explored, as well as the resulting
rotation curve predictions of each. Further, we show how these two alternative
gravitational models account for the recently observed universal trends in
centripetal accelerations in spiral galaxies. We posit here that both conformal
gravity and MOND can provide an accurate description of the galactic dynamics
without the need for dark matter.

pile-up scenarios which significantly contribute to physics events as a
background. While state-of-the-art tracking algorithms and detector concepts
take care of these event pile-up scenarios, several offline analytical
techniques are used to remove such events from the physics analysis. It is
still difficult to identify the remaining pile-up events in an event sample for
physics analysis. Since the fraction of these events is significantly small, it
may not be as serious of an issue for other analysis as it would be for an
event-by-event analysis. Particularly, when the characteristics of the
multiplicity distribution are observable, one needs to be very careful. In the
present work, we demonstrate how a small fraction of residual pile-up events
can change the moments and their ratios of an event-by-event net-proton
multiplicity distribution, which are sensitive to the dynamical fluctuations
due to the QCD critical point. For this study we assume that the individual
event-by-event proton and antiproton multiplicity distributions follow Poisson,
negative binomial or binomial distributions. We observe a significant effect in
cumulants and their ratios of net-proton multiplicity distributions due to
pile-up events, particularly at lower energies. It might be crucial to estimate
the fraction of pile-up events in the data sample while interpreting the

resampling problem by merging non-redundant data from multiple low-resolution
(LR) images on a finer high-resolution (HR) grid, while inverting the effect of
the camera point spread function (PSF). One main problem with multiview methods
is that resampling from nonuniform samples (provided by LR images) and the
inversion of the PSF are highly nonlinear and ill-posed problems. Non-linearity
and ill-posedness are typically overcome by linearization and regularization,
often through an iterative optimization process, which essentially trade off
the very same information (i.e. high frequency) that we want to recover. We
propose a novel point of view for multiview SRIR: Unlike existing multiview
methods that reconstruct the entire spectrum of the HR image from the multiple
given LR images, we derive explicit expressions that show how the
high-frequency spectra of the unknown HR image are related to the spectra of
the LR images. Therefore, by taking any of the LR images as the reference to
represent the low-frequency spectra of the HR image, one can reconstruct the
super-resolution image by focusing only on the reconstruction of the
high-frequency spectra. This is very much like single-image methods, which
extrapolate the spectrum of one image, except that we rely on information
provided by all other views, rather than by prior constraints as in
single-image methods (which may not be an accurate source of information). This
is made possible by deriving and applying explicit closed-form expressions that
define how the local high frequency information that we aim to recover for the
reference high resolution image is related to the local low frequency
information in the sequence of views. Results and comparisons with recently
published state-of-the-art methods show the superiority of the proposed
solution.

bind together to form quasiparticles with integer quantum numbers. The
constituent particles are confined by an attractive interaction whose strength
increases with increasing particle separation and as a consequence, individual
particles are not found in isolation. This phenomenon is well known in particle
physics where quarks are confined in baryons and mesons. An analogous
phenomenon occurs in certain magnetic insulators; weakly coupled chains of
spins S=1/2. The collective excitations in these systems is spinons (S=1/2). At
low temperatures weak coupling between chains can induce an attractive
interaction between pairs of spinons that increases with their separation and
thus leads to confinement. In this paper, we employ inelastic neutron
scattering to investigate the spinon confinement in the quasi-1D S=1/2 XXZ
antiferromagnet SrCo2V2O8. Spinon excitations are observed above TN in
quantitative agreement with established theory. Below TN the pairs of spinons
are confined and two sequences of meson-like bound states with longitudinal and
transverse polarizations are observed. Several theoretical approaches are used
to explain the data. A new theoretical technique based on Tangent-space Matrix
Product States gives a very complete description of the data and provides good
agreement not only with the energies of the bound modes but also with their
intensities. We also successfully explained the effect of temperature on the
excitations including the experimentally observed thermally induced resonance
between longitudinal modes below TN ,and the transitions between thermally
excited spinon states above TN. In summary, our work establishes SrCo2V2O8 as a
beautiful paradigm for spinon confinement in a quasi-1D quantum magnet and
provides a comprehensive picture of this process.

in CRSNs needs special attention as Primary Radio (PR) nodes traffic must be
protected from any harmful interference by Cognitive Radio (CR) nodes. On the
other hand, CR nodes need to communicate without interruption to meet their
data rate requirements. If CR nodes perform frequent channel switching due to
PR traffic then it will be difficult to meet their quality of service (QoS) and
data rate requirements. So, CR nodes need to select those channels which are
stable. By stable, we mean those channels which cause less harmful interference

This is in stark contrast with methods that compute a recursive expansion of

allows to define modulation of index of refraction and thickness of the
holographic layer for each of the gratings as well as their fringes frequencies
and inclination angles. At the first stage the gratings parameters are found
approximately using analytical expressions of Kogelnik's coupled wave theory.
Then each of the grating starting from the longwave sub-range is optimized
separately by using of numerical optimization procedure and rigorous coupled
wave analysis to achieve a high diffraction efficiency profile with a steep
shortwave edge. In parallel such targets as ray aiming and linear dispersion
maintenance are controlled by means of ray tracing. We demonstrate this
technique on example of a small-sized spectrograph for astronomical
applications. It works in the range of 500-650 nm and uses three gratings

one-dimensional strongly interacting fermion systems, which makes it a
cornerstone in quantum many-body theory. Yet, this success comes at the expense
of using effective infrared parameters, and restricting the description to low
energy states near the Fermi level. We propose a radical extension of the
bosonization technique that overcomes both limitations, allowing computations
with microscopic lattice Hamiltonians, from the Fermi level down to the bottom
of the band. The formalism rests on the simple idea of representing the fermion
kinetic term in the energy domain, after which it can be expressed in terms of
free bosonic degrees of freedom. As a result, one- and two-body fermionic
scattering processes generate anharmonic boson-boson interactions, even in the
forward channel. We show that up to moderate interaction strengths, these
nonlinearities can be treated analytically at all energy scales, using the
x-ray emission problem as a showcase. In the strong interaction regime, we
employ a systematic variational solution of the bosonic theory, and obtain
results that agree quantitatively with an exact diagonalization of the original
one-particle fermionic model. This provides a proof of the fully microscopic
character of bosonization on all energy scales for an arbitrary band structure.
Besides recovering the known x-ray edge singularity at the emission threshold,
we find strong signatures of correlations even at emission frequencies beyond
the band bottom.

the habitable zone. The distance of the starshade from the planet that
minimizes its mass is 1.6 times the Earth-L1 distance. Such a starshade would
have to be similar in size to the planet and the mutual occultations during
planetary transits could produce a characteristic maximum at mid-transit in the

suffer from a lack of compactness and can be brought in a similar form of a
Lagrangian System on the half time line by a regularising change of coordinates

which is suitable to capture the asymptotic nature of these trajectories as
half-clinic orbits: by taking into account the underlying Hamiltonian structure
we define the appropriate notion of geometric index for this class of solutions

their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However,
guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an
unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We
propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability
methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The
method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee
constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process.
We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as
the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when
appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The
result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes
only when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence in
the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove
theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis
and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle.
Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the
quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient
reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a
strong external disturbance introduced during flight.

Our aim here is to find the Galactic habitable zone using chemical evolution
models for the Milky Way disc, adopting the most recent prescriptions for the
evolution of dust and for the probability of finding planetary systems around M

terrestrial planets but not gas giant planets around M stars deviate
substantially from the ones around FGK stars for supersolar values of [Fe/H].
For both FGK and M stars the maximum number of stars hosting habitable planets
is at 8 kpc from the Galactic Centre, if destructive effects by supernova
explosions are taken into account. At the present time the total number of M
stars with habitable planets are $\simeq$ 10 times the number of FGK stars.
Moreover, we provide a sixth order polynomial fit (and a linear one but more

different ambient medium and torus configurations on the jet structure and
subsequently computed the non-thermal emission produced by the jet and the
thermal absorption due to the torus. To better compare the emission simulations
with observations we produced synthetic radio maps, taking into account the
properties of the observatory. The detailed analysis of our simulations shows
that the observed asymmetries can be produced by the interaction of the jet
with the ambient medium and by the absorption properties of the obscuring

power from a centralised firm at a price the firm sets. Distributed generation
is intermittent and induces an externality cost to the consumer. The firm
provides non-random electricity generation subject to a carbon tax and to
transmission costs. The objective of the consumer is to satisfy her demand
while mini\-mising investment costs, payments to the firm and intermittency
costs. The objective of the firm is to satisfy the consumer's residual demand

planner's point of view, the carbon tax or transmission costs are necessary to
justify a positive share of distributed capacity in the long-term, whatever the

sequence of empirical minimum volume sets whose levels are chosen adaptively
from the data, so as to adjust to the variations of the optimal MV curve, while
controling the bias of its approximation by a stepwise curve. Generalization

tunnel junction is the most developed spintronic memory device in which the
magnetization of the storage layer is switched by spin-transfer-torque or
spin-orbit torque interactions. Whereas these novel spin-torque interactions
exemplify the potential of electron-spin-based devices and memory, the
switching speed is limited to the ns regime by the precessional motion of the
magnetization. All-optical magnetization switching, based on the inverse
Faraday effect, has been shown to be an attractive method for achieving
magnetization switching at ps speeds. Successful magnetization reversal in thin
films has been demonstrated by using circularly polarized light. However, a
method for all-optical switching of on-chip nanomagnets in high density memory
modules has not been described. In this work we propose to use plasmonics, with

order to investigate this point precisely, we consider the mechanism of the

the sense of 4-dimensional fields. Therefore, the local current is obtained by
subtracting the bulk contribution from it.

be exploited to generate a common secret key between two legitimate

estimated and processed. However, the entropy and thus quality of the generated
key depends on the channel coherence time. This can result in poor key
generation rates in a low mobility environment, where the fading gains are
nearly constant. Therefore, wide-spread deployment of wireless channel-based
secret key generation is limited. To overcome these issues, we follow up on a
recent idea which uses unknown random pilots and enables ""on-the-fly"" key
generation. In addition, the scheme is able to incorporate local sources of
randomness but performance bounds are hard to obtain with standard methods. In
this paper, we analyse such a scheme analytically and derive achievable key
rates in the Alice-Bob-Eve setting. For this purpose, we develop a novel
approximation model which is inspired by the linear deterministic and the lower

theoretically predict energy spectra of particle and anti-particle degrees of

transverse momentum spectra and hard QCD scattering processes. QCD at largest
center of mass energies predicts the entropic index to be $q=\frac{13}{11}$,
whereas the escort duality of the nonextensive thermodynamic formalism predicts
an energy split of effective temperature given by $\Delta kT =\pm \frac{1}{10}

carefully analyse the measured primary cosmic ray data of the AMS-02
collaboration and provide evidence that the predicted temperature split is
indeed observed, leading to a different energy dependence of the $e^+$ and
$e^-$ spectral indices. Moreover, we observe that at larger energies $E$ the
measured $e^+e^-$ flux starts to deviate from our QCD-based statistical
mechanics theory, with a crossover scale of $E^*=(50 \pm 10)$ GeV, which could
be a hint for WIMP decay or other new physics setting in at this mass scale.
Fits using linear combinations of the escort and non-escort $q$-generalized

is shown that, of the two linear modes, acoustic and optical, only one is

the dynamics of a single layer. However, the non-linear parameters values can
be controlled by the parameters of the synthetic ferrimagnet. With a strong
coupling between the two layers and asymmetric layers (different thicknesses),
it is demonstrated that the non-linear frequency shift can be reduced, which
results in the reduction of the linewidth of the power spectral density. For a
particular applied field, the non-linear parameter can even vanish; this
corresponds to a transition between a red-shift and a blue-shift frequency

two different types of chimera states, phase-chimera state and
excitability-chimera states, depending on the coupling strength. At weak
coupling strength where collective oscillation is localized around the unstable
homogeneous equilibrium, the chimera states are similar to the ones in
nonlocally coupled phase oscillators. For the chimera states at strong coupling
strength, the dynamics of both coherent units and incoherent units shift back

chemical abundance spreads in light elements. We discuss a new GC formation
scenario based on hierarchical star formation within fractal molecular clouds.
In the new scenario, a cluster of bound and unbound star clusters (`star
cluster complex', SCC) that have a power-law cluster mass function with a slope
(beta) of 2 is first formed from a massive gas clump developed in a dwarf
galaxy. Such cluster complexes and beta=2 are observed and expected from
hierarchical star formation. The most massive star cluster (`main cluster'),
which is the progenitor of a GC, can accrete gas ejected from asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars initially in the cluster and other low-mass clusters before
the clusters are tidally stripped or destroyed to become field stars in the
dwarf. The SCC is initially embedded in a giant gas hole created by numerous
supernovae of the SCC so that cold gas outside the hole can be accreted onto
the main cluster later. New stars formed from the accreted gas have chemical
abundances that are different from those of the original SCC. Using
hydrodynamical simulations of GC formation based on this scenario, we show that
the main cluster with the initial mass as large as [2-5]x10^5 Msun can accrete
more than 10^5 Msun gas from AGB stars of the SCC. We suggest that merging of
hierarchical star cluster complexes can play key roles in stellar halo
formation around GCs and self-enrichment processes of GCs.

  Information-Centric Fogs",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information-Centric Fog Computing enables a multitude of nodes near the
end-users to provide storage, communication, and computing, rather than in the
cloud. In a fog network, nodes connect with each other directly to get content
locally whenever possible. As the topology of the network directly influences
the nodes' connectivity, there has been some work to compute the graph
centrality of each node within that network topology. The centrality is then
used to distinguish nodes in the fog network, or to prioritize some nodes over
others to participate in the caching fog. We argue that, for an
Information-Centric Fog Computing approach, graph centrality is not an
appropriate metric. Indeed, a node with low connectivity that caches a lot of
content may provide a very valuable role in the network.
  To capture this, we introduce acontent-based centrality (CBC) metric which
takes into account how well a node is connected to the content the network is
delivering, rather than to the other nodes in the network. To illustrate the
validity of considering content-based centrality, we use this new metric for a
collaborative caching algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed
collaborative caching with typical centrality based, non-centrality based, and
non-collaborative caching mechanisms. Our simulation implements CBC on three
instances of large scale realistic network topology comprising 2,896 nodes with
three content replication levels. Results shows that CBC outperforms benchmark
caching schemes and yields a roughly 3x improvement for the average cache hit
rate.

combine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an
explicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical
constraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to
jointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over
multiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the
motion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under
small baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search
problem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is
treated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method.
The resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art

possibly different radii, large motions, immersed in an perfect stagnant fluid.
We show that the fluid force is the superposition of an added mass term,
related to the time variations of the potential, and a quadratic term related
to its spatial variations. We provide new simple and exact analytical
expressions for the fluid added mass coefficients, in which the effect of the
confinement is made explicit. The self-added mass (resp. cross-added mass) is
shown to decrease (resp. increase) with the separation distance and increase
(resp. decreases) with the radius ratio. We then consider the case in which one
cylinder translates along the line joining the centers with a constant speed.
We show that the two cylinders are repelled from each other, with a force that
diverges to infinity at impact. We extend our approach to the case in which one
cylinder is imposed a sinusoidal vibration. We show that the force on the
stationnary cylinder and the vibration displacement have opposite (resp.
identical) axial (resp. transverse) directions. For large vibration amplitudes,
this force is strongly altered by the nonlinear effects induced by the spatial
variations of the potential. The force on the vibrating cylinder is in phase
with the imposed displacement and is mainly driven by the added mass term. The
results of this paper are of particular interest for engineers who need to grab

used to describe motion of the domain wall in presence of the spin Hall effect.
We show that the domain wall center has second harmonic frequency response in
addition to the known first harmonic excitation. In contrast to the
experimentally observed second harmonic response in harmonic Hall measurements
of spin-orbit torque in magnetic thin films, this second harmonic response
directly originates from spin-orbit torque driven domain wall dynamics. Based
on the spin current generated by domain wall dynamics, the longitudinal spin
motive force generated voltage across the length of the nanowire is determined.
The second harmonic response introduces additionally a new practical field-free

bilayer structures that could be applied in experiments. Our results also
demonstrate the capability of utilizing FM/NM bilayer structure in domain wall
based spin torque signal generators and resonators.

We show how to circumvent this difficulty through the use of Lagrangian
duality. While such an approach is well-known it is normally not guaranteed to

signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and achievable information rates (AIRs) in a
back-to-back configuration and in unrepeated nonlinear fiber transmissions. For
back-to-back, various shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
distributions are found to have the same implementation penalty as uniform
input. By demonstrating in transmission experiments that shaped QAM input leads
to lower effective SNR than uniform input at a fixed average launch power, we
experimentally confirm that shaping enhances the fiber nonlinearities. However,
shaping is ultimately found to increase the AIR, which is the most relevant
figure of merit as it is directly related to spectral efficiency. In a detailed
study of these shaping gains for the nonlinear fiber channel, four strategies
for optimizing QAM input distributions are evaluated and experimentally
compared in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The first shaping
scheme generates a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution based on a linear
additive white Gaussian noise channel. The second strategy uses the
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to optimize an unconstrained QAM distribution for a
split-step Fourier method based channel model. In the third and fourth
approach, MB-shaped QAM and unconstrained QAM are optimized via the enhanced
Gaussian noise (EGN) model. Although the absolute shaping gains are found to be
relatively small, the relative improvements by EGN-optimized unconstrained
distributions over linear AWGN optimized MB distributions are up to 59%. This
general behavior is observed in 9-channel and fully loaded WDM experiments.

Mermin's operator with suitable choice of directions. Moreover these operators
may be implemented in an experiment to distinguish the types of entanglement

sufficient to distinguish GHZ class from rest of the classes. It is also shown
that it is possible to detect and classify other classes by performing a small

between individual mobile networks operators for a variety of reasons. End user
network switching and multihoming are two promising mechanisms that could allow
such exploitation. However these mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored
at a general system level with QoE metrics. Therefore, in this work we analyze
these mechanisms in a variety of diverse scenarios through a system level model
based on an agent based modeling framework. In terms of results, we find that
in all scenarios end user network switching provides significant benefits in
terms of both throughput and mean opinion score as the number of available
networks increases. However, contrastingly, end user multihoming in most
scenarios does not provide significant benefits over network switching given
the same number of available networks. The major reason is inefficient radio
resource allocation resulting from individual networks not taking the
multihoming nature of end users into account. Though, in low user density
situations this inefficiency is not a problem and multihoming does provide
increased throughput though not increased mean opinion scores. Finally,
scenarios that vary the fraction of users adopting multihoming suggests that
both early and late adopters will have similar gains over users not adopting
multihoming. Thus the adoption dynamics of multihoming appear favorable.
Overall, the results support the applicability of end user network switching

of information, there is no doubt that this is an era of big data. One of the
important sources for scientific big data is the datasets collected by Internet
of things (IoT). It's considered that these datesets contain highly useful and
valuable information. For an IoT application to analyze big sensor data, it is
necessary that the data are clean and lossless. However, due to unreliable
wireless link or hardware failure in the nodes, data loss in IoT is very
common. To reconstruct the missing big sensor data, firstly, we propose an
algorithm based on matrix rank-minimization method. Then, we consider IoT with
multiple types of sensor in each node. Accounting for possible correlations
among multiple-attribute sensor data, we propose tensor-based methods to
estimate missing values. Moreover, effective solutions are proposed using the
alternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, we evaluate the
approaches using two real sensor datasets with two missing data-patterns, i.e.,
random missing pattern and consecutive missing pattern. The experiments with
real-world sensor data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Here, we report the experimental measurements and equilibrium molecular dynamic

modulated from 0.33 to 0.51 Wm-1K-1 by changing the crosslinking density. The

quantum information application. Based on the no-cloning property of quantum
mechanics, this scheme allows for the creation of credit cards used in
authenticated transactions offering security guarantees impossible to achieve
by classical means. However, despite its central role in quantum cryptography,
its experimental implementation has remained elusive because of the lack of
quantum memories and of practical verification techniques. Here, we
experimentally implement a quantum money protocol relying on classical
verification that rigorously satisfies the security condition for
unforgeability. Our system exploits polarization encoding of weak coherent
states of light and operates under conditions that ensure compatibility with
state-of-the-art quantum memories. We derive working regimes for our system
using a security analysis taking into account all practical imperfections. Our
results constitute a major step towards a real-world realization of this
milestone protocol.

In this work, we report on electrical and magnetotransport measurements of
high-quality graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene. We show that the substitutional
nitrogen dopants in graphene introduce atomically sharp scatters for electrons
but long-range Coulomb scatters for holes and, thus, graphitic nitrogen-doped
graphene exhibits clear electron-hole asymmetry in transport properties.
Dominant scattering processes of charge carriers in graphitic nitrogen-doped
graphene are analyzed. It is shown that the electron-hole asymmetry originates
from a distinct difference in intervalley scattering of electrons and holes. We
have also carried out the magnetotransport measurements of graphitic
nitrogen-doped graphene at different temperatures and the temperature
dependences of intervalley scattering, intravalley scattering and phase
coherent scattering rates are extracted and discussed. Our results provide an
evidence for the electron-hole asymmetry in the intervalley scattering induced

scalar field in Fock quantization is inversely proportional to the invariant
distance squared between the corresponding spacetime points. Naturally it
diverges when these two points are taken to be infinitesimally close to each
other. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that
the Wightman function is bounded from above in polymer quantization of scalar
field. The bounded value of the Wightman function is governed by the polymer

polymer quantization of matter field alone as the geometry is treated

correspondence with the parity-spin $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ structure of a Dirac

interactions, the lattice-layer degrees of freedom can be mapped into such a
parity-spin two-qubit basis which supports the interpretation of the bilayer

of quantum concurrence, in order to have the influence of mass and bias voltage

actively suppresses the intrinsic quantum entanglement of bilayer eigenstates,
the bias voltage term spreads the entanglement in the Brillouin zone around the

  JACM",,,,"cs.LO cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-player games on graphs are widely studied in formal methods as they model
the interaction between a system and its environment. The game is played by
moving a token throughout a graph to produce an infinite path. There are
several common modes to determine how the players move the token through the
graph; e.g., in turn-based games the players alternate turns in moving the
token. We study the {\em bidding} mode of moving the token, which, to the best
of our knowledge, has never been studied in infinite-duration games. The
following bidding rule was previously defined and called Richman bidding. Both
players have separate {\em budgets}, which sum up to $1$. In each turn, a
bidding takes place: Both players submit bids simultaneously, where a bid is
legal if it does not exceed the available budget, and the higher bidder pays
his bid to the other player and moves the token. The central question studied
in bidding games is a necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning the
game: a {\em threshold} budget in a vertex is a value $t \in [0,1]$ such that
if Player $1$'s budget exceeds $t$, he can win the game, and if Player $2$'s
budget exceeds $1-t$, he can win the game. Threshold budgets were previously
shown to exist in every vertex of a reachability game, which have an
interesting connection with {\em random-turn} games -- a sub-class of simple
stochastic games in which the player who moves is chosen randomly. We show the
existence of threshold budgets for a qualitative class of infinite-duration
games, namely parity games, and a quantitative class, namely mean-payoff games.
The key component of the proof is a quantitative solution to strongly-connected
mean-payoff bidding games in which we extend the connection with random-turn
games to these games, and construct explicit optimal strategies for both
players.

extreme mass ratio binary system. We show that when the mass transfer is
sufficiently fast, mass leakage occurs through the outer Lagrange point L2, in
addition to the usual transfer through L1. We provide an analytical estimate
for the mass leakage rate through L2 and find the conditions in which it is
comparable to the mass transfer rate through L1. Focusing on a binary system of
a main-sequence star and a super-massive black hole, driven by the emission of
gravitational radiation, we show that it may sustain stable mass transfer,
along with mass loss through L2. If such a mass-transferring system occurs at
our Galactic Centre, it produces a gravitational wave signal detectable by
future detectors, such as eLISA. The signal evolves according to the star's
adiabatic index and cooling time. For low mass stars, the evolution is faster
than the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling rate driving the star out of the
main-sequence. In some cases, the frequency and amplitude of the signal may
both decrease with time, contrary to the standard chirp of a coalescing binary.
Mass loss through L2, when occurs, decreases the evolution timescale of the
emitted gravitational wave signal by up to a few tens of per cent. We conclude
that L2 mass ejection is a crucial factor in analyzing gravitational waves
signals produced by such systems.

since our actions are usually defined by many degrees of freedom and therefore
occupy a large action-space. While saccadic eye-movement offers a more
constrained paradigm for investigating action selection, the study of
reach-and-grasp in upper limbs has often been defined by more complex
scenarios, not easily interpretable in terms of such selection. Here we present
a novel motor behaviour task which addresses this by limiting the action space
to a single degree of freedom in which subjects have to track (using a stylus)
a vertical coloured target line displayed on a tablet computer, whilst ignoring
a similarly oriented distractor line in a different colour. We ran this task
with 55 subjects and showed that, in agreement with previous studies, the
presence of the distractor generally increases the movement latency and
directional error rate. Further, we used two distractor conditions according to
whether the distractor's location changes asynchronously or synchronously with
the location of the target. We found that the asynchronous distractor yielded
poorer performance than its synchronous counterpart, with significantly higher
movement latencies and higher error rates. We interpret these results in an
action selection framework with two actions (move left or right) and competing
'action requests' offered by the target and distractor. As such, the results
provide insights into action selection performance in humans and supply data
for directly constraining future computational models therein.

moduli space and the Betti moduli space, defined by associating to each
Fuchsian system its monodromy representation class. In 1997 Hitchin proved that
this map is a symplectomorphism. In this paper, we address the question of what
happens to this theory if we extend the de Rham moduli space by allowing
connections with higher order poles. In our previous paper arXiv:1511.03851,
based on the idea of interpreting higher order poles in the connection as
boundary components with bordered cusps (vertices of ideal triangles in the
Poincar\'e metric) on the Riemann surface, we introduced the notion of
decorated character variety to generalize the Betti moduli space. This
decorated character variety is the quotient of the space of representations of
the fundamental groupid of arcs by a product of unipotent Borel sub-groups (one
per bordered cusp). Here we prove that this representation space is endowed
with a Poisson structure induced by the Fock--Rosly bracket and show that the
quotient by unipotent Borel subgroups giving rise to the decorated character
variety is a Poisson reduction. We deal with the Poisson bracket and its
quantization simultaneously, thus providing a quantisation of the decorated
character variety. In the case of dimension 2, we also endow the representation
space with explicit Darboux coordinates. We conclude with a conjecture on the
extended Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in the case of higher order poles.

serious lack of robustness against outliers in data and generate drastically

unexplained. In this work we revisit the spin dynamics of the pseudo-cubic
La1-xSrxMnO3 along the Mn-O-Mn bond direction at four x doping values (x < 0.5)
and various temperatures and report a new lattice dynamics study at x0=0.2,
representative of the optimal doping for CMR. We propose an interpretation of
the spin dynamics in terms of orbital polarons. This picture is supported by
the observation of a discrete magnetic energy spectrum Enmag (q) characteristic
of the internal excitations of ""orbital polarons"" defined by Mn3+ neighbors
surrounding a Mn4+ center with a hole. Because of its hopping, the hole mixes
up dynamically all the possible orbital configurations of its surrounding Mn3+
sites with degenerate energies. The Enmag values indicate a lift of orbital
degeneracy by phonon excitations. The number n varies with the spatial
dimension D of the polaron and the q-range determines its size. At x=0.125 and
x=0.3 the spectrum reveals 2D polarons coupled by exchange and 3D ""free""
polarons respectively, with sizes l=1.67a < 2a in all bond directions. At
x0=0.2, the spin and the lattice dynamics provide evidence for chains of
orbital polarons of size l=2a with a periodic distribution over ~ 3a and an
interaction energy ~ 3 meV. At T < Tc the charges propagate together with the
longitudinal acoustic phonons along the chains enhancing their ferromagnetic
character. The phase separation between metallic and ferromagnetic chains in a
non-metallic matrix may be crucial for CMR.

maximum satisfiability over Horn formulas. Given the new transformation, the
paper proves a polynomial bound on the number of MaxSAT resolution steps for
pigeonhole formulas. This result is in clear contrast with earlier results on
the length of proofs of MaxSAT resolution for pigeonhole formulas. The paper
also establishes the same polynomial bound in the case of modern core-guided

Essential hardware for braiding is a network of single-crystalline nanowires

dynamical Gaussian processes (GPs) via GP regression from sparse and noisy
data. GPs have been mainly applied to spatial regression where they represent
one of the most powerful estimation approaches also thanks to their universal
representing properties. Their extension to dynamical processes has been
instead elusive so far since classical implementations lead to unscalable
algorithms. We then propose a novel procedure to address this problem by
coupling GP regression and Kalman filtering. In particular, assuming space/time
separability of the covariance (kernel) of the process and rational time
spectrum, we build a finite-dimensional discrete-time state-space process
representation amenable of Kalman filtering. With sampling over a finite set of
fixed spatial locations, our major finding is that the Kalman filter state at
instant $t_k$ represents a sufficient statistic to compute the minimum variance
estimate of the process at any $t \geq t_k$ over the entire spatial domain.
This result can be interpreted as a novel Kalman representer theorem for
dynamical GPs. We then extend the study to situations where the set of spatial
input locations can vary over time. The proposed algorithms are finally tested
on both synthetic and real field data, also providing comparisons with standard
GP and truncated GP regression techniques.

realisations of this model have been achieved in various physical systems for
low numbers of qubits. The large number of qubits necessary to construct the
resource state constitutes one of the main down sides to MBQC. However, in some
instances it is possible to extend the resource state on the fly, meaning that
not every qubit must be realised in the devices simultaneously. We consider the
question of the minimal number of physical qubits that must be present in a

patterns with n inputs, n outputs and m total qubits which have flow, we show
that only min(n + 1, m) qubits are required, while the number of required

discuss the implications of removing the Clifford part of a measurement

of polarization should be visible. Second, the strong magnetic field in the

Results. The residual component was significantly detected only in 2007
January, even though the same region was observed in 2006 July and 2007 July,
which shows that it is not due to the Galactic emission. We suggest that this
may be a small cloud passing near the Earth. By comparing the observed
intensity ratio of I_9um/I_18um with the expected intensity ratio assuming
thermal equilibrium of dust grains at 1 AU for various dust compositions and
sizes, we find that dust grains in the moving cloud are likely to be much
smaller than typical grains that produce the bulk of the zodiacal light.

that a slight modification of the Dirac equation suffices to explain the

described on the example of a linear model with additive noise. The approach
does not use any Bayesian hypothesis regarding an unknown object; instead, the
standard statistical requirements for the procedure for finding a desired
object estimate are presented. In this way, it is possible to obtain stable and
efficient inverse solutions in the framework of classical statistical theory.
The exact representation is given for the feasible region of inverse solutions,
i.e., the set of inverse estimates that are in agreement, in the statistical
sense, with the data and available a priory information. The typical feasible
region has the form of an extremely elongated hole ellipsoid, the orientation
and shape of which are determined by the Fisher information matrix. It is the
spectrum of the Fisher matrix that provides an exhaustive description of the
stability of the inverse problem under consideration. The method of
constructing a nonlinear filter close to the optimal Kolmogorov-Wiener filter
is presented.

have produced many important predictions, experimental verifications of the

in microchannels with periodically varying width and contrast results with
predictions from the Fick-Jacobs theory and Brownian dynamics simulation. While
the theory and simulation correctly predict the entropic effect of the varying
channel width, they fail to account for hydrodynamic effects, which include
both an overall decrease and a spatial variation of diffusivity in channels.
Neglecting such hydrodynamic effects, the theory and simulation underestimate
the mean and standard deviation of first passage times by 40\% in channels with
a neck width twice the particle diameter. We further show that the validity of
the Fick-Jakobs theory can be restored by reformulating it in terms of the
experimentally measured diffusivity. Our work thus demonstrates that
hydrodynamic effects play a key role in diffusive transport through narrow
channels and should be included in theoretical and numerical models.

relationship? This study investigates social mechanisms explaining how social
ties affect well-being through social integration and social influence, and how
well-being affects social ties through social selection. We hypothesize that
highly integrated individuals - those with more extensive and dense friendship
networks - report higher emotional well-being than others. Moreover, emotional
well-being should be influenced by the well-being of close friends. Finally,
well-being should affect friendship selection when individuals prefer others
with higher levels of well-being, and others whose well-being is similar to
theirs. We test our hypotheses using longitudinal social network and well-being
data of 117 individuals living in a graduate housing community. The application
of a novel extension of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for ordered networks
(ordered SAOMs) allows us to detail and test our hypotheses for weak- and
strong-tied friendship networks simultaneously. Results do not support our
social integration and social influence hypotheses but provide evidence for
selection: individuals with higher emotional well-being tend to have more
strong-tied friends, and there are homophily processes regarding emotional
well-being in strong-tied networks. Our study highlights the two-directional
relationship between social ties and well-being, and demonstrates the
importance of considering different tie strengths for various social processes.
