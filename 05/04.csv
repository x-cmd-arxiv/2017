We first systematically analyze all possible d=7 1-loop topologies. There is a
total of 48 topologies, but only 8 of these can lead to ""genuine"" d=7 neutrino
masses. Here, we define genuine models to be models in which neither d=5 nor
d=7 tree-level masses nor a d=5 1-loop mass appear, such that the d=7 1-loop is
the leading order contribution to the neutrino masses. All genuine models can
then be organized w.r.t. their particle content. We find there is only one
diagram with no representation larger than triplet, while there are 22 diagrams
with quadruplets. We briefly discuss three minimal example models of this kind.

subsystems is neither a superposition of states of its subsystems nor a
superposition of composite states but rather a coherent superposition of
nonlocal correlations between incoherently mixed local states of the two
subsystems. Thus, even if one subsystem happens to be macroscopic as in the
entangled ""Schrodinger's cat"" state resulting from an ideal measurement, this
state is not the paradoxical macroscopic superposition it is generally presumed
to be. It is, instead, a ""macroscopic correlation,"" a coherent quantum
correlation in which one of the two correlated sub-systems happens to be
macroscopic. This clarifies the physical meaning of entanglement: When a
superposed quantum system A is unitarily entangled with a second quantum system
B, the coherence of the original superposition of different states of A is
transferred to different correlations between states of A and B, so the
entangled state becomes a superposition of correlations rather than a
superposition of states. This transfer preserves unitary evolution while
permitting B to be macroscopic without entailing a macroscopic superposition.
This resolves the ""problem of outcomes"" but is not a complete resolution of the

less resource -- typically energy -- compared to computing exact solutions.
While inexactness is motivated by concerns derived from technology scaling and
Moore's law, there is no formal or foundational framework for reasoning about
this novel approach to designing algorithms. In this work, we present a
fundamental relationship between the quality of computing the value of a
boolean function and the energy needed to compute it in a mathematically
rigorous and general setting. On this basis, one can study the tradeoff between
the quality of the solution to a problem and the amount of energy that is
consumed. We accomplish this by introducing a computational model to classify
problems based on notions of symmetry inspired by physics. We show that some
problems are symmetric in that every input bit is, in a sense, equally
important, while other problems display a great deal of asymmetry in the
importance of input bits. We believe that our model is novel and provides a
foundation for inexact Computing. Building on this, we show that asymmetric
problems allow us to invest resources favoring the important bits -- a feature
that can be leveraged to design efficient inexact algorithms. On the negative
side and in contrast, we can prove that the best inexact algorithms for
symmetric problems are no better than simply reducing the resource investment
uniformly across all bits. Akin to classical theories concerned with space and
time complexity, we believe the ability to classify problems as shown in our
paper will serve as a basis for formally reasoning about the effectiveness of
inexactness in the context of a range of computational problems with energy
being the primary resource.

is fundamentally incorrect because it ignores the coupling between the phase

diffusion that always outweighs the contribution from the$-ve$ diffusion
associated with the dispersion along one of the principal axes of the phase

solutions of these $+ve$ and $-ve$ contributions to the particle diffusion

superiority of the GLM PDF approach over the kinetic approach. In so doing we
have drawn attention to the limitations of the GLM approach which these studies

synaptic connections to be in a balanced regime in which excitation and

First, we compare analytical bounds for the continuous and discrete version of
the PDEs. Whilst traditional $L^2$ norm energy bounds applied to the discrete
PDE do not always predict the physical behaviour of the continuous version of
the equation, more strict elliptic norm bounds correctly bound the behaviour of
the continuous PDE. Having derived consistent bounds, we analyse the
effectiveness of two stabilising techniques: over-integration and split form
variations (conservative, non-conservative and skew-symmetric). Whilst the
former is shown to not alleviate aliasing in general, the latter ensures an
aliasing-free solution if the splitting form of the discrete PDE is consistent
with the continuous equation. The success of split form de-aliasing is
restricted to DG schemes with the summation-by-parts
simultaneous-approximation-term (SBP-SAT) properties (e.g. DG with
Gauss-Lobatto points). Numerical experiments are included to illustrate the

neural networks to rank search results in response to a query. Traditional
learning to rank models employ machine learning techniques over hand-crafted IR
features. By contrast, neural models learn representations of language from raw
text that can bridge the gap between query and document vocabulary. Unlike
classical IR models, these new machine learning based approaches are
data-hungry, requiring large scale training data before they can be deployed.
This tutorial introduces basic concepts and intuitions behind neural IR models,
and places them in the context of traditional retrieval models. We begin by
introducing fundamental concepts of IR and different neural and non-neural
approaches to learning vector representations of text. We then review shallow
neural IR methods that employ pre-trained neural term embeddings without
learning the IR task end-to-end. We introduce deep neural networks next,
discussing popular deep architectures. Finally, we review the current DNN
models for information retrieval. We conclude with a discussion on potential
future directions for neural IR.

quasicrystal formation are quite complicated and rather inconvenient for
particle simulations. So to localize numerically the quasicrystal phase, one
should usually simulate over a wide range of system parameters. We show how to
universally localize the parameters values at which dodecagonal quasicrystal
order may appear for a given particle system. For that purpose, we use a
criterion recently proposed for predicting decagonal quasicrystal formation in
one-component two-length-scale systems. The criterion is based on two
dimensionless effective parameters describing the fluid structure which are
extracted from radial distribution function. The proposed method allows
reducing the time spent for searching the parameters favoring certain solid
structure for a given system. We show that the method works well for
dodecagonal quasicrystals; this results is verified on four systems with
different potentials: Dzugutov potential, oscillating potential which mimics
metal interactions, repulsive shoulder potential describing effective
interaction for core/shell model of colloids and embedded-atom model potential
for aluminum. Our results suggest that mechanism of dodecagonal quasicrystal
formation is universal for both metallic and soft-matter systems and it is
based on competition between interparticle scales.

susceptibility is computed for the model of dipole reorientations in an
asymmetric double well potential and for a trap model with a Gaussian density
of states. For most realizations of the models a hump is found in the
higher-order susceptibilities. In particular, for the asymmetric double well
potential model there are two characteristic temperature regimes showing the
occurence of such a hump as compared to a single characteristic regime in case
of the third-order response. In case of the trap model the results strongly
depend on the variable coupled to the field. As for the third-order response,
the low-frequency limit of the susceptibility plays a crucial role with respect
to the occurence of a hump. The findings are discussed in light of recent
experimental results obtained for supercooled liquids. The differences found

basic and practical state tomographic problems in nuclear magnetic resonance

round-the-clock observations of three surveys. The light curve is characterized
by two nested caustic-crossing features, which is unusual for typical
caustic-crossing perturbations. From the modeling of the light curve, we find
that the anomaly is produced by a binary source passing over a caustic formed
by a binary lens. The result proves the importance of high-cadence and
continuous observations, and the capability of second-generation microlensing
experiments to identify such complex perturbations that are previously unknown.
However, the result also raises the issues of the limitations of current
analysis techniques for understanding lens systems beyond two masses and of
determining the appropriate multiband observing strategy of survey experiments.

the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) as a fiducial concept. We consider
modifications to the baseline PIXIE mission (operating 12 months in distortion

spectral information, we forecast an extended PIXIE mission to detect the
expected average non-relativistic and relativistic thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
distortions at high significance (194$\sigma$ and 11$\sigma$, respectively),
even in the presence of foregrounds. The $\Lambda$CDM Silk damping $\mu$-type
distortion is not detected without additional modifications of the instrument
or external data. Galactic synchrotron radiation is the most problematic source
of contamination in this respect, an issue that could be mitigated by combining
PIXIE data with future ground-based observations at low frequencies ($\nu <
15-30$GHz). Assuming moderate external information on the synchrotron spectrum,
we project an upper limit of $|\mu| < 3.6\times 10^{-7}$ (95\% c.l.), slightly
more than one order of magnitude above the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM signal from
the damping of small-scale primordial fluctuations, but a factor of $\simeq
250$ improvement over the current upper limit from COBE/FIRAS. This limit could
be further reduced to $|\mu| < 9.4\times 10^{-8}$ (95\% c.l.) with more

from our updated radius and mass in our transit fitting analysis, we measure
the eccentricity probability distributions for each transiting planet. Planets
in single-star systems tend to have smaller eccentricities than those in
binaries, although this difference is not significant in our small sample. In
the case of Kepler-42bcd, where the eccentricities are known to be $\simeq$0,
we demonstrate that such systems can serve as powerful tests of M dwarf

galaxies may actually be GCs, complicating estimates of reionization-era galaxy
ultraviolet luminosity functions and constraints on dark matter models. GCs are
likely important reionization sources if $5 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 10$. I also
explore predictions for the fraction of accreted versus in situ GCs in the

find a statistically significant, albeit very weak correlation between Gamma_X

robust evidence for a correlation when considering only those AGN with direct

previous studies which focused on z>0.5 broad-line AGN. We discuss this tension
and conclude that it can be partially accounted for if one adopts a simplified,
power-law X-ray spectral model, combined with L/L_Edd estimates that are based
on the continuum emission and on single-epoch broad line spectroscopy in the
optical regime. We finally highlight the limitations on using Gamma_X as a

offer a unique way to constrain the shape of galactic gravitational potentials.
Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic
scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an
alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND),
and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical
evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a
realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the
present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its
immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom
on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total
luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size
relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our
simulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in
the leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around
the Milky Way that is flattened in the direction of the principal plane of its
satellites. This is the first time that tidal dissolution in MOND has been
tested rigorously at these mass and acceleration scales.

several caveats that could affect these results, including the assumed dust

correcting code in the same phase as the toric code, but requiring only a
2-body Hamiltonian. As a frustrated spin model, it is well outside the
commuting models of topological quantum codes that are typically studied, but
its exact solubility makes it more amenable to analysis of effects arising in
this noncommutative setting than a generic topologically ordered Hamiltonian.
Here we study quantum error correction in the honeycomb model using both
analytic and numerical techniques. We first prove explicit exponential bounds
on the approximate degeneracy, local indistinguishability, and correctability
of the code space. These bounds are tighter than can be achieved using known
general properties of topological phases. Our proofs are specialized to the
honeycomb model, but some of the methods may nonetheless be of broader
interest. Following this, we numerically study noise caused by thermalization
processes in the perturbative regime close to the toric code renormalization
group fixed point. The appearance of non-topological excitations in this
setting has no significant effect on the error correction properties of the
honeycomb model in the regimes we study. Although the behavior of this model is
found to be qualitatively similar to that of the standard toric code in most
regimes, we find numerical evidence of an interesting effect in the
low-temperature, finite-size regime where a preferred lattice direction emerges
and anyon diffusion is geometrically constrained. We expect this effect to
yield an improvement in the scaling of the lifetime with system size as

generally results in changes in the charge density distribution, which reflect
the ability of the bonding pattern in solids to adjust to such external
perturbations. In the ionic limit, such changes are described by the formal
oxidation states (FOS) whereby a single atom type is presumed to absorb the
full burden of the perturbation (change in charge) of the whole compound. In
this picture, when the solar absorber CsSnI3 loses 50 % of its Sn atoms thereby
forming the ordered vacancy compound Cs2SnI6, the Sn is said to change from
Sn2+ to Sn4+. In reality, the charge redistribution is more complex. To
understand the electronic properties of these two groups and to gauge the
trends in s-electron charge on the nucleus, we studied the 113/216 compound
pairs CsSnCl3/Cs2SnCl6; CsSnBr3/Cs2SnBr6, and CsSnI3/Cs2SnI6. We have
calculated the electronic structure of these three compound pairs,
complementing them by CsSnF3/Cs2SnF6 in the hypothetical cubic structure for
completing the chemical trends. These materials were also synthesized by
chemical routes and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy
and K-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. We find that in going from 113 to 216
there is a decrease in the s charge on Sn, in agreement with the FOS picture.
However, at the same time, we observe an increase of the p charge via downshift
of the otherwise unoccupied p level, an effect that tends to replenish much of
the lost s charge. This effect is theoretically explained as a self-regulating
response [H. Raebiger, S. Lany, and A. Zunger, Nature 453, 763 (2008)] whereby
the system re-hybridizes to minimize the effect of the charge perturbation
created by vacancy formation. Our work clarifies the relation between FOS and
charge transfer that can be applied to a wide variety of materials.

Instead, they must assume an open set of probe samples and be able to

address the widespread misconception that thresholding verification-like scores

natural selection as the hill climbing on the surface of mean population
fitness. On the other hand, it is also well known that for many more or less
realistic mathematical models this picture is a sever misrepresentation of what
actually occurs. Therefore, we are faced with two questions. First, it is
important to identify the cases in which adaptive landscape metaphor actually
holds exactly in the models, that is, to identify the conditions under which
system's dynamics coincides with the process of searching for a (local) fitness
maximum. Second, even if the mean fitness is not maximized in the process of
evolution, it is still important to understand the structure of the mean
fitness manifold and see the implications of this structure on the system's
dynamics. Using as a basic model the classical replicator equation, in this
note we attempt to answer these two questions and illustrate our results with
simple well studied systems.

public goods economies using methods of topological analysis. Our first main
result is a very clean characterization of the economy's core (the standard
solution concept in public goods). Specifically, we prove that a point is in
the core iff it is Pareto efficient, individually rational, and the set of
points it dominates is path connected.
  While this structural theorem has a few interesting implications in economic
theory, the main focus of the second part of this paper is on a particular
algorithmic application that demonstrates its utility. Since the 1960s,
economists have looked for an efficient computational process that decides
whether or not a given point is in the core. All known algorithms so far run in
exponential time (except in some artificially restricted settings). By heavily
exploiting our new structure, we propose a new algorithm for testing core
membership whose computational bottleneck is the solution of $O(n)$ convex
optimization problems on the utility function governing the economy. It is
fairly natural to assume that convex optimization should be feasible, as it is
needed even for very basic economic computational tasks such as testing Pareto
efficiency. Nevertheless, even without this assumption, our work implies for
the first time that core membership can be efficiently tested on (e.g.) utility
functions that admit ""nice"" analytic expressions, or that appropriately defined
$\varepsilon$-approximate versions of the problem are tractable (by using
modern black-box $\varepsilon$-approximate convex optimization algorithms).

Bogoliubov-deGennes mean field theory, we study how vortex structures form and
evolve as the magnetic flux is tuned. Each vortex seeds a CDW region whose size
is determined by the energy cost of the competing phase. The vortices form a
lattice whose lattice parameter shrinks with increasing flux. Eventually, their
charge-ordered vortex cores overlap, leading to a field-driven coexistence
phase exhibiting both macroscopic charge order and superconductivity -- a
`supersolid'. Ultimately, superconductivity disappears via a first-order phase
transition into a purely charge ordered state. We construct a phase diagram
containing these multiple ordered states, using $t'$, the next-nearest

Secondly, we define the $\mathcal{L}$-SVD for fourth-order tensors and present
an efficient algorithm, where the tensor case requires a stronger condition for

$\mathcal{L}$-QR decomposition and propose a Householder QR algorithm to avoid
the catastrophic cancellation problem associated with the conventional

phenomenologically viable corners of the string landscape where the effective
low energy theory is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with localized
grand unification. The gaugino mass pattern is that of mirage-mediation. The
magnitudes of various SM Yukawa couplings point to a picture where scalar soft
SUSY breaking terms are related to the geography of fields in the compactified
dimensions. Higgs fields and third generation scalars extend to the bulk and
occur in split multiplets with TeV scale soft masses. First and second
generation scalars, localized at orbifold fixed points or tori with enhanced
symmetry, occur in complete GUT multiplets and have much larger masses. This
picture can be matched onto the parameter space of generalized mirage
mediation. Naturalness considerations, the requirement of the observed
electroweak symmetry breaking pattern, and LHC bounds on m(gluino) together
limit the gravitino mass to the m_{3/2}~ 5-60 TeV range. The mirage unification
scale is bounded from below with the limit depending on the ratio of squark to
gravitino masses. We show that while natural SUSY in this realization may
escape detection even at the high luminosity LHC, the high energy LHC with
\sqrt{s}=33 TeV could unequivocally confirm or exclude this scenario. It should
be possible to detect the expected light higgsinos at the ILC if these are
kinematically accessible, and possibly also discriminate the expected
compression of gaugino masses in the natural mini-landscape picture from the
mass pattern expected in models with gaugino mass unification. The thermal WIMP

present the methodology developed to extract cluster positions, verify their
genuine nature, produce multiband photometry (from NUV to NIR), and derive
their physical properties via spectral energy distribution fitting analyses. We
use the nearby spiral galaxy NGC628 as a test case for demonstrating the impact
that LEGUS will have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of
YSCs and compact stellar associations within their host galaxy. Our analysis of
the cluster luminosity function from the UV to the NIR finds a steepening at
the bright end and at all wavelengths suggesting a dearth of luminous clusters.
The cluster mass function of NGC628 is consistent with a power-law distribution
of slopes $\sim -2$ and a truncation of a few times $10^5$ M$_\odot$. After
their formation YSCs and compact associations follow different evolutionary
paths. YSCs survive for a longer timeframe, confirming their being potentially
bound systems. Associations disappear on time scales comparable to
hierarchically organized star-forming regions, suggesting that they are
expanding systems. We find mass-independent cluster disruption in the inner
region of NGC628, while in the outer part of the galaxy there is little or no
disruption. We observe faster disruption rates for low mass ($\leq$ $10^4$
M$_\odot$) clusters suggesting that a mass-dependent component is necessary to
fully describe the YSC disruption process in NGC628.

only on the frequencies of constant-size induced subgraphs. Classical works by
Lov\'asz show that many interesting quantities have this form, including, for
fixed graphs $H$, the number of $H$-copies (induced or not) in an input graph
$G$, and the number of homomorphisms from $H$ to $G$.
  Using the framework of graph motif parameters, we obtain faster algorithms
for counting subgraph copies of fixed graphs $H$ in host graphs $G$: For graphs
$H$ on $k$ edges, we show how to count subgraph copies of $H$ in time
$k^{O(k)}\cdot n^{0.174k + o(k)}$ by a surprisingly simple algorithm. This
improves upon previously known running times, such as $O(n^{0.91k + c})$ time
for $k$-edge matchings or $O(n^{0.46k + c})$ time for $k$-cycles.
  Furthermore, we prove a general complexity dichotomy for evaluating graph
motif parameters: Given a class $\mathcal C$ of such parameters, we consider
the problem of evaluating $f\in \mathcal C$ on input graphs $G$, parameterized
by the number of induced subgraphs that $f$ depends upon. For every recursively
enumerable class $\mathcal C$, we prove the above problem to be either FPT or
#W[1]-hard, with an explicit dichotomy criterion. This allows us to recover
known dichotomies for counting subgraphs, induced subgraphs, and homomorphisms
in a uniform and simplified way, together with improved lower bounds.
  Finally, we extend graph motif parameters to colored subgraphs and prove a
complexity trichotomy: For vertex-colored graphs $H$ and $G$, where $H$ is from
a fixed class $\mathcal H$, we want to count color-preserving $H$-copies in
$G$. We show that this problem is either polynomial-time solvable or FPT or
#W[1]-hard, and that the FPT cases indeed need FPT time under reasonable
assumptions.

under certain invertibility conditions. As a result, it is proved that a
uniformly distributed input process maximizes the channel's block mutual

in terms of the noise-erasure entropy rate and the entropy rate of an auxiliary
erasure process. The feedback channel capacity is also characterized, showing
that feedback does not increase capacity and generalizing prior related
results. The capacity-cost function of the channel with and without feedback is
also investigated. A sequence of finite-letter upper bounds for the
capacity-cost function without feedback is derived. Finite-letter lower bonds
for the capacity-cost function with feedback are obtained using a specific

it performs no worse than an approach based on code generation. We develop a
heuristic scheme for choosing the optimal parameters for tensor transpose
algorithms by implementing an analytical GPU performance model that can be used
at runtime without need for performance measurements or profiling. Finally, by
integrating cuTT into the tensor algebra library TAL-SH, we significantly
reduce the tensor transpose overhead in tensor contractions, achieving as low

that builds on the prototype pipeline for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.
We have developed a Python-based, flexible framework to inject synthetic
galaxies into real HSC images called SynPipe. Here we explain the design and
implementation of SynPipe and generate a sample of synthetic galaxies to
examine the photometric performance of the HSC pipeline. For stars, we achieve
1% photometric precision at i~19.0 mag and 6% precision at i~25.0 in the

photometry achieves 13% photometric precision at i~20.0 mag and 18% precision

yield unbiased color estimates that are robust to seeing conditions. We
identify several caveats that apply to the version of HSC pipeline used for the
first public HSC data release (DR1) that need to be taking into consideration.
First, the degree to which an object is blended with other objects impacts the
overall photometric performance. This is especially true for point sources.
Highly blended objects tend to have larger photometric uncertainties,
systematically underestimated fluxes and slightly biased colors. Second, >20%
of stars at 22.5< i < 25.0 mag can be misclassified as extended objects. Third,
the current CModel algorithm tends to strongly underestimate the half-light
radius and ellipticity of galaxy with i>21.5 mag.

emerge from a full quantum description when one does not have access to all the
degrees of freedom of a system. More concretely, we describe the properties of

scientific objectives include measuring the role of environment in the
evolution of low-mass galaxies, and measuring the dynamics and stellar contents
of their host haloes. The targets are selected from the SpARCS, SPT, COSMOS and
SXDS surveys, to be the evolutionary counterparts of today's clusters and
groups. The new red-sensitive Hamamatsu detectors on GMOS, coupled with the
nod-and-shuffle sky subtraction, allow simultaneous wavelength coverage over
$\lambda\sim 0.6$--$1.05\mu$m, and this enables a homogeneous and statistically
complete redshift survey of galaxies of all types. The spectroscopic sample
targets galaxies with AB magnitudes $z^{\prime}<24.25$ and [3.6]$\mu$m$<22.5$,
and is therefore statistically complete for stellar masses
$M_\ast\gtrsim10^{10.3}M_\odot$, for all galaxy types and over the entire
redshift range. Deep, multiwavelength imaging has been acquired over larger
fields for most systems, spanning $u$ through $K$, in addition to deep IRAC
imaging at 3.6$\mu$m. The spectroscopy is $\sim 50$ per cent complete as of
semester 17A, and we anticipate a final sample of $\sim 500$ new cluster
members. Combined with existing spectroscopy on the brighter galaxies from
GCLASS, SPT and other sources, GOGREEN will be a large legacy cluster and field
galaxy sample at this redshift that spectroscopically covers a wide range in
stellar mass, halo mass, and clustercentric radius.

been suspected to play an important role in plasmas operating near the
Greenwald density limit $ n_G $. In this study, equilibrium profiles as well as
the turbulent particle flux and Reynolds stress across the separatrix in the
HL-2A tokamak are examined as $ n_G $ is approached in ohmic L-mode discharges.
As the normalized line-averaged density $ \bar{n}_e/n_G $ is raised, the
shearing rate of the mean poloidal flow $ \omega_{\rm sh} $ drops, and the
turbulent drive for the low-frequency zonal flow (the Reynolds power $
\mathcal{P}_{Re} $) collapses. Correspondingly, the turbulent particle
transport increases drastically with increasing collision rates. The geodesic
acoustic modes (GAMs) gain more energy from the ambient turbulence at higher
densities, but have smaller shearing rate than low-frequency zonal flows. The
increased density also introduces decreased adiabaticity which not only
enhances the particle transport but is also related to a reduction in the
eddy-tilting and the Reynolds power. Both effects may lead to the cooling of
edge plasmas and therefore the onset of MHD instabilities that limit the plasma
density.

the length $\ell$ generic $p$-symbol of degree $n+1$ is bounded below by
$n+\ell$ when the base field is algebraically closed of characteristic $p$. The
proof uses new techniques for working with residues in Milne-Kato
$p$-cohomology and builds on work of Babic and Chernousov in the Witt group in
characteristic 2. Two corollaries on $p$-symbol algebras (i.e, degree 2
symbols) result from this work. The generic $p$-symbol algebra of length $\ell$
is shown to have $p$-essential dimension equal to $\ell+1$ as a $p$-torsion
Brauer class. The second is a lower bound of $\ell+1$ on the $p$-essential
dimension of the functor $\mathrm{Alg}_{p^\ell,p}$. Roughly speaking this says
that you will need at least $\ell+1$ independent parameters to be able to
specify any given algebra of degree $p^{\ell}$ and exponent $p$ over a field of

individual ECoG electrodes become precisely synchronized to initiations of the
production of CVSs (i.e., that these initiations occur at precise phases of
bandpassed-filtered voltages recorded at most ECoG electrodes). This
synchronization is not a trivial consequence of the rhythmic production of
CVSs, since it takes several minutes to be fully established and is observed at
the frequency of CVS production and at its second harmonic. The phase of
filtered voltages at which CVSs are produced varies systematically across the
grid of electrodes, consistently with the propagation of traveling waves (TWs).
Using these synchronized phases we isolate a first TW in voltages (filtered at
the median CVS-production frequency) moving from primary auditory to premotor
cortex, and a second TW in high-gamma amplitude (coupled to phase at the
CVS-production frequency) moving along the same path but in opposite direction.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of rhythmic motor acts synchronizing
spatio-temporally organized cortical activity in the human brain.

consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion. Like the
surface state of a conventional topological insulator, the surface Dirac
fermion in this ""nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator"" provides a theoretical
exception to a fermion doubling theorem. Unlike the surface state of a
conventional topological insulator, it can be gapped into topologically
distinct surface regions while keeping time-reversal symmetry, allowing for
networks of topological surface quantum spin Hall domain walls. We report the
theoretical discovery of new topological crystalline phases in the A$_2$B$_3$

  Aldinucci","A Formal Semantics for Data Analytics Pipelines","24 pages",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this report, we present a new programming model based on Pipelines and
Operators, which are the building blocks of programs written in PiCo, a DSL for
Data Analytics Pipelines. In the model we propose, we use the term Pipeline to
denote a workflow that processes data collections -- rather than a
computational process -- as is common in the data processing community. The
novelty with respect to other frameworks is that all PiCo operators are
polymorphic with respect to data types. This makes it possible to 1) re-use the
same algorithms and pipelines on different data models (e.g., streams, lists,
sets, etc); 2) reuse the same operators in different contexts, and 3) update
operators without affecting the calling context, i.e., the previous and
following stages in the pipeline. Notice that in other mainstream frameworks,
such as Spark, the update of a pipeline by changing a transformation with
another is not necessarily trivial, since it may require the development of an
input and output proxy to adapt the new transformation for the calling context.
In the same line, we provide a formal framework (i.e., typing and semantics)
that characterizes programs from the perspective of how they transform the data
structures they process -- rather than the computational processes they
represent. This approach allows to reason about programs at an abstract level,
without taking into account any aspect from the underlying execution model or
implementation.

dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the

at z=10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic
ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology
of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation
can be described by three distinct phases: at z~10-5, galaxy growth in
protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos
that are among the most active regions in the Universe; at z~5-1.5, rapid star
formation occurred within the entire 10-20 Mpc structures, forming most of
their present-day stellar mass; at z<~1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove
these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details
of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results
motivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the
rapid, extended stellar growth during Cosmic Noon, and their connection to
reionization during Cosmic Dawn.

bounds. In the first scenario, the two corner points of the capacity region as
well as the sum rate capacity are established, and it is shown that a
single-letter solution is adequate to achieve both the corner points and the
sum rate capacity. Furthermore, the full capacity region is characterized in
situations in which the sum rate capacity is equal to the capacity of the

relevant in clinical radiotherapy. One method for assessment involves
partitioning delineated regions of interest and comparing the relative
contributions or importance to clinical outcomes. We show that an intuitive
method for dividing organ contours, compound (sub-)segmentation, can
unintentionally lead to sub-segments with inconsistent volumes, which will bias
relative importance assessment. An improved technique, nested segmentation, is
introduced and compared. Methods: Clinical radiotherapy planning parotid
contours from 510 patients were segmented. Counts of radiotherapy dose matrix
voxels interior to sub-segments were used to determine the equivalency of
sub-segment volumes. The distribution of voxel counts within sub-segments were
compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and characterized by their dispersion.
Analytical solutions for 2D/3D analogues were derived and sub-segment
area/volume were compared directly. Results: Both parotid and 2D/3D region of
interest analogue segmentation confirmed compound segmentation intrinsically
produces sub-segments with volumes that depend on the region of interest shape
and selection location. Significant volume differences were observed when
sub-segmenting parotid contours into 18ths, and vanishingly small sub-segments
were observed when sub-segmenting into 96ths. Central sub-segments were
considerably smaller than sub-segments on the periphery. Nested segmentation
did not exhibit these shortcomings and produced sub-segments with equivalent
volumes when dose grid and contour collinearity was addressed, even when
dividing the parotid into 96ths. Nested segmentation was always faster or
equivalent in runtime to compound segmentation. Conclusions: Nested
segmentation is more suited than compound segmentation for analyses requiring
equal weighting of sub-segments.

subadditive combinatorial auctions. This problem was originally introduced by
Dobzinski, Nisan, and Oren (STOC'14) as the following simple market scenario:
$m$ items are to be allocated among $n$ bidders in a distributed setting where
bidders valuations are private and hence communication is needed to obtain an
efficient allocation. The communication happens in rounds: in each round, each
bidder, simultaneously with others, broadcasts a message to all parties
involved and the central planner computes an allocation solely based on the
communicated messages. Dobzinski et.al. showed that no non-interactive
($1$-round) protocol with polynomial communication (in the number of items and
bidders) can achieve approximation ratio better than $\Omega(m^{{1}/{4}})$,
while for any $r \geq 1$, there exists $r$-round protocols that achieve
$\widetilde{O}(r \cdot m^{{1}/{r+1}})$ approximation with polynomial
communication; in particular, $O(\log{m})$ rounds of interaction suffice to
obtain an (almost) efficient allocation.
  A natural question at this point is to identify the ""right"" level of
interaction (i.e., number of rounds) necessary to obtain an efficient
allocation. In this paper, we resolve this question by providing an almost
tight round-approximation tradeoff for this problem: we show that for any $r
\geq 1$, any $r$-round protocol that uses polynomial communication can only
approximate the social welfare up to a factor of $\Omega(\frac{1}{r} \cdot
m^{{1}/{2r+1}})$. This in particular implies that
$\Omega(\frac{\log{m}}{\log\log{m}})$ rounds of interaction are necessary for
obtaining any efficient allocation in these markets. Our work builds on the
recent multi-party round-elimination technique of Alon, Nisan, Raz, and
Weinstein (FOCS'15) and settles an open question posed by Dobzinski et.al. and
Alon et. al.

probe non-centrosymmetric environments in aqueous media, from bulk solutions to
interfaces, living cells and tissue. A central assumption made in analyzing SHS
experiments is that the each molecule scatters light according to a constant
molecular hyperpolarizability tensor $\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(2)}$. Here, we
investigate the dependence of the molecular hyperpolarizability of water on its
environment and internal geometric distortions, in order to test the hypothesis
of constant $\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(2)}$. We use quantum chemistry calculations
of the hyperpolarizability of a molecule embedded in point-charge environments
obtained from simulations of bulk water. We demonstrate that both the
heterogeneity of the solvent configurations and the quantum mechanical
fluctuations of the molecular geometry introduce large variations in the
non-linear optical response of water. This finding has the potential to change
the way SHS experiments are interpreted: in particular, isotopic differences
between H$_2$O and D$_2$O could explain recent second-harmonic scattering
observations. Finally, we show that a simple machine-learning framework can
predict accurately the fluctuations of the molecular hyperpolarizability. This
model accounts for the microscopic inhomogeneity of the solvent and represents
a first step towards quantitative modelling of SHS experiments.

the confining phase. Chiral vortical effect (CVE) is the flow of axial current
along the axis of rotation of the fluid while the spin alignment is a
non-vanishing correlation of polarizations of baryons with the axis of
rotation. As the theoretical framework we use the model of pionic superfluidity
induced by a non-vanishing isotopic chemical potential. We note that the
average value of spin of virtual baryons reproduces the CVE. The role of
defects, or vortices is crucial. The model does not apply directly to the
quark-gluon plasma but might indicate existence of a mechanism to produce
baryons with relatively large polarization in heavy-ion collisions.

also inferring a canonical tag dictionary and part hierarchy. We then use this

emission at the metre wavelength. They are believed to be excited by
non-thermal energetic electrons accelerated in the corona. The underlying
dynamic process and exact emission mechanism still remain unresolved. Here,
with a combined analysis of extreme ultraviolet (EUV), radio and photospheric
magnetic field data of unprecedented quality recorded during a type-I storm on
30 July 2011, we identify a good correlation between the radio bursts and the
co-spatial EUV and magnetic activities. The EUV activities manifest themselves
as three major brightening stripes above a region adjacent to a compact
sunspot, while the magnetic field there presents multiple moving magnetic
features (MMFs) with persistent coalescence or cancelation and a
morphologically similar three-part distribution. We find that the type-I
intensities are correlated with those of the EUV emissions at various
wavelengths with a correlation coefficient of 0.7-0.8. In addition, in the
region between the brightening EUV stripes and the radio sources there appear
consistent dynamic motions with a series of bi-directional flows, suggesting
ongoing small-scale reconnection there. Mainly based on the induced connection
between the magnetic motion at the photosphere and the EUV and radio activities
in the corona, we suggest that the observed type-I noise storms and the EUV
brightening activities are the consequence of small-scale magnetic reconnection
driven by MMFs. This is in support of the original proposal made by Bentely et
al. (Solar Phys. 193, 227, 2000).

years. However, this is unlikely, as our model suggests strong deceleration to
speeds < 0.5c within months and a much smaller, sub-parsec size. In this
interpretation, the northwest component could have either a non-nuclear origin

roles in historical major cascading outages and blackouts. Therefore, in the
simulation and risk assessment of cascading outages in power systems, it is
necessary to consider the weather and environmental effects. This paper
proposes a method for the risk assessment of weather-related cascading outages.
Based on the analysis of historical outage records and temperature-dependent
physical outage mechanisms of transmission lines, an outage rate model
considering weather condition and conductor temperature is proposed, and the
analytical form of outage probability of lines are derived. With the
weather-dependent outage model, a two-stage risk assessment method based on
Markovian tree (MT) search is proposed, which consists of offline full
assessment, and online efficient update of risk assessment results and
continued MT search using updated NWP data. The test cases on NPCC 140-bus test

proposed risk assessment method in both accuracy and efficiency.

alternative approximation in a time- and memory- efficient manner which is
denoted as Semi-Global Weighed Least Squares (SG-WLS). Instead of solving a
large linear system, we propose to iteratively solve a sequence of subsystems
which are one-dimensional WLS models. Although each subsystem is
one-dimensional, it can take two-dimensional neighborhood information into
account due to the proposed special neighborhood construction. We show such a
desirable property makes our SG-WLS achieve close performance to the original
two-dimensional WLS model but with much less time and memory cost. While
previous related methods mainly focus on the 4-connected/8-connected
neighborhood system, our SG-WLS can handle a more general and larger
neighborhood system thanks to the proposed fast solution. We show such a
generalization can achieve better performance than the 4-connected/8-connected
neighborhood system in some applications. Our SG-WLS is $\sim20$ times faster
than the WLS model. For an image of $M\times N$, the memory cost of SG-WLS is
at most at the magnitude of $max\{\frac{1}{M}, \frac{1}{N}\}$ of that of the
WLS model. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of our SG-WLS in a range of
applications. The code is publicly available at:

inference in observational studies has led to a proliferation of different
estimating strategies, most of which involve first fitting non-parametric

reporting plug-in estimates for the effect of interest. In applications,
however, it is often difficult to tune the non-parametric regressions in a way

uses numerical convex optimization to directly obtain the finite-sample-minimax

on the second derivative of the conditional response function. Given a bound on
the second derivative, our proposed method is fully data-driven, and provides
uniform confidence intervals for the regression discontinuity parameter with

Orbital optimization, which is generally necessary to obtain reliable results,

for applications on linear polyacenes, which are believed to exhibit strong
correlation in the {\pi} space. While local minima and {\sigma}-{\pi} symmetry
breaking solutions were found for PP orbitals, no such problems were
encountered for PQ orbitals. The PQ orbitals are used for single-point
calculations at PP, PQ and perfect hextuples (PH) levels of theory, both only
in the {\pi} subspace, as well as in the full {\sigma}{\pi} valence space. It
is numerically demonstrated that the inclusion of single excitations is
necessary also when optimized orbitals are used. PH is found to yield good
agreement with previously published density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
data in the {\pi} space, capturing over 95% of the correlation energy.
Full-valence calculations made possible by our novel, efficient code reveal
that strong correlations are weaker when larger bases or active spaces are
employed than in previous calculations. The largest full-valence PH
calculations presented correspond to a (192e,192o) problem.

Poiseuille flow in the presence of bulk-insoluble surfactants is studied
analytically. Assuming the convective transport of fluid and heat to be
negligible, we perform a small-deformation perturbation analysis to obtain the
droplet migration velocity. The droplet dynamics strongly depends on the
distribution of surfactants along the droplet interface, which is governed by
the relative strength of convective transport of surfactants as compared with
the diffusive transport of surfactants. The present study is focused on the
following two limits: (i) when the surfactant transport is dominated by surface
diffusion, and (ii) when the surfactant transport is dominated by surface
convection. In the first limiting case, it is seen that the axial velocity of
the droplet decreases with increase in the advection of the surfactants along
the surface. The variation of cross-stream migration velocity, on the other
hand, is analyzed over three different regimes based on the ratio of the
viscosity of the droplet phase to that of the carrier phase. In the first
regime the migration velocity decreases with increase in surface advection of
the surfactants although there is no change in direction of droplet migration.
For the second regime, the direction of the cross-stream migration of the
droplet changes depending on different parameters. In the third regime, the
migration velocity is merely affected by any change in the surfactant
distribution. For the other limit of higher surface advection in comparison to
surface diffusion of the surfactants, the axial velocity of the droplet is
found to be independent of the surfactant distribution. However, the
cross-stream velocity is found to decrease with increase in non-uniformity in
surfactant distribution.

theoretical results. In this work, we introduce methods, based on degree
preserving rewiring, that can be used to tune the clustering and
degree-correlations in directed networks with random and scale-free topologies.
They provide null-models to investigate the role of the mentioned properties
along with their strengths and limitations. We find that in the case of
clustering, structural relationships, that are independent of topology and
rewiring schemes are revealed, while in the case of degree-correlations, the
network topology is found to play an important role in the working of the
mechanisms. We also study the effects of link-density on the efficiency of
these rewiring mechanisms and find that in the case of clustering, the topology
of the network plays an important role in determining how link-density affects
the rewiring process, while in the case of degree-correlations, the
link-density and topology, play no role for sufficiently large number of

data analysis (TDA), we introduce and study homotopy interleavings between
filtered topological spaces. These are homotopy-invariant analogues of
interleavings, objects commonly used in TDA to articulate stability and
inference theorems. Intuitively, whereas a strict interleaving between filtered
spaces $X$ and $Y$ certifies that $X$ and $Y$ are approximately isomorphic, a
homotopy interleaving between $X$ and $Y$ certifies that $X$ and $Y$ are
approximately weakly equivalent. The main results of this paper are that
homotopy interleavings induce an extended pseudometric $d_{HI}$ on filtered
spaces, and that this is the universal pseudometric satisfying natural
stability and homotopy invariance axioms. To motivate these axioms, we also
observe that $d_{HI}$ (or more generally, any pseudometric satisfying these two
axioms and an additional ""homology bounding"" axiom) can be used to formulate
lifts of several fundamental TDA theorems from the algebraic (homological)
level to the level of filtered spaces. Finally, we consider the problem of
establishing a persistent Whitehead theorem in terms of homotopy interleavings.
We provide a counterexample to a naive formulation of the result.

descriptions of granular media, with an entropy accounting for all force
configurations at mechanical equilibrium consistent with some external stress.
It is possible to define a temperature-like parameter, the angoricity
{\alpha}^{-1}, which under isotropic compression is a scalar variable. This
ensemble is frequently studied on whole packings of grains; however, previous
works have shown that spatial correlations can be neglected in many cases,
opening the door to studies on a single grain. Our work develops a Monte Carlo
method to sample the force ensemble on a single grain at constant angoricity on
two and three-dimensional mono-disperse granular systems, both with or without
static friction. The results show that, despite the steric exclusions and the
constrictions of Coulomb's limit and repulsive normal forces, the pressure per
grain always show a gamma distribution with scale parameter {\nu} =
{\alpha}^{-1} and shape parameter k close to k', the number of degrees of
freedom in the system. Moreover, the average pressure per grain fulfills an
equipartition theorem <p>=k'{\alpha}^{-1} in all cases (in close parallelism
with the one for an ideal gas). These results suggest the existence of k'
independent random variables (i.e. elementary forces) with identical
exponential distributions as the basic elements for describing the force
network ensemble at low angoricities under isotropic compression, in analogy
with the volume ensemble of granular materials.

necessitated a variety of user and base station (BS) configurations to be
considered for realistic performance evaluation and system design. This is
directly reflected in the HetNet simulation models proposed by standardization
bodies, such as the third generation partnership project (3GPP). Complementary
to these simulation models, stochastic geometry-based approach, modeling the
locations of the users and the K tiers of BSs as independent and homogeneous
Poisson point processes (PPPs), has gained prominence in the past few years.
Despite its success in revealing useful insights, this PPP-based K-tier HetNet
model is not rich enough to capture spatial coupling between user and BS
locations that exists in real-world HetNet deployments and is included in 3GPP
simulation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that modeling a fraction of
users and arbitrary number of BS tiers alternatively with a Poisson cluster
process (PCP) captures the aforementioned coupling, thus bridging the gap
between the 3GPP simulation models and the PPP-based analytic model for
HetNets. We further show that the downlink coverage probability of a typical
user under maximum signal-to-interference-ratio association can be expressed in
terms of the sum-product functionals over PPP, PCP, and its associated
offspring point process, which are all characterized as a part of our analysis.
We also show that the proposed model converges to the PPP-based HetNet model as
the cluster size of the PCPs tends to infinity. Finally, we specialize our
analysis based on general PCPs for Thomas and Matern cluster processes. Special
instances of the proposed model closely resemble the different configurations
for BS and user locations considered in 3GPP simulations.

truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) and find that system relaxes to a steady

time evolution of expectation values of observables and their long-time limits.
We find that the deviation of the long-time expectation value from its

selects the final solution corresponding with a vector that has the MMD from a
normalized ideal vector. This procedure is equivalent to the knee selection
described by a divide and conquer approach that involves iterations of pairwise
comparisons. Being able to systematically assign weighting coefficients to
multiple criteria, the MMD approach is equivalent to a weighted-sum (WS)
approach. Because of the equivalence, the MMD approach possesses rich geometric
interpretations that are considered essential in the field of evolutionary
computation. The MMD approach is elegant because all evaluations can be
performed by efficient matrix calculations without iterations of comparisons.
While the WS approach may encounter an indeterminate situation in which a few
solutions yield almost the same WS, the MMD approach is able to determine the
final solution discriminately. Since existing multiobjective evolutionary
algorithms aim for a posteriori decision making, i.e., determining the final
solution after a set of Pareto optimal solutions is available, the proposed MMD
approach can be combined with them to form a powerful solution method of
solving MOPs. Furthermore, the approach enables scalable definitions of the

position in the micro channel can be attained by the droplet depending on the
applied temperature gradient in the cross-stream direction or how small the
droplet is with respect to the channel width. For the analytical solution, an
asymptotic approach is used, where we neglect any effect of inertia or thermal
convection of the fluid in either of the phases. To obtain a numerical
solution, we use the conservative level set method. Variation of temperature in
the flow field causes a jump in the tangential component of stress at the
droplet interface. This jump in stress component, which is the thermal
Marangoni stress, is an important factor that controls the trajectory of the
droplet. The direction of cross-stream migration of the droplet is decided by
the magnitude of the critical Marangoni stress, corresponding to which the
droplet remains stationary. In order to analyze practical microfluidic setup,
we do numerical simulations where we consider wall effects as well as the

composed of a quark matter core in general relativity, assuming that the
deconfined quark matter exists in a crystalline color superconducting phase. We
find that taking the elastic property of crystalline quark matter into account
in the calculation of the tidal deformability can break the universal I-Love
relation discovered for fluid compact stars, which connects the moment of
inertia and tidal deformability. Our result suggests that measurements of the
moment of inertia and tidal deformability can in principle be used to test the
existence of solid quark stars, despite our ignorance of the high density
equation of state (EOS). Assuming that the moment of inertia can be measured to
10% level, one can then distinguish a 1.4 (1) $M_\odot$ solid quark star
described by our quark matter EOS model with a gap parameter $\Delta=25$ MeV
from a fluid compact star if the tidal deformability can be measured to about
10% (45%) level. On the other hand, we find that the nuclear matter fluid
envelope of a hybrid star can screen out the effect of the solid core
significantly so that the resulting I-Love relation for hybrid stars still
agrees with the universal relation for fluid stars to about 1% level.

formulated in terms of the delta operator. The proposed multi-agent system can
unify discrete-time and continuous-time multi-agent systems. In a multi-agent
network, in practice, the communication among agents is acted upon by various
factors. The communication network among faulty agents may cause link failures,
which is modeled by randomly switching graphs. First, we show that the delta
representation of discrete-time multi-agent system reaches consensus in mean
(in probability and almost surely) if the expected graph is strongly connected.
The results induce that the continuous-time multi-agent system with random
networks can also reach consensus in the same sense. Second, the influence of
faulty agents on consensus value is quantified under original network. By using
matrix perturbation theory, the error bound is also presented in this paper.
Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our theoretical results.

chaos propagation in a local system. Compared to the Lieb-Robinson velocity
that bounds the propagation speed of all perturbations, the butterfly velocity,
studied in thermal ensembles, is an ""effective"" Lieb-Robinson velocity for a
subspace of the Hilbert space defined by the microcanonical ensemble. In this
paper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case
to a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider
the code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.
Using local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation
between the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk
causal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the
bulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given
Lieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light
cone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the
butterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the
local reconstructions of bulk local operators. If the bulk geometry satisfies
Einstein equation and the null energy condition, for rotation symmetric
geometries we prove that infrared operators always have a slower butterfly
velocity that the ultraviolet one. For asymptotic AdS geometries, this also
implies that the butterfly velocities of all operators are upper bounded by the
speed of light. We further prove that the butterfly velocity is equal to the
speed of light if the causal wedge of the boundary region coincides with its
entanglement wedge. Finally, we discuss the implication of our result to
geometries that are not asymptotically AdS, and in particular, obtain
constraints that must be satisfied by a dual theory of flat space gravity.

comparison of solo publications with joint publications. In this paper, like
\cite{price1981multiple}, we argue for an egalitarian perspective in
accomplishing this task.
  More specifically, we justify the need for an ethical perspective in
quantifying academic author by identifying certain ethical difficulties of some
popular contemporary indices used for this purpose. And then we show that for
any given dataset of research papers, the unique method satisfying the ethical
notions of {\it identity independence} and performance invariance must be the
egaliatarian E-index proposed by \cite{bps} and \cite{price1981multiple}. In
our setting, this egalitarian method divides authorship of joint projects
equally among authors and sums across all publications of each author.

disorder-tuned across the SIT by adjusting thickness and film stoichiometry;
insulating films exhibit classical hopping transport. Superconducting films
exhibit a magnetic field-tuned SIT, whose insulating ground state at high field
appears to be a quantum-corrected metal. Scaling behavior at the field-tuned
SIT shows classical percolation critical exponents $z \nu \approx$ 1.3, with a
corresponding critical field $H_c \ll H_{c2}$. The Hall effect shows a crossing
point near $H_c$, but with a non-universal critical value $\rho_{xy}^c$
comparable to the normal state Hall resistivity. We propose that high-carrier
density metals will always exhibit this pattern of behavior at the boundary
between superconducting and (trivially) insulating ground states.

communication systems taking into account the following impairments:
signal-dependent diffusion noise, inter-symbol interference (ISI), and external
interfering molecules. The receiver counts the number of observed molecules
several times within one symbol interval and employs linear filtering to detect
the transmitted data. We derive the optimal matched filter by maximizing the
expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the decision variable.
Moreover, we show that for the special case of an ISI-free channel, the matched
filter reduces to a simple sum detector and a correlator for the channel
impulse response for the diffusion noise-limited and (external)
interference-limited regimes, respectively. Our simulation results reveal that
the proposed matched filter considerably outperforms the benchmark schemes

learn a model for directly comparing image features and class names. However,
this proves to be a difficult task due to dominance of non-visual semantics in
underlying vector-space embeddings of class names. To address this issue, we
discriminatively learn a word representation such that the similarities between
class and combination of attribute names fall in line with the visual
similarity. Contrary to the traditional zero-shot learning approaches that are
built upon attribute presence, our approach bypasses the laborious
attribute-class relation annotations for unseen classes. In addition, our
proposed approach renders text-only training possible, hence, the training can
be augmented without the need to collect additional image data. The
experimental results show that our method yields state-of-the-art results for
unsupervised ZSL in three benchmark datasets.

geometrical extension and retraction of nanomaterials has a wide variety of
potential applications, including for mimicking biomotors. Here, using
molecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that there exists an intrinsic
energy conversion mechanism between thermal energy and mechanical work in the
telescopic motions of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A DWCNT can
inherently convert heat into mechanical work in its telescopic extension
process, while convert mechanical energy into heat in its telescopic retraction
process. These two processes are thermodynamically reversible. The underlying
mechanism for this reversibility is that the entropy changes with the
telescopic overlapping length of concentric individual tubes. We find also that
the entropy effect enlarges with the decreasing intertube space of DWCNTs. As a
result, the spontaneously telescopic motion of a condensed DWCNT can be
switched to extrusion by rising the system temperature above a critical value.
These findings are important for fundamentally understanding the mechanical
behavior of concentric nanotubes, and may have general implications in the
application of DWCNTs as linear motors in nanodevices.

Satterthwaite regarding voting with ordinal rules, there has been recent
interest in characterizing how well common voting rules approximate the social
optimum. In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to
consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space,
and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as
compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to
explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a
population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so,
then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the
metric space?
  We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice
setting: a population of voters, two independently drawn candidates, and a
majority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the
population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be
thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one. We examine how
this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population
of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio
improves from $3$ to $4-2\sqrt{2}$, roughly $1.1716$; this bound is tight. When
the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of $1.5$ and a constant upper
bound strictly better than $2$ on the approximation ratio of the majority rule.
  The positive result depends in part on the assumption that candidates are
independent and identically distributed. However, we show that independence
alone is not enough to achieve the upper bound: even when candidates are drawn
independently, if the population of candidates can be different from the
voters, then an upper bound of $2$ on the approximation is tight.

Cartesian coordinates allowing for the modeling of rectangular geometries in
open space. The open boundary condition is a consequence of having an infinite
computational domain described using basis functions that expand the whole
space. The strength of the method lies in discretizing the Fourier integrals
using a non-uniform circular ""dartboard"" sampling of the Fourier $k$ space. We
show that our sampling technique leads to a more accurate description of the
continuum of the radiation modes that leak out from the structure. We also
compare our approach to conventional discretization with direct and inverse

apply our method to a variety of optical waveguide structures and demonstrate
that the method leads to a significantly improved convergence enabling more

deformations in carbon nanotubes on their electronic transport properties. To
this end we perform numerical ab-initio calculations using a
density-functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) model for various tubes with
vacancies. The geometry optimization leads to a change of the atomic positions.
There is a strong reconstruction of the atoms near the defect (called
""distortion"") and there is an additional long-range deformation. The impact of
both structural features on the conductance is systematically investigated. We
compare short and long CNTs of different kinds with and without long-range
deformation. We find for the very thin (9,0)-CNT that the long-range
deformation additionally affects the transmission spectrum and the conductance
compared to the short-range lattice distortion. The conductance of the larger
(11,0)- or the (14,0)-CNT is overall less affected implying that the influence
of the long-range deformation decreases with increasing tube diameter.
Furthermore, the effect can be either positive or negative depending on the CNT
type and the defect type. Our results indicate that the long-range deformation
must be included in order to reliably describe the electronic structure of
defective, small-diameter zigzag tubes.

evolution is a long-standing, open problem of many-body physics. The eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH) postulates that thermalization happens at the
level of individual eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian. However, the ETH
requires stringent conditions to be validated, and it does not address how the
thermal state is reached dynamically from an inital non-equilibrium state. We
consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped in a double-well potential
with an initial population imbalance. We find that the system thermalizes
although the initial conditions violate the ETH requirements. We identify three
dynamical regimes. After an initial regime of undamped Josephson oscillations,
the subsystem of incoherent excitations or quasiparticles (QP) becomes strongly
coupled to the BEC subsystem by means of a dynamically generated, parametric
resonance. When the energy stored in the QP system reaches its maximum, the
number of QPs becomes effectively constant, and the system enters a
quasi-hydrodynamic regime where the two subsystems are weakly coupled. In this
final regime the BEC acts as a grand-canonical heat reservoir for the QP system
(and vice versa), resulting in thermalization. We term this mechanism dynamical
bath generation (DBG).

which are all realized as loosely confined states with a divergent norm.
Asymptotic tails of the solutions, which determine the divergence of the norm,
are constructed in a universal analytical form by means of the Thomas-Fermi
approximation (TFA). Global approximations for the LCWs, LDSs, and LDVs are
constructed on the basis of interpolations between analytical approximations
available far from (TFA) and close to the center. In particular, the
interpolations for the 1D LDS, as well as for the 2D LDVs, are based on a
\textquotedblleft deformed-tanh"" expression, which is suggested by the usual 1D
dark-soliton solution. In addition to the 1D fundamental LDSs with the single
notch, and 2D vortices with $S=1$, higher-order LDSs with multiple notches are
found too, as well as double LDVs, with $S=2$. Stability regions for the modes
under the consideration are identified by means of systematic simulations, the
LCWs being completely stable in 1D and 2D, as they are ground states in the

outburst in scientific papers on the topic, a comprehensive comparative study

that this target buffer level is a critical classifier for the studied HAS

is a recurring theme in many biological and engineering applications. Inspired
by the motor-driven movement of soft membrane-bound vesicles into closed
neuronal dendritic spines, here we study this problem using a combination of
passive three-dimensional simulations and a simplified semi-analytical theory
for active transport of vesicles that are forced through such constrictions by
molecular motors. We show that the motion of these objects is characterized by
two dimensionless quantities related to the geometry and the strength of
forcing relative to the vesicle elasticity. We use numerical simulations to
characterize the transit time for a vesicle forced by fluid pressure through a
constriction in a channel, and find that relative to an open channel, transport
into a blind end leads to the formation of an effective lubrication layer that
strongly impedes motion. When the fluid pressure forcing is complemented by
forces due to molecular motors that are responsible for vesicle trafficking
into dendritic spines, we find that the competition between motor forcing and
fluid drag results in multistable dynamics reminiscent of the real system. Our
study highlights the role of non-local hydrodynamic effects in determining the
kinetics of vesicular transport in constricted geometries.

diverse emerging applications calls for a wireless communication system that
can support stringent reliability and latency requirements. Both reliability
and energy efficiency are critical for many of these applications that involve
communication with short packets which undermine the coding gain achievable
from large packets. In this paper, we study a cross-layer approach to optimize
the performance of low-power wireless links. At first, we derive a simple and
accurate packet error rate (PER) expression for uncoded schemes in block fading
channels based on a new proposition that shows that the waterfall threshold in
the PER upper bound in Nakagami-m fading channels is tightly approximated by
the m-th moment of an asymptotic distribution of PER in AWGN channel. The
proposed PER approximation establishes an explicit connection between the
physical and link layers parameters, and the packet error rate. We exploit this
connection for cross-layer design and optimization of communication links. To
this end, we propose a semi-analytic framework to jointly optimize
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and modulation order at physical layer, and the
packet length and number of retransmissions at link layer with respect to
distance under the prescribed delay and reliability constraints.

is critical to understand how clouds interact with their environments during
their formation, growth, and collapse. It has been suggested that
accretion-driven turbulence can maintain clouds in a highly turbulent state,
preventing runaway collapse, and explaining the observed non-thermal velocity
dispersions. We present 3D, AMR, MHD simulations of a kiloparsec-scale,
stratified, supernova-driven, self-gravitating, interstellar medium, including
diffuse heating and radiative cooling. These simulations model the formation
and evolution of a molecular cloud population in the turbulent interstellar
medium. We use zoom-in techniques to focus on the dynamics of the mass
accretion and its history for individual molecular clouds. We find that mass
accretion onto molecular clouds proceeds as a combination of turbulent and near
free-fall accretion of a gravitationally bound envelope. Nearby supernova
explosions have a dual role, compressing the envelope, boosting accreted mass,
but also disrupting parts of the envelope and eroding mass from the cloud's
surface. It appears that the inflow rate of kinetic energy onto clouds from
supernova explosions is insufficient to explain the net rate of charge of the
cloud kinetic energy. In the absence of self-consistent star formation,
conversion of gravitational potential into kinetic energy during contraction
seems to be the main driver of non-thermal motions within clouds. We conclude
that although clouds interact strongly with their environments, bound clouds
are always in a state of gravitational contraction, close to runaway, and their
properties are a natural result of this collapse.

radio arcs characterized by a steep spectrum. The origin of these radio sources
is still unclear. Due to their mirror symmetry toward the center, it has been
proposed that they may be created by pairs of precessing jets powered by the
inner AGN. The new JVLA observations were requested with the specific aim of
detecting extended emission on frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz, in order to
constrain the jet-precession model by analyzing the spectral index and
radiative age patterns alongs the arcs. We performed a standard data reduction
of the JVLA datasets with the software CASA. By combining the new 3 GHz data
with the archival 1.4 GHz VLA dataset we produced a spectral index maps of the
extended emission, and then we estimated the radiative age of the arcs by
assuming that the plasma was accelerated in moving hot-spots tracing the arcs.
Thanks to the high sensitivity of the JVLA, we achieve the detection of the
arcs at 3 GHz and extended emission at 5.5 GHz. We measure a mean spectral
index <-2.5 for the arcs up to 3 GHz. No clear spectral index, or radiative
age, trend is detected across the arcs which may challenge the interpretation
based on precession or put strong constraints on the jet-precession period. In
particular, by analyzing the radiative age distribution along the arcs, we were
able to provide for the first time a time-scale < 26 Myr of the jet-precession

assess separability and full symmetry from spatio-temporal observations. In
this work, we propose a functional data analysis approach that constructs test

properties of separability or symmetry for the given spatial pairs. We use
functional boxplots to visualize the functional median and the variability of
the test functions, where the extent of departure from zero at all temporal
lags indicates the degree of non-separability or asymmetry. We also develop a
rank-based nonparametric testing procedure for assessing the significance of
the non-separability or asymmetry. The performances of the proposed methods are

allow a census of Si-bearing molecules in L1157-B1. We detect SiO and its
isotopologues and, for the first time in a shock, SiS. The strong gradient of
the [SiO/SiS] abundance ratio across the shock (from >=180 to ~25) points to a
different chemical origin of the two species. SiO peaks where the jet impacts
the cavity walls ([SiO/H2] ~ 1e-6), indicating that SiO is directly released
from grains or rapidly formed from released Si in the strong shock occurring at
this location. In contrast, SiS is only detected at the head of the cavity
opened by previous ejection events ([SiS/H2] ~ 2e-8). This suggests that SiS is
not directly released from the grain cores but instead should be formed through
slow gas-phase processes using part of the released silicon. This finding shows
that Si-bearing molecules can be useful to distinguish regions where grains or
gas-phase chemistry dominates.

single linear constraint and bounds on the variables. Inspired by the GPCG
algorithm for bound-constrained convex quadratic programming [J.J. Mor\'e and
G. Toraldo, SIAM J. Optim. 1, 1991], our approach alternates between two phases
until convergence: an identification phase, which performs gradient projection
iterations until either a candidate active set is identified or no reasonable
progress is made, and an unconstrained minimization phase, which reduces the
objective function in a suitable space defined by the identification phase, by
applying either the conjugate gradient method or a recently proposed spectral
gradient method. However, the algorithm differs from GPCG not only because it
deals with a more general class of problems, but mainly for the way it stops
the minimization phase. This is based on a comparison between a measure of
optimality in the reduced space and a measure of bindingness of the variables
that are on the bounds, defined by extending the concept of proportioning,
which was proposed by some authors for box-constrained problems. If the
objective function is bounded, the algorithm converges to a stationary point
thanks to a suitable application of the gradient projection method in the
identification phase. For strictly convex problems, the algorithm converges to
the optimal solution in a finite number of steps even in case of degeneracy.
Extensive numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

readily hydrogenated, raising the possibility that hydrogenated fullerenes (or
fulleranes, C$_{60}$H$_m$, $m=1-60$) may be abundant in space. In this paper,
we present theoretical studies of the vibrational modes of isomers of
C$_{60}$H$_m$. Our results show that the four mid-infrared bands from the
C$_{60}$ skeletal vibrations remain prominent in slightly hydrogenated
C$_{60}$, but their strengths diminish in different degrees with increasing
hydrogenation. It is therefore possible that the observed infrared bands
assigned to C$_{60}$ could be due to a mixture of fullerenes and fulleranes.
This provides a potential explanation for the observed scatter of the C$_{60}$

important for their chemical evolution. Their temperature distribution is
determined by the optical properties of the dust grains, which, among other
parameters, depend on their radius. However, in most disk studies, only average
optical properties and thus an average temperature is assumed to account for an
ensemble of grains with different radii. We investigate the impact of
subdividing the grain radius distribution into multiple sub-intervals on the
resulting dust temperature distribution and spectral energy distribution (SED).
These quantities were computed for two different scenarios: (1) Radius
distribution represented by 16 logarithmically distributed radius intervals,
and (2) radius distribution represented by a single grain species with averaged
optical properties (reference). Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of
grain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a
parameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: In
optically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ~63% and
the relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the
reference disk. With increasing optical depth, the difference in the midplane
temperature and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature
decreases. Furthermore, below ~20K, this fraction is higher for the reference
disk than for the case of multiple grain radii, while it shows the opposite
behavior for temperatures above this threshold. The thermal emission in the
case of multiple grain radii at short wavelengths is stronger than for the
reference disk. The freeze-out radius is a function of grain radius, spanning a
radial range between the coldest and warmest grain species of ~30AU.

processing tool in various contexts. However, its computational cost could be
prohibitively high as the data size and the cluster number are large. It is
well known that the processing bottleneck of k-means lies in the operation of
seeking closest centroid in each iteration. In this paper, a novel solution
towards the scalability issue of k-means is presented. In the proposal, k-means
is supported by an approximate k-nearest neighbors graph. In the k-means
iteration, each data sample is only compared to clusters that its nearest
neighbors reside. Since the number of nearest neighbors we consider is much
less than k, the processing cost in this step becomes minor and irrelevant to
k. The processing bottleneck is therefore overcome. The most interesting thing
is that k-nearest neighbor graph is constructed by iteratively calling the fast
$k$-means itself. Comparing with existing fast k-means variants, the proposed
algorithm achieves hundreds to thousands times speed-up while maintaining high
clustering quality. As it is tested on 10 million 512-dimensional data, it
takes only 5.2 hours to produce 1 million clusters. In contrast, to fulfill the
same scale of clustering, it would take 3 years for traditional k-means.

a fundamental role to manipulate atomic clouds for many decades. In absence of
interactions each atom behaves independently and their coherent quantum
dynamics is described by the Rabi model. Since the experimental observation of
Bose condensation in dilute gases, static and dynamical properties of
multicomponent quantum gases have been extensively investigated. Moreover, at
very low temperatures quantum fluctuations crucially affect the equation of
state of many-body systems. Here we study the effects of quantum fluctuations
on a Rabi-coupled two-component Bose gas of interacting alkali atoms. The
divergent zero-point energy of gapless and gapped elementary excitations of the
uniform system is properly regularized obtaining a meaningful analytical
expression for the beyond-mean-field equation of state. In the case of
attractive inter-particle interaction we show that the quantum pressure arising
from Gaussian fluctuations can prevent the collapse of the mixture with the
creation of a self-bound droplet. We characterize the droplet phase and
discover an energetic instability above a critical Rabi frequency provoking the
evaporation of the droplet. Finally, we suggest an experiment to observe such
quantum droplets using Rabi-coupled internal states of $^{39}$K atoms.

function theory and density function perturbation theory coupled with Boltzmann
transport equations from first principles. The accurate Wannier interpolations
are applied to calculate the charge carrier scatterings with all branches of
phonons with dispersion contribution. The intrinsic carrier mobilities are
predicted to be 2~3$\times10^3$ cm$^2$/(V s) at 300 K, and we find that the
intervalley scatterings from the out-of-plane and transverse acoustic phonon
modes dominate the carrier relaxation. In contrast, the intrinsic carrier
mobilities obtained by the conventional deformation potential approach (Long et
al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 17728) are found to as large as
2~3$\times$10$^6$ cm$^2$/(V s) at 300 K, in which the longitudinal acoustic
phonons are assumed to be the only scattering mechanism. The inadequacy of the
deformation potential approximation in stanene is attributed to the buckling of
the honeycomb structure, which originates from the $sp^2-sp^3$ orbital
hybridization and results in broken mirror symmetry as compared to graphene.
The high carrier mobility of stanene renders it a promising candidate in
nanoelectronics and spintronics applications and we propose to enhance its
carrier mobilities by suppressing the out-of-plane vibrations by substrate
suspension or clamping.

profile of galaxies that harnesses both the survival and observed properties of

Using a grid of collisional $N$-body simulations, incorporating the effects of
stellar evolution, external tides and dynamical friction, we show that a DM
core for Eri II naturally reproduces the size and the projected position of its
star cluster. By contrast, a dense cusped galaxy requires the cluster to lie
implausibly far from the centre of Eri II (>1 kpc), with a high inclination
orbit that must be observed at a particular orbital phase. Our results,
therefore, favour a dark matter core. This implies that either a cold DM cusp
was `heated up' at the centre of Eri II by bursty star formation, or we are
seeing an evidence for physics beyond cold DM.

$X$, corresponding to the $B-L$ symmetry of the third family. Having a
relatively light (in the MeV to multi-GeV range), flavor-nonuniversal gauge

systematically analyzing 20 different constraints, we identify the most

atomic parity violation, and neutrino scattering and oscillations. For the new
gauge coupling $g_X$ in the range $(10^{-2} - 10^{-4})$ the model is shown to
be consistent with the data. Possible ways of testing the model in $b$ physics,
top and $Z$ decays, direct collider production and neutrino oscillation

non-collinear finite point set in the plane and the third one at the fixed
origin. The above distinct cross-ratio bound implies a new lower bound for the
latter question, and enables one to show growth of the set
$\sin(A-A),\;A\subset \mathbb R/\pi\mathbb Z$ under multiplication. It seems
reasonable to conjecture that more-fold product, as well as sum sets of this

stars. Understanding rotation evolution over the stellar lifetime is therefore
an important goal within stellar astrophysics. In recent years, there has been
increased focus on how the complexity of the stellar magnetic field affects the
rate of angular momentum-loss from a star. This is a topic that Zeeman-Doppler
imaging (ZDI), a technique that is capable of reconstructing the large-scale
magnetic field topology of a star, can uniquely address.
  Using a potential field source surface model, we estimate the open flux, mass
loss-rate and angular momentum-loss rates for a sample of 66 stars that have
been mapped with ZDI. We show that the open flux of a star is predominantly
determined by the dipolar component of its magnetic field for our choice of
source surface radius. We also show that, on the main sequence, the open flux,
mass- and angular momentum-loss rates increase with decreasing Rossby number.
The exception to this rule is stars less massive than $0.3M_{\odot}$. Previous
work suggests that low mass M dwarfs may possess either strong, ordered and
dipolar fields or weak and complex fields. This range of field strengths
results in a large spread of angular momentum-loss rates for these stars and
has important consequences for their spin down behaviour. Additionally, our
models do not predict a transition in the mass-loss rates at the so called wind
dividing line noted from Ly$\alpha$ studies.

Metal pollution
of white dwarfs and transient spectroscopic signatures of young stars like
$\beta$-Pic provide growing evidence that extra solar planetesimals can attain
extreme orbital eccentricities and fall onto their parent stars. We aim to
develop a general, practically implementable, semi-analytical theory of secular
eccentricity excitation of small bodies in mean motion resonances with an
eccentric planet valid for arbitrary values of the eccentricities and including
the short-range force due to General Relativity. Our semi-analytic model for
the restricted planar three-body problem does not make use of any series
expansion and therefore is valid for any values of eccentricities and
semi-major axes ratios. The model is based on the application of the adiabatic
principle, which is valid when the precession period of the longitude of
pericenter of the planetesimal is much longer than the libration period in the
mean motion resonance. This holds down to vanishingly small eccentricities in
resonances of order larger than 1. We provide a Mathematica notebook with the
implementation of the model allowing direct use to the interested reader. We
confirm that the 4:1 mean motion resonance with a moderately eccentric planet
is the most powerful one to lift the eccentricity of planetesimals from nearly
circular orbits to star-grazing ones. However, if the planet is too eccentric,
we find that this resonances becomes unable to pump the planetesimal's
eccentricity to very high value. The inclusion of the General Relativity effect
imposes a condition on the mass of the planet to drive the planetsimals into
star-grazing orbits. For a planetesimal at $\sim$1 AU around a solar-mass star
(or white dwarf), we find a threshold planetary mass of about 17 Earth masses.
We finally derive an analytical formula for this critical mass.

industrial grade cold air test setup, which is a milestone towards obtaining a
fully developed throttleable rocket gas generator controller. Simulation and

understand the fundamental physics of the strong gravity regime. A possible
tilt of such a disc, with respect to the black hole spin equator, is important.
This is because such a tilt affects the observed spectral and timing properties
of the disc X-ray emission via Lense-Thirring precession, which could be used
to test the theoretical predictions regarding the strong gravity. Here, we
analytically solve the steady, warped accretion disc equation of Scheurer and
Feiler (1996), and find an expression of the radial profile of the disc tilt
angle. In our exact solution, considering a prograde disc around a slowly
spinning black hole, we include the inner part of the disc, which was not done
earlier in this formalism. Such a solution is timely, as a tilted inner disc
has recently been inferred from X-ray spectral and timing features of the
accreting black hole H1743-322. Our tilt angle radial profile expression
includes observationally measurable parameters, such as black hole mass and
Kerr parameter, and the disc inner edge tilt angle $W_{\rm in}$, and hence can
be ideal to confront observations. Our solution shows that the disc tilt angle
in $10-100$ gravitational radii is a significant fraction of the disc outer
edge tilt angle, even for $W_{\rm in} = 0$. Moreover, tilt angle radial
profiles have humps in $\sim 10-1000$ gravitational radii for some sets of
parameter values, which should have implications for observed X-ray features.

Currently, the most promising technology to achieve this task, exploits the

and video source identification are still treated separately from one another.
This approach is limited and anachronistic if we consider that most of the
visual media are today acquired using smartphones, that capture both images and
videos. In this paper we overcome this limitation by exploring a new approach
that allows to synergistically exploit images and videos to study the device
from which they both come. Indeed, we prove it is possible to identify the
source of a digital video by exploiting a reference sensor pattern noise
generated from still images taken by the same device of the query video. The
proposed method provides comparable or even better performance, when compared
to the current video identification strategies, where a reference pattern is
estimated from video frames. We also show how this strategy can be effective
even in case of in-camera digitally stabilized videos, where a non-stabilized
reference is not available, by solving some state-of-the-art limitations. We
explore a possible direct application of this result, that is social media

U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry of this model is extended by a dark $U(1)_X$ group
plus inclusion of a heavy neutral vector-like fermion $\chi_{L,R}$ charged
under the dark group which plays the role of dark matter. All fermions are
Dirac type in this model. Decay of heavy scalars charged under $U(1)_X$ leads
to simultaneous asymmetry generation of the dark matter and baryons after
sphaleron effects are included. The $U(1)_X$ group not only helps to stabilize
the dark matter but also helps in the elimination of the symmetric part of the
dark matter via $\chi-\bar{\chi}$ annihilation. For dark matter mass near the
proton mass, it explains why the baryon and dark matter abundances are of
similar magnitude (the baryon-dark-matter coincidence problem). This model is
testable in low threshold (sub-keV) direct dark matter search experiments.

understanding the evolution of the black holes. Although they are widely

successful detection of massive stellar-mass black holes by advanced LIGO,
through the gravitational wave radiation during the binary merger, in this work
we investigate the prospect of detecting/identifying the lightest IMBHs

gravitational wave detectors. In general, the chance of hearing the birth of
the LIMBHs is significantly higher than that to identify pre-merger IMBHs. The
other formation channel of LIMBHs, where stars with huge mass/low-metallicity
directly collapse, is likely ""silent"", so the merger-driven birth of the LIMBHs
may be the only ""observable"" scenario in the near future. Moreover, the
prospect of establishing the presence of (lightest) intermediate mass black
holes in the O3 run and beyond of advanced LIGO is found quite promising,
implying that such an instrument could make another breakthrough on astronomy
in the near future. The joining of other detectors like advanced Virgo would
only increase the detection rate.

Using vanishing cycles, we introduce and study a functor from the category of

uniformly compactly supported and the order of the corresponding distribution
is uniformly bounded. Relying on a recent work by Yoann Dabrowski, several

view of physical applications, it is shown that most formal manipulations can

to make when one tries to predict the system's future state. The latter task is
usually hampered by hard-to-quantify aspects of the original description,
limited data storage and processing resource, and possibly algorithmic
inadequacy. Factors 2 and 3 introduce randomness into one's predictions and
accordingly degrade them. When forecasting, as long as the entropy bookkeping
is conducted in an HONEST fashion, this degradation will ALWAYS lead to an
entropy increase.
  To clarify the above point we introduce the notion of HONEST ENTROPY, which
coalesces much of what is of course already done, often tacitly, in responsible
entropy-bookkeping practice. This notion, we believe, will help to fill an
expressivity gap in scientific discourse. With its help we shall prove that ANY
dynamical system---not just our physical universe---strictly obeys Clausius's
original formulation of the second law of thermodynamics IF AND ONLY IF it is
invertible. Thus this law is a TAUTOLOGICAL PROPERTY of invertible systems!

invariant under local Lorentz transformations, and thus the theory does not
inherit the causal structure of special relativity. A locally Lorentz covariant
$f(T)$ gravity theory has been devised recently, and this local causality
problem has been overcome. The nonlocal question, however, is left open. If
gravitation is to be described by this covariant $f(T)$ gravity theory there
are a number of issues that ought to be examined in its context, including the
question as to whether its field equations allow homogeneous G\""odel-type
solutions, which necessarily leads to violation of causality on nonlocal scale.
Here, to look into the potentialities and difficulties of the covariant $f(T)$
theories, we examine whether they admit G\""odel-type solutions. We take a
combination of a perfect fluid with electromagnetic plus a scalar field as
source, and determine a general G\""odel-type solution, which contains special
solutions in which the essential parameter of G\""odel-type geometries, $m^2$,
defines any class of homogeneous G\""odel-type geometries. We extended to the
context of covariant $f(T)$ gravity a theorem, which ensures that any
perfect-fluid homogeneous G\""odel-type solution defines the same set of G\""odel
tetrads $h_A^{~\mu}$ up to a Lorentz transformation. We also shown that the
single massless scalar field generates G\""odel-type solution with no closed
timelike curves. Even though the covariant $f(T)$ gravity restores Lorentz
covariance of the field equations and the local validity of the causality
principle, the bare existence of the G\""odel-type solutions makes apparent that
the covariant formulation of $f(T)$ gravity does not preclude non-local
violation of causality in the form of closed timelike curves.

{\alpha}-stable distributions to estimate parameters from financial asset
log-returns data. We discuss four-parameter estimation methods including the
quantiles, logarithmic moments method, maximum likelihood (ML), and the
empirical characteristics function (ECF) method. The contribution of the paper
is two-fold: first, we discuss the above parametric approaches and investigate
their performance through error analysis. Moreover, we argue that the ECF
performs better than the ML over a wide range of shape parameter values,
{\alpha}{\alpha} including values closest to 0 and 2 and that the ECF has a
better convergence rate than the ML. Secondly, we compare the t location-scale
distribution to the general stable distribution and show that the former fails
to capture skewness which might exist in the data. This is observed through
applying the ECF to commodity futures log-returns data to obtain the skewness
parameter.
