assumption, the form of spectrum is dictated by the trace of energy momentum
tensor in QCD. This provides the relativistic and renormalization invariance of
hadron masses. The constructed scheme is applied to the light mesons for which
two complementary interpretations are worked out. The first one represents an
""atomic"" structure of resonances above 1 GeV in which the quanta of
non-perturbative gluon contributions are quantified via an effective formation
of quasiparticles representing likely gluon analogues of positronium. This
picture allows to build a ""periodic table of the hadronic elements"", i.e. to
classify hadrons, in some sense, in analogy with Mendeleev table in chemistry.
The classification does not require introduction of the orbital angular
momentum associated with hadron constituents. The Regge and radial trajectories
emerge in a natural way. The second interpretation is based on a ""collisional""
nature of some (or many) hadrons, specifically of scalar resonances below 1
GeV. Here the role of quasiparticles is played by another hadron. This picture
in particular leads to a simple explanation of the puzzling scalar sector below

nanofocusing and near-field heat induction using conical gold plasmonic
antennas to generate sub-100 nm thermal gradients for time-resolved

peaked directly under the antenna or are annular, depending on the sample's

that the thermal gradient is confined to 40 nm to 60 nm full width at half

mitigate this variation, which is undesirable for microscopy, we investigate
the use of a platinum capping layer on top of the sample as a thermal

After determining the optimal capping layer thickness, we simulate the

the temporal width is below 10 ps. These results lay a theoretical foundation

Equivalently, $R_H$ is weakly temperature dependent in the GCFL regime, and
becomes strongly $T$-dependent in the GCSM regime. Drude peaks are found for
both the longitudinal optical conductivity $\sigma_{xx}(\omega)$ and the

can be particularly significant when attempting to measure intrinsically small

effects of particle noise on halo spin parameters. This model is calibrated
using N-body simulations in which the particle noise can be treated as a
Poisson process on the underlying dark matter distribution function, and we
demonstrate that this calibrated model reproduces measurements of halo spin
parameter error distributions previously measured in N-body convergence
studies. Utilizing this model, along with previous measurements of the
distribution of halo spin parameters in N-body simulations, we place
constraints on the noise-free distribution of halo spins. We find that the
noise-free median spin is 3% lower than that measured directly from the N-body
simulation, corresponding to a shift of approximately 40 times the statistical
uncertainty in this measurement arising purely from halo counting statistics.
We also show that measurement of the spin of an individual halo to 10%

Ori provides us an ideal target for experiments and observations (being a

interferometric observations of the disk around the triple pre-main-sequence

in the $^{12}{\rm CO} J=2-1$, $^{13}{\rm CO} J=2-1$, and ${\rm C^{18}O} J=2-1$
lines. These new data reveal a huge, massive, and bright disk in the GW Ori
system. The dust continuum emission suggests a disk radius around 400 AU. But,
the $^{12}{\rm CO} J=2-1$ emission shows much more extended disk with a size
around 1300 AU. Due to the spatial resolution ($\sim$1$""$), we cannot detect
the gap in the disk which is inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED)
modeling. We characterize the dust and gas properties in the disk by comparing
the observations with the predictions from the disk models with various
parameters calculated with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. The
disk mass is around 0.12 $M_{\odot}$, and the disk inclination with respect to
the line of sight is around $\sim$ 35$^\circ$. The kinematics in the disk
traced by the CO line emission strongly suggest that the circumstellar material
in the disk is in Keplerian rotation around GW Ori. Tentatively substantial
${\rm C^{18}O}$ depletion in gas phase is required to explain the
characteristics of the line emission from the disk.

have no option to select their energy supplier. In a world of where many

underlying active smooth manifolds. We also show how our results for
Primal-Dual splitting can be specialized to cover existing ones on
Forward-Backward splitting and Douglas-Rachford splitting/ADMM (alternating

on subnanosecond timescales in magnetic racetracks at artificial or natural

to SOT-induced switching of uniformly magnetized elements, but due to the

all local low-mass quenched galaxies (QGs) are believed to live close to
massive central galaxies, which is a demonstration of environmental quenching.
We use CANDELS data to test {\it whether or not} such a dwarf QG--massive
central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. To this purpose, we
only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of
low-mass galaxies, which enables our study to $z\gtrsim1.5$. For each low-mass
galaxy, we measure the projected distance ($d_{proj}$) to its nearest massive
neighbor (M*$>10^{10.5} M_\odot$) within a redshift range. At a given redshift
and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the
$d_{proj}$ distribution of QGs ($d_{proj}^Q$) is significantly skewed toward
lower values than that of star-forming galaxies ($d_{proj}^{SF}$). For galaxies
with $10^{8} M_\odot < M* < 10^{10} M_\odot$, such a difference between
$d_{proj}^Q$ and $d_{proj}^{SF}$ is detected up to $z\sim1$. Also, about 10\%
of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four virial
radii ($R_{Vir}$) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from
low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors, $d_{proj}^Q / R_{Vir}$, decreases with
satellite M* at $M* \lesssim 10^{9.5} M_\odot$, but increases with satellite M*

Additionally, we performe integral field spectroscopy of the host galaxy of
PTF~11hrq using the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer
(VLT/MUSE), and investigate the line strength, metallicity and kinematics.
Neither PTF~11hrq nor PTF~12dam occurred in the bluest part of their host
galaxies, although both galaxies have overall blue UV-to-optical colors. The
MUSE data reveal a bright starbursting region in the host of PTF~11hrq,
although far from the SN location. The SN exploded close to a region with
disturbed kinematics, bluer color, stronger [OIII], and lower metallicity. The
host galaxy is likely interacting with a companion. PTF~12dam occurred in one
of the brightest pixels, in a starbursting galaxy with a complex morphology and
a tidal tail, where interaction is also very likely. We speculate that SLSN
explosions may originate from stars generated during star-formation episodes
triggered by interaction. High resolution imaging and integral field
spectroscopy are fundamental for a better understanding of SLSNe explosion
sites and how star formation varies across their host galaxies.

quantum corrections to BPS black hole entropy. The program has been successful

polar states in the Rademacher expansion, which describes the entropy in the
microcanonical ensemble. We propose that these non-perturbative effects can be
identified with a new family of saddles in the localization of the quantum
entropy path integral. We argue that these saddles, which are euclidean
$AdS_2\times S^1\times S^2$ geometries, arise after turning on singular fluxes
in M-theory on a Calabi-Yau. They cease to exist after a certain amount of
flux, resulting in a finite number of geometries; the bound on that number is
in precise agreement with the stringy exclusion principle. Localization of
supergravity on these backgrounds gives rise to a finite tail of Bessel
functions in agreement with the Rademacher expansion. As a check of our
proposal, we test our results against well-known microscopic formulas for
one-eighth and one-quarter BPS black holes in $\mathcal{N}=8$ and
$\mathcal{N}=4$ string theory respectively, finding agreement. Our method
breaks down precisely when mock-modular effects are expected in the entropy of

several quantum materials can lead to the appearance of an unusual
thermodynamic state in which both orders coexist microscopically, despite their
competing nature. A hallmark of this coexistence state is the emergence of a
spin-triplet superconducting gap component, called $\pi$-triplet, which is
spatially modulated by the antiferromagnetic wave-vector, reminiscent of a
pair-density wave. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these
$\pi$-triplet degrees of freedom on the phase diagram of a system with
competing antiferromagnetic and superconducting orders. Although we focus on a
microscopic two-band model that has been widely employed in studies of iron
pnictides, most of our results follow from a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, and as
such should be applicable to other systems of interest, such as cuprates and
heavy fermions. The Ginzburg-Landau functional reveals not only that the
$\pi$-triplet gap amplitude couples tri-linearly with the singlet gap amplitude
and the staggered magnetization magnitude, but also that the $\pi$-triplet
$d$-vector couples linearly with the magnetization direction. While in the mean
field level this coupling forces the $d$-vector to align parallel or
anti-parallel to the magnetization, in the fluctuation regime it promotes two
additional collective modes - a Goldstone mode related to the precession of the
$d$-vector around the magnetization and a massive mode, related to the relative
angle between the two vectors, which is nearly degenerate with a Leggett-like
mode associated with the phase difference between the singlet and triplet gaps.
We also investigate the impact of magnetic fluctuations on the
superconducting-antiferromagnetic phase diagram, showing that due to their
coupling with the $\pi$-triplet order parameter, the coexistence region is
enhanced.

the restoring force of a linearly polarized Alfv\'enic perturbation, and occurs
for wave amplitudes $\delta B_{\perp}/B_{0}\gtrsim \beta^{\,-1/2}$ (where
$\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure). We use highly elongated
domains to obtain maximal scale separation between the wave and the ion
gyroscale. For standing waves above the amplitude limit, we find that the
large-scale magnetic field of the wave decays rapidly. The dynamics are
strongly affected by the excitation of oblique firehose modes, which transition
into long-lived parallel fluctuations at the ion gyroscale and cause
significant particle scattering. Traveling waves are damped more slowly, but
are also influenced by small-scale parallel fluctuations created by the decay
of firehose modes. Our results demonstrate that collisionless plasmas cannot
support linearly polarized Alfv\'en waves above $\delta B_{\perp}/B_{0}\sim

well describe, at low energies, the behaviour of the gravity modifications due

useful when studying the conditions for the avoidance of ghost instabilities as
well as the positivity of the squared speeds of propagation for both the scalar

investigating the evolution of linear perturbations. We show that the viable
parameters space identified by requiring no-ghost instabilities and positive
squared speeds of propagation does not change by performing a field
redefinition, while the requirement of the avoidance of tachyonic instability
might instead be different. Therefore, we find interesting to associate to the
general modified gravity theory described in the effective field theory
framework, a perturbation field which will inherit the whole properties of the
theory. In the present paper we address the following questions: 1) how can we
define such a field? and 2) what is the mass of such a field as the background
approaches a final de Sitter state? We define a gauge invariant quantity which
identifies the density of the dark energy perturbation field valid for any
background. We derive the mass associated to the gauge invariant dark energy
field on a de Sitter background, which we retain to be still a good
approximation also at very low redshift ($z\simeq 0$). On this background we
also investigate the value of the speed of propagation and we find that there
exist classes of theories which admit a non-vanishing speed of propagation,
even among the Horndeski model, for which in literature it has previously been

aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect
decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to
make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on
potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a
long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare
professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they
developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the
proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the
phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a

RR Lyrae stars (RRL) at Spitzer and WISE wavelengths. The PLZ relations were
derived using nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models for a
broad range in metal abundances (Z=0.0001 to 0.0198). In deriving the light
curves, we tested two sets of atmospheric models (Brott & Hauschildt 2005,
Castelli & Kurucz 2003) and found no significant difference between the
resulting mean magnitudes. We also compare our theoretical relations to
empirical relations derived from RRL in both the field and in the globular
cluster M4. Our theoretical PLZ relations were combined with multi-wavelength
observations to simultaneously fit the distance modulus, mu_0, and extinction,
Av, of both the individual Galactic RRL and of the cluster M4. The results for
the Galactic RRL are consistent with trigonometric parallax measurements from
Gaia's first data release. For M4, we find a distance modulus of $\mu_0=11.257
\pm 0.035$ mag with $A_V = 1.45 \pm 0.12$ mag, which is consistent with
measurements from other distance indicators. This analysis has shown that when
considering a sample covering a range of iron abundances, the metallicity
spread introduces a dispersion in the PL relation on the order of 0.13 mag.
However, if this metallicity component is accounted for in a PLZ relation, the
dispersion is reduced to ~0.02 mag at MIR wavelengths.

particle called jets. Experimental measurements from high momentum hadrons, two
particle correlations, and full jet reconstruction at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) continue to improve our
understanding of energy loss in the QGP. Run 2 at the LHC recently began and
there is a jet detector at RHIC under development. Now is the perfect time to
reflect on what the experimental measurements have taught us so far, the
limitations of the techniques used for studying jets, how the techniques can be
improved, and how to move forward with the wealth of experimental data such
that a complete description of energy loss in the QGP can be achieved.
  Measurements of jets to date clearly indicate that hard partons lose energy.
Detailed comparisons of the nuclear modification factor between data and model
calculations led to quantitative constraints on the opacity of the medium to
hard probes. While there is substantial evidence for softening and broadening
jets through medium interactions, the difficulties comparing measurements to
theoretical calculations limit further quantitative constraints on energy loss
mechanisms. We call for an agreement between theorists and experimentalists on
the appropriate treatment of the background, Monte Carlo generators that enable
experimental algorithms to be applied to theoretical calculations, and a clear
understanding of which observables are most sensitive to the properties of the
medium, even in the presence of background. This will enable us to determine
the best strategy for the field to improve quantitative constraints on
properties of the medium in the face of these challenges.

multiwavelength analysis of three mini-outbursts and one normal outburst
represent one of the most complete multiwavelength studies of a DN and help to
refine the relationship between the X-ray, UV and optical emission in this

$1.0-5.4$ days during the rising phase of the outburst. The X-ray emission is
suppressed during the peak of the optical outburst and recovers during the end
of the outburst. From our analysis of archival Swift, Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations of AX J1549.8$-$5416, we estimate this DN has a high duty cycle
($\sim50\%$), suggesting a quiescent X-ray luminosity larger than $10^{32}$
erg/s. We also find the X-ray and UV flux are roughly anti-correlated.
Furthermore, we find that, at low X-ray fluxes, the X-ray spectrum is well
described by a single temperature thermal plasma model, while at high X-ray

flow, and leading to a reduction in the turbulent skin-friction drag. The
pressure- and friction-drag levels are carefully quantified for various flow
configurations, exhibiting a combined maximum overall-drag reduction of about
0.5%. The friction-drag reduction is shown to behave approximately
quadratically for small wave slopes and then linearly for higher slopes, whilst
the pressure-drag penalty increases quadratically. Unlike in the SSL case,
there is a region of increased turbulence production over a portion of the
wall, above the leeward side of the wave, thus giving rise to a local increase
in dissipation. The transverse shear-strain layer is shown to be approximately
Reynolds-number independent when the wave geometry is scaled in wall units.

speedup over a very efficient baseline decoder without changing the decoder
output. Second, we propose a simple but powerful network architecture which
uses an RNN (GRU/LSTM) layer at bottom, followed by a series of stacked
fully-connected layers applied at every timestep. This architecture achieves
similar accuracy to a deep recurrent model, at a small fraction of the training

very competitive accuracy of 38.3 BLEU on WMT English-French NewsTest2014,

orbital evolution of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) binary systems for various

accretion modes. The time evolution of binary separations and orbital periods
are calculated directly from the averaged mass loss rate, accretion rate and
angular momentum loss rate. We separately consider spin-orbit synchronized and
zero spin AGB cases. We find that the the angular momentum carried away by the
mass loss together with the mass transfer can effectively shrink the orbit when
accretion occurs via wind-Roche-lobe overflow. In contrast, the larger fraction
of mass lost in Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accreting systems acts to enlarge the
orbit. Synchronized binaries tend to experience stronger orbital period decay
in close binaries. We also find that orbital period decay is faster when we
account for the nonlinear evolution of the accretion mode as the binary starts
to tighten. This can increase the fraction of binaries that result in common
envelope, luminous red novae, Type Ia supernovae and planetary nebulae with
tight central binaries. The results also imply that planets in the the

is ensemble-divergence, whereby different samples within an ensemble choose
different code paths. This can reduce the effectiveness of the method and
increase computational cost. Therefore grouping samples together to minimize
this divergence is paramount in making the method effective for challenging
computational simulations. In this work, a new grouping approach based on a
surrogate for computational cost built up during the uncertainty propagation is
developed and applied to model diffusion problems where computational cost is
driven by the number of (preconditioned) linear solver iterations. The approach
is developed within the context of locally adaptive stochastic collocation
methods, where a surrogate for the number of linear solver iterations,
generated from previous levels of the adaptive grid generation, is used to
predict iterations for subsequent samples, and group them based on similar
numbers of iterations. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by
applying it to highly anisotropic diffusion problems with a wide variation in
solver iterations from sample to sample. It extends the parameter-based
grouping approach developed in [17] to more general problems without requiring
detailed knowledge of how the uncertain parameters affect the simulation's
cost, and is also less intrusive to the simulation code.

intersection cuts derived from families of lattice-free sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
In particular, we look at the problem of characterizing families that
approximate the corner polyhedron up to a constant factor, which depends only
on $n$ and not the data or dimension of the corner polyhedron. The literature
already contains several results in this direction. In this paper, we use the
maximum number of facets of lattice-free sets in a family as a measure of its
complexity and precisely characterize the level of complexity of a family
required for constant factor approximations. As one of the main results, we
show that, for each natural number $n$, a corner polyhedron with $n$ basic
integer variables and an arbitrary number of continuous non-basic variables is
approximated up to a constant factor by intersection cuts from lattice-free
sets with at most $i$ facets if $i> 2^{n-1}$ and that no such approximation is
possible if $i \leq 2^{n-1}$. When the approximation factor is allowed to
depend on the denominator of the fractional vertex of the linear relaxation of
the corner polyhedron, we show that the threshold is $i > n$ versus $i \leq n$.
The tools introduced for proving such results are of independent interest for
studying intersection cuts.

precision matrix, estimating its non-null entries, and incorporating the
inferred concentration matrix in the prediction of marker allelic effects. To
this end, we developed a set of statistical methods based on Gaussian
concentration graph models (GCGM) and Gaussian directed acyclic graph models
(GDAGM) that adapt the existing theory to perform covariance model selection
(GCGM) or DAG selection (GDAGM) to genome-wide prediction. Bayesian and
frequentist approaches were formulated. Our frequentist formulations combined
some existing methods with the EM algorithm and were termed Glasso-EM,
CONCORD-EM and CSCS-EM, whereas our Bayesian formulations corresponded to
hierarchical models termed Bayes G-Sel and Bayes DAG-Sel. Results from a
simulation study showed that our methods can accurately recover the partial
correlation structure and estimate the precision matrix. Methods CONCORD-EM and
Bayes G-Sel had an outstanding performance in estimating the partial
correlation structure and a method based on CONCORD-EM yielded the most
accurate estimates of the precision matrix. Our methods can be used as
predictive machines and as tools to learn about the covariation of effects of
pairs of loci on a given phenotype conditioned on the effects of all the other

show complex behavior as a function of Zeeman splitting and chemical potential,
and the specific question is whether two such ABSs can come together forming a
topological MBS. We consider physical situations involving the dot being
non-SC, SC, or partially SC. We find that the ABSs indeed tend to coalesce
together producing near-zero-energy midgap states as Zeeman splitting and/or
chemical potential are increased, but this mostly happens in the
non-topological regime although there are situations where the ABSs could come
together forming a topological MBS. The two scenarios(two ABSs forming a
near-zero-energy non-topological ABS or a zero-energy topological MBS) are
difficult to distinguish by tunneling conductance spectroscopy due to
essentially the same signatures. Theoretically we distinguish them by knowing
the critical Zeeman splitting for the topological quantum phase transition or
by calculating the topological visibility. We find that the ""sticking together""
propensity of ABSs to produce a zero-energy midgap state is generic in class D
systems, and by itself says nothing about the topological nature of the
underlying SC nanowire. One must use caution in interpreting tunneling
conductance measurements where the midgap sticking-together behavior of ABSs
cannot be construed as definitive evidence for topological SC with non-Abelian
MBSs. We also suggest some experimental techniques for distinguishing between

  Mean-Field Interactions",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Establishing the existence of Nash equilibria for partially observed
stochastic dynamic games is known to be quite challenging, with the
difficulties stemming from the noisy nature of the measurements available to
individual players (agents) and the decentralized nature of this information.
When the number of players is sufficiently large and the interactions among
agents is of the mean-field type, one way to overcome this challenge is to
investigate the infinite-population limit of the problem, which leads to a
mean-field game. In this paper, we consider discrete-time partially observed
mean-field games with infinite-horizon discounted cost criteria. Using the
technique of converting the original partially observed stochastic control
problem to a fully observed one on the belief space and the dynamic programming
principle, we establish the existence of Nash equilibria for these game models
under very mild technical conditions. Then, we show that the mean-field
equilibrium policy, when adopted by each agent, forms an approximate Nash
equilibrium for games with sufficiently many agents.

for studying the shape of point cloud and other data types. One popular
approach, designed to be robust to noise and outliers, is to first use a
smoothing function to convert the point cloud into a manifold and then apply
persistent homology to a Morse filtration. A significant challenge is that this
smoothing process involves the choice of a parameter and persistent homology is
highly sensitive to that choice; moreover, important scale information is lost.
We propose a novel topological summary plot, called a persistence terrace, that
incorporates a wide range of smoothing parameters and is robust, multi-scale,
and parameter-free. This plot allows one to isolate distinct topological
signals that may have merged for any fixed value of the smoothing parameter,
and it also allows one to infer the size and point density of the topological
features. We illustrate our method in some simple settings where noise is a
serious issue for existing frameworks and then we apply it to a real data set
by counting muscle fibers in a cross-sectional image.

independent fast multipole method (KIFMM) is the capability for flexibly and
efficiently imposing singly, doubly, and triply periodic boundary conditions.
In most popular packages such periodicities are imposed with the hierarchical
repetition of periodic boxes, which may give an incorrect answer due to the
conditional convergence of some kernel sums. Here we present an efficient
method to properly impose periodic boundary conditions using a near-far
splitting scheme. The near-field contribution is directly calculated with the
KIFMM method, while the far-field contribution is calculated with a
multipole-to-local (M2L) operator which is independent of the source and target
point distribution. The M2L operator is constructed with the far-field portion
of the kernel function to generate the far-field contribution with the downward
equivalent source points in KIFMM. This method guarantees the sum of the
near-field \& far-field converge pointwise to results satisfying periodicity
and compatibility conditions. The computational cost of the far-field
calculation observes the same $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity as FMM and is
designed to be small by reusing the data computed by KIFMM for the near-field.
The far-field calculations require no additional control parameters, and
observes the same theoretical error bound as KIFMM. We present accuracy and
timing test results for the Laplace kernel in singly periodic domains and the
Stokes velocity kernel in doubly and triply periodic domains.

information can be gleaned from the data, via higher-order interactions among

data is very sparse, as is often the case in real-world datasets. In this
paper, we design a method to learn embeddings in the context of recommendation
systems, using the observation that higher powers of a graph transition
probability matrix encode the probability that a random walker will hit that
node in a given number of steps. We develop a coordinate descent algorithm to
solve the resulting optimization, that makes explicit computation of the higher

computations efficient. Experiments on several datasets show that our method,
that can use higher order information, outperforms methods that only use

to mid-sized regions and contain a signed flux within a single polarity sunspot
of $(1.1-6.5)\times 10^{21}$ Mx. The net unsigned flux within the regions,
including plage, ranges from $(5.1-20)\times 10^{21}$ Mx. Rates are calculated
with and without intensity contours to differentiate between sunspot formation
and flux emergence. Signed flux emergence rates, calculated with intensity
contours, for the p (f) spots average $6.8$ (4.9) $\times 10^{19}$ Mx h$^{-1}$,
while decay rates are $-1.9 (-3.4)\times 10^{19}$ Mx h$^{-1}$. The mean, signed
flux emergence rate of the regions, including plage, is $7.1 \times 10^{19}$ Mx
h$^{-1}$ for a mean peak flux of $5.9 \times 10^{21}$ Mx. Using a synthesis of
these results and others reported previously, there is a clear trend for larger
flux regions to emerge faster than smaller ones. Observed emergence rates
($d{\phi}/dt$, Mx h$^{-1}$) scale with total signed peak flux,
$\tilde{\phi}_{max}$, as a power law with an exponent of 0.36, i.e.,
$d{\phi}/dt = A \tilde{\phi}_{max}^{0.36}$. The observed rates may assist in
constraining the boundary and initial conditions in simulations which already
demonstrate increased rates for flux tubes with higher buoyancy and twist, or
in the presence of a strong upflow. Overall, the observed emergence rates are
smaller than those in simulations, which may indicate a slower rise of the flux
in the interior than captured in simulations.

  Systems for Buildings",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) systems are often the most
significant contributor to the energy usage, and the operational cost, of large
office buildings. Therefore, to understand the various factors affecting the
energy usage, and to optimize the operational efficiency of building HVAC
systems, energy analysts and architects often create simulations (e.g.,
EnergyPlus or DOE-2), of buildings prior to construction or renovation to
determine energy savings and quantify the Return-on-Investment (ROI). While
useful, these simulations usually use static HVAC control strategies such as
lowering room temperature at night, or reactive control based on simulated room
occupancy. Recently, advances have been made in HVAC control algorithms that
predict room occupancy. However, these algorithms depend on costly sensor
installations and the tradeoffs between predictive accuracy, energy savings,
comfort and expenses are not well understood. Current simulation frameworks do
not support easy analysis of these tradeoffs. Our contribution is a simulation
framework that can be used to explore this design space by generating objective
estimates of the energy savings and occupant comfort for different levels of
HVAC prediction and control performance. We validate our framework on a
real-world occupancy dataset spanning 6 months for 235 rooms in a large
university office building. Using the gold standard of energy use modeling and
simulation (Revit and Energy Plus), we compare the energy consumption and
occupant comfort in 29 independent simulations that explore our parameter
space. Our results highlight a number of potentially useful tradeoffs with
respect to energy savings, comfort, and algorithmic performance among
predictive, reactive, and static schedules, for a stakeholder of our building.

additional phonon surface scattering through nanostructures. However, how
phonons interact with boundaries, especially at the atomic level, is not well
understood. In this work, we performed two-dimensional atomistic wave packet
simulations to investigate the phonon surface interaction. Emphasis has been
given to the angular-resolved phonon reflection at smooth, periodically rough,
and amorphous surfaces. We found that the acoustic phonon reflection at a
smooth surface is not simply specular. Mode conversion can occur after
reflection, and the detailed energy distribution after reflection will
dependent on surface condition and polarization of incident phonon. At
periodically rough surfaces, the reflected wave packet distribution does not
follow the well-known Ziman's model, but shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the
depth of surface roughness. When an amorphous layer is attached to the surface,
the incident wave packet will be absorbed by the amorphous region, and results
in quite diffusive reflection. Our results clearly show that the commonly used
specular-diffusive model is not enough to describe the phonon reflection at a
periodically rough surface, while an amorphous layer can induce strong
diffusive reflection. This work provides a careful analysis of phonon
reflection at a surface with different morphology, which is important to a
better understanding of thermal transport in various nanostructures.

Ito, Iwata, and Murota~(1994), and is closely related to the noncommutative

submodular optimization on modular lattice and convex optimization on

present that, if the extra dimension is timelike oppositely, the negative
$\Lambda$ will be emerged and the induced 4D space will be an asymptotic
Anti-de Sitter (AdS). Under the minimum assumption, we solve the Kaluza-Klein
equation $R_{AB} = 0$ in a canonical system and obtain the AdS solution in a
general case. The result shows that an AdS space is induced naturally from a
Kaluza-Klein manifold on a hypersurface (brane). The Lagrangian of test
particle indicates the equation of motion can be geodesics if the 4D metric is
independent of extra dimension. The causality is well respected because it is
appropriately defined by a null higher dimensional interval. In this 5D
relativity, the holographic principle can be used safely because the brane is
asymptotic Euclidean AdS in the bulk. We also explore some possible holographic

open string coupling and the NC structure $\Theta$ is directly related to the
conformal twist. One novel feature is that $\Theta$ exhibits ""holographic

holographic direction, its value everywhere in the bulk is uniquely determined
by its value at the boundary, thus facilitating introduction of a dual NC gauge
theory. We show that the divergence of the NC structure $\Theta$ is directly

observing frequency. A search for more rapid variability revealed no evidence
for significant day-scale flux density variation. The ATCA light-curve reveals
a strong radio flare beginning in late 2013 which peaks higher, and earlier, at

this followed ~9 months after the start of a prolonged gamma-ray high-state --
a radio lag comparable to that seen in other blazars. The multiwavelength data

suite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias, i.e., the
difference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter
inside halos. We find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the
ratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass. In general, central galaxies
are not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos, with a
velocity dispersion above 0.04 times that of the dark matter. The central
galaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions
between the central and satellite galaxies. For satellite galaxies, the
velocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after
being accreted onto the host halos. It depends on the time after the accretion
and their distances from the halo centers, with massive satellites generally
moving more slowly than the dark matter. The results are in broad agreements
with those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering
data, and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy
clustering.

randomly generated trees are constructed so as to optimize a balance between
the size of the tree and the complexity required to draw Boltzmann samples from
it. We benchmark the algorithm on several classes of problems and demonstrate
its advantages over existing approaches.

problems is defined which involves discretizing two linear operators: (1) the

Riesz map on the test space. The resulting linear system is overdetermined. Two
different approaches for solving the system are suggested (although others are
discussed): (1) solving the associated normal equation with linear solvers for
symmetric positive-definite systems (e.g. Cholesky factorization); and (2)
solving the overdetermined system with orthogonalization algorithms (e.g. QR
factorization). The finite element assembly algorithm for each of these
approaches is described in detail. The normal equation approach is usually
faster for direct solvers and requires less storage. The second approach
reduces the condition number of the system by a power of two and is less
sensitive to round-off error. The rectangular stiffness matrix of second
approach is demonstrated to have condition number $\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ for a
variety of formulations of Poisson's equation. The stiffness matrix from the
normal equation approach is demonstrated to be related to the monolithic
stiffness matrices of least-squares finite element methods and it is proved
that the two are identical in some cases. An example with Poisson's equation
indicates that the solutions of these two different linear systems can be
nearly indistinguishable (if round-off error is not an issue) and rapidly
converge to each other. The orthogonalization approach is suggested to be
beneficial for problems which induce poorly conditioned linear systems.
Experiments with Poisson's equation in single-precision arithmetic as well as
the linear acoustics problem near resonance in double-precision arithmetic
verify this conclusion.

4.5km/s, and the average sky subtraction residuals are about 3% for sky
emission lines and 3% for continuum region. The relative sky subtraction
residuals vary with the moon light background brightness, could reach as low as

of the form $G_{V}\times{}G_{D}$ where $G_{V}$ is the visible gauge group
containing the Standard Model and $G_{D}$ is the gauge group responsible for
self-interactions amongst components of dark matter. In some models, there is
also an additional spontaneously broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry coupling the
visible and dark sectors at high energies. One theoretical problem is how to
unify the visible and dark sectors by inducing the spontaneous breaking
$G\rightarrow{}G_{V}\times{}G_{D}$ for some large gauge group $G$. In this
paper, we discuss how to generate such a structure at low energies, in the
context of 4+1-dimensional domain-wall brane model, by employing a
generalization of the Dvali-Shifman mechanism, used to localized gauge bosons
on domain walls, called the clash-of-symmetries mechanism. In one model, we
describe a clash-of-symmetries domain wall solution in a theory with two scalar
fields in the adjoint representation which breaks the group $SU(12)$ to two
differently embedded copies of $SU(6)\times{}SU(6)\times{}U(1)$, leading to a
an effective $SU(5)_{V}\times{}SU(5)_{D}\times{}U(1)_{X}$-invariant field
theory on the wall. We find that fermions in the mixed representations of
$SU(5)_{V}\times{}SU(5)_{D}$ do not couple to the domain wall and thus remain
5D vector-like Dirac fermions, attaining masses of order $M_{GUT}$ when we
perform the breaking
$SU(5)_{V}\rightarrow{}SU(3)_{c}\times{}SU(2)_{I}\times{}U(1)_{Y}$, thus being
removed from the spectrum. We also outline how to build a few alternative
models, one based on the group $SU(9)$, and a couple more based on
non-clash-of-symmetries domain wall solutions in $SU(12)$ and $SU(10)$ models.

$L^p$-version of FTAP \cite{S:90} towards a setting with two filtrations. We do
neither assume that price processes are semi-martigales, (and it does not
follow due to trading with respect to the \emph{smaller} filtration) nor that
price processes have any path properties, neither any other particular property
of the two filtrations in question, nor admissibility of portfolio wealth

where trading strategies are just predictable with respect to a smaller

from modeling trading with delayed information, trading on different time

is proposed. This method consists of a principle of variable classification, a
procedure for problem transformation, and a hybrid algorithm that combines
deterministic and stochastic search engines. The classification principle is
used to classify the decision variables of a BMI problem into two categories:
1) external and 2) internal variables. Theoretical analysis is performed to
show that when the classification principle is applicable, a BMI problem can be
transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem that has fewer decision
variables. Stochastic search and deterministic search are then applied to
determine the decision variables of the unconstrained problem externally and
explore the internal problem structure, respectively. The proposed method can
address feasibility, single-objective, and multiobjective problems constrained
by BMIs in a unified manner. A number of numerical examples in system and
control designs are provided to validate the proposed methodology. Simulations
show that the MRVs can outperform existing BMI solution methods in most
benchmark problems and achieve similar levels of performance in the remaining
problems.

significant wings in their spectral profiles, which can be well-fitted with
non-Maxwellian kappa-distribution. The fit with a kappa-distribution can
perform better than a double Gaussian fit, especially for the strongest line,
Si IV 1402.8 A. Typical values of $\kappa$ found are about 2, occurring in a
majority of spatial pixels where the transition region lines are symmetric,
i.e., the fit can be performed. Furthermore, all five spectral lines studied
(from Si IV, O IV and S IV) appear to have the same FWHM irrespective of
whether the line is an allowed or an intercombination transition. A similar
value of kappa is obtained for the electron distribution by fitting of the line
intensities relative to Si IV 1402.8 A, if photospheric abundances are assumed.
The kappa-distributions however do not remove the presence of non-thermal
broadening. Instead, they actually increase the non-thermal width. This is
because for kappa-distributions the transition-region ions are formed at lower
temperatures. The large observed non-thermal width lowers the opacity of the Si
IV line sufficiently enough for this line to become optically thin.

(N-S) asymmetry in the occurrence of solar flares during cycle 21, 22, and 23,
and compare the results with traditional solar activity indices. Methods. The
flare activity is characterized by a soft X-ray (SXR) flare index, which
incorporates information about flare occurrences during a selected interval
along with the peak intensity of individual events. Results. The SXR flare
index correlates well with other conventional parameters of solar activity.
Further, it exhibits a significantly higher correlation with sunspot area over
sunspot number, which suggests the variations in sunspot area to be more
closely linked with the transient energy release in the solar corona. The
cumulative plots of the flare index indicate a slight excess of activity in the
northern hemisphere during cycle 21, while a southern excess clearly prevails
for cycles 22 and 23. The study reveals a significant N-S asymmetry, which
exhibits variations with the phases of solar cycle. The reliability and
persistency of this asymmetry significantly increases when the data is averaged
over longer periods, while an optimal level is achieved when data is binned for
13 Carrington rotations. The time evolution of the flare index further confirms
evolution of dual peaks in solar cycles during the solar maxima and violation
of Gnevyshev-Ohl rule for the pair of solar cycles 22 and 23. Conclusions. The
SXR flare index in the northern and the southern hemispheres of the Sun
exhibits significant asymmetry during the evolutionary phases of the solar
cycle, which implies that N-S asymmetry of solar flares is manifested in terms
of the flare counts as well as the intensity of flare events.

privacy breach which can have unpleasant social consequences. In order to
prevent inference attacks derived from geo-location data, a number of location

done to define differential privacy for geo-location data in the form of
geo-indistinguishability with l privacy guarantee. These techniques do not
utilize any prior background information about the Points of Interest (PoIs) of
a user and apply Laplacian noise to perturb all the location coordinates.
Intuitively, the utility of such a mechanism can be improved if the noise
distribution is derived after considering some prior information about PoIs.

geo-location data. We use first principles to model various privacy and utility
constraints, prior background information available about the PoIs

required by different types of apps, in order to produce a more accurate and a
utility maximizing differentially private algorithm for geo-location data at

some specific scenarios. This will also help us to verify that whether
Laplacian noise is still the optimal perturbation when we have such prior

in the next-generation mobile communication standard (5G) defined by the 3GPP.
As a result, receivers will have to implement blind detection of polar coded
frames in order to keep complexity, latency, and power consumption tractable.
As a newly proposed class of block codes, the problem of polar-code blind
detection has received very little attention. In this work, we propose a
low-complexity blind-detection algorithm for polar-encoded frames. We base this
algorithm on a novel detection metric with update rules that leverage the a
priori knowledge of the frozen-bit locations, exploiting the inherent
structures that these locations impose on a polar-encoded block of data. We
show that the proposed detection metric allows to clearly distinguish
polar-encoded frames from other types of data by considering the cumulative
distribution functions of the detection metric, and the receiver operating
characteristic. The presented results are tailored to the 5G standardization
effort discussions, i.e., we consider a short low-rate polar code concatenated
with a CRC.

their birth galactocentric distances but migrate. The importance of this radial
migration in shaping galactic light distributions is still unclear. However, if
it is indeed important, galaxies with different surface brightness (SB)
profiles must display differences in their stellar population properties. Aims:
We investigate the role of radial migration on the light distribution and the
radial stellar content by comparing the inner colour, age and metallicity
gradients for galaxies with different SB profiles. We define these inner parts
avoiding the bulge and bar regions and up to around three disc scale-lengths
(type I, pure exponential) or the break radius (type II, downbending; type III,
upbending). Methods: We analyse 214 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey
covering different SB profiles. We make use of GASP2D and SDSS data to
characterise their light distribution and obtain colour profiles. The stellar
age and metallicity profiles are computed using a methodology based on
full-spectrum fitting techniques (pPXF, GANDALF, and STECKMAP) to the IFS
CALIFA data. Results: The distributions of the colour, stellar age and stellar
metallicity gradients in the inner parts for galaxies displaying different SB
profiles are unalike as suggested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling
tests. We find a trend in which type II galaxies show the steepest profiles of
all and type III the shallowest, with type I galaxies displaying an
intermediate behaviour. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a
scenario in which radial migration is more efficient for type III galaxies than
for type I systems with type II galaxies presenting the lowest radial migration
efficiency. In such scenario, radial migration mixes the stellar content

consideration of multiple objectives. This is a high-level design and only
those microgrids with nondispatchable renewable energy sources are considered.
For a power grid in the network, the net value derived from providing power to
the network must be maximized. For a microgrid, it is desirable to maximize the
net gain derived from consuming the received power. Finally, for an independent
system operator, stored energy levels at microgrids must be maintained as close
as possible to storage capacity to secure network emergency operation. To
achieve these objectives, a multiobjective approach is proposed. The price
signal generated by the MO and power distributed by the DNO are assigned based
on a Pareto optimal solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. By using
the proposed approach, a fair scheme that does not advantage one particular
objective can be attained. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed

central limit theorem (CLT), and (iii) a local central limit theorem (LCLT) for
non-autonomous dynamical systems. A key advance is the extension of the
spectral method, commonly used in limit laws for deterministic maps, to the
general random setting. We achieve this via multiplicative ergodic theory and
the development of a general framework to control the regularity of Lyapunov
exponents of \emph{twisted transfer operator cocycles} with respect to a twist

with other techniques, the local central limit theorem is, to our knowledge, a
completely new result, and one that demonstrates the strength of our method.
Applications include non-autonomous (piecewise) expanding maps, defined by
random compositions of the form $T_{\sigma^{n-1}\omega}\circ\cdots\circ

particular, we propose a novel joint RNN model that can predict whether
sentences are argumentative or not, and use the predicted results to more

the structure and function of the human brain. Whereas the structural
connectome can be fairly straightforwardly mapped onto a complex network, there
are more degrees of freedom in constructing networks that represent functional
connections between brain areas. For fMRI data, such networks are typically
built by aggregating the BOLD signal time series of voxels into larger entities
(such as Regions of Interest in some brain atlas), and determining the
connection strengths between these from some measure of time-series
correlations. Although it is evident that the outcome of this procedure must be
affected by how the voxel-level time series are treated at the preprocessing
stage, there is a lack of systematic studies of the effects of preprocessing on
network structure. Here, we focus on the effects of spatial smoothing, which is
a standard preprocessing method for fMRI. We apply various levels of spatial
smoothing to resting-state fMRI data, and measure the changes induced in the
corresponding functional networks. We show that the level of spatial smoothing
clearly affects the degrees and other centrality measures of the nodes of the
functional networks; these changes are non-uniform, systematic, and depend on
the geometry of the brain. The composition of the largest connected network
component is also affected in a way that artificially increases the similarity
of the networks of different subjects. Our conclusion is that wherever
possible, spatial smoothing should be avoided when preprocessing fMRI data for
network analysis.

an optical soft mode from the Brillouin-zone boundary [$q =

spectra below $T_c$ and it hardens according to the Cochran law. Upon cooling
below $T_c$, the permittivity exhibits an unusual linear increase with

is an additional singlet scalar mediator that mixes with the SM Higgs boson,
which produces significant observable differences. After careful investigation

find the signal with hadronically decaying $Z$ boson provides a better search

fermion DM model as a benchmark scenario, when the DM-mediator coupling
$g_\chi$ is relatively small, the DM signals are discoverable only for
benchmark points with relatively light scalar mediator $H_2$. And the spin
discriminating from scalar DM is always promising while it is difficult to

CERN LHC is presently equipped with Multi Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs). A
gating grid prevents ions produced during the gas amplification from moving
into the drift volume. The maximum drift time of the electrons together with
the closure time of the gating grid allows a maximum readout rate of about 3
kHz. After the Long Shutdown 2 (from 2021 onwards), the LHC will provide
lead-lead collisions at an expected interaction rate of 50 kHz. To take data at
this rate the TPC will be upgraded with new readout chambers, allowing for
continuous read-out and preserving the energy and momentum resolution of the
current MWPCs.
  Chambers with a stack of four Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) fulfil all the
performance requirements, if the voltages applied to the GEMs are tuned
properly. In order to ensure that these chambers are stable while being
operated at the LHC, studies of the discharge behaviour were performed. We
report on studies done with small prototypes equipped with one or two GEMs.
Discharges were voluntarily induced by a combination of high-voltages across
the GEM(s) and highly ionising particles. During these studies, the phenomenon
of ""secondary discharges"" has been observed. These occur only after an initial
discharge when the electric field above or below the GEM is high enough. The
time between the initial and the secondary discharge ranges from several 10 us
to less than 1 us, decreasing with increasing field. Using decoupling resistors
in the high-voltage supply path of the bottom side of the GEM shifts the
occurrence of these discharges to higher electric fields.

partial differential equations (PDEs) can describe the two main branches of
continuum mechanics, fluid dynamics, and solid dynamics. The fundamental
difference from the classical continuum models, such as the Navier-Stokes for
example, is that the finite length scale of the continuum particles is not
ignored but kept in the model in order to semi-explicitly describe the essence
of any flows, that is the process of continuum particles rearrangements. To
allow the continuum particle rearrangements, we admit the deformability of
particle which is described by the distortion field. The ability of media to
flow is characterized by the strain dissipation time which is a characteristic
time necessary for a continuum particle to rearrange with one of its
neighboring particles. It is shown that the continuum particle length scale is
intimately connected with the dissipation time. The governing equations are
represented by a system of first order hyperbolic PDEs with source terms
modeling the dissipation due to particle rearrangements. Numerical examples
justifying the reliability of the proposed approach are demonstrated.

continua of different metallic and insulating solutions are obtained. The

ionizing radiation. The goal of this study is to quantify the effects of soft
X-rays (0.1 - 2 keV), a component of stellar radiation fields illuminating
protoplanetary disks, on the refractory organics present in the disks. We
prepared tholins, nitrogen-rich complex organics, via plasma deposition and
used synchrotron radiation to simulate X-ray fluences in protoplanetary disks.
Controlled irradiation experiments at 0.5 and 1.3 keV were performed at the
SEXTANTS beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron, and were followed by ex-situ
infrared, Raman and isotopic diagnostics. Infrared spectroscopy revealed the
loss of singly-bonded groups (N-H, C-H and R-N$\equiv$C) and the formation of
sp$^3$ carbon defects. Raman analysis revealed the introduction of defects and
structural amorphization. Finally, tholins were measured via secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS), revealing that significant D-enrichment is induced by
X-ray irradiation. Our results are compared to previous experimental studies
involving the thermal degradation and electron irradiation of organics. The
penetration depth of soft X-rays in $\mu$m-sized tholins leads to volume rather
than surface modifications: lower energy X-rays (0.5 keV) induce a larger
D-enrichment than 1.3 keV X-rays, reaching a plateau for doses larger than 5
$\times$ 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-3}$. Our work provides experimental evidence of a
new non-thermal pathway to deuterium fractionation of organic matter.

under-determined, or ill-conditioned, linear systems of equations. When dealing
with real-world data, the presence of outliers and impulsive noise must also be
accounted for. In past decades, the vast majority of robust linear regression
estimators has focused on robustness against rowwise contamination. Even so
called `high breakdown' estimators rely on the assumption that a majority of
rows of the regression matrix is not affected by outliers. Only very recently,
the first cellwise robust regression estimation methods have been developed. In
this paper, we define robust oracle properties, which an estimator must have in
order to perform robust model selection for under-determined, or
ill-conditioned linear regression models that are contaminated by cellwise
outliers in the regression matrix. We propose and analyze a robustly weighted
and adaptive Lasso type regularization term which takes into account cellwise
outliers for model selection. The proposed regularization term is integrated
into the objective function of the MM-estimator, which yields the proposed
MM-Robust Weighted Adaptive Lasso (MM-RWAL), for which we prove that at least
the weak robust oracle properties hold. A performance comparison to existing
robust Lasso estimators is provided using Monte Carlo experiments. Further, the
MM-RWAL is applied to determine the temporal releases of the European Tracer
Experiment (ETEX) at the source location. This ill-conditioned linear inverse
problem contains cellwise and rowwise outliers and is sparse both in the
regression matrix and the parameter vector. The proposed RWAL penalty is not
limited to the MM-estimator but can easily be integrated into the objective
function of other robust estimators.

contracting sinoatrial (SA) node cells isolated from rabbit and guinea pig and
developed a new algorithm capable of detecting and analyzing the LCRs spatially
in two-dimensions, and in time. Our algorithm tracks points along the midline
of the contracting cell. It uses these points as a coordinate system for affine
transform, producing a transformed image series where the cell does not
contract. Action potential-induced Ca transients and LCRs were thereafter
isolated from recording noise by applying a series of spatial filters. The LCR
birth and death events were detected by a differential (frame-to-frame)
sensitivity algorithm. An LCR was detected when its signal changes sufficiently
quickly within a sufficiently large area. The LCR is considered to have died
when its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising
whole cell Ca transient. Our algorithm provides major LCR parameters such as
period, signal mass, duration, and path area. As LCRs propagate within cells,
the algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the
importance of Ca-induced-Ca-release for the fate of LCRs and for generating a
powerful ensemble Ca signal. Thus, our new computer algorithms eliminate motion

  Reconciliation Maps",,,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the absence of horizontal gene transfer it is possible to reconstruct the
history of gene families from empirically determined orthology relations, which
are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees. Knowledge of the event labels
considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species
trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the
event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled
case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here
we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation
problem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency
for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a
convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of
time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak
conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which
evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an
O(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent
reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit
timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking
whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The combinatorial characterization
of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an
important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal
transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees.
The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context
because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree
reconciliation problems.

simulate an acoustic well stimulation (AWS) method for enhancing the

method considered herein aims to exploit the well-known permeability-enhancing
effect of mechanical vibrations in acoustically porous materials, by
transmitting time-harmonic sound waves from a sound source device---placed
inside the well---to the well perforations made into the formation. The
efficiency of the AWS is assessed by quantifying the amount of acoustic energy
transmitted from the source device to the rock formation in terms of the
emission frequency and the well configuration. A simple methodology to find
optimal emission frequencies for a given well configuration is presented. The
proposed model is based on the Helmholtz equation and an impedance boundary
condition that effectively accounts for the porous solid-fluid interaction at
the interface between the rock formation and the well perforations. Exact
non-reflecting boundary conditions derived from Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are
utilized to truncate the circular cylindrical waveguides considered in the
model. The resulting boundary value problem is then numerically solved by means
of the finite element method. A variety of numerical examples are presented in

(FDI) is one of the main features of globalization. In this paper we
investigate the effects of FDI on trade from a network perspective, since FDI
takes not only direct but also indirect channels from origin to destination
countries because of firms' incentive to reduce tax burden, to minimize
coordination costs, and to break barriers to market entry. We use a unique data
set of international corporate control as a measure of stock FDI to construct a
corporate control network (CCN) where the nodes are the countries and the edges
are the corporate control relationships. Based on the CCN, the network
measures, i.e., the shortest path length and the communicability, are computed
to capture the indirect channel of FDI. Empirically we find that corporate
control has a positive effect on trade both directly and indirectly. The result
is robust with different specifications and estimation strategies. Hence, our
paper provides strong empirical evidence of the indirect effects of FDI on
trade. Moreover, we identify a number of interplaying factors such as regional
trade agreements and the region of Asia. We also find that the indirect effects
are more pronounced for manufacturing sectors than for primary sectors such as
oil extraction and agriculture.

Numerical simulations to support experimental signatures of cooperative

systematic numerical studies aimed at matching the regime of dilute atomic

We also illustrate the cooperative nature of light scattering by considering an

applied in the near edge region at the K-and L1-edges in solids. Computation of
circular dichroism requires precise calculations of X-ray absorption spectra
(XAS) for circularly polarized light. For the derivation of the XAS cross
section, we used a relativistic description of the photon-electron interaction
that results in an additional term in the cross-section that couples the
electric dipole operator with an operator $\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot
(\mathbf{\epsilon} \times \mathbf{r})$ that we name spin-position. The
numerical method relies on pseudopotentials, on the gauge including projected
augmented wave method and on a collinear spin relativistic description of the
electronic structure. We apply the method to the calculations of K-edge XMCD
spectra of ferromagnetic iron, cobalt and nickel and of I L1-edge XNCD spectra
of $\alpha$-LiIO3, a compound with broken inversion symmetry. For XMCD spectra
we find that, even if the electric dipole term is the dominant one, the
electric quadrupole term is not negligible (8% in amplitude in the case of
iron). The term coupling the electric dipole operator with the spin-position
operator is significant (28% in amplitude in the case of iron). We obtain a
sum-rule relating this new term to the spin magnetic moment of the p-states. In
$\alpha$-LiIO3 we recover the expected angular dependence of the XNCD spectra.

related to the spiral structure is supposed to affect the local kinematics of
the star-forming regions. Part of the Perseus arm, between galactic longitudes
from 85deg to 124deg, does not contain blue-shifted masers at all. Radial
velocities of the sources are the greatest in this particular part of the arm,
so the velocity difference is clearly pronounced. 13CO(1-0) and CS(2-1)

of the cosmic-ray flux in and around the solar system obtained by Voyager and
AMS-02 or PAMELA. We find that the average cosmic-ray spectrum in the local
Galaxy in the 1-100 GeV range is well described by a broken power-law in
rigidity with a low-energy slope of $2.33^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ and a break at
$18^{+7}_{-4}$ GV, with a slope change by $0.59\pm 0.11$. This result is
consistent with an earlier analysis of the gamma-ray signal from the Gould Belt
clouds based on a shorter exposure of Fermi/LAT and with a different event
selection. The break at 10-20 GV is also consistent with the combined Voyager +
AMS-02 measurements in/around the solar system. The slope of the spectrum below
the break agrees with the slope of the average cosmic-ray spectrum in the inner
part of the disk of the Milky Way that was previously derived from the
Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data. We conjecture that it is this slope of 2.33 and not
the locally measured softer slope of 2.7-2.8 that is determined by the balance
between a steady-state injection of cosmic rays with a power-law slope of 2-2.1
that is due to Fermi acceleration and the energy-dependent propagation of
cosmic-ray particles through the turbulent interstellar magnetic field with a
Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum. The approximation of a continuous-in-time
injection of cosmic rays at a constant rate breaks down, which causes the
softening of the spectrum at higher energies.

interactions (pile-up) is crucial for a variety of physics analyses at the LHC,
including Standard Model measurements and searches for physics beyond the
Standard Model. The identification of such jets is challenging due to the lack
of track and vertex information in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|>2.5$. This
paper presents a novel strategy for forward pile-up jet tagging that exploits
jet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions.
Measurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set
of 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13
TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of pile-up jets rejected in
the range $2.5<|\eta|<4.5$ is estimated in simulated events with an average of
22 interactions per bunch-crossing. It increases with jet transverse momentum
and, for jets with transverse momentum between 20 and 50 GeV, it ranges between
49% and 67% with an efficiency of 85% for selecting hard-scatter jets. A case
study is performed in Higgs boson production via the vector-boson fusion

the teleportation fidelity is almost completely protected. It is intriguing to

bright X-ray quasar behind the Coma cluster, to study the properties of the
warm-hot intergalactic medium in the vicinity of the nearest massive galaxy
cluster. The RGS observations confirm the possible presence of a Ne IX K-alpha
absorption line at the redshift of Coma, although with a limited statistical
significance. This analysis is therefore in line with the earlier analysis by
Takei et al. (2007) based on a sub-set of these data. Its large column density
and optical depth, however, point to implausible conditions for the absorbing
medium, thereby casting serious doubts to its reality. Chandra has never
observed X Comae and therefore cannot provide additional information on this
source. We combine upper limits to the presence of other X-ray absorption lines
(notably from O VII and O VIII) at the redshift of Coma with positive
measurements of the soft excess emission from Coma measured by ROSAT (Bonamente
et al. 2003). The combination of emission from warm-hot gas at kT~1/4 keV and
upper limits from absorption lines provide useful constraints on the density
and the sightline length of the putative WHIM towards Coma. We conclude that
the putative warm-hot medium towards Coma is consistent with expected
properties, with a baryon overdensity >=10 and a sightline extent of order of
tens of Mpc.

semimetals, no interband optical transition could be induced and the only
contribution to the optical conductivity arises from the intraband excitations.
The corresponding Drude weight is independent of the carrier density at low
carrier concentrations and linearly increases with chemical potential at high
carrier doping.

only have a very basic understanding of the complications of collating,

practices, missing values, inconvenient storage mechanisms, intellectual
property, security and privacy. All these aspects obstruct the sharing and
interconnection of data, and the eventual interpretation of data through
machine learning or other approaches. In project reporting, a major challenge
is in encapsulating these problems and enabling goals to be built around the
processing of data. Project overruns can occur due to failure to account for
the amount of time required to curate and collate. But to understand these
failures we need to have a common language for assessing the readiness of a
particular data set. This position paper proposes the use of data readiness
levels: it gives a rough outline of three stages of data preparedness and
speculates on how formalisation of these levels into a common language for data
readiness could facilitate project management.

been synthesized within double-walled carbon nanotubes, and they show a
promising new route to one--atom--wide semiconductors with a direct band gap.
Theoretical studies predicted that this band gap can be tuned by the length of
the chains, the end groups, and their interactions with the environment.
However, different density functionals lead to very different values of the
band gap of infinitely long carbyne. In this work, we applied resonant Raman
excitation spectroscopy with more than 50 laser wavelengths to determine for
the first time the band gap of long carbon chains encapsulated inside DWCNTs.
The experimentally determined band gaps ranging from 2.253 to 1.848 eV follow a
linear relation with Raman frequency. This lower bound is the smallest band gap
of linear carbon chains observed so far. The comparison with experimental data
obtained for short chains in gas phase or in solution demonstrates the effect
of the DWCNT encapsulation, leading to an essential downshift of the band gap.
This is explained by the interaction between the carbon chain and the host
tube, which greatly modifies the chain's bond length alternation.

supersonic speeds and are promising sources of non-thermal emission of photons.
One of these objects has been found to emit non-thermal radiation in the radio
band. This triggered the development of theoretical models predicting
non-thermal photons from radio up to very-high-energy (VHE, E $\geq 0.1$TeV)
gamma rays. Subsequently, one bow shock was also detected in X-ray
observations. However, the data did not allow discrimination between a hot
thermal and a non-thermal origin. Further observations of different candidates
at X-ray energies showed no evidence for emission at the position of the bow
shocks either. A systematic search in the \textit{Fermi}-LAT energy regime
resulted in flux upper limits for 27 candidates listed in the E-BOSS catalogue.
Here we perform the first systematic search for VHE gamma-ray emission from bow
shocks of runaway stars. Using all available archival H.E.S.S. data we search
for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission at the positions of bow shock
candidates listed in the second E-BOSS catalogue release. Out of the 73 bow
shock candidates in this catalogue, 32 have been observed with H.E.S.S. None of
the observed 32 bow shock candidates in this population study show significant
emission in the H.E.S.S. energy range. Therefore, flux upper limits are
calculated in five energy bins and the fraction of the kinetic wind power that
is converted into VHE gamma rays is constrained. Emission from stellar bow
shocks is not detected in the energy range between 0.14 and 18 TeV. The
resulting upper limits constrain the level of VHE gamma-ray emission from these
objects down to 0.1-1 % of the kinetic wind energy.

  Version)","Extended version with proofs for a paper to appear at ECOOP 2017",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effect systems are lightweight extensions to type systems that can verify a
wide range of important properties with modest developer burden. But our
general understanding of effect systems is limited primarily to systems where
the order of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms of a
lattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential issues, and provides
guidance when designing new effect systems. By contrast, sequential effect
systems --- where the order of effects is important --- lack a clear algebraic
characterization.
  We derive an algebraic characterization from the shape of prior concrete
sequential effect systems. We present an abstract polymorphic effect system
with singleton effects parameterized by an effect quantale --- an algebraic
structure with well-defined properties that can model a range of existing
order-sensitive effect systems. We define effect quantales, derive useful
properties, and show how they cleanly model a variety of known sequential
effect systems. We show that effect quantales provide a free, general notion of
iterating a sequential effect, and that for systems we consider the derived
iteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators in prior work.
Identifying and applying the right algebraic structure led us to subtle
insights into the design of order-sensitive effect systems, which provides
guidance on non-obvious points of designing order-sensitive effect systems.
Effect quantales have clear relationships to the recent category theoretic work
on order-sensitive effect systems, but are explained without recourse to
category theory. In addition, our derived iteration construct should generalize
to these semantic structures, addressing limitations of that work.

showed that there exists a small constant $\epsilon$, such that it is
PPAD-complete to find an (unconstrained) $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium of a

hold even for planar bipartite polymatrix games with degree 3 and at most 7
strategies per player, and all non-trivial approximation guarantees. These
results stand in contrast to similar results for bimatrix games, which
obviously need a non-constant number of actions, and which rely on stronger
complexity-theoretic conjectures such as the exponential time hypothesis. In
the second part, we provide a deterministic QPTAS for interaction graphs with
bounded treewidth and with logarithmically many actions per player that can
compute constrained approximate equilibria for a wide family of constraints

the D-Wave 2X machine. Motivated by a recently proposed graph-based electronic
structure theory applied to quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations, graph
partitioning is used for reducing the calculation of the density matrix into
smaller subsystems rendering the calculation more computationally efficient.
Unconstrained graph partitioning as community clustering based on the
modularity metric can be naturally mapped into the Hamiltonian of the quantum
annealer. On the other hand, when constraints are imposed for partitioning into
equal parts and minimizing the number of cut edges between parts, a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) reformulation is required. This
reformulation may employ the graph complement to fit the problem in the Chimera
graph of the quantum annealer. Partitioning into 2 parts, 2^N parts
recursively, and k parts concurrently are demonstrated with benchmark graphs,
random graphs, and small material system density matrix based graphs. Results
for graph partitioning using quantum and hybrid classical-quantum approaches
are shown to equal or out-perform current ""state of the art"" methods.

most biological and technological processes. In particular, within the current
trend towards the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, microscopic
engines have been attracting an ever-increasing interest. On the one hand,
there has been a quest to understand how biological molecular motors work. On
the other hand, several approaches have been proposed to realize artificial
microscopic engines, which have been powered by the transfer of light momentum,
by external magnetic fields, by in situ chemical reactions, or by the energy
flow between hot and cold heat reservoirs, in scaled-down versions of
macroscopic heat engines. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a microscopic
engine powered by the local reversible demixing of a critical mixture. We show
that, when an absorbing microsphere is optically trapped by a focused laser
beam in a sub-critical mixture, it is set into rotation around the optical axis
of the beam because of the emergence of diffusiophoretic propulsion; this
behavior can be controlled by adjusting the optical power, the temperature, and
the criticality of the mixture. Given its simplicity, this microscopic engine
provides a powerful tool to power micro- and nanodevices. Furthermore, since
many biological systems are tuned near criticality, this mechanism might
already be at work within living organisms, for example in proteins and in
cellular membranes.

for investigating the question ""What is life?"", the most fundamental problem of
biology. Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem
surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical
models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect
underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships
between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto ""throw away
the physics, keep the organisation"". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic
models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might
have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own
work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M,R)
systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach
could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the
mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate
to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a
particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions
rather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The
strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison
with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's
definition of life, ""organisms are closed to efficient causation"", should be
considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be
implemented in mathematical models are presented.

concept. Sustainable growth of platform ecosystems is enabled by platform users

Serious concern is increasing about data misuse or abuse, privacy issues and
revenue sharing between the different stakeholders. Traditional data governance
focuses on generic goals and a universal approach to manage the data of an
enterprise. It entails limited support for the complicated situation and
relationship of a platform ecosystem where multiple participating parties
contribute, use data and share profits. This article identifies data governance
factors for platform ecosystems through literature review. The study then
surveys the data governance state of practice of four platform ecosystems:
Facebook, YouTube, EBay and Uber. Finally, 19 governance models in industry and

that it manifests itself as dark energy. At the start of the cosmological

cosmological acceleration of such an empty space-time can manifests itself as
inflation. To get the de Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty space-time
under influence of scalar fields and classical and quantum gravitational waves,
one needs to make a mandatory Wick rotation, i.e. one needs to make a
transition to the Euclidean space of imaginary time. One can assume that the
very existence of inflation and dark energy could be considered as a possible
observable evidence of the fact that time by its nature could be a complex

systems. In this paper, we describe a new technique-called Series Expansion
with Accelerated Gradient Descent on Lippmann-Schwinger Equation (SEAGLE)-for
robust imaging under multiple scattering based on a combination of a new
nonlinear forward model and a total variation (TV) regularizer. The proposed
forward model can account for multiple scattering, which makes it advantageous
in applications where linear models are inaccurate. Specifically, it
corresponds to a series expansion of the scattered wave with an
accelerated-gradient method. This expansion guarantees the convergence even for
strongly scattering objects. One of our key insights is that it is possible to
obtain an explicit formula for computing the gradient of our nonlinear forward
model with respect to the unknown object, thus enabling fast image
reconstruction with the state-of-the-art fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding
algorithm (FISTA). The proposed method is validated on both simulated and

the objective aspects of face perception have been extensively studied,
relatively fewer computational models have been developed for the social
impressions of faces. Bridging this gap, we develop a method to predict human
impressions of faces in 40 subjective social dimensions, using deep
representations from state-of-the-art neural networks. We find that model
performance grows as the human consensus on a face trait increases, and that
model predictions outperform human groups in correlation with human averages.
This illustrates the learnability of subjective social perception of faces,
especially when there is high human consensus. Our system can be used to decide
which photographs from a personal collection will make the best impression. The
results are significant for the field of social robotics, demonstrating that
robots can learn the subjective judgments defining the underlying fabric of

between the chemical composition of the ISM and molecular composition of the

molecules in ISM will firmly establish this link. In the light of this, we have
considered C5H9N isomeric group in which the next higher member of the alkyl
cyanide and other branched chain isomers belong. High-level quantum chemical
calculations have been employed in estimating accurate energies of these
isomers. From the results, the only isomer of the group that has been
astronomically searched, n-butyl cyanide is not the most stable isomer and
therefore, which might explain why its search could only yield upper limits of
its column density without a successful detection. Rather, the two most stable
isomers of the group are the branched chain isomers, tert-butylnitrile and
isobutyl cyanide. Based on the rotational constants of these isomers, it is
found that the expected intensity of tert-butylnitrile is the maximum among
this isomeric group. Thus, this is proposed as the most probable candidate for
astronomical observation. A simple LTE (Local thermodynamic equilibrium)
modelling has also been carried out to check the possibility of detecting
tert-butyl cyanide in the millimetre-wave region.
