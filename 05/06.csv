  Algorithm",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the stochastic matching problem, we are given a general (not necessarily
bipartite) graph $G(V,E)$, where each edge in $E$ is realized with some
constant probability $p > 0$ and the goal is to compute a bounded-degree
(bounded by a function depending only on $p$) subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that the
expected maximum matching size in $H$ is close to the expected maximum matching
size in $G$. The algorithms in this setting are considered non-adaptive as they
have to choose the subgraph $H$ without knowing any information about the set
of realized edges in $G$. Originally motivated by an application to kidney
exchange, the stochastic matching problem and its variants have received
significant attention in recent years.
  The state-of-the-art non-adaptive algorithms for stochastic matching achieve
an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$,
naturally raising the question that if $1/2$ is the limit of what can be
achieved with a non-adaptive algorithm. In this work, we resolve this question
by presenting the first algorithm for stochastic matching with an approximation
guarantee that is strictly better than $1/2$: the algorithm computes a subgraph
$H$ of $G$ with the maximum degree $O(\frac{\log{(1/ p)}}{p})$ such that the
ratio of expected size of a maximum matching in realizations of $H$ and $G$ is
at least $1/2+\delta_0$ for some absolute constant $\delta_0 > 0$. The degree
bound on $H$ achieved by our algorithm is essentially the best possible (up to
an $O(\log{(1/p)})$ factor) for any constant factor approximation algorithm,
since an $\Omega(\frac{1}{p})$ degree in $H$ is necessary for a vertex to
acquire at least one incident edge in a realization.

also evaluated against the new Q-factor bound for small antennas at a given

radiation efficiency of -6.5 dB at 876 MHz. An intermediate directivity of 6.2

efficiency. The antenna performs well with respect to the developed fundamental

galaxies. It can unveil a great deal of information about the lenses dark
matter content when combined with the study of the lenses light profile.
However, gravitational lensing galaxies, by definition, appear surrounded by
point-like and diffuse lensed signal that is irrelevant to the lens flux.
Therefore, the observer is most often restricted to studying the innermost
portions of the galaxy, where classical fitting methods show some
instabilities. We aim at subtracting that lensed signal and at characterising
some lenses light profile by computing their shape parameters. Our objective is
to evaluate the total integrated flux in an aperture the size of the Einstein
ring in order to obtain a robust estimate of the quantity of ordinary matter in
each system. We are expanding the work we started in a previous paper that
consisted in subtracting point-like lensed images and in independently
measuring each shape parameter. We improve it by designing a subtraction of the
diffuse lensed signal, based only on one simple hypothesis of symmetry. This
extra step improves our study of the shape parameters and we refine it even
more by upgrading our half-light radius measurement. We also calculate the
impact of our specific image processing on the error bars. The diffuse lensed
signal subtraction makes it possible to study a larger portion of relevant
galactic flux, as the radius of the fitting region increases by on average
17\%. We retrieve new half-light radii values that are on average 11\% smaller
than in our previous work, although the uncertainties overlap in most cases.
This shows that not taking the diffuse lensed signal into account may lead to a
significant overestimate of the half-light radius. We are also able to measure
the flux within the Einstein radius and to compute secure error bars to all of
our results.

proposed in the past two decades, striking different tradeoffs between
scalability, accuracy and complexity of the resulting models. However, these
methods have been evaluated in an ad-hoc manner, employing different datasets,
experimental setups, evaluation measures and baselines, often leading to
incomparable conclusions and sometimes unreproducible results due to the use of
closed datasets. This article provides a systematic review and comparative
evaluation of automated process discovery methods, using an open-source
benchmark and covering twelve publicly-available real-life event logs, twelve
proprietary real-life event logs, and nine quality metrics. The results
highlight gaps and unexplored tradeoffs in the field, including the lack of

than regular symmetries. In this paper, we study the nature of a correspondence
between sub-symmetries and conservation laws of a differential system. We show
that for a large class of non-Lagrangian systems, there is a natural
association between sub-symmetries and local conservation laws based on the
Noether operator identity, and we prove an analogue of the first Noether
Theorem for sub-symmetries. We also demonstrate that infinite conservation laws
containing arbitrary functions of dependent variables can be generated by
infinite sub-symmetries through the Noether operator identity. We discuss the
application of sub-symmetries to the incompressible Euler equations of fluid
dynamics. Despite the fact that infinite symmetries (with arbitrary functions
of dependent variables) are not known for the Euler equations, we show that
these equations possess infinite sub-symmetries. We calculate infinite
sub-symmetries with arbitrary functions of dependent variables for the two-and
three-dimensional Euler equations in the velocity and vorticity formulations

studies that have already been done in that direction. The first one
investigates what can be expected in the case of maximum allowed intergalactic
magnetic fields. Here is shown that, even if voids contain strong magnetic
fields, deflections of protons with energies $\gtrsim 60 \; \text{EeV}$ from
nearby sources might be small enough to allow for UHECR astronomy. The second
study looks into several scenarios with a smaller magnetization focusing on
large-scale anisotropies. Here is shown that the local source distribution can
have a more significant effect on the large-scale anisotropy than the EGMF
model. A significant dipole component could, for instance, be explained by a
dominant source within 5 Mpc distance. The third study looks into whether
UHECRs can come from local radio galaxies. If this is the case it is difficult
to reproduce the observed low level of anisotropy. Therefore is concluded that
the magnetic field strength in voids in the EGMF model used here is too low

for different models of scalar channels. It was shown that, over $n$
independent channel uses, $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits can transmitted reliably
over a public channel while achieving an arbitrarily low probability of
detection (LPD) by other stations. This result is well known as square-root law
and even to achieve this diminishing rate of covert communication, some form of
shared secret is needed between the transmitter and the receiver. In this
paper, we establish the limits of LPD communication over the MIMO AWGN channel.
We define the notion of $\epsilon$-probability of detection ($\epsilon$-PD) and
provide a formulation to evaluate the maximum achievable rate under the
$\epsilon$-PD constraint. We first show that the capacity-achieving input
distribution is the zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Then, assuming channel
state information (CSI) on only the main channel at the transmitter, we derive
the optimal input covariance matrix, hence, establishing the $\epsilon$-PD
capacity. We evaluate $\epsilon$-PD rates in the limiting regimes for the
number of channel uses (asymptotic block length) and the number of antennas
(massive MIMO). We show that, in the asymptotic block-length regime, while the
SRL still holds for the MIMO AWGN, the number of bits that can be transmitted
covertly scales exponentially with the number of transmitting antennas.
Further, we derive the $\epsilon$-PD capacity \textit{with no shared secret}.
For that scenario, in the massive MIMO limit, higher covert rate up to the non
LPD constrained capacity still can be achieved, yet, with much slower scaling
compared to the scenario with shared secret. The practical implication of our
result is that, MIMO has the potential to provide a substantial increase in the
file sizes that can be covertly communicated subject to a reasonably low delay.

known that inhomogeneities of the Klein-Gordon field are unstable above the

instability implies the existence of a threshold amplitude for the collapse of
primordial fluctuations. We use this threshold to correctly predict the
cut--off scale of the matter power spectrum in the scalar field dark matter
model. Furthermore, for a Klein-Gordon field during reheating we show that this
same threshold allows for abundant production of structure (oscillons but not
necessarily black holes). Looking at the production of Primordial Black Holes
(PBHs) in this scenario we note that the sphericity condition yields a much
lower probability of PBH formation at the end of inflation. Remarkably, even
after meeting such stringent condition, we find that PBHs may be overproduced
during reheating. We finally constrain the epochs at which an oscillating
Klein-Gordon field could dominate the early universe.

two-body interactions that bring the systems to a state of partial energy
equipartition. Using a set of Monte Carlo clusters simulations, we investigate
the role of the onset of energy equipartition in shaping the mass-to-light
ratio (M/L) in GCs. Our simulations show that the M/L profiles cannot be
considered constant and their specific shape strongly depends on the dynamical
age of the clusters. Dynamically younger clusters display a central peak up to
M/L $\simeq25$ $M_\odot/L_\odot$ caused by the retention of dark remnants; this
peak flattens out for dynamically older clusters. Moreover, we find that also
the global values of M/L correlate with the dynamical state of a cluster
quantified as either the number of relaxation times a system has experienced
$n_{rel}$ or the equipartition parameter $m_{eq}$: clusters closer to full
equipartition (higher $n_{rel}$ or lower $m_{eq}$) display a lower M/L. We show
that the decrease of M/L is primarily driven by the dynamical ejection of dark
remnants, rather than by the escape of low-mass stars. The predictions of our
models are in good agreement with observations of GCs in the Milky Way and M31,
indicating that differences in relaxation state alone can explain variations of
M/L up to a factor of $\simeq3$. Our characterization of the M/L as a function
of relaxation state is of primary relevance for the application and

slow strain rate of the order of $10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$, and released
intermittently at intervals $>100$ years, in the form of rapid (seconds to
minutes) coseismic ruptures. The development of macroscopic models of
quasi-static planar tectonic dynamics at these plate boundaries has remained
challenging due to uncertainty with regard to the spatial and kinematic
complexity of fault system behaviors. In particular, the characteristic length
scale of kinematically distinct tectonic structures is poorly constrained. Here
we analyze fluctuations in GPS recordings of interseismic velocities from the
southern California plate boundary, identifying heavy-tailed scaling behavior.
This suggests that the plate boundary can be understood as a densely packed

$N$ conformal field theory: given the appearance of a single-trace operator in
the ${\cal O}\times{\cal O}$ OPE of a scalar primary ${\cal O}$, what is its
total contribution to the vacuum four-point function $\langle {\cal O}{\cal
O}{\cal O}{\cal O}\rangle$ as dictated by crossing symmetry? We solve this
problem in 4d conformal field theories at leading order in $1/N$. Viewed
holographically, this provides a field theory reconstruction of
crossing-symmetric, four-point exchange amplitudes in AdS$_5$. Our solution
takes the form of a resummation of the large spin solution to the crossing
equations, supplemented by corrections at finite spin, required by crossing.
The method can be applied to the exchange of operators of arbitrary twist
$\tau$ and spin $s$, although it vastly simplifies for even-integer twist,
where we give explicit results. The output is the set of OPE data for the
exchange of all double-trace operators $[{\cal O}{\cal O}]_{n,\ell}$. We find
that the double-trace anomalous dimensions $\gamma_{n,\ell}$ are negative,
monotonic and convex functions of $\ell$, for all $n$ and all $\ell>s$. This

frequently used in cosmology, and must be well understood if we are to make
precise inferences about fundamental physics from cosmological observations. We
investigate this problem by calculating redshifts and luminosity distances

to allow for large density contrasts on small scales. Our study of optics is
then achieved by propagating one hundred thousand null geodesics through such

our ray tracing results faithfully reproduces the expectations from FLRW
cosmology. When opaque objects with sizes similar to those of galactic bulges
are introduced, however, we find that the mean of distance measures can be
shifted up from FLRW predictions by as much as $10\%$. This bias is due to the
viable photon trajectories being restricted by the presence of the opaque
objects, which means that they cannot probe the regions of space-time with the
highest curvature. It corresponds to a positive bias of order $10\%$ in the
estimation of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and highlights the important consequences that

landscapes, specifically focusing on stochastic slow promoter kinetics, a time
scale relevant when transcription factor binding and unbinding are affected by
epigenetic processes like DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. In this
case, largely unexplored except for numerical simulations, adiabatic

triples that harbour planets. Examples are hot Jupiters (HJs) in stellar triple
systems, and planetary companions to HJs in stellar binaries. The secular
dynamical evolution of these systems is generally complex, with secular chaotic
motion possible in certain parameter regimes. The latter can lead to extremely
high eccentricities and, therefore, strong interactions such as efficient tidal
evolution. These interactions are believed to play an important role in the
formation of HJs through high-eccentricity migration. Nevertheless, a deeper
understanding of the secular dynamics of these systems is still lacking. Here
we study in detail the secular dynamics of a special case of hierarchical
quadruple systems in either the `2+2' or `3+1' configurations. We show how the
equations of motion can be cast in a form representing a perturbed hierarchical
three-body system, in which the outer orbital angular momentum vector is
precessing steadily around a fixed axis. In this case, we show that
eccentricity excitation can be significantly enhanced when the precession
period is comparable to the Lidov-Kozai oscillation time-scale of the inner
orbit. This arises from an induced large mutual inclination between the inner
and outer orbits driven by the precession of the outer orbit, even if the
initial mutual inclination is small. We present a simplified semi-analytic
model that describes the latter phenomenon.

sub-sample of very gas rich (gas fraction > 80 per cent) sources with dust
masses significantly below predictions from simple chemical evolution models,
and well below $M_d/M_*$ and $M_d/M_{gas}$ scaling relations seen in dust and
stellar-selected samples of local galaxies. We use a chemical evolution model
to explain these dust-poor, but gas-rich, sources as well as the observed star
formation rates (SFRs) and dust-to-gas ratios. We find that (i) a delayed star
formation history is required to model the observed SFRs; (ii) inflows and
outflows are required to model the observed metallicities at low gas fractions;
(iii) a reduced contribution of dust from supernovae (SNe) is needed to explain
the dust-poor sources with high gas fractions. These dust-poor, low stellar
mass galaxies require a typical core-collapse SN to produce 0.01 - 0.16
$M_{\odot}$ of dust. To match the observed dust masses at lower gas fractions,
significant grain growth is required to counteract the reduced contribution
from dust in SNe and dust destruction from SN shocks. These findings are
statistically robust, though due to intrinsic scatter it is not always possible
to find one single model that successfully describes all the data. We also show
that the dust-to-metals ratio decreases towards lower metallicity.

visibility accuracy of better than 0.25 %, and spectro-differential phase and
closure phase accuracy better than 0.5{\deg}, corresponding to a differential
astrometric precision of better than 10 microarcseconds ({\mu}as). The
dual-beam astrometry, measuring the phase difference of two objects with laser
metrology, is still under commissioning. First observations show residuals as
low as 50 {\mu}as when following objects over several months. We illustrate the
instrument performance with the observations of archetypical objects for the
different instrument modes. Examples include the Galactic Center supermassive
black hole and its fast orbiting star S2 for phase referenced dual beam
observations and infrared wavefront sensing, the High Mass X-Ray Binary BP Cru

virial scale factor f, allowing us to compute individual f factors for each
target. Our results nearly double the number of targets that have been modeled
in this manner, and investigate the properties of a more diverse sample by
including previously modeled objects. We measure an average scale factor f in
the entire sample to be log10(f) = 0.54 +/- 0.17 when the line dispersion is
used to characterize the line width, which is consistent with values derived
using the normalization of the MBH-sigma relation. We find that the scale

inclination angle, and opening angle of the broad line region but we do not
find any correlation with the luminosity.

streaming velocity that is as large as three times the root-mean-squared value
is effective at suppressing the formation of H$_{2}$-cooled minihaloes, while
still allowing larger atomic cooling haloes (ACHs) to form. We find that enough
H$_{2}$ forms in the centre of these ACHs to effectively cool the gas,
demonstrating that a high streaming velocity by itself cannot produce the
conditions required for DCBH formation. However, we argue that high streaming
velocity regions do provide an ideal environment for the formation of DCBHs in
close pairs of ACHs (the ""synchronised halo"" model). Due to the absence of star
formation in minihaloes, the gas remains chemically pristine until the ACHs
form. If two such haloes form with only a small separation in time and space,
then the one forming stars earlier can provide enough ultraviolet radiation to
suppress H$_{2}$ cooling in the other, allowing it to collapse to form a DCBH.
Baryonic streaming may therefore play a crucial role in the formation of the
seeds of the highest redshift quasars.

suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations altering the original history of
galaxy-satellite interactions at a time when the main galaxy, though already
bar-unstable, does not feature any non-axisymmetric structure yet. We find that
the main effect of a late minor merger and of a close fly-by is to delay the
time of bar formation and those two dynamical events are not directly
responsible for the development of the bar and do not alter significantly its
global properties (e.g. its final extension). We conclude that, once the disc
has grown to a mass large enough to sustain global non-axisymmetric modes, then
bar formation is inevitable.

have established a correspondence between sensitive dependence on initial
conditions and fractal basin boundaries, but much less is known about the
relation between geometry and dynamics in undriven dissipative systems. These
systems can exhibit a prevalent form of complex dynamics, dubbed doubly
transient chaos because not only typical trajectories but also the (otherwise
invariant) chaotic saddles are transient. This property, along with a manifest
lack of scale invariance, has hindered the study of the geometric properties of
basin boundaries in these systems--most remarkably, the very question of
whether they are fractal across all scales has yet to be answered. Here we
derive a general dynamical condition that answers this question, which we use
to demonstrate that the basin boundaries can indeed form a true fractal; in
fact, they do so generically in a broad class of transiently chaotic undriven
dissipative systems. Using physical examples, we demonstrate that the
boundaries typically form a slim fractal, which we define as a set whose
dimension at a given resolution decreases when the resolution is increased. To
properly characterize such sets, we introduce the notion of equivalent
dimension for quantifying their relation with sensitive dependence on initial
conditions at all scales. We show that slim fractal boundaries can exhibit
complex geometry even when they do not form a true fractal and fractal scaling
is observed only above a certain length scale at each boundary point. Thus, our
results reveal slim fractals as a geometrical hallmark of transient chaos in
undriven dissipative systems.

M-dwarfs planets is important to understanding whether life as we know it could
emerge on such worlds. In this work, we couple radiative transfer models to
observed M-dwarf spectra to determine the UV environment on prebiotic
Earth-analog planets orbiting M-dwarfs. We calculate dose rates to quantify the
impact of different host stars on prebiotically-important photoprocesses. We
find that M-dwarf planets have access to 100-1000 times less bioactive UV

prebiotically plausible pathways for pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis, could
function on M-dwarf planets. This uncertainty affects objects like the
recently-discovered habitable-zone planets orbiting Proxima Centauri,

laboratory studies can constrain this possibility as well.

periodic, with a periodicity that can be parametrically large in terms of the

principal bundle with connection whose structure 2-group is the string 2-group.
We readily write down the explicit elementary solution to our equations, which
is the categorified analogue of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. Our solution
passes all the relevant consistency checks; in particular, it is globally
defined on $\mathbb{R}^4$ and approaches the abelian self-dual string of charge
one at infinity. We note that our equations also arise as the BPS equations in
a recently proposed six-dimensional superconformal field theory and we show
that with our choice of higher gauge structure, the action of this theory can
be reduced to four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.

universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales
spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and
clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following
topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the
diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the
too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including
implications for density profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay
between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods
that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with
observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet
Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers;
(5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM

interferometer. The 3.5 hour exposure reveals a rich K-band spectrum dominated
by hydrogen Br$\gamma\ $ and \ion{He}{i} lines, as well as (red-shifted)
emission lines coming from the jets. The K-band continuum emitting region is
dominated by a marginally resolved point source ($<$ 1 mas) embedded inside a
diffuse background accounting for 10\% of the total flux. The jet line
positions agree well with the ones expected from the jet kinematic model, an
interpretation also supported by the consistent sign (i.e. negative/positive
for the receding/approaching jet component) of the phase shifts observed in the
lines. The significant visibility drop across the jet lines, together with the
small and nearly identical phases for all baselines, point toward a jet that is
offset by less than 0.5 mas from the continuum source and resolved in the
direction of propagation, with a typical size of 2 mas. The jet position angle
of $\sim$80$^{\circ}$ is consistent with the expected one at the observation
date. Jet emission so close to the central binary system would suggest that
line locking, if relevant to explain the amplitude and stability of the 0.26c
jet velocity, operates on elements heavier than hydrogen. The Br$\gamma\ $
profile is broad and double peaked. It is better resolved than the continuum
and the change of the phase signal sign across the line on all baselines
suggests an East-West oriented geometry alike the jet direction and supporting
a (polar) disk wind origin.

which the black holes inspiral to smaller separations. On the precession
timescale, the angle between the total and orbital angular momenta oscillates
with nutation period $\tau$, during which the orbital angular momentum
precesses about the total angular momentum by an angle $\alpha$. This defines
two distinct frequencies that vary on the radiation-reaction timescale: the
nutation frequency $\omega \equiv 2\pi/\tau$ and the precession frequency
$\Omega \equiv \alpha/\tau$. We use analytic solutions for generic spin
precession at 2PN order to derive Fourier series for the total and orbital
angular momenta in which each term is a sinusoid with frequency $\Omega -
n\omega$ for integer $n$. As black holes inspiral, they can pass through
nutational resonances ($\Omega = n\omega$) at which the total angular momentum
tilts. We derive an approximate expression for this tilt angle and show that it
is usually less than $10^{-3}$ radians for nutational resonances at binary
separations $r > 10M$. The large tilts occurring during transitional precession
(near zero total angular momentum) are a consequence of such states being
approximate $n=0$ nutational resonances. Our new Fourier series for the total

obeys a rather strict scaling condition, which would be very hard to fulfill in
practice. Even under this condition, the fluctuations of work and power do not
vanish in the infinite system size limit. Large fluctuations of output work
thus constitute inseparable and dominant element in performance of the
macroscopic heat engines close to a critical point.

  Latent Space Model Fitting",,,,,"stat.ME cs.SI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latent space models are effective tools for statistical modeling and
exploration of network data. These models can effectively model real world
network characteristics such as degree heterogeneity, transitivity, homophily,
etc. Due to their close connection to generalized linear models, it is also
natural to incorporate covariate information in them. The current paper
presents two universal fitting algorithms for networks with edge covariates:
one based on nuclear norm penalization and the other based on projected
gradient descent. Both algorithms are motivated by maximizing likelihood for a
special class of inner-product models while working simultaneously for a wide
range of different latent space models, such as distance models, which allow
latent vectors to affect edge formation in flexible ways. These fitting
methods, especially the one based on projected gradient descent, are fast and
scalable to large networks. We obtain their rates of convergence for both
inner-product models and beyond. The effectiveness of the modeling approach and
fitting algorithms is demonstrated on five real world network datasets for
different statistical tasks, including community detection with and without
edge covariates, and network assisted learning.

Given
the instability of its orbit, the presence of rings is surprising, and their
origin remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the dynamical history
of the Chariklo system by integrating almost 36,000 Chariklo clones backwards
in time for one Gyr under the influence of the Sun and the four giant planets.
By recording all close encounters between the clones and planets, we
investigate the likelihood that Chariklo's rings could have survived since its
capture to the Centaur population. Our results reveal that Chariklo's orbit
occupies a region of stable chaos, resulting in its orbit being marginally more
stable than those of the other Centaurs. Despite this, we find that it was most
likely captured to the Centaur population within the last 20 Myr, and that its
orbital evolution has been continually punctuated by regular close encounters
with the giant planets. The great majority (> 99%) of those encounters within
one Hill radius of the planet have only a small effect on the rings. We
conclude that close encounters with giant planets have not had a significant
effect on the ring structure. Encounters within the Roche limit of the giant
planets are rare, making ring creation through tidal disruption unlikely.

C/O$_{\rm disk}$, which does not vary strongly between different planets formed
in our model. The nitrogen content of atmospheres can vary in planets that grow
in different disk models. These differences are related to the formation
history of the planet, the time and location that the planet accretes its
atmosphere, and are encoded in the bulk abundance of NH$_3$. These results
suggest that future observations of atmospheric NH$_3$ and an estimation of the

high-energy astrophysical neutrinos inconsistent with the expectation from
atmospheric backgrounds at a significance greater than $5\sigma$. This flux has
been observed in analyses of both track events from muon neutrino interactions
and cascade events from interactions of all neutrino flavors. Searches for
astrophysical neutrino sources have focused on track events due to the
significantly better angular resolution of track reconstructions. To date, no
such sources have been confirmed. Here we present the first search for
astrophysical neutrino sources using cascades interacting in IceCube with
deposited energies as small as 1 TeV. No significant clustering was observed in
a selection of 263 cascades collected from May 2010 to May 2012. We show that
compared to the classic approach using tracks, this statistically-independent
search offers improved sensitivity to sources in the southern sky, especially
if the emission is spatially extended or follows a soft energy spectrum. This
enhancement is due to the low background from atmospheric neutrinos forming
cascade events and the additional veto of atmospheric neutrinos at declinations
$\lesssim-30^\circ$.

metric Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been an open problem for over
thirty years, with little progress made. It is known that $4/3 \leq \alpha \leq
3/2$, and a famous conjecture states $\alpha = 4/3$. For this problem,
essentially two ""fundamental"" classes of instances have been proposed. This
fundamental property means that in order to show that the integrality gap is at
most $\rho$ for all instances of metric TSP, it is sufficient to show it only
for the instances in the fundamental class. However, despite the importance and
the simplicity of such classes, no apparent effort has been deployed for
improving the integrality gap bounds for them. In this paper we take a natural
first step in this endeavour, and consider the $1/2$-integer points of one such
class. We successfully improve the upper bound for the integrality gap from
$3/2$ to $10/7$ for a superclass of these points, as well as prove a lower

were embedded in philosophical shifts, from the classical Greek ontologies
through increasing pragmatism to formalism and logical positivism. Given that
Goedel demonstrated the limitations of the latter as a foundation for
mathematics, this essay explores phenomenology and Lakatosian ideas, which
together offer a more sound epistemological and ontological basis for
mathematics and a methodology for mathematical development.The question also
then arises of the possible resurrection of earlier, neglected mathematical
projects, including widening the domain of number theory to include integer
qualities revealed in the growth of mathematics in general, which has
predominantly been the growth of quantitative mathematics or logistike, the
complement of arithmetike in classical Greece.

us to do the same with higher quality data and complete coverage of the
Galactic plane. We have made a pilot study comparing dense molecular gas clumps
identified in the Hi-GAL and BGPS surveys, using six $2^\circ \times 2^\circ$
regions centered at Galactic longitudes of $\ell = 11^\circ$, 30$^\circ$,
41$^\circ$, 50$^\circ$, 202$^\circ$, and $217^\circ$. We adopted the BGPS
methodology for identifying clumps and estimating distances, leading to 6198
clumps being identified in our substudy, with 995 of those having
well-constrained distances. These objects were evenly distributed with Galactic
longitude, a consequence of Hi-GAL being source confusion limited. These clumps
range in mass from 10$^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ to 10$^{5}$ M$_\odot$, and have
heliocentric distances of up to 16 kpc. When clumps found in both surveys are
compared, we see that distances agree within 1 kpc and ratios of masses are of
order unity. This serves as an external validation for BGPS and instills
confidence as we move forward to cataloging the clumps from the entirety of
Hi-GAL. In addition to the sources that were in common with BGPS, Hi-GAL found
many additional sources, primarily due to the lack of atmospheric noise. We
expect Hi-GAL to yield $2\times10^5$ clumps, with 20% having well-constrained
distances, an order of magnitude above what was found in BGPS.

  improves by a logarithmic factor the approximation ratio in Section 3",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with two distinguished vertices $s,t\in V$ and an
integer parameter $L>0$, an {\em $L$-bounded cut} is a subset $F$ of edges
(vertices) such that the every path between $s$ and $t$ in $G\setminus F$ has
length more than $L$. The task is to find an $L$-bounded cut of minimum
cardinality.
  Though the problem is very simple to state and has been studied since the
beginning of the 70's, it is not much understood yet. The problem is known to
be $\cal{NP}$-hard to approximate within a small constant factor even for
$L\geq 4$ (for $L\geq 5$ for the vertex cuts). On the other hand, the best
known approximation algorithm for general graphs has approximation ratio only
$\mathcal{O}({n^{2/3}})$ in the edge case, and $\mathcal{O}({\sqrt{n}})$ in the
vertex case, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices.
  We show that for planar graphs, it is possible to solve both the edge- and
the vertex-version of the problem optimally in time $\mathcal{O}(L^{3L}n)$.
That is, the problem is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to $L$ on
planar graphs. Furthermore, we show that the problem remains FPT even for
bounded genus graphs, a super class of planar graphs.
  Our second contribution deals with approximations of the vertex version of
the problem. We describe an algorithm that for a given a graph $G$, its tree
decomposition of treewidth $\tau$ and vertices $s$ and $t$ computes a
$\tau$-approximation of the minimum $L$-bounded $s-t$ vertex cut; if the
decomposition is not given, then the approximation ratio is $\mathcal{O}(\tau
\sqrt{\log \tau})$. For graphs with treewidth bounded by
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1/2-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, but not by a constant,
this is the best approximation in terms of~$n$ that we are aware of.

events. In these situations, organizations often gather forecasts from multiple
experts or models and average those forecasts to produce a single aggregate
forecast. Because the average forecast is known to be underconfident, methods
have been proposed that create an aggregate forecast more extreme than the
average forecast. But is it always appropriate to extremize the average
forecast? And if not, when is it appropriate to anti-extremize (i.e., to make
the aggregate forecast less extreme)? To answer these questions, we introduce a
class of optimal aggregators. These aggregators are Bayesian ensembles because
they follow from a Bayesian model of the underlying information experts have.
Each ensemble is a generalized additive model of experts' probabilities that
first transforms the experts' probabilities into their corresponding
information states, then linearly combines these information states, and
finally transforms the combined information states back into the probability
space. Analytically, we find that these optimal aggregators do not always
extremize the average forecast, and when they do, they can run counter to
existing methods. On two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that these
new ensembles are easily fit to real forecast data and are more accurate than
existing methods.

the state space with a ""lazy"" dynamic programming recursion on a set of samples
to grow a tree of near-optimal paths. GMT*, however, alters the approach of FMT
with approximate dynamic programming by expanding, in parallel, the group of

the minimum cost sample. This group approximation enables low-level parallelism
over the sample set and removes the need for sequential data structures, while
the ""lazy"" collision checking limits thread divergence---all contributing to a
very efficient GPU implementation. While this approach incurs some

heuristic. This framework can accommodate a large range of heuristics, allowing
those that capture the history dependence of localization drift and represent
complex modern perception methods. We present two such heuristics, one derived

length scale between first neighbors and a second characteristic length scale
between third neighbors. We investigate how the temperature and colloidal
density will affect the assembled morphologies. The potential shows aggregate
patterns similar to observed in previous works, as clusters, stripes and porous
phase. Nevertheless, we observe at high densities and temperatures a porous
mesophase with a high mobility, which we name fluid porous phase, while at
lower temperatures the porous structure is rigid. triangular packing was
observed for the colloids and pores in both solid and fluid porous phases. Our
results show that the porous structure is well defined for a large range of
temperature and density, and that the fluid porous phase is a consequence of
the competitive interaction and the random forces from the Langevin Dynamics.

deliver more performance and functionality, while expected to provide verified

utilization of components such as real-time operating systems (RTOS), without
requiring their correctness to guarantee safety, is necessary.
  In this paper, we propose a design approach to deploy safe-by-design embedded
systems. To attain this goal, we rely on a small core of verified software to
handle faults in applications and RTOS and recover from them while ensuring
that timing constraints of safety-critical tasks are always satisfied. Faults
are detected by monitoring the application timing and fault-recovery is
achieved via full platform restart and software reload, enabled by the short
restart time of embedded systems. Schedulability analysis is used to ensure
that the timing constraints of critical plant control tasks are always
satisfied in spite of faults and consequent restarts. We derive schedulability
results for four restart-tolerant task models. We use a simulator to evaluate

  In this work, we propose the first systematic classification of quantum

distinct quantum security classes, or domains, each of them encompassing the
security notions and constructions related to a particular scenario. We start
with the class QS0, which is `classical cryptography' (meaning that no quantum
scenario is considered). Regarding post-quantum cryptography, we introduce the
class QS1, where we discuss in detail the problems arising when designing a
classical cryptographic object meant to be resistant against adversaries with
local quantum computing power, and we provide a classification of the possible
quantum security reductions in this scenario when considering provable
security. In respect to hybrid classical-quantum models, in the security class
QS2 we discuss in detail the possible scenarios where these scenarios arise,
and what a correct formalization should be in terms of quantum oracle access.
Finally, in the class QS3 we consider all those cryptographic constructions
designed to run natively on quantum hardware.

tool for the scientific community in addressing the challenges arising when
formalizing sound constructions and notions of security in the quantum world.

assessing potential effects of vaccine intervention strategies. We examine
rotavirus infection in the Maradi area in southern Niger using hospital
surveillance data provided by Epicentre collected over two years. Additionally,
a cluster survey of households in the region allows us to estimate the
proportion of children with diarrhea who consulted at a health structure. Model
fit and future projections are necessarily particular to a given model; thus,
where there are competing models for the underlying epidemiology an ensemble
approach can account for that uncertainty. We compare our results across
several variants of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental models
to quantify the impact of modeling assumptions on our estimates. Model-specific
parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo.
We then use Bayesian model averaging to generate ensemble estimates of the
current dynamics, including estimates of $R_0$, the burden of infection in the

that a synchronizing, distributed Laplacian feedback can be designed using
relative estimates of the neighbours. Under a strict monotonicity property of

requires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications.
In this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak supervisions, i.e.,
only image-level supervisions. To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags

learning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the
traditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and

Through this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification

terms of the progenitor radius and the mass-loss rate in the final centuries

accumulating that the final mass-loss rate tends to be larger for a more
extended progenitor, with the difference exceeding an order of magnitude
between the more and less extended progenitors. The high mass-loss rates
inferred for the more extended progenitors are not readily explained by a
prescription commonly used for a single stellar wind. In this paper, we
calculate a grid of binary evolution models. We show that the observational
relation in the progenitor radii and mass-loss rates may be a consequence of
non-conservative mass transfer in the final phase of progenitor evolution
without fine tuning. Further, we find a possible link between SNe IIb and SNe
IIn. The binary scenario for SNe IIb inevitably leads to a population of SN
progenitors surrounded by dense circumstellar matter (CSM) due to extensive
mass loss ($\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) in the binary
origin. About 4% of all observed SNe IIn are predicted to have dense CSM,
produced by binary non-conservative mass transfer, whose observed
characteristics are distinguishable from SNe IIn from other scenarios. Indeed,
such SNe may be observationally dominated by systems experiencing huge mass
loss in the final $10^3$ yr, leading to luminous SNe IIn or initially bright

Floquet multipliers of all possible SOPS by solving rigorously an eigenvalue
problem, again using a formulation introduced by Xie. Using these two main
steps, we prove that all SOPS of Wright's equation are asymptotically stable
for $\alpha \in [ 1.9,6.0]$, and the proof follows. This result is a step
toward the proof of the Jones' Conjecture formulated in 1962.

nanoresonators are presented from the underlying concept of their natural
resonances, the so-called quasi-normal modes (QNMs). The latter are the basic
constituents governing the response of resonators. Characterized by complex
frequencies, QNMs are initially loaded by a driving field and then decay
exponentially in time due to power leakage or absorption. Here, the use of
QNM-expansion formalisms to model these basic effects is explored. Such modal
expansions that operate at complex frequencies distinguish from the current
user habits in electromagnetic modeling, which rely on classical Maxwell
equation solvers operating at real frequencies or in the time domain; they also
bring much deeper physical insight into the analysis. An extensive overview of
the historical background on QNMs in electromagnetism and a detailed discussion
of recent relevant theoretical and numerical advances are therefore presented.
Additionally, a concise description of the role of QNMs on a number of examples
involving electromagnetic resonant fields and matter, including the interaction
between quantum emitters and resonators (Purcell effect, weak and strong
coupling, superradiance...), Fano interferences, the perturbation of resonance
modes, and light transport and localization in disordered media is provided.

frequency (RF) chain at the base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) is
employed. Most existing works for mmWave channel estimation exploit sparse
scattering characteristics of the channel. In addition to sparsity, mmWave
channels may exhibit angular spreads over the angle of arrival (AoA), angle of
departure (AoD), and elevation domains. In this paper, we show that angular
spreads give rise to a useful low-rank structure that, along with the sparsity,
can be simultaneously utilized to reduce the sample complexity, i.e. the number
of samples needed to successfully recover the mmWave channel. Specifically, to
effectively leverage the joint sparse and low-rank structure, we develop a
two-stage compressed sensing method for mmWave channel estimation, where the
sparse and low-rank properties are respectively utilized in two consecutive
stages, namely, a matrix completion stage and a sparse recovery stage. Our
theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed two-stage scheme can achieve a
lower sample complexity than a direct compressed sensing method that exploits
only the sparse structure of the mmWave channel. Simulation results are
provided to corroborate our theoretical results and to show the superiority of
the proposed two-stage method.

problem with vast applications in the areas of image search and retrieval. This
problem can be viewed as a label-assignment problem by a classifier dealing
with a very large set of labels, i.e., the vocabulary set. We propose a novel
annotation method that employs two layers of sparse coding and performs
coarse-to-fine labeling. Themes extracted from the training data are treated as
coarse labels. Each theme is a set of training images that share a common
subject in their visual and textual contents. Our system extracts coarse labels
for training and test images without requiring any prior knowledge. Vocabulary
words are the fine labels to be associated with images. Most of the annotation
methods achieve low recall due to the large number of available fine labels,
i.e., vocabulary words. These systems also tend to achieve high precision for
highly frequent words only while relatively rare words are more important for
search and retrieval purposes. Our system not only outperforms various
previously proposed annotation systems, but also achieves symmetric response in
terms of precision and recall. Our system scores and maintains high precision
for words with a wide range of frequencies. Such behavior is achieved by
intelligently reducing the number of available fine labels or words for each

negligible changes were found at other low pressures. These observations
demonstrate that X-ray irradiation can be served as an alternative stimulus for

calculation of the different price sensitivities. The literature contains an
abundant amount of research works that have studied the computation of these
important values. Most of these works consider the well-known Black and Scholes

knowledge, they compute only the first order price sensitivities. Some works
that attempt to extend to markets affected by financial crisis appeared
recently. However, none of these papers deal with the calculation of the price
sensitivities of second order. Providing second derivatives for the underlying
price sensitivities is an important issue in financial risk management because
the investor can determine whether or not each source of risk is increasing at
an increasing rate. In this paper, we work on the computation of second order
prices sensitivities for a market under crisis. The underlying second order
price sensitivities are derived explicitly. The obtained formulas are expected
to improve on the accuracy of the hedging strategies during a financial crunch.

for data stream mining because it is capable of coping with two prominent
issues: online learning and rapidly changing environments. We note at least
three uncharted territories of existing EISs: data uncertainty, temporal system
dynamic, redundant data streams. This book chapter aims at delivering a
concrete solution of this problem with the algorithmic development of a novel
learning algorithm, namely PANFIS++. PANFIS++ is a generalized version of the
PANFIS by putting forward three important components: 1) An online active
learning scenario is developed to overcome redundant data streams. This module
allows to actively select data streams for the training process, thereby
expediting execution time and enhancing generalization performance, 2) PANFIS++
is built upon an interval type-2 fuzzy system environment, which incorporates
the so-called footprint of uncertainty. This component provides a degree of
tolerance for data uncertainty. 3) PANFIS++ is structured under a recurrent
network architecture with a self-feedback loop. This is meant to tackle the
temporal system dynamic. The efficacy of the PANFIS++ has been numerically
validated through numerous real-world and synthetic case studies, where it
delivers the highest predictive accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity.

condition monitoring (TCM) as it is impractical to have human workers monitor
the state of the tools continuously. Tool condition is crucial to ensure the
good quality of products: Worn tools affect not only the surface quality but
also the dimensional accuracy, which means higher reject rate of the products.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify tool failures before it occurs
on the fly. While various versions of intelligent tool condition monitoring
have been proposed, most of them suffer from a cognitive nature of traditional
machine learning algorithms. They focus on the how to learn process without
paying attention to other two crucial issues: what to learn, and when to learn.
The what to learn and the when to learn provide self regulating mechanisms to
select the training samples and to determine time instants to train a model. A
novel tool condition monitoring approach based on a psychologically plausible
concept, namely the metacognitive scaffolding theory, is proposed and built
upon a recently published algorithm, recurrent classifier (rClass). The
learning process consists of three phases: what to learn, how to learn, when to
learn and makes use of a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive
component. Experimental studies with real-world manufacturing data streams were
conducted where rClass demonstrated the highest accuracy while retaining the

methods which have an analog in equilibrium systems, in the remaining two

formula which establishes a correspondence between the GCN and the UCNA

the discussion to the case of an assembly of elastic dumbbells confined to a
parabolic well. By employing the UCNA we find that, for this model, the
pressure determined by the thermodynamic method coincides with the pressures

distribution of the emitted photons. A similar effect must take place in a
crystal for the coherent radiation of relativistic electron. The results of the
theoretical investigation of angular distributions and polarization of
radiation by a relativistic electron passing through a thin (in comparison with
a coherence length) crystal at a small angle to the crystal axis are presented.
The electron trajectories in crystal were simulated using the binary collision
model which takes into account both coherent and incoherent effects at
scattering. The angular distribution of radiation and polarization were
calculated as a sum of radiation from each electron. It is shown that there are
nontrivial angular distributions of the emitted photons and their polarization
that are connected to the superposition of the coherent scattering of electrons
by atomic rows (""doughnut scattering"" effect) and the suppression of radiation
(similar to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in an amorphous matter). It is
also shown that circular polarization of radiation in the considered case is

varieties of multilinear algebras, or, equivalently, the sequences of the
component dimensions of algebraic operads. The (exponentional) generating
functions of such sequences are called codimension series of varieties, or
generating series of operads.
  We show that in general there does not exist an algorithm to decide whether
the growth exponent of a codimension sequence of a variety defined by given
finite sets of operations and identities is equal to a given rational number.
In particular, we solve negatively a recent conjecture by Bremner and Dotsenko
by showing that the set generating series of binary quadratic operads with
bounded number of generators is infinite. Then we recall algorithms which in
many cases calculate the codimension series in the form of a defining algebraic
or differential equation. For a more general class of varieties, these
algorithms give upper and lower bounds for the codimensions in terms of
generating functions and asymptotical bounds for the growth of codimensions.
The upper bound (based on an operadic version of the Golod--Shafarevich
theorem) is just a formal power series satisfying an algebraic equation defined
effectively by the generators and the identities of the variety. The first
stage of an algorithm for the lower bound is the construction of a Groebner
basis of the operad. If the Groebner basis happens to be finite and satisfies
mild restrictions, a recent theorem by the author and Anton Khoroshkin
guarantees that the desired generating function is either algebraic or
differential algebraic. We describe algorithms producing such equations. In the
case of infinite Groebner basis, these algorithms applied to its finite subsets
give lower bounds for the generating function of the codimension sequence.

fluctuation and its time derivative, theoretical framework for Gaussian and
non-Gaussian regimes are revisited. We count number of crossings not only at
{\it zero} level but also for all available thresholds to determine the average
speed of moving particles. Using probabilistic framework in determining
crossing statistics, {\it a priori} Gaussianity is not essentially considered,
therefore even in presence of deviation from Gaussian fluctuation, this
modified approach is capable to compute relevant quantities such as mean value
of speed more precisely. Generalized total crossing which represents the
weighted summation of crossings for all thresholds to quantify small deviation
from Gaussian statistics is introduced. This criterion can also manipulate the
contribution of noises and trends to infer reliable physical quantities. The
characteristic time scale for having successive crossings at a given threshold
is defined. In our experimental setup, we find that increasing sample
temperature leads to more consistency between Gaussian and perturbative
non-Gaussian predictions. The maximum number of crossing does not necessarily
occur at mean level indicating that we should take into account other levels in
addition to {\it zero} level to achieve more accurate assessments.

thermodynamic quantity of physical systems (Clausius, Boltzmann, Gibbs),
entropy as a measure for information production of ergodic sources (Shannon),
and entropy as a means for statistical inference on multinomial Bernoulli
processes (Jaynes maximum entropy principle). Even though these notions are
fundamentally different concepts, the functional form of the entropy for
thermodynamic systems in equilibrium, for ergodic sources in information
theory, and for independent sampling processes in statistical systems, is
degenerate, $H(p)=-\sum_i p_i\log p_i$. For many complex systems, which are
typically history-dependent, non-ergodic and non-multinomial, this is no longer
the case. Here we show that for such processes the three entropy concepts lead
to different functional forms of entropy. We explicitly compute these entropy
functionals for three concrete examples. For Polya urn processes, which are
simple self-reinforcing processes, the source information rate is $S_{\rm
IT}=\frac{1}{1-c}\frac1N \log N$, the thermodynamical (extensive) entropy is
$(c,d)$-entropy, $S_{\rm EXT}=S_{(c,0)}$, and the entropy in the maxent
principle (MEP) is $S_{\rm MEP}(p)=-\sum_i \log p_i$. For sample space reducing
(SSR) processes, which are simple path-dependent processes that are associated
with power law statistics, the information rate is $S_{\rm IT}=1+ \frac12 \log
W$, the extensive entropy is $S_{\rm EXT}=H(p)$, and the maxent result is
$S_{\rm MEP}(p)=H(p/p_1)+H(1-p/p_1)$. Finally, for multinomial mixture
processes, the information rate is given by the conditional entropy $\langle
H\rangle_f$, with respect to the mixing kernel $f$, the extensive entropy is
given by $H$, and the MEP functional corresponds one-to-one to the logarithm of
the mixing kernel.
