possibility of purely algebraic deduction of the Vaidya solution without
integrating the field equations, and interpret this possibility as an artifact
of curvature coordinates. Since Vaidya's approach by itself cannot lead to
certain dependence of mass on spacetime coordinates, the search for a

  The twisted form of supergravity that is used here can be quantized to all

all orders in perturbation theory, in both the gravitational theory and the

For example, if $g_{ab}$ is the $k=0$ Lorentzian de Sitter metric corresponding

we model the joint evolution of user experience, interest in specific item
facets, writing style, and rating behavior. This way we can generate individual
recommendations that take into account the user's maturity level (e.g.,
recommending art movies rather than blockbusters for a cinematography expert).
As only item ratings and review texts are observables, we capture the user's
experience and interests in a latent model learned from her reviews, vocabulary
and writing style. We develop a generative HMM-LDA model to trace user
evolution, where the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) traces her latent experience
progressing over time -- with solely user reviews and ratings as observables
over time. The facets of a user's interest are drawn from a Latent Dirichlet

transmit more than once to counter channel uncertainty. For slotted ALOHA-like
access, each node attempts transmission in every slot with a certain

microwave background (CMB) polarization rotation derived from 150 GHz data
taken by the BICEP2/Keck Array CMB experiments up to and including the 2014
observing season (BK14). The definition of the polarization angle in BK14 maps
has gone through self-calibration in which the overall angle is adjusted to
minimize the observed TB and EB power spectra. After this procedure, the QU
maps lose sensitivity to a uniform polarization rotation but are still
sensitive to anisotropies of polarization rotation. This analysis places
constraints on the anisotropies of polarization rotation, which could be
generated by CMB photons interacting with axionlike pseudoscalar fields or
Faraday rotation induced by primordial magnetic fields. The sensitivity of BK14
maps ($\sim 3\mu$K-arcmin) makes it possible to reconstruct anisotropies of the
polarization rotation angle and measure their angular power spectrum much more
precisely than previous attempts. Our data are found to be consistent with no
polarization rotation anisotropies, improving the upper bound on the amplitude
of the rotation angle spectrum by roughly an order of magnitude compared to the
previous best constraints. Our results lead to an order of magnitude better
constraint on the coupling constant of the Chern-Simons electromagnetic term
$g_{a\gamma}\leq 7.2\times 10^{-2}/H_I$ (95% confidence) than the constraint
derived from the B-mode spectrum, where $H_I$ is the inflationary Hubble scale.
This constraint leads to a limit on the decay constant of $10^{-6}\lesssim
f_a/M_{\rm pl}$ at mass range of $10^{-33}< m_a< 10^{-28}$ eV for $r=0.01$,
assuming $g_{a\gamma}\sim\alpha/(2\pi f_a)$ with $\alpha$ denoting the fine
structure constant. The upper bound on the amplitude of the primordial magnetic

chosen low-phonon-energy glass fibers. In particular, we calculate anticipated
threshold pump powers for optimal laser designs and pump wavelengths for single
frequency (fundamental mode) operation of specific mid-infrared DFB-RFLs
operating at chosen target wavelengths, and show that these pump powers can be
as low as a few milliWatts for MIR DFB-RFLs fabricated with appropriate
low-loss small mode area single mode fibers. As such, we clearly establish the
PPS-DFB RFL platform as a very practical approach for constructing a broad
range of narrow linewidth MIR coherent sources for numerous applications,
including proximal and remote sensing of molecules and various high spectral
brightness and long coherence length MIR applications.

Dynamic meshing was used for evolving the flow domain in time as the melting

used to retain mesh quality across the significant mesh deformation. We
simulated one case above the density inversion point of water and one case
below, yielding pear-shaped melting fronts due to thermal plumes either rising

melting rates were in agreement. We confirm that natural convection plays a

incorporates multi-level saliency predictions within a single network, which
significantly decreases the redundancy of previous approaches of learning
multiple network streams with different input scales. Extensive experimental

advantages of near-infrared surveys, when compared to optical counterparts, is
that the interstellar extinction is significantly smaller. As we see in this
review, a significant volume of the Galactic disk can be reached by infrared
surveys but not by optical ones. Towards highly obscured regions in the
Galactic mid-plane, however, the interstellar extinction causes serious
problems even with near-infrared data in understanding the observational
results. After a review on previous and current near-infrared surveys, we
discuss the effects of the interstellar extinction in optical (including {\it
Gaia}) to near-infrared broad bands based on a simple calculation using
synthetic spectral energy distribution. We then review the recent results on
classical Cepheids towards the Galactic center and the bulge, as a case study,
to see the impact of the uncertainty in the extinction law. The extinction law,
i.e. the wavelength dependency of the extinction, is not fully characterized,
and its uncertainty makes it hard to make the correction. Its characterization
is an urgent task in order to exploit the outcomes of ongoing large-scale
surveys of pulsating stars, e.g. for drawing a map of pulsating stars across
the Galactic disk.

which the planned mobilities of the nodes are partially known a priori and the
nodes travel in groups. This situation arises commonly in military and
emergency response scenarios. Optimal routes are computed using the most
reliable path principle in which the negative logarithm of a node pair's
adjacency probability is used as a link weight metric. This probability is
estimated using the mobility plan as well as dynamic information captured by
table exchanges, including a measure of the social tie strength between nodes.
The latter information is useful when nodes deviate from their plans or when
the plans are inaccurate. We compare the proposed routing algorithm with the
commonly-used optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol in ns-3 simulations.
As the OLSR protocol does not exploit the mobility plans, it relies on link
state determination which suffers with increasing mobility. Our simulations
show considerably better throughput performance with the proposed approach as
compared with OLSR at the expense of increased overhead. However, in the
high-throughput regime, the proposed approach outperforms OLSR in terms of both

velocity gradient fluctuations, a high Reynolds number flow is a fascinating
mixture of purely random, close to Gaussian, fields and coherent structures
where substantial fraction of kinetic energy is dissipated into heat. To
evaluate intensity of fluctuations, one usually studies different moments of
velocity increments and/or dissipation rate, characterized by scaling exponents
$\zeta_{n}$ and $d_{n}$, respectively. In high Reynolds number flows, the
moments of different orders with $n\neq m$ cannot be simply related to each
other, which is the signature of anomalous scaling, making this problem ""the
last unsolvable"". No perturbative treatment can lead to quantitative
description of this feature. In this work the expressions for the moments of
dissipation rate $e_{n}=\overline{{\cal E}^{n}}\propto Re^{d_{n}}$ and those of
velocity derivatives $M_{2n}=\overline{(\partial_{x}u_{x})^{2n}}\propto
\frac{v_{o}^{2n}}{L^{2n}}Re^{\rho_{2n}}$ are derived for an infinite fluid
stirred by a white-in-time Gaussian random force supported in the vicinity of
the wave number $k_{f}\approx \frac{2\pi}{L}=O(1)$, where $v_{0}$ and $L$ are
characteristic velocity and integral scale, respectively. A novel aspect of
this work is that unlike previous efforts which aimed at seeking solutions
around the infinite Reynolds number limit, we concentrate on the vicinity of
transitional Reynolds numbers $Re^{tr}$ of the first emergence of anomalous
scaling out of Low-Re Gaussian background. The obtained closed expressions for
anomalous scaling exponents $d_{n}$ and $\rho_{n}$ agree well with available in
literature experimental and numerical data and, when $n\gg 1$, $d_{n}\approx
0.3n \ln(n)$.

oleoplaning, akin to tires hydroplaning on a wet road, with minimal dissipative

quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) started to develop gradually from 9 hours before
the first M-class flare. One of the flare ribbons that appeared in the first
M-class flare was co-spatial with the location of the QSLs, suggesting that the
formation of the QSLs is important in the process of energy release. These QSLs
do not appear in the potential field calculation, indicating that they were
created by the non-potential field. The formation of the QSLs was associated
with the transverse photospheric motion of the pre-emerged flux and the
emergence of a new flux. This observation indicates that the occurrence of the
flares requires the formation of QSLs in the non-potential field in which free

models has shown to improve their accuracy in several problem settings.
However, the search space of relational features is exponential in the number
of basic input features. Consequently, approaches that learn relational
features, tend to follow a greedy search strategy. In this paper, we study the
possibility of optimally learning and applying discriminative relational
features for sequence labeling. For learning features derived from inputs at a
particular sequence position, we propose a Hierarchical Kernels-based approach
(referred to as Hierarchical Kernel Learning for Structured Output Spaces -
StructHKL). This approach optimally and efficiently explores the hierarchical
structure of the feature space for problems with structured output spaces such
as sequence labeling. Since the StructHKL approach has limitations in learning
complex relational features derived from inputs at relative positions, we
propose two solutions to learn relational features namely, (i) enumerating
simple component features of complex relational features and discovering their
compositions using StructHKL and (ii) leveraging relational kernels, that
compute the similarity between instances implicitly, in the sequence labeling
problem. We perform extensive empirical evaluation on publicly available
datasets and record our observations on settings in which certain approaches
are effective.

controlling infection within a host? And how can we distinguish between
resource depletion and other mechanisms that may contribute to decline of
pathogen load or lead to pathogen clearance? In this paper we examine data from
a previously published experiment. In this experiment, mice were infected with
influenza virus carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter gene, and the
proportion of lung epithelial cells that were influenza infected was measured
as a function of time. Three inoculum dose groups - 10^4 PFU, 10^6 PFU and 10^7
PFU - were used. The proportion of cells infected was estimated to be about 21
(95% confidence interval: 14-32) fold higher in the highest dose group than in
the lowest dose group with the middle dose group in between. We show that this
pattern is highly inconsistent with a model where target cell depletion is the
principal means of controlling infection, and we argue that such a pattern
constitutes a reasonable criterion for rejecting many resource depletion
models. A model with an innate interferon response that renders susceptible
cells resistant fits the data reasonably well. This model suggests that target
cell depletion is only a minor factor in controlling natural influenza
infection.

non-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic field that best correlates with the
observed vector magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs). To focus on these
ideas, simulations are performed for the flaring AR 11283 noted for its
complexity and well-documented dynamics. The simulated dynamics develops as the
initial Lorentz force pushes the plasma and facilitates successive magnetic
reconnections at the two X-type null lines present in the initial field.
Importantly, the simulation allows for the spontaneous development of mass
flow, unique among contemporary works, that preferentially reconnects field
lines at one of the X-type null lines. Consequently, a flux rope consisting of
low-lying twisted MFLs, which approximately traces the major polarity inversion
line, undergoes an asymmetric monotonic rise. The rise is attributed to a
reduction in the magnetic tension force at the region overlying the rope,
resulting from the reconnection. A monotonic rise of the rope is in conformity
with the standard scenario of flares. Importantly, the simulated dynamics leads
to bifurcations of the flux rope, which, being akin to the observed filament
bifurcation in AR 11283, establishes the appropriateness of the initial field

that pool (peer) exclusion can always outperform pool (peer) punishment both in

better than pool exclusion both in the optional and in the compulsory game, but
the situation is reversed in the presence of second-order exclusion. Finally,
we extend the competition among all possible sanctioning strategies and find
that peer exclusion can outperform all other strategies in the absence of

second-order sanctioning is possible. Our results demonstrate that exclusion is
a more powerful strategy than punishment for the resolution of social dilemmas.

relativistic jet from active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to
$\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^+e^-$ conversion is considered analytically. We
argue that the effects of charge average separation due to specific initial
pairs' motion lead to partial magnetic and electric fields screening or
enhancement. The effect of the fields screening has not been considered
earlier. The pairs with the center-of-mass moving faster or slower than the
bulk plasma flow create a surface charge and a current which either screen or
enhance both electric and magnetic fields in a pair creation domain. This
impacts the bulk flow motion, which either accelerates or decelerates. The
pairs with the center-of-mass moving with exactly the drift velocity does not
induce the fields disturbance. In this case the flow decelerates due to pure
mass-loading. For these different cases the Lorentz factor of the loaded
outflow is calculated as a function of loading pairs number density. The effect
may be important on sub-parsec to parsec scales due to conversion of TeV jet
radiation on soft infra-red to ultra-violet external isotropic photon field.
This leads to an outer shell acceleration. The conversion of MeV jet radiation
on larger scales may account for the flow deceleration due to pure
mass-loading. The proposed mechanism may be a source of internal shocks and
instabilities in the pair creation region.

supports convolution as well. We also develop a three-step design optimization

spectral peak along the molecular dispersion appears in the spectral weight.We
also clarify how this coupling phenomenon is seen in the Bose channel. Since a
hetero-nuclear Feshbach resonance, as well as the formation of Bose-Fermi
molecules, have been realized, our results would be useful for the study of
strong-coupling properties of this unique quantum gas.

is generalized here for systems with coupled channels, such as in nuclear
physics. The relevant asymptotic form is presented and contact matrices are
defined. Generally, for the case of two coupled channels, two two-body
functions are included in the asymptotic form, resulting a 2 x 2 contact
matrix. Nevertheless, it is shown that if the coupling terms of the potential
are very weak or very strong, only a single two-body function is needed,
resulting a single contact. This universal result is directly relevant to
nuclear systems, and provides a theoretical explanation for the fact that
proton-neutron short-range correlations can be described using the single
bound-state deuteron wave function. It is achieved by applying an appropriate
boundary condition on the two-body functions. This boundary condition can be
interpreted as a mean field potential imposed on the correlated pair due to the

  (55 pp). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1610.00872",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $Z$ be a subordinate Brownian motion in ${\mathbb R}^d$, $d\ge 2$, via a
subordinator with Laplace exponent $\phi$. We kill the process $Z$ upon exiting
a bounded open set $D\subset {\mathbb R}^d$ to obtain the killed process $Z^D$,
and then we subordinate the process $Z^D$ by a subordinator with Laplace
exponent $\psi$. The resulting process is denoted by $Y^D$. Both $\phi$ and
$\psi$ are assumed to satisfy certain weak scaling conditions at infinity.
  We study the potential theory of $Y^D$, in particular the boundary theory.
First, in case that $D$ is a $\kappa$-fat bounded open set, we show that the
Harnack inequality holds. If, in addition, $D$ satisfies the local exterior
volume condition, then we prove the Carleson estimate. In case $D$ is a smooth
open set and the lower weak scaling index of $\psi$ is strictly larger than
$1/2$, we establish the boundary Harnack principle with explicit decay rate
near the boundary of $D$. On the other hand, when
$\psi(\lambda)=\lambda^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma\in (0,1/2]$, we show that the
boundary Harnack principle near the boundary of $D$ fails for any bounded
$C^{1,1}$ open set $D$. Our results give the first example where the Carleson
estimate holds true, but the boundary Harnack principle does not.
  One of the main ingredients in the proofs is the sharp two-sided estimates of
the Green function of $Y^D$. Under an additional condition on $\psi$, we
establish sharp two-sided estimates of the jumping kernel of $Y^D$ which
exhibit some unexpected boundary behavior.
  We also prove a boundary Harnack principle for non-negative functions
harmonic in a smooth open set $E$ strictly contained in $D$, showing that the
behavior of $Y^D$ in the interior of $D$ is determined by the composition
$\psi\circ \phi$.

practice, however, there are challenges associated with considerations of
scanning costs, patient comfort, and scanning time that constrain how much data
can be acquired in clinical or research studies. In this paper, we explore the
possibility of generating high-resolution and multimodal images from
low-resolution single-modality imagery. We propose the weakly-supervised joint
convolutional sparse coding to simultaneously solve the problems of
super-resolution (SR) and cross-modality image synthesis. The learning process
requires only a few registered multimodal image pairs as the training set.
Additionally, the quality of the joint dictionary learning can be improved
using a larger set of unpaired images. To combine unpaired data from different
image resolutions/modalities, a hetero-domain image alignment term is proposed.
Local image neighborhoods are naturally preserved by operating on the whole
image domain (as opposed to image patches) and using joint convolutional sparse
coding. The paired images are enhanced in the joint learning process with
unpaired data and an additional maximum mean discrepancy term, which minimizes
the dissimilarity between their feature distributions. Experiments show that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both SR
reconstruction and simultaneous SR and cross-modality synthesis.

threshold time, interpreted within the Collapsar model as the time it takes for
the relativistic jet to penetrate the stellar envelope. Numerical simulation
and macronova observations suggest that compact binary mergers involve mass
ejection. If short-Gamma Ray Bursts (sGRBs) arise from such mergers, their jets
should cross this surrounding ejecta before producing the prompt emission. Like
in LGRBs, this should result in a distinct short plateau in the GRBs' duration
distribution. We present a new analysis of the duration distribution for the
three GRB satellites: BATSE, {\it Swift} and Fermi. We find a clear evidence
for a short ($\sim 0.4$ sec) plateau in the duration distribution. This plateau
is consistent with the expected jet crossing time, provided that the ejecta is

Considering two-dimensional angular momentum space, we focus on ""empty loss
cone"" systems, where the typical scattering during a dynamical time $j_{d}$ is
smaller than the size of the loss cone $j_{\rm lc}$. As a result, the
occupation number within the loss cone is significantly smaller than outside.
Classical diffusive treatment of this regime predict exponentially small
occupation number deep in the loss cone. We revisit this classical derivation
of occupancy distribution of objects in the empty loss cone regime. We
emphasize the role of the rare large scatterings and show that the occupancy
does not decay exponentially within the loss cone, but it is rather flat, with
a typical value $\sim [(j_d/j_{\rm lc})]^2\ln^{-2}(j_{\rm lc}/j_{\min})$
compared to the occupation in circular angular momentum (where $j_{\min}$ is
the smallest possible scattering). Implication are that although the loss cone
for tidal break of Giants or binaries is typically empty, tidal events which
occurs significantly inside the loss cone ($\beta\gtrsim 2$), are almost as
common as those with $\beta\cong 1$ where $\beta$ is the ratio between the
tidal radius and the periastron. The probability for event with penetration
factor $>\beta$ decreases only as $\beta^{-1}$ rather than exponentially. This
effect has no influence on events characterized by full loss cone, such as
tidal disruption event of $\sim 1m_\odot$ main sequence star.

necessary extensions consist in a representation of the management loop and the
potential frictions influencing the loop. The effects of the non-deterministic
frictions can be taken into account by including the measures of robustness and
risk in the assessment of management options. Thus, besides of the increased
structural complexity resulting from the model extensions, the computational

"1705.02613","Shahbaz Khan","Surender Baswana, Ayush Goel, Shahbaz Khan","Incremental DFS algorithms: a theoretical and experimental study","31 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Depth First Search (DFS) tree is a fundamental data structure for solving
graph problems. The DFS tree of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can
be built in $O(m+n)$ time. Till date, only a few algorithms have been designed
for maintaining incremental DFS. For undirected graphs, the two algorithms,
namely, ADFS1 and ADFS2 [ICALP14] achieve total $O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{m})$ and
$O(n^2)$ time respectively. For DAGs, the only non-trivial algorithm, namely,
FDFS [IPL97] requires total $O(mn)$ time.
  In this paper, we carry out extensive experimental and theoretical evaluation
of existing incremental DFS algorithms in random and real graphs, and derive
the following results.
  1- For insertion of uniformly random sequence of $n \choose 2$ edges, ADFS1,
ADFS2 and FDFS perform equally well and are found to take $\Theta(n^2)$ time
experimentally. This is quite surprising because the worst case bounds of ADFS1
and FDFS are greater than $\Theta(n^2)$ by a factor of $\sqrt{m/n}$ and $m/n$
respectively. We complement this result by probabilistic analysis of these
algorithms proving $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bound on the update time. Here, we derive
results about the structure of a DFS tree in random graphs, which are of
independent interest.
  2- These insights led us to design an extremely simple incremental DFS
algorithm for both undirected and directed graphs. This algorithm theoretically
matches and experimentally outperforms the state-of-the-art in dense random
graphs. It can also be used as a single-pass semi-streaming algorithm for
incremental DFS and strong connectivity in random graphs.
  3- Even for real graphs, both ADFS1 and FDFS perform much better than their
theoretical bounds. Here again, we present two simple algorithms for
incremental DFS for directed and undirected real graphs. In fact, our algorithm
for directed graphs almost always matches the performance of FDFS.

the boundary-layer flow over an infinite compliant flat wall is considered.
Using a wall-normal velocity/wall-normal vorticity formalism, the dynamic
boundary condition at the compliant wall admits a linear dependence on the
eigenvalue parameter, as compared to a quadratic one in the canonical
formulation of the problem. This greatly simplifies the accurate calculation of
the continuous spectrum by means of a spectral method, thereby yielding a very
effective filtering of the pseudospectra as well as a clear identification of
instability regions. The regime of global instability is found to be matching
the regime of the favorable phase of the forcing by the flow on the compliant
wall so as to enhance the amplitude of the wall. An energy-budget analysis for
the least-decaying hydroelastic (static-divergence, traveling-wave-flutter and
near-stationary transitional) and Tollmien--Schlichting modes in the parameter
space reveals the primary routes of energy flow. Moreover, the flow exhibits a
slower transient growth for the maximum growth rate of a superposition of
streamwise-independent modes due to a complex dependence of the wall-boundary
condition with the Reynolds number. The initial and optimal perturbations are
compared with the boundary-layer flow over a solid wall; differences and
similarities are discussed. Unlike the solid-wall case, viscosity plays a
pivotal role in the transient growth. A slowdown of the maximum growth rate
with the Reynolds number is uncovered and found to originate in the transition
of the fluid-solid interaction from a two-way to a one-way coupling. Finally, a
term-by-term energy budget analysis is performed to identify the key
contributors to the transient growth mechanism.

interaction between individual solitons. This interaction is mediated through
the tails of each soliton that overlap with one another. When such soliton
tails have spatial oscillations, locking or pinning between two solitons can
occur at fixed distances related with the wavelength of these oscillations,
thus forming a bound state. In this work, we study the formation and stability
of various types of bound states in the Lugiato-Lefever equation by computing
their interaction potential and by analyzing the properties of the oscillatory
tails. Moreover, we study the effect of higher order dispersion and noise in
the pump intensity on the dynamics of bound states. In doing so, we reveal that
perturbations to the Lugiato-Lefever equation that maintain reversibility, such
as fourth order dispersion, lead to bound states that tend to separate from one
another in time when noise is added. This separation force is determined by the
shape of the envelope of the interaction potential, as well as an additional
Brownian ratchet effect. In systems with broken reversibility, such as third
order dispersion, this ratchet effect continues to push solitons within a bound
state apart. However, the force generated by the envelope of the potential is
now such that it pushes the solitons towards each other, leading to a null net
drift of the solitons.

healthy or diseased, to cells, organs or individuals. State assignment or
making a diagnosis is often a nontrivial and challenging process and, with the
advent of omics technologies, the diagnostic challenge is becoming more and
more serious. The challenge lies not only in the increasing number of measured
properties and dynamics of the system (e.g. cell or human body) but also in the
co-evolution of multiple states and overlapping properties, and degeneracy of
states. We develop, from first principles, a generic rational framework for
state assignment in cell biology and medicine, and demonstrate its
applicability with a few simple theoretical case studies from medical
diagnostics. We show how disease-related statistical information can be used to
build a comprehensive model that includes the relevant dependencies between
clinical and laboratory findings (signs) and diseases. In particular, we
include disease-disease and sign-sign interactions. We then study how one can
infer the probability of a disease in a patient with given signs. We perform
comparative analysis with simple benchmark models to check the performances of
our models. This first principles approach, as we show, enables the
construction of consensus diagnostic flow charts and facilitates the early
diagnosis of disease. Additionally, we envision that our approach will find
applications in systems biology, and in particular, in characterizing the

shearing resistance induces a low-frequency peak in the particle self-mobility,
resulting from the membrane normal displacement in the same way, although less
pronounced, to what has been observed for the axisymmetric motion. In the zero
frequency limit, the self-mobility correction near a hard sphere is recovered
only if the membrane has a non-vanishing resistance towards shearing. We
further compute the particle in-plane mean-square displacement of a nearby
diffusing particle, finding that the membrane induces a long-lasting

to give a preview of the redshift accuracy one can reach with this method. To
do so, we first highlight the requirements of this technique in term of number
of objects in both the reference and unknown samples. We also confirm that this
method does not require a representative spectroscopic sample for calibration.
  We estimate that a density of spectroscopic objects of $10^{-5}$
arcmin$^{-2}$ per redshift bin of width $\delta z = 0.01$ over $9000 \
\text{deg}^{2}$ allows to reach 0.1 \% accuracy in the mean redshift for a
galaxy density compatible with next generation of cosmological surveys. This
number is compatible with the density of the Quasi Stellar Objects in BOSS.
Second we demonstrate our ability to measure individual redshifts for galaxies
independently from the photometric redshifts procedure. The resulting
individual clustering redshifts have a bias=$-0.001$, an outlier fraction of
$\eta=3.57\%$ and a scatter of $\sigma=0.027$ to $i<25$. The advantage of this
procedure is threefold: i) it allows the use of clustering redshifts for any
field in astronomy, ii) it allows the possibility to combine photometric and
clustering based redshifts to get an improved redshift estimation, iii) it
allows the use of cluster-$z$ to define tomographic bins for weak lensing.
Finally we explore this last option and build 5 clustering redshift selected

industrial applications. Among its many useful properties is its high thermal
conductivity, which makes it advantageous for thermal management applications.
In this paper we present \textit{ab initio} calculations of the in-plane and
cross-plane thermal conductivities, $\kappa_{\text{in}}$ and
$\kappa_{\text{out}}$, of three common hexagonal polytypes of SiC: 2H, 4H and
6H. The phonon Boltzmann transport equation is solved iteratively using as
input interatomic force constants determined from density functional theory.
Both $\kappa_{\text{in}}$ and $\kappa_{\text{out}}$ decrease with increasing
$n$ in $n$H SiC because of additional low-lying optic phonon branches. These
optic branches are characterized by low phonon group velocities, and they
increase the phase space for phonon-phonon scattering of acoustic modes. Also,
for all $n$, $\kappa_{\text{in}}$ is found to be larger than
$\kappa_{\text{out}}$ in the temperature range considered. At electron
concentrations present in experimental samples, scattering of phonons by
electrons is shown to be negligible except well below room temperature where it
can lead to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity. This
work highlights the power of \textit{ab initio} approaches in giving
quantitative, predictive descriptions of thermal transport in materials. It
helps explain the qualitative disagreement that exists among different sets of
measured thermal conductivity data and provides information of the relative
quality of samples from which measured data was obtained.

collisions at the LHC is studied within the context of the SM with UED. The
impact of an arbitrary number $n$ of UED on both the $gg\to H$ and $H\to \gamma
\gamma$ subprocesses is studied. The 1-loop contributions of Kaluza-Klein
excitations to these subprocesses are proportional to discrete and continuous
sums, which can diverge. By implementing dimensional regularization, it is
shown that discrete regularized sums can naturally be expressed as
multidimensional Epstein functions, and that divergences, if exist, emerge
through the poles of these functions. It is found that continuous sums
converge, but the discrete ones diverge, with the exception of the $n=1$ case,
in which the 1-dimensional Epstein function converges. It is argued that
divergences that arise from discrete sums for $n\geq 2$ are genuine UV
divergences, since they correspond to short-distance effects in the compact
manifold. Then, the amplitudes are renormalized in a modern sense by
incorporating interactions of canonical dimension higher than four that allow
us to generate the required counterterms, which are determined using a
$\overline{\rm MS}$-like renormalization scheme. We find that the $gg\to H$
subprocess is quite sensitive to both the size and the dimension of the compact
manifold, but the SM prediction for $H\to \gamma \gamma$ subprocess is
practically unchanged. In the $n=1$ case, it is found that the experimental
constraint on the compactification scale $R^{-1}\geq 1.5$ TeV allow us to
reproduce the experimental limit on the signal strength $1.01\leq
\mu^{(1)}_{\gamma \gamma}\leq 1.2$. In the $n\geq 2$ cases, it is found that

neural networks, associative memories, and distributed systems, we present in
this work a new class of codes, called codes over graphs. Under this paradigm,
the information is stored on the edges of an undirected graph, and a code over
graphs is a set of graphs. A node failure is the event where all edges in the
neighborhood of the failed node have been erased. We say that a code over
graphs can tolerate $\rho$ node failures if it can correct the erased edges of
any $\rho$ failed nodes in the graph. While the construction of such codes can
be easily accomplished by MDS codes, their field size has to be at least
$O(n^2)$, when $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. In this work we present
several constructions of codes over graphs with smaller field size. In
particular, we present optimal codes over graphs correcting two node failures
over the binary field, when the number of nodes in the graph is a prime number.
We also present a construction of codes over graphs correcting $\rho$ node
failures for all $\rho$ over a field of size at least $(n+1)/2-1$, and show how
to improve this construction for optimal codes when $\rho=2,3$.

that unifies all four types of fundamental interactions is represented. Among
the most exciting predictions of physics beyond the Standard Model is the
assumption of the space of extra dimensions that solves the hierarchy problem.
With the presence of this extra dimensions are connected the searches for
Kaluza-Klein partners of gravitons, gauge bosons and microscopic black holes at
the LHC. In the framework of F-theory, Calabi-Yau fourfold is considered as a
space of extra dimensions. We study the duality between the F-theory
compactified on the K3-surface and $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string
compactified on the torus, $T^2$. The set of BPS states corresponding to the
Calabi-Yau fourfolds, which has either an elliptic curve or a K3-fibration as a
layer, is studied in the aspect of correspondence to the KK modes of the
M-theory on $R^8\times T^2 \times S^1 / Z_2$. The singularities of the moduli
space of the Calabi-Yau fourfold make it possible to observe massive KK modes,
the masses of which are obtained from the M-theory of supergravity. The result
is of interest for a theoretical understanding of the KK modes, the
experimental searches for which are carried out at the LHC.

In
this paper we illustrate how machine learning techniques allow us to analyze
the quality of such mortality models. In addition, we present how these
techniques can be used for differentiating the different causes of death in
mortality modeling.

regional style (e.g., Japanese, Mediterranean, or Italian). This system has two
characteristics. First the system can identify the degree of regional cuisine
style mixture of any selected recipe and visualize such regional cuisine style
mixtures using barycentric Newton diagrams. Second, the system can suggest
ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe
becomes more authentic for any selected regional cuisine style. Drawing on a
large number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system
can transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.

can be used to enhance health standards by predicting health related
trajectories in societies with large populations. These data are often
available in large quantities across U.S. states and require Big Data
techniques to uncover complex hidden patterns. We design two different classes
of models suitable for large-scale analysis of mortality data, a Hadoop-based
ensemble of random forests trained over N-grams, and the DeepDeath, a deep
classifier based on the recurrent neural network (RNN). We apply both classes
to the mortality data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and
show that while both perform significantly better than the random classifier,
the deep model that utilizes long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), surpasses
the N-gram based models and is capable of learning the temporal aspect of the
data without a need for building ad-hoc, expert-driven features.

some Ng's results to the general case. In particular, we show that, a locally
compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ is co-amenable if and only if the
contra-corepresentation of its fundamental multiplicative unitary
$W_{\mathbb{G}}$ is Bekka amenable, and $\mathbb{G}$ is amenable if and only if
its dual quantum group's fundamental multiplicative unitary
$W_{\widehat{\mathbb{G}}}$ is weakly Bekka amenable.

its prime spectrum is studied, that with the co-Zariski topology it is compact.

commutative rings and rigs are presented with which this theory keeps a close
